In December 2025, fellow former GAA player Charlie Smyth, from Mayobridge in County Down, followed in his footsteps.",

    "description": "The Super Bowl is in 13 days, but first, the NFL draft community has plenty of time to produce mock […]",
    "fullText": "The Super Bowl is in 13 days, but first, the NFL draft community has plenty of time to produce mock drafts, as seven rounds of new rookies will join the big leagues in three months. And according to NFL.com, the latest and greatest theory for the Minnesota Vikings involves Toledo safety Emmanuel McNeil-Warren.\n\nMcNeil-Warren’s name is rising as a rookie safety option, and the Smith succession question may force Minnesota’s hand.\n\nMcNeil-Warren ranks 39th on the Consensus Big Board as of January 27th, but that didn’t stop Daniel Jeremiah from mock-drafting him to the purple team.\n\nA Harrison Smith replacement is on the mind of NFL.com.\n\nAt the 18th pick, Jeremiah picked McNeil-Warren for Minnesota and noted, “I’m higher on McNeil-Warren than some other people around the league, but I love his combination of size and explosive playmaking ability. He could help replace Harrison Smith if the soon-to-be 37-year-old does indeed retire.”\n\nBefore the Vikings’ pick, Jeremiah mocked Akheem Mesidor, an EDGE rusher from Miami, to the Detroit Lions, and at No. 19, Arizona State wideout Jordan Tyson landed with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nNaturally, as you will see in every mock draft, Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza went No. 1 overall to the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nMcNeil-Warren is 6’2″ and 202 pounds with 4.5 speed. He’s got the size. The Toledo Rocket is known for forcing turnovers, which the Vikings could obviously use in 2026 and beyond. He also has the length, burst, and ability worthy of the 1st Round, though general managers often don’t consider safeties as premium assets, like cornerbacks.\n\nNFL Draft Buzz on McNeil-Warren: “His combination of length, improving instincts, and proven ability to generate game-changing plays positions him as the type of safety who could thrive in a role-specific capacity early before expanding his responsibilities.”\n\n“The modern NFL’s emphasis on versatile defensive backs who can match up with tight ends and provide run support from depth aligns perfectly with his skill set, though defensive coordinators will need patience developing his deep coverage reliability. His ceiling depends heavily on continued refinement of his anticipation and pattern recognition – the mental processing that separates good college safeties from NFL starters.”\n\nAnother Toledo defensive back took off after being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2024: cornerback Quinyon Mitchell.\n\nNBD added on McNeill-Warren, “The flashes are there, particularly his pick-six against Western Kentucky that demonstrated his growth reading quarterback intentions, but consistency remains elusive. Teams running primarily split-safety coverages where he can work from depth and leverage his closing speed downhill would maximize his immediate impact while minimizing exposure to his weaknesses in isolated deep coverage situations.”\n\n“While he may never become an elite single-high free safety, McNeil-Warren possesses the tools and competitive drive to carve out a decade-long career as a valuable chess piece in creative defensive schemes that value versatility and playmaking over pure coverage ability.”\n\nThe Job Lewis Cine Should’ve Filled\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Vikings shouldn’t need safety right now. The here and now was supposed to be the time that 2022 1st-Rounder Lewis Cine entered his prime. But after Cine broke his leg as a rookie and never gained his footing in the defense thereafter, Minnesota dropped Cine a couple of offseasons ago, one of the worst busts in Vikings history.\n\nCine now plays in the UFL, along with high-round 2022 draft mate, cornerback Andrew Booth.\n\nHad general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah hit on Cine, he would not have to entertain a high-round draft pick on a safety like McNeill-Warren. That’s why draft busts are so impactful and damning.\n\nNot So Fast on Smith’s Retirement?\n\nMinnesota extended defensive coordinator Brian Flores’s contract last week, nominating him for a return in 2026. And while fans had a going-away party for Harrison Smith a few weeks ago in Week 18, a source told VikingsTerritory last weekend that Smith’s retirement is not a foregone conclusion. The 36-year-old has a “hard time walking away,” per the source, and Flores’s renewal with the Vikings could lure Smith back for Year No. 15.\n\nIf that happens, the Vikings would still need an eventual Smith replacement, but it may not be in the 1st Round of the NFL draft. The team would basically buy itself another year.\n\nFinal note: safeties are usually pretty easy to find in free agency. If Minnesota doesn’t prefer the draft for a safety, about 10 startable options will be available on the open market in March. Players like Kamren Curl (Los Angeles Rams) and Jalen Thompson (Arizona Cardinals) will be available in six weeks if their current teams don’t renew their contracts.",

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers went heavy on their top needs in a three-round 2026 NFL mock draft from the Draft Wire.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have a host of needs to address in the 2026 NFL draft as they continue piecing together an on-the-fly roster transition they hope helps them avoid a full-blown rebuild.\n\nA key piece of their success in that quest will be finding high-level talent via the draft. Free agency will cover some of their roster holes, but the draft is where long-term, sustainable success is found. That's why their trio of selections in a three-round projection from our friends at the Draft Wire make a ton of sense, even if they don't tackle some of the team's most immediate needs.\n\nHere's a quick look at their three picks:\n\nThe skinny: Concepcion hauled in 16 touchdowns across two seasons at North Carolina State, including a whopping 10 as a freshman. His numbers dipped some in his second season before transferring to Texas A&M where he found immediate success in the SEC. Last year he hauled in 61 receptions for 919 yards and nine touchdowns. Perhaps the most intriguing part of Concepcion's game is what he can do with the ball in his hands. He racked up 431 yards and three touchdowns on 70 carries in his college career. Concepcion also added punt return duties last season where he tallied a pair of touchdowns on 25 returns.\n\nThe skinny: McNeil-Warren would be a really interesting addition for an evolving 49ers defense. His size is evident on film and his production across four years at Toledo is strong. In 48 games he racked up 214 tackles with 11 tackles for loss, five interceptions, 17 pass breakups and nine forced fumbles. His length and athleticism would give San Francisco a new style of safety who can conceivably be a more dynamic option in the back end of their defense than either of the Ji'Ayir Brown-Malik Mustapha duo provides.\n\nThe skinny: There's a lot to like just looking at Josephs. His frame is leaner than his 6-3, 240-pound listing would suggest and he brings really good length that he uses to move blockers. His athleticism looks okay on tape, but he looks a little stiff coming off the edge which may be part of the reason he's a third-round projection this early in the draft process. Josephs spent four years at Tennessee and posted 104 tackles, 22 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks. Josephs also notched four pass breakups and six forced fumbles. More depth on the edge should be a priority in this draft for the 49ers and Josephs has a lot of desirable tools.\n\nMore 49ers: Should the 49ers re-sign DL Yetur Gross-Matos in free agency?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 2026 NFL draft: 49ers pick KC Concepcion, 2 others in 3-round mock",

    "fullText": "As the 2026 season approaches, several NFL teams remain in search of the right leader to guide their next chapter. These openings reflect franchises at different crossroads, whether rebuilding, retooling, or trying to push a talented roster over the top. The decisions made in the coming weeks will shape not only next season, but the long-term direction of each organization.\n\nArizona’s opening represents a chance to fully reset the organization’s direction. The roster has young talent but lacks consistency and identity, making this a pivotal hire. The Cardinals must decide whether to prioritize offensive innovation or cultural rebuilding. Their next coach will likely be tasked with long-term development rather than immediate contention.\n\nThe Bills’ vacancy is one of the most attractive jobs on the market due to a strong core and established expectations. However, the pressure to win immediately will narrow the candidate pool. Buffalo needs a leader who can manage high expectations while refining late-game execution. The next coach will be judged quickly by postseason results.\n\nCleveland’s search reflects ongoing instability at the top despite roster talent. The Browns need a coach who can unify the locker room and bring clarity to both sides of the ball. Consistency and leadership will matter as much as schematic prowess. This hire could define the franchise’s direction for years.\n\nThe Raiders continue searching for a coach who can stabilize a franchise defined by constant change. Las Vegas needs a strong cultural leader capable of commanding respect in a demanding market. Identity, discipline, and accountability are key priorities. The next hire must balance star power with structure.\n\nFor teams still searching, patience and clarity will be just as important as splash or star power. The right hire can stabilize a franchise and establish an identity, while the wrong one can set progress back years. How these teams finish the coaching carousel may ultimately define the balance of the league heading into 2026.\n\nThe post NFL: Teams still looking for new head coaches appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "It doesn't seem possible, but it was actually 34 years ago on Monday.\n\nThat's right, I remember it so well. It was January 26, 1992, in Super Bowl XXVI, and Washington jumped out to a 17-0 halftime lead over the Buffalo Bills. On the Bills' first second-half possession, linebacker Kurt Gouveia intercepted a Jim Kelly pass, nearly returning it for a touchdown. Gerald Riggs hammered the ball into the end zone, and it was 24-0 Redskins.\n\nREDEMPTION!\nJanuary 26, 1992\n\nFour years after \"The Fumble\" in the AFC Championship with the #Browns in Denver, running back Earnest Byner scores the first touchdown of Super Bowl XXVI en route to the Redskins' third Super Bowl title.#HTTR #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/FWP0mbSpwV\n\n— Kevin Gallagher (@KevG163) January 26, 2026\n\nEarly in the final quarter, Mark Rypien, Earnest Byner, the Hogs, and the Posse (Art Monk, Gary Clark, Ricky Sanders), Charles Mann, Wilber Marshall, Darrell Green, and the rest of the Redskins were destroying the AFC Champion Bills 37-10. The game's final several minutes were anticlimactic, much less intense, with cameras showing Redskins on the sidelines laughing and enjoying themselves on their way to another Super Bowl championship, as the Bills scored two late scores for a 37-24 final.\n\nIt was Joe Jackson Gibbs' fourth Super Bowl with Washington and the third he had won. He had amazingly won those three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks who were not Hall of Fame quarterbacks (Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, Mark Rypien). He also won with three different starting running backs (John Riggins, Timmy Smith, Earnest Byner). OT Joe Jacoby, C Jeff Bostic, WR Art Monk, TE Don Warren, G Russ Grimm and LB Monte Coleman played on all four of those Gibbs teams.\n\nSince that time Washington head coaches have been Richie Petitbon, Norv Turner, Terry Robiskie, Marty Schottenheimer, Steve Spurrier, Joe Gibbs again (2004-2007), Jim Zorn, Mike Shanahan, Jay Gruden, Bill Callahan, Ron Rivera, and Dan Quinn.\n\nYes, a lot has changed for Washington in the last 34 years, sadly, even the name.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: 34 years ago was franchise's last Super Bowl",

    "fullText": "It’s probably been a while since you’ve heard the name Bob Quinn, but the former Detroit Lions general manager is back in the news.\n\nAfter the Lions parted ways with Quinn in the middle of the 2020 season, he eventually joined the Cleveland Browns as a senior consultant. The next year, he was promoted to senior personnel/coaching executive, allowing him to work on both the coaching and team personnel side of the business.\n\nBut with the Browns’ latest regime dissolved in the midst of a new head coaching search, Quinn is leaving the organization and following former Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski to the Atlanta Falcons. His new role appears to be solely on the coaching side, as his title is senior advisor to the head coach.\n\nIt’s an interesting career arc for Quinn, who had worked solely on the personnel side of the business when he joined the Lions in 2016. He rose up the ranks in the New England Patriots’ scouting department for 15 years before landing the general manager job with the Lions. His time in Detroit was very mixed. On one hand, he made some impressive picks along the offensive line (Taylor Decker, Graham Glasgow, Frank Ragnow). On the other hand, he’ll always be haunted by the picks of Jarrad Davis, Teez Tabor, Jahlani Tavai, and Jeff Okudah. What ultimately sank his career the most was the decision to hire Matt Patricia as the team’s head coach—a disaster that set the franchise back several years.\n\nBut it speaks volumes that Stefanski—a two-time AP NFL Coach of the Year—trusts Quinn as his right-hand man on the coaching side of football.

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "description": "With the NFL Playoffs in the books and the Super Bowl on the horizon, Scott Pianowski takes a look at a quintet of players who have boosted their stock.",
    "fullText": "The fantasy football season effectively ended a month ago, but it’s important to scout the NFL playoff games as potential clues for 2026 value. Today, let’s discuss some players who have improved their stock since it got cold, be it with late-December rallies or impressive showings in the postseason.\n\nGive Mike Vrabel credit for not mothballing Stevenson after some early-season fumbling issues. The Patriots hitched up to Stevenson in the playoffs, giving him 45 touches the last two weeks, including 25 in the AFC Championship win over the Broncos. He currently has 194 rushing yards for the playoffs, tops in the NFL.\n\nMeanwhile, TreVeyon Henderson saw just three opportunities (three forgettable runs) in the victory at Denver. Henderson was the home-run hitter in this backfield most of the year, with Stevenson the steady grinder; come playoff time, the Pats have leaned into the grinder. And Stevenson was trusted much \n\nFigure on Stevenson getting a bell cow workload in the Super Bowl, and earning the higher ADP in next summer’s draft season.\n\nEveryone remembers his “hello world” moment, the 6-118-2 detonation at Cincinnati, including the game-winning touchdown. But the Bears didn’t completely hand Loveland the keys to the kingdom until after Christmas. He absorbed 48 targets over his final four games (including the playoffs), good for a 28-378-2 log.\n\nThis is going to push Loveland into pricy areas for next year’s fantasy drafts, but I’m here for it. Caleb Williams is also on the escalator and Ben Johnson is the right man with the play sheet.\n\nSean McVay usually employs a very narrow offense for fantasy purposes, relying on just a handful of skill players. But that tree expanded during the 2025 season, with Corum starting to become a proactive complement to starting RB Kyren Williams. Corum was the team’s most effective back in Sunday’s loss at Seattle (12 touches, 79 scrimmage yards), and he received double-digit touches in six of his final eight games. Corum also had six touchdowns on the year, with five of them coming after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Rams haven’t soured on Williams and he’ll be the clear starter entering 2026. But Corum probably has 8-12 touch equity in any game where he’s healthy, and he’ll shoot past that projection every now and then, if the Rams want to steer into a hot hand. Corum is on the flex radar for 2026 fantasy planning, and he’s just one injury away from being a needle mover, too.\n\nI don’t know how to quit this guy. Mims was an afterthought for most of the year but he was forced into action during the playoffs, coming through with a nifty 12-155-1 line on 14 targets. I get it, the Broncos have a crowded receiver room, and Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant are still ascending talents. But let’s not forget that Mims will only be 24 next year, too. Mims has already scored 11 regular-season touchdowns despite limited opportunities, and he’s dynamic as a kick returner. He’s screaming for a bigger role.\n\nJust making the NFL as an undrafted receiver out of Holy Cross is a big win for Coker, but he’s not content to stop there. He stepped forward in his final six starts, posting a 28-378-4 log, including that 134-yard explosion against the Rams. Coker has good size and the ability to high point the ball, which gives him the potential to score 8-10 touchdowns in a full season, even with Tetairoa McMillan already on the team. Coker will be a trendy fantasy sleeper next summer, but I’ll still try to get a seat near the front of that bandwagon.",

    "fullText": "After winning their respective conference championship games on Jan. 25, the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots punched their tickets to Super Bowl LX\n\nThe NFL championship game will take place on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nGreen Day, Charlie Puth and Bad Bunny will take the Super Bowl 2026 stage\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots are set to face off in football's biggest showdown.\n\nHeld on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., the 2026 Super Bowl will not only crown this year's NFL champion but also mark 60 years since the first game was played. To commemorate the milestone, Green Day will deliver a special opening performance before the teams take center stage, ushering generations of Super Bowl MVPs onto the field.\n\n“Celebrating 60 years of Super Bowl history with Green Day as a hometown band, while honoring the NFL legends who’ve helped define this sport, is an incredibly powerful way to kick off Super Bowl LX,” Tim Tubito, the league’s senior director of event and game presentation, told the Associated Press in January 2026.\n\nThough fans are amped for the 2026 Super Bowl's musical stars — which also include Charlie Puth and Bad Bunny — the main act will be on the field.\n\nPatriots quarterback Drake Maye will lead the team back to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019, giving the franchise a chance at its seventh title and its first without Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. On the other side, Seattle returns to the Super Bowl with Sam Darnold at the helm, looking to secure its second Lombardi Trophy after winning its first in 2014.\n\nHere's everything to know about the 2026 Super Bowl, including the full performance lineup.\n\nSuper Bowl LX is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026.\n\nThis year's NFL championship game will be held at Levi's Stadium, home to the San Francisco 49ers, in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nWhile the Patriots' last Super Bowl appearance was a win in 2019, the Seahawks' last championship game was in 2015 — when they lost 28-24 against the Patriots. The Seahawks have previously made three total appearances in the Super Bowl — 2006, 2014 and 2015 — and won once, in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, the Patriots have made 11 appearances in the Super Bowl — more than any other team — and won six games. If they win in February, they will have the most ever wins in Super Bowl history.\n\nWhile all six wins have previously taken place during Brady and Belichick's era, Maye emphasized the team’s fresh chapter after the Patriots beat the Denver Broncos 10-7 at the AFC Championship game on Jan. 25.\n\n“It’s a new team, it’s a new era,” he told Boston.com. “I respect and appreciate what the Patriots dynasty did, and unfortunately they didn’t come out with some wins here, but we changed that narrative and look forward to bringing our best football for [the Super Bowl].”\n\nIn September 2025, the NFL announced that Bad Bunny (born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) would perform at the 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show. The \"MONACO\" rapper shared his excitement about the honor in a statement at the time.\n\n“What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,\" he explained. \"It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nFans will also be treated to a lineup of killer performances before the game even starts. Green Day will kick off the events with an opening ceremony to \"welcome the MVPs who’ve shaped the game and open the night for fans all over the world,\" frontman Billie Joe Armstrong said in a statement.\n\nAfter that, Puth will sing the national anthem, followed by 11-time Grammy winner Brandi Carlile performing \"America the Beautiful.\" Coco Jones will also give a rendition of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" to close out the pregame ceremony.\n\nAccording to the NFL, the 2026 Super Bowl kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET / 3:30 p.m. PT. Green Day's opening ceremony performance will start airing a half-hour earlier at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT.\n\nThose who aren't catching the game live in California can watch it broadcast on NBC and Telemundo, per the NFL. Fans can also tune in on the NFL app or stream the game on Peacock.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor a few years, there existed a conspiracy theory that the colors of the Super Bowl logo predicted which two teams would play for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nWell, that one is out, and a new theory is in.\n\nSome NFL fans believe a preseason graphic the league posted to its social media accounts actually predicted the seemingly unpredictable Super Bowl 60 matchup between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, two teams that hadn't won a playoff game since 2019 before this season.\n\nHere's a look at the graphic behind the NFL's newest \"script writer\" conspiracy theory.\n\nMORE:Super Bowl 60 odds, spread as Seahawks open as favorites\n\nAfter the Patriots and Seahawks punched their ticket to the Super Bowl, fans started to notice which two quarterbacks seem to be closer to the giant Lombardi Trophy than the rest in this graphic posted by the NFL on the first day of the regular season:\n\n— RedditCFB (@RedditCFB) January 26, 2026\n\nA closer inspection reveals you can make the case Baker Mayfield was actually closer than Darnold, or that Travis Hunter seems to be the closest to the trophy.\n\nThis is no time for facts, though. NFL fans have unearthed the latest grand Super Bowl conspiracy, and it's true that Maye and Darnold were both front and center in relation to the Lombardi Trophy in the graphic just as they are in reality today.\n\n\"They really gave us the script in September,\" the lead Drake Maye fan account tweeted Sunday night.\n\nThey really gave us the script in September https://t.co/ofeVgBdbPb\n\n— Drake Maye Lover (@drakemayeloverr) January 26, 2026\n\nAnother look at the graphic reveals the NFL probably believed a Patriots-Seahawks Super Bowl was enormously unlikely. The sport's biggest names are front-and-center, from Saquon Barkley and Patrick Mahomes to Brock Purdy and Joe Burrow. Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen are also closer to Mahomes and Barkley than they are to Maye and Darnold in the distance.\n\nConsidering players from the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Tennessee Titans are standing nearly shoulder-to-shoulder with Maye and Darnold in the distance, it seems more like the league discounted the Patriots and Seahawks than predicted their Super Bowl 60 meeting.\n\nWhy let the finer details get in the way of a good conspiracy theory, though?\n\nSeahawks take down Rams to advance to Super Bowl 60\n\nSam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba star for Seahawks in NFC championship\n\nRams' special teams blunders continue in NFC championship\n\nSeahawks Pope trend continues with Super Bowl 60 berth",

    "description": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale.",
    "fullText": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale. He was labeled a bust with the New York Jets, flamed out in Carolina, faded into the background in San Francisco, and was ultimately discarded by the Minnesota Vikings. Eight seasons later, that narrative is officially dead.\n\nOn Sunday night, Darnold delivered the defining performance of his career, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Seattle Seahawks to a 31–27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game. The victory sends Seattle to Super Bowl LX. And sends Darnold’s critics scrambling.\n\n“I mean, he just shut a lot of people up tonight,” Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said after the game. “So I’m really happy for him.”\n\nDarnold was sensational from start to finish, matching throws with MVP candidate Matthew Stafford on the game’s biggest stage. He connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a momentum-swinging touchdown with 20 seconds left in the first half, flipping the game in Seattle’s favor.\n\nFollowing a disastrous Rams special teams mistake, Darnold capitalized by firing a strike to Jake Bobo over the middle for another score. Later, he ripped a perfectly placed spiral through Los Angeles’ zone coverage to Cooper Kupp for a 13-yard touchdown, the play that ultimately proved decisive.\n\nThe performance was a masterclass in poise and precision. Darnold finished 25-of-36 passing with zero interceptions, repeatedly delivering when the moment demanded it most.\n\nSeattle complemented Darnold’s brilliance with timely defense and game-changing special teams. Devon Witherspoon made back-to-back pass breakups inside the six-yard line late in the fourth quarter, forcing a turnover on downs that kept the Rams off the scoreboard.\n\nOn special teams, the Seahawks forced two muffed punts from Rams returner Xavier Smith, recovering the second to set up Darnold’s touchdown pass to Bobo.\n\n“It’s a team win,” Macdonald said. “And then, you can’t talk about the game without talking about our quarterback.”\n\nFor Darnold, this marks his first NFC Championship win as a starter. He previously earned a conference title as a backup with the 49ers during their Super Bowl run two years ago, but this one was different — this one was his.\n\nAfter five teams, nearly 3,000 pass attempts, and almost eight full seasons in the league, Darnold has become the first quarterback from the vaunted 2018 draft class, which included Baker Mayfield and MVPs Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson, to win a conference championship as a starter.\n\nWhen his best was required, Sam Darnold delivered it. Two weeks from now in Santa Clara, he’ll have a chance to put the final stamp on a career resurrection that once seemed impossible.\n\nThe post Seahawks News: Mike Macdonald Says Sam Darnold “Shut a Lot of People Up” With 3-TD Game vs. Rams appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "As the NFL makes more and more officiating misses subject to replay review, the lingering blind spots become more and more glaring.\n\nIt's time (in fact, it's long overdue) for missed facemask fouls to be called via replay.\n\nThere's no reason not to do it. Replay currently can be used to undo an erroneous facemask call. Why shouldn't it be used when a clear and obvious foul was missed?\n\nIt happened during the second quarter of Sunday's NFC Championship, when Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had his facemask grabbed on a third-down sack that forced a field goal. If the penalty hadn't been missed, the Rams would have gotten 15 yards and a fresh set of downs.\n\nSome would say the NFL resists using replay to put a flag on the field. From its inception, however, the current replay rules have allowed a penalty to be called for having too many men on the field.\n\nToday, too many things are reviewable to justify omitting something that requires no subjectivity. And it's eventually going to affect a huge game, in a huge spot.\n\nIt affected today's huge NFC Championship, ending a potential touchdown drive that could have tied the game at 10 and forcing the Rams to settle for three. And it's a flaw that can easily be fixed.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL playoffs are upon us, with the NFC and AFC title games on tap, and as the stakes change so do the overtime rules. Let's dive into exactly how before the final two pre-Super Bowl games get going.\n\nBoth teams get at least one possession in overtime, a rule change made after the controversial 2022 AFC Championship game. The Buffalo Bills lost that one to the Kansas City Chiefs after failing to get a possession in overtime, as you might recall.\n\nA playoff game also cannot end in a tie, so if the score is even after the first overtime period, the teams will play as many are needed for a winner to emerge. Between each overtime period a two-minute intermission will take place. Additionally, the second and fourth overtime periods are subject to the same timing rules as the second and fourth regulation periods.\n\nLike the regular season, overtime will not feature any instant replay coach's challenges as all reviews are initiated by the replay official.\n\nNo playoff games went to overtime last season, so perhaps we're due for some this year. There's nothing better than some extra football, especially in the playoffs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Overtime rules for NFL playoffs in NFC, AFC conference championships",

    "fullText": "It’s a scary thought for the NFL that Drake Maye hasn’t necessarily reached his full potential.\n\nMaye can conclude his second season with a Super Bowl appearance if the New England Patriots defeat the Denver Broncos on Sunday. The 23-year-old quarterback is also an MVP finalist after completing 72 percent of his passes for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns.\n\nCapturing a Lombardi Trophy could help establish Maye as one of the league’s premier signal-callers. When asked how good he could become during CBS’s pre-game coverage of the AFC Championship Game, former Pro Bowl offensive lineman Kyle Long declared that the sky is the limit.\n\n“There is no ceiling,” Long said. “From a physical standpoint, from a personality standpoint, from a toughness standpoint, he checks all the boxes.”\n\nMaye endured an uneven rookie campaign for the 4-13 Patriots, but they’ve reversed that record behind an improved roster. Long celebrated Maye’s maturation alongside a bolstered supporting cast and praised the North Carolina native’s humility.\n\n“He’s proved it all season long,” Long added. “He’s unbelievably accurate, but I think the thing that stands out the most … his personality. He’s got an ‘Aw shucks’ about him.”\n\nMaye has been far from perfect this postseason, losing three of six fumbles and throwing an interception in each game. However, he also averaged 9.2 yards per pass attempt in a 16-3 win over the Los Angeles Chargers and tossed three touchdowns against the Houston Texans’ No. 1-ranked defense in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nSurviving another stout Broncos defense could help Maye quickly stamp his place in Patriots lore and continue his ascension to superstardom.\n\nHow Patriots Would Make NFL History With AFC Championship Game Win Vs.

And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold can make USC history. Other Trojans will play huge roles as they all try to make the Super Bowl",
    "fullText": "We are one week closer to the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. This weekend will determine which two teams will make it to the Super Bowl. In both games, the former USC Trojans will play a huge factor and have their fingerprints all over games with the Super Bowl up for grabs. Sam Darnold not only has his legacy on the line, but also a chance to represent his alma mater for the first time on the NFL's biggest stage.\n\nHere are my predictions for championship weekend in the NFL:\n\nSam Darnold and the Seahawks will enter the biggest game in recent memory for the former NFC juggernaut. This time around, they enter with a defense similar to the Legion of Boom but an offense that is more well-rounded. Seattle has looked miles ahead of the other playoff teams left. I think the Rams will give them a challenge and this game will come down to the last drive, but Seattle has proven themselves to be the better team between the two teams in this matchup. They can blowout teams, they can win close, low-score games, and they can win shootouts. I think this game, Sam Darnold, and the Seahawks offense will have to be at its best, but I think Darnold will deliver the best quarterback performance in this matchup. Seattle will move on and represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.\n\nMany might gift wrap this win to the Patriots with Bo Nix being out for the rest of the season, but I disagree. I think the Patriots come out on top, but they will have to work for this game. The Broncos' defense will need former USC Trojan Talanoa Hufanga to fly around and make plays all day. The Patriots' offense has struggled to keep Drake Maye upright in each of their playoff games. Maye has been sacked 5 times. That is where the Broncos' defense specializes. Their defensive line can get after their quarterback like no other. The Broncos' defense will keep them in this game; it will come down to whether or not he can put together his best Nick Foles impression. I think he will play well, but not well enough to win this football game. I think he will come up short late and throw a costly interception, and Drake Maye and Mike Vrabel will iron out this victory in a low-scoring defensive battle.\n\nI think Sam Darnold saves his biggest performance for the game right before the Super Bowl. Darnold squeaked by Stafford and the Rams in the last meeting between the two teams in an overtime win. Darnold will have to play exactly like he did down the stretch in that game to get the victory in this one. I think Darnold reaches 300 yards through the air, and he and Jaxon Smith-Njigba light up the Rams' secondary. This secondary has given up their fair share of big games to their opponent. This game will be no different. Jaxon Smith-Njigba will have over 100 yards receiving, and he will connect with Sam Darnold for two touchdowns in this game. I think Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba have the two biggest performances in the NFC Championship game.\n\nIn the AFC, I think pass rusher Nik Bonitto has the most dominant performance. The Patriots have given up 5 sacks in each of their playoff games. In the last game versus the Texans, Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. combined for 5 sacks. Bonitto this season had 14 sacks. I think he will have 3 sacks in this game and disrupt Drake Maye all game long.\n\nI think defensive tackle Milton Williams will also have himself a big game and disrupt the Broncos on the other end. Williams has been a huge reason for the Patriots' defensive turnaround, and he was great all regular season long. He creates pressure from the interior with the best of them, and he is a great run stopper. I think he will lead this Patriots defensive line to make the Broncos one-dimensional and take out their run game. Williams will also lead the Patriots in sacks with two. Verus the Chargers, Williams had two sacks, and against the Texans, he was an irritant all game long, forcing the pick 6 that took the momentum away from Houston initially. I think Milton Williams will use all of that to have his best playoff game with the Patriots and help send his team to the Super Bowl.\n\nMy Super Bowl matchup prediction is the New England Patriots taking on the Seattle Seahawks. The Patriots have had quite the Super Bowl run vs tough defenses, but they still will not be prepared for the Seahawks' defense. Mike Macdonald and the Seahawks defense will make it a tough day for young star quarterback Drake Maye. I think his age and inexperience will come back to bite him in this match. I think Rashid Shaheed will pay homage to Devin Hester and take the opening kickoff back for a touchdown, setting the tone for the entire game. I think Darnold will not have to do much to be the top quarterback on the field, but he still will put up a respectable performance. Seattle will play their last complete performance of the season, getting their Super Bowl victory. Darnold will look to be greedy and not just settle for being the first Trojan quarterback to start in the Super Bowl, but he will also become the first Trojan quarterback to win a Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Predictions for USC on championship weekend in NFL playoffs",

    "fullText": "Jarrett Stidham chose to remain with the Denver Broncos last offseason.\n\nWith his initial two-year deal set to expire last March, Stidham drew interest from other NFL teams — including the New England Patriots — but he opted to re-sign with the Broncos on another two-year contract.\n\nTen months later, Stidham is set to start for Denver against New England in the AFC Championship game on Sunday following Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury. After practice on Wednesday, Stidham was asked about his decision to re-sign with the Broncos in 2025.\n\n“There are always opportunities out there and stuff, but I think at the end of the day, there was a combination of things that went into my decision to come back here,\" Stidham said. \"I believe in Sean [Payton], and Davis [Webb] and Joe [Lombardi], and our room, and being behind Bo and helping him grow. I take a lot of pride in that.\n\n\"I felt like, over the last two years that I was here, that I got a lot better. I think the way Davis has coached us over these last three years now has really helped all of us improve. That’s just one thing I wanted to come back and be a part of. I felt like being here the last two years, and coming in with Sean, and signing and everything, it’s pretty evident that he has the train rolling in the right direction. I don’t think anybody can argue that, and I wanted to be a part of it.”\n\nStidham was one of Payton's first free agent signings when the coach arrived in 2023, and Payton has made it clear that he has faith in Stidham. After three years in a backup role, Stidham now gets an opportunity to step up and make history.

    "description": "According to the rumor, the NFL's 2025 Super Bowl MVP donated $300,000 of his own money as a way of kick-starting the special fund.",
    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund — in honor of the woman fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis in January 2026 —and contributed $300,000.\n\nIn January 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund. Users' posts claimed the NFL's Super Bowl LIX MVP kickstarted the fund himself, contributing $300,000 of his own money.\n\nThe purported scholarship fund referenced Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident shot fatally shot on Jan. 7 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross.\n\nFor example, on Jan. 20, a user managing the NFL Pulse Facebook page posted (archived) an image collage of three pictures allegedly showing Hurts hugging Good's 6-year-old son on a football field, Good holding her son in front of a body of water and Hurts walking inside a football stadium. The post's text claimed Good's killing inspired Hurts to launch the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, including the $300,000 contribution.\n\nIn short, the rumor was false. One or more users fabricated and promoted the claim with the help of images and text generated with artificial-intelligence tools.\n\nSnopes contacted a manager of the NFL Pulse Facebook page to ask about the fictional stories and AI-generated content displayed on the feed, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles to request an official statement, and will update this story if we receive more information.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post (archived) — as well as other Facebook posts sharing the same rumor — featured links leading to advertisement-filled articles hosted on WordPress blogs. The users owning those blogs earned revenue based on the combination of advertising and made-up stories. The NFL Pulse post redirected to an article on on such untrustworthy website.\n\nSearches of Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google found no news media outlets reporting about Hurts establishing a scholarship fund in Good's name. A Yahoo search did, however, mistakenly produce an AI-generated answer wrongly confirming the rumor as true. Outlets would have widely reported on the story involving Hurts and Good, had it truly occurred.\n\nRegarding the fake, AI-generated photo of Hurts holding Good's son, the most evident sign of AI — aside from the misspelling of \"Eagles\" as \"Eaglees\" — was the reality that sports and standard news outlets would have very widely publicized the moment, had the meeting between the quarterback and young boy truly taken place.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post's text, presented in its entirety later in this article, featured over-dramatic wording common with AI tools. For example, one part of the post read, \"This was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\" Additionally, the idea that individuals or teams aiming to rapidly produce inauthentic content for ad revenue would carefully, slowly and manually write text for their articles simply does not square with reality.\n\nThe person or people who authored the story about Hurts and Good fabricated the entire claim as one of hundreds of inspirational tales that depicted celebrities and athletes performing inspiring acts of kindness. Such stories resemble glurge, which Dictionary.com defines as stories \"that are supposed to be true and uplifting, but which are often fabricated and sentimental.\"\n\nFor readers interested in the story told in the NFL Pulse Facebook post, the post presented the made-up tale as follows:\n\nJalen Hurts has officially established The Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, personally committing an initial $300,000 donation to honor the life of Renee Nicole Good — a mother whose story ended in tragedy after she was killed in Minneapolis, a loss that left an entire community grieving.\n\nBut this gesture goes far beyond a financial contribution.\n\nJalen Hurts founded the scholarship fund himself to ensure that Renee's 6-year-old son will receive full educational support from elementary school through college — including tuition, books, tutoring, and opportunities for personal development. Alongside the financial commitment, Jalen also dedicated his voice, his platform, and his heart to a child now facing a world without his mother.\n\nThis was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\n\nAcross the nation, many were moved not by the amount of money pledged, but by the meaning behind Jalen's decision: a promise that Renee Nicole Good's life mattered, and that her son's future will be protected, supported, and filled with hope.\n\nFor further reading, we previously reported about the time tech billionaire Elon Musk deleted a post supporting the Eagles supporting the Eagles after they lost the 2023 Super Bowl LVII.\n\n\"GLURGE Definition & Meaning.\" Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/glurge.\n\nHuberman, Bond, and David Emery. \"Snopestionary: What Does 'Glurge' Mean?\" Snopes, 21 Aug. 2021, https://www.snopes.com//articles/363643/what-does-glurge-mean/.",

    "description": "Detroit Lions LB Jack Campbell is the recipient of the 2025 Pro Butkus Award.",
    "fullText": "Detroit Lions linebacker Jack Campbell has been named the recipient of the 2025 Pro Butkus Award. The award, which is more known for the identical college honors, goes to the top linebacker in the NFL, as voted on by Butkus Award Selection Committee—a selection of 51 voters from all ranks of football, including NFL front office members, scouts, and coaches.\n\n“Jack Campbell embodies everything the Butkus Award represents,” the committee said in a statement (via Hawkeyesports.com). “His size, instincts and disciplined approach to the position allow him to control the middle of the field. He plays with authority, communicates at a high level, and consistently puts himself in position to make impactful plays. His rise this season reflects not just talent, but leadership and football character.”\n\nCampbell’s 2025 season was a breakout for the third-year linebacker. He was named First-Team All Pro after tallying 176 tackles, nine tackles for loss, 5.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, and two fumble recoveries.\n\n“He’s extremely valuable,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said in December. “Right now, first of all he leads the team in amount of reps that he’s played for a season. He’s taken more reps than anybody on this team. He plays on kickoff for us and he’s an asset on kickoff and then everything you see on defense. He doesn’t come off the field, he’s our bell cow, green dot. And he does—and the guy is smart and he’s instinctive and he is snap-to-whistle all-out, all the time, in practice too. And he doesn’t take plays off, he doesn’t take days off, he goes after the football, he’s a ball guy. So, he’s invaluable.”\n\nInterestingly, this is the second time Campbell has won the award. Back in 2022, he won the college version of the award after a standout year with the Iowa Hawkeyes. That season, Campbell posted 128 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.\n\nCampbell is heading into the fourth and final year of his rookie contract, although the Lions have an opportunity to exercise a fifth-year option worth a projected $16.4 million. The deadline to exercise that option is May 1. But the Lions may very well sign Campbell to a contract extension before then.",

    "description": "Udinski is a rising star, but not ready for an NFL head coach position.",
    "fullText": "With the victories come the spoils, or the losses. The losses don’t show up on the scoreboard, but in the pieces that are lost from the victor’s staff. Such is the potential for the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason with their staff. Defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile recently had a second interview with the Arizona Cardinals, this time in person. But he is not the only Jacksonville coordinator attracting attention from other NFL teams. Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski has been identified as someone who could one day become a head coach. The Buffalo Bills, who recently fired their head coach, are seeking a new coach and have reached out to Udinski for an interview. The 30-year-old Udinski is considered a very bright offensive mind, and he could be really considered by Buffalo for their head coaching position. But life always has a way of showing us the mistakes we made.\n\nHiring coaches who have not called plays offensively has been shown to us before. In fact, the Tennessee Titans showed us this in 2024 when they hired Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan. He had worked with a multitude of talented quarterbacks, including Peyton Manning and Joe Burrow in some aspects. And even though he was the offensive coordinator in Cincinnati, he did not call the plays. He did, however, put together the gameplans. While Callahan's involvement in the game plans and putting them together was paramount, it does not replace the feel that comes with calling plays. Knowing when and where to call different things in different situations is something that comes with experience in that position. While Callahan may have considered all scenarios when he was the offensive coordinator, that cannot replace the in-tune feeling for what situations call for at certain moments.\n\nWith Udinski, he is a coordinator who has not called plays in Jacksonville. He is surely a part of the braintrust regarding the Jacksonville offense that has helped make Trevor Lawrence an MVP Finalist this year. But when you move over a seat from the assistant to the head coach, things get a little different, as Brian Callahan can attest to. Combine that lack of play-calling experience with the pressure cooker that is the Buffalo Bills' job right now, and Udinski would be entering a situation that could put pressure on him he may not be ready to handle. And in that case, it could ultimately lead to him having a quicker exit than he would want there. Overall, while he is being considered for the job, he may not be the right man for the job at this time and may need more room to grow.\n\nCalling plays does not seem like a big deal to many on the outside looking in, but it is something prospective head coaches need to do the majority of the time. While Udinski is a candidate in Buffalo and is hailed as an ascending coach, the fact of the matter is that he may do best by gaining that play-calling experience before becoming a head coach for longevity’s sake.",

    "fullText": "With only a few weeks left of NFL games until August, it’s time to take a look ahead to the teams that underachieved this season but are set up to take big steps forward next season. These five teams are all more talented than their records this past season indicated, and here is why they will all bounce back and improve next season.\n\nThe Giants have some big names on their defensive front and also have one of the league’s most exciting young quarterbacks in Jaxson Dart. When you add a brand new Super Bowl-winning head coach to the mix in John Harbaugh, things immediately improve.\n\nThe Giants future success goes way beyond that, though. The return of Malik Nabers will have a massive impact on this offense, as will the return of running back Cam Skateboo. The Giants should also be able to improve in the draft and via free agency, setting them up for what should be a much better 2026/2027 season.\n\nIf not for Joe Burrow missing most of the season, the Bengals could have easily won the weak AFC North division. Burrow is arguably a top-three quarterback in the NFL, and when he did suit up this season, the Bengals offense was one of the best in the league.\n\nExpect them to make improvements to their defense through the draft and be a much more competitive team next season. One thing they will need to address as well is their offensive line, so that they can protect Joe Burrow better and keep him healthy.\n\nThe Falcons were exciting early on this season, and they played great football to end the season as well. They have a very exciting offense that is loaded with star players, and the return of Michael Penix Jr. should only improve their chances.\n\nThey hired Kevin Stefanski as their new head coach, who should be a great fit for them, and also give Stefanski a chance to prove what he can do with a talented offense, something he was never given in Cleveland. The Falcons defense was much improved last season and should only continue to improve heading into next season.\n\nThe Vikings got off to a horrible start this season and dug themselves such a deep hole that they couldn’t climb out of. Based on how well they finished the season, though, there is hope that they can get back to being a playoff team in the NFC next season.\n\nThey have a very talented defense, one of the best offensive minds at head coach, and one of the best wide receivers in the league as well. Keeping JJ McCarthy healthy will be very important, but the Vikings could also look to bring in a veteran quarterback to not only push McCarthy but also as insurance in the event that McCarthy gets hurt again or just doesn’t perform well enough.\n\nThe Ravens entered this season as one of the Super Bowl favorites and ended up being the most disappointing team in the league. Lamar Jackson couldn’t stay healthy, the defense struggled for most of the season, and the wide receiving corps underwhelmed.\n\nThey moved on from John Harbaugh this offseason and hired Jesse Minter, who was one of the hottest names on the market. Bringing in a great offensive coordinator to work with the multiple-time MVP award winner, Lamar Jackson, is the team’s next mission. Keeping Jackson healthy, adding another big WR weapon, and getting some fresh blood on the sidelines coaching should lead to a much more successful 2026/2027 season.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post 5 NFL teams who will take a big step forward next season  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "A new season in football's National League begins this weekend as the chasing pack seek to make ground on all-conquering Kerry. The Kingdom are the team to beat going into 2026, but there is plenty to play for this season across the divisions with promotion and relegation potentially season-defining. Former Donegal star Brendan Devenney runs his eye over what may lie ahead in year two of Gaelic football's new rules.\n\nI covered last year's league final between Kerry and Mayo which was a poor enough affair.\n\nYou could see nobody was that worried, but what Jack O'Connor does is win the league which is a precursor to the championship.\n\nThey had a couple of rocky games after that with Cork putting it up to them [in Munster] and Meath got to them [in the championship] so we didn't see them as the finished article until they got to the All-Ireland final when they were on another level and reaching those heights again will make them very hard to stop.\n\nIn terms of the game itself, I think a big focus this year will be on scoring and preventing the two-pointers, while winning around the middle on kick-outs will be crucial.\n\nIf teams put a full squeeze on from the kick-out, the majority will be long and if you have big, physical men around the middle, that will be a huge asset.\n\nDefensively, you just can't lie in and shut the game down now because you can be picked off with two-pointers or if you move out, you can be hit with a ball over the top.\n\nAfter a period to fully figure out their approach, this weekend will be interesting to see how teams have adapted.",

    "description": "Jason Williams inbox: Baltimore and Buffalo fired highly successful coaches. Does it make Bengals look worse for sticking with Zac Taylor?",
    "fullText": "Ask columnist Jason Williams anything − sports or non-sports – and he’ll pick some of your questions and comments from his inbox and respond on Cincinnati.com. Email: jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nMessage: John Harbaugh won a Super Bowl in Baltimore. He won eight road playoff games over 18 seasons there, something no other coach has done. He still got fired.\n\nSean McDermott made Buffalo a regular contender in the AFC, at one point going six straight seasons of winning at least one playoff game. He still got fired.\n\nAnd yet Zac Taylor remains the Bengals’ head coach after missing the playoffs three straight years. Don’t you think all these firings of top coaches makes the Bengals look even worse for keeping Zac?\n\nReply: Guess it depends on the audience. It looks bad to the national media, which can’t accept that the Bengals aren’t like everyone else in how they operate. Here at home, we’re conditioned to accept Bengals mediocrity and so most people don’t think it looks all that bad.\n\nBig picture, the moves in Baltimore and Buffalo highlight that the Bengals’ standards aren’t congruent with the AFC’s elite franchises. You already knew that, but it’s just another reminder that some teams have a whole other level of expectations – a level that’s hard to comprehend around here.\n\nBaltimore and Buffalo are legitimately trying to win a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Bengals ownership is happy if the team is competitive and finishes with a winning record. Did you notice that Bengals owner Mike Brown pointed out the “four straight winning seasons” in the first sentence of his statement early this month? Well, two of those ended with no playoff berth.\n\nThat said, I’m glad Taylor didn’t get fired. The team’s failures aren’t his fault. Taylor can only do so much with the inadequate players that ownership and the front office keep giving him.\n\nAnd there is something to be said about being patient with a coach. It’s a tough balancing act, but Taylor did oversee the best two-year stretch in team history – and it wasn’t that long ago.\n\nThe notion of firing a coach after one bad season is crazy, like the Ravens did with Harbaugh. On one hand, you like the message that mediocrity won’t cut it. On the other, though, it’s a cautionary tale to be careful what you wish for. It’ll be incredibly difficult for new Baltimore coach Jesse Minter to match Harbaugh’s success, let alone top it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Baltimore, Buffalo go for Super Bowl excellence as Bengals stay same",

Maye completed 33 of his first 56 passes for 447 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 76 rushing yards on 14 carries.\n\nIf Maye takes better care of the football on Sunday and his offensive line holds up, Maye will have no issue putting an exclamation point on his case for NFL MVP.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: Drake Maye tabbed a finalist for 2025 AP NFL MVP award",

    "description": "A look at 20 free agents who have played for a defense with Parker as a coach, and how each performed in 2025.",
    "fullText": "One of the oldest tenets in the NFL is that players tend to follow the coaches who have had positive impacts on their development. With Christian Parker in line to become the next Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, and with his glowing reputation as a teacher and tactician, it is fair to wonder which former players could be joining him in Dallas.\n\nFans know, the club is in dire need of additional defensive talent. And while Parker is moving up to playcaller for the first time in his career, his relationships with players doesn't necessarily have to be limited to secondary players just because he was the defensive passing game coordinator. There could absolutely be linebackers who have been involved in those meetings who are interested in working for the 34-year old under the bright lights in Dallas.\n\nThe first glimpse is to who are pending free agents within the Philadelphia Eagles organization but things don't stop there. Parker also coached with the Denver Broncos from 2021 through 2023, and players from that era could still easily be able to contribute in 2026.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, the players who likely have most benefitted from Parker's tutelage are either still under their rookie deals with the Eagles, or have signed on long-term with their team.\n\nPatrick Surtain II: First-team All-Pro\nQuinyon Mitchell: First-team All-Pro\nCooper DeJean: First-team All-Pro\n\n... and all before Christian Parker turns 35. \n\nwelcome to the #Cowboys, sir. https://t.co/vmUEdicnZM\n\n— Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) January 22, 2026\n\nHere's a rundown of the top potential free agents who could now be in the mix in Dallas, tiered by their 2025 Pro Football Focus overall defensive grades.\n\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian (RFA), Denver, 2022-23, 80.3 grade in 2025\n\nMcMillian is a former UDFA who has been a staple in the Denver secondary. They will most likely slap him with a 1st round or 2nd round tender, taking him off the market.\n\nSafety Avonte Maddox, Detroit, 2024, 79.1 grade in 2025\n\nMaddox had an incredible single season in Detroit, but didn't fare as well in Philly. He had a 61.9 overall grade in his one season working with Parker.\n\nSafety CJ Gardner-Johnson, Philadelphia, 2024, 51.4 grade in 2025\n\nNot a great year for Gardner-Johnson in Chicago, but he did have a 77.0 grade w/ Parker in 2024.\n\nLB Justin Strnad, Denver, 2021-23, 72.1 grade in 2025\n\nStrnad barely played while Parker was in Denver, but that doesn't mean they didn't have a chance to form some level of working relationship. Now that he's getting, he's an intriguing option for the Cowboys to fill out their linebacker core with.\n\nCB Fabian Moreau, Minnesota, 2023, 71.4\n\nMoreau has a strong grade, but only played 198 snaps in 2025 as a reserve. Could definitely be added as a depth piece to help round out the roster if Parker liked what he saw their one year together in 2023; Moreau graded out at 62.4 on 739 snaps.\n\nLB Alex Singleton, Denver, 2022-23, 70.1\n\nSingle had a strong first year in Denver with Parker in 2022, his highest graded of his six seasons at 79.1.\n\nSafety PJ Locke, Denver, 2021-23, 63.0\n\nNothing much stands out with Locke, who has mostly been a reserve, but he did have 3 sacks on 11 pash rush snaps in 2023 with Parker.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 62.2\n\nDean has generally been regarded as a bust with the Eagles, but when he got starter snaps through the year in 2024 with Parker, he had a 77.4 grade, including a strong year in both run defense and pass rush.\n\nThose aren't the only back-seven players who are on the free agent market this year, but they are the ones who turned in average-or-better performances. Here's a look at other free agent linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties with ties to Parker.\n\nCB Adoree' Jackson, Philadelphia, 2025, 53.6 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Marcus Epps, Philadelphia, 2025, 51.8 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 42.6 grade in 2025\n\nLB Ben Van Sumeren (RFA), Philadelphia, 2024-25, N/A\n\nLB Josey Jewell, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Justin Simmons, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Kareem Jackson, Out of the League, 2021-22\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",

    "fullText": "With Super Bowl LX nearly two weeks away, five finalists have been announced for the 2025 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nAfter a campaign in which Christian McCaffrey suited up for every game and posted a career-high 413 touches from scrimmage, the San Francisco 49ers running back is a heavy favorite to comeaway with the award.\n\nHere are the latest NFL odds ahead of the annual NFL Honors ceremony, scheduled for February 5 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco.\n\n• Over the last seven years, the NFL CPOY Award has been handed out to a quarterback.\n\n• From 2014 to 2018, every Comeback Player of the Year had suffered a season-ending injury during the previous year, and Alex Smith won in 2020 after recovering from a devastating leg injury that almost required amputation.\n\n• Joe Burrow joins Chad Pennington (2006 and 2008) as the only player to win this award twice.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when wagering on NFL awards betting odds.\n\nSportsbooks will adjust NFL awards odds as the season goes on. In the preseason and the early weeks of the regular season, betting on dark horses can prove very profitable. As the season continues, expect to see odds tighten around the favorites. At that point, it becomes wise to focus on the players near the top of the odds board, and betting big underdogs is unwise.\n\nLive long shots can provide tremendous value. Look at younger players on the verge of breaking out, or guys that have already been playing at a high level but could take the next step now that they are in an ideal situation with a new team, coach, or system. Other players that can give a great payout are established stars coming off underperforming seasons due to injuries or other factors.\n\nWhen placing futures bets on individual awards, keep in mind that voters, not a scoreboard, are often the deciding factor. Voters can be influenced by a variety of factors, including media coverage and public opinion. Consider what the media narrative is for a particular season and which players they seem to be rooting for and against.\n\nHistorical trends, especially recent ones, can give you a good idea of which way voters tend to lean. For example, the NFL MVP has been handed out to a quarterback in 14 of the last 15 seasons. Identifying those trends is a good way to separate the true contenders from the pretenders.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Jarrett Stidham has started four games in his NFL career and all of them came at the end of losing seasons, so he has no experience with what he's going to experience this weekend.\n\nBo Nix's fractured ankle has thrust Stidham into the starting quarterback spot for the Broncos in this Sunday's AFC Championship Game against the Patriots. The implications of the game for both the Broncos and Stidham are clear.\n\nA win would send the Broncos to the Super Bowl and it would take Stidham from unheralded backup to a household name overnight. On Wednesday, Stidham said he knows this is \"not about myself\" but how he can \"help my teammates succeed on Sunday.\" He said the approach to doing that is by keeping things as routine as possible despite the unusual circumstances.\n\n\"I think what I always go back to — in any game, regular season, preseason, the AFC Championship — it's still the same game,\" Stidham said, via the team's website. \"Obviously, there are implications and winner advances, all that kind of stuff, but at the end of the day, it's still football. That's how I view it. I'm not treating it any differently. I'm not treating my preparation any differently. I'm just going to go out there and play and be myself. I think that's the biggest thing. I'm not going to try to be somebody that I'm not. I know how I can play, and I know the kind of guys I have around me and the kind of team that we have. So, we all just have to play within ourselves.\"\n\nBroncos teammates and head coach Sean Payton have expressed confidence in Stidham's ability to handle being thrown into the fire in a do-or-die situation, but one look at the odds shows how much doubt exists outside of the organization. Stidham won't be able to quiet that before Sunday, so it is something else to ignore as he prepares for the biggest moment of his professional career.",

    "description": "Ohio State wide receiver Carnell Tate was predicted to be drafted into a good situation in NFL, per ESPN's Mel Kiper.",
    "fullText": "Ohio State wide receiver Carnell Tate shouldn't have to wait long to hear his name on draft night.\n\nTate recorded 51 catches for 875 yards and nine touchdowns on the Buckeyes, helping the program make it to the College Football Playoff quarterfinal.\n\nESPN's Mel Kiper is projecting Tate to be a top-five draft pick. Most players drafted that early go to teams with bad situations.\n\nHowever, Tate might have luck in store for him in his rookie season.\n\nKiper thinks the New York Giants will take Tate with the No. 5 pick. Tate would be an intriguing addition to an offense that already boasts a star receiver in Malik Nabers, and those two could cause matchup nightmares for opposing defenses.\n\n\"The Giants have a lot of needs, but similar to Tennessee, they have a second-year quarterback looking for help,\" Kiper wrote. \"Yes, wide receiver Malik Nabers (knee) and running back Cam Skattebo (ankle/leg) will be back on the field, but wideout Wan'Dale Robinson is a free agent, and Nabers can't be the target on all of Jaxson Dart's throws.\n\n\"Taking a first-round wide receiver wouldn't be new to recently hired coach John Harbaugh; in Baltimore, he used four Day 1 picks starting in 2015 on the position (Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman, Hollywood Brown and Breshad Perriman).\"\n\nThe Giants went all-in for former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh. With Tate, New York's offense could be a threat to go along with a defense that should improve in 2026 under Harbaugh.\n\nHarbaugh took the job with the Giants in part because he believes Dart can be an elite passer in the league.\n\n\"It starts with the quarterback for sure,\" Harbaugh said, via the Giants' website. \"You build your team around your quarterback. You build your team around your players and what they do well. I like the way (Dart) plays.\n\n\"I like his talent, skill set, all the things he's accomplished, but more than that, I like who he is and what he's about. To me, he's about football. This young guy loves football. He wants to talk football all the time and that's kind of what I like doing too.\"\n\nTate would certainly help accelerate Dart's development.\n\nIf Tate goes at No. 5, he'd join Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka as former Buckeyes to go in the first round.\n\nThose players are making big impacts on their respective teams.",

His path took him from Washington to Colorado in 2023, following opportunity, belief, and the promise of a fresh start under Deion Sanders.\n\nInstead, the game nearly took his life.\n\nIn a deeply personal message shared publicly, Smalls revealed that he has medically retired from college football after learning he was born with spinal stenosis, a condition that dangerously narrows the spinal canal.

That absence is notable, especially in a sport where public thanks are often extended even in far less personal moments.\n\nOnce viewed as an immediate impact defender and a future NFL prospect, Smalls exited the game quietly. There was no press conference. No farewell moment. No orchestrated goodbye.

The Colts and the Irsay family are grateful to the NFL for their continued confidence in our city's ability.\"\n\nThe NFL has discussed moving around the NFL's biggest pre-draft event, as it does with the draft and the Super Bowl, and has even solicited bids from other cities. Indianapolis' unique setup, though, allows for maximum efficiency and accessibility.\n\n\"Indianapolis and the NFL Combine have built a proud legacy together, and we're pleased to extend our partnership with Visit Indy, the Colts and the local community,\" said Peter O'Reilly, the NFL's executive vice president, club business, international and league events. \"For over three decades, Indy has delivered an exceptional environment for our football evaluation operations, and we're excited to continue improving the prospect and club experience while enhancing the fan moments that create opportunities for tens of thousands to engage with the league's future stars.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals, after a disappointing 2025 campaign marred by injuries to two of the team's biggest stars on both sides of the ball, need to bounce back in a major way next season.\n\nWhile the 6-11 record stings, it did allow the Bengals to land the 10th overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. With that top-10 pick, the Bengals need to land an instant-impact player.\n\nESPN writer Ben Baby is urging the Bengals to take a playmaker at this spot, and one that would make team history for the first time since 2010, over 15 years ago.\n\n\"The Bengals haven't used a top-10 pick on defense since 2010, when they drafted linebacker Keith Rivers with the No. 9 pick. But they can't afford to follow history this time,\" Baby writes. \"The team needs playmakers on defense.\"\n\nCincinnati has a star-studded offense, with Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, and Chase Brown being more than enough to contend.\n\nOffensively, the team isn't lacking playmakers. But the same cannot be said for the defensive side of the ball. The Bengals need to add to their defense, whether it's a pass rusher or a defensive back; defense is a must this offseason.\n\nMore: Two reasons why Bengals fans should look forward to defense in 2026\n\nSomeone like Ohio State's Caleb Downs would be an incredible addition. While a safety might not be a popular pick, it would be a worthwhile one for a Bengals defense in need of all-around upgrades on that side of the ball.\n\nBaby is calling on the Bengals to add a defensive playmaker in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft, and it's not hard to understand. The defense needs to get better, and the Bengals' best option in the draft will likely be a defensive player.\n\nIt's a logical decision, and one that the Bengals front office, led by Duke Tobin, should strong considering making. The Bengals should make some franchise history by taking a defensive player inside the top-10 for the first time since 2010.\n\nBengals' Chase Brown believes average fan can gain one yard in an NFL game\n\nBengals receive $33 million contract projection on Trey Hendrickson despite injury\n\nBengals announce Zac Taylor decision after rough 2025 season\n\nZac Taylor was mad for dumbest reason ever after Myles Garrett's record-breaking sack\n\nJa'Marr Chase says issues Bengals need to change are 'pretty obvious'\n\nBengals urged to make aggressive Chase Brown contract decision",

    "title": "Regarding 2026 Colts, one NFL exec makes somewhat surprising prediction",
    "description": "This latest NFL exec prediction for the Colts may surprise you entering the 2026 offseason.",
    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, one NFL executive made a surprising prediction regarding the 2026 Indianapolis Colts. Namely, that the Colts will win the division for the first time since 2014:\n\n“But they showed a proof of concept with what they had through 10 games,” an AFC executive said via Fowler. “They had Daniel Jones playing well. The roster has talent. They are closer than people might think.”\n\nProjected as a routine bottom feeder in NFL power rankings entering this past season, the Colts shockingly became one of the hottest teams football, once sitting at 8-2 atop the AFC, and featuring a historically elite league offense—where the fresh pairing of head coach Shane Steichen and newly signed starting quarterback Daniel Jones was paying off major dividends for Indianapolis.\n\nUnfortunately, thereafter, starting quarterback Jones suffered a fractured fibula, limiting his mobility and the dynamic Colts offensive attack, before ultimately suffering a season-ending torn Achilles in Week 14 at Jacksonville—presumably because of physical overcompensation for the earlier lower leg injury.\n\nThe Colts would end up losing 7 straight games to close out the season, as in Jones’ 4-game absence, the team desperately turned to 44-year-old, unretired veteran quarterback Philip Rivers, and then rookie Riley Leonard for the regular season finale, once the team was already eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nIt wasn’t just Jones though, as particularly on defense, the Colts sustained key injuries to the unit’s three best players: DeForest Buckner, Sauce Gardner, and Charvarius Ward. On offense, the team also lost starting veteran offensive tackle Braden Smith and even left tackle Bernhard Raimann for a short stint to close out 2025.\n\nIn theory, if the Colts can re-sign Jones, who’s a pending 2026 NFL free agent, and get some of those other returning standout players healthy, they could pick up right where they left off before injuries completely derailed what once was one of the best starts to an Indianapolis regular season in years.\n\nThat being said, Jones is coming off a torn Achilles, which can be a potentially career-altering injury, especially for a 28-year-old quarterback who relies a lot on his mobility, and particularly in head coach Shane Steichen’s offense and the versatile ground game with star workhorse Jonathan Taylor.\n\nHaving suffered the injury later in the season, it’s a fair question of whether Jones will be ready for the regular season opener, let alone training camp. Even if he does return in time to be ready for 2026, what physical condition will he realistically be in? His other NFL quarterback colleagues have not recently fared all that well coming back from similar injuries to-date. Will Jones be the exception? Will it take longer than a year to recover?\n\nSome of those other veteran players hoping to potentially return are defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck), cornerback Charvarius Ward (three concussions last year), and pending free agent offensive tackle Braden Smith (concussion/neck). All of whom are question marks to make a full recovery as well.\n\nDespite a stalwart defense under head coach DeMeco Ryans, the Texans appear rather one-dimensional with starting quarterback C.J. Stroud’s continued playoff struggles at the moment. However, the Jacksonville Jaguars may be the toast of the AFC South until proven otherwise—as the reigning AFC South Champions, and a rival just as complete and talented as Indianapolis when at full strength and truly going right.\n\nThe Jaguars have won 5 of the 6 matchups against the Colts under Steichen and remain the divisional rival to beat within the AFC South. They’re the best team within the division until proven otherwise.\n\nIt’s also not how you start, it’s how you finish. In contrast to the Colts disastrous losing skid, the Jaguars and Texans won 8 and 9 games in a row to close out the 2025 campaign respectively. This current Colts nucleus has routinely suffered late season collapses, and they’ll have to finally overcome that and complete the job in 2026.",

    "description": "Could the Miami Dolphins replace Tua Tagovailoa with Malik Willis this offseason?",
    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins officially have a new general manager and head coach for the first time in over a decade. Now, with the new era set to begin, the duo must find a way to improve a position that has plagued the Dolphins since the day Dan Marino retired.\n\nTua Tagovailoa showed flashes, but his day as the Dolphins’ starting quarterback is over, with reports surfacing that the team was ready to move on and find someone else to lead the new era of Miami football.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s NFL Insider, Jeremy Fowler, that player could be someone both Jon-Eric Sullivan and Jeff Hafley have familiarity with from the last few years in Green Bay.\n\nA player who just so happens to be a free agent this season.\n\n-Lamar Jackson to the Raiders\n-A.J. Brown to the Bills\n-Malik Willis to Dolphins or Browns\n-Kyler or Geno to New York\n\nExecs/scouts/coaches make bold predictions on 2026 offseasonhttps://t.co/vrn0rBuPCN\n\n— Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) January 20, 2026\n\nIn a recent ESPN article breaking down some of the off-season’s most probable trades and signings, Fowler suggests that Sullivan and Hafley could bring in a quarterback whom they saw first-hand take over when Jordan Love went down. And to be quite honest, he played some pretty damn good football.\n\nSo much so that it won’t be just the Dolphins jockeying for his services. As Fowler writes, if Daniel Jones returns to Indianapolis, there’s a very good chance that Willis could be the top quarterback on the market. (He probably still is even if Jones does hit the open market, but that’s a conversation for another day)\n\nAnother team that league executives believe could be interested in Willis is the Cleveland Browns.\n\n“I just don’t think [the Browns] go into the season with Shedeur [Sanders] as their top option,” an NFC personnel man said. “And getting the right quarterback in the draft isn’t a guarantee based on where they pick.”\n\nCleveland has two first-round picks, but with Oregon’s Dante Moore returning to school and other key factors, Willis could be their best bet for adding legit competition to a room that has Shedeur Sanders and Dillion Gabriel currently battling for the QB1 spot.\n\nBut as Fowler says, Miami will have a better beat on Willis and his potential over any other team.\n\n“No regime will know Willis’ strengths better than Miami, which just hired a brain trust of GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and head coach Jeff Hafley from Green Bay. The Packers valued Willis’ development and Miami could bear the fruits of that labor.”\n\nI know this is giving some of us older folks a bit of ‘déjà vu’ as it feels eerily similar to the days of Joe Philbin and everyone wanting Matt Flynn, because we were QB-starved and unquestioningly believed things might be different.\n\nBut Willis has legit tools (I’ll do a breakdown in the coming weeks) and could be the perfect QB to help usher in this new era of Dolphins football, while allowing Sullivan and Hafley to find the future in the 2027 or 2028 draft class.\n\nMalik Willis pic.twitter.com/iV0XCHJNZl\n\n— Ian Hartitz (@Ihartitz) January 14, 2026\n\nLast season in Green Bay, Willis completed 85.7 % of his passes for 422 yards and 3 touchdowns in four appearances (1 start). In total, the former third-round pick of the 2022 NFL Draft (86th overall) has started six games, finishing with a 3-3 record.\n\nThe cap situation is bleak, and the Dolphins have to find a suitor for Tua. But if Brandon Shore and Sullivan can find a way to make it work, I think Miami fans would be delighted to have a player like Malik Willis behind center.\n\nThen again, all of this sounds too good to be true.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Miami Dolphins signing free agent quarterback Malik Willis this offseason? Do you think he’d be the perfect fit for this next era of Dolphins football? How do you feel saying goodbye to Tua Tagovailoa after what appeared to be a promising start to the McDaniel era? Are you happy with the head coach/GM duo Miami now has? Let us know in the comments section below!",

    "description": "The 4 teams still alive combined for just 14 losses all season.",
    "fullText": "Conference championship weekend includes three teams that went 14-3 in the regular season and also the Los Angeles Rams, who some consider the best team in the NFL.\n\nOf course, there’s an asterisk. One of those 14-3 teams, the Denver Broncos, had the gut punch of finding out Bo Nix will miss the rest of the playoffs due to a broken bone in his ankle. That changed the playoff landscape, and also the betting odds for the conference championship round.\n\nHere are three betting storylines for the NFL’s final four, with odds from BetMGM:\n\nIt’s impossible to discuss the AFC championship game without a dive into the Broncos’ quarterback conundrum.\n\nBroncos coach Sean Payton shocked everyone with the announcement that Bo Nix would undergo season-ending surgery, meaning Jarrett Stidham would start the AFC championship game. Stidham will set the record for fewest career starts (four) of any starting quarterback in NFL conference championship game history.\n\nThere was a huge adjustment to the line. On lookahead lines for potential matchups last week, the Broncos were a 1.5-point favorite over the Patriots. That moved all the way to Patriots -5.5, but it has come back to Patriots -5 at BetMGM. The Broncos could close as the biggest home underdog in NFL conference championship game history.\n\nBefore the season, 12 oddsmakers broke down the point-spread difference between starting quarterback and backup quarterback for each team to Yahoo Sports’ Ben Fawkes, and the average difference from Nix and Stidham was 3.85 points. The line actually moved 6.5 points, based on that lookahead line, which seems like an overreaction.\n\nThe NFC championship game is the third meeting between the Seahawks and Rams this season, which means we have point spread history for two other games.\n\nIn the first meeting in Los Angeles, the Rams were 3-point favorites and won but didn’t cover, outlasting Seattle 21-19 when the Seahawks missed a long field goal as time expired. In the second game, the Seahawks were 1.5-point favorites and trailed by 16 points in the fourth quarter before coming back to win but not cover in a wild 38-37 win.\n\nThe line this time has moved the Seahawks’ way, even though their win over the Rams was fluky with a historic comeback. Seattle is -2.5 at -120 odds, which means it could move to Seahawks -3 before kickoff. The Seahawks’ rest over the last two weeks, with a bye followed by a blowout win over the 49ers, might factor in. The Rams’ wild-card game came down to the final minute and then the divisional round game at Chicago went to overtime. The Seahawks have also looked impressive in the three games since that comeback over the Rams, while Los Angeles hasn’t played a great game since then.\n\nBoth of these teams have been good to bettors. The Seahawks and Rams both went 12-5 against the spread this regular season, in a four-way tie for the best ATS record in the NFL according to Action Network (the Patriots and Jaguars were the others).\n\nAs has been the case for weeks, the two NFC West teams are atop the Super Bowl odds. No matter which NFC team wins Sunday, they’re very likely to be favored in Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe Broncos’ quarterback situation has also affected the current Super Bowl odds:\n\nIt is a bit jarring to see Jarrett Stidham at +2000 to win Super Bowl MVP, considering he hasn’t thrown a pass in either of the last two regular seasons and wasn’t on anyone’s radar just a few days ago.",

    "fullText": "Joe Burrow woke up from a social media slumber on Monday to weigh in on a pair of calls that sparked controversy in this weekend's divisional round playoff games.\n\nAs far as he's concerned, there is no controversy.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals quarterback tweeted a defense of game officials for their rulings on \"two plays\" that he declared \"were not difficult calls.\"\n\nHe mentions two plays \"yesterday,\" but is almost certainly referencing a late interception on a contested ball in the Broncos' divisional round playoff win over the Bills on Saturday and another play on a contested ball Sunday that was ruled a catch for Los Angeles receiver Davante Adams in the Rams' win over the Bears.\n\n\"The amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me,\" Burrow wrote. \"And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.\"\n\nThe amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me. And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.\n\n— Joey Burrow (@JoeyB) January 19, 2026\n\nOther than a retweet of a Netflix post promoting a show about him, that was Burrow's first tweet since April 26, 2024. He apparently feels strongly about this.\n\nThe first play in question was Ja'Quan McMillian's interception of Josh Allen in overtime of Denver's 33-30 win Saturday night. Bills receiver Brandin Cooks secured the ball in his hands on a deep pass that would have set the Bills up in position for a game-winning field goal.\n\nCooks was diving to the ground as he made the catch and still had the ball in his hands when his knee hit the turf. But McMillian had tight coverage and snatched the ball from Cooks' grasp after they hit the ground. He stood up with possession of the ball, and officials awarded him an interception. Denver drove for the game-winning field goal on its ensuing drive.\n\nWOW!! Interception Josh Allen on this crazy play pic.twitter.com/J7UyosDna5\n\n— Rate the Refs (@Rate_the_Refs) January 18, 2026\n\nOn the second play in question, Adams caught a ball in traffic in a tie game in the fourth quarter of Sunday's Rams-Bears divisional matchup.\n\nHe didn't take a step after securing the ball and was immediately taken down to the turf by a pair of Bears defenders. As his knee hit the turf, Bears defensive back Tyrique Stevenson had his hand on the ball, which was still in Adams' grasp. Stevenson then stripped the ball from Adams before Adams fully hit the ground.\n\nHow is this a catch from Davante Adams but the Brandin Cooks play wasn’t?\n\n*Both plays are catches fyi #BillsMafia | #GoBills \n pic.twitter.com/UWz2dkuTqU\n\n— Peter DiBiasi (@DibiasiPeter) January 19, 2026\n\nOn this play, Adams was awarded a catch. The Rams went on to score a touchdown on the drive for a 17-10 lead en route to a 20-17 overtime win.\n\nNBC rules analyst Terry McAulay agreed with the call on the field on the broadcast. He also was watching Saturday night and tweeted his agreement of the call on McMillian's interception. Per McAulay, Adams made a football act \"common to the game\" on his play that was enough to rule it a complete catch before his knee hit the ground.\n\n\"He clearly completed the catch on this one,\" McAulay said. \"He has it long enough to perform an act common to the game, and then he goes to the ground, and his knee goes down prior to him losing control.\"\n\nIn the case of McMillian's interception, Cooks was diving to the ground and, per McAulay, didn't establish a completed catch before his knee hit the ground, allowing McMillian to strip the ball for the turnover.\n\n\"A player going to the ground to catch a pass must maintain control during and after contact with the ground,\" McAulay wrote. That's the rule. Apply accordingly.\"\n\nBurrow didn't go into further details beyond his initial tweet, but it's safe to assume that he agrees with McAulay's interpretation of the rules. And those were the same conclusions that officials on the field reached in both games.",

Following the Bills’ playoff loss to the Denver Broncos, Allen cried while addressing reporters, apologizing to his teammates and expressing disappointment over how the season concluded.\n\nThe Bills’ campaign came to an end on January 17, after a defeat to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round. Speaking at the post-game press conference, Josh Allen struggled to hold back tears as he addressed the result and his mindset following the loss. “It’s extremely difficult,” Allen said. He continued, “I feel like I let my teammates down tonight.”\n\nWhen asked why the defeat affected him so profoundly, Allen explained that the game featured several moments the team failed to capitalize on. He said there were “missed opportunities throughout the game,” before adding, “It’s been a long season. I hate how it ended, and that’s gonna stick with me for a long time.”\n\nJosh Allen also addressed what he told his teammates in the immediate aftermath of the loss, making it clear that emotions were still raw in the locker room. “I haven’t been doing a lot of talking,” Allen admitted. “I love my teammates, and I’m extremely sorry, and I’m extremely disappointed in how this ended,” he continued. The game itself ended in overtime, when Will Lutz converted a 24-yard field goal to secure the win for the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe press conference also came at a meaningful time in Allen’s personal life, as his wife, Hailee Steinfeld, is currently pregnant and expecting the couple’s first child.\n\nWith the victory, Denver advanced to the AFC Championship Game, where the top-seeded team will face either the New England Patriots or the Houston Texans on January 25.

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — Caleb Williams' last throw in regulation was a backpedaling, fourth-down rainbow that landed in Cole Kmet's hands in the corner of the end zone for a breathtaking touchdown.\n\nHis last throw of the game was the beginning of the end for Chicago's surprising season.\n\nWilliams almost rallied the Bears to another memorable win on Sunday night. But he threw his third interception in overtime and Matthew Stafford drove the Los Angeles Rams to Harrison Mevis' winning field goal in a 20-17 victory in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\n“It's tough. In these moments, you feel that you let your team down,” Williams said. “You feel this or that. It’s a good lesson learned for us, first time being in this situation for me and for us as a team. I’m excited for what’s to come. But obviously going to go back and watch this and figure out how I can be better, and that’s the exciting part.”\n\nThe 24-year-old Williams led Chicago to an NFL-record seven wins this season when trailing in last 2 minutes of regulation. He threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 left in a 31-27 victory over Green Bay in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThis time, the Bears (12-7) were losing 17-10 when they got the ball back with 1:50 left in the fourth quarter. And, just like before, Williams delivered.\n\nFacing a fourth-and-4 at the Rams 14 with 27 seconds left, Williams took a shotgun snap and surveyed the field. The No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft was forced to backpedal as the pocket collapsed, and he scampered all the way back to the 40 with Jared Verse, Josaiah Stewart and Braden Fiske all in pursuit for the Rams.\n\nWilliams turned, saw Kmet in the end zone and threw the ball in his direction just as Verse and Stewart got to the second-year QB.\n\n“I ended up getting a little bit of pressure, so try and break contain and just break angles and slow those guys down so that when I do turn around, I can have a little bit more time possibly to find somebody,” Williams said, “and they did a good job containing me, so I just gained a little bit more depth, and I saw Cole one-on-one over there.”\n\nKmet wrestled with Rams cornerback Cobie Turner before hauling in the pass, sending a charge through the crowd of 60,253 on a frigid night at Soldier Field.\n\n“It felt like a pretty easy pitch-and-catch and kind of felt like it was in slow motion,” Kmet said. “I can’t believe Caleb.”\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson called the throw “ridiculous.”\n\n“There’s some things that you just can’t coach. ... He’s got a knack, he’s clutch,” Johnson said.\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Williams' pass traveled 51.2 yards in the air for the longest completed pass by air distance in the red zone since at least 2016. He made the throw from 26.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage; no quarterback since 2016, according to Next Gen Stats, had completed a pass from a depth of more than 22 yards.\n\nIt had a completion probability of 17.8%.\n\n“It was the most special throw that I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen him do that so many times this year,” Bears safety Kevin Byard said.\n\nWilliams also threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Moore on fourth down on the first play of the second quarter. But his three interceptions were costly.\n\nThe Bears had a chance to win the game in overtime. They drove to the Los Angeles 48 before Williams was picked off by Rams safety Kam Curl on a deep ball intended for Moore.\n\n“Just a miscommunication between him and I,” Williams said. \"Tried to flatten him off under the safety, and he kept it vertical from what I saw, obviously, in the moment.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "Here's how the teams in the AFC and NFC title games stack up against each other.",
    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Three reasons Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will (and won't) win Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWho will win Super Bowl 60? The wide-open 2025-2026 NFL playoffs started with a combined 14 teams from the AFC and NFC, but it's down to four with the conference championship matchups now set for next Sunday.\n\nThe AFC has held form, with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos (14-3) ready to host the No. 2 seed New England Patriots (14-3). The best team in the NFC, the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks (14-3) will host the No. 5 Los Angeles Rams (12-5) in another NFC West rubber match.\n\nAny one of those teams can either win the Super Bowl or fall flat in the league semifinals. Based on each team's odds to finish the playoffs undefeated and raise the Lombardi Trophy, here's looking at why the Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will succeed or fail through the last two rounds:\n\n(Futures odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Seahawks led the NFL scoring defense (16.6 points allowed per game) and were third in total defense (282.8 yards per game) during the regular season. They were No. 2 against the run (92.6 yards per game) and No. 9 against the pass (190.3). They lived up to that reputation and then some in obliterating the 49ers in the divisional round of the playoffs, 41-6.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks smacked 49ers behind dominant defense\n\nThey are in sync with the pressure and coverage and just erased San Francisco's running game. Outside of some issues covering backs and tight ends, Seattle has no defensive weaknesses. They are starting to channel much of the classic \"Legion of Boom\" energy from their Super Bowl 48-winning team.\n\nThe Seahawks ran the ball on 50.6 percent of their offensive plays, No. 2 in the NFL behind only the Ravens. They were No. 7 in rushing yards per game, averaging 126.2 yards. With a blowout in the divisional round, Seattle rushed the ball at a 63.5 percent clip, producing 175 yards on 33 attempts, with Kenneth Walker III (116 yards, 3 TDs) carrying the load after Zach Charbonnet (knee) got hurt.\n\nWhen Seattle can run the ball at a high clip, it takes a lot of pressure off Sam Darnold in the passing game. With their offensive line getting great interior blocking, it's a tough rushing attack to stop.\n\nThe Seahawks' run blocking has been on point and Klint Kubiak has done well to keep the offense balanced so it maintains explosiveness, too.\n\nSam Darnold has responded in his reunion with Kubiak, playing well off the running game. It's wise to trust elite breakout wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba to make the big plays needed all the way through the end zone. Darnold has also hit on well-timed deep shots to other wideouts and made good use of his tight ends when called upon. Darnold has been fortunate to land in another QB-friendly system after his big season with Minnesota.\n\n1. Too little from the passing game\n\nDarnold is falling into the Trent Dilfer-Brad Johnson category of potential Super Bowl quarterbacks. He is more of a complementary strong supporter on a team led by defense and the running game. However, Darnold should be prepared to try to win another shootout in Seattle with Matthew Stafford after not needing to much to beat the 49ers.\n\nFor such a dominant team, the Seahawks were minus-3 in turnover margin during the regular season. They were second in the NFL with their 28 giveaways and Darnold threw 14 of Seattle's 15 interceptions. Although they crushed the 49ers in the turnover battle, 3-0, to reverse that trend, the Rams will be out looking for mistakes from Darnold.\n\nThe Seahawks were a middle of the pack offense on third down this season, converting on 39.8 percent of third-down chances. Seattle's third down struggles were highlighted in the divisional round, going 4-for-10 (40 percent) in the playoff rout of the 49ers. The Seahawks will need do better at sustaining drives or meet a playoff exit.\n\nThe Patriots' secondary was active and a big reason why they thwarted the Texans' makeshift receiving corps. C.J. Stroud saw some pressure, but his bad passes cost him because New England was opportunistic. New England also was all over ripping into Justin Herbert and his receivers in the wild-card round. The defense, not the offense, is why the Patriots remain alive, one game away from the Super Bowl.\n\nMaye got out of some his early playoff jitters and kinks against the Texans and Chargers, facing a lot more pressure in two senses and being less accurate and careful with the ball. But after a hot finish vs. Houston's brutal all-around defensive test with little help from the traditional running game, Maye should have a lot more confidence he can do what Josh Allen did in Denver to the Broncos' defense, only minus the turnovers.\n\nMORE: Why Patriots won't get away with sloppy Drake Maye vs. Bo Nix-less Broncos\n\nMike Vrabel and Josh McDaniels have proved to be strong Belichickian proxies for New England with Maye and the young defensive talent making their jobs much easier to execute at a high level. Vrabel has wasted no time returning to the ranks off top NFL coaches, picking up where left off with lesser teams in Tennessee.\n\nMaye has gotten sloppy with his ball security when running or keeping pass plays alive in the pocket. He has also thrown an interception in each of his first two playoff games, and luckily hasn't been picked off more with some anomalous inaccuracy. The Patriots must win the turnover battle all-around to win the war.\n\nMORE: Texans can't take advantage of Drake Maye's turnover troubles\n\nMaye is in Year 2. Everyone's adjusting to the Vrabel-McDaniels era after one bad transitional year with Jerod Mayo. There is some youth serving well on the defense despite its green nature. The Patriots are a facing a tight-nit Broncos' defense and would get either the swarming Seahawks or the savvier Sean McVay-led Rams in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots tend to give up touchdowns deep when their opponents can sustain long drives. They made the Texans look better in this major area of struggle on Sunday. Not holding for field goals on a couple drives can make the biggest difference for Maye and the offense moving forward.\n\nMcVay is the best coach in the NFL, considering his offensive play-calling acumen, motivational skills and situational understanding. He took advantage of a flawed field to push the team toward its first championship under him in Super Bowl 56. His offensive staff and defensive coordinator Chris Shula crush it every week, too.\n\nMORE: Why Sean McVay-Ben Johnson postgame handshake was cordial\n\n2. Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Davante Adams\n\nStafford might have more chemistry with Nacua and Adams than he did with Cooper Kupp and his other receivers four years ago. Nacua is off to a historic start with his production and Adams' red zone dominance has further stamped his Hall of Fame career. Stafford has been on point getting them the ball and it's also opened up big plays downfield and after the catch for the tight ends and other receivers.\n\n3. A strong defensive front seven\n\nThe back end of the Rams' defense has had some coverage breakdowns at corner and safety, exploitable in several matchups. The Rams won their last Super Bowl with Aaron Donald as the linchpin and Jalen Ramsey as the mercenary. Now they've a rebuilt a stout disruptive corps with Jared Verse, Kobie Turner, Braden Fiske, Nate Landman and other active youngsters.\n\n1. Not running the ball enough or effectively\n\nThe Rams have a good rushing attack, especially in short yardage and in the red zone. They stuck with the run 31 times against the Bears, with Kyren Williams scoring both of their TDs. But they averaged only 3.6 yards a carry and couldn't put the game away with the rushing attack in the fourth quarter. They can't get afford to get stuck being too one-dimensional for Stafford's sake.\n\nThe Rams made some huge interceptions against Caleb Williams to help survive in the divisional round. But they also had some major coverage breakdowns and benefitted from a few just-missed connections and drops by the Bears receivers.\n\nMcVay tends to be old-school for still being a young hotshot calling the offensive shots at age 39. For example, he could have trusted Stafford and the passing game to run out the clock with one more first down in regulation, but invited the Bears back in with a late short punt. Some tougher fourth-down calls might be required to outlast the Seahawks plus either the Patriots or Broncos.\n\nSean Payton and defensive coordinator Vance Joseph have been on point, coaching complementary football. Payton has the experience of winning Super Bowl 44 while leading the Saints and will extract the most out of his now more injury-riddled roster one last time. That includes scheming to make backup Jarrett Stidham semi-successful filling in for Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos dodged a bullet with cornerback Patrick Surtain returning vs. the Bills. They also saw more playmakers come though in the secondary behind good pressure on Allen, led by Ja'Quan McMillan in the slot corner role. Nik Bonitto and others set Denver up for success against the Bills and should be ready to tee off against Drake Maye and the Patriots.\n\nWith Nix out for the season with a broken bone in his ankle, his early legacy of being a clutch late-game quarterback may rub off with the whole team. Expect Denver to rally around Stidham to come through in the end.\n\n1. No Bo Nix and more offensive injuries\n\nStidham will likely need to go to work minus wide receivers Pat Bryant and Troy Franklin, just as the young targets were starting to come through for Nix. Now Stidham is dealing with a short-handed receiving corps on top of being rusty and jittery playing against his first NFL team at home.\n\nMORE:Why Nick Foles thinks Broncos have a chance after Bo Nix injury\n\nThe Broncos didn't find a reliable rushing attack even against the Bills' porous run defense, with Nix's scrambling leading the way in the running game. The team misses the power and juice of JK Dobbins with rookie RJ Harvey providing only some flashes without power-running substance. If the Broncos can't take pressure off Stidham with the running game vs. a nasty Patriots run defense, Stidham should be prepared to see a lot of heat in his face.\n\nSurtain and McMillan saved the day in many ways against the Bills, but the Broncos are not known for making big plays on the ball with only 10 interceptions and four fumble recoveries from the regular season. They need to be sound fundamentally for Vance Joseph and win the situational battles on third down and in the red zone. Any little crack in coverage and Maye will exploit it for chunk passes downfield with his fearless, big arm.",

    "fullText": "NFL playoff picks, predictions: Patriots hold off Broncos, Rams upset Seahawks to advance to Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nConference championship weekend will determine who reaches Super Bowl 60 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8.\n\nDenver and Seattle advanced on divisional playoff weekend.\n\nThe Broncos will host the AFC championship game for the seventh time in franchise history, but the dominant storyline is the loss of Bo Nix, who suffered a broken bone in his right ankle in the 33-30 victory against Buffalo and will be replaced by Jarrett Stidham. New England beat Houston 28-16 in the AFC divisional playoffs behind second-year quarterback Drake Maye and a defense that forced four turnovers.\n\nDenver has beaten the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game in two past meetings.\n\nThe AFC championship game will be at 3 p.m. on CBS.\n\nThe Seahawks hammered the San Francisco 49ers 49-6 in the NFC divisional playoffs. Sam Darnold earned his first playoff victory, and Kenneth Walker III had three TD runs. The Rams survived a 20-17 overtime classic at Chicago in the NFC divisional round, and Matthew Stafford has a chance to get to a second Super Bowl with coach Sean McVay, who is looking for a third appearance.\n\nHere are Sporting News' picks for the AFC and NFC Championship games (odds courtesy of Caesars):\n\nNew England Patriots (-5.5) at Denver Broncos\n\nIt is a fun coaching matchup between Sean Payton and Mike Vrabel, who can take New England to the Super Bowl in his first season.\n\nStidham made two starts with coach Sean Payton in the 2023 season. How much will the Patriots speed up the seventh-year quarterback on his reads? Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions and took three sacks. The Broncos will have to rely on the running game more – which averaged just 3.2 yards per carry against the Bills. RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin need to be more effective against a Patriots’ defense that allowed 48 rushing yards against the Texans. New England’s defense that features linebackers Robert Spillane and Christian Elliss.\n\nHow much will Stidham be able to test New England in the passing game? Carlton Davis - who did not have an interception in the regular season – had two picks. The Patriots will take chances in coverage on Stidham, and Denver also has uncertainty at the receiver position. Troy Franklin suffered a hamstring injury in the divisional playoffs, and that leaves Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims and Lil’Jordan Humphrey at receiver. How much success will the Broncos have on third down in the intermediate range?\n\nBreaking down Broncos' QB depth chart behind Bo Nix\n\nCan the Broncos still win the Super Bowl without Bo Nix?\n\nGet to know new Broncos QB1, Jarrett Stidham\n\nDenver’s defense also will face more pressure to keep this a low-scoring game. Maye will be on the spot, too, especially in his first road playoff start. The Broncos generated five turnovers and three sacks against the Bills, and linebacker Nik Bonitto had a sack and two forced fumbles. There will be opportunities against Maye, who had four fumbles against the Texans, and the pressure has to land. The Patriots can lean on the running game with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, and that should help Maye settle in on the road.\n\nMaye has been trustworthy on the road this season, too. He’s 8-0 with an average 273.5 yards, 17 TDs and three interceptions on the road this season. This is Maye’s first start at Empower Field at Mile High, and the Broncos were 9-1 S/U at home this season and 2-0 S/U as a home underdog. It’s still a tough environment, and the Broncos are 6-1 S/U all time at home in the AFC championship game. Pittsburgh beat Denver 34-17 in the 2005 AFC championship game on Jan. 22, 2006.\n\nPatriots defense picks apart Texans to advance to AFC Championship\n\nC.J. Stroud's four first-half INTs doom Texans\n\nWhy Patriots can't afford another sloppy Drake Maye playoff performance\n\nWhere C.J. Stroud's disastrous day ranks among most turnovers in a playoff game\n\nCan Stidham pull a Jeff Hostettler – who led the Giants to a Super Bowl XXV victory after Phil Simms was injured. Hostettler had two regular-season starts before the playoffs. A week might not be enough time for Denver here. It’s just going to be tough to pull this off without the Patriots imploding on the road.\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\nThe two regular-season matchups were decided by a combined total of three points, including a wild 38-37 overtime thriller on Dec. 18. The NFC West rivals split the regular-season series, and three of the last four meetings at Seattle have gone into overtime.\n\nWalker is coming off a huge game, and he had 11 carries for 100 yards and a TD in the last meeting. The Rams allowed 160 rushing yards against the Bears, so Seattle can be patient with the two-headed rushing attack of Walker and Zach Charbonnet. Jared Verse has to be a difference maker off the edge for Los Angeles.\n\nThat should help Darnold – who finished 51 of 78 (65.4%) for an average of 274.5 yards, two TDs and six interceptions in the two regular-season meetings against the Rams. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 17 catches for 201 yards and a TD in those two games, and that is the matchup Seattle needs to win consistently in the passing game. Five different Los Angeles players had interceptions in those games, and the Rams intercepted Caleb Williams three times in the divisional playoff win. Turnovers will be key here, especially on the road.\n\nHow swarming Seattle defense is peaking at right time\n\nWatch Rashid Shaheed take opening kickoff for TD\n\nThis is another opportunity for Stafford, who had a 57.1% completion percentage in those two meetings but also did not take a sack. He had 457 yards and three TDs in the last meeting. Will Seattle coach Michael Macdonald choose to dial up the pressure in order to take Stafford out of rhythm with receivers Puka Nacua and Davante Adams? Tight end Cody Parkinson had 10 carries for 90 yards and a TD in two playoff games, too. The Rams also will look to establish the running game with Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. The Seahawks allowed 5.3 yards per carry in their regular-season loss in the Rams and 3.2 yards per carry in the win.\n\nThe Rams were 4-5 S/U on the road, but they are 1-1 ATS as an underdog in the regular season, but they have won S/U as a road favorite each of the last two weeks. Seattle is 8-2 S/U and 6-4 ATS at home. The Seahawks are 3-0 S/U at home in the NFC championship game.\n\nIt's shaping up to be another instant classic between these rivals, but the Rams had a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in that last meeting and they have survived two tough road games. Does Stafford have one more road victory in him? It's hard not to trust the MVP-caliber quarterback in this matchup.\n\nRams fend off Bears' comeback attempt to advance to NFC Championship\n\nCaleb Williams overtime interception dooms Bears\n\nWatch Caleb Williams uncork spectacular TD pass to Cole Kmet to force overtime",

    "description": "After the NFL regular season was spiced by debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to have such drama.",
    "fullText": "Even worse for the heartbroken Buffalo Bills as Ja’Quan McMillian ripped the football away from Brandin Cooks for the interception that gave the Denver Broncos new life in overtime of the Jan. 17 AFC divisional playoff game was the sight of back judge Scott Helverson instantly signaling a turnover.\n\nRather than a 39-yard completion that could have set up a potential game-winning field goal, the Bills saw victory snatched from their grasp in a hail of controversy.\n\nThe ruling from New York – where the NFL reviews all turnovers from its officiating command center at league headquarters – didn’t make it better for the Bills Mafia.\n\nAnd it will linger as another symbol of frustration for a franchise that has come up short again in its quest to get back to the Super Bowl.\n\n“It’s hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled,” Bills coach Sean McDermott said during an emotional postgame news conference after the Broncos advanced to the AFC championship game with a 33-30 victory.\n\nSorry, Buffalo. It wouldn’t be the NFL without some sort of officiating controversy. After the dramatic regular season was spiced by several cases that inflamed debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to come wrapped with such drama.\n\nThe Bills – plus armchair quarterbacks, ex-players, informed analysts, internet influencers and probably others – maintained that Cooks should have been ruled down by contact after hauling in the rainbow throw from Josh Allen that traveled 55 yards in the air. Cooks and McMillian tumbled to the turf and rolled over with the nickel back emerging with the football.\n\nReferee Carl Cheffers explained that Cooks never had possession of the football as he crashed to the turf.\n\n“The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender was awarded the ball,” Cheffers said in the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) pool report.\n\nMaybe so. Yet that hardly addresses the inconsistency that is often at the heart of debate concerning the calls or non-calls by NFL officials.\n\nHow many times have we seen a receiver barely touch the ground with a knee hitting the turf – as Cooks did – and getting credit for the catch?\n\nSure, there’s always a different perspective with freeze-frame video versus real-time eyesight. That’s part of what the officiating experts – in New York and on the field – undoubtedly have to process.\n\nIn any event, for Bills fans, the would-be catch by Cooks is their version of the “Dez Bryant caught it” controversy that dogged the Dallas Cowboys after the receiver’s apparent catch was ruled incomplete in an NFC divisional playoff loss at Green Bay in January 2015.\n\nOf course, McMillian wonders what the fuss is about.\n\n“I don’t really think he had complete control going down,” he said. “We were both fighting for the ball. I just made a play and basically took it out of his hands and came up with it.”\n\nAdding to Buffalo’s consternation were the two pass interference calls against Taron Johnson and Tre’Davious White, for 17 and 30 yards, respectively, that set up Wil Lutz’s chip-shot winning field goal.\n\nBlame the refs? Cheffers’ crew couldn’t be blamed for the DPI calls – Johnson pulled on Courtland Sutton’s arm as Bo Nix’s pass arrived. White hit intended target Marvin Mims, Jr. early – even in a game where it appeared the officials were not necessarily calling it tight.\n\nStill, you may never convince the Bills – stung in last year’s playoff by a questionable spot on an Allen run in crunch time of the AFC title game loss a Kansas City – that McMillian’s interception should have stood.\n\nMcDermott was unable to challenge the ruling for two reasons. All turnovers and scoring plays are automatically reviewed in New York at any point in the game. Besides, it was overtime, when coaches are unable to challenge a play as all replay reviews are initiated in New York.\n\nStill, credit McDermott for his next-best, last-gasp option: He called a timeout and requested a quick chat with Cheffers, who told him the turnover was confirmed in New York.\n\n“It was a rather rapid unfolding of the review, if there was a review, and so I called a timeout to try to slow it down,” McDermott said. “It would seem logical to me and make a lot of sense that the head official would walk over and want to go and take a look at it. Just to make sure that everybody from here who is in the stadium, to there (in New York) are on the same page. That’s too big of a play, in my estimation, too big of a play in a play that decided the game, potentially … to not even slow it down. That’s why I had to call the timeout.”\n\nThe controversy, nonetheless, will live on. Scrutiny on officials will likely intensify during the offseason as the NFL engages in negotiations with the union for officials as the expiration of their labor pact looms.\n\nSean Payton gets it. The Broncos coach had his own moment of officiating controversy in a high-stakes game during his tenure with the New Orleans Saints. A non-call of pass interference near the goal line stung New Orleans during an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams during the 2018 NFC Championship Game at the Superdome.\n\nHad the Broncos not survived on Sunday, Payton might have some sort of flashback – and surely been livid about an apparent missed call in overtime. Early on Buffalo’s final possession, it appeared that a holding call was missed as Allen threw from his end zone. A flag would have resulted in a safety.\n\n“A phenomenal play by ‘J-Mac,’” Payton said of McMillian’s interception. “But it should’ve ended really with a safety, which would’ve been the first in the history of football.”\n\nA playoff game ending on a penalty would have surely ignited some controversy.\n\nHey, there’s always next weekend.\n\nContact Jarrett Bell at jbell@usatoday.com or follow on X: @JarrettBell\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bills vs Broncos interception controversy explained",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots punched their ticket to the AFC Championship on Sunday, January 18, with a hard-fought 28-16 victory over the Houston Texans. In a game defined by a relentless Foxborough snowstorm, Mike Vrabel’s squad overcame a turnover-heavy first half to secure the franchise's first conference title berth since 2019.\n\nThe matchup lived up to its billing as a defensive slugfest. While the Texans’ top-ranked unit made life difficult for Drake Maye, forcing him into four fumbles, the Patriots’ defense proved even more opportunistic. New England feasted on a record-tying four interceptions from C.J. Stroud, including a crucial Marcus Jones pick-six that swung the momentum for good. Despite the sloppy conditions, Maye’s three touchdown passes provided the necessary spark to push the Patriots past a Houston team that had dominated the Wild Card round.\n\nWith the win, the Patriots now look ahead to a high-stakes trip to higher altitudes next Sunday, January 25. Now, a new generation takes the stage as the Patriots aim to rewrite history and claim the all-time postseason wins record for themselves.\n\nHere is more on who the Patriots play next in the 2026 NFL playoffs.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nWith the win, the Patriots move on to the AFC Championship, facing the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos squeaked past the Buffalo Bills and Josh Allen, automatically getting home-field advantage for the AFC Championship Game. Mile High is certainly no easy place to play, and Denver earned the right to host by clinching the No. 1 overall seed. Though Denver suffered a brutal blow when starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury.\n\nThe matchup carries heavy foreshadowing. The last time these two storied franchises met in the AFC Championship was exactly a decade ago in January 2016. That legendary \"Mile High\" battle served as the final postseason chapter of the Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning rivalry — a game the Broncos won 20-18 on their way to a Super Bowl title.\n\nThis time around, with a new quarterback at the helm, New England is searching for revenge.",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills’ season ended on Saturday after a 33-30 loss to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. Meanwhile, the New England Patriots will play their Divisional Round game on Sunday.\n\nThe Bills have one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL, but have not been able to get over the hump with Josh Allen. One of their biggest flaws as a team is that they lack a true No. 1 receiver. That is one of the reasons they failed to win the division over the Patriots.\n\nTheir leading receiver this season was Khalil Shakir, who had 719 yards on 72 receptions. The Bills have failed to replace Stefon Diggs after losing him. However, they can land a star this offseason. ESPN’s Ben Solak predicted they would trade for A.J. Brown.\n\n“A year after general manager Brandon Beane’s emphatic statement that they didn’t need a WR1 went over disastrously, Buffalo will tilt and get aggressive,” Solak wrote on Saturday. “The Bills will trade a first-round pick and then some for Philadelphia’s A.J. Brown, believing he can be the final player to push their offense over the edge.”\n\nBrown’s issues with the Philadelphia Eagles have been well documented. Multiple times this season, he expressed frustration with his role. In the Eagles’ final game, he was seen arguing with Nick Sirianni on the sideline.\n\nBrown made multiple trade requests last season, according to Joseph Santoliquito of SB Nation. General manager Howie Roseman downplayed trade rumors after the Eagles’ season ended, but many teams could call about Brown.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/2Mf6wJm47JSXK22DVoVot4\n\nHis outbursts and frustration have been going on for a few seasons at this point. He is still an elite receiver and could put up monster numbers with Allen in Buffalo. The Bills getting Brown could be a problem for the Patriots.\n\nBrown is a three-time Pro Bowler and three-time Second-Team All-Pro. He has surpassed 1,000 yards every season of his career except one. He had 869 yards in 2021, but missed multiple games.\n\nIn four seasons with the Eagles, he has 5,034 yards and 32 touchdowns in the regular season. He could make the Bills an even bigger threat to the Patriots in the AFC East.\n\nThe Patriots are also contenders to land Brown if he is traded. They do not need him as badly as other teams, but his connection to Mike Vrabel certainly makes the Patriots a landing spot.\n\nFormer Patriots Receiver Defends Josh Allen After Bills’ Playoff Exit",

Next up, Stefanski will look to fill out his coaching staff. There already have been a few names linked to Atlanta.\n\nThe Falcons are expected to hire Bill Callahan as offensive line coach and retain defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, but what about Atlanta's offensive coordinator position. Zac Robinson is unlikely to return and has already interviewed for three other vacancies.\n\nAccording to a report from NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Stefanski is eyeing Tommy Rees to be the team's new offensive coordinator. Rees served as Cleveland's offensive coordinator in 2025, working closely with Stefanski.\n\nPrior to joining the Browns staff in 2024, Rees was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Alabama in 2023, and held the same role at Notre Dame from 2020-2023.\n\nFrom @NFLGameDay Morning: The #Falcons hired coach Kevin Stefanski as their next head coach, and his staff is already coming together. pic.twitter.com/Q2DvRUGobE\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 18, 2026\n\nStefanski is an experienced play-caller, and most assume he will continue to call plays in Atlanta.

    "description": "Packers fans will be hoping that old friend Davante Adams can help bring the Bears’ season to an end.",
    "fullText": "Green Bay Packers fans saw their team bomb out of the playoffs last Saturday, giving up 25 fourth-quarter points to the Chicago Bears in a brutal 31-27 loss. With that result, the Bears advanced to this weekend’s Divisional Playoffs, where they face a Los Angeles Rams team that is, in the eyes of many NFL analysts, the best team in the NFL.\n\nThe Rams had to scrape and claw their way to a win in their own Wild Card game, however, scoring a late touchdown to defeat the Carolina Panthers 34-31 on the road. That game saw those two teams trade scores throughout the fourth quarter, but it was Matthew Stafford’s connection to Colby Parkinson with 38 seconds left that proved to be the difference.\n\nPackers fans would surely love to see an old friend knock the Bears out of the postseason, however. Davante Adams is the #2 option in the Rams’ passing game behind Puka Nacua, and tonight’s game would be a perfect time for Adams to deliver a classic performance. In 17 career games against the Bears (16 with the Packers and one with the Raiders), Adams has totaled 88 catches for 1,081 yards and ten touchdowns — a very solid full season’s worth of numbers.\n\nAdams’ last game against the Bears while wearing green and gold came in December of 2021. In that contest, he roasted Chicago’s secondary with 10 receptions, 121 yards, and two touchdowns. His only better game against Chicago was in late 2016, when he caught 13 balls for 132 and two scores. All told, Adams had four 100-yard games when playing the Bears. If he can do anything like that again tonight, the Rams should be headed to the NFC Championship.\n\nOf course, that game comes after the AFC’s 2-5 matchup, which puts one of the league’s best defenses in the Houston Texans against the potential MVP, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye. That should be a fun game to watch as a relatively neutral observer before turning into big-time Rams fans for the final game of the weekend.\n\nJoin us in the comments to discuss both games!\n\nGame Time: 3:00 PM Eastern Time (2:00 PM Central)\nTV Channel: ESPN & ABC\nCommentators: Joe Buck, Troy Aikman\nPoint spread: Patriots -3\n\nGame Time: 5:30 PM Central Time\nTV Channel: NBC\nCommentators: Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth\nPoint spread: Rams -3.5",

Instead, penalties proved costly for Buffalo.\n\nThe Broncos edged the Bills 33–30 in overtime in the divisional round at Mile High, and flags played a decisive role on the final drive.\n\nOn the possession that set up Wil Lutz’s game-winning field goal, Buffalo was twice called for defensive pass interference.

    "fullText": "That was supremely satisfying. Mike Macdonald loves his rallying cries, whether it’s “12 as one”, “Chasing Edges,” or “E.A.T.”. I’ve got another one for the Seattle Seahawks after that 41-6 dismantling of the San Francisco 49ers in the Division Round – Professional Destruction.\n\nThose two words embody Macdonald’s vision for the team and perfectly encapsulate the way Seattle has been playing for the last two months. ‘The Dark Side” defense has been utterly suffocating opposing offenses while the running game has been on a roll. For weeks I’ve been trying to find different ways to describe the dominance the Seahawks have been showcasing, particularly on the defensive side. The way Ken Walker is running behind this nasty offensive line, the offense also fully deserves the Professional Destruction moniker.\n\nKen Walker III is really damn good…historically good for the Seahawks playoffs actually.\n\n@Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III tied the postseason franchise record with three rushing touchdowns. #GoHawks\n\n— Seahawks PR (@seahawksPR) January 18, 2026\n\nThe offensive line was giving him good creases and Walker was hitting the hole with burst. He also had some fantastic cutbacks and broke tackles on the way. Maybe the most emblematic run of how the Seahawks are playing right now was the one in the fourth quarter where he ran into a crowd and got pushed about five yards farther when the rest of the team got in on the action. The Seahawks are physically imposing their will on the opponents. I would take his stat line of 19 carries for 116 yards and 3 TDs any day.\n\nErnest Jones IV is really damn good. He singlehandedly caused two turnovers today, stripping the ball from Jake Tonges on Seattle’s second defensive drive and picked off Brock Purdy later in the game. He’s a tackling machine and is the leader in the middle of the defense getting everyone lined up. Picking up Jones in a trade last season is one of the best trades John Schneider has made as GM of the Seahawks.\n\nRashid Shaheed is really damn good. Speaking of great trades by John Schneider, the Shaheed trade is the gift that keeps on giving. His opening kickoff return for a TD was literally the game-winner, and was his third return TD since joining the Seahawks at the trade deadline. Shaheed also had a huge run on an end-around and drew a pass interference penalty. With Tory Horton’s injury, adding Shaheed has been a massive key to the Seahawks success this season.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence is really damn good. He got to Brock Purdy on his first throw of the game, nearly forcing a fumble. Later, he blew up a fourth down play. Even later, he strip-sacked Purdy and the ball was recovered by Nick Emmanwori. Tank came to the Seahawks because he thought they had a chance to win the Super Bowl. He’s doing his best to make that a reality.\n\nPlayoff Cooper Kupp is awesome. His stat line of 5 catches for 60 yards might not be the most impressive, but all of them seemed to come at crucial times. Kupp was the reliable safety blanket that everyone hoped he would be after signing with his hometown team.\n\nThe tight ends didn’t have any catches today, but they all blocked their asses off. AJ Barner and Eric Saubert were both throwing key blocks on the outside runs that Walker was so effective with against the 49ers. That kind of selfless play is why those guys are beloved.\n\nIt was good to see Charles Cross and Coby Bryant back out there. Bryant finished the game, unlike Cross, but hopefully it was just precautionary with Charles. Zach Charbonnet was injured as well, but the initial prognosis was somewhat hopeful. He’s a huge part of the third down packages and a touchdown machine, so having him miss time would hurt the offense.\n\nThe offensive line blocked really well again today as evidenced by the 175 yards rushing, the fourth week in a row that Seattle ran for 150+ yards. At this point, I don’t think it’s a fluke. No better time for the run game to come alive than at the most important time of the season!\n\nSeattle will host the NFC Championship game for the first time in over a decade and got damn does it feel good! Whether it’s the third matchup with the Los Angeles Rams or a showdown with the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears, it’s sure to be a wild atmosphere. Until then, enjoy this one folks. This is a special, special team!",

    "fullText": "NFL playoffs overtime rules, explained: How tie games are decided compared to regular season, preseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCan an NFL playoff game end in a tie?\n\nNFL overtime rules for playoff games\n\nNFL overtime rules for regular season\n\nNFL overtime rules for preseason\n\nHistory of NFL playoff overtime rules\n\nPlayoff football tends to be neck-and-neck. Sometimes, it even requires some extra time.\n\nWhile no games in last year's NFL playoffs required overtime, it wasn't too long ago that the Super Bowl went an extra frame, when the Kansas City Chiefs took down the San Francisco 49ers to go back-to-back in February 2024 on a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime.\n\nGiven the nature of the postseason, NFL overtime rules are a bit different in the playoffs vs. the regular season. Most notably, the playoff rules prioritize giving both teams a chance to win, something that changed in recent years.\n\nHere's everything to know about how the 2026 NFL playoff overtime rules work, and how they compare to the regular season and preseason.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about the NFL's virtual measurement system\n\nNo, an NFL playoff game cannot end in a tie. In the preseason and regular season, games can end in ties. However, with the league needing a team to move on to the next round of the playoffs, there is no possibility of a tie in the postseason.\n\nTeams will play more overtime periods until a tie is broken in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: How does NFL MVP voting work?\n\nThe NFL's newest overtime rules for playoff games were implemented in the 2023 postseason. The biggest change was largely in response to the 2022 AFC Championship Game between the Chiefs and Bills, guaranteeing that both teams would get a possession in overtime.\n\nHere's how OT works for playoff games via the NFL rulebook:\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended — the teams will play another overtime period. There can be no ties in the playoffs. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nThe captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend, unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team will have an opportunity to possess the ball in overtime.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nRegardless of whether the team who receives the opening overtime kickoff scores a touchdown, the other team is guaranteed a possession.  However, the game is over if a safety or defensive touchdown is scored.\n\nIf the game is tied after both teams possess the ball once, then the next score wins.\n\nMORE: Explaining how the NCAA OT format works and differences from NFL\n\nIn comparison to the postseason, overtime in the NFL regular season is a bit different, mostly because games can end in ties.\n\nHere are the official regular season overtime rules, via the NFL rulebook:\n\nAt the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nNo more than one 10-minute period will follow a three-minute intermission. Each team must possess, or have the opportunity to possess, the ball, rather than one team being able to win the game by scoring on its first overtime possession. The exception is if the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, then the team that kicked off is the winner.\n\nSudden death play — where the game ends on any score (safety, field goal or touchdown) — continues until a winner is determined after each team has had an opportunity to possess the ball.\n\nThe point after try is not attempted if the game ends on a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of the overtime period, the result of the game will be recorded as a tie.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the NFL's newest kickoff rules\n\nThe most straightforward NFL overtime rules come in the preseason: there is no overtime. With. games not counting for much in the preseason, the league doesn't bother to try and break ties.\n\nThat change was made in 2021, prioritizing player health and safety in games that do not have any bearing on the standings. Players can be evaluated from the first through fourth quarters, and no extra periods are necessary.\n\nMORE: Why does the NFL allow ties in the regular season?\n\nA lot has changed since the first NFL game to go to overtime on Aug. 28, 1955, between the Rams and Giants. That game was played under “sudden death” rules, and the Rams won. From there, the overtime format was fully introduced.\n\nThe NFL moved forward with that model before implementing sudden-death overtime for regular-season games 16 years later. In the original format, the first team to score any points at all won the game. That included kicking a game-winning field goal. “Sudden death” remained the format for 35 years.\n\nIn 2010, the playoff overtime rules were tweaked. For teams that received the ball first, a field goal no longer counted as a game-ender in “sudden death.” Under the change, only a touchdown on the first possession of overtime could win the game in the playoffs. Otherwise, the other team would get a possession.\n\nThat format was added to the preseason and regular season in 2012.\n\nThe length of overtime was altered in 2017, decreasing from a full 15 minutes to just 10 minutes.\n\nIn 2021, overtime was removed from preseason games, with the NFL citing player safety to avoid unnecessary periods.\n\nMost recently, the NFL changed the playoff overtime rules in 2022, assuring both teams would get at least one possession in overtime of a postseason game. Regardless of whether the first team scored a touchdown, the other team was given a shot to tie the game or come back to win it. If the score remained tied after each team had a possession, then “sudden death” began.\n\nMORE: What is considered a catch in the NFL?\n\nHere are the six longest NFL games ever, all of which went deep into overtime. Because regular season games can end in ties, the longest overtime games all consist of playoff games.\n\nAll six of the games below required two overtime periods to decide a winner.\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Dolphins vs. Chiefs)\n\nAFL Championship (Texans vs. Oilers)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Browns vs. Jets)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Ravens vs. Broncos)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Raiders vs. Colts)\n\nNFC Divisional Round (Panthers vs. Rams)\n\nMORE:What is Scorigami in the NFL?",

This time, the key difference is the absence of Patrick Mahomes and the three-time AFC champion Chiefs.\n\nThe Broncos, after going 14-3 in the regular season, are the top contenders in the AFC, in large part due to their defense.

Lutz has been busy and drills another short field goal.\n\nDenver now leads by 13, and Allen will need to show some of that playoff magic if the Bills are to come back against this defensive unit.\n\n6:20 p.m.: History is against the Bills, and the fumble on their opening drive of the second half is not going to help.\n\nThe Bills are 2-13 in the playoffs in franchise history when trailing at halftime.\n\nThey’re down 20-10 in Denver at half after the Broncos scored 10 in the final 30 seconds. pic.twitter.com/y21jeFHLwP\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 17, 2026\n\n6:18 p.m.: Ball security issues continue for the Bills as Allen is sacked and stripped. Three turnovers in five drives for the Bills and two fumbles in three snaps.\n\nThe Broncos are in a prime position to extend the lead they built.\n\n6:06 p.m.: After the Bills scored the game's first touchdown and then got the ball right back, Denver fans may have been nervous. However, Buffalo has two fumbles that the Broncos not only recovered, but scored points off.\n\nThe Broncos could not have had a better end to the first half, scoring 10 points in 22 seconds. Buffalo will start with the ball, and Allen will look to make up for the costly fumble.\n\n6:00 p.m. FIELD GOAL: After a disastrous fumble by Allen with the half winding down, the Broncos took advantage of it and extended their lead.\n\nBroncos ball!\n\nWhat a break before the half 😳\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/317eodiE90\n\nDenver scored 10 points in the final 22 seconds of the first half.\n\n5:58 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Nix looked sharp in the two-minute drill, throwing several strikes and picking up yards with his legs.\n\nRedemption for Lil'Jordan Humphrey!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/2fGMhIkwyb\n\nNix then launched a beautiful 29-yard touchdown to Humphrey to take the lead once again against the Bills. Humphrey dropped a touchdown in the first quarter, but made up for it\n\n5:53 p.m.: The Broncos will be without Pat Bryant after leaving the game with three catches on the game's opening drive.\n\nTroy Franklin is also questionable to return with a hamstring injury. The Broncos will now have to heavily rely on Sutton and Mims, who are already banged up.\n\n5:46 p.m.: Broncos are able to cross midfield with under a minute to go in the half. Nix once again rushed for a first down.\n\nBo scrambling!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/UcPe85ot1F\n\nDenver is driving and looking to score before halftime.\n\n5:36 p.m. FIELD GOAL: The Bills were unable to answer the Broncos' touchdown with one of their own, but they managed to tie the game with a 33-yard field goal made by Matt Prater.\n\n5:34 p.m.: The Bills put together a good drive on a 24-yard pass to Cook, then faced some adversity after a sack made it 2nd and long.\n\nBeautiful route by the veteran Brandin Cooks on third down\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8ysFSIOAtr\n\nHowever, Allen connected with Bradin Cooks for a 15-yard pass to keep the drive alive.\n\n5:25 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Denver makes the most of the Cook fumble and scores on some trickery. Frank Crum, the offensive tackle, caught a touchdown pass from Bo Nix.\n\nFRANK CRUM BIG MAN TD\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8SEiIm527H\n\nThe Broncos take the lead off of some creativity from Sean Payton.\n\n5:17 p.m.: Cook was drilled by Alex Singleton and fumbled the ball. The Broncos recovered it, and now Denver has excellent field position.\n\nBroncos ball! Alex Singleton forces the fumble 😳\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/msSHg9AKXj\n\nThis marks Cook's fourth fumble of the season which is tied for the most among other RBs.\n\nThat fumble was James Cook's fourth of the year, including regular season, most among RBs, and one more than he had in his first three seasons combined, per @ESPNInsights.\n\n— Alaina Getzenberg (@agetzenberg) January 17, 2026\n\n5:15 p.m.: Allen scrambles for a 25-yard run, Buffalo dominating on the ground. They've already picked up 75 yards on only 10 carries.\n\n5:11 p.m.: The Broncos are unable to do anything on their second drive of the game. Courtland Sutton nearly made a diving catch on third down, but it was ruled incomplete.\n\nThe Bills will send Allen and company back onto the field, looking to extend their lead.\n\n5:07 p.m.: At the end of one, both offenses had promising opening drives, but only one was able to capitalize with six. Cook was spectacular on the Bills' first drive, as was Allen.\n\nThe Broncos fumbled on the final play of the opening quarter but recovered. It will be 2 and 10 after the break for Denver\n\n5:04 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: With Cook and Allen dominating Denver with the ground game, Allen only needed to complete four passes.\n\nMecole Hardman playoff TDs are back!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/CWy8FUMSXh\n\nAllen was able to complete a 4-yard pass to Mecole Hardman to put the Bills on top just before the opening quarter is about to end.\n\n4:55 p.m.: Pat Surtain looked shaken up and is heading towards the blue medical tent. The Broncos certainly cannot afford to lose their all-pro corner.\n\n4:54 p.m.: After having a technical issue with his helmet, Allen was forced to call a timeout. Allen changed his helmet and is now set to go.\n\n4:53 p.m.: James Cook picks up a chunk play on the first play for the Buffalo Bills on offense. Cook picked up 24 yards on his first carry.\n\n24 yards from James Cook on the Bills' first offensive snap!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/T1PX6LlBOZ\n\n4:50 p.m. FIELD GOAL: After a dropped touchdown by Lil'Jordan Humphrey, the Broncos have to settle for a field goal in the red zone. Will Lutz drilled the 28-yarder to open up the scoring.\n\n4:49 p.m.: The Broncos were fortunate that a fumble was overturned due to an offside by the Bills.\n\n4:46 p.m.: On 4th down, the Broncos once again run Nix, and he picks up the first down. The Broncos' offense had picked up four first downs on this drive.\n\n4:43 p.m.: After a completion for a first down on the first throw of the game, Jaleel McLaughlin showed incredible effort to gain five yards. Pat Bryant, who had three catches on the opening drive, was a bit shaken up.\n\nOn the first third down for the Broncos, Nix keeps it for a 5-yard run and first down. The Broncos are driving into Buffalo territory on the opening drive.\n\nBo had the defense fooled on the read option\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/ljd2CTiyI6\n\n4:35 p.m.: Bills' Dorian Williams on special teams was in a huge collision on the opening kickoff and is down, injury timeout in Denver.\n\nThe entire Bills team has come off the sideline to check on Dorian Williams. He is able to get up and come off the field supported by Bills staff.\n\n— Alaina Getzenberg (@agetzenberg) January 17, 2026\n\n4:33 p.m.: The Bills have deferred, which means Bo Nix and the Broncos offense will take the field first.\n\n4:20 p.m.: Josh Allen firing up his guys before they take the field at Denver.

There was always a chance that not every postseason game would be decided in four quarters.\n\nThe divisional round is providing NFL fans with their first look at overtime in the 2025 postseason. The Buffalo Bills forced OT against the Denver Broncos with a late field goal by Matt Prater.\n\nThis marks the sixth overtime playoff game in the last six seasons.\n\nHere's what to know about the overtime rules in the NFL playoffs:\n\nIf the score is tied after regulation, there's another coin toss. Here's what the rules are:\n\nThe overtime period is 15 minutes long.\n\nIt is 10 minutes in the regular season.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts per half (two overtime periods).\n\nEach team will have a possession, but the game does not automatically end if the first team scores a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied after each team gets one possession, the next score wins.\n\nAn exception is made if the team that first possesses the ball commits a safety. The kickoff team wins in this scenario, the same as in the regular season.\n\nExtra points are not attempted if the game ends in a touchdown.\n\nAll replays are initiated by the replay official and not by the coach's challenge.\n\nWild card round: Saturday, Jan. 10 to Monday, Jan. 12, 2026\n\nDivisional round: Saturday, Jan. 17 to Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026\n\nConference championship: Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026\n\nSuper Bowl: Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFL overtime rules: What are OT rules in playoffs?",

    "fullText": "Bills' plan for deploying Ed Oliver vs. Broncos revealed by NFL insider originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are getting a key player back for their divisional-round game against the Denver Broncos and it is none other than defensive tackle Ed Oliver.\n\nOliver suffered a torn biceps injury midway through the season, and while he was expected to not return at all this campaign, he is now on the cusp of doing so.\n\nEarlier in the week, Oliver was designated to return from injured reserve and after turning in three limited practices, he was activated from the list.\n\nWhile he still carries a questionable tag, the expectation is Oliver will play.\n\nNow, it remains to be seen how much Oliver is actually going to play.\n\nThe expectation has been that he won't play a full complement of snaps, which wouldn't be surprising given his lengthy absence.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe, that is exactly what is going to happen.\n\n\"Ed [Oliver] won’t be 100% today and will play limited reps but Buffalo believes 'a rusty Ed is better than most,'\" Wolfe reported.\n\nWe will likely see Oliver play the majority of his snaps, at least, on obvious passing downs, as the star defensive tackle shines as a pass-rusher more than a run defender.\n\nEven though Oliver isn't going to play a full game, the simple fact that he is out there and able to play not only provides a boost to the defense, but to the team's morale, also.\n\nKevin Stefanski rumor is troubling development for Titans, Ravens\n\nRaiders rumor pinpoints possible favorite for head coach job\n\nGiants rumors detail holdup with John Harbaugh's contract\n\nMike McDaniel-Raiders rumor is bad news for Eagles, Lions, Bucs\n\nKevin Stefanski rumor is huge for Falcons, bad for Ravens, Titans\n\nTyreek Hill confuses Chiefs, Falcons fans with social media post",

    "fullText": "Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills aim to knock off the AFC’s top seed Saturday afternoon, facing the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.\n\nThe Broncos are -1.5 betting favorites at the best NFL betting sites.\n\nBelow, we will look at NFL player props for all of the top offensive players for the Bills and Broncos.\n\nOur computer projects big statistical games from James Cook, Khalil Shakir, Courtland Sutton, and Evan Engram.\n\nAllen Under 211.5 passing yards <<-110>>\n\nNix Over 210.5 passing yards <<-114>>\n\nCook Over 73.5 rushing yards <<-114>>\n\nHarvey Under 56.6 rushing yards <<-110>>\n\nShakir Over 49.5 receiving yards <<-110>>\n\nSutton Over 49.5 receiving yards <<-111>>\n\nKincaid Over 35.5 receiving yards <<-108>>\n\nEngram Over 20.5 receiving yards <<-110>>\n\nMake your postseason bets at FanDuel, America's No. 1 sportsbook! \n\nSportsbooks are giving Denver’s pass defense a ton of respect, but I’m not convinced it’s entirely warranted.\n\nThe Broncos looked like world-beaters against the likes of Trey Lance, Chris Oladokun, and Geno Smith, holding all three under 200 passing yards.\n\nWhen facing competent quarterbacks, however, yardage told a different story: Trevor Lawrence threw for 279 yards against Denver on Dec. 21, Jordan Love passed for 276 yards on Dec. 14, and even Marcus Mariota managed 294 yards through the air on Nov. 30.\n\nJosh Allen, a level or two above all of those QBs, showed last week that he can still rack up yardage, completing 28-of-35 passes for 273 yards against Jacksonville.\n\nI’ll start by disagreeing with the computer and take the Allen Over.\n\nCook has had an outstanding season, but this number feels a little too high against an excellent Denver front.\n\nSince Thanksgiving, the Broncos haven’t allowed a single running back to surpass 73.5 rushing yards. I expect Buffalo to focus on beating Denver through the air rather than on the ground, which likely limits Cook’s opportunities.\n\nI’ll disagree with the computer here and take the Under on Cook.\n\nThe Bills’ receiving corps has been decimated by injury, with both Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers tearing ACLs against Jacksonville.\n\nAs a result, all of Buffalo’s wide receivers should see increased targets. We already saw a sign of this last week: Shakir was targeted a season-high 12 times by Allen against the Jaguars, responding with 82 receiving yards.\n\nI’ll ride with the computer and take the Shakir Over.\n\nProjection: 37.1 receiving yards\n\nIn last year’s postseason matchup between the Bills and Broncos, Dalton Kincaid had 47 receiving yards.\n\nAllen’s trust in him has only grown this season, with the tight end averaging 43.5 receiving yards per game since the start of November.\n\nI’m on the side of our AI here. Take the Over.\n\nPredictions for every NFL Divisional Round game\n\nProjection: 218.0 passing yards\n\nA major reason the Broncos were non-competitive in last year’s 31-7 playoff loss to Buffalo was that Sean Payton didn’t trust Nix. The quarterback threw a season-low 22 passes in that game.\n\nFor context, Buffalo allowed Trevor Lawrence to pass for 207 yards last weekend. During the regular season, Denver’s passing output per game (223.9 yards) was nearly identical to Jacksonville’s (222.3).\n\nBecause I believe Payton will let Nix chuck it at least 30 times in this one, I like the Over (slightly). The computer and I agree.\n\nThis number is extremely high for Javonte Harvey, even against Buffalo’s porous run defense. Harvey became Denver’s lead back after Nov. 6, when JK Dobbins went down with an injury.\n\nIn the seven games since, he’s gone Over this number just twice.\n\nMeanwhile, coach Sean Payton has been giving more carries to 5-foot-7 back Jaleel McLaughlin. McLaughlin posted a season-high seven carries on Christmas against Kansas City, then added six carries for 41 yards on Jan. 4 against the Chargers.\n\nI’ll take the Harvey Under here, as will my computer pal.\n\nThe Broncos’ best win in the second half of the regular season came in a 34-26 victory over the Packers at Mile High. In that game, Nix targeted Sutton 10 times, and the receiver finished with 113 yards.\n\nBuffalo’s pass defense is impressive, but it’s not immune to big performances. Last week, Parker Washington racked up 107 yards, Tee Higgins had 92, Jaylen Waddle posted 84, and Stefon Diggs went for a whopping 146 yards against the Bills.\n\nI like Nix to target Sutton a ton, and the number is pretty low. The computer and I like the value on the Over.\n\nProjection: 25.2 receiving yards\n\nThe Bills do a tremendous job against opposing tight ends, allowing just 29.6 yards per game to the position during the regular season. In big games, they’ve been even more dominant.\n\nSince the start of December, Buffalo’s two biggest wins came against New England on Dec. 14 and Jacksonville in last week’s playoff matchup.\n\nThe Bills held Hunter Henry to just one catch for 18 yards against the Patriots and limited Brenton Strange to a season-low nine receiving yards versus the Jaguars.\n\nI’ll agree with the computer and take the Over.\n\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section give their thoughts on the Chargers' playoff exit, the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the, Lakers, Clippers and Chloe Kim.",
    "fullText": "If there’s an important playoff game for the Chargers to win, you can bet they’re going to lose. Such was the case again against New England.\n\nWhile having a decent enough defense, the offense was pathetic. And, yes, I know their offensive line was completely depleted. But, the 49ers were banged up as well. They lost George Kittle and still won.\n\nWell, there’s always “next season.” Unfortunately, those two words still haunt the Chargers and their fans.\n\nOnce again the Chargers flop in the playoffs.\n\nThis time much of the blame should be placed at the top with Jim Harbaugh. Perhaps he did not watch or was not aware of how many times in this year's playoffs teams had failed to convert on fourth down with disastrous consequences. The psychological effect on the team from failing to convert and put points on the board early was evident. He had a team without their top running back and a very weak offensive line yet chose to go for it.\n\nHopefully he will learn from this or maybe it is time for Harbaugh to join his brother in seeking new jobs.\n\nNothing wrong with the Chargers that a new OC with a game plan can't fix. Or is there?\n\nThanks for firing your OC Greg Roman. Loyalty is great but loyalty does not get you to the promised land. In two postseason trips, one touchdown to show for it.\n\nIt needed to be done for Justin Herbert & Co.\n\nThe Yankees won 27 World Series championships by being the best team money can buy. The west coast Yankees, aka the Dodgers, are now the best team money can buy. That's capitalism, baby!\n\nAs a Dodgers fan for a Joe DiMaggio-esque 56 consecutive seasons, I am happy to have Kyle Tucker in the Dodgers' outfield in 2026. Certainly, he will be an improvement over Michael Conforto, and allow Teoscar Hernandez to go back to left field.\n\nHowever, I find it perplexing that a player who appeared in only 78 and 136 games in 2024 and 2025, and who has had only one top 10 MVP finish (fifth in 2023) in his career, would be signed for a whopping average of $60-million annually. To earn that enormous salary over the next four seasons, Tucker should be considered the best player in baseball not named Shohei Ohtani.\n\nNewsflash! The Dodgers buy another superstar, cost be damned! I'm not a Dodgers fan. I'm a Baseball fan, witnessing an organization job a system that destroys parity and fairplay. So go ahead — hop aboard the Dodgers bandwagon for another championship. While baseball fans everywhere else throw up their hands in disgust and flock to the NFL.\n\nThe Dodgers' signing of Kyle Tucker for ridiculous money now ensures a (stoppage) after this baseball season. For everyone saying other teams could do the same thing, really? As much as anyone could love the Dodgers, this just takes away from the game.\n\nIf you’re mad at the Dodgers don't stop there — might as well don a cape and be super mad because MLB has no kryptonite against them.\n\nWe should not expect too much from the Lakers. We have the same offense ran by the Dallas Mavericks for Luka Doncic transplanted to L.A. Give the ball to Luka and everyone else stands around and watch. Who is teaching these guys defense?\n\nHow many more games do fans have to endure before the Lakers hire a coach who is a defensive specialist? Where is Frank Vogel when you need him?\n\nThe only way I see the Lakers or Clippers making it to the second round of the playoffs is if they play each other in the first round.\n\nThe womens' snowboarding competition at next month's Winter Olympics in Milan has taken an interesting twist. American Chloe Kim, two-time Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe, will have to wear a shoulder brace after tearing her labrum. This would be analogous to having one arm tied behind your back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

Adams rates among the best WRs vs. man-to-man and has been L.A.’s top downfield threat, averaging 24 air yards per reception.\n\nThe Bears limit yards after the catch but have been burned over the top, bleeding the third-most air yards and second-most explosive pass plays.\n\nAdams’ projections sit north of 60 yards with a ceiling of 67 yards.\n\nAdams is another game healthier after returning to play last weekend and has been Matthew Stafford’s favorite option in the end zone.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams are known for their strong starts, averaging more than 15 points per first half. Chicago has a bad habit of falling behind, hemorrhaging 62 total 1H points in the past three games.\n\nDavante Adams Over 53.5 receiving yards\n\nDavante Adams anytime touchdown\n\nRams first-half team total Over 13.5 points\n\nRome Odunze has the downfield pop to exploit a Rams secondary that has given up deep passing plays down the stretch. He’ll be another week healthier after returning in the Wild Card round.\n\nDavante Adams Over 53.5 receiving yards\n\nDavante Adams anytime touchdown\n\nRome Odunze Over 35.5 receiving yards\n\nSpread: Rams -3.5 (-118) | Bears +3.5 (-104)\n\nMoneyline: Rams -198 | Bears +166\n\nOver/Under: Over 48.5 | Under 48.5\n\nChicago has been a live home underdog, going just 4-6 SU but 6-2-2 ATS when catching points inside Soldier Field over the last three seasons.
