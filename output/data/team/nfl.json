Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Saints quarterback Drew Brees is on a fast track to the Pro Football Hall of Fame — and few would argue otherwise.\n\nThe Super Bowl XLIV champion was named one of the 15 finalists for the Class of 2026, placing him one step away from enshrinement in Canton.\n\nThe Hall’s 50-member selection committee will vote on the finalists next month, with the results announced Feb. 5 during “NFL Honors.” Under the current format, between three and five modern-era finalists will be inducted, marking the second year of the revised process.\n\nBrees’ résumé is among the strongest in NFL history. He ranks second all-time to Tom Brady with 80,358 passing yards and 571 touchdown passes. After spending the first five seasons of his career with the San Diego Chargers, Brees signed with New Orleans in 2006 — a move that changed both his career and the franchise’s trajectory.\n\nHe became the face of a city rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina and ultimately led the Saints to their first Super Bowl title following the 2009 season, earning Super Bowl MVP honors in a win over Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nOver his career, Brees was selected to 13 Pro Bowls, won AP Offensive Player of the Year twice (2008, 2011), earned first-team All-Pro honors in 2006 and was named second-team All-Pro four times.\n\nJoining Brees as finalists are first-year eligibles Larry Fitzgerald, Jason Witten and Frank Gore. Willie Anderson, Torry Holt, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri earned automatic finalist status after advancing to the final seven for the Class of 2025.\n\nReturning finalists include Eli Manning, Reggie Wayne, Jahri Evans, Marshal Yanda, Terrell Suggs and Darren Woodson, while defensive tackle Kevin Williams reached the finalist stage for the first time in his sixth year of eligibility.\n\nThe committee will also consider senior candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood, along with coach Bill Belichick and contributor Robert Kraft. Between one and three of those candidates will be inducted.\n\nOnly four people were inducted last year, making it the smallest Hall of Fame class in the past 20 years.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza's primary focus is beating the Alabama Crimson Tidein the Rose Bowl.\n\nBut some analysts are already looking ahead, including ESPN's Greg McElroy, who wants to see a struggling NFL franchise take a shot by drafting the Heisman Trophy winner.\n\nEnter the possibility of Mendoza heading to New Jersey, McElroy said Tuesday.\n\n“Right now, I would go with the upside that you get with Dante Moore and Fernando Mendoza,” McElroy said. “I think Jaxson Dart, at this point, is a really high-floor prospect. You kind of know what you’re going to get. … But there’s mechanical inconsistencies that will not be fixed immediately.”\n\nIf Mendoza goes to the New York Giants, McElroy sees him picking up steam much quicker.\n\n“I like the upside of Dante Moore and Fernando Mendoza better,” McElroy said. “Because I feel like the long-term prospects of those guys being super elite in the NFL feels more likely than it does with Jaxson Dart.”\n\nBut, for now, Mendoza told reporters Tuesday how much he is excited to play a storied SEC program, particularly quarterback Ty Simpson.\n\n\"I’ve seen him or heard about him for a long time now. He was one of the top guys. ... Not only was he a great quarterback, he seemed like he was a great guy. And I think everyone he’s rubbed off on whether it was his podcast with ‘Bussin with the Boys,’ I’ve always seen his personality shine through, and I think that’s why he’s such a great leader of that team in which people see he’s authentic, he’s genuine and they want to go behind him. Also as a player, he’s one of the best quarterbacks in the nation, no doubt about it.”\n\nThe Rose Bowl is set for New Year's Day (4 p.m. ET, ESPN).",

    "fullText": "Former Oregon and Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly was hired as Northwestern's offensive coordinator on Tuesday.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of the Las Vegas Raiders firing Kelly as offensive coordinator late last month after just 11 games. But he has a history of overseeing explosive offenses, particularly at the college level.\n\nKelly led Oregon to a 46-7 record and a national championship game appearance from 2009 to 2012 before spending four years as an NFL head coach — three with Philadelphia and one with San Francisco. He returned to the college ranks as UCLA’s coach from 2018-23, leading the Bruins to a 35–34 record. He was offensive coordinator at Ohio State under Ryan Day last year, helping the Buckeyes win the national championship.\n\n“This program and university are clearly on the rise, and the values of the people and this place align with my own,” he said in a statement. “I am grateful for the opportunity. There is tremendous potential under Coach Braun’s leadership, and I’m ready to contribute to this team.”\n\nKelly was the most prominent assistant hired by Pete Carroll in his first season as Las Vegas' coach after leading the Seattle Seahawks for 14 years. He reportedly received a $6 million contract, the highest for an NFL offensive coordinator. But he never lived up to the deal. Las Vegas' offense ranked among the NFL's worst when he was fired.\n\nEven so, Northwestern coach David Braun called hiring Kelly “a program-defining change” that “is reflective of our long-term commitment to the pursuit of championships\" in a statement.\n\nThe Wildcats are 19-19 in three seasons under Braun. They went 7-6 this year and beat Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl.\n\nNorthwestern is set to move into a new stadium next season after playing home games the past two years at a temporary lakefront facility and at Wrigley Field.\n\n\"This is a seminal moment for our program under David Braun’s direction and another indication that we are prepared to pursue the highest standard of excellence in all that we do,” athletic director Mark Jackson said in a statement.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "Stefon Diggs assault charges, explained: What to know about strangulation allegations against Patriots star originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots have enjoyed a dream season, with Drake Maye emerging as a potential NFL MVP, and the addition of veteran WR Stefon Diggs has been as significant a factor as any.\n\nThe Patriots took a gamble by signing Diggs to a multi-year deal fresh off an ACL tear in Houston, but the 32-year-old has rewarded New England by starting every game and serving as a steady hand in Maye's receiving corps.\n\nAs the Patriots prepare for the playoffs, criminal charges against Diggs threaten to hang over the team.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the charges Diggs is facing.\n\nNFL Week 18 picks against the spread\n\nDiggs was charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery as a result of an incident that allegedly took place on Dec. 2, Boston 25 News reported.\n\nDiggs' arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 23, though his lawyers were in court for a hearing Tuesday to try to delay the court date until March. Diggs' lawyers also asked a judge to keep the police record on the case sealed, Boston 25 News said.\n\nThe Patriots released a statement Tuesday explaining Diggs \"categorically denies the allegations\" and pledging to cooperate with authorities and the NFL:\n\n\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs. Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.”\n\nThe NFL also released a statement saying, \"We are aware of the matter and have been in contact with the club. We have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nDiggs has 970 yards and four touchdowns through 16 games this season, hauling in 82 of his 99 targets. He leads the NFL in targets, receptions and receiving yards, and he is coming off back-to-back 100-yard games.\n\nMoney is on the line for Diggs in Week 18, assuming he plays, as he is 30 yards away from a $500,000 bonus and eight catches away from another $500,000.\n\nMORE:Updated playoff picture ahead of Week 18\n\nThe details of the case, including where it allegedly took place and who might have been involved, are not yet clear. Diggs' lawyers petitioned a judge to keep the police records sealed. The judge is considering the motion.\n\nThe alleged incident took place on Dec. 2, one day after the Patriots defeated the Giants on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nDiggs was formally charged in the case, though he did not appear in court Tuesday and will not be arraigned until Jan. 23. Diggs' lawyers petitioned to move the arraignment to March, though she has not yet made a ruling.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the Matthew Stafford vs. Drake Maye MVP debate\n\nThe NFL typically waits until legal cases are resolved before issuing suspensions, which is why Kansas City Chiefs WR Rashee Rice wasn't suspended until 2025 for an incident that occurred in March 2024.\n\nAs long as that precedent stands, there isn't any reason to expect Diggs to be suspended by the league at any point this season.\n\nThe only exception could be a scenario in which Diggs is placed on the Commissioner's Exempt List, which the NFL describes as \"a special player status available to clubs only in unusual circumstances.\" Use of the Commissioner's Exempt List is rare, but it can allow a player to not count against a team's 53-man roster while facing serious criminal charges.\n\nAt this time, there is no reason to believe the NFL is considering placing Diggs on the Commissioner's Exempt List, meaning he is eligible to continue playing.\n\nThe Patriots issued a statement on Tuesday addressing the charges against Diggs:\n\n\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs. Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary.

    "description": "On an eight-game win streak, are the Texans among the top five teams in the NFL entering Saturday's afternoon bout against the Chargers?",
    "fullText": "On an eight-game win streak with victories over four potential playoff rosters, are the Houston Texans among the top three teams entering this weekend's regular-season finale?\n\nNope. Instead, it's another week of losing ground at the worst time possible.\n\nNope. Instead, Houston moves outside the top five because of a close call against a bad roster.\n\nFresh off a 20-16 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, the Texans sit at 11-5 and are officially back in the playoffs. They're still a half-game out of first place, but bolstering the league's No. 1 defense in total yards and scoring has made the case for them as perhaps the most complete roster in the AFC South.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars, who can clinch the division title on Sunday with a win over the Titans, still own the AFC South. A loss would take them out of the conversation should Houston win, but a win could clinch home-field advantage with losses by New England and Denver.\n\nAs for the Texans, even though they remain in second place for the division, they once again lost a bit of traction in Nate Davis' latest NFL power rankings for USA TODAY Sports, remaining idle at No. 7 overall.\n\n\"Now on an eight-game heater, their league-best defense − stifling, opportunistic and rude to opposing quarterbacks − should keep them in just about every game. But can an often limited offense, particularly in the run game, hold up its end of the bargain − especially if a franchise that's never reached the AFC title game winds up on the postseason road?\" Davis wrote.\n\nHouston secured an interception on Justin Herbert before halftime behind the return of Azeez Al-Shaair into the starting lineup after missing last week's game against the Las Vegas Raiders. That, along with two missed kicks from Cameron Dicker, were among the many issues that cost Los Angeles a chance as the No. 1 seed in the AFC.\n\nFor Indianapolis, its season went south after the season-ending injury to Daniel Jones. Losing six of their last seven games, the Colts were knocked out of the playoff picture following Houston's win on Saturday. They appeared at No. 21.\n\n\"Nunc Coepi, fellas … just not sure who you're beginning with next,\" Davis wrote.\n\nAcross the AFC South, the Jaguars took a step back after having a close call with the Colts. Yes, they won, but Trevor Lawrence didn't throw a touchdown pass and was limited as a runner outside of two red-zone scores.\n\n\"Why aren't they No. 1 … even though they might wind up there in the overall AFC standings? Their seven-game winning streak, most of those victories of the decisive variety, is currently second only to Houston's. The Jags are committed to the run, take the ball away and can rush the passer. But as well as QB Trevor Lawrence has played since Thanksgiving, he also remains an unproven commodity − at the professional level anyway − when it comes to January football,\" Davis wrote.\n\nAs for the Titans, they remained idle after losing late against the New Orleans Saints. For the first time this season, Cam Ward looked promising, but it was rookie Chimere Dike who earned the accolades from Davis and the Pro Bowl voters.\n\n\"Congratulations to Pro Bowl WR Chimere Dike, who's had a historic rookie season … even if he's not the rookie the Titans had hoped would have a historic season,\" Davis wrote.\n\nElsewhere around the league, the Los Angeles Rams are ranked No. 1 and the Seattle Seahawks are ranked No. 2 as the two leaders toward a Super Bowl run.

    "fullText": "BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:30 GMT). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 21:00 GMT.\n\nThere are just two places left to play for in the NFL play-offs heading into the final week of the season but plenty more to be decided, including both top seeds and four division titles.\n\nThe NFL schedulers have come up trumps as the two remaining play-off spots can be decided in two head-to-head matches.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens renew their fierce rivalry for the AFC North spot and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers need to beat the Carolina Panthers to have a chance of winning the NFC South.\n\nDenver, New England and Jacksonville could all end up as top seeds in the AFC, while the San Francisco 49ers host the Seattle Seahawks in a straight-up fight to claim top spot in the NFC.\n\nStar quarterbacks falter as 49ers eye home Super Bowl - best of week 17\n\n49ers win thriller after Browns upset Steelers - NFL week 17 recap\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (9-7) / Baltimore Ravens (8-8)\n\nThe winner of Pittsburgh against Baltimore will get the fourth seed, with division champions rewarded with a home game in the wildcard round regardless of their record.\n\nBuffalo and Los Angeles are locked in as wildcards while Houston need a win and Jacksonville defeat to jump from fifth to third.\n\nDenver will finish top seed with a win but if they lose then New England or even the Jaguars could pinch that coveted top spot.\n\nCarolina Panthers (8-8) / Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9)\n\nCarolina or Tampa Bay will get the fourth seed and home tie depending on who wins the NFC South, but there's an added wrinkle as the Panthers could lose and still claim the division depending on Atlanta's result.\n\nGreen Bay are locked in seventh and Los Angeles could still get fifth - which when you consider could be the difference between a trip to the Eagles or Panthers/Buccaneers is well worth fighting for.\n\nThat top spot match-up between Seattle and San Francisco is the highlight though, with the difference being a first-round bye and considerable home advantage or having to go on the road being huge in the play-offs.\n\nThe top seed in the NFC and AFC both get a first-round bye and home advantage throughout the play-offs.\n\nThe remaining six teams take part in Wildcard Weekend, with three division winners playing at home against three wildcard teams - the second seed playing seventh, third hosting sixth and fourth facing fifth.\n\nFrom there, the top seeds enter the fray by hosting the lowest remaining seed left, with the next highest seed at home against the next lowest seed in the Divisional Round.\n\nThe Championship games are then contested with again the highest seed remaining hosting the game - which is why finishing in top spot can be so important.\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (01:20, Monday)\n\nThese two teams really do not like each other and they have had some street fights in their time - so a bare knuckle battle for the division will be a brutal ending as the 272nd and final regular season game on the schedule.\n\nBaltimore started 1-5 and have lost three of the past five while the Steelers have been consistently inconsistent all season, yet thanks to an unusually weak division this year one side will make the post-season.\n\nAaron Rodgers almost clinched a play-off return on Sunday but the 42-year-old just couldn't find a late touchdown pass against lowly Cleveland.\n\nMissing dominant receiver DK Metcalf, suspended after an altercation with a fan, could cost Pittsburgh dear.\n\nTwo-time MVP Lamar Jackson is a doubt for Baltimore with a back injury, but running back Derrick Henry exploded for over 200 yards and four touchdowns in his last game.\n\nHenry could be the x-factor here in a straight play-in game - the winner goes to the play-offs, the loser goes home.\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers (01:00, Sunday)\n\nThe NFC West title is up for grabs but more importantly all the trappings of the top seeding as San Francisco host Seattle at Levi's Stadium - which also hosts February's Super Bowl.\n\nIt looks like attack versus defence here with the 49ers the league's top scorers since Brock Purdy returned from injury in week 11, coming off their first back-to-back 40-point games in 30 years.\n\nAnd they need it as without star defenders Fred Warner and Nick Bosa they've also been leaking points - as witnessed during their wild shootout win over Chicago on Sunday.\n\nSeattle's defence is the second best in the NFL with just over 18 points a game allowed and the team moved to 7-1 on the road this season after smothering Carolina on Sunday - allowing Bryce Young to pass for just 54 yards.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is the only man ever to have successive 13-win seasons with two different teams, but he leads the league with 20 turnovers after an interception and fumble in Carolina.\n\nDarnold was in this position last season with Minnesota, but lost in Detroit before having a play-off nightmare against the Rams. He needs to avoid sloppy turnovers to avoid a repeat.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21:30 Saturday)\n\nBaker Mayfield was in the early MVP race but the Buccaneers have fallen off a cliff since with four straight defeats making it seven losses in eight games.\n\nCarolina have also fluffed their lines though when given the chance, so one team will stumble over the line - and not much will be expected of either in the play-offs.\n\nFor the Panthers it is a win-and-in game as victory will book a play-off spot, but not for Tampa Bay as even if Carolina lose they will still take the division if Atlanta beat New Orleans.\n\nThat's because wins for the Bucs and Falcons would see all three teams finish on 8-9 - the first three-way division tie since 2011 - and Carolina hold the best record in head-to-head matches.\n\nTennessee Titans @ Jacksonville Jaguars (18:00, Sunday)\n\nMiami Dolphins @ New England Patriots (21:25, Sunday)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Denver Broncos (21:25, Sunday)\n\nDenver should really get the job done here as Chargers boss Jim Harbaugh has already said he will rest quarterback Justin Herbert and any other starters that need it with a wildcard the best they can do.\n\nThe Broncos have the tiebreaker edge on the Patriots so just need to win, but should Denver stumble, New England can bag top spot with a win over Miami.\n\nJacksonville need to beat the Titans, as they should, and have the Broncos and Patriots both lose to claim an unlikely top seed.\n\nThe Jags will just have to focus on victory though, as they could suffer a big trapdoor fall if they suffer an upset defeat with Houston waiting in the wings.\n\nA Jacksonville loss and Houston victory will give the Texans the AFC South title, third seed and a home play-off tie with the Jags hitting the road as a wildcard.\n\nAll three sides are big favourites to win so things really should stay as they are, but funny things can happen in the NFL.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21:30)\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers (01:00, Sunday)\n\nNew Orleans Saints @ Atlanta Falcons (18:00)\n\nCleveland Browns @ Cincinnati Bengals (18:00)\n\nGreen Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings (18:00)\n\nDallas Cowboys @ New York Giants (18:00)\n\nTennessee Titans @ Jacksonville Jaguars (18:00)\n\nIndianapolis Colts @ Houston Texans (18:00)\n\nNew York Jets @ Buffalo Bills (21:25)\n\nMiami Dolphins @ New England Patriots (21:25)\n\nDetroit Lions @ Chicago Bears (21:25)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Denver Broncos (21:25)\n\nKansas City Chiefs @ Las Vegas Raiders (21:25)\n\nArizona Cardinals @ Los Angeles Rams (21:25)\n\nWashington Commanders @ Philadelphia Eagles (21:25)\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (01:20, Monday)",

    "description": "Notre Dame football got great news on Monday as head coach Marcus Freeman won’t entertain NFL offers, and here are the top social media reactions.",
    "fullText": "It was a huge Monday for Notre Dame football, as head coach Marcus Freeman turned down the NFL to stay in South Bend.\n\nThere were multiple rumors about teams going after the Irish head coach, especially after the disappointing end to the year with missing the College Football Playoff. In the end, Freeman never reportedly took an interview and will continue his quest to win a championship for Notre Dame.\n\nIt can’t be understated how huge this news is, as Freeman has turned the program into what many thought he couldn’t, a perennial national championship contender. Last year was proof the Irish are close, and hopefully this season is motivation for 2026.\n\nAs social media always does, it was quick to react to the news. Here are some of the top reactions to Notre Dame retaining Marcus Freeman for at least another season.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL franchises that had been in communication with him about their jobs that he was staying at Notre Dame, sources tell Sports Illustrated pic.twitter.com/UHJV3WV7rV\n\n— Sports Illustrated (@SInow) December 29, 2025\n\nInteresting that it was multiple teams that went after Freeman, as it was only really known that the New York Giants were interested. Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde had at least one other team who saw him as a good fit for their organization.\n\nA win for college football https://t.co/xF2VfL08AE\n\n— J.D. PicKell (@jdpickell) December 29, 2025\n\nCollege football won today, keeping one of its best away from the professional ranks. Notre Dame clearly is the biggest winner here, but this move sends waves across the top-levels of the game.\n\nMarcus Freeman off the market for NFL teams ... https://t.co/hsJrl3gWDa\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) December 29, 2025\n\nWas there ever really a true market for Freeman, anyone could say that they were interested. You have to wonder how he’ll react if he’s asked about this in a future press conference.\n\nSources confirm coach Marcus Freeman will be back at Notre Dame for the 2026 season and will receive an enhanced contract with the school, as athletic director Pete Bevacqua indicated earlier this month. @ByPatForde first reported.\n\n— Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) December 29, 2025\n\nWorth every penny. Give Freeman a blank check. Don’t let him leave South Bend.\n\nTHE GOAT IS BACK LETS RIDE COACH!!! https://t.co/J7BGjfEJZ8\n\n— ☘️ (@WeAreNDFans) December 29, 2025\n\nThis might be a bit of an overreaction, but getting Freeman back is huge for the 2026 season. He’s the driving force behind the program and will have a loaded team next fall.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL teams that had been in contact with him about their head-coaching openings that he’s staying at Notre Dame, sources told Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde 👀 Natty incoming 2026?\n\n— Talia Baia (@talia_baia) December 29, 2025\n\nGet used to it, as long as Freeman is in South Bend, this is the new normal. Notre Dame should continue to contend for championships and should be one of the few teams that can actually win-it-all next fall.\n\nGreat move by Freeman and ND to shutdown the NFL talk so quickly.\n\nI remember the Brian Kelly to NFL talk after the national championship game run lingered for a long time (Kelly made no secret he was actively interested).\n\nIt really killed our momentum in recruiting & retention.\n\n— G'Irish Talk 🎙️ (@GIrish_Talk) December 29, 2025\n\nWith the transfer portal season coming up, having stability at the head coaching position is huge, and Notre Dame now has that. Players won’t have to worry if Freeman will leave after the window closes, as he’s already announced his return.\n\nI ask myself that every day, but I think his time at Notre Dame is not going to be much longer. Two offseasons in a row he's shown some level of interest in other jobs, mainly in the NFL. Even more so this offseason. If ND is as good as I think they will be in 2026, could be his…\n\n— Bryan Driskell (@CoachD178) December 29, 2025\n\nDriskell is one of the best on the Notre Dame beat, and hopefully his gut is wrong. You can’t deny his read on the situation, it has been back-to-back off-seasons dealing with Freeman potentially heading off to the NFL. Time will tell what ends up happening, but what we know now is that he’ll be coaching Notre Dame next fall.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Social media reacts to Marcus Freeman staying with Notre Dame for 2026",

    "fullText": "With the Buffalo Bills’ one-point loss on Sunday to the Philadelphia Eagles, the New England Patriots were crowned the champions of the AFC East.\n\nThis snapped a franchise record of five consecutive division championships for Buffalo.\n\nWith this streak snapped, the Bills became owners of a new NFL record.\n\nThe Bills became the first team in NFL history to win five or more consecutive division titles and not make a Super Bowl appearance during their run.\n\nThere are only five other franchises in the Super Bowl era to have ever won their division five or more years in a row.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings’ “Purple People Eaters” won the NFC Central six seasons in a row, spanning from 1973 to 1978. Like Buffalo, Minnesota has never won a Super Bowl. However, during this time, the Vikings made appearances in 1974, 1975, and 1977.\n\nThen there was the Pittsburgh Steelers’ “Steel Curtain.” This iteration of the Steelers won their division from 1974 to 1979. They appeared in and won four Super Bowls during those six years.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams held the record for most consecutive divisional titles for 30 years after winning seven in a row starting in 1973. These Rams’ seasons usually ended in a conference championship loss to one of the other teams on this list, but they did manage to make one Super Bowl in the final year of their run.\n\nMost recently, we have the Kansas City Chiefs, whose failure to win the AFC West this season ended their stab at the Patriots’ record. The Chiefs made five Super Bowls during their nine-year reign atop the division, winning three.\n\nBut none compares to New England’s NFL record 11-year division title streak starting in 2009 and ending when Buffalo claimed its first.\n\nThe Patriots appeared in eight straight AFC Conference Championship Games, made five Super Bowl appearances and lifted three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nDrake Maye Boasts ‘It’s Harder To Light Me Up Than You Think’",

    "description": "Will the ax fall on Kevin Stefanski, Mike McDaniel or Shane Steichen? We'll know the day after the 2025 NFL regular season wraps.",
    "fullText": "For 18 teams, the 2026 NFL season begins once Week 18 ends. For a select few, that means leaving losing coaches behind and starting fresh. While there are always a handful of firings across the course of the season — this year that included Tennessee Titans play-caller Brian Callahan and New York Giants former NFL coach of the year Brian Daboll — there's no worse day to be a struggling NFL coach than the day after the season is finished.\n\nBlack Monday is the scourge of underperforming playbook architects. It will claim a handful of careers to ring in the new year January 5, opening the door to coaching interviews and new hires that will energize fan bases across the world — though whether that's a good thing or bad thing will hinge heavily on the candidate. So who could be the recipient of bad headlines the first day after the 2025 NFL regular season ends?\n\nGlenn should be at the top of this list, but New York's reported insistence it will keep him suggests he's safe barring an absolute disaster in Week 18. We cannot rule this out, because absolute disaster has been a hallmark of Glenn's first season as an NFL head coach.\n\nHe started his tenure with seven straight losses. Somehow, the four-game losing streak in which he's currently mired feels worse; his Jets have been outscored by an average margin of just under 27 points per game — and that includes showdowns with sub-.500 teams like the Dolphins and New Orleans Saints. Injuries and trades have depleted both sides of the ball, but you'd be hard pressed to find anything New York does well in 2025.\n\nJustin Fields, Glenn's flier QB addition, has been either injured or terrible this fall. Garrett Wilson's injury turned the receiving corps into a host of replacement-caliber players. None of the team's three starting wideouts in Week 17 began their season on the Jets' active roster. Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams were traded in-season. Qwan'tez Stiggers, Dean Clark and Jarvis Brownlee have all made multiple starts in the secondary — a group that has yet to record an interception this fall.\n\nKeeping Glenn suggests owner Woody Johnson is chalking a brutal 2025 up to an undermanned depth chart and some bad personnel decisions. Still, it's tough to look at the Jets defense and its massive regression from Robert Saleh's peak and think Glenn has the ability to map out a cogent plan as the season wears on and the world changes around him.\n\nHe's set to get another try with multiple first round draft picks and more than $90 million in salary cap room for 2026. Failing there could set the Jets up for another generation of regret.\n\nStefanski is Cleveland's Sisyphus, only if management stepped in to give him a larger, heavier boulder after he'd cleared the halfway point of his mountain. The coach who guided Baker Mayfield to the franchise's first playoff win since 1994 and won 11 games by making Joe Flacco the NFL comeback player of the year (in just six games) has been constantly hamstrung by his franchise's inability to find a viable quarterback.\n\nCleveland traded three first round picks before handing Deshaun Watson a fully guaranteed $230 million despite more than 20 accusations of sexual misconduct and what the NFL itself described as \"predatory behavior\" dating to his time in Houston. For the privilege of blocking the team's most obvious pathways to roster improvement, Watson has played 19 games in four seasons and been the NFL's 48th-best quarterback when on the field.\n\nHis absence has cleared the way for the Browns to improve from 32nd in scoring offense last season to... 31st. The offensive line, once a strength, has devolved into one of the league's worst units. Bright spots remain thanks to Quinshon Judkins and Harold Fannin Jr., but there may not be a coach alive or dead who could coax this team to a respectable record.\n\nAfter that playoff win in his debut, Stefanski has had a losing record in four of the last five seasons. He deserves better. Cleveland firing him could clear him up to actually receive it. Expecting the Browns to do better with his replacement, however, is a tough ask.\n\nMorris got the Atlanta job over Bill Belichick. While he's been better (and less of a circus) than the nine-time Super Bowl winner has at North Carolina, he hasn't inspired confidence. Somehow, remarkably, Morris found a way to beat the Buffalo Bills but lose to the New York Jets — threading a needle that completes the world's tackiest jacket.\n\nQuarterback play has been an issue, with Michael Penix Jr.'s injury giving way to a diminished Kirk Cousins and spurts of inspiring play cropping up like islands in a sea of mediocrity. Atlanta has a galaxy of high level skill players, but thanks to injury and ineffectiveness ranks only 22nd in expected points added (EPA) per play this fall. Pouring draft capital into the pass rush has improved the defense, but that unit has gone from 20th in EPA allowed to... 19th.\n\nOutside help will be difficult to find. Releasing or trading Cousins would shave up to $35 million from the team's 2026 salary cap — useful, considering it's already over the estimated spending limit next fall — but may not be practical with Penix recovering from his third ACL tear. The team's first round pick is owed to the Los Angeles Rams as a result of the trade that made James Pearce a Falcon (he was drafted with the 26th overall selection. Atlanta's pick is shaping up to land in or around the top 10. It's not ideal!).\n\nThat could give Morris one more chance to clean up the mess he's maintained for the past two seasons. If he can fix the defense and lean on guys like Drake London and Bijan Robinson on offense, it could be enough to rise to the top of the NFC South's shallow pool. The help will have to mostly come from within the franchise. With a still-young core, the opportunity for a turnaround will persist. So far, Morris has proven incapable of seizing it.\n\nHow much of the Colts' injury-related crashout will be heaped at the feet of Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard? Indianapolis was once 7-1. Now it's at risk of finishing 2025 with a losing record.\n\nSteichen and Ballard came into the year on the hot seat, emerged as potential award winners over the first half of the season and then shrank from the spotlight as things went sour. Injuries to Daniel Jones and Anthony Richardson didn't help, but that doesn't explain a defense that ranked 10th in expected points added (EPA) per play allowed in the first half of the season slid to 23rd in the second half. Sure, a rise of three-and-outs from an offense eventually commandeered by a 44-year-old Philip Rivers didn't help. Even so, that's a dramatic backslide for a team that held three opponents to 14 points or fewer through Week 8 and has held a single opponent to fewer than 20 points in the nine weeks since.\n\nThe Colts are heading into their first full offseason without former owner Jim Irsay at the helm in four decades. Current principal owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon and her sisters have been raised in a football world and understand the big swings he took to make Indianapolis great for a long stretch (and bad-to-mediocre for a longer one). Would they opt for a clean break to start fresh this January? Or did Jones' revival and subsequent injury create enough plausible deniability to run it back next fall?\n\nInjury luck has been unkind to Gannon, certainly. But it doesn't excuse the fact he's won 30 percent of his games in Arizona over nearly three full seasons. With Kyler Murray shut down for the season (officially due to a foot injury, but unofficially because he was uninspiring and lacked the efficiency and consistency of, big sigh, Jacoby Brissett), the Cardinals have lost eight straight games. Despite a 3-13 record, they may not wind up with a top-three draft pick from it thanks to the league's hardest strength of schedule.\n\nEven without a top-two pick in a two-quarterback draft (we'll see how the spring workouts shake out for Ty Simpson et al), we may have seen the end of the Murray era in Arizona. The former first overall pick has played more than 11 games only once in his last four seasons. His 0.084 EPA per dropback ranks 23rd among 53 quarterbacks to play at least 500 snaps in that stretch, which isn't terrible but also hasn't resulted in success. The Cardinals haven't had a winning season since 2021.\n\nTrading away Murray would create more than $35 million in salary cap savings and a clean slate for a team unable to get out of its own way. Would Arizona trust a new franchise quarterback to the head coach who engineered a top-three offense in Philadelphia to get the job, then built the league's 17th-best offense in the three years that followed? While Gannon coaxed another forgettably solid year out of Brissett, his lack of wins suggests the ceiling for another veteran QB wouldn't be much higher in 2026.\n\nMcDaniel has been able to make more from less, turning around a team that looked absolutely cooked to start the season (1-6) en route to a .500-ish record. That's happened without Tyreek Hill in the lineup and followed the benching of Tua Tagovailoa. Rookie seventh round pick Quinn Ewers may not be the team's future, but McDaniel installed an offense around him that allowed him to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 17 to further dim the Bucs' Super Bowl hopes.\n\nThat's all encouraging. It does not change the fact McDaniel failed to make Tagovailoa more than a fantasy football star, an 0-2 playoff record or a 9-14 record in December or later. The unconventional head coach has done a great job adding a slick layer of sheen atop his franchise that begins to flake apart under modest scrutiny. He's had one season with a top 20 scoring defense. He hasn't cracked the top 20 in scoring offense either of the last two years.\n\nLike Gannon above, McDaniel's franchise is on the verge of swapping out a once-touted, highly paid and since-benched quarterback in service of a fresh start. But Tagovailoa's contract, injury history and the smoldering crater his 2025 play created makes him considerably more difficult to trade and there's nearly $100 million worth of dead salary attached to the $212 million extension he signed in (deep exhale) 2024. Miami isn't bad enough to land a top prospect on an inexpensive salary in the draft. Its best option may be hoping for a Sam Darnold or Baker Mayfield-type revival from a journeyman veteran.\n\nThat could benefit McDaniel, who supercharged Tagovailoa just long enough to be an albatross around the team's neck and just won a game with a seventh round rookie behind center. McDaniel's place in Kyle Shanahan's coaching tree suggests a special appreciation for getting the most out of flawed passers. But four seasons of underwhelming returns and no playoff success to speak of may shuffle him back to the coordinator ranks for a few years instead.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: 6 NFL coaches on the hot seat for Black Monday",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Matthew Stafford reached a career milestone, though his three interceptions hurt the Rams' chances of winning a game and perhaps his own of winning the NFL's MVP.\n\nStafford set a career high in touchdown passes in a season with 42 when he hit Puka Nakua for an 11-yard score with 2:46 to play, but the Falcons answered with a 51-yard field goal with 21 seconds left and upset the Rams 27-24 on Monday night.\n\nStafford was 22 for 38 for 269 yards with two touchdowns and a season-high three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown. It was the quarterback's first three-interception game since Week 1 of the 2022 season.\n\n“He’s a total stud,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “We wouldn’t be in a lot of the great situations we’re in without him. But tonight was, it was a night that he’s capable of playing better.”\n\nStafford helped rally the Rams from a 24-3 second-half deficit to tie the score at 24 on his scoring toss to Nakua. His first touchdown was a 27-yard pass to Terrence Ferguson in the third quarter that pulled the Rams within 24-10.\n\nStafford was also sacked three times, which matched a season high, but didn't feel like the Falcons' pressure was overwhelming.\n\n“Every week is a new challenge,\" Stafford said. \"Just because you play good one week doesn’t mean you’re going to play good the next, and vice versa. So just got to go out there and continue to trust what we’ve done all year, and then we got to just show up and make the plays on game day.”\n\nStafford’s previous high for touchdowns in a season was 41, which he accomplished twice. He had 41 in 2011 with the Lions and in 2021 with the Rams.\n\nStafford was the betting favorite to win the first MVP award of his 17-year career ahead of Patriots second-year quarterback Drake Maye. On Sunday, Maye had a near-perfect afternoon against the Jets, presumably closing the gap on Stafford. Maye was 19 for 21 for 256 yards and five touchdowns in New York as the Patriots rolled to a 42-10 win. He played the first six possessions of the game and led the Patriots to six touchdowns.\n\nStafford is averaging 278 passing yards per game to Maye's 262.7, has 42 passing TDs to Maye's 30 and the quarterbacks are even with eight interceptions apiece. Maye's big day against the Jets pulled him virtually even with Stafford in passer rating prior to the Falcons game. Maye also has 409 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns while Stafford has -2 rushing yards and no rushing touchdowns on the season. Maye's completion percentage, which leads the NFL, is 71.7 to Stafford's 65.2 (18th).\n\nThe Patriots clinched the AFC East on Sunday and enter Week 18 with a 13-3 record, while Stafford's Rams are 11-5 and will enter the playoffs as a wild card. The Patriots will close the regular season at home against the Dolphins and still have a shot at the No. 1 seed in the AFC, so Maye figures to play. Los Angeles will host the Arizona Cardinals and McVay said Monday his starters will play.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Finding the best fits for mid-round quarterbacks in the 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe story of the 2026 NFL Draft's quarterback class will be defined by its thinning at the top. Fernando Mendoza is the odds-on favorite to go 1.01. If he declares, Oregon's Dante Moore shouldn't last much longer. But this isn't the class the football world was sold, and teams' actions early in the offseason will reflect that.\n\nInstead, we are left with an unsteady crop of quarterbacks, many of whom decided to return to school. The seniors that aren't afforded that option are headed to the league with less hype than the summer suggested and little expectations of rookie-year playing time.\n\nIn an NFL era that has rendered the Day 2 quarterback an endangered species, several passers may fall into Day 3. While that has consequences for their rookie contracts, it could also open the door for more competitive teams offering a promising path to development.\n\nGarrett Nussmeier, LSU: Arizona Cardinals\n\nA Day 2 option that I've penciled into prior mock drafts is Nussmeier heading to the desert. It may not come as early as initially anticipated, but there's reason to believe that both parties could benefit from a fresh start.\n\nKyler Murray has proven he isn't the answer in Arizona. He may return for one last stand, but at some point, the Cardinals will need a new option under center. Unlike the out-of-structure prowess that Murray enjoys, Nussmeier projects more like a game manager. Similar to Jacoby Brissett, Nussmeier can win pre-snap and run the offense as it's intended, opening up the middle of the field and feeding receivers with more consistent targets.\n\nThe Cardinals prefer Brissett's style to Murray. Opting for Nussmeier provides a similar skill set with more credibility as a long-term option.\n\nNussmeier dealt with an injury to his midsection and wasn't quite as polished in 2025. As the floor drops on his stock, Arizona can take a shot on a new passer without wasting resources on a potential first-round prospect in 2027.\n\nJohn Mateer, Oklahoma: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nThe Buccaneers have been beneficiaries of Baker Mayfield's career resurgence. Unfortunately for Tampa, his step back has left them closer to quarterback purgatory than they would like to admit.\n\nI'm lower than most on Mayfield, but this isn't an indictment on his status as next year's quarterback. He'll likely return and do so with the optimism of a healthier squad (and probably a new head coach). We know that this offense can work around Mayfield's measurable shortcomings, and living with his volatility has been a welcome part of the experience. Thus, a pivot to Mateer in April makes sense.\n\nMORE: Cole Payton gives Senior Bowl a small-school boost at quarterback\n\nMateer wouldn't start right away, but his similarities to Mayfield make him a viable backup in this offense and provide the Buccaneers with an off-ramp if contract talks get messy.\n\nMateer needs development before he starts on Sundays. He's more comfortable out of structure than inside it, draws pressure on himself in the pocket, and can be too reliant on his legs. Still, that mobility should amplify a below-average backfield in ways that Mayfield's scrambling has not.\n\nAt Oklahoma, Mateer's play style and moxie made him the Sooners' spiritual successor to Mayfield. He could have a similar opportunity in a perpetually-winnable NFC South.\n\nCarson Beck, Miami: Indianapolis Colts\n\nIndianapolis has created a special kind of catastrophe. Daniel Jones seems likely to return, albeit off an Achilles and not necessarily ready for Week 1. With limited mobility, he's a tough passer to trust. An orbital fracture further curtailed Anthony Richardson's development. I don't know what the Year 4 version of him looks like, and after his historically poor performances in 2024, I'm not sure I (nor Shane Steichen) want to find out.\n\nThe Colts don't have the ammo to take an early-round passer, either. This is a room that, as currently constructed, has one of the lowest floors in football.\n\nIndianapolis needs a polished passer who can keep Steichen's offense on the tracks and do enough for the ground game to churn out victories. Early on Day 3, Miami's Carson Beck might be the best bet to do so.\n\nDespite flashing early in the year (and entering the 2025 cycle as the preseason QB1), Beck profiles as a backup who has more present-day competence than long-term upside. He's played a lot of college ball against premium competition and has enough tools to trust with playing time. Throw in the allure of Steichen's wizardry and squint hard enough, and Beck is a low-risk dice roll of getting the Colts out of this mess.\n\nDrew Allar, Penn State: Detroit Lions\n\nIt was a nightmare season for everyone in Happy Valley, none more than Drew Allar.\n\nOnce a first-round hopeful, Allar began the cycle as a Day 2 option with enough upside to get Round 1 looks. He struggled in 2025, and an ankle injury ended his college career.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty in this profile. His broken ankle could dampen his athleticism, limit a skill-set that wasn't particularly twitchy, or keep him from getting crucial reps for his intangible development. He could also be fine! But no longer is Allar a polarizing passer for teams to take at a discount.\n\nAllar never proved he could cash in on his elite physical traits, even with Penn State's army of top recruits. Now, he enters the league without a real platform year and injury concerns headlining his profile.\n\nAllar needs to land on a team with a strong offensive infrastructure and no demand to play in Year 1. Few teams check those boxes like the Detroit Lions. Jared Goff isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and it doesn't make sense to move him until after the 2026 season, regardless of his performance.\n\nYet, the Lions' window is closing fast, and as Super Bowl aspirations shrink, patience for Goff will follow. There's a world in which the 2027 Lions are led by another quarterback, leaving at least one season for Allar to get healthy and develop in the incubator of Detroit's offense. Armed with an elite ground game, quality receivers, and a good young coach, Allar makes about as much sense on paper as a Day 3 project can get.\n\nCole Payton, North Dakota State: Carolina Panthers\n\nThere's a fog of war that comes with evaluating NDSU talents. The talent gap between the Bison and their competition is as fierce as any in college football, and their NFL quarterbacks have reflected that uncertainty. Carson Wentz was an MVP favorite who quickly became a castaway. Easton Stick never stuck, and Trey Lance will start in Week 18 on his third team in as many years.\n\nPayton doesn't have to follow any of those paths, but the pre-draft circuit will be crucial in selling himself to NFL evaluators.\n\nThe Panthers can't get away with drafting a quarterback in Round 1, especially if they win in Week 18 and get to host a playoff game. That doesn't change their circumstances under center, where Young has taken a bumpy road to below average.\n\nEventually, Carolina will look to move off of Young and the limitations of being the league's shortest passer. Payton offers an imposing frame as a rusher and surplus arm talent, earning him some looks as a potential starter. Sitting behind Young gives him a chance to learn under quarterback guru Dave Canales, and if he gets a chance to play, that same volatility could serve the Panthers well.\n\nIf Payton starts and plays well, Carolina can strike gold and justify moving on from Young. If the jump from NDSU to the NFL is too large for Payton to clear, he might be bad enough to get the Panthers a top pick. In either scenario, he's unlikely to set the career mark for lowest yards per completion, unlike Carolina's current quarterback.\n\nEmmett Johnson scouting report: Nebraska's back makes case for RB2\n\nTop prospects the Kansas City Chiefs can pick after Patrick Mahomes' injury\n\nArch Manning's NFL Draft decision means doubling down on Texas\n\nLaNorris Sellers' 2026 NFL Draft decision leaves more questions than answers",

    "description": "Week 18 is upon us, which means Black Sunday and Monday are, too. Here are the names to know on the coaching hot seat as the NFL regular season draws to a close.",
    "fullText": "We’ve made it to Week 18 in the NFL season, which means we’re only days away from Black Sunday and Monday, the colloquial term for all the head coach firings that inevitably take place once the season ends.\n\nTwo head coaches, the Tennessee Titans’ Brian Callahan and the New York Giants’ Brian Daboll, have already lost their jobs. How many more will join them?\n\nWe’re taking the temperature of the coaches on or approaching the hot seat all week./\n\nRecord with team: 2-14, first season\n\nWhy he might get fired: Carroll was supposed to bring stability to the franchise, but it’s been more losing under the 74-year-old former Super Bowl winner. The Raiders haven’t won since Week 6, the offseason trade for Carroll’s preferred QB Geno Smith hasn’t yielded much, the offensive and special teams coordinators were both fired in November, and now there’s a dispute with Maxx Crosby over the star pass rusher being placed on injured reserve. None of this reflects well on Carroll, who may be in over his head trying to fix a franchise where the rot goes much deeper (and higher).\n\nWhy he might be safe: There was a reason Carroll was hired. He is almost 40 games over .500 for his NFL career, and that’s counting this season’s debacle. Also, Mark Davis has paid out a lot of money for failed coaches over the past few years and maybe he doesn’t want to shell out for Carroll too. Still, it’s hard to find a great reason to stick with Carroll, given hiss age and the Raiders’ need of an organization-wide reset.\n\nRecord with team: 45-58 (including playoffs), sixth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Browns are headed for a fourth losing record in six years under Stefanski, as well as a second straight year picking in the top-five of the draft. The cataclysmic Deshaun Watson trade is partly on Stefanski, who recruited him in the spring of 2022, and for all of Stefanski’s offensive acumen, none of the 13 (!) quarterbacks who’ve started under his watch has proven to be the long-term solution.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Stefanski has done quite a bit with limited talent, especially on offense, and team owner Jimmy Haslam might give him a chance to actually develop a highly drafted QB. Stefanski has also been to the playoffs twice and maintains a steady demeanor, win or lose. He has won NFL Coach of the Year twice, and it’s not like this would be an attractive opening for this cycle’s top candidates.\n\nRecord with team: 14-18, second season (this stint)\n\nWhy he might get fired: Morris hasn’t been flat-out bad, but the Falcons have regressed this season and the overall operation feels shaky under his watch. While he might end up a fall guy alongside general manager Terry Fontenot, who oversaw an all-in 2025 that included trading away the team’s first-round pick next spring, Morris also hasn’t made a strong case for himself.\n\nWhy he might be safe: As mentioned above, the Falcons’ current mess is more on Fontenot. That doesn’t mean Morris is blameless — the McVay tree magic that Atlanta doubtlessly sought by bringing him in along with offensive coordinator Zac Robinson hasn’t materialized — but it also means team owner Arthur Blank might give him another year.\n\nRecord with team: 15-35, third season\n\nWhy he might get fired: Gannon was hired in part to toughen up Arizona’s defense, and that hasn’t really happened. This year’s unit is 26th in EPA per play allowed, 27th in success rate allowed, and in general hasn’t taken a step forward despite 17 of Gannon’s 28 draft picks being on that side of the ball, including six of seven last spring. It’s hard to say the Cardinals are demonstrably better than they were when Gannon was hired.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Kyler Murray is the biggest question lingering over the franchise, and Gannon might be winning more with better QB play. Perhaps team owner Michael Bidwill gives him a chance to prove it. He did have the Cardinals on an upward trajectory through his first two seasons.\n\nRecord with team: 34-32 (including playoffs), fourth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The story of the McDaniel era (thus far) is starting with a bang and petering out, both in the micro and macro. He made the playoffs his first two seasons (including a hallowed 70 burger against the Broncos), but lost six of the last seven in 2022 and four of his last six in 2023. Since then, his motion-heavy, speed-oriented offense has been less effective against the league as a whole, and off-field issues (including players reportedly running out defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who won a Super Bowl with the Eagles last season) suggest McDaniel doesn’t have much command of the locker room.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Tua Tagovailoa’s limitations and concussion concerns have limited the Dolphins, and if they don’t bring him back next season, the salary cap hit would be so big that team owner Stephen Ross might decide it’s worth keeping McDaniel around one more year to get out from under it.\n\nRecord with team: 3-13, first season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Jets have been largely non-competitive, and that’s not what anyone expected in Glenn’s first season. He earned respect as a Pro Bowl player and the Lions’ defensive coordinator the past few seasons, but the Jets’ defense has regressed, the quarterback play has been bad, and the Jets were big-time sellers at the trade deadline. Justin Fields was benched in November and defensive coordinator Steve Wilks was fired in December. There aren’t many more heads to roll here.\n\nWhy he might be safe: At the league meetings in October, team owner Woody Johnson was candid that the Jets’ problems were at QB, not with Glenn. That carries a lot of weight, and Johnson’s stance reportedly hasn’t changed. The Jets also have five first-round draft picks the next two drafts, and there’s ample opportunity for Glenn to reshape the franchise in his image.\n\nRecord with team: 193-123 (including playoffs), 18th season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Ravens have been surprisingly mediocre this season, and it can’t all be attributed to Lamar Jackson’s injuries. Their defense has yo-yo’d between outright bad and competent, and some of Harbaugh’s in-game decisions have drawn scrutiny. Harbaugh has failed to get back to the Super Bowl with a two-time MVP quarterback in Jackson, and there’s a general sense that a breath of fresh air at head coach might be good for the Ravens.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Harbaugh has had only two losing seasons, and the stability he brings the organization is valuable. If he’s not back, it won’t be because he became a bad coach overnight.\n\nRecord with team: 200-125-2 (including playoffs), 19th season\n\nWhy he might get fired: A few weeks ago, fans were chanting “Fire Tomlin” during a blowout loss to the Bills. Then the Steelers took control over the AFC North and all was forgotten. But a loss to the 4-12 Browns, when Pittsburgh had a shot to clinch the division, forced a winner-take-all game against the Ravens in Week 18. Would a loss in that game, and no playoff berth, restart the talk about the Steelers and Tomlin both needing fresh starts?\n\nWhy he might be safe: Tomlin is a very good coach and to the chagrin of many Steelers fans, has had unending support from ownership. The Steelers value continuity, so they wouldn’t make a rash decision on Tomlin’s future. And it seems even more unlikely they’d make a move if the Steelers win the AFC North in the season finale.\n\nRecord with team: 35-35, fourth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Buccaneers went on a long losing streak, dropping seven of eight and losing control of a weak NFC South. The Bucs’ downturn came as they got healthier, which was confusing. There were some bad losses, and for a coach without a great career record, maybe there isn’t a reason to believe things will be decidedly better in 2026.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Bowles did lead the Buccaneers to three division titles in his first three seasons, albeit in a mediocre NFC South. And the Buccaneers are still alive to win the division this season, even though they’re 7-9. Teams usually don’t fire coaches after making the playoffs, even if it comes with a losing record.\n\nRecord with team: 57-64-1, seventh season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Bengals have missed the playoffs three straight seasons in Joe Burrow’s prime. Some of that can be attributed to Burrow’s injuries, but the Bengals’ deficiencies in protecting Burrow have contributed to his injuries. And the team around Burrow, particularly the defense, hasn’t been very good in a few years. Burrow expressed earlier this season that he wasn’t having fun, and while he has not pinned that on Taylor, the Bengals need to figure out what changes need to be made to keep Burrow happy.\n\nWhy he might be safe: One run to the Super Bowl is doing a lot of the heavy lifting on Taylor’s résumé. That came back during the 2021 season. But that has carried the reputation of the Bengals being annual contenders in the AFC, if Burrow could just stay healthy. Also, this is the Bengals, and they’re not going to want to pay someone who isn’t coaching for them anymore.\n\nWhy he might not get the job: It’s hard to point to the Giants’ record after Kafka replaced Brian Daboll and get excited. He has fired defensive coordinator Shane Bowen and assistant defensive line coach Bryan Cox since taking over, which is the type of chaos that doesn’t look great on an interim coach either.\n\nWhy he might get the job: Kafka has been mentioned as a future head coaching candidate in previous years, for his work as an offensive coordinator. And while the team’s record hasn’t been good, there have been close losses to good teams in that stretch.\n\nWhy he might not get the job: It was a forced arrangement after the team realized Brian Callahan needed to be fired. McCoy at least had some head-coaching experience. Hiring an interim who has put together a 2-8 record wouldn’t go over well with the fanbase.\n\nWhy he might get the job: Give McCoy this much: The Titans have played better late in the season, even if it hasn’t resulted in many wins. But it would be stunning if the Titans settled on McCoy after another miserable season.",

    "fullText": "Marcus Freeman makes final decision on Notre Dame return in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIn a significant win for Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Marcus Freeman has turned down multiple NFL head coaching opportunities to remain in South Bend.\n\nFreeman reportedly informed at least two NFL franchises Monday morning that he would stay at Notre Dame. The university later confirmed Freeman has agreed to a restructured contract. While financial terms were not disclosed, Freeman’s compensation now likely ranks in the top tier nationally. The revised agreement adds an additional year to his existing deal, extending his contract through the 2031 season.\n\nDespite strong NFL interest, including from the New York Giants, Freeman’s decision centered on alignment with Notre Dame leadership. He enjoys coaching at the college level and a belief the ND program is positioned to compete for a national championship in 2026.\n\n— Marcus Freeman (@Marcus_Freeman1) December 29, 2025\n\nNotre Dame is coming off a 10-2 season in which it missed the College Football Playoff, with both losses coming by a combined four points to playoff teams. A year earlier, the Irish went 14-2 and played in the national championship game. Freeman also collected multiple national honors in 2024, including the Paul “Bear” Bryant Award, the Dodd Trophy and the George Munger Award.\n\nThe Irish are expected to return a talented roster, highlighted by a young defense, a consensus top-five recruiting class and returning starting quarterback CJ Carr. Notre Dame will carry a 10-game winning streak into next season.\n\nFreeman, who turns 40 in January, owns a 43-12 record at Notre Dame and ranks among the most successful coaches under 40 in college football history.\n\nMichigan’s Biff Poggi warns up to 25 players may not return after Christmas break\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nWhy Diego Pavia attorneys are fighting the NCAA for seventh year of eligibility",

    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles have opened as 7.5-point home favorites against the Washington Commanders in Week 18, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nWe’ve yet to learn of the Eagles’ official intentions when it comes to playing starters or not but this line seems to suggest they’re not just going to fold with the No. 2 seed potentially available to them. Or maybe it’s about the Birds’ backups being able to beat Washington anyway.\n\nElsewhere of interest to the Eagles, the Chicago Bears are just 1.5-point home favorites against the Detroit Lions in Week 18. Surprised the Bears aren’t favored by more since they have motivation to win to secure the No. 2 seed and the Lions have already been eliminated from playoff contention. Seems like the odds-makers are expecting Dan Campbell’s team to put up a fight regardless.\n\nIf you parlay the Eagles’ moneyline and the Lions’ moneyline together, the odds for that scenario are +160. It’s not likely, no, but it’s hardly far-fetched.\n\nThe thinking here is the Eagles will be playing to win in Week 18. The Commanders might not merely lay down after not liking how Philly beat them in Week 16. But their effort might not matter much with Josh Johnson potentially starting at quarterback for them.\n\nI think the Eagles win and cover, perhaps even if Tanner McKee and the backups play most of the game.

    "fullText": "The final Sunday in 2025 provided football fans with a memorable game that featured plenty of offensive firepower.\n\nWith how the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers moved the ball and scored, it felt like a game that would end with whatever team had the ball last.\n\nCaleb Williams and the Bears had their shot with 2:15 left in the game, down by four points.\n\nThe Bears quarterback led his team on a 15-play drive that ended on the 49ers’ 2-yard line after Williams attempted to extend the play to find an open receiver. With the 49ers’ defense closing in, Williams threw a pass into the end zone, but it fell short.\n\nWild ending to an incredible game. pic.twitter.com/Xe6pJkBfEa\n\nThe Bears lost 42-38, which eliminates them from contention for the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Still, as NFC North champions, they will host at least one playoff game at Soldier Field.\n\nHere are the five players who raised and lowered their stock in the Week 17 shootout at Levi’s Stadium.\n\nWilliams had one of his best passing performances of the season, completing 25 of 42 throws for 330 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nHis first TD pass of the day — to rookie Luther Burden III — was a perfectly thrown 35-yard strike in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWilliams’ second TD pass — to Colston Loveland in the second quarter– displayed some of his elite quarterback traits. Williams drew the 49ers’ defense offside with his cadence, kept his eyes downfield after the snap, then threw a dart to his rookie tight end for a 36-yard score.\n\nCaleb Williams gets the 49ers on the hard count.\n\nTouchdown, Colston Loveland\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWith how well the 49ers’ offense played, Williams needed to match Brock Purdy on the other side. For a majority of the game, that’s exactly what he did. However, he missed some throws.\n\nOn the final drive, Williams was heavily pressured on a first-and-10 play. He ran away from the pressure to his right but couldn’t complete a pass to wide-open Devin Duvernay on what might have been a game-winning TD.\n\nthis was 7 pic.twitter.com/WzuR5ONtEM\n\n— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) December 29, 2025\n\nIt only took one play for the former All-Pro cornerback to change the game.\n\nJohnson jumped Jauan Jennings’ slant route and deflected Purdy’s first pass on the first play of the game into the air. T.J. Edwards intercepted the ball and returned it 34 yards for a pick six.\n\nT.J. EDWARDS, PICK-SIX ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nJohnson finished the game with zero receptions allowed on one target. He wasn’t targeted for the remainder of the game after helping cause the pick six, but he also played limited snaps in the second half.\n\nJohnson has given up just seven receptions on 12 targets for 142 yards in six games this season, and he has one interception. It shows just how important keeping Johnson healthy is to the Bears’ defense.\n\nThe Bears’ rookie wide receiver returned to action after missing last week’s win over the Green Bay Packers and quickly made an impact.\n\nEntering their third drive, the Bears had failed to record a first down. Then Williams found Burden for a 10-yard gain on second down. Three plays later, Williams connected with Burden on an explosive 35-yard TD pass, giving Chicago’s offense its first points of the game late in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nBurden finished as the game’s leading receiver with eight receptions on nine targets for 138 yards and the TD. He was injured on the final play of the game, and head coach Ben Johnson didn’t have an immediate update on the rookie’s condition.\n\nThe Bears’ veteran linebacker had the daunting task of trying to contain Christian McCaffrey. The entire defense, especially Edmunds, failed to keep the 49ers’ versatile playmaker in check.\n\nMcCaffrey finished the first half with 18 carries for 121 yards and one TD. He added two receptions for 20 yards as a pass catcher before halftime.\n\n: NBC\nNFL+// https://t.co/Zkva0Y3QRRpic.twitter.com/Lw0glXcnaP\n\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) December 29, 2025\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Edmunds allowed seven receptions on seven targets for 55 yards and two TDs.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense, which features plenty of motions and shifts, forced Edmunds and the rest of the Bears’ defensive front to react slowly, and San Francisco benefited throughout the game, finishing with 496 total yards (200 rushing, 296 passing).\n\nThe Bears cornerback dealt with a hamstring injury and an illness throughout the week, but he was able to start against the 49ers.\n\nHe’s had a remarkable season, but this wasn’t a good showing. Per Pro Football Focus, Wright gave up four receptions on five targets for 73 yards in just the first half.\n\nWright looked a step slow and couldn’t stay in front of opposing receivers.\n\nThe post Five Bears whose stock went up or down in NFL Week 17 loss to 49ers appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",

    "fullText": "One of the best additions the Patriots made this offseason was drafting rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson in the second round of the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHenderson played a crucial role in reshaping New England’s backfield, making second-year quarterback Drake Maye’s journey much smoother and helping him develop into an exceptional player.\n\nHenderson, who has an excellent vantage point to watch Maye each week, spoke about how impressive Maye is as a team player.\n\n“It’s great being able to play alongside Drake,” Henderson said on Sunday. “I always mention he’s such a great leader. I see him each and every day, he works real hard. Even after practice. I feel like it just carries on throughout this whole team.”\n\nMaye had a fantastic performance in the Patriots’ 42-10 victory against the New York Jets on Sunday, throwing for 256 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nHenderson and Maye need to put together a few more standout performances in the coming weeks to help ensure the Patriots win every postseason game they play in.\n\nPatriots’ Stefon Diggs Shares Why He Loves Playing For Mike Vrabel",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have consistently been one of the NFL’s top teams for years, posting a non-losing record in 22 straight seasons and counting. Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns have been historically inept, posting just three winning seasons during the same span.\n\nThe Steelers should dominate the Browns. And yet, that hasn’t been the case at all recently.\n\nCleveland beat Pittsburgh again on Sunday, spoiling the Steelers’ chance to clinch the AFC North with a 13-6 upset. Pittsburgh looked completely helpless on offense for much of the game, failing to score a touchdown and getting shut out during the second half.\n\nIt wasn’t a fluke, either, as the Browns are now 6-1-1 against the Steelers in their last eight meetings in Cleveland. Pittsburgh has lost its last four trips there.\n\nSplit season series 6 out of 7 yr\n\nNo PIT win in CLE without Ben Roethilsberger since Week 12, 2003.\n\n— Andrew Siciliano (@AndrewSiciliano) December 28, 2025\n\nEven worse, the Steelers haven’t won in Cleveland without Ben Roethlisberger since the 2003 season.\n\nDivisional games are often close and tend to produce upsets, but there’s no excuse. Pittsburgh needs to do a better job taking care of business against the Browns, especially this late in the season when Cleveland has a rookie QB under center and nothing to play for.\n\nThe Steelers’ loss this week could come back to haunt them if they lose to the Baltimore Ravens in their season finale, which would cost them the division and a playoff spot. Pittsburgh could have clinched a postseason berth with a win in Cleveland, which should have been relatively easy. Instead, the Steelers laid an egg and now face a win-or-go-home scenario.\n\nIf they lose, they’ll have no one to blame but themselves.\n\nMore Steelers: Myles Garrett Trolls Steelers After Humiliating Loss To Browns\n\nThe post Steelers’ Bizarre Struggles Against Browns Continue With Embarrassing Loss appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "When the Chicago Bears traveled to Motown for their Week 2 matchup against the Detroit Lions, the Lions won big, 52-21. The Lions and their fans were fired up for that game, and it had a playoff-like atmosphere, because they wanted to make a statement and stick it to Ben Johnson for leaving to become the Bears’ head coach.\n\nHindsight tells us that the Week 2 win for Lions’ fans was like their Super Bowl, because earlier this week, their team was eliminated from the playoffs. So they can raise the “Beat Ben Johnson in his first game back” banner and enjoy the offseason!\n\nBut seriously, the (8-8) Lions are still a dangerous team with a high-powered offense, and the (11-5) Bears will need to bounce back after the loss in San Francisco to lock up the two seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Week 18 Lions vs Bears rematch is in Chicago, and our partners at FanDuel Sportsbook have the Bears as a 1.5-point favorite, with the game’s point total over/under at 49.5.\n\nBoth Chicago and the (11-5) Philadelphia Eagles are vying for that second seed, and they’ll both play in the late afternoon window. Philadelphia is a 7.5-point favorite over the visiting Washington Commanders, and if the Bears and Eagles finish with the same record, Chicago holds the tiebreaker.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the early odds for these games?\n\nDo you think the Bears will win and lock up the two seed?",

    "fullText": "Game update (Sunday evening): With Buffalo’s loss to the Eagles, the Patriots have clinched the AFC East.\n\nGame update: New England’s blowout win over the New York Jets moves the Patriots one step closer to clinching the AFC East. If the Bills lose or tie against the Eagles later today, the Patriots will clinch the AFC East title.\n\nIf Buffalo wins that game, New England can clinch the AFC East with a win over the Dolphins next week.\n\nNew England’s win also prevents the Broncos from clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The Patriots can still catch Denver in that race. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nThe New England Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the AFC East in Week 15, when they blew a 21-0 lead and lost to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nBut the upstart Patriots can finish the job in Week 17, albeit with a little bit of help.\n\nHere is how the Patriots can clinch the AFC East for the first time since the 2019 season, Tom Brady’s last campaign in New England.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nHere are the full AFC standings entering Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC East standings entering Week 17:\n\nHere are the current AFC East standings:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x",

    "fullText": "It turns out the New Orleans Saints can win and have their cake and eat it, too. Sunday's win over the Tennessee Titans improved the Saints' record to 6-10 on the year, but it didn't drop the Saints any further down in the 2026 NFL draft order. They're still projected to pick at eighth overall by the experts at Tankathon.\n\nNow, we shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves. There are still a couple of prime-time games left to play and Monday night's matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams could shake things up if the Falcons lose and join the Saints at 6-10. Still, we have a good idea at where many teams will be picking, even if the draft order won't really begin to lock into place until after next week's games.\n\nStill, we're talking about going from eighth to potentially ninth. That would happen if the Falcons lose and their strength of schedule is calculated to be lower than New Orleans'. Right now, the Saints own that tiebreaker at .492 against Atlanta's .498. Margins don't get much slimmer than that.\n\nBut don't expect any help from the Rams. They're still competing for playoff seeding and they happen to own Atlanta's first round draft pick, so they're doubly motivated to beat up on the dirty birds. Of course there's a scenario where the Falcons lose and the Saints remain at No. 8.

Denver Broncos, 13-3 (champions, AFC West)\n\nThe Broncos clinched the division title after holding off the Chiefs on Christmas night and then watching the second-place Chargers lose to the Texans on Saturday. They will need to beat the Chargers or see the Patriots lose to the Dolphins to earn the top seed in Week 18.\n\n2. New England Patriots, 13-3 (champions, AFC East)\n\nThe Patriots clinched the division title with their win over the Jets coupled by the Bills losing the Eagles. They can still earn the top seed over the Broncos with a win over the Dolphins and a Broncos loss to the Chargers in Week 18.\n\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars, 12-4 (first place, AFC South)\n\nThe Jaguars, who have clinched at least an AFC wild-card berth, still lead the division by a game over the Texans after their win over the Colts. The Jaguars will win the division with a win over the Titans or a Texans loss to the Colts in Week 18.\n\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers, 9-7 (first place, AFC North)\n\nThe Steelers, who got shocked by the Browns on Sunday, ssaw their division lead over the Ravens shrink after one game after the Ravens beat the Packers on Saturday night. The Steelers will now host a de facto division championship game vs. the Ravens in Week 18.\n\n5. Houston Texans, 11-5 (second place, AFC South)\n\nThe Texans, who have clinched at least a wild-card berth, kept the pressure on the Jaguars in the division after beating the Chargers on the road on Saturday. The Texans have the top wild-card spot thanks to a head-to-head sweep of the Bills and Chargers. The Texans need the Jaguars to lose to the Titans in Week 18 and also beat the Colts to win a third consecutive division title.\n\n6. Los Angeles Chargers, 11-5 (second place, AFC West)\n\nThe Chargers have clinched a playoff berth and will settle for being a strong wild-card team again. They lose the head-to-head tiebreaker vs. the Texans from Week 17 but hold the common-games tiebreaker over the Bills going into Week 18.\n\n7. Buffalo Bills, 11-5 (second place, AFC East)\n\nThe Bills have clinched a playoff berth but saw their five-year division reign end with their home loss to the Eagles in Week 17 coupled with the Patriots' rout of the Jets. The Bills are playing for only wild-card position now and could rest players vs. the Jets.\n\nNFL WEEK 17 PICKS: Against the spread | Straight-up predictions\n\nThe Ravens kept their division title hopes alive by winning a tough interconference matchup at the Packers on Saturday night and then watching the Steelers lose on Sunday, setting up that winner-take-all rematch in Pittsburgh.\n\nMORE: Giants, Raiders overtake Titans in race for No. 1 pick in draft\n\n8. Indianapolis Colts (8-8)\n10. Miami Dolphins (7-9)\n11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-10)\n12. Kansas City Chiefs (6-10)\n13. Cleveland Browns (4-12)\n14. New York Jets (3-13)\n15. Tennessee Titans (3-13)\n16. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)\n\nThe Colts were eliminated from playoff contention before facing the Jaguars, once the Texans beat the Chargers. The Chiefs continued their freefall, suffering their fifth consecutive defeat—now without Patrick Mahomes—against the Broncos on Christmas night. The Raiders got closer to locking down the top overall drat pick in 2026.\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks, 13-3 (first place, NFC West)\n\nThe Seahawks lead the 49ers and Rams by 1.5 games in the division after their big win over the Panthers in Carolina on Sunday. They will clinch the division title with a losses or ties by both the 49ers on Sunday night and the Rams on Monday night. The Seahawks can take the No. 1 seed with a 49ers tie with the Bears and a Rams loss or tie vs. the Falcons.\n\n2. Chicago Bears, 11-4 (champions, NFC North)\n\nThe Bears clinched the division title on Saturday night before their tough road game against the 49ers on Sunday night, thanks to the Packers losing to the Ravens, which put Green Bay too far behind going into Week 18. The Bears can now focus on beating the 49ers to keep pace with the winning Seahawks in the race for the top seed.\n\n3. Philadelphia Eagles, 11-5 (champions, NFC East)\n\nThe Eagles clinched the division title in Week 16 and stayed in play for the No. 2 seed by winning a tough interconference matchup over the Bills in Buffalo. The Eagles need the Bears to have a lesser record to move up because of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n\n4. Carolina Panthers 8-8 (first place, NFC South)\n\nThe Panthers still lead the Buccaneers by a game after their home loss to the Seahawks because of the Buccaneers' road loss at the Dolphins. The division comes down to the rematch in a de facto NFC South championship game with Carolina going to Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n5. San Francisco 49ers, 11-4 (second place, NFC West)\n\nThe 49ers would be the division champions plus No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs if they beat the visiting current No. 2 Bears on Sunday night and finish a sweep of the visiting Seahawks in Week 18.\n\n6. Los Angeles Rams, 11-4 (third place, NFC West)\n\nThe Rams have clinched at least a wild-card spot but now the division title is out of their control in relation to the Seahawks and 49ers. They're looking at best finishing in second place in the West.\n\n7. Green Bay Packers, 9-6-1 (second place, NFC North)\n\nThe Packers, who clinched a wild-card berth with the Lions losing to the Vikings on Christmas, can no longer win the division title over the Bears after losing at home to the Ravens on Saturday night. They should rest their several injured key players, led by Jordan Love, in Week 18 after locking into this last playoff seed.\n\nMORE: Derrick Henry bulldozes Packers to keep Ravens' playoff hopes alive\n\nThe Buccaneers stayed alive despite their loss Sunday at the Dolphins because the Panthers also lost to the Seahawks, The division title comes down to a one-and-done in Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n8. Minnesota Vikings (8-8)\n9. Detroit Lions (8-8)\n10. Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1)\n12. Atlanta Falcons (6-9)\n13. New Orleans Saints (6-10)\n14. Washington Commanders (4-12)\n15.

Week 17 is here, with teams only having two games left to try to make a bid for postseason contention.\n\nEntering the week, 10 of the 14 total playoff spots up for grabs across the AFC and NFC were clinched. That list grew larger on Christmas, with the Packers landing a spot in the postseason after the Lions were eliminated following their shock defeat to the Vikings. The Houston Texans also beat the Los Angeles Chargers which clinched a playoff berth for the Texans and eliminated the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe top four seeds in each conference go to the division winners, regardless of their record compared to non-division winners. The overall No. 1 seed in both the AFC and NFC will earn a first-round bye in the playoffs and will not play until the Divisional round. That team will also hold home-field advantage until the Super Bowl, assuming it does not lose before then.\n\nDivision winners will also host a wild-card game, which can provide a significant advantage over a road team forced to travel. While it may feel like only one or two major games remain, there is enough variability in the seeding that nearly every game in Week 17 played a role in a team’s clinching scenario.\n\nHere is more on the teams that have clinched a playoff berth inWeek 17.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff standings going into Week 17\n\nHeading into Week 17, 10 of the 14 playoff spots across both conferences had been clinched, and each conference was in the exact same scenario. The Houston Texans were the second team to clinch during Week 17, punching their ticket with a win over the Chargers on Saturday.\n\nThe Packers booked their trip to the playoffs despite a Week 17 defeat at the hands of Baltimore, benefiting from Detroit’s Christmas Day loss to Minnesota.\n\nBoth the Carolina Panthers and the Pittsburgh Steelers had the chance to clinch in Week 17, but both teams lost and will be playing for the division in Week 18.\n\nThere are also other playoff implications in play, with some teams able to clinch their division and lock in a top-four seed.\n\nBelow is a look at the NFL's projected playoff bracket as it stands in Week 17.\n\n1. Denver Broncos (BYE)\n2. New England Patriots vs. 7. Buffalo Bills\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. 6. Los Angeles Chargers\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers vs. 5. Houston Texans\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks (BYE)\n2. Chicago Bears vs. 7. Green Bay Packers\n3. Philadelphia Eagles vs. 6. Los Angeles Rams \n4. Carolina Panthers vs. 5. San Francisco 49ers\n\nHere's how the standings in both conferences break down in Week 17, along with the other teams that are still in the playoff hunt.",

    "fullText": "4 p.m. window update: The Eagles beat the Bills courtesy of a last second stop on a Buffalo two-point conversion attempt. The Bills loss means the Patriots have clinched the AFC East title. They now will play for the No. 1 seed in Week 18.\n\nGame update: The Patriots’ blowout win over the Jets has New England on the cusp of clinching the AFC East title. If the Bills lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles later today, the Patriots will wrap up the division title.\n\nIf the Bills win that game, the Patriots will have to wait until Week 18 to clinch the division. New England would just need a win over the Miami Dolphins to clinch their first division title since 2019.\n\nNew England’s win also denied the Broncos a chance at wrapping up the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nTwo AFC East rivals meet on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\n\nOne team has already clinched a playoff spot, but the other would love to play spoiler.\n\nHere is what is at stake Sunday when the New York Jets host the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Buffalo Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. The Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the division back in Week 15 when they blew a 24-7 halftime lead to the Bills, but still remain in the driver’s seat in the division title race. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nWith the Jets already eliminated from the playoffs, this game has no tiebreaker implications between the two teams.\n\nHowever, it could play a role in the chase for the AFC East title. Right now the Patriots have a one-game lead over the Bills, and with the two teams having split the season series, the second tiebreaker is division record. New England has a 3-1 record in AFC East games (with the Jets and Miami Dolphins remaining) while the Bills are 3-2, with the Jets on the schedule in Week 18. A New England loss to the Jets opens the door to the Patriots and Bills finishing with the same division record, which would then move the AFC East title to the third tiebreaker, which is record in common games. Right now the Patriots are 9-1 in those games while the Bills are 9-2, but a loss to the Jets would drop New England to 9-2.\n\nWhich would potentially mean the AFC East title would be decided by the fourth tiebreaker, AFC record. Entering Week 17 the Bills have a better record in conference games, 8-3 versus 7-3.",

Put these names on your watch list for an easy last-minute add from the waiver wire:\n\nWR Kendrick Bourne, 49ers (especially if Ricky Pearsall's knee and ankle injuries also keep him sidelined)\n\nRead more about George Kittle Week 17 fantasy replacements.\n\nThe Bears wideouts now leave fantasy managers in a predicament if they have no backups; they'll likely have to wait until tonight to get clearer word on their status.\n\nPick up Luther Burden immediately. If he's not available, try for the 49ers' Kendrick Bourne or the Falcons' David Sills V, who are widely available.\n\nEagles at Bills, heavy rain: Bills receivers are risky weekly plays anyway, so Josh Allen and James Cook remain must-starts. Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley should be valued as normal, while A.J. Brown (WR2) and DeVonta Smith (WR2/Flex) remain playable with small dings. TE Dallas Goedert should see plenty of midrange targets in the inclement weather.\n\nSteelers at Browns, periods of rain: Pittsburgh will continue relying on its ground game of Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell, especially with DK Metcalf suspended. Cleveland's offense looks primed to focus on TE Harold Fannin and RB Dylan Sampson, if they're both active, with a side of RB Raheim Sanders.\n\n👀 More updates on major Week 17 fantasy news:\n\nTaysom Hill Week 17 fantasy outlook\n\nGreatest fantasy games: Did Derrick Henry make the list after Week 17?\n\nThis week's fantasy football rankings were updated Sunday at noon ET.\n\nWe've based these fantasy football rankings on full-point PPR scoring except where otherwise noted.\n\nNEW - FANTASY TOOLS: NFL Player Stats | NFL Transactions | NFL Depth Chart",

    "fullText": "The demolition of Hawai’i’s Aloha Stadium is finally underway after several delays.\n\nOnce home to the NFL Pro Bowl, college football’s Hawaiʻi Bowl and University of Hawaiʻi football, Aloha Stadium is transitioning into a new scaled-down stadium with an accompanying entertainment district.\n\nAs part of the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project, the new stadium is set for a projected grand opening in March 2029, and is expected to have a seating capacity of 22,500, less than half of the previous 50,000 seats it held.\n\n“The demolition/dismantling of Aloha Stadium has begun,” Aloha Stadium Authority chairman Eric Fujimoto said at the NASED monthly meeting on Dec. 18. The removal of furnishings and the subsequent dismantling of the facility are expected to take approximately 10 months.\n\nThe beginning of the demolition process marks a major milestone for a plan that has been repeatedly delayed. The reopening of the stadium was initially scheduled to be on time for the Rainbow Warriors’ football season in 2028, but was pushed back to 2029 in August of this year.\n\nBefore its final closing after years of maintenance issues, Aloha Stadium was an innovative steel-constructed venue with movable seating sections for different sports and events.\n\nHowever, the stadium, also known as the Metal Mecca, met its downfall because of that very design structure.\n\nThe steel structure was not a good match for Hawai’i’s humid climate, which led to severe, damaging rust that required frequent repairs.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the stadium with a costly history was put to rest.\n\nWith the demolition now in full swing, attention turns to the broader vision of the NASED project. The construction of the new, smaller stadium and the surrounding entertainment district is expected to cost the state $350 million.\n\nThe new Aloha Stadium’s entertainment district is expected to include 4,000 to 4,500 housing units, multiple hotels, retail and dining spaces and cultural attractions. Residential construction is projected to take place shortly after the opening of the newly renovated Aloha Stadium, as early as 2029 or 2030.\n\nDiego Rivera - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe University of Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors celebrate linebacker Jalen Smith's (3) fumble recovery during an NCAA football game against the Utah State Aggies, Saturday, October 11, 2025.\n\nAfter playing its home games at the Clarence T.C.

They remain behind the Jaguars in the AFC South, but they cannot be eliminated from division contention if the Jaguars win on Sunday. The Chargers have already clinched a playoff berth, but the loss officially eliminates them from AFC West contention. They drop to the No. 7 seed and with Houston holding the tiebreaker over them, it’s unlikely they get much higher in the seeding.\n\nHouston jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter and looked like they might cruise to victory. They never fell behind, but LA fought back and cut the lead to one possession late in the fourth quarter. Special teams miscues once again cost them in the loss. They cut the lead to 20-16 and then missed a field goal. They made a key illegal contact penalty on a third down sack and couldn’t get the ball back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have already clinched a playoff spot.\n\nThe Houston Texans can join them this weekend, starting when the two teams meet Saturday at SoFi Stadium.\n\nHere is where both the Chargers and the Texans stand in the AFC playoff race.\n\nFor the Texans, 2025 has been a tale of two seasons. Houston began the year with three straight losses and went 3-5 over the first half of the season, but a seven-game winning streak has the Texans on the cusp of a playoff berth.\n\nHouston will clinch a playoff spot with a win or a tie in that game against the Chargers.\n\nHowever, even if the Texans lose to the Chargers, they can still clinch a playoff spot on Sunday. Houston is in the playoffs if the Indianapolis Colts lose or tie against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. And speaking of the Jaguars, Houston remains alive in the race for the AFC South title. With wins in their final two games and one loss from the Jaguars down the stretch, the Texans are AFC South champions.\n\nAs for the Chargers, they locked up a playoff spot when the Indianapolis Colts lost to the San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nBut Los Angeles remains alive in the AFC West race. The Denver Broncos moved one step closer to claiming the division title on Christmas night with a win over the Kansas City Chiefs. But with a win over the Texans, the Chargers can wrap up the division title in Week 18, as they take on the Broncos in the final game of the season. A loss or a tie against Houston would eliminate the Chargers from the AFC West race.\n\nHere are the current AFC standings following Denver’s win on Thursday night:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nThis game could have an impact on seeding between the two teams, under the NFL’s tiebreaker formula. As you can see above, right now the Chargers are the No. 5 seed with an 11-4 record, but the Texans are 10-5, down in the No. 7 spot.\n\nIf Houston wins, the two teams would have matching 11-5 records. The Texans’ win would give them a tiebreaker advantage over the Chargers should they finish tied at the end of the season. However, if Houston, Los Angeles, and Buffalo all finish tied at the end of the year, then their respective conference records will be the determining factor. Entering Week 17, the Chargers have an 8-2 record in AFC games, as do the Texans, while Buffalo is 8-3.",

Through 15 weeks, he had 27 tackles 4 sacks and 13 quarterback hits.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $24.2 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: Another year, another Pro Bowl. The left guard has been so honored in all eight seasons, and he has been an All-Pro three times.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $20.2 million, 2027\n\n2025 performance: The 8th-year player signed for 3 years up to $54 million in the offseason.

Denver is guaranteed can clinch home field through the AFC bracket if the Patriots, Jaguars, and Bills all lose on Sunday.\n\nChristmas 8:30 p.m. result: Denver’s win moved the Broncos one step closer to locking up the AFC West, and perhaps the No. 1 seed in the conference. Denver can clinch the AFC West on Saturday if the Chargers lose or tie against the Houston Texans. The Broncos can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference this weekend, but they will need a lot of help to accomplish that goal. Denver locks up the No. 1 seed with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nChristmas 4:30 p.m. result: The Lions lost to the Vikings, which officially clinched a berth for the Packers and eliminated the Lions. That solidifies all but one team in the playoff field. The Packers currently hold the final wild card berth, but still have an outside shot at the NFC North title. The seeding is not set for the six teams already in the field.

    "fullText": "Lamar Jackson injury history: A complete timeline of injuries for Ravens QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere is no doubt Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is one of the most electrifying players in the NFL when healthy, but keeping him 100% healthy has been a challenge at times.\n\nBetween MVP campaigns in 2019 and 2023, Jackson ended two seasons on the sidelines due to injury, and 2025 quickly began to get away from the Ravens when another injury struck.\n\nIt’s likely no coincidence Jackson’s fully healthy seasons have been far and away his best. After recovering from injury in 2022, Jackson returned to MVP form, winning his second MVP award in 2023 before putting together an even more impressive campaign the following season from a statistical standpoint.\n\nHere’s a look back at Jackson’s injury history and how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nMORE:Explaining the Lamar Jackson trade rumors\n\nAfter missing one game for a pre-playoff break in 2019 and another due to COVID-19 in 2020, Jackson missed his first games because of injury in 2021.\n\nWhile a non-COVID illness initially cost him a game against the Chicago Bears in 2021, Jackson went on to miss the Ravens’ final four games of the season with a significant ankle sprain. He suffered the injury early in a loss to the Cleveland Browns in Week 14, and Baltimore limped to an 0-5 finish and missed the playoffs with Jackson out of the mix.\n\nJackson struggled to match his MVP production in 2022, throwing 10 touchdowns over his first three starts but just seven over his final nine before going down with a sprained PCL in his knee.\n\nDespite being labeled week to week and hoping for a playoff return, Jackson missed the final five games of the regular season and the Ravens’ wild-card matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals. Baltimore went 3-3 without Jackson, including a playoff loss, and some wondered whether he had played his last down as a Raven with his contract set to expire after the season.\n\nAfter plenty of speculation about his future, Jackson agreed to a five-year, $260 million contract extension to remain in Baltimore long term.\n\nMORE:Inside Lamar Jackson's family tree\n\nJackson suffered a hamstring injury against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4 of the 2025 season and didn't return for a month, missing games against the Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Bears with a bye week sandwiched in-between.\n\nThe injury cost Jackson a bit longer than he hoped, as the Bears game had been targeted by the Ravens as his potential return date, but he looked every bit like himself in his return against the Miami Dolphins. Unfortunately for Jackson, that momentum did not last.\n\nAfter returning from a hamstring injury, Jackson struggled to play anything like he did in 2024, throwing four touchdowns and five interceptions across seven starts following his return against the Dolphins.\n\nIn the meantime, Jackson battled various ailments that kept him out of practices. Jackson missed practice time with injuries to his ankle, toe and knee, also missing a practice due to illness. While those injuries never kept him out of a game, his performance appeared to be impacted by them.\n\nJackson exited a prime-time game against the New England Patriots with a back contusion and did not return. He was summarily ruled out of the Ravens’ Week 17 game against the Packers. While Jackson did not receive a formal diagnosis beyond a “deep tissue bruise,” the injury was painful enough that he could not return to a pivotal game against an AFC contender.\n\nMORE: Where does Lamar Jackson rank among the 13 greatest Ravens of all time?\n\nBefore his back contusion deep into the 2025 season, Jackson missed 17 games over eight NFL seasons, including the playoffs. Here is the complete breakdown:\n\nJackson's 17 missed games include two due to pre-playoffs rest and two due to illness. His longest injury-related absence spanned six games, as Jackson missed the Ravens' final five regular season games and a playoff game with a sprained PCL in his knee in 2022.",

The Houston Texans beat the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday, which precludes Jacksonville from clinching the division title on Sunday if they beat the Colts. However, a win over Indianapolis would leave Jacksonville in first place holding a one game lead over Houston heading into Week 18.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars clinched a playoff berth this past week, but can clinch something more important in Week 17. They are in control of their fate in the AFC South and clinch the division title as soon as this week. They need a win and some help from their Houston division-mates.\n\nThe Jaguars face the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday and are 5.5-point favorites. Jacksonville will be without right guard Patrick Mekari due to a back injury, while center Robert Hainsey is questionable with a groin injury. The Colts will be without center Tanor Bortolini (concussion) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (back). Their list of questionable players includes cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and right guard Dalton Tucker (shoulder).\n\nIf the Jaguars clinch the AFC South, it would be their first playoff appearance and division title since 2022. That year, they beat the Chargers in the Wild Card round and then lost to the Chiefs in the Divisional Round. They have won their division four times prior to this sesason.\n\nThe Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win and a Texans loss or tie against the Chargers on Saturday.

They could clinch the top seed with some more help on Sunday, but for now they’re guaranteed a top three seed in the 2026 NFL Playoffs.\n\nUpdate (Christmas night): Denver’s win over the Chiefs on Christmas night keeps both of their scenarios alive for Week 17. The Broncos will clinch the AFC West with a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans on Saturday night. Denver can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nThe Denver Broncos travel to GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas night to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnd the Broncos can make it a wonderful Christmas for themselves and their fans with a win over their division rivals, and a little bit of help from around the rest of the league. Denver can clinch both the AFC West, and the No. 1 seed in the AFC, here in Week 17.\n\nThe Denver Broncos last won the AFC West back in 2015.\n\nPeyton Manning — yes, the guy from the commercials — was their starting quarterback.\n\nBut Denver can clinch the AFC West title this week, officially bringing to an end the Kansas City Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nNot only can Denver clinch the AFC West this weekend, but the Broncos also have a narrow path to clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC, something that again the team has not accomplished since that 2015 season.\n\nHowever, Denver would need a lot of help to wrap that up this weekend.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nSo you’re saying there’s a chance …\n\nHere are the full AFC standings heading into Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC West standings entering Week 17\n\nHere are the full AFC West standings with two weeks left in the season:\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x",

    "fullText": "The NFL has fined Chicago Bears defensive end Austin Booker for a couple of illegal hits on Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love in last Saturday night's game, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nBooker was fined $11,636 total for his two hits on Love, including one that knocked Love out of the game with a concussion. It was the more controversial call of the two considering Love lowered his helmet to initiate helmet-to-helmet contact. But Booker was flagged, and now penalized, regardless.\n\nWhen Love exited the game, the Bears defense struggled against backup quarterback Malik Willis, whose mobility proved to be an issue. But Chicago's bend-don't-break defense, coupled with quarterback Caleb Williams' fourth-quarter heroics, was able to pull off an improbable 22-16 overtime win.\n\nMeanwhile, the NFL did not fine Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon for his late hit on wide receiver DJ Moore early in the first quarter. But Moore got the last laugh as he scored the game-winning touchdown in overtime with Nixon draped over him in the end zone.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears DE Austin Booker fined for two hits on Packers QB Jordan Love",

    "fullText": "After finishing their 2024 campaign with a 6-11 record and in fourth place in the NFC West, the San Francisco 49ers knew they needed to make changes, and that's exactly what they did.\n\nSan Francisco, still led by John Lynch and Kyle Shanahan, brought in a new defensive coordinator, made impactful trades and signed free agents that they hoped would contribute.\n\nLess than a year later, the 49ers are already stamped to go to the postseason and could finish as the top team in the conference if they win their final two games of the season.\n\nLooking back at all of the moves they made during the offseason, a few stand out, and Pro Football Focus' Bradley Locker even listed the signing of backup quarterback Mac Jones as one of the 20 best free-agent signings of 2025.\n\n\"As Purdy missed eight games due to a lingering early-season toe ailment, Jones stepped up masterfully in his stead,\" Locker wrote. \"The former Patriot posted a 76.0 PFF passing grade across his eight starts, racking up an 80.1% adjusted completion rate. Indeed, Jones still ranks 16th among quarterbacks in WAR despite not playing since Week 10.\n\nPurdy’s performance of late — highlighted by his 96.6 overall mark in Week 16 — has shut down the idea that Jones could have realistically supplanted him. Still, the former first-round pick acted as a lifeline to lift the 49ers to an 11-4 record.\"\n\nSigning Jones wasn't a no-brainer at the time, as he was coming off a tough end to his time in New England and a mediocre one-year stint in Jacksonville.\n\nHowever, Jones did well in his eight starts, leading San Francisco to a 5-3 record while completing 69.6% of his passes for 2,151 yards, 13 touchdowns and six interceptions.\n\nEven better, the deal Jones signed is for two seasons, so the 49ers could keep him around for 2026 or flip him for a draft pick or another player at a position of need this upcoming offseason.\n\nMore 49ers: 49ers won't have to face top Bears WR in Week 17 matchup\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: NFL analyst says 49ers made one of the 20 best signings last offseason",

Meanwhile, Los Angeles has also averaged 27.8 points across their past five home games.\n\nUltimately, both teams feature capable offenses led by experienced quarterbacks, and with defenses flagged so frequently week after week, it’s hard to see the Texans and Chargers going Under in ideal conditions at SoFi Stadium.\n\nHouston has surrendered the second-fewest yards and lowest EPA per play while allowing the fewest points per game and ranking second in turnover differential. The Texans also pace the NFL in pass rush win rate and rank second in run stop win rate, so there are a lot of feathers in the Houston hat.\n\nWhile the Chargers are definitely legit, I expect the makeshift Los Angeles offensive line to have its hands full on Saturday afternoon.\n\nTurning to the final leg of this same-game parlay, Houston star Nico Collins has cleared this total in six of the past eight games while averaging 5.3 receptions, 8.8 targets, and 90.1 receiving yards per game.\n\nThe Chargers haven’t been gashed through the air with the seventh-lowest yards per attempt allowed, but they have multiple cornerbacks considered day-to-day with injuries, and Collins is a matchup nightmare with a sizable 23.4% target share this season.\n\nNico Collins Over 63.5 receiving yards\n\nBolts quarterback Justin Herbert has topped this total in nine of 15 games this season, and he’s averaged 242.6 passing yards per home game this season.\n\nJustin Herbert Over 217.5 passing yards\n\nNico Collins Over 63.5 receiving yards\n\nSpread: Texans -1.5 (-105) | Chargers +1.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Texans -125 | Chargers +105\n\nOver/Under: Over 39.5 (-110) | Under 39.5 (-110)\n\nHouston has won six of its last 11 road games (+2.50 Units / 19% ROI).

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 1984 Chicago Bears are probably safe.\n\nThat season, they had 72 sacks in 16 games, still the most in NFL history. But at one point this season, the Broncos were on a torrid pace, racking up 46 sacks in their first 10 games and looking like they would shatter that mark.\n\nBut they have cooled off and after sacking Kansas City Chiefs third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun just one time on Christmas night, they will need a small miracle to break that record.\n\nThe Broncos have 64 sacks on the season and need eight to tie the Bears and nine to surpass them. They had one game this season – in Week 13 against the New York Jets– where they sacked Justin Fields nine times. But the Chargers, who the Broncos will face in Week 18, are not the Jets.\n\nIn the first meeting between the Broncos and Chargers this season, back in Week 3, the Broncos sacked Justin Herbert five times. The Chargers do have a depleted offensive line, but nine sacks is probably too much to ask for.\n\nSo what happened? Why did the Broncos' pass rush slow down?\n\nTheir opponents began to place much more focus on stopping the pass rush, realizing that the Broncos had an all-time great unit. Nik Bonitto hasn't had a sack in any of the team's last three games. Jonathon Cooper – who had seven sacks in the first nine games – has a total of one sack in the last seven games.\n\nWith that sack, the Broncos break the franchise's all time single season sack record.\n\nNew record: 64 and counting\n\n— Romi Bean (@Romi_Bean) December 26, 2025\n\nThat is the trend that the entire defense has been on. If Bonitto and Cooper are not going to threaten the quarterback, the team is not going to rack up any sacks. Over the course of the last three games, the Broncos have gotten sacks from the likes of Dondrea Tillman, Jonah Elliss, Malcolm Roach and even Riley Moss, but not their superstar edge rushers.\n\nThe 64 sacks the Broncos have gotten are already the most in franchise history and currently, good for 12th-most in league history.\n\nREAD: Houston Texans can help Broncos achieve their first goal on Saturday\n\nBut it does speak volumes for how good that Bears defense was to get 72, a mark the Broncos likely aren't going to touch, and they'll even have an extra game to do it as the Bears did that in a 16-game season while the league now runs a 17-game season.\n\nBroncos take former player from Chargers ahead of Week 18 showdown between teams\n\nBroncos hand out game ball to ironic player following big Christmas win over Chiefs\n\nBroncos earn first season sweep of Chiefs in over a decade, improve to 13-3 on the season\n\nDenver Broncos should ask Santa for these 4 things for Christmas\n\nBroncos on Christmas: Two of ugliest losses in recent team history came on the holiday",

    "description": "The Waco Connally product has a chance to become one of the first safeties taken in the 2027 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "Amidst departures to the NCAA transfer portal and opt outs for the Citrus Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, the Texas Longhorns received some positive news for the 2026 season on Friday when junior safety Jelani McDonald announced his return for his senior campaign.\n\nAt 6’2 and 199 pounds, McDonald has prototypical size and explosiveness for the position that could allow him to become one of the first safeties taken in the 2027 NFL Draft if he stays healthy and maintains his developmental trajectory.\n\nOut of Waco Connally, McDonald was a late riser in the 2023 recruiting class, receiving his offer from the Longhorns in October when he was committed to Oklahoma State. TCU also factored into McDonald’s recruitment, hosting him for an official and unofficial visit late in the process, but it was McDonald’s time on the Forty Acres in December that ultimately sealed his decision to spurn his father’s alma mater and signed with Texas.\n\nA triple jumper, high jumper, and basketball standout at Connally, McDonald played quarterback, wide receiver, and on defense in high school, allowing him to finish the cycle as a consensus four-star prospect ranked as the No. 74 player nationally and the No. 2 athlete, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.\n\nThe athlete classification certainly fit McDonald, as it wasn’t clear whether he would grow into a linebacker in college even as he displayed the ability to play cornerback despite his height. As a freshman, McDonald m0ved between nickel back, linebacker, cornerback, and safety.\n\nWhile McDonald developed behind the scenes shuffling through positions to determine his future role, he played on three special teams units for the Horns as a true freshman, recording two tackles against Oklahoma State in the Big 12 Championship game.\n\nAs a sophomore, McDonald showed signs of becoming a rising star as he was thrust into playing time due to injuries, totaling 33 tackles, one tackle for loss, one interception, and one pass broken up with four starts over 14 games.\n\nMcDonald took another step forward as a full-time starter in 2025, leading the team in tackles with 73 (43 solo) thanks to late-season injuries sustained by redshirt senior safety Michael Taaffe and junior linebacker Anthony Hill Jr., notching four tackles for loss, three interceptions, three passes broken up, and a fumble return.\n\nWith McDonald returning, Texas has one starter back at the safety position with Taaffe exhausting his eligibility.",

    "fullText": "The Patriots are enjoying a remarkable season, yet despite having one of the top teams in the NFL, they still have a few weaknesses that could come back to haunt them in the playoffs.\n\nBleacher Report’s Brad Gagnon listed New England’s red zone defense as one of its weaknesses.\n\n“The Patriots are clinging to the AFC East lead despite a lack of experience on both sides of the ball,” Gagnon wrote on Friday. “That’s been particularly revealing the last couple of weeks against the Bills and Ravens, where they’ve surrendered seven touchdowns on nine red-zone possessions. Statistically, they have the worst red-zone D in the league this season.”\n\nThe Patriots are giving up a staggering 74% of touchdowns when opponents reach the red zone, making it the worst rate in the NFL.\n\nNew England will likely face a handful of powerful offenses in the postseason, and it won’t be able to compete if it doesn’t limit opposing teams to field goals.\n\nThe Patriots need to focus on improving their red zone defense over the next two weeks, especially as they face the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, both of whom will be starting backup quarterbacks.\n\nWhy NFL Writer Would’ve Loved To See Myles Garrett On Patriots This Season",

He also forced a fumble and had a pass defensed in the win. The All-Pro is tied for the team lead with four interceptions and is the only player in the NFL to have at least four interceptions in each of the past three seasons. With Sunday’s performance, he became the first player in franchise history to have a forced fumble and an interception return for a touchdown in a game.\n\nRB Omarion Hampton had 85 yards rushing and a touchdown on 16 carries against the Cowboys, his most productive showing in three games since returning from a broken ankle. The rookie first-round pick from North Carolina has 516 yards on the ground and four total touchdowns in eight games. The Chargers will need to maintain offensive balance against the outstanding Texans defense.\n\nTexans DE Will Anderson Jr. vs. Chargers' offensive line. Improved pass protection kept QB Justin Herbert from being sacked in Dallas, which in turn allowed the offense to have one of its best performances of the season. However, the difference in quality between the Cowboys’ pass rush and what Anderson and company will bring is stark. Anderson has a career-high 11 1/2 sacks, and his 17 tackles for loss have been just as important in creating obvious passing downs. He has a tackle for loss in 10 of the past 11 games and all seven road games this season.\n\nTexans: RB Woody Marks and LB Azeez Al-Shaair are set to return after missing last week’s game with injuries. … LT Aireontae Ersery is listed as questionable and could miss the game with a thumb injury. … RT Trent Brown (ankle/knee) will not play.\n\nChargers: LT Jamaree Salyer (hamstring), return specialist Derius Davis (ankle), CB Benjamin St-Juste (shoulder) and rookie S R.J. Mickens (shoulder) have all been ruled out. … DL Teair Tart (groin) and RG Mekhi Becton (knee) are questionable. The Chargers estimated Becton would have been a full participant if they had practiced Thursday, which bodes better for his availability.\n\nThe Chargers won the most recent meeting in the regular season, leaving Houston with a 34-24 triumph on Oct. 2, 2022. … The Texans are facing the Chargers at SoFi Stadium for the first time. They came up with a 27-20 victory in September 2019 in their only other trip to Los Angeles since the Chargers left San Diego in 2017.\n\nThe Texans can clinch a playoff berth with a win or tie, or a loss or tie by the Colts. … Houston’s seven-game winning streak is the longest active streak in the NFL and tied for the second longest in franchise history behind a nine-game winning streak in 2018. … DeMeco Ryans is the first head coach in franchise history to win 10 games in three consecutive seasons. … Houston’s defense leads the NFL in yards (272.3) and points (16.6) allowed. … QB C.J. Stroud has had at least 200 yards passing in five straight road games. … RB Nick Chubb had 42 yards of offense last week and had 170 yards of offense and a touchdown in his only career game against the Chargers in 2021 while with Cleveland. … WR Nico Collins had 59 yards receiving last week for his eighth straight game with at least 55 yards receiving. He had seven catches for 122 yards and a touchdown in a playoff win over the Chargers last season. … The Chargers have won 11 games in consecutive seasons for the third time in franchise history (1979-80, 2006-07). … Jim Harbaugh is one of eight NFL head coaches to have multiple 11-win seasons with two different organizations. … The Chargers defense has 13 takeaways (three fumbles, 10 interceptions) in its past six games after getting eight through its first nine games. … Justin Herbert threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns against the Cowboys, his third game this season with multiple touchdowns passes and no interceptions. … WR Ladd McConkey needs two receptions to pass Keenan Allen (148) for most in Chargers history through a player’s first two seasons. … OLB Tuli Tuipulotu got his 13th sack of the season versus the Cowboys. He can become the fifth player in Chargers history with 14 or more in a season (Khalil Mack, Shawne Merriman, Leslie O’Neal, Lee Williams). … S Derwin James Jr. needs one sack to become the third player in NFL history with 600 tackles, 20 sacks and 10 interceptions in his first 100 games (Roquan Smith, Karlos Dansby).\n\nFacing two of the strongest rush defenses in the league, neither Omarion Hampton nor Woody Marks is likely to put up big numbers on the ground. Desperate fantasy owners with limited options will have to gamble that either tailback could make up for it as outlets in the passing game, as Marks was a tremendous receiver in college and Hampton has displayed good hands in his first season.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

Landman, who leads the team with 123 tackles and has forced four fumbles, has been a revelation for the Rams adding range and instincts at a position they have tended not to value. Landman, who played for Atlanta in 2022-24, will be important in trying to corral Falcons RB Bijan Robinson as both a runner and receiver.\n\nRobinson leads the NFL with 131.5 scrimmage yards per game. He needs 151 scrimmage yards to break William Andrews’ team record of 2,176 set in 1983. Robinson has at least 100 combined rushing and receiving yards in 10 games this season.\n\nRams WR Puka Nacua will be a difficult matchup against a short-handed Falcons secondary. Atlanta CB Mike Hughes is expected to miss his second consecutive game with an ankle sprain, leaving undrafted rookie Cobee Bryant and backup C.J. Henderson to work with starter A.J. Terrell. Henderson was signed from the practice squad last week and had a game-saving interception at Arizona. Nacua leads the NFL with 114 catches for 1,592 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nRams:: WR Davante Adams (hamstring) and RG Kevin Dotson (ankle) could be held out as the Rams will prioritize making sure both key players are ready for the playoffs. … S Quentin Lake (elbow) will return to practice next week and could be available for the regular-season finale against the Cardinals. … CB Roger McCreary is expected to play this week after sustaining a groin injury in his Rams’ debut Nov. 23 that led to a stint on injured reserve.\n\nFalcons: Hughes was declared unlikely to return this week by coach Raheem Morris and is expected to miss his second consecutive game. ... WR Drake London (knee) was limited in practice. London returned against Arizona after missing four games. He briefly left the game against the Cardinals after appearing to aggravate the injury but Morris expressed confidence in London's status this week. CB Clark Phillips III (triceps, illness) was designated to return from injured reserve on Wednesday.\n\nThe Rams have won the past two regular-season games against the Falcons, scoring at least 31 points in both games. … The Falcons ended Rams coach Sean McVay’s first season with a 26-13 victory in the NFC wild-card round in January 2018. … Atlanta has won both postseason matchups in this series, which goes back to 1966.\n\nRams QB Matthew Stafford needs two touchdown passes in his last two games to set a single-season career high. He had 41 scoring throws in 2011 with the Detroit Lions and again in 2021 with Los Angeles. … Stafford leads the NFL with 40 TD passes with only five interceptions. ... The Rams have scored 30 points in three straight games for the first time since 2018, when they did it in four straight. … Nacua had a career-high 225 yards receiving in the loss to the Seahawks. It was his third straight game with over 100 yards and sixth of the season. … The previous time the Rams led the league in scoring was in McVay’s first season as head coach in 2017. They have done it six times since the AFL-NFL merger. … TE Colby Parkinson has six touchdown receptions this season and needs one more to set the Rams’ single-season record at the position. … DL Kobie Turner got his first career interception against the Seahawks. Turner needs 2 1/2 sacks in his last two games to set a career high; he had nine sacks as a rookie in 2023. … Morris was the Rams defensive coordinator from 2021-23. ... Atlanta assistant coaches who previously worked on McVay's staff in Los Angeles: offensive coordinator Zac Robinson (2019-23), pass game specialist/game management Tim Berbenich (2023), offensive assistant K.J. Black (2022-23), assistant offensive line coach Nick Jones (2021-23) and director player performance John Griffin (2021-23). ... The Falcons rank second in the league with 50 sacks, five away from their team record of 55 set in 1997. ... Three of the Falcons' six wins came in prime-time games against Minnesota, Buffalo and Tampa Bay. Atlanta lost a prime-time game at San Francisco.\n\nFalcons TE Kyle Pitts has at least six catches in four straight games, including seven for 57 yards and a touchdown last week. His 395 receiving yards in the past four games are the most by a tight end in a four-game span in franchise history. Pitts has set career highs with 80 catches and five touchdown receptions this season and has been especially effective with Kirk Cousins at quarterback.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "A Florida man shot and killed his wife and shot his stepdaughter earlier this week before fatally shooting himself after an argument over an NFL game, authorities said.\n\nJason Kenney, 47, took his own life hours after killing his wife, Crystal Kenney, Dec. 22, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a press conference.\n\nJudd said the murder occurred after Crystal Kenney suggested to her husband that he turn off Monday’s NFL game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFlorida Man Facing Death Penalty For Killing 18-Year-old Girlfriend, Unborn Child After She Refused Abortion\n\nJason Kenney had been drinking, and the argument escalated, prompting his wife to tell her 12-year-old son to call 911.\n\nThe boy ran to a neighbor’s home when he heard gunshots. Responding deputies found Crystal Kenney dead and a 13-year-old girl who had been shot in the shoulder and face.\n\nShe is recovering in a hospital.\n\n\"She said, ‘I begged him, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, and he shot me anyway,’\" Judd said.\n\nArkansas Mom Found Shot To Death With Two Children Wrote Cryptic Facebook Post Months Before Killings\n\nThe boy was unharmed, as was Jason and Crystal’s 1-year-old daughter, who was home at the time of the shooting. She was found by deputies asleep in her crib.\n\nAfter the shooting, Jason Kenney fled and called his sister, who lives in upstate New York, Judd said. He told her he had \"done something\" wrong and that it would be the last time they would talk.\n\nHe then drove to his father’s home, where deputies found him. As deputies attempted to get him out of a shed, Jason fatally shot himself, Judd said.\n\nDuring a search of the family’s home, deputies found a note Crystal wrote to her husband urging him to get help.\n\n\"You’re drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God,\" the note states, Judd said.\n\nThe surviving children are in the custody of grandparents.\n\n\"The entire family was destroyed,\" Judd said. \"Our homicide detectives are distraught. When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under it, just like the nuclear family should be.\"\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — From the moment they hit the gridiron, Mike and Blake Bell were inseparable.\n\nFor two identical twin brothers, a bond could be centered around anything, but for the Bell boys it was always football.\n\nFor nearly their entire lives, they were on the same team. In high school both attended Bishop Carroll, in college they both played for Colorado State, but on draft day things took a turn. Taken second overall by the Chiefs, Mike made Mark a promise.\n\n“The sports information guy said I needed to get over to Kansas City, and I told them, I wasn’t leaving until Mark got drafted,” said Mike Bell.\n\nAfter three rounds, Mark eventually got drafted in the fourth. In a time crunch, Mike would have to leave for Kansas City, but on the way there, he quickly learned that Mark was taken by an AFC West rival.\n\nMaize senior shooting guard leads by example on and off the field\n\n“I’m flying to Kansas City, and as I’m getting off the plane, the pilot comes out and says, I just wanna let you know they radioed up and your brother got drafted to the Seahawks,” said Mike Bell.\n\nThe two faced off twice a year on the opposite side of the ball, with Mike eventually getting the best of Mark in their NFL debut.\n\n“The first play wasn’t that good for me,” Mark said laughingly. “We had some really great memories, though. My mom and dad and the whole family would bring a bus down to Arrowhead to come watch us play, it was really special.”\n\nAnd with all of those great memories, come a legacy that the two brothers will share forever.\n\n“They remember us as the football guys, even though we’ve done different things since then, it’s amazing how that kind of follows you and it just goes with you for your whole life,” said Mike Bell.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

    "description": "The Broncos face the Chiefs in Kansas City on Christmas. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "When the NFL schedule makers sat down to craft the Christmas slate of games, they likely envisioned the clash between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs as a battle for the AFC West title.\n\nWhile the Chiefs have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Broncos can wrap up their first AFC West title since 2015 with a win tonight, and a little bit of help from the Houston Texans on Saturday. In addition, Denver can also secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but they will need a little more help here in Week 17 to clinch the top seed.\n\nLet’s start with the AFC West title. Denver can clinch the division title this week, officially bringing to an end the Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nIn addition, Denver can also wrap up the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week, and the lone bye week in the AFC playoffs.\n\nBut they would need a lot of help to get that done.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWith the Chiefs already eliminated from the playoffs, this game will not have any tiebreaker implications for the Chiefs and Broncos directly.\n\nBut it could play a role for the Broncos when it comes to seeding, in a very narrow scenario.\n\nLooking at the AFC West, the Broncos lead the division with a 12-3 record, while the Chargers are in second place with an 11-4 record. If Denver beats the Chiefs and the Chargers beat the Texans on Saturday, the two teams will meet in Week 18 with the division title up for grabs.\n\nWhy? Because the Chargers against Denver earlier this season, and another win in Week 18 in this scenario, would see the two teams finish at 13-4. The first tiebreaker in a division is head-to-head record, which woudl give the Chargers the AFC West title.\n\nThen the Broncos would be seeded somewhere from No. 5 to No. 7, depending on how the Bills finish, who could also end the year with a 13-4 record. If, again in this scenario, the Bills finish with the same 13-4 record as Denver, the tiebreaker will be conference record. Right now, Buffalo is at 8-3, and they have one AFC game remaining so they would finish at 9-3 in this scenario.\n\nDenver right now has a 7-3 record in AFC games, and would finish at 8-4 in this scenario, dropping them behind the Bills.\n\nAgain, this is a very specific hypothetical, but this game could matter in a tiebreaker scenario.",

Both players succeeded in big ways.\n\nHaulcy led LSU in tackles this past season with 88. He also added three interceptions, four passes broken up, and a forced fumble. He held his own in coverage and was a thumper in the run game. There's nothing else the Tigers could have asked him to do.\n\nThere was a four-week stretch where he finished with at least 12 tackles in each game. It felt like he was involved in every play that went into the box. His best individual game was in the losing effort against the Texas A&M Aggies, when he had 12 tackles with an interception and a pass break up.\n\nThe Texas native is a major college football success story. He came out of high school as a three-star recruit. 247Sports had him ranked as the 150th best safety in that class and the 266th best player in his home state.\n\nHe was viewed with more respect as a transfer, but he still ended up outplaying those expectations. He was the 151st player in the portal and the third-ranked safety. Now, he's going to be one of the first safeties taken in the NFL draft, receiving some second-round evaluations.\n\nHaulcy now becomes the third player from this Tigers team to declare for the draft, joining Delane and Aaron Anderson.",

    "fullText": "Chiefs vs. Broncos live score, updates, highlights from 2025 NFL Christmas game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Broncos\n\nThe NFL on Christmas Day delivers an AFC West rivalry matchup unlike any seen in the last decade, as the Denver Broncos (12-3) travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs (6-9) at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nIn a stunning reversal of roles, the Broncos enter as the dominant force, aiming to secure the AFC West title and remain firmly in the driver's seat for the conference's crucial No. 1 overall seed and the coveted first-round bye. With the Los Angeles Chargers breathing down their necks, a victory over the crippled Chiefs would officially clinch the AFC West for Denver, ending Kansas City's unprecedented nine-year reign as division champions and marking this holiday game as perhaps the most significant in Denver's last ten years.\n\nFor the three-time defending AFC Champion Chiefs, this prime-time holiday slot is a bittersweet stage for an unfamiliar role. Having already been officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era, the Chiefs have seen their season completely unravel, suffering a losing record for the first time since 2012. The franchise is currently battling devastating injuries, with Mahomes and his backup Gardner Minshew both sidelined by ACL injuries, leaving the offense to be managed by third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun. The team that was once the gatekeeper of the AFC has become a hollow shell of its dynasty self.\n\nThe stark contrast in stakes presents a unique challenge to the streaking Broncos, who must overcome a late-season loss to the Jaguars that snapped their 11-game winning streak. Head Coach Sean Payton is stressing focus, emphasizing that despite the Chiefs' struggles, a division title and the No. 1 seed are still their stated goals. A win in Kansas City, where the Broncos have historically struggled, would not only solidify their resurgence but would also serve as the ceremonial passing of the torch, ushering in a new era of dominance in the AFC West.\n\nThis Christmas night contest marks a seismic shift in the AFC power structure. What was once the annual, late-season coronation of the Chiefs is now the potential crowning moment for the Broncos — a team ready to reclaim the top spot in the AFC West and send a clear message to the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Chiefs vs. Broncos on Christmas.

    "description": "The NFL playoff picture is coming into focus. As the season winds through December and January, we’re highlighting each team that has clinched a spot in the 2025-26 NFL playoffs.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Playoffs get started on Saturday, January 10 with four teams kicking off the Wild Card round. The playoff field will feature 14 teams with 12 of them playing that first weekend and the No. 1 seed in each conference getting a bye to the Divisional Round. This year, the opening round features two games on Saturday, three games on Sunday, and one game on Monday.\n\nEight teams will face off in the Divisional round, with that weekend featuring two games on Saturday the 17th and two games on Sunday the 18th. The Conference Championship round follows with the final four teams facing off on Sunday the 25th. The final two teams square off in Santa Clara, California at Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, February 8, 2026.\n\nThe field is slowly filling up as teams punch their ticket for the 2026 NFL Playoffs. Below is each team that has clinched a playoff berth.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (34-26) to improve to 12-2.\n\nThe Broncos have not won a lot of pretty games this season, but they keep on chugging along. Bo Nix has made plays when they’ve mattered most and the Broncos have emerged as arguably the best team in the AFC. They clinched their playoff berth with a comeback win over the Packers and moved a game up on the Patriots for the No. 1 seed. They remain two games up on the Chargers and can clinch the AFC West title and the No. 1 seed with a win and some help in Week 16.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Detroit Lions (41-34) to improve to 11-3\n\nWeek 16 update: The Rams lost to the Seahawks in overtime on Thursday Night Football to drop to second place in the NFC West, pending the outcome of 49ers-Colts on Monday. LA is now 11-4.\n\nThe Rams are playing as well as anybody right now and are headed back to the playoffs. They fell behind by ten points against Detroit, but a big third quarter got them back and they controlled things in the fourth quarter. They are tied with the Seahawks atop the NFC West, but hold the tiebreaker edge for the time-being due to their first head-to-head win over Seattle back in Week 11. The two squads face off in Week 16 with first place in the division and the No. 1 seed in the NFC on the line.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Seahawks (38-37) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Seahawks won a wild overtime thriller over the Rams to clinch a playoff berth. More importantly than securing a playoff berth, the Seahawks moved into first place in the NFC West and took over the No. 1 seed in the conference. They’ve won five straight and close out the season one the road against the Panthers and 49ers. The division title will likely go down to the wire in Week 18.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Washington Commanders (29-18) to improve to 10-5.\n\nThe Eagles have struggled in recent weeks after a 4-0 start, but they are headed back to the playoffs. They rolled over the Commanders in the second half to clinch the NFC East title. It was their second straight win after losing three straight to the Cowboys, Bears, and Chargers. They will head into Week 17 sitting a game back of the Bears for the No. 2 seed and two back of the Seahawks for the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nThe 49ers still have to play on Monday Night Football, but they got good news on Sunday with the Lions loss to the Steelers. San Francisco still has a chance at the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the conference, but they at least know they are officially headed back to the playoffs. They host the Bears in Week 17 and finish the season against at home against the Seahawks.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (22-16) to improve to 11-4, coupled with the Detroit Lions losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nChicago has bigger things in mind, but they at least know they’ll be playing in the postseason. The Bears win the Packers firmed up their lead in the NFC North, and they now have a division-clinching scenario in Week 17. The Bears travel to face the 49ers next week and close out the season at home against the Lions.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Baltimore Ravens (28-24) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Patriots held off Derrick Henry and the Ravens to punch their ticket to the 2026 NFL Playoffs. They remain a game up on the Bills in the AFC East and can clinch the division title next week with a win and a Bills loss. They also moved into a tie with the Broncos for the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Denver has the tiebreaker heading into Week 17 based on the common games tiebreaker.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Denver Broncos (34-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Jaguars are headed back to the playoffs for the first time in three years. They clinched a wild card berth, but will be more focused on the division title. They head into week 17 with an 11-4 record and a one-game lead on the Texans for the division title. They sit in third place in the overall NFC standings and are a game back of the Patriots and Broncos for the top two seeds.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Cleveland Browns (23-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Bills punched their ticket, but the division title is still a possibility. The Patriots lost in Week 16, and the Bills win moved them to only a game back in the division. Buffalo is currently the sixth seed and is riding a four-game win streak as they head toward the playoffs.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Dallas Cowboys (34-17) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Chargers are headed back to the playoffs for a second straight season. They are guaranteed a spot, but still have a shot at the AFC West title. The Broncos loss in Week 16 allowed the Chargers to cut the division lead to one game with two weeks remaining. The Chargers and Broncos face off in Denver in Week 18, so if both teams win in Week 17, that game will be for the division title, and maybe the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Minnesota Vikings (23-10)\n\nThe Packers had two clinching scenarios, one if they won or tied their game against the Ravens on Saturday of Week 17, and one if the Lions lost or tied their game against the Vikings. Detroit ended up losing and Green Bay punched their ticket. The Packers are effectively two games back of the Bears in the NFC North, but they still have a chance at the division title if they can win out and the Bears lose out.",

    "description": "The Lions face the Vikings in Minneapolis on Christmas Day. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "Game result: The Lions are officially done for the season. They have one more game, but they will not be headed to the playoffs. They committed six turnovers, including five by quarterback Jared Goff in a 23-10 loss to the Vikings. The Lions defense kept the team in it, holding the Vikings to only two touchdowns in spite of all the turnovers, but Detroit’s offense could get nothing done.\n\nThe Lions loss also helped the Packers punch their playoff ticket. Green Bay could have clinched their own spot with a win on Saturday over the Ravens, but now they head into that game looking to gain ground on the Bears in the NFC North.\n\nThe Detroit Lions sit on the verge of playoff elimination and need help the final two weeks of the 2025-26 NFL regular season. They can help themselves to start when they face the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas Day. The game kicks off at 4:30 p.m. ET and Detroit is a 5.5-point road favorite.\n\nThis is the second matchup of the season between these two teams. The Vikings won 27-24 in the first game in Detroit. J.J. McCarthy made his return from a high ankle sprain to throw for two touchdowns. The team added 142 rushing yards and held the Lions ground game to just 65 in the win. McCarthy will not play in this game due to a fracture in his throwing hand. Max Brosmer will get the start in his place.\n\nThe Lions had a chance to climb back into the mix last week, but a loss to the Steelers cost them. They have no control over their destiny and could be eliminated regardless of their outcome this week. The Lions are eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to the Vikings or if the Packers win or tie against the Ravens on Saturday. Green Bay is a 2.5-point favorite at home in that game.\n\nEven if the Lions win and the Packers lose, they would still need to win in Week 18 at the Bears and have the Packers lose on the road to the Vikings. It’s possible this could happen, but the odds are not great.\n\nUsing The Athletic playoff simulator, the Lions currently have a 4% chance of making the playoffs. If they beat the Vikings and the Packers lose to the Ravens, their chances increase to 14%.\n\nTiebreakers don’t matter in this situation due to the Packers having a tie on their record. Green Bay has the head-to-head tiebreaker over Detroit, but if the Lions tie the Vikings or Bears to close they season, they are eliminated from playoff contention.",

    "fullText": "On Dec. 22, 2022, Bret Bielema received a Christmas present from Starkville, Mississippi: Ole Miss Quarterback Luke Altmyer transferring to the Illinois Fighting Illini. With three years of eligibility remaining, it would give Bielema and the Illini some much-needed time and the option of stability under center.\n\nThe first year did not go entirely as planned. Altmyer got his feet wet, but his numbers were not that good. He played only nine games due to injury, but he had some good games that gave Illini fans an idea of what to expect, completing 175 passes in 270 attempts (64.8%). He threw for 1,883 yards (209.2 YPG) with 13 TD and 10 INTs (his QB rating was 131.9). He also rushed for 282 yards on 94 carries with three TDs.\n\nIn 2024, his improvement was nothing short of remarkable. Whereas the year prior, he looked rattled at times and unsure of where or when to throw the ball. In ‘24, he seemed more poised, more confident, and better able to read the field. He passed for 2,717 yards, 211 completions in 347 passes with 22 TDs and only six interceptions (a 144.0 QB rating). His rushing yards were down 217 yards on 99 carries with 4 TDs, but that was due to inconsistent line play, allowing 32 sacks.\n\nThis season, he has continued to improve. With a bowl game yet to play, he has already surpassed his yards total from last season, 2,811 yards on 226 of 332 passing. He has attained his highest completion percentage of 68.1% and his highest passer rating of 157.1. He has 21 TDs with only five interceptions.\n\nAltmyer will go down as one of the best quarterbacks in Illinois history. Many people have said he is the best QB at Illinois since Kurt Kittner, with some comparing his leadership to Jeff George. Here are some of the reasons why.\n\nMost TDs in a career tied for 2nd with Juice Williams at 56 (leader is Kurt Kittener with 64).\n\nMost passing yards he is 5th with 7,411(626 yards behind 4th place Juice Williams).\n\nCompletion percentage among starters is 1st at 64.5%.\n\nTD% % with over 500 attempts at 5.9.\n\nYards per play with over 1,000 yards 2nd 7.4 (John Paddock leads with 8.9).\n\nYards per game 3rd at 218 (Tony Eason is 1st with 300.4 and Dave Wilson is 2nd with 286.7)\n\nPasser rating as a starter (minimum 10 starts) at 145.\n\nHow he is looked at nationally:\n\nESPN has him rated as the 12th best in the NCAA this season\n\nProfootballnetwork.com has him listed as #8 in QB power rankings going into the upcoming bowl game.\n\nHe is in the top 25 nationally for completion percentage (68.1%) and passing touchdowns (21).\n\nMost draft analysts have Altmyer as a fifth to seventh-round draft pick. They cite him as being a stable NFL backup QB in a West Coast or RPO offensive scheme.\n\nAmong the attributes they like about him are his performance in clutch situations, his release and touch, his ability to throw high-velocity, accurate passes, his read progression in passing situations, his ability to navigate the pocket, his toughness, his preparedness, and his mental approach to the game.\n\nSome of the cons to his game are his frame, as they cite at 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds, whether he has the durability to withstand an NFL pass rush competition, a hitch in his throwing motion under pressure, the ability to throw in tight coverage, and an athletic ceiling not being a modern dual threat QB.\n\nHe is being compared to NFL backups Cooper Rush and Gardner Minshew in terms of his NFL trajectory. In four mock drafts I have seen so far, he could be taken in the fifth round by Tampa Bay, the sixth round by Minnesota, or the seventh round by either the Bears or Houston.\n\nWith one game to go and an invite to the Senior Bowl, it is a fair bet to say that in the fall of 2026, Luke Altmyer will be on an NFL roster somewhere, probably as a trusted backup. I can see the four teams mentioned in the mock draft models, but I would not rule out teams like Pittsburgh, San Francisco, New England, or Green Bay. Certainly, back-to-back bowl wins would improve his stock, as will a good showing in the Senior Bowl. All in all, the future looks very good for Luke Altmyer.",

He'll still throw the ball, but he may not land as many completions as he would like.\n\nYou can expect at least two of his passes to find the end zone, however.\n\nBo Nix Over 13.5 rushing yards\n\nUnder 238.5 passing yards\n\nUnder 21.5 passing completions\n\nDenver is a monster favorite on Christmas Day, meaning the Broncos won't have to throw much while up big. They'll be able to run the clock down, and as mentioned, the Chiefs will blitz enough times to get Nix out of the pocket where he can scamper past this modest rushing total.\n\nBet on Thursday Night Football at bet365, where your wagers are never ordinary! \n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "Mile High Report’s Christopher Hart gives his picks for Week 17 of the 2025 NFL regular season.",
    "fullText": "Week 17 of the NFL regular season is upon us. Only two more weeks of regular season picks are left. My Week 16 picks were not optimal. I picked just 9 of 16 games correctly. Through fifteen weeks I’m now sitting at 160-80 with predictions. Let’s see if I can do better than I did last week.\n\nChristmas Day (Early Game) —Dallas Cowboys at Washington Commanders\n\nHad events played out differently in the regular season, this game could have been garnered huge playoff implications. Unfortunately, these NFC East rivals are both eliminated from playoff contention. I think the Cowboys end up winning this one on the road.\n\nChristmas Day (Afternoon Game) — Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe only way the Lions can make the playoffs is by winning out and the Packers losing their final two games. It’s a longshot, but stranger things have happened. Not that he has been great, but J.J. McCarthy won’t be playing in this one. That being said, I think Detroit will win this one easily.\n\nChristmas Day (Night Game) — Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Broncos lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars last Sunday. Denver still controls their own destiny and can earn the AFC’s top seed if they beat the Chiefs and Chargers the next two weeks. They’ve got a lot of mistakes to clean up, but I have a feeling they will deliver Broncos Country a present on Christmas night and beat Kansas City.\n\nSaturday Football (Afternoon Game) — Houston Texans at Los Angeles Chargers\n\nBoth the Texans and Chargers are poised to make the postseason. The only question is will it be as a wildcard team or division champion. The stakes are huge for both of them. Houston’s defense has been the strength of their team and Justin Herbert has impressed despite numerous key losses to their offensive line. All things considered, I think DeMeco Ryans has his team ready to win this one.\n\nDeMeco Ryans on the game vs the Chargers:\n\n“No doubt about it. It’s defintley a playoff game. It was a playoff game for us last week. That’s where you want to be in December, playing meaningful games & that’s what this team has earned.” pic.twitter.com/sRbAg9pofV\n\n— Houston Stressans (@TexansCommenter) December 23, 2025\n\nSaturday Football (Evening Game) — Baltimore Ravens at Green Bay Packers\n\nThe Ravens aren’t out of the playoffs yet, but their chances of making the postseason are slim. Currently, the Packers are the NFC’s seventh seed and can punch their playoff ticket with a win. With a back contusion suffered in Week 16, there is a good chance Lamar Jackson doesn’t play. If so, that should make the Packers heavy favorites in this one. I’m taking Green Bay at home.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Arizona Cardinals at Cincinnati Bengals\n\nThis Sunday game is an uninteresting matchup with two teams out of playoff contention. After laying a goose egg a few weeks ago, the Bengals kicked things into high gear last weekend and scored a lot of points. I think they will do the same on Sunday, as the Cardinals are in a tailspin having lost seven games in a row. I’m picking Cincinnati.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Pittsburgh Steelers at Cleveland Browns\n\nThe formula is simple for the Steelers to make the postseason. A win over the Browns guarantees them the AFC North title and the opportunity to host a Wild Card round playoff game. Could the Browns play spoiler? Sure, but don’t count on that. I’m confident that Pittsburgh takes care of business here.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — New Orleans Saints at Tennessee Titans\n\nThe Saints have won three in a row and are now 5-10 on the season. Meanwhile, the Titans are a 3-12 team coming off a victory against the Chiefs in Week 16. There isn’t anything compelling about this matchup to really write about. That being said, I’ll take New Orleans on the road.\n\nTHREE IN A ROW DUBS#Saints | @Gatorade pic.twitter.com/br2Fm49xjA\n\n— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) December 21, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis Colts\n\nThe Jaguars earned a playoff berth defeating the Broncos last weekend. They have a path to the AFC’s top seed, though it will take some help. In order for that to happen, beating the Colts who have dropped five games in a row is a must. Based on what I saw against Denver last Sunday, I like their chances against Indianapolis.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Miami Dolphins\n\nThe Buccaneers started off the season hot but have dropped three games in a row. They have to win this game, and the Panthers need to lose against the Seahawks in order to keep their postseason hopes alive. I’m expecting both of those things to happen, with the Week 18 Buccaneers/Panthers matchup deciding who wins the NFC South.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — New England Patriots at New York Jets\n\nThe Patriots have a path to the top seed in the AFC. In order for that potentiality to become reality, finding a way to beat the Jets on the road needs to take place. I have no concerns about their ability to do so. I don’t think this game will be close at all. I’ve got New England winning on the road in a landslide.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Seattle Seahawks at Carolina Panthers\n\nThe Seahawks defied the odds and rallied late to defeat the Rams in Week 16, whilst the Panthers were able to defeat Tampa Bay. Both these teams want this game. Seattle winning would pretty much assure them the top seed in the NFC. A Panthers win would give them a shot at the NFC South title if the Buccaneers wind up losing. A lot is at stake in this one, but I think Seattle gets a huge road win.\n\nThe Rams would be eliminated from both the #1 seed and NFC West title race if the Seahawks beat the Panthers and the 49ers beat the Bears in Week 17. pic.twitter.com/5H1p6Zi0Ba\n\n— Brian Nemhauser (@hawkblogger) December 23, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — New York Giants at Las Vegas Raiders\n\nSporting 2-13 records, the Giants and Raiders are the worst teams in their respective conferences. The loser of this game will have the upper hand relative to earning the #1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. But maybe something crazy happens and it ends in a tie. Who knows? I don’t really care. I’ll just pick the Giants for the heck of it.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills\n\nBoth the Eagles and Bills have clinched playoff berths. Philadelphia won the NFC East and will get to host a playoff game. The Bills aren’t out of the AFC East race yet but need some help for that to happen. I ultimately expect the Patriots to take that division. Even so, I think the Bills beat the Eagles. It should be a fun matchup either way.\n\nSunday Night Football — Chicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers\n\nBoasting 11-4 records, the Bears and 49ers are also in the postseason. Each team has a slim path to the top seed in the NFC. What both of them have accomplished this year is impressive. I certainly didn’t have either of them securing 11 wins this season. This might be the most fun matchup of Week 17 and should be a great primetime game for all football fans to enjoy. I’m taking the 49ers in this one.\n\nMonday Night Football — Los Angeles Rams at Atlanta Falcons\n\nThe Rams definitely need to find a way to win this game after being stunned by the Seahawks in Week 16. Dropping that game plummeted their chances of being the NFC’s top seed. I’ve got Los Angeles winning this one. And guess what? A victory will make the first-round pick they get from Atlanta better in the ‘26 NFL Draft.",

However, they'll be the opening act for the NFL on Christmas.\n\nThe Cowboys' season was a tale of two sides of the ball. The Dallas offense was one of the more exciting units in the entire league. With Dak Prescott playing at an elite level, throwing the ball to both CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, it was thrilling to watch the Cowboys' offensive attack.\n\nHowever, their defense was one of the worst in the NFL. It got so bad that Jerry Jones brought in some defensive assets to help the struggling unit. While it seemed to improve the defense's overall state, it was not enough to save their season.\n\nAs for the Commanders, it was an unlucky season to say the least. Every week it felt like another key player on their team was injured. Whether it was Jayden Daniels, Terry McLaurin, Austin Ekeler and the list goes on.\n\nWhile neither team has anything to gain, there's always a level of effort for divisional games.\n\nHere's how to listen to Commanders vs. Cowboys on Christmas.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channel 225 (away), 226 (home)\n\nCommanders radio channels: BIG 100 (WBIG-FM 100.3 FM)\n\nCowboys radio channel: 105.3 The Fan (KRLD-FM)\n\nThe Commanders vs. Cowboys game can be listened to on SiriusXM on channels 225 (Cowboys), and 226 (Commanders)\n\nLocally, fans in the Washington area can tune into BIG 100 (WBIG-FM 100.3 FM). In Dallas, fans can listen on 105.3 The Fan (KRLD-FM).\n\nIf you are a new subscriber to SiriusXM, you can get your first month for free. Listen to every NFL game live, plus other sports like college football, MLB, NBA, NHL, NASCAR and more.

    "fullText": "This week, Chiefs Wire's Ed Easton Jr. spoke with retired All-Pro offensive lineman and CBS Sports analyst Kyle Long.\n\nIn his interview with Easton Jr., Long discussed his role as a remote analyst for NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix today.\n\n\"I will be on the desk with Scott Hanson in Los Angeles, and it'll go out to the rest of the world. Obviously, many people will be watching on Netflix. Every single time you see one of those guys run on the field with the orange gloves and say, TV timeout, or the players get a breather, they'll throw it back to the studio,\" said Long, \"Scott and I will be covering all the happenings from that drive, looking ahead, all the storylines you could think of. Obviously, as people watch, they will try to interact. We'll have multiple opportunities to engage in back-and-forth with people around the world. It's a dream come true for me; Christmas and football are always synonymous, just as Thanksgiving is. Nobody does it like Netflix.\"\n\nNFL CHRISTMAS GAMEDAY\nLIVE on Netflix December 25\n-- \nCowboys vs. Commanders @ 1 PM ET\nLions vs. Vikings @ 4:30 PM ET\n\n— Netflix (@netflix) December 4, 2025\n\nLong, a former Kansas City Chiefs player, discussed the Detroit Lions-Minnesota Vikings matchup, which carries postseason implications for Detroit in the NFC North.\n\n\"You've got to keep in mind this Lions team, they went from winless to the bullies to now, you know, middle of the pack, and I think it's almost poetic, because I feel like a Dan Campbell team is not supposed to be at the top of the heap,\" said Long, \"They're supposed to be scratching and clawing their way in. I believe this aligns with the 'MO' (Main Objective) in Detroit. We've got to earn it. We've got to scratch and claw.\"\n\nKansas City notably defeated Detroit earlier this season in Week 6 at Arrowhead Stadium, while the Vikings will play spoiler as hosts of the second game of the doubleheader.\n\n\"The Minnesota Vikings. I mean, I don't know if you're on social media, but there's been a lot of memes about the Minnesota Vikings, particularly their young quarterback, and what I've seen is that the defense has rallied around this guy. \"The protectors on the offensive side rally around this guy,\" said Long. \"You take a look around the NFC North, and the Bears and the Packers are the two teams most likely to make the playoffs. These two teams are fighting for respect, and they know that next year starts now, especially for a guy like J.J. McCarthy. We know how good their coach is. We know about their defense, but the one big question mark is that quarterback. So we're going to find out more about that on Christmas.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kyle Long explains his role on Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

    "fullText": "NFL execs recently weighed in on who they believe should be the NFL's Coach of the Year, and among those mentioned was the Jacksonville Jaguars' Liam Coen.\n\nThe NFL Network's Tom Pelissero polled 30 execs, asking them to vote on who they believe should win each major end-of-season award, such as MVP, Coach of the Year, and others.\n\nWhen it came to Coach of the Year, New England's Mike Vrabel was the clear-cut winner if it were up to the NFL execs. He received 13 votes.\n\nChicago's Ben Johnson was second with six votes, while Coen was third with four votes.\n\nUnder Coen, the Jaguars have made one of the biggest turnarounds in football, going from four wins a season ago to 11 wins with still two games left in the regular season.\n\nJacksonville has clinched a playoff spot, but they also still find themselves in the mix for the AFC's No. 1 seed.\n\nTrevor Lawrence is playing some of the best football of his career over the last month under Coen. The offense has scored 30-plus points in five of their last eight games as well.\n\nNot to be overlooked either is the staff that Coen has assembled around him, which includes offensive coordinator Grant Udinski and defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile, who has turned the Jaguars into a takeaway-heavy defense.\n\nHowever, perhaps what stands out the most about this Coen-led Jaguars team is their resiliency.\n\nAfter blowing a 19-point fourth-quarter lead to Houston, the Jaguars were 5-4, and it felt like a fork in the road moment for this team. But since then, Jacksonville has won six games in a row, which tells us a lot about the makeup of this team under Coen's leadership.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: NFL execs put Jaguars Liam Coen in Coach of the Year conversation",

    "description": "The NFL post-season may be without Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow, but what went wrong for the star quarterbacks, and who is most likely to bounce back?",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs are out of contention for this season's NFL play-offs and so too are their conference rivals Cincinnati.\n\nI just don't see the Baltimore Ravens getting in either. They need to win their last two games to have a chance, so in terms of quarterbacks, that would be a three-headed monster missing from the AFC - Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes.\n\nAll three having injuries this season is just wild, and Jackson went off with another in Sunday's loss to New England. He's already missed three games and in each of the past six weeks has missed at least one day of practice.\n\nI don't think he's ever fully recovered from the main hamstring injured he had. There was one game where it was like \"hey, he's back. He's moving like the Lamar Jackson that we're used to\".\n\nBut if you look at his other injuries - toe, ankle, knee, and now his back - I feel like he's a bit more fragile at the moment, after all the hits he's taken. He's had injuries adding up over the years, so is his style of play sustainable?\n\nI really hope his Super Bowl window hasn't closed because he's so wonderful to watch.\n\nI just think there needs to be a bit of a shake-up at Baltimore because there were some odd moments in Sunday's game, with the play calling and top players making big mistakes in big moments. At the end of the season, someone's got to take responsibility.\n\nThe two main things they've struggled with is Lamar not being healthy and having zero pass rush. I just don't understand it - defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike went down early in the season, so why you wouldn't find an impact player from a pass-rush perspective?\n\nThe Ravens used to have this attitude. Teams used to be scared of that pass rush, that defensive line, and they've kind of lost that.\n\nIt's the same with the Bengals and Chiefs. Although you keep winning, and that means you don't have high draft picks, you've got to be able to build depth in those moments.\n\nIf you're investing on one side of the ball, you've got to draft on the other side. You've got to find ways to strengthen an already elite team - the team that's done it best is the Philadelphia Eagles and their general manager Howie Roseman.",

    "fullText": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (WGN) — While Caleb Williams, DJ Moore and the Chicago Bears’ offense received most of the praise for last weekend’s dramatic, come-from-behind victory over the Green Bay Packers, it would have never happened had it not been for kicker Cairo Santos.\n\nIn a press release on Wednesday, the NFL announced Santos was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for Week 16 after his efforts in the Bears’ 22-16 overtime win versus the Packers.\n\nHow improbable was the Chicago Bears’ OT win over the Green Bay Packers?\n\n“Cairo navigating the wind … It was just unbelievable with the gusty conditions out there. You guys saw all of the paper cups and all of the things flying and floating all over the field,” Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower said. “For him to have the mental fortitude to stay focused and play the conditions is what we talk about doing.\n\n“Not trying to beat the conditions, not being upset about the conditions, but play the conditions. I thought he did an excellent job of that and struck the ball really well … It helped us a ton.”\n\nSantos converted all three of his field goal attempts in a driving wind—from 46, 51 and 43 yards—and his lone point-after attempt. He was also the only NFC kicker to score at least 10 points and make 100% of his kicks, including one from 50 yards or longer.\n\n“It was super gusty. It was a tough day today,” Santos said after the game. “My first 46-yarder was against the wind, and all the other ones were with the wind. IN the fourth quarter, we were kicking with the wind, but it was more of a crosswind. So, we just had to play a perfect ball and trust it.”\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, wind gusts reached as high as 25-30 mph on Saturday at Soldier Field.\n\nOn top of his ten points scored, he also helped Chicago’s special teams unit recover an onside kick with 1:59 remaining in regulation against Green Bay.\n\n“Cairo’s done so much work on campus here, and he’s done it in the offseason too—I’m talking about all different types of kicks,” Hightower said. “I’ve tried to stop him at times from kicking onside kicks so much, like, ‘Hey, it’s time to go in.’ And he keeps doing it. There’s so much work that’s been put in from that standpoint that it’s not an accident.\n\n“He put work in for it and he hit a really good ball.”\n\nHis one make from 50+, a 51-yarder in the fourth quarter, was his 25th made field goal of 50-plus yards as a member of the Bears, the most by any kicker in franchise history.\n\n“I don’t have many words, man. It’s special to do this with you guys—coaches, players,” Santos said after receiving a game ball from Ben Johnson in the postgame locker room.\n\nOver the last two seasons, under Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower, the Bears have earned five Special Teams Player of the Week awards, tied with the Denver Broncos for the most in the NFL.",

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

But the NFL is now following up with the team after hearing from DK Metcalf and others in his appeal hearing. pic.twitter.com/H4nyqbLX1K\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 24, 2025\n\n“The matter remains under review,” an NFL spokesman told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review in an email.\n\nMetcalf's two-game suspension was upheld, the league announced Tuesday evening, ending his regular season.\n\nThe incident occurred in the second quarter of Sunday's game. While the Lions' offense was on the field, Metcalf approached a fan sitting in the front row and wearing a blue wig. After exchanging words with the fan, Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at the fan's head.\n\nWhile the incident was captured on the broadcast, it was not seen by officials.\n\nDK Metcalf appears to have an altercation with a Detroit fan pic.twitter.com/a478Zjg3tR\n\n— NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) December 21, 2025\n\nBecause of that, Metcalf was not penalized and was not ejected from the contest.\n\nThe fan claimed Metcalf threw a punch because the fan taunted the wideout with his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius.\n\nOn Monday, however, sources told Tom Pelissero of NFL Network that the fan used a derogatory term when taunting Metcalf about his mother. That source also claimed the fan called Metcalf \"something we both know you don't call a Black man.\"\n\nThe fan's attorney released a statement Monday calling the allegations against the fan, Ryan Kennedy, \"completely false.\"\n\n\"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the 'N-word,' the 'C-word,' or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game.\n\n\"These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nDuring his Tuesday news conference, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said that although he doesn't condone Metcalf's actions, he supports the wide receiver.\n\n“He did explain to me why he did what he did, and I certainly don’t condone the behavior, but I support DK,\" Tomlin said. \"And I really don’t have a lot to add other than what I just told you.\"\n\nKennedy was escorted from his seat but not ejected from the stadium. The Lions told The Athletic on Tuesday that the team did not plan to take action against Kennedy.\n\nThe Steelers finish the regular season against the Cleveland Browns this Sunday and the Baltimore Ravens in Week 18. Pittsburgh can wrap up the AFC North title this week by beating Cleveland or with a loss by the Ravens to the Green Bay Packers.",

    "description": "Here’s how we think the Denver Broncos will do vs the Kansas City Chiefs during Week 17 action in the NFL.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos will look to turn the page quickly on their tough loss a few days ago with a road win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. The Chiefs are down to their third string quarterback and have nothing left to play for. This is a game the Broncos should win and if they don’t, then the real questions begin.\n\nWe’re pretty confident that this won’t be the case. The Broncos should coast to victory like they did against Kansas City in the final game of last season when they were resting starters instead of being long-eliminated from contention.\n\nDenver Broncos at Kansas City ChiefsP.M. Mile High time\nGEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri\nATS Betting Lines: Denver -13.5\nMoneyline Odds: Denver -1200 / Kansas City +750\nOver/Under: 36.5\nNote: All odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nCollectively, our Mile High Report staff is predicting a Broncos 27-11 win on the road over the Chiefs. Here’s how each of us predicted things would go individually:\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe line in this game is crazy…. if only because the over/under stands at 36.5. They expect the Chiefs offense to sputter and the Broncos offense to be ho-hum. I checked the weather and that isn’t going to be a factor at all it appears. Given all that, I’ll be cheeky here and predict a backdoor cover and an under. Now I just wait for the officiating crew to make it happen! – Tim Lynch\n\nThis one isn’t difficult. The Broncos should beat the Chiefs. It shouldn’t be close. The defense will be looking to make a statement, which should mean bad things for a 3rd string QB. Bo Nix will want some redemption from the loss to Jacksonville. – Adam Malnati\n\nAfter an incredible 11-game winning streak, the Broncos finally suffered their first loss since Week 3 of the regular season. On Christmas, they will play the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Even though the Chiefs will be playing their third-string quarterback, Denver can’t underestimate their division rival. The Broncos have to play a complete game, limit the miscues and mistakes, and find a way to win. Their hopes of an AFC West title and #1 seed depend on it. Ultimately, I believe the Broncos can bounce back to get their thirteenth win of the season. – Chris Hart\n\nNix and the Broncos should win this game. As others have noted, KC is down to their third-string QB and have been eliminated from the AFC Playoffs. But crazy things happen in December at Arrowhead. So Denver can’t look passed this game or just lollygag and expect to get the win. Approach this game like a must-win game, which it is, and put the poor showing against the Jags behind everyone. Take nothing for granted, play a complete game, and make Chiefs Kingdom’s Christmas a little less enjoyable. – Ian St. Clair",

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals need a quarterback this offseason. The question is whether they'll be able to find one in the first round of the NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "How have we gotten here? This Arizona Cardinals’ season was supposed to lead to the playoffs. At the very least, it was supposed to lead to contention. Christmas week should have been about setting the stage for a heavyweight showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nInstead, the Bengals are 5-10 and the Cardinals are somehow even worse, at 3-12.\n\nSo now, that familiar time of year has arrived, far earlier than anyone had hoped. It’s mock draft season.\n\nThis year’s draft class is widely considered to be a thin group, but that’s OK for the Cardinals. They currently hold the No. 6 pick. The big question, though, is where they’ll be able to find their quarterback of the future.\n\nSo for the first time, here are our top 10 projected picks of the 2026 NFL Draft. As always, this mock draft is without trades.\n\nIf the Giants do ultimately end up with the No. 1 pick, a trade becomes highly likely. New York already has a promising young quarterback, Jaxson Dart, while the rest of the top 10 is packed with quarterback-needy teams — including the Cardinals, of course.\n\nWould Arizona pony up the package required for the top selection? That’s a question for general manager Monti Ossenfort and, potentially, head coach Jonathan Gannon, if he retains his job. But it might be the best path to a quarterback, given the teams currently ahead of them.\n\nIf the Giants beat the Raiders this week, though, Las Vegas will jump into the No. 1 spot. Unlike the Giants, the Raiders desperately need quarterback help and would not likely trade the pick.\n\nAs for Reese, he could be the top non-quarterback off the board, as a versatile, explosive player who can line up off the edge or at linebacker. It’s just unlikely it will actually be at the No. 1 pick after trades.\n\nMendoza, this year’s Heisman Trophy winner, is noted for his elite football intelligence and ability to play on-time within an offense. If this Cardinals’ coaching staff remains in place, that will be an appealing proposition, given that they preferred Jacoby Brissett to Kyler Murray for those reasons. The problem will be getting a high enough draft pick to secure Mendoza, who is the betting favorite for the top pick.\n\nSome expect Moore to remain in school, as he has made just 18 career starts and could earn a nice NIL payday if he returned to Oregon. But as his draft stock climbs, so too do his chances of declaring. That would be a major boost for the Cardinals, who need as many quarterbacks as possible in this class to help their chances of finding one. On the field, Moore stands out with his accuracy and creativity as a passer.\n\nAs has been the case for most of the past five decades, the Jets need a quarterback this spring. But if they end up behind the Raiders and Browns, that might require a trade up. Fortunately for New York, they have five first-round picks over the next two years — ammunition that the Cardinals can’t match.\n\nAs for Bain, he’s a powerful edge rusher who just notched three sacks against Texas A&M in the College Football Playoff. He could be the first defensive player off the board.\n\nUnlike the quarterback-needy teams around them, the Titans are in a great spot. Their top offseason priority will be finding talent to help support Cam Ward. And no matter where they end up, they should be able to draft either Tate or Jordyn Tyson, the top two wide receivers.\n\nSo, this is the Cardinals’ conundrum. Only two quarterbacks are currently seen as top-five picks, and one of them might stay in college.\n\nTrading up would be expensive, especially for a team that has holes all over its roster. Ty Simpson — the potential third quarterback off the board — would be a reach. There are few good options, unless their pick moves up over the next two weeks.\n\nAll of that could leave the Cardinals looking to another position. That’s where Fano comes in. He’s an athletic player who is widely considered the top tackle in the class. Pairing him with Paris Johnson Jr. would give the Cardinals their tackle duo of the future and boost an offensive line that has struggled in 2025.\n\nPurely from a talent perspective, Love might be the best player in this class. But as with Ashton Jeanty last year, the issue is positional value. Washington would be passing up on much-needed defensive help to draft Love.\n\nStill, the idea is tantalizing: a hyper-talented running back to pair with Jayden Daniels. That would give Washington one of the league’s most dangerous rushing attacks and reduce the need for Daniels to play hero ball, potentially helping him stay healthier.\n\nTyler Shough has been a pleasant late-season surprise, removing the Saints from the list of teams that need quarterback help. Drafting Tyson to pair with Chris Olave would suddenly create the potential for an exciting offense in New Orleans.\n\nWhile a homecoming with Tyson might be enticing for local fans — especially after missing out on Cam Skattebo last year — the fit doesn’t make much sense for the Cardinals. Wide receiver is one of their few positions of strength.\n\nIn many ways, Downs is the Jeremiyah Love of the defensive side — an elite talent at a non-premium position. The Bengals, though, need all the help they can get on defense, no matter where it comes. Downs would be a nice fit.\n\nSimpson is the wild card of this quarterback class. He could return to college, with only one year of starting experience under his belt. He could also slip to the back of the first round, due to both his lack of his experience and his struggles late in the season. Or teams could be wooed by his processing ability and early-season tape, shooting him up draft boards. All three options are on the table for now.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Early Arizona Cardinals 2026 NFL mock draft",

McCarthy (hand) out this week. pic.twitter.com/Dz1iknCZSL\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 23, 2025\n\nBefore this past Monday’s primetime game, the Colts waived Rypien, who had previously been signed to the active roster a week prior to serve as the QB3 against Seattle, in order to create a spot for activated veteran starting defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, coming off injured reserve.\n\nIt was a little bit surprising that the Colts didn’t elect to carry Rypien and declare him inactive—as a possibility as the emergency QB3 during Monday night’s loss. It’s not that there was a strong chance he would need to be called upon by any means, but a 44-year-old Philip Rivers is presumably at least a little less durable than the average NFL starter, and especially fresh off his couch and with five years of retirement.\n\nNot to mention, rookie Riley Leonard is just a few weeks removed from a knee injury, who has been serving as the Colts’ QB2 since Rivers’ surprising arrival.\n\nAt any rate, Rypien’s stint with the Colts ends without him appearing in an NFL game. The 29-year-old veteran quarterback was signed to the Indianapolis practice squad in mid-October before his signing and release.\n\nHe now reunites with the Vikings, his old squad that he spent last season with and this entire past offseason. However, he has yet to appear in an NFL game Minnesota either. In his 5-year career, he has appeared in 11 games, making 4 starts though.\n\nFor the Colts, Rypien was presumably a candidate to return to their practice squad—should he clear waivers. However, it appears as though he’ll be taking at least a brief pit stop in Minnesota until McCarthy returns.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDuring a key matchup between the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, DK Metcalf gave the NFL an incident to settle.\n\nThe Steelers' star receiver, in his first year with the team as it pursues the AFC North title, was seen swiping at a Lions fan in the stands as he stood on Pittsburgh's sideline at Ford Field.\n\nBecause officials didn't see the interaction, which was caught by the CBS broadcast, Metcalf wasn't disciplined in the game — but he was considered sure to be hearing from the NFL afterward. On Monday, the NFL announced a suspension for Metcalf that is set to heavily impact the Steelers' final playoff push.\n\nHere's what to know about Metcalf's suspension after the Steelers star was seen hitting a Lions fan in Week 16.\n\nWhat to know about DK Metcalf getting physical with a spectator\n\nMeet Ryan Kennedy, the fan that DK Metcalf threw a punch at during Lions-Steelers game\n\nOn Monday, Tom Pelissero reported that the NFL is suspending Metcalf for two games without pay for his physical confrontation with a Lions fan. Metcalf appeal that ruling, but on Tuesday, the two-game suspension was upheld, per Adam Schefter.\n\nThe NFL's statement on the suspension called it \"conduct detrimental to the NFL,\" saying that \"Metcalf's actions violate league policy, which specifies that 'players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day.\"\n\nFrom the NFL on DK Metcalf being suspended two games for his physical confrontation with a fan Sunday. pic.twitter.com/zopnwRAI0A\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) December 22, 2025\n\nSome level of punishment was expected for Metcalf after Sunday's incident.\n\nMetcalf was not disciplined by the officials for his interaction with a Lions fan on the sideline. However, that was because the referees did not see the interaction.\n\nHe appeared to be the one who initiated the physical contact with the fan, which means his situation is unlike that of Lamar Jackson's earlier in 2025, when the Baltimore Ravens quarterback pushed a Bills fan who had slapped his teammate's helmet. In that instance, the NFL did not punish Jackson, as the fan was banned from NFL stadiums and the matter was \"addressed by the club,\" per ESPN.\n\nWhen a player initiates the physical interaction with a fan, it's typically a different story for the league. Metcalf is now set to miss the Steelers' final two regular-season games; he will also be missing out on $277,777 per game check, per Jonathan Jones.\n\nMORE:What to know about the NFL's personal conduct policy\n\nMetcalf will be eligible to return to the Steelers roster on Monday, Jan. 5, after Week 18 is over.\n\nThat means he will miss Pittburgh's final two games of the regular season against the Browns and Ravens.\n\nHere's the moment Metcalf was seen hitting a Lions fan in Sunday's game.\n\nCBS reporter Tracy Wolfson said the fan said something to Metcalf before he swiped at him.\n\nPer ESPN, the Detroit Free Press spoke to the fan in the altercation, and he identified himself as Ryan Kennedy from Pinckney, Michigan. He said he called Metcalf by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.\n\n\"I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,\" Kennedy told the Free Press, per ESPN. \"I'm a little shocked.

Kennedy said that the incident occurred because he called Metcalf by his full name, and the Steelers receiver did not like that.\n\n\"He doesn’t like his government name.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Detroit Lions in Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season, but it wasn't without controversy.\n\nIn the first half, a clip went viral on social media of Pittsburgh wide receiver DK Metcalf appearing to punch a Lions fan in the stands. It was a quick clip, and no context was provided for the interaction at the time, but the video itself looked bad for the pass-catcher.\n\nMetcalf finished out the game because, by the current rule, the NFL can't intervene in a possible player disqualification unless there is a flag. Since the Steelers' offense wasn't even on the field, there were no flags, as the referees weren't even aware it had happened. He was, however, suspended two games by the league, a ruling that was then upheld after an appeal.\n\nWhile the public may never know exactly what happened to cause Metcalf to react that way, he may have a history with the fan.\n\nHere is more on the Lions fan that Metcalf punched in Week 16.\n\nMORE: DK Metcalf throws punch at fan during Lions-Steelers game\n\nThe Lions fan whom Metcalf punched is named Ryan Kennedy.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press was able to track him down after the game for his side of the story.

I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt. I’m a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me.

Kennedy told the Detroit Free Press after the game that he called the wide receiver by his legal name, causing the outburst.\n\nSources told NFL Network's Tom Pelissero that Kennedy and Metcalf have history. Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy last year when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and he reported the fan to stadium security.\n\nChad Ochocino said on a live stream appearance with Shannon Sharpe that sources told him that the fan called Metcalf a racial slur, and then made derogatory comments about the player's mother, but none of these claims have been confirmed.\n\nMetcalf's real name is DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, but he prefers to go by DK.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture in Week 16\n\nAfter the claims from Ochocinco that Kennedy used racial or derogatory language against Metcalf, the Lions fan, via his lawyer, released a statement denying that report.\n\nThe statement reads, \"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game.

    "description": "Cleveland Browns QB Shedeur Sanders has shown development but the 2026 NFL draft could bring Dante Moore, Fernando Mendoza",
    "fullText": "In sports, in general, in 2025, there is no room for nuance. We know there is here at DBN in our comment section and in The Feed, but the general sports world speaks in certainties that really don’t exist and cliché sayings (both old and new) that lack detail.\n\nDuring the Cleveland Browns’ Week 16 game against the Buffalo Bills, I was reminded of a few of those certainties and clichés. For example, many have buried QB Shedeur Sanders as having no chance of being a top-level starter in the NFL, while others have looked at the exact same performances and seen enough to know for sure the Browns should build around their fifth-round quarterback.\n\nThe cliche “if it hits your hands, you should catch it” came up after Sanders’ first interception. In my analysis, Sanders’ throw was behind and thrown too hard for RB Quinshon Judkins to be able to haul it in easily. A great receiver may have been able to make the catch, but assuming Cleveland’s running back should have caught it was too far for what I saw. For others:\n\nEh make a play.\n\nThat definitely wasn’t too hard. Definitely was too behind…but also catch the ball.\n\n— Michael Keefe (@GarageBeersMike) December 21, 2025\n\nFor what it is worth, Michael Keefe is a friend of mine who understands football and has an amazing sports voice (literal voice); we just disagree here. I’ll forever argue in the nuance, especially when most others are only arguing on the extremes and in clichés.\n\nWhich brings us back to Sanders’ future:\n\n“Shedeur deserves more time to develop with a better OL and better weapons”.’\n\nAnd \n\n“You can’t pass on Mendoza or Moore in the Top 3 if one is there”\n\nCan both be true, IMO #DawgPound\n\n— CLEology (@_CLEology) December 22, 2025\n\nYes, Clay (another sports friend of mine), both can be true.\n\nJason Lloyd of The Athletic pointed out what the raw data has told us about both Dillon Gabriel and Sanders:\n\nGabriel has a higher Expected Points Added per dropback than Sanders — although that isn’t really saying much since Gabriel and Sanders have the two lowest figures in the league this season. Sanders has thrown for more yards and is averaging more yards per attempt, but Gabriel has a higher completion percentage, a higher passer rating and a higher touchdown-to-interception ratio.\n\nThe big difference, as you turn to the film that has led to that data, is that Sanders’ play looks like a rookie quarterback who is making big mistakes, but is also growing and developing. Whether it is the deep throws to Isaiah Bond, the feathered throws to Harold Fannin Jr., the successful scrambles at key moments, or his improved (still shaky) pocket presence, Sanders has shown that he could develop into a starter in the NFL…\n\n… but the Browns are going to have a top pick in the 2026 NFL draft to select a quarterback, Dante Moore or Fernando Mendoza, that they’ll likely have a much higher prospect grade on.\n\nIf Cleveland doesn’t have a high grade on Moore, Mendoza, or another quarterback, they would look to build around Sanders, even if they trade down to hedge their bets for a QB in the 2027 NFL draft. If the Browns didn’t have a pick where they could select one of the top quarterbacks (something Sanders could still impact in the last two weeks of the season), the team would continue to develop Sanders with an improved group of players around him and veteran QB Deshaun Watson supporting him as his backup.\n\nBarring a win or two, Cleveland will be selecting at the top of the upcoming draft and, most likely, picking a quarterback.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Sanders doesn’t have a role with the Browns. As is true with all rookie quarterbacks, I’m always in the “sit them until they are ready, plus a game or two” camp of development. Sanders could have all of training camp and the start of the 2026 NFL season to prove he is a capable starter in the NFL. Auditioning for Cleveland and every other team in the NFL while Moore, Mendoza, or whoever sits and waits.\n\nEven if Sanders is the backup, the young QB will have all of camp and preseason to audition for a starting job on other teams. This season has shown (with undrafted rookies starting in multiple places) the dire need for quality quarterback play around the league. If Sanders is able to show his development, even if designated as a backup, he’ll have a chance to start for another team in the very near future, and the team would get a quality return if their fifth-round pick proves he is a starting-caliber QB.\n\nThe Browns have gone decades with just one starting-level quarterback (Baker Mayfield) on their roster. In 2026, there could be two in Cleveland if the Browns select a quarterback high in this year’s draft and Sanders continues to develop. If that happens, whoever is in charge of the front office will have a difficult decision to make. A great problem to have.\n\nShedeur Sanders has shown signs that he could develop into a starting-level quarterback, and the Cleveland Browns are likely to draft a quarterback high in the 2026 NFL draft. Both are true, and Sanders’ role with the Browns will continue in 2026.",

Since then, the family has helped him manage the condition.\n\n“What we’ve learned through our experience is that these kids are warriors,” Philip Rivers told PEOPLE. “We have seen firsthand the tremendous responsibility it is for these children to have the discipline to manage the disease with the support of family, and their health providers to live their best lives.”\n\nPhilip and Tiffany sold custom products through Tiffany's swimwear brand, Hermoza, to raise money for diabetes foundations in 2019.\n\nLike his father, Gunner became the starting quarterback at his high school, St. Michael Catholic in Alabama, as a freshman. Philip has coached the team led by his son, saying in 2023 that he doesn't have a desire to coach any higher than high school.\n\n“I think I would have gone right into it had that been what I wanted to do,” Philip Rivers told AL.com. “But, really, I’ve longed to coach my boys and these other 15-18 year-old boys since I was 25. I’m good right here.”\n\nPer AL.com, with Gunner as his starting quarterback, Philip Rivers led St. Michael Catholic to the playoffs in 2023 for the first time in school history. As of 2025, Gunner was a junior and beginning to eye college recruiting, with Philip Rivers telling AL.com that the family was keeping up with college football more because of it.\n\n247Sports has rated Gunner as a four-star quarterback prospect in the class of 2027, listing offers from Auburn, Miami, Boston College and more. And naturally, 247Sports scouting director Andrew Ivins compared Gunner's play style to his father's.\n\n\"Modern pocket passer with elite pedigree that wins with touch, timing and sound decision-making. Owns more of a unique shot put-like release, but makes it work, much like dad did many moons ago,\" Ivins wrote of Gunner Rivers. \"Projects at this stage as a high-end distributor with a rare set of intangibles that has a chance to be a difference-maker at the game’s highest level.\"\n\nAs for Peter Rivers, born in 2011, his father described him as an \"old soul\" to the Indianapolis Star in 2020. Peter also loves sports, his father said.\n\n“He kind of reminds me of a little slot receiver,” Philip Rivers said of Peter, per IndyStar. “Kind of like a Wes Welker.”\n\nThe youngest son is Andrew, who was born in October 2023. He was the Rivers' 10th child.\n\n“It’s awesome. Tiffany is awesome,” Philip Rivers told AL.com when Andrew was born. “It doesn’t matter if it’s the first child or the 10th child. It’s an awesome miracle every time. Everyone is home now, and everyone is good.”\n\nPhilip and Tiffany Rivers have seven daughters. The oldest is Halle, who was born in July 2002 — around two years before Philip reached the NFL, while he still was playing football at NC State. Tiffany also went to NC State.\n\nPer People, Halle previously said that she's used to the public interest that comes with having a quarterback father.\n\n\"He's been famous since before I was born,\" Halle said, per People. \"It's just been normal kind of my whole life. ... He's an NFL quarterback; he's doing a million different things every day, but every day he comes home, and he wants to be with us. If he has one extra minute that he could do something else, he'll be with us.\"\n\nIn 2020, Philip Rivers told the Indianapolis Star that Halle reminds him of his wife.\n\n“She reminds me, big-time, of her mom, which is a big compliment,” Rivers said, per the Indianapolis Star. “The biggest compliment I can probably give.”\n\nAs of 2025, Halle Rivers has a child of her own, making Philip and Tiffany grandparents. Philip announced in May 2025 that he had a new grandson.\n\nCaroline Rivers was the couple's second child, born in 2005, when Philip was beginning his Chargers career.\n\n“Caroline is very strong-willed, and I say that as a huge compliment,” Rivers said of Caroline in 2020. “She’s kind of a go-getter in that regard.”\n\nGrace Rivers, born in 2006, was nicknamed \"Combo\" by her parents at a young age, per the Indianapolis Star, for being like a blend of her mother and her father. She played both tennis and basketball.\n\n“She goes with the flow,” Philip Rivers said of Grace.\n\nBorn in 2010, Sarah Rivers was the couple's fourth daughter. Philip said in 2020 that Grace had gotten into swimming as she tried to find a sport she enjoyed.\n\n“Sarah’s got a big personality, loves to talk,” Philip Rivers said. “She is chatty, and I say that in a good way.”\n\nIn 2013, Philip and Tiffany welcomed their seventh child, Rebecca Rivers, and in 2015, Clare Rivers was their eighth child. Philip called Rebecca \"strong-willed\" to the Indianapolis Star in 2020; he also shared that Clare was born exactly two years after Rebecca, so they share a birthday.\n\n“They use the term they’re 'birthday sisters',” Philip Rivers said. “They enjoy having the same birthday right now. I don’t know if it will be the same when they’re 12 or 14.”\n\nAnna Rivers is the couple's youngest daughter. She was born in March 2019, with the Chargers' social media accounts announcing her birth.\n\nSHE'S HERE.\n\nWelcome to the world, Anna Rivers 👶 https://t.co/oafdNNI6lI\n\n— Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) March 26, 2019\n\nBefore Anna was born, Tiffany told WWD that the arrival of their seventh daughter would be a generational experience for the Rivers family.\n\n“This is the third generation in Philip’s family, who has seven girls and two boys so we were pretty excited about that,\" she said. \"When we told his 91-year-old grandfather, he said, ‘You didn’t have to go to the doctor to find that out. I could have told you — that’s family history.’ ”\n\nPhilip Rivers has one known grandson, as his oldest daughter, Halle, welcomed a son. In a video shared by Jon Gruden in May 2025, Philip shared that he had become a grandfather.\n\nMORE:Meet Justin Herbert's full family\n\nPhilip Rivers' wife is Tiffany Rivers. The two met in middle school in Alabama, then began dating in high school before attending North Carolina State University together then getting married in 2001 during their freshman year of college. Since then, Philip and Tiffany have welcomed 10 children.\n\nPhilip told The Chastity Project that he remembered first seeing Tiffany when he was young.\n\n“With Tiffany, I remember pointing her out at a ballgame at the ball field when I was young,” he said. “But I remember telling my mom, ‘Hey Mom, see that girl over there, she’s a good girl.’ And she was centered on faith and Christ. She had those values that I was looking for.”\n\nPhilip also said that while he grew up in the Catholic Church, his wife converted and became a Catholic the day before their wedding.\n\n“My wife had a lot to do with it, she’s a convert and she actually became Catholic the day before we got married,\" Philip told Life Teen, per The Christian Post. \"There’s so many gifts from the Faith to appreciate and it strikes people differently, but the one-ness of the Church wherever you are, Raleigh, San Diego, Alabama. Every place we were was home because the Catholic Church is the same everywhere.\"\n\nPhilip and Tiffany welcomed their first daughter, Halle, while they were in school at NC State in 2002. Philip was the starting quarterback for the Wolfpack, while Tiffany \"had a job working with children,\" per People.\n\nIn 2019, Philip spoke about how \"steady\" Tiffany has been as a mother and wife for their family.\n\n\"\"Our family wouldn't be what it is without her. She provides a great steadiness for all of us,\" he said. \"She's great for me also from a football standpoint as far as balancing my energy and passion I have for football. And she's the same with our family.\"\n\nThrough all the ups and downs that comes with football, and all the commitments that I obviously have, I can't imagine doing this without her. There's no way I could do it without her.\"\n\nTiffany co-founded a swimwear line called Hermoza alongside Marisa De Lecce. She also worked with Philip in 2009 to create the Rivers of Hope Foundation, which helped orphaned and foster children find homes. The nonprofit raised over $1 million until its closure in 2013.\n\n\"Tiffany and I are honored to be involved in bringing hope and awareness to the plight of foster children in San Diego County. But now we want to broaden our focus and take a behind-the-scenes approach to helping children,\" Philip said in a statement at the time, per CBS 8. \"Tiffany and I have seen great things happen in the last four years with the public foundation, and now we want to expand our personal efforts for these purposes. It takes us out of the public eye and puts the kids center-stage.”\n\nMORE: Anthony Richardson's full family tree\n\nIn December 2025, when Rivers was playing his second game since un-retiring for the Colts, his entire family was in attendance to watch him take on the San Francisco 49ers.

We need Philip upright. Other than that, I'm real nervous during the game because I want him to win so bad, and I am competitive. I'm just so pleased with everything that has happened in his life. He's just been such a good role model for his brother and sister, and for even us. He's such a good leader. He leads our family, in a way.
