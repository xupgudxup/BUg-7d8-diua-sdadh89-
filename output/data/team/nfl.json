This matchup looked like it would be a clash between the best from the AFC and NFC, but there was a dramatic shift in the outlook for this game in Week 14.\n\nColts starting quarterback Daniel Jones looked like the favorite to win the league's Comeback Player of the Year with how well he had played for Indianapolis. Unfortunately, Jones, who had been dealing with a fracture in his left leg, tore his right Achilles tendon and is done for the season.\n\nAdding to the injury report, backup quarterback Riley Leonard also started the week on the injury report, leaving a huge question mark under center.\n\nSeattle has won three games in a row. Over the last two weeks, the Seahawks outscored their opponents 63-9 in a dominant stretch. Eyes will be on wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who continues to chase the all-time single-season receiving record.\n\nHere is more on how to watch the Seahawks take on the Colts in Week 15.\n\nNFL fans can watch the Seahawks take on the Colts on CBS.\n\nCBS will utilize a three-man booth for this game.

    "description": "The Los Angeles Rams could upgrade their offense in the 2026 draft.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams don't have time to think about the 2026 NFL Draft just yet, but they will be in a few months. L.A. currently has two first-round picks thanks to the team's 2025 trade with the Atlanta Falcons, and could be picking in the top-10 depending on how the rest of the season pans out.\n\nIn FOX Sports draft expert Rob Rang's latest mock draft, the Rams go all offense with their first two picks. Rang predicts L.A. takes Utah offensive tackle Spencer Fano with the Falcons' pick and then comes back around with an offensive weapon at the end of the first round with Washington receiver Denzel Boston.\n\nOne of the few areas of concern for the Rams is at right tackle, where Warren McClendon has struggled with inconsistency. The 6-foot-6, 309 pound Fano is surprisingly agile with NFL bloodlines and experience playing both tackle spots.\n\nThere are a lot of gifted receiver tandems in the NFL, but few can match the Rams’ Puka Nacua and Davante Adams’ production. Both, however, have struggled with durability, which could leave Les Snead valuing Boston's similar combination of size and ball skills. With an extra first-round pick to play with, Snead might view adding yet another gifted pass-catcher for Matthew Stafford to target as a cheap and savvy insurance policy.\n\nThe picks make sense on its surface, but both would be luxury selections for the Rams.\n\nMcClendon has been playing like one of the better linemen recently in place of the injured Rob Havenstein. If he finishes strong, the Rams may not need to look at linemen early in the 2026 draft.\n\nMeanwhile, Boston doesn't fill an obvious need for L.A. Nacua will be around for a while and Adams sounds like he'll stick around as long as Stafford is on the team. The Rams have a solid depth of players behind both Jordan Whittington and Konata Mumpfield, so adding Boston now wouldn't give any of the backup receivers a chance to develop.\n\nBoston has been great for Washington over the past two years, though. The 6-foot-4, 209-pounder caught 119 receptions for 1,589 yards and 19 touchdowns over his past 24 games. Drafting him would be a future-looking move for a Rams team looking to maximize it's Super Bowl contention window.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: 2026 NFL mock draft: Rams upgrade offense in first round",

    "description": "With Stafford close to overtaking Rivers on the list (and Rivers not far behind another legendary quarterback), we could see some movement this year.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers is back. Well, sort of back.\n\nAfter working out with the Colts earlier this week following a season-ending injury to starter Daniel Jones and an undisclosed injury to backup Riley Leonard, Rivers officially ended his retirement to sign with the Colts' practice squad. But initially, it seemed Rivers was a contingency plan for the Colts, and that they were hopeful Leonard would be healthy enough to start.\n\nNow, Leonard apparently \"feels great\" and has participated in three consecutive practices as of Friday. But Colts head coach Shane Steichen, who worked with Rivers for six seasons with the Chargers, would not confirm whether or not he planned to start Rivers this weekend, increasing the likelihood that we may see the 44-year-old veteran lace up his cleats for the first time in nearly five years after retiring following the 2020 season.\n\n\"He's got great command in the huddle. He was throwing it well. So we're excited for it. He's fired up for the challenge, getting back into it, getting back in the fold, feeling the pass rush. Got some good work in that,\" Steichen said.\n\n\"I'll say it was pretty good. A guy that hasn't been out there in five years, to go and practice the way he did this week was pretty impressive to watch.\"\n\nThose sound like the words of a coach who is impressed with his quarterback, so maybe it's not so crazy to think we'll see Rivers this week. And if we do, it will be just in time to defend his spot on the NFL all-time passing yards list. You see, Rivers currently ranks seventh in career passing yards, with 63,440 yards. But behind him at number eight on the list is another active quarterback – Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, with 63,163 yards.\n\nFor those whose strong suit isn't math, Stafford trails Rivers by just 277 yards. Stafford has thrown for that amount or more six times this season, including in last week's win over Arizona, where he tallied 281 passing yards. So really, Stafford is one good game away from the record. But this all changes if Rivers gets playing time this weekend.\n\nIf Rivers is back in action, then this becomes a race. And what if Rivers does play, performs well, and is back next year? You see, Stafford is getting older as well, and is currently 37 and playing his 17th NFL season. Yes, he looks to be at the top of his game, but the body won't hold out forever unless you're Philip Rivers, apparently. So who is to say Stafford doesn't end up trapped at eighth?\n\nAnd for another fun fact, Rivers needs just 649 yards to surpass Ben Roethlisberger for sixth all-time on the list. So if Rivers does get rolling or comes back for another year, he might knock Big Ben down a rung on the ladder as well. And above Roethlisberger? Well, that's current Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who passed the former Steelers signal caller at the beginning of this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Can Philip Rivers fend off Matt Stafford on NFL career passing list?",

    "fullText": "Cardinals predicted to replace Kyler Murray, make bold trade in 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNot much has gone right for the Arizona Cardinals in 2025.\n\nThere was some optimism around the team this offseason, but the season has been a complete failure. Entering Week 15, the team is sitting at 3-10 and is buried at the bottom of the NFC West.\n\nQuarterback Kyler Murray has only played in five games this season, and it was recently revealed that he will not return in 2025. Is it possible we've seen the last of Murray in a Cardinals' uniform?\n\nPatrick K. Flowers of Bleacher Nation thinks so. Flowers published an updated mock draft, and he has the Cardinals making a bold move to replace Murray in the first round of the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nFlowers has the Cardinals trading up with the New York Giants for the No. 1 pick and selecting Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.\n\nRegarding the Mendoza selection, Flowers offered the following:\n\nThe Cardinals are going to move on from Kyler Murray. If they don’t trade up with the Giants (who seem intrigued enough in Jaxson Dart to pass on a QB), they’ll almost absolutely be shut out on the big three in the class.\n\nAs Flowers mentioned, it seems likely the Cardinals will move on from Murray. ESPN's Josh Weinfuss recently broke down that possibility, and explained that the Cardinals could save up to $42.5 million if they trade Murray after June 1.\n\nIt's not like the Cardinals were having much success with Murray, anyways. The quarterback went 2-3 as the starter this year and has not been to the playoffs since 2021.\n\nIn Mendoza, the Cardinals would be getting arguably the top quarterback prospect in the 2026 class. Mendoza is the heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy and he led the Hoosiers to a perfect record, Big 10 Championship, and a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\nIn 2025, his first season in Indiana, Mendoza has thrown for 2,980 yards with 33 touchdowns and six interceptions. Mendoza led the FBS in touchdown passes and led the Big 10 in yards per attempt.\n\nMendoza has an NFL arm and solid enough mobility to make some plays with his legs. He moves through his progressions nicely and is able to make throws in tight windows.\n\nIf the Cardinals move on from Murray, Mendoza could start immediately. Jacoby Brissett, who has looked serviceable in relief of Murray this season, is under contract for 2026, so he could be a perfect mentor to Mendoza.",

    "fullText": "Jeremiyah Love mock draft projection: Where will Notre Dame RB get picked in 2026 NFL Draft? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJeremiyah Love has put together two similar monster years as Notre Dame's top running back. His 2025 campaign earned him a trip to New York as a Heisman Trophy finalist.\n\nAfter amassing 2,497 rushing yards and scoring 35 touchdowns the past two seasons, averaging 6.9 yards per carry, Love has emerged as the clear best running back prospect for the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nHere's breaking down Love's talented skill set and how high he can go as a first-round pick when he's selected on April 23:\n\nMORE: The case for and against Jeremiyah Love for the Heisman\n\nLove (6-0, 214) is a well-built power back who also has great explosiveness to reel off long runs. His experience and consistency should make the St. Louis native have a smooth transition to the NFL\n\nLove is a complete back. He's got the power to run well through initial tackles and get tough chunks between the tackles. He's also got the breakaway speed to bounce any run to the outside or open field and go the distance with any touch. He is smart and reads his blocks well, showing exceptional balance, vision and patience. Although he wasn't used a lot as a receiver, he has the good hands to be a difference-maker in the passing game, extending from his rushing assets.\n\nLove might need to get a little stronger to hold up as the same type of power back in the NFL. Like most rookies coming into the NFL, pass blocking will become a greater emphasis to ensure he can stay on the field for three downs.\n\nMORE: College football bowl picks, predictions for CFP games\n\nAlvin Kamara is nearing the end at 31. The Saints have a lot of needs as a rebuilding team, but if they don't go defense or offensive line, Love would be a strong pick for offensive-minded Kellen Moore, who produced a career year out of Saquon Barkley in the Eagles' Super Bowl-winning run last season. Love's home-run attributes would add a needed fresh legs element.\n\nBetween Brian Robinson Jr., Austin Ekeler getting hurt and the team mashing up a committee of Chris Rodriguez Jr., Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Jeremy McNichols, the Commanders need to clean up their backfield and give Jayden Daniels a worthy, healthy young running mate. Adding Love would be much like the Lamar Jackson-Derrick Henry older duo that smashed for the nearby Ravens in 2024.\n\nThe Cardinals saw James Conner break down from his volume and backup Trey Benson also couldn't stay healthy, leaving an ineffective mixed fill-in bag of Bam Knight, Emari Demercado and Michael Carter. Conner will turn 31 in May and has plenty of wear. Love would be the ideal replacement to help whoever's the QB.\n\nMORE: Where Jeremiyah Love projects in SN's latest mock draft\n\nThe Jets may be trending toward moving on from Breece Hall, a pending free agent. Or they could try to keep Hall and draft someone for a dangerous 1-2 punch in the running game, given Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand saw first-hand the major effect of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs to revive the Lions' offense. Either way, bringing some Love to New York would be an option, given the Jets have two first-rounders.\n\nThe Vikings have seen Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason toggle between injury issues and getting a more reliable running game would be huge to take pressure off J.J. McCarthy or whoever their starting QB will be. Love can also provide an extra explosive element for Kevin O'Connell to better open up the passing game.",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza mock draft projection: Will Indiana QB go No. 1 overall in 2026 NFL Draft? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza wasn't expected to be the top quarterback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft. Following his surprise Heisman Trophy-caliber 2025 season at Indiana, however, now he will be taken high in the first round as the first QB off the board on April 23.\n\nWhy has Mendoza shot up draft boards for his play, and what's his pro outlook?\n\nHere's a profile of the Hoosiers passer, including what teams are most likely to draft him:\n\nMORE: The case for and against Fernando Mendoza for the Heisman\n\nMendoza (6-5, 225) has the ideal size as a strong pocket passer. The Cal transfer and Miami high school product was a hit in Curt Cignetti's dynamic offense. He's developed all the physical and mental qualities to be a top-10 pick for a QB-needy team.\n\nMendoza is very accurate with his short-to-intermediate passing. He is a good decision-maker who processes the field well. When he has a clean pocket, he can make all the throws. He also hangs tough in the pocket when facing pressure and is fearless in his execution. Mendoza is an aggressive thrower, but also avoids forcing the ball into coverage. He can zip it to take shots, but also adjust to show touch on passes when needed.\n\nMendoza can scramble for yardage when the defense breaks down and his big frame can help him on quarterback sneaks, but he won't add an element of plus athleticism to a team, as he's far less comfortable throwing on the run and won't provide any designed support for the running game. He will need to learn better how to dissect more complex pressure and coverage schemes in the NFL.\n\nMORE: College football bowl picks, predictions for CFP games\n\nWith the Giants (Jaxson Dart) and Titans (Cam Ward) taking first-round QBs in 2025, it's pretty clear where Mendoza might be headed. Here are the five teams to watch most to draft him\n\nWith Chip Kelly gone from the offense, Pete Carroll can look for a new OC with a pocket passer in mind to replace Geno Smith. It doesn't hurt that Mendoza's Big Ten clutch style would get a stamp of approval from part-owner Tom Brady.\n\nThe Browns will learn more about Shedeur Sanders for the rest of the 2025 season to see whether the rookie fifth-rounder deserves a more extended look to start in '26. If not, Cleveland would be firm play to try again at franchise QB.\n\nMORE: Where Fernando Mendoza projects in SN's latest mock draft\n\nWill the Saints see enough from Tyler Shough to make a call either way on the second-round rookie QB? If they want to go higher into the draft pool for offensive-minded Kellen Moore, Mendoza has the Dak Prescott-like pocket qualities to execute his offense well.\n\nAaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand saw the success of pocket-passing winning with Jared Goff (6-4, 217) in Detroit and may want to go that route to try again to strengthen the position for the long haul.\n\nThe Cardinals are heading to part ways with Kyler Murray and there might be some offensive coaching changes in store, too. Mendoza, Marvin Harrison Jr., Trey McBride and Michael Wilson would make for a good young passing game foundation.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "title": "Can a nepo baby be an underdog? The remarkable rise of Shedeur Sanders",
    "description": "The quarterback was seen as living off his father’s name when he entered the NFL. But he has slowly started to prove himself at the Cleveland Browns",
    "fullText": "It seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, the Cleveland Browns’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.\n\nHe excelled at two colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most dramatic stock crashes in league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.\n\nEarlier this week Sanders was named the Browns starter for the rest of the season, inviting even more scrutiny of a an already polarizing player. His supporters say Sanders is entitled to his shot; his critics say he lacks the skills to play in the NFL, question his attitude and paint him as a spoiled rich kid. Every argument seems to excavate deeper feelings about Deion Sanders, his Prime Time father who paved the way for his son’s success. In the age of the nepo baby, Shedeur makes for a strange underdog story.\n\nThere are expectations that come with being a starting quarterback in the NFL, after all. In addition to the requisite physical attributes and arm talent, the cliche dictates that quarterbacks are men of character – players who speak in the first person plural, deflect credit, absorb blame and lead with modesty. It’s how the quarterback position became shorthand for a standard of American leadership that was largely reserved for conservative white men until recently. But Shedeur doesn’t even resemble the Black quarterbacks who have in the last few years broken from that tradition and transformed the league. Instead, in character at least, he resembles his father. Deion is a flashy, brash and supremely self-confident two-sport superstar universally recognized as one of the best players in NFL history.\n\nAfter becoming the first Browns quarterback to win his first start since the team’s 1999 relaunch, a soundbite of Shedeur effectively congratulating himself for playing well despite his limited practice time overshadowed the more diplomatic remarks he’d make in praise of the team later. (“Imagine what a full offseason looks like,” he beamed. “It gets dangerous!”) When he was asked last Sunday if a botched two-point conversion attempt had worked during practice, he laughed. (“I don’t think you call plays in a game that didn’t work in practice,” he cracked.) After being criticized for his remarks in the media earlier this season, he was asked about the Browns’ quarterback situation. Sanders repeatedly answered by grinning and then silently moving his mouth in response – which had fans jokingly referring to him as Mime Time in a nod to his father.\n\n“We want our quarterbacks to be very, very humble,” says Louis Moore, the Michigan State history professor and author of The Great Black Hope: Doug Williams, Vince Evans, and the Making of the Black Quarterback. “He’s not that. He’s grown up believing that he’s allowed to have confidence in himself. The world beats down a lot of young Black kids, and Deion never let it happen.”\n\nThe biased nature of the scrutiny on Shedeur, especially when things don’t go his way, often results in fans bringing up racism. They further wonder whether Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski holds a grudge against the Sanders family because his father-in-law, Tim McCarver, had an infamous run-in with Deion during the latter’s baseball career.\n\nBut the issue isn’t quite so black and white. Somehow, the Sanders family manage to inspire Obama-level respect and enthusiasm among Black Americans (who helped make Shedeur’s Browns jersey a bestseller) while also having Donald Trump in their corner. The current president hasn’t hesitated to cannonball into the Shedeur Sanders discourse, calling NFL owners “stupid” for letting him fall in the draft and trumpeting “I TOLD YOU SO!” on social media after Shedeur led the Browns past the Raiders. Trump couldn’t let those moments pass without making some mention of Shedeur’s “exceptional genes” in what was otherwise a forceful show of support.\n\n“I’m just thankful for [Trump] even taking time out of his day to speak out,” said Shedeur, reveling in his nepo baby status. While Peyton Manning was determined to overshadow his father Archie’s fruitless years with the New Orleans Saints and Bronny James shrinks from the allusions to the more prominent Lakers player in his family, Shedeur has been happy to share a spotlight with his famous father for more than a decade.\n\nA good chunk of his adolescence was documented on Deion’s Family Playbook, a reality TV series that ran on Oprah’s cable channel. Shedeur then played under his father when Deion coached at Mississippi’s Jackson State University and the University of Colorado, and the pair were instrumental in reviving both of those programs. Wherever Shedeur goes, there’s usually a camera following him – and oftentimes his older brother Deion Sanders Jr, the architect of the family’s vast online media presence, is the one holding the camera. Around family, Shedeur reverts from a football star to a little brother who gets razzed about his fashion choices and his position on his father’s sibling power rankings.\n\nBeing Deion Sanders’s son made Shedeur savvy to how NFL storylines are shaped, and the one he’s crafted about himself strikes the media – who are used to taking charge of the narrative – as presumptuous. He calls himself “legendary”, shrugs off brickbats (“You think I’m worried about what critics say?”) and throws words like “destiny” around when projecting his career path. Resentments linger about his starry approach to the draft process that may well have cost him the chance to be picked higher. It was thought that Deion was the one quarterbacking things behind the scenes at this year’s draft, but he has since revealed that it was Shedeur who may have rebuffed higher draft opportunities in Philadelphia and Baltimore because he didn’t want to sit behind two established starters, Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson – a pretty smart read as it turns out.\n\n“I know the fight behind the fight,” Deion Sanders said earlier this season. “I know what’s been transpiring behind the curtains, and I’m just proud of him. Because he’s not just saying the right things, he’s doing and living the right things. That’s just who he is … He’s a Sanders.”\n\nShedeur has only played in four NFL games, two of those against bad teams, which is too small a sample size to make concrete pronouncements about his career. But his performances so far for the Browns, a team who have sunk the careers of countless quarterbacks, hint that he is dramatically better than his lowly draft position suggests. And while his chance to finish out the season is the first true vote of confidence he has received since joining the organization, there’s a sense that he isn’t so much playing for his Browns future as he is playing for the chance to thrive elsewhere. That’s because the Browns made a $230m commitment to the injured Deshaun Watson and are determined to see if they can get their money’s worth when he returns to fitness. With this season long lost, really all that Shedeur has to play for is trade value, pride and teammate Myles Garrett shattering the single-season sack record – but of course that’s the popular spin.\n\nFor Shedeur, it’s just the latest chapter in a story that ends with him going down as the one of the biggest underdog success stories in sports – the draft afterthought who became an NFL legend. (Sound familiar?) That dissonance of an underdog with privilege shows the extent to which nepo babies have taken over the narrative.",

    "title": "Browns vs. Titans: 5 takeaways from Cleveland's NFL Week 14 loss",
    "description": "The Browns lost yet another one, and this time to the measly Titans. So, yeah, we have some thoughts.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns' 31-29 loss to the Tennessee Titans in Week 14 was a study in frustrating contradictions.\n\nOn one hand, the team showed flashes of a potentially bright future, particularly on the offensive side of the ball. Rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a statistical performance that should give the organization and its fans genuine hope for the future, leading the offense on a thrilling, if ultimately incomplete, fourth-quarter comeback attempt. His connection with fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. was explosive and dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the loss starkly illuminated the systemic flaws that have plagued the Browns throughout this disappointing season. The defense, usually a bedrock of strength, struggled significantly, particularly against the run game, allowing a career-day for Titans running back Tony Pollard. Furthermore, the persistent issues on the offensive line and costly mistakes, including a momentum-killing interception and two failed two-point conversions, proved to be the difference against a struggling Titans team.\n\nThis defeat, dropping the Browns to 3-10, was a painful reminder that potential, even when dazzling, is no substitute for consistency and flawless execution, especially when facing a team desperate for a win.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the snowy, frustrating afternoon at Huntington Bank Field.\n\nShedeur Sanders showed another significant step in his development on Sunday, logging the best statistical game by a rookie quarterback this year with 364 yards passing and three touchdowns, plus a rushing score.\n\n23/42, 364 pass yds, 3 pass td, 29 rush yds, 1 rush td, 1 int\n\nmore highlights on https://t.co/xMzvHOeNay pic.twitter.com/mfCA7cgkGc\n\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 8, 2025\n\nSanders showed up when the team called his number, orchestrating two late touchdown drives. However, the one play he definitely wants back is a costly third-quarter interception on what looked to be a scramble drill attempt, where he overshot his man, flipping the game's momentum.\n\nSanders is still holding onto the ball longer and more often than any other quarterback in the league, leading to unnecessary pressure, sacks, and backbreaking turnovers. But if his can be ironed out further and his internal clock can be sped up, the Browns might just have their future quarterback already at the helm, proving he can handle the NFL stage.\n\nThe rookie tight end out of Bowling Green, Harold Fannin Jr., continued his impressive run as a leading pass-catcher for the Browns.\n\nFannin racked up 114 yards and a touchdown on eight receptions against the Titans, marking a career-high for the young player and joining Ozzie Newsome as the only rookie tight ends in Browns history to record a 100-yard receiving game.\n\nHis blend of size, hands, and route-running ability makes him a matchup nightmare, and he is quickly solidifying his place as a core component of the Browns' offense for years to come. In an offense struggling for consistent playmakers, Fannin Jr.'s emergence is a major win.\n\nLinebacker Devin Bush has been lights out for Jim Schwartz's defense this season.\n\nAgainst the Titans, he added a key interception to his stat sheet, reading quarterback Cam Ward's eyes perfectly for a 44-yard return that set up a Browns scoring drive. Bush is playing like the dynamic, first-round pick the Steelers thought they were getting out of Michigan all those years ago.\n\nDevin Bush intercepts Cam Ward!\n\nTENvsCLE on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/adKxo8zSCL\n\nIn a league that values three-down linebackers, his strong, consistent performance this year, especially in coverage, has positioned him for a substantial contract in the upcoming free agency period.\n\nThe myth of the weather advantage was definitively debunked on Sunday. As the snow fell, the Titans' lead grew, largely due to the Browns' defense slipping and sliding all over the grass.\n\nThe conditions seemed to hamper Cleveland’s pursuit angles and tackling, leading to a career game from Titans running back Tony Pollard, who ran for 161 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nTony Pollard 65-yard TOUCHDOWN.\n\nTENvsCLE on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/UZ9c5ifvfN\n\nThe Titans' effective ground-and-pound strategy mitigated the Browns' fearsome pass rush, turning the supposed home-field edge into a distinct disadvantage for the defense.\n\nWhile Shedeur Sanders' tendency to hold onto the ball for a long time certainly allows for more pressure to be created, the offensive line is not without blame.\n\nThe unit's lack of consistency in play and availability has been a recurring and season-long problem, culminating in a performance where key starters suffered significant injuries. With starting center Ethan Pocic reportedly suffering a likely season-ending Achilles injury and other starters battling injuries, the unit is in shambles.\n\nThe team is likely looking to replace four of the five starters this offseason. A number that could be jumping to five of five if veteran left guard Joel Bitonio finally decides to hang up the cleats at season's end.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns vs. Titans: 5 takeaways from Cleveland's NFL Week 14 loss",

    "description": "The Bills are two games behind New England but favored to win.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are tied for the best record in the NFL. And yet, they're not even favored at home this week.\n\nAn oddsmaker's power ranking doesn't always match public perception or a team's record. The Buffalo Bills are very unlikely to win the AFC East but they are still the favorites to win the AFC. The Bills have the shortest odds to win the conference at +375. That belief in the Bills is reflected in this week's point spread.\n\nThe Bills, who lost to the Patriots at home back in Week 5 and are two games behind New England in the standings, are 1-point favorites at BetMGM vs. the Patriots on Sunday. That's an interesting line.\n\nThe Patriots have been slighted a bit for playing the easiest schedule in the NFL so far this season, but winning 10 games in a row is difficult no matter the opposition. And the Patriots do have good road wins at Buffalo and at Tampa Bay. The Bills have Josh Allen, but they haven't been great. They have bad blowout losses to the Falcons and Dolphins. Last week they were in danger of losing to the Bengals at home until Christian Benford had a magical pick-6 and turned the game around. You can pick holes in New England's season if you wish, but the same can be done to the Bills. On top of it all, the Patriots are well rested coming off their bye week.\n\nMaybe Josh Allen plays the superhero role and keeps the Bills' chances at an AFC East title alive (the Patriots clinch the division title with a win on Sunday) but we'll give some respect to the Patriots and make them the pick at +1. It seems like getting proper respect won't be easy for this Pats team.\n\nHere are the rest of the picks for Week 15 in the NFL, with odds from BetMGM:\n\nIt's hard to back either team. The Bucs are coming off a miserable loss to the Saints, and their offense is in a slump. More specifically, Baker Mayfield is in a slump. His rating the last four games is 65.2. On the other side, the Falcons have lost seven of eight, and the last two gams were a loss to the lowly Jets and a 28-point loss to the Seahawks. But, we have to pick one of them.\n\nThe Bengals beat the Ravens 32-14 on Thanksgiving, in Baltimore. Not much has changed since. The Ravens are showing, week after week, they're not very good. So why are they favored here? Theoretically the Ravens could suddenly emerge as the stellar team everyone though they would be this season, but we've been waiting for that for months and it hasn't happened.\n\nIt seemed last week like the Commanders had one good performance left in them this season, and it came two weeks ago in a crushing overtime loss to the Broncos. Last week's effort against the Vikings was startlingly bad. They might already have their luggage packed for the trip to Cancun. The Giants aren't great either but they are rested after a bye.\n\nThere will be a few instances this week of teams in look-ahead spots. It's not all that common in the NFL, but how will the Bears get up to face the Browns when they know the Packers are coming to town six days later? The Browns have a good defense and until the past couple weeks, the theme of the Bears season was having a bunch of close wins, mostly over bad teams.\n\nThe only reason to believe in the Chiefs laying this many points is the argument that they are in must-win mode. But they've been in must-win mode for weeks. It hasn't mattered. The Chiefs aren't as bad as their 6-7 record (they're No. 6 in DVOA, haters) but this line seems a point or two too high. Would it be that surprising to see the Chargers win straight up?\n\nThe Eagles look broken and the Raiders are the NFL's worst team. What fun. Geno Smith is unlikely to start this week for the Raiders, which actually might not be a bad thing. Still, I can't take the Raiders. If there was ever a get-right spot for the Eagles, this is it. If they struggle here, they're really in trouble.\n\nBrady Cook might get the start for the Jets because Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor are hurt. Cook is an undrafted rookie who threw for 11 touchdowns in 12 games last season at Missouri. He'd be operating in an offense that hasn't been good no matter who is playing at quarterback. Anything seems possible in this weird NFL season, but this is a bad spot for the Jets.\n\nThe problem with taking the Cardinals is it's hard to figure out how they score on the NFL's best defense. But it's not like the Texans offense is a scoring bonanza either. Last week we took the Cardinals, based on the fact that a large number of their losses have been close. It didn't work out last week. Let's try again.\n\nThe Broncos certainly aren't without flaws, but a 2.5-point home underdog? That's surprising. Both 11-2 teams are underdogs at home this week, which says a lot about the wide-open nature of the NFL this season. Another factor in backing Denver: The Packers play at Chicago in Week 16 for what practically amounts to the NFC North title game. It shouldn't surprise anyone if they have an eye on that game.\n\nThis one is an even more extreme look-ahead spot. The Rams play at Seattle four days after this game in a meeting that could determine the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The Rams are a veteran team with a great coach, but how could they not be thinking a little bit about that game? Also, the Lions have extra rest after playing on Thursday night, which is usually an edge. Even if the Rams play well, the Lions have a good enough offense to always be in play for a backdoor cover. Be careful if you're taking the Rams here.\n\nThe Panthers have had a really weird season, with multiple quality wins and some miserable losses. One of those losses came to the Saints, and it wasn't all that close with New Orleans thoroughly outplaying Carolina in a 17-7 game. How could we know which Panthers team will show up? We'll hope for the one that is fighting for a division title late in the season.\n\nThe Titans have actually covered the spread in four of their last five games. It's not a good team but one that is still playing hard. The 49ers should blast the Titans. But that's not how the NFL typically works.\n\nThe Colts have eight wins and it wasn't just because of Daniel Jones. It has been a pretty good team this season, despite a recent slide. Yes, it's scary to depend on 44-year-old Philip Rivers or whoever plays quarterback against one of the NFL's best defenses. It could get ugly. But as is said often in this space, double-digit underdogs usually look hopeless, and then they somehow cover.\n\nProof that it would take a court order for the networks to flex a Cowboys game out of prime time. It's time to test whether Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy is turning a corner. He looked good last week, but that came against a really bad Commanders defense. If he can go on the road and have another positive outing against a Cowboys defense that has been better since the Quinnen Williams trade, maybe the narrative surrounding him will start to change. But let's see it happen first.\n\nThis is a strangely interesting game. The Dolphins started 1-6 but have rallied and aren't dead in the playoff race at 6-7. The Steelers can have some awful games, but they lead the AFC North at 7-6. It's a test for that Dolphins hot streak, considering they've been mostly beating bad teams and doing it with Tua Tagovailoa producing very little.",

Players become eligible five years after ending their career and, in his first year of eligibility, Rivers has been named a semi-finalist for the class of 2026.\n\nIf he remains on the Colts' practice squad, he will maintain his eligibility, but if he is elevated to the active roster, he will not be eligible again until the class of 2031.",

After playing games in the German city in both 2022 and 2024, the NFL announced Wednesday it will return to Munich in both 2026 and 2028 for regular-season games.\n\nThe move is part of a multiyear partnership with both the city of Munich and FC Bayern Munich. Games will be hosted at Allianz Arena, where FC Bayern Munich plays its home games.\n\nThe NFL today announced it will return to Munich, Germany in 2026 and 2028 to play regular season games, as part of a multi-year partnership with the City of Munich and FC Bayern Munich.\n\nThe games will be played at the FC Bayern Munich Stadium.\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 10, 2025\n\nFC Bayern Munich confirmed the partnership, with the mayor of Munich, Verena Dietl, expressing excitement over \"spreading the enthusiasm\" for American football in the city.\n\n\"I’m delighted about the extension of our contract with the NFL and it once again shows the importance and strength of Munich as a sporting city. The previous games not only won the hearts of the fans, but also strengthened our successful cooperation with the NFL. Together, we’re committed to promoting American football in Germany and spreading the enthusiasm for the sport far beyond the stadiums. I'm looking forward to the upcoming games in 2026 and 2028, which will not only bring top-class sport, but also valuable impetus for grassroots sport in our city.\"\n\nThe NFL has played regular-season games in Munich two other times. The Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers played at Allianz Arena in 2022, with the Bucs coming out on top. Two years later, the Carolina Panthers beat the New York Giants in Munich.\n\nGermany is no stranger to hosting NFL games at this point. In addition to those two contests, the Indianapolis Colts and Atlanta Falcons played a regular season game in Berlin, Germany earlier this year. The Colts won thanks to a tremendous performance from running back Jonathan Taylor.\n\nThe NFL has not announced which teams will take part in the Munich game in 2026 or 2028.\n\nIn recent years, the NFL has pushed to expand play outside the United States. The league has scheduled a number of international games each year, with six taking place during the 2025 NFL season. The NFL has played at least one game in the United Kingdom regularly since the 2007 season and has expanded international play to Brazil, Spain and Mexico, among other countries, in recent seasons.\n\nThe 2026 Munich game marks one of six international games announced by the NFL for next season. In addition to playing in Germany next year, the NFL will also play in Australia, Brazil and Mexico. The league will also play two games in the United Kingdom in 2026.\n\nThe league announced the Los Angeles Rams will play in the Australia game and that the Jacksonville Jaguars will appear in one of the games in the United Kingdom, but have not revealed any other teams taking part in international games next season.",

    "description": "We’re back in the top 10 baybeee",
    "fullText": "As Week 15 approaches, we rounded up the latest NFL power rankings to get a sense of how the Jaguars are viewed nationally.\n\nTrevor Lawrence has taken major strides the past two weeks. It’s all starting to click in the new offense.\n\nThey played once at Levi’s Stadium this year. Could they be returning?\n\nMost shocking statistical ranking: Wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr . is 50th in receiving yards\n\nExpectations were pretty high for Thomas after a big rookie season — 1,282 yards (third in the NFL) and 10 TDs — but he has had issues catching the ball (five drops) and rookie Travis Hunter moved ahead of Thomas into the No. 1 receiver role by Week 7 before Hunter ‘s season-ending injury. Thomas did miss three games because of an ankle injury and has had five catches for 115 yards in the two games since his return. But the team now views Jakobi Meyers — whom they traded for on Nov. 4 — as its No. 1 wideout. Thomas has 535 receiving yards so far.\n\nThey’re holding steady at No. 9 − and now firmly atop the AFC South with fifth-year QB Trevor Lawrence playing his most efficient football of the season heading into the stretch drive.\n\nNothing about Jacksonville’s successful season has felt intentional, let alone sustainable, but I think that the Jaguars are turning the corner. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has finally found a good rhythm in the passing game, his receivers are catching the ball again, and the playoff picture is shaping up for the Jags to win a game or two this postseason.\n\nAfter saying all that, I’m positive that this team will repay my belief by embarrassing itself in the next couple of weeks.\n\nBeating the Colts was huge and probably wrapped up the AFC South for them. Still, it’s hard not to wonder how the game would’ve played out if Indy hadn’t lost QB Daniel Jones.\n\nIf you were to ask me to identify Jacksonville’s superpower, I’d probably stumble my way through an answer before mentioning the run defense. But once Daniel Jones was knocked out of Sunday’s game, the Jaguars flexed their muscles and put the Colts away to wrest temporary control of the division. The Texans are coming, but these Jaguars are making things work in Liam Coen’s first season. He might be running third in the Coach of the Year race behind Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson, but Coen’s offense looked nice early against Indy before slowing down after halftime. All in all, though, this team is playing good football at the right time. Jacksonville has allowed just 13 points per game over the past four, and it’s looking like the Jags could face undrafted rookie Brady Cook at QB when the Jets come to town this Sunday.\n\nThe Jaguars took control of the NFC South on Sunday, and there’s a good chance they secure their first division title since 2022 by winning three of their final four games.\n\nWith Daniel Jones injured for Indianapolis, the Denver Broncos are probably the only playoff-caliber challenge left on Jacksonville’s schedule. If the Jags don’t play down to the competition against the Colts, Jets and Titans, they’ll host a playoff game.\n\nHow Jacksonville actually fares in the postseason will hinge on Trevor Lawrence’s play and the defense’s ability to force turnovers. The Jaguars haven’t won the turnover battle and lost a game since Week 2.\n\nAs wrong as I was about how Ben Johnson’s demeanor was going to translate to leading an NFL locker room, I may have been equally wrong about Liam Coen. Just look at the immaculate vibes taking place here.\n\nSunday changed everything in the AFC South. The Colts lost Daniel Jones, and the Jaguars picked up a critical win. It’s hard to watch the Jaguars and Texans and believe Jacksonville is the better team right now (more on the Texans in a bit) but they do lead the division. The AFC South might come down to whether the Jaguars can beat the Broncos or the Texans can beat the Chargers, because the other remaining games for both teams are all winnable.\n\nFrom Josh Kendall and Chad Graff:\n\nThe Jaguars’ first-year coach is in a neck-and-neck race with the Bears’ Ben Johnson for the most performative postgame locker room speeches. After Jacksonville won for the fifth time in six games Sunday, Coen looked on the verge of breaking his players’ hands high-fiving. He has the players believing, though. Josh Hines-Allen was even talking about the Super Bowl after recording his seventh sack.\n\nThe Jaguars’ average rank this week is 9.6 (last week: 11.2).\n\nThe #Jaguars keep on climbing pic.twitter.com/mJqYwcOuw0\n\n— Duval 22 (@duval22dotcom) December 10, 2025\n\nWhere would you rank the team, Jaguars fans?

    "description": "The career of National Football League kicker Brett Maher, one marked by both record-setting successes and public failures, offers useful insights for professionals facing high-pressure situations. In particular Maher employed three core practices: tuning out external criticism, focusing on process over outcomes, and embracing reflection and routine. Leaders under stress can use the same approaches to maintain composure, resilience, and continuous improvement when stakes are high.",

Over his decade as a professional athlete, he made 79.9% of the field goals he attempted and 95.5% of the extra points. And yet he was also released by 12 teams.",

    "description": "Mendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also probably be a top candidate for a job in finance.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",
