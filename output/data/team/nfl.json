    "fullText": "Joe Burrow woke up from a social media slumber on Monday to weigh in on a pair of calls that sparked controversy in this weekend's divisional round playoff games.\n\nAs far as he's concerned, there is no controversy.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals quarterback tweeted a defense of game officials for their rulings on \"two plays\" that he declared \"were not difficult calls.\"\n\nHe mentions two plays \"yesterday,\" but is almost certainly referencing a late interception on a contested ball in the Broncos' divisional round playoff win over the Bills on Saturday and another play on a contested ball Sunday that was ruled a catch for Los Angeles receiver Davante Adams in the Rams' win over the Bears.\n\n\"The amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me,\" Burrow wrote. \"And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.\"\n\nThe amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me. And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.\n\n— Joey Burrow (@JoeyB) January 19, 2026\n\nOther than a retweet of a Netflix post promoting a show about him, that was Burrow's first tweet since April 26, 2024. He apparently feels strongly about this.\n\nThe first play in question was Ja'Quan McMillian's interception of Josh Allen in overtime of Denver's 33-30 win Saturday night. Bills receiver Brandin Cooks secured the ball in his hands on a deep pass that would have set the Bills up in position for a game-winning field goal.\n\nCooks was diving to the ground as he made the catch and still had the ball in his hands when his knee hit the turf. But McMillian had tight coverage and snatched the ball from Cooks' grasp after they hit the ground. He stood up with possession of the ball, and officials awarded him an interception. Denver drove for the game-winning field goal on its ensuing drive.\n\nWOW!! Interception Josh Allen on this crazy play pic.twitter.com/J7UyosDna5\n\n— Rate the Refs (@Rate_the_Refs) January 18, 2026\n\nOn the second play in question, Adams caught a ball in traffic in a tie game in the fourth quarter of Sunday's Rams-Bears divisional matchup.\n\nHe didn't take a step after securing the ball and was immediately taken down to the turf by a pair of Bears defenders. As his knee hit the turf, Bears defensive back Tyrique Stevenson had his hand on the ball, which was still in Adams' grasp. Stevenson then stripped the ball from Adams before Adams fully hit the ground.\n\nHow is this a catch from Davante Adams but the Brandin Cooks play wasn’t?\n\n*Both plays are catches fyi #BillsMafia | #GoBills \n pic.twitter.com/UWz2dkuTqU\n\n— Peter DiBiasi (@DibiasiPeter) January 19, 2026\n\nOn this play, Adams was awarded a catch. The Rams went on to score a touchdown on the drive for a 17-10 lead en route to a 20-17 overtime win.\n\nNBC rules analyst Terry McAulay agreed with the call on the field on the broadcast. He also was watching Saturday night and tweeted his agreement of the call on McMillian's interception. Per McAulay, Adams made a football act \"common to the game\" on his play that was enough to rule it a complete catch before his knee hit the ground.\n\n\"He clearly completed the catch on this one,\" McAulay said. \"He has it long enough to perform an act common to the game, and then he goes to the ground, and his knee goes down prior to him losing control.\"\n\nIn the case of McMillian's interception, Cooks was diving to the ground and, per McAulay, didn't establish a completed catch before his knee hit the ground, allowing McMillian to strip the ball for the turnover.\n\n\"A player going to the ground to catch a pass must maintain control during and after contact with the ground,\" McAulay wrote. That's the rule. Apply accordingly.\"\n\nBurrow didn't go into further details beyond his initial tweet, but it's safe to assume that he agrees with McAulay's interpretation of the rules. And those were the same conclusions that officials on the field reached in both games.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bears' 2025-26 NFL postseason run came to a close Sunday night from a chilly Soldier Field, as the Los Angeles Rams took advantage of a Caleb Williams interception in a 17-17 overtime period that led to the Rams' eventual game-winning 42-yard field goal from kicker Harrison Mevis to send them to the NFC Championship next Sunday vs. the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe game never reaches the extra session, however, without Williams' late-game heroics. The Bears put together one last drive late in the fourth quarter, needing to convert a fourth-and-4 to keep the season afloat.

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills’ 2025-2026 NFL season ended in heartbreak, and quarterback Josh Allen did not hide the toll it took on him. Following the Bills’ playoff loss to the Denver Broncos, Allen cried while addressing reporters, apologizing to his teammates and expressing disappointment over how the season concluded.\n\nThe Bills’ campaign came to an end on January 17, after a defeat to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round. Speaking at the post-game press conference, Josh Allen struggled to hold back tears as he addressed the result and his mindset following the loss. “It’s extremely difficult,” Allen said. He continued, “I feel like I let my teammates down tonight.”\n\nWhen asked why the defeat affected him so profoundly, Allen explained that the game featured several moments the team failed to capitalize on. He said there were “missed opportunities throughout the game,” before adding, “It’s been a long season. I hate how it ended, and that’s gonna stick with me for a long time.”\n\nJosh Allen also addressed what he told his teammates in the immediate aftermath of the loss, making it clear that emotions were still raw in the locker room. “I haven’t been doing a lot of talking,” Allen admitted. “I love my teammates, and I’m extremely sorry, and I’m extremely disappointed in how this ended,” he continued. The game itself ended in overtime, when Will Lutz converted a 24-yard field goal to secure the win for the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe press conference also came at a meaningful time in Allen’s personal life, as his wife, Hailee Steinfeld, is currently pregnant and expecting the couple’s first child.\n\nWith the victory, Denver advanced to the AFC Championship Game, where the top-seeded team will face either the New England Patriots or the Houston Texans on January 25. The opponent will be determined following the Patriots-Texans matchup on January 18.\n\nThe post Bills’ Josh Allen Cries After Loss: ‘I Let My Teammates Down’ appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — Caleb Williams' last throw in regulation was a backpedaling, fourth-down rainbow that landed in Cole Kmet's hands in the corner of the end zone for a breathtaking touchdown.\n\nHis last throw of the game was the beginning of the end for Chicago's surprising season.\n\nWilliams almost rallied the Bears to another memorable win on Sunday night. But he threw his third interception in overtime and Matthew Stafford drove the Los Angeles Rams to Harrison Mevis' winning field goal in a 20-17 victory in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\n“It's tough. In these moments, you feel that you let your team down,” Williams said. “You feel this or that. It’s a good lesson learned for us, first time being in this situation for me and for us as a team. I’m excited for what’s to come. But obviously going to go back and watch this and figure out how I can be better, and that’s the exciting part.”\n\nThe 24-year-old Williams led Chicago to an NFL-record seven wins this season when trailing in last 2 minutes of regulation. He threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 left in a 31-27 victory over Green Bay in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThis time, the Bears (12-7) were losing 17-10 when they got the ball back with 1:50 left in the fourth quarter. And, just like before, Williams delivered.\n\nFacing a fourth-and-4 at the Rams 14 with 27 seconds left, Williams took a shotgun snap and surveyed the field. The No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft was forced to backpedal as the pocket collapsed, and he scampered all the way back to the 40 with Jared Verse, Josaiah Stewart and Braden Fiske all in pursuit for the Rams.\n\nWilliams turned, saw Kmet in the end zone and threw the ball in his direction just as Verse and Stewart got to the second-year QB.\n\n“I ended up getting a little bit of pressure, so try and break contain and just break angles and slow those guys down so that when I do turn around, I can have a little bit more time possibly to find somebody,” Williams said, “and they did a good job containing me, so I just gained a little bit more depth, and I saw Cole one-on-one over there.”\n\nKmet wrestled with Rams cornerback Cobie Turner before hauling in the pass, sending a charge through the crowd of 60,253 on a frigid night at Soldier Field.\n\n“It felt like a pretty easy pitch-and-catch and kind of felt like it was in slow motion,” Kmet said. “I can’t believe Caleb.”\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson called the throw “ridiculous.”\n\n“There’s some things that you just can’t coach. ... He’s got a knack, he’s clutch,” Johnson said.\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Williams' pass traveled 51.2 yards in the air for the longest completed pass by air distance in the red zone since at least 2016. He made the throw from 26.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage; no quarterback since 2016, according to Next Gen Stats, had completed a pass from a depth of more than 22 yards.\n\nIt had a completion probability of 17.8%.\n\n“It was the most special throw that I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen him do that so many times this year,” Bears safety Kevin Byard said.\n\nWilliams also threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Moore on fourth down on the first play of the second quarter. But his three interceptions were costly.\n\nThe Bears had a chance to win the game in overtime. They drove to the Los Angeles 48 before Williams was picked off by Rams safety Kam Curl on a deep ball intended for Moore.\n\n“Just a miscommunication between him and I,” Williams said. \"Tried to flatten him off under the safety, and he kept it vertical from what I saw, obviously, in the moment.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "Here's how the teams in the AFC and NFC title games stack up against each other.",
    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Three reasons Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will (and won't) win Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWho will win Super Bowl 60? The wide-open 2025-2026 NFL playoffs started with a combined 14 teams from the AFC and NFC, but it's down to four with the conference championship matchups now set for next Sunday.\n\nThe AFC has held form, with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos (14-3) ready to host the No. 2 seed New England Patriots (14-3). The best team in the NFC, the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks (14-3) will host the No. 5 Los Angeles Rams (12-5) in another NFC West rubber match.\n\nAny one of those teams can either win the Super Bowl or fall flat in the league semifinals. Based on each team's odds to finish the playoffs undefeated and raise the Lombardi Trophy, here's looking at why the Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will succeed or fail through the last two rounds:\n\n(Futures odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Seahawks led the NFL scoring defense (16.6 points allowed per game) and were third in total defense (282.8 yards per game) during the regular season. They were No. 2 against the run (92.6 yards per game) and No. 9 against the pass (190.3). They lived up to that reputation and then some in obliterating the 49ers in the divisional round of the playoffs, 41-6.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks smacked 49ers behind dominant defense\n\nThey are in sync with the pressure and coverage and just erased San Francisco's running game. Outside of some issues covering backs and tight ends, Seattle has no defensive weaknesses. They are starting to channel much of the classic \"Legion of Boom\" energy from their Super Bowl 48-winning team.\n\nThe Seahawks ran the ball on 50.6 percent of their offensive plays, No. 2 in the NFL behind only the Ravens. They were No. 7 in rushing yards per game, averaging 126.2 yards. With a blowout in the divisional round, Seattle rushed the ball at a 63.5 percent clip, producing 175 yards on 33 attempts, with Kenneth Walker III (116 yards, 3 TDs) carrying the load after Zach Charbonnet (knee) got hurt.\n\nWhen Seattle can run the ball at a high clip, it takes a lot of pressure off Sam Darnold in the passing game. With their offensive line getting great interior blocking, it's a tough rushing attack to stop.\n\nThe Seahawks' run blocking has been on point and Klint Kubiak has done well to keep the offense balanced so it maintains explosiveness, too.\n\nSam Darnold has responded in his reunion with Kubiak, playing well off the running game. It's wise to trust elite breakout wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba to make the big plays needed all the way through the end zone. Darnold has also hit on well-timed deep shots to other wideouts and made good use of his tight ends when called upon. Darnold has been fortunate to land in another QB-friendly system after his big season with Minnesota.\n\n1. Too little from the passing game\n\nDarnold is falling into the Trent Dilfer-Brad Johnson category of potential Super Bowl quarterbacks. He is more of a complementary strong supporter on a team led by defense and the running game. However, Darnold should be prepared to try to win another shootout in Seattle with Matthew Stafford after not needing to much to beat the 49ers.\n\nFor such a dominant team, the Seahawks were minus-3 in turnover margin during the regular season. They were second in the NFL with their 28 giveaways and Darnold threw 14 of Seattle's 15 interceptions. Although they crushed the 49ers in the turnover battle, 3-0, to reverse that trend, the Rams will be out looking for mistakes from Darnold.\n\nThe Seahawks were a middle of the pack offense on third down this season, converting on 39.8 percent of third-down chances. Seattle's third down struggles were highlighted in the divisional round, going 4-for-10 (40 percent) in the playoff rout of the 49ers. The Seahawks will need do better at sustaining drives or meet a playoff exit.\n\nThe Patriots' secondary was active and a big reason why they thwarted the Texans' makeshift receiving corps. C.J. Stroud saw some pressure, but his bad passes cost him because New England was opportunistic. New England also was all over ripping into Justin Herbert and his receivers in the wild-card round. The defense, not the offense, is why the Patriots remain alive, one game away from the Super Bowl.\n\nMaye got out of some his early playoff jitters and kinks against the Texans and Chargers, facing a lot more pressure in two senses and being less accurate and careful with the ball. But after a hot finish vs. Houston's brutal all-around defensive test with little help from the traditional running game, Maye should have a lot more confidence he can do what Josh Allen did in Denver to the Broncos' defense, only minus the turnovers.\n\nMORE: Why Patriots won't get away with sloppy Drake Maye vs. Bo Nix-less Broncos\n\nMike Vrabel and Josh McDaniels have proved to be strong Belichickian proxies for New England with Maye and the young defensive talent making their jobs much easier to execute at a high level. Vrabel has wasted no time returning to the ranks off top NFL coaches, picking up where left off with lesser teams in Tennessee.\n\nMaye has gotten sloppy with his ball security when running or keeping pass plays alive in the pocket. He has also thrown an interception in each of his first two playoff games, and luckily hasn't been picked off more with some anomalous inaccuracy. The Patriots must win the turnover battle all-around to win the war.\n\nMORE: Texans can't take advantage of Drake Maye's turnover troubles\n\nMaye is in Year 2. Everyone's adjusting to the Vrabel-McDaniels era after one bad transitional year with Jerod Mayo. There is some youth serving well on the defense despite its green nature. The Patriots are a facing a tight-nit Broncos' defense and would get either the swarming Seahawks or the savvier Sean McVay-led Rams in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots tend to give up touchdowns deep when their opponents can sustain long drives. They made the Texans look better in this major area of struggle on Sunday. Not holding for field goals on a couple drives can make the biggest difference for Maye and the offense moving forward.\n\nMcVay is the best coach in the NFL, considering his offensive play-calling acumen, motivational skills and situational understanding. He took advantage of a flawed field to push the team toward its first championship under him in Super Bowl 56. His offensive staff and defensive coordinator Chris Shula crush it every week, too.\n\nMORE: Why Sean McVay-Ben Johnson postgame handshake was cordial\n\n2. Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Davante Adams\n\nStafford might have more chemistry with Nacua and Adams than he did with Cooper Kupp and his other receivers four years ago. Nacua is off to a historic start with his production and Adams' red zone dominance has further stamped his Hall of Fame career. Stafford has been on point getting them the ball and it's also opened up big plays downfield and after the catch for the tight ends and other receivers.\n\n3. A strong defensive front seven\n\nThe back end of the Rams' defense has had some coverage breakdowns at corner and safety, exploitable in several matchups. The Rams won their last Super Bowl with Aaron Donald as the linchpin and Jalen Ramsey as the mercenary. Now they've a rebuilt a stout disruptive corps with Jared Verse, Kobie Turner, Braden Fiske, Nate Landman and other active youngsters.\n\n1. Not running the ball enough or effectively\n\nThe Rams have a good rushing attack, especially in short yardage and in the red zone. They stuck with the run 31 times against the Bears, with Kyren Williams scoring both of their TDs. But they averaged only 3.6 yards a carry and couldn't put the game away with the rushing attack in the fourth quarter. They can't get afford to get stuck being too one-dimensional for Stafford's sake.\n\nThe Rams made some huge interceptions against Caleb Williams to help survive in the divisional round. But they also had some major coverage breakdowns and benefitted from a few just-missed connections and drops by the Bears receivers.\n\nMcVay tends to be old-school for still being a young hotshot calling the offensive shots at age 39. For example, he could have trusted Stafford and the passing game to run out the clock with one more first down in regulation, but invited the Bears back in with a late short punt. Some tougher fourth-down calls might be required to outlast the Seahawks plus either the Patriots or Broncos.\n\nSean Payton and defensive coordinator Vance Joseph have been on point, coaching complementary football. Payton has the experience of winning Super Bowl 44 while leading the Saints and will extract the most out of his now more injury-riddled roster one last time. That includes scheming to make backup Jarrett Stidham semi-successful filling in for Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos dodged a bullet with cornerback Patrick Surtain returning vs. the Bills. They also saw more playmakers come though in the secondary behind good pressure on Allen, led by Ja'Quan McMillan in the slot corner role. Nik Bonitto and others set Denver up for success against the Bills and should be ready to tee off against Drake Maye and the Patriots.\n\nWith Nix out for the season with a broken bone in his ankle, his early legacy of being a clutch late-game quarterback may rub off with the whole team. Expect Denver to rally around Stidham to come through in the end.\n\n1. No Bo Nix and more offensive injuries\n\nStidham will likely need to go to work minus wide receivers Pat Bryant and Troy Franklin, just as the young targets were starting to come through for Nix. Now Stidham is dealing with a short-handed receiving corps on top of being rusty and jittery playing against his first NFL team at home.\n\nMORE:Why Nick Foles thinks Broncos have a chance after Bo Nix injury\n\nThe Broncos didn't find a reliable rushing attack even against the Bills' porous run defense, with Nix's scrambling leading the way in the running game. The team misses the power and juice of JK Dobbins with rookie RJ Harvey providing only some flashes without power-running substance. If the Broncos can't take pressure off Stidham with the running game vs. a nasty Patriots run defense, Stidham should be prepared to see a lot of heat in his face.\n\nSurtain and McMillan saved the day in many ways against the Bills, but the Broncos are not known for making big plays on the ball with only 10 interceptions and four fumble recoveries from the regular season. They need to be sound fundamentally for Vance Joseph and win the situational battles on third down and in the red zone. Any little crack in coverage and Maye will exploit it for chunk passes downfield with his fearless, big arm.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nConference championship weekend will determine who reaches Super Bowl 60 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8.\n\nDenver and Seattle advanced on divisional playoff weekend.\n\nThe Broncos will host the AFC championship game for the seventh time in franchise history, but the dominant storyline is the loss of Bo Nix, who suffered a broken bone in his right ankle in the 33-30 victory against Buffalo and will be replaced by Jarrett Stidham. New England beat Houston 28-16 in the AFC divisional playoffs behind second-year quarterback Drake Maye and a defense that forced four turnovers.\n\nDenver has beaten the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game in two past meetings.\n\nThe AFC championship game will be at 3 p.m. on CBS.\n\nThe Seahawks hammered the San Francisco 49ers 49-6 in the NFC divisional playoffs. Sam Darnold earned his first playoff victory, and Kenneth Walker III had three TD runs. The Rams survived a 20-17 overtime classic at Chicago in the NFC divisional round, and Matthew Stafford has a chance to get to a second Super Bowl with coach Sean McVay, who is looking for a third appearance.\n\nHere are Sporting News' picks for the AFC and NFC Championship games (odds courtesy of Caesars):\n\nNew England Patriots (-5.5) at Denver Broncos\n\nIt is a fun coaching matchup between Sean Payton and Mike Vrabel, who can take New England to the Super Bowl in his first season.\n\nStidham made two starts with coach Sean Payton in the 2023 season. How much will the Patriots speed up the seventh-year quarterback on his reads? Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions and took three sacks. The Broncos will have to rely on the running game more – which averaged just 3.2 yards per carry against the Bills. RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin need to be more effective against a Patriots’ defense that allowed 48 rushing yards against the Texans. New England’s defense that features linebackers Robert Spillane and Christian Elliss.\n\nHow much will Stidham be able to test New England in the passing game? Carlton Davis - who did not have an interception in the regular season – had two picks. The Patriots will take chances in coverage on Stidham, and Denver also has uncertainty at the receiver position. Troy Franklin suffered a hamstring injury in the divisional playoffs, and that leaves Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims and Lil’Jordan Humphrey at receiver. How much success will the Broncos have on third down in the intermediate range?\n\nBreaking down Broncos' QB depth chart behind Bo Nix\n\nCan the Broncos still win the Super Bowl without Bo Nix?\n\nGet to know new Broncos QB1, Jarrett Stidham\n\nDenver’s defense also will face more pressure to keep this a low-scoring game. Maye will be on the spot, too, especially in his first road playoff start. The Broncos generated five turnovers and three sacks against the Bills, and linebacker Nik Bonitto had a sack and two forced fumbles. There will be opportunities against Maye, who had four fumbles against the Texans, and the pressure has to land. The Patriots can lean on the running game with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, and that should help Maye settle in on the road.\n\nMaye has been trustworthy on the road this season, too. He’s 8-0 with an average 273.5 yards, 17 TDs and three interceptions on the road this season. This is Maye’s first start at Empower Field at Mile High, and the Broncos were 9-1 S/U at home this season and 2-0 S/U as a home underdog. It’s still a tough environment, and the Broncos are 6-1 S/U all time at home in the AFC championship game. Pittsburgh beat Denver 34-17 in the 2005 AFC championship game on Jan. 22, 2006.\n\nPatriots defense picks apart Texans to advance to AFC Championship\n\nC.J. Stroud's four first-half INTs doom Texans\n\nWhy Patriots can't afford another sloppy Drake Maye playoff performance\n\nWhere C.J. Stroud's disastrous day ranks among most turnovers in a playoff game\n\nCan Stidham pull a Jeff Hostettler – who led the Giants to a Super Bowl XXV victory after Phil Simms was injured. Hostettler had two regular-season starts before the playoffs. A week might not be enough time for Denver here. It’s just going to be tough to pull this off without the Patriots imploding on the road.\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\nThe two regular-season matchups were decided by a combined total of three points, including a wild 38-37 overtime thriller on Dec. 18. The NFC West rivals split the regular-season series, and three of the last four meetings at Seattle have gone into overtime.\n\nWalker is coming off a huge game, and he had 11 carries for 100 yards and a TD in the last meeting. The Rams allowed 160 rushing yards against the Bears, so Seattle can be patient with the two-headed rushing attack of Walker and Zach Charbonnet. Jared Verse has to be a difference maker off the edge for Los Angeles.\n\nThat should help Darnold – who finished 51 of 78 (65.4%) for an average of 274.5 yards, two TDs and six interceptions in the two regular-season meetings against the Rams. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 17 catches for 201 yards and a TD in those two games, and that is the matchup Seattle needs to win consistently in the passing game. Five different Los Angeles players had interceptions in those games, and the Rams intercepted Caleb Williams three times in the divisional playoff win. Turnovers will be key here, especially on the road.\n\nHow swarming Seattle defense is peaking at right time\n\nWatch Rashid Shaheed take opening kickoff for TD\n\nThis is another opportunity for Stafford, who had a 57.1% completion percentage in those two meetings but also did not take a sack. He had 457 yards and three TDs in the last meeting. Will Seattle coach Michael Macdonald choose to dial up the pressure in order to take Stafford out of rhythm with receivers Puka Nacua and Davante Adams? Tight end Cody Parkinson had 10 carries for 90 yards and a TD in two playoff games, too. The Rams also will look to establish the running game with Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. The Seahawks allowed 5.3 yards per carry in their regular-season loss in the Rams and 3.2 yards per carry in the win.\n\nThe Rams were 4-5 S/U on the road, but they are 1-1 ATS as an underdog in the regular season, but they have won S/U as a road favorite each of the last two weeks. Seattle is 8-2 S/U and 6-4 ATS at home. The Seahawks are 3-0 S/U at home in the NFC championship game.\n\nIt's shaping up to be another instant classic between these rivals, but the Rams had a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in that last meeting and they have survived two tough road games. Does Stafford have one more road victory in him? It's hard not to trust the MVP-caliber quarterback in this matchup.\n\nRams fend off Bears' comeback attempt to advance to NFC Championship\n\nCaleb Williams overtime interception dooms Bears\n\nWatch Caleb Williams uncork spectacular TD pass to Cole Kmet to force overtime",

    "description": "After the NFL regular season was spiced by debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to have such drama.",
    "fullText": "Even worse for the heartbroken Buffalo Bills as Ja’Quan McMillian ripped the football away from Brandin Cooks for the interception that gave the Denver Broncos new life in overtime of the Jan. 17 AFC divisional playoff game was the sight of back judge Scott Helverson instantly signaling a turnover.\n\nRather than a 39-yard completion that could have set up a potential game-winning field goal, the Bills saw victory snatched from their grasp in a hail of controversy.\n\nThe ruling from New York – where the NFL reviews all turnovers from its officiating command center at league headquarters – didn’t make it better for the Bills Mafia.\n\nAnd it will linger as another symbol of frustration for a franchise that has come up short again in its quest to get back to the Super Bowl.\n\n“It’s hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled,” Bills coach Sean McDermott said during an emotional postgame news conference after the Broncos advanced to the AFC championship game with a 33-30 victory.\n\nSorry, Buffalo. It wouldn’t be the NFL without some sort of officiating controversy. After the dramatic regular season was spiced by several cases that inflamed debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to come wrapped with such drama.\n\nThe Bills – plus armchair quarterbacks, ex-players, informed analysts, internet influencers and probably others – maintained that Cooks should have been ruled down by contact after hauling in the rainbow throw from Josh Allen that traveled 55 yards in the air. Cooks and McMillian tumbled to the turf and rolled over with the nickel back emerging with the football.\n\nReferee Carl Cheffers explained that Cooks never had possession of the football as he crashed to the turf.\n\n“The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender was awarded the ball,” Cheffers said in the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) pool report.\n\nMaybe so. Yet that hardly addresses the inconsistency that is often at the heart of debate concerning the calls or non-calls by NFL officials.\n\nHow many times have we seen a receiver barely touch the ground with a knee hitting the turf – as Cooks did – and getting credit for the catch?\n\nSure, there’s always a different perspective with freeze-frame video versus real-time eyesight. That’s part of what the officiating experts – in New York and on the field – undoubtedly have to process.\n\nIn any event, for Bills fans, the would-be catch by Cooks is their version of the “Dez Bryant caught it” controversy that dogged the Dallas Cowboys after the receiver’s apparent catch was ruled incomplete in an NFC divisional playoff loss at Green Bay in January 2015.\n\nOf course, McMillian wonders what the fuss is about.\n\n“I don’t really think he had complete control going down,” he said. “We were both fighting for the ball. I just made a play and basically took it out of his hands and came up with it.”\n\nAdding to Buffalo’s consternation were the two pass interference calls against Taron Johnson and Tre’Davious White, for 17 and 30 yards, respectively, that set up Wil Lutz’s chip-shot winning field goal.\n\nBlame the refs? Cheffers’ crew couldn’t be blamed for the DPI calls – Johnson pulled on Courtland Sutton’s arm as Bo Nix’s pass arrived. White hit intended target Marvin Mims, Jr. early – even in a game where it appeared the officials were not necessarily calling it tight.\n\nStill, you may never convince the Bills – stung in last year’s playoff by a questionable spot on an Allen run in crunch time of the AFC title game loss a Kansas City – that McMillian’s interception should have stood.\n\nMcDermott was unable to challenge the ruling for two reasons. All turnovers and scoring plays are automatically reviewed in New York at any point in the game. Besides, it was overtime, when coaches are unable to challenge a play as all replay reviews are initiated in New York.\n\nStill, credit McDermott for his next-best, last-gasp option: He called a timeout and requested a quick chat with Cheffers, who told him the turnover was confirmed in New York.\n\n“It was a rather rapid unfolding of the review, if there was a review, and so I called a timeout to try to slow it down,” McDermott said. “It would seem logical to me and make a lot of sense that the head official would walk over and want to go and take a look at it. Just to make sure that everybody from here who is in the stadium, to there (in New York) are on the same page. That’s too big of a play, in my estimation, too big of a play in a play that decided the game, potentially … to not even slow it down. That’s why I had to call the timeout.”\n\nThe controversy, nonetheless, will live on. Scrutiny on officials will likely intensify during the offseason as the NFL engages in negotiations with the union for officials as the expiration of their labor pact looms.\n\nSean Payton gets it. The Broncos coach had his own moment of officiating controversy in a high-stakes game during his tenure with the New Orleans Saints. A non-call of pass interference near the goal line stung New Orleans during an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams during the 2018 NFC Championship Game at the Superdome.\n\nHad the Broncos not survived on Sunday, Payton might have some sort of flashback – and surely been livid about an apparent missed call in overtime. Early on Buffalo’s final possession, it appeared that a holding call was missed as Allen threw from his end zone. A flag would have resulted in a safety.\n\n“A phenomenal play by ‘J-Mac,’” Payton said of McMillian’s interception. “But it should’ve ended really with a safety, which would’ve been the first in the history of football.”\n\nA playoff game ending on a penalty would have surely ignited some controversy.\n\nHey, there’s always next weekend.\n\nContact Jarrett Bell at jbell@usatoday.com or follow on X: @JarrettBell\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bills vs Broncos interception controversy explained",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots punched their ticket to the AFC Championship on Sunday, January 18, with a hard-fought 28-16 victory over the Houston Texans. In a game defined by a relentless Foxborough snowstorm, Mike Vrabel’s squad overcame a turnover-heavy first half to secure the franchise's first conference title berth since 2019.\n\nThe matchup lived up to its billing as a defensive slugfest. While the Texans’ top-ranked unit made life difficult for Drake Maye, forcing him into four fumbles, the Patriots’ defense proved even more opportunistic. New England feasted on a record-tying four interceptions from C.J. Stroud, including a crucial Marcus Jones pick-six that swung the momentum for good. Despite the sloppy conditions, Maye’s three touchdown passes provided the necessary spark to push the Patriots past a Houston team that had dominated the Wild Card round.\n\nWith the win, the Patriots now look ahead to a high-stakes trip to higher altitudes next Sunday, January 25. Now, a new generation takes the stage as the Patriots aim to rewrite history and claim the all-time postseason wins record for themselves.\n\nHere is more on who the Patriots play next in the 2026 NFL playoffs.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nWith the win, the Patriots move on to the AFC Championship, facing the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos squeaked past the Buffalo Bills and Josh Allen, automatically getting home-field advantage for the AFC Championship Game. Mile High is certainly no easy place to play, and Denver earned the right to host by clinching the No. 1 overall seed. Though Denver suffered a brutal blow when starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury.\n\nThe matchup carries heavy foreshadowing. The last time these two storied franchises met in the AFC Championship was exactly a decade ago in January 2016. That legendary \"Mile High\" battle served as the final postseason chapter of the Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning rivalry — a game the Broncos won 20-18 on their way to a Super Bowl title.\n\nThis time around, with a new quarterback at the helm, New England is searching for revenge.",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills’ season ended on Saturday after a 33-30 loss to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. Meanwhile, the New England Patriots will play their Divisional Round game on Sunday.\n\nThe Bills have one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL, but have not been able to get over the hump with Josh Allen. One of their biggest flaws as a team is that they lack a true No. 1 receiver. That is one of the reasons they failed to win the division over the Patriots.\n\nTheir leading receiver this season was Khalil Shakir, who had 719 yards on 72 receptions. The Bills have failed to replace Stefon Diggs after losing him. However, they can land a star this offseason. ESPN’s Ben Solak predicted they would trade for A.J. Brown.\n\n“A year after general manager Brandon Beane’s emphatic statement that they didn’t need a WR1 went over disastrously, Buffalo will tilt and get aggressive,” Solak wrote on Saturday. “The Bills will trade a first-round pick and then some for Philadelphia’s A.J. Brown, believing he can be the final player to push their offense over the edge.”\n\nBrown’s issues with the Philadelphia Eagles have been well documented. Multiple times this season, he expressed frustration with his role. In the Eagles’ final game, he was seen arguing with Nick Sirianni on the sideline.\n\nBrown made multiple trade requests last season, according to Joseph Santoliquito of SB Nation. General manager Howie Roseman downplayed trade rumors after the Eagles’ season ended, but many teams could call about Brown.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/2Mf6wJm47JSXK22DVoVot4\n\nHis outbursts and frustration have been going on for a few seasons at this point. He is still an elite receiver and could put up monster numbers with Allen in Buffalo. The Bills getting Brown could be a problem for the Patriots.\n\nBrown is a three-time Pro Bowler and three-time Second-Team All-Pro. He has surpassed 1,000 yards every season of his career except one.

Next up, Stefanski will look to fill out his coaching staff. There already have been a few names linked to Atlanta.\n\nThe Falcons are expected to hire Bill Callahan as offensive line coach and retain defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, but what about Atlanta's offensive coordinator position. Zac Robinson is unlikely to return and has already interviewed for three other vacancies.\n\nAccording to a report from NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Stefanski is eyeing Tommy Rees to be the team's new offensive coordinator. Rees served as Cleveland's offensive coordinator in 2025, working closely with Stefanski.\n\nPrior to joining the Browns staff in 2024, Rees was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Alabama in 2023, and held the same role at Notre Dame from 2020-2023.\n\nFrom @NFLGameDay Morning: The #Falcons hired coach Kevin Stefanski as their next head coach, and his staff is already coming together. pic.twitter.com/Q2DvRUGobE\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 18, 2026\n\nStefanski is an experienced play-caller, and most assume he will continue to call plays in Atlanta.

    "description": "Packers fans will be hoping that old friend Davante Adams can help bring the Bears’ season to an end.",
    "fullText": "Green Bay Packers fans saw their team bomb out of the playoffs last Saturday, giving up 25 fourth-quarter points to the Chicago Bears in a brutal 31-27 loss. With that result, the Bears advanced to this weekend’s Divisional Playoffs, where they face a Los Angeles Rams team that is, in the eyes of many NFL analysts, the best team in the NFL.\n\nThe Rams had to scrape and claw their way to a win in their own Wild Card game, however, scoring a late touchdown to defeat the Carolina Panthers 34-31 on the road. That game saw those two teams trade scores throughout the fourth quarter, but it was Matthew Stafford’s connection to Colby Parkinson with 38 seconds left that proved to be the difference.\n\nPackers fans would surely love to see an old friend knock the Bears out of the postseason, however. Davante Adams is the #2 option in the Rams’ passing game behind Puka Nacua, and tonight’s game would be a perfect time for Adams to deliver a classic performance. In 17 career games against the Bears (16 with the Packers and one with the Raiders), Adams has totaled 88 catches for 1,081 yards and ten touchdowns — a very solid full season’s worth of numbers.\n\nAdams’ last game against the Bears while wearing green and gold came in December of 2021. In that contest, he roasted Chicago’s secondary with 10 receptions, 121 yards, and two touchdowns. His only better game against Chicago was in late 2016, when he caught 13 balls for 132 and two scores. All told, Adams had four 100-yard games when playing the Bears. If he can do anything like that again tonight, the Rams should be headed to the NFC Championship.\n\nOf course, that game comes after the AFC’s 2-5 matchup, which puts one of the league’s best defenses in the Houston Texans against the potential MVP, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye. That should be a fun game to watch as a relatively neutral observer before turning into big-time Rams fans for the final game of the weekend.\n\nJoin us in the comments to discuss both games!\n\nGame Time: 3:00 PM Eastern Time (2:00 PM Central)\nTV Channel: ESPN & ABC\nCommentators: Joe Buck, Troy Aikman\nPoint spread: Patriots -3\n\nGame Time: 5:30 PM Central Time\nTV Channel: NBC\nCommentators: Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth\nPoint spread: Rams -3.5",

    "fullText": "That was supremely satisfying. Mike Macdonald loves his rallying cries, whether it’s “12 as one”, “Chasing Edges,” or “E.A.T.”. I’ve got another one for the Seattle Seahawks after that 41-6 dismantling of the San Francisco 49ers in the Division Round – Professional Destruction.\n\nThose two words embody Macdonald’s vision for the team and perfectly encapsulate the way Seattle has been playing for the last two months. ‘The Dark Side” defense has been utterly suffocating opposing offenses while the running game has been on a roll. For weeks I’ve been trying to find different ways to describe the dominance the Seahawks have been showcasing, particularly on the defensive side. The way Ken Walker is running behind this nasty offensive line, the offense also fully deserves the Professional Destruction moniker.\n\nKen Walker III is really damn good…historically good for the Seahawks playoffs actually.\n\n@Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III tied the postseason franchise record with three rushing touchdowns. #GoHawks\n\n— Seahawks PR (@seahawksPR) January 18, 2026\n\nThe offensive line was giving him good creases and Walker was hitting the hole with burst. He also had some fantastic cutbacks and broke tackles on the way. Maybe the most emblematic run of how the Seahawks are playing right now was the one in the fourth quarter where he ran into a crowd and got pushed about five yards farther when the rest of the team got in on the action. The Seahawks are physically imposing their will on the opponents. I would take his stat line of 19 carries for 116 yards and 3 TDs any day.\n\nErnest Jones IV is really damn good. He singlehandedly caused two turnovers today, stripping the ball from Jake Tonges on Seattle’s second defensive drive and picked off Brock Purdy later in the game. He’s a tackling machine and is the leader in the middle of the defense getting everyone lined up. Picking up Jones in a trade last season is one of the best trades John Schneider has made as GM of the Seahawks.\n\nRashid Shaheed is really damn good. Speaking of great trades by John Schneider, the Shaheed trade is the gift that keeps on giving. His opening kickoff return for a TD was literally the game-winner, and was his third return TD since joining the Seahawks at the trade deadline. Shaheed also had a huge run on an end-around and drew a pass interference penalty. With Tory Horton’s injury, adding Shaheed has been a massive key to the Seahawks success this season.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence is really damn good. He got to Brock Purdy on his first throw of the game, nearly forcing a fumble. Later, he blew up a fourth down play. Even later, he strip-sacked Purdy and the ball was recovered by Nick Emmanwori. Tank came to the Seahawks because he thought they had a chance to win the Super Bowl. He’s doing his best to make that a reality.\n\nPlayoff Cooper Kupp is awesome. His stat line of 5 catches for 60 yards might not be the most impressive, but all of them seemed to come at crucial times. Kupp was the reliable safety blanket that everyone hoped he would be after signing with his hometown team.\n\nThe tight ends didn’t have any catches today, but they all blocked their asses off. AJ Barner and Eric Saubert were both throwing key blocks on the outside runs that Walker was so effective with against the 49ers. That kind of selfless play is why those guys are beloved.\n\nIt was good to see Charles Cross and Coby Bryant back out there. Bryant finished the game, unlike Cross, but hopefully it was just precautionary with Charles. Zach Charbonnet was injured as well, but the initial prognosis was somewhat hopeful. He’s a huge part of the third down packages and a touchdown machine, so having him miss time would hurt the offense.\n\nThe offensive line blocked really well again today as evidenced by the 175 yards rushing, the fourth week in a row that Seattle ran for 150+ yards. At this point, I don’t think it’s a fluke. No better time for the run game to come alive than at the most important time of the season!\n\nSeattle will host the NFC Championship game for the first time in over a decade and got damn does it feel good! Whether it’s the third matchup with the Los Angeles Rams or a showdown with the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears, it’s sure to be a wild atmosphere. Until then, enjoy this one folks. This is a special, special team!",

    "fullText": "NFL playoffs overtime rules, explained: How tie games are decided compared to regular season, preseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCan an NFL playoff game end in a tie?\n\nNFL overtime rules for playoff games\n\nNFL overtime rules for regular season\n\nNFL overtime rules for preseason\n\nHistory of NFL playoff overtime rules\n\nPlayoff football tends to be neck-and-neck. Sometimes, it even requires some extra time.\n\nWhile no games in last year's NFL playoffs required overtime, it wasn't too long ago that the Super Bowl went an extra frame, when the Kansas City Chiefs took down the San Francisco 49ers to go back-to-back in February 2024 on a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime.\n\nGiven the nature of the postseason, NFL overtime rules are a bit different in the playoffs vs. the regular season. Most notably, the playoff rules prioritize giving both teams a chance to win, something that changed in recent years.\n\nHere's everything to know about how the 2026 NFL playoff overtime rules work, and how they compare to the regular season and preseason.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about the NFL's virtual measurement system\n\nNo, an NFL playoff game cannot end in a tie. In the preseason and regular season, games can end in ties. However, with the league needing a team to move on to the next round of the playoffs, there is no possibility of a tie in the postseason.\n\nTeams will play more overtime periods until a tie is broken in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: How does NFL MVP voting work?\n\nThe NFL's newest overtime rules for playoff games were implemented in the 2023 postseason. The biggest change was largely in response to the 2022 AFC Championship Game between the Chiefs and Bills, guaranteeing that both teams would get a possession in overtime.\n\nHere's how OT works for playoff games via the NFL rulebook:\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended — the teams will play another overtime period. There can be no ties in the playoffs. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nThe captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend, unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team will have an opportunity to possess the ball in overtime.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nRegardless of whether the team who receives the opening overtime kickoff scores a touchdown, the other team is guaranteed a possession.  However, the game is over if a safety or defensive touchdown is scored.\n\nIf the game is tied after both teams possess the ball once, then the next score wins.\n\nMORE: Explaining how the NCAA OT format works and differences from NFL\n\nIn comparison to the postseason, overtime in the NFL regular season is a bit different, mostly because games can end in ties.\n\nHere are the official regular season overtime rules, via the NFL rulebook:\n\nAt the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nNo more than one 10-minute period will follow a three-minute intermission. Each team must possess, or have the opportunity to possess, the ball, rather than one team being able to win the game by scoring on its first overtime possession. The exception is if the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, then the team that kicked off is the winner.\n\nSudden death play — where the game ends on any score (safety, field goal or touchdown) — continues until a winner is determined after each team has had an opportunity to possess the ball.\n\nThe point after try is not attempted if the game ends on a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of the overtime period, the result of the game will be recorded as a tie.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the NFL's newest kickoff rules\n\nThe most straightforward NFL overtime rules come in the preseason: there is no overtime. With. games not counting for much in the preseason, the league doesn't bother to try and break ties.\n\nThat change was made in 2021, prioritizing player health and safety in games that do not have any bearing on the standings. Players can be evaluated from the first through fourth quarters, and no extra periods are necessary.\n\nMORE: Why does the NFL allow ties in the regular season?\n\nA lot has changed since the first NFL game to go to overtime on Aug. 28, 1955, between the Rams and Giants. That game was played under “sudden death” rules, and the Rams won. From there, the overtime format was fully introduced.\n\nThe NFL moved forward with that model before implementing sudden-death overtime for regular-season games 16 years later. In the original format, the first team to score any points at all won the game. That included kicking a game-winning field goal. “Sudden death” remained the format for 35 years.\n\nIn 2010, the playoff overtime rules were tweaked. For teams that received the ball first, a field goal no longer counted as a game-ender in “sudden death.” Under the change, only a touchdown on the first possession of overtime could win the game in the playoffs. Otherwise, the other team would get a possession.\n\nThat format was added to the preseason and regular season in 2012.\n\nThe length of overtime was altered in 2017, decreasing from a full 15 minutes to just 10 minutes.\n\nIn 2021, overtime was removed from preseason games, with the NFL citing player safety to avoid unnecessary periods.\n\nMost recently, the NFL changed the playoff overtime rules in 2022, assuring both teams would get at least one possession in overtime of a postseason game. Regardless of whether the first team scored a touchdown, the other team was given a shot to tie the game or come back to win it. If the score remained tied after each team had a possession, then “sudden death” began.\n\nMORE: What is considered a catch in the NFL?\n\nHere are the six longest NFL games ever, all of which went deep into overtime. Because regular season games can end in ties, the longest overtime games all consist of playoff games.\n\nAll six of the games below required two overtime periods to decide a winner.\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Dolphins vs. Chiefs)\n\nAFL Championship (Texans vs. Oilers)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Browns vs. Jets)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Ravens vs. Broncos)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Raiders vs. Colts)\n\nNFC Divisional Round (Panthers vs. Rams)\n\nMORE:What is Scorigami in the NFL?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Bills vs. Broncos\n\nAfter their first-round bye and securing the No. 1 seed in the conference, the Denver Broncos will host the No. 6 seed Buffalo Bills and quarterback Josh Allen.\n\nAllen, who willed his team to a wild-card victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, now sets his sights on returning to the game he has struggled to win in previous years. This time, the key difference is the absence of Patrick Mahomes and the three-time AFC champion Chiefs.\n\nThe Broncos, after going 14-3 in the regular season, are the top contenders in the AFC, in large part due to their defense. They will rely on this unit to limit Allen and company, with Mile High making it even more challenging for them to operate their offense.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scores, updates, and highlights as the Broncos host the Bills in the Divisional Round.

The Broncos' defense will need to step up to prevent the Bills from adding to their lead.\n\n6:57 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Allen delivers a dime to his TE to take their first lead since the 1st quarter. The Bills erase a 13-point deficit, and now the pressure falls right back on the Broncos and Nix.\n\nDALTON KINCAID WHAT A CATCH TO TIE IT\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/y4wUrQgjb5\n\n6:56 p.m.: Allen is able to connect with Khalil Shakir for a 46-yard completion. This is now the longest play the Bills have had during this game.\n\n6:45 p.m.: The Buffalo defense is emptying the tank when it comes to pressures on Nix. The Broncos are unable to capitalize on their second Allen turnover of the half and punt the ball right back to the Bills.\n\nPayton elected to attempt to pin the Bills deep rather than extend their lead.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Allen once again gives the ball to the Broncos as he forces a ball into double coverage.

Lutz has been busy and drills another short field goal.\n\nDenver now leads by 13, and Allen will need to show some of that playoff magic if the Bills are to come back against this defensive unit.\n\n6:20 p.m.: History is against the Bills, and the fumble on their opening drive of the second half is not going to help.\n\nThe Bills are 2-13 in the playoffs in franchise history when trailing at halftime.\n\nThey’re down 20-10 in Denver at half after the Broncos scored 10 in the final 30 seconds. pic.twitter.com/y21jeFHLwP\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 17, 2026\n\n6:18 p.m.: Ball security issues continue for the Bills as Allen is sacked and stripped. Three turnovers in five drives for the Bills and two fumbles in three snaps.\n\nThe Broncos are in a prime position to extend the lead they built.\n\n6:06 p.m.: After the Bills scored the game's first touchdown and then got the ball right back, Denver fans may have been nervous. However, Buffalo has two fumbles that the Broncos not only recovered, but scored points off.\n\nThe Broncos could not have had a better end to the first half, scoring 10 points in 22 seconds. Buffalo will start with the ball, and Allen will look to make up for the costly fumble.\n\n6:00 p.m. FIELD GOAL: After a disastrous fumble by Allen with the half winding down, the Broncos took advantage of it and extended their lead.\n\nBroncos ball!\n\nWhat a break before the half 😳\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/317eodiE90\n\nDenver scored 10 points in the final 22 seconds of the first half.\n\n5:58 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Nix looked sharp in the two-minute drill, throwing several strikes and picking up yards with his legs.\n\nRedemption for Lil'Jordan Humphrey!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/2fGMhIkwyb\n\nNix then launched a beautiful 29-yard touchdown to Humphrey to take the lead once again against the Bills. Humphrey dropped a touchdown in the first quarter, but made up for it\n\n5:53 p.m.: The Broncos will be without Pat Bryant after leaving the game with three catches on the game's opening drive.\n\nTroy Franklin is also questionable to return with a hamstring injury. The Broncos will now have to heavily rely on Sutton and Mims, who are already banged up.\n\n5:46 p.m.: Broncos are able to cross midfield with under a minute to go in the half. Nix once again rushed for a first down.\n\nBo scrambling!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/UcPe85ot1F\n\nDenver is driving and looking to score before halftime.\n\n5:36 p.m. FIELD GOAL: The Bills were unable to answer the Broncos' touchdown with one of their own, but they managed to tie the game with a 33-yard field goal made by Matt Prater.\n\n5:34 p.m.: The Bills put together a good drive on a 24-yard pass to Cook, then faced some adversity after a sack made it 2nd and long.\n\nBeautiful route by the veteran Brandin Cooks on third down\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8ysFSIOAtr\n\nHowever, Allen connected with Bradin Cooks for a 15-yard pass to keep the drive alive.\n\n5:25 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Denver makes the most of the Cook fumble and scores on some trickery. Frank Crum, the offensive tackle, caught a touchdown pass from Bo Nix.\n\nFRANK CRUM BIG MAN TD\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8SEiIm527H\n\nThe Broncos take the lead off of some creativity from Sean Payton.\n\n5:17 p.m.: Cook was drilled by Alex Singleton and fumbled the ball. The Broncos recovered it, and now Denver has excellent field position.\n\nBroncos ball! Alex Singleton forces the fumble 😳\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/msSHg9AKXj\n\nThis marks Cook's fourth fumble of the season which is tied for the most among other RBs.\n\nThat fumble was James Cook's fourth of the year, including regular season, most among RBs, and one more than he had in his first three seasons combined, per @ESPNInsights.\n\n— Alaina Getzenberg (@agetzenberg) January 17, 2026\n\n5:15 p.m.: Allen scrambles for a 25-yard run, Buffalo dominating on the ground. They've already picked up 75 yards on only 10 carries.\n\n5:11 p.m.: The Broncos are unable to do anything on their second drive of the game. Courtland Sutton nearly made a diving catch on third down, but it was ruled incomplete.\n\nThe Bills will send Allen and company back onto the field, looking to extend their lead.\n\n5:07 p.m.: At the end of one, both offenses had promising opening drives, but only one was able to capitalize with six. Cook was spectacular on the Bills' first drive, as was Allen.\n\nThe Broncos fumbled on the final play of the opening quarter but recovered. It will be 2 and 10 after the break for Denver\n\n5:04 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: With Cook and Allen dominating Denver with the ground game, Allen only needed to complete four passes.\n\nMecole Hardman playoff TDs are back!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/CWy8FUMSXh\n\nAllen was able to complete a 4-yard pass to Mecole Hardman to put the Bills on top just before the opening quarter is about to end.\n\n4:55 p.m.: Pat Surtain looked shaken up and is heading towards the blue medical tent. The Broncos certainly cannot afford to lose their all-pro corner.\n\n4:54 p.m.: After having a technical issue with his helmet, Allen was forced to call a timeout.

There was always a chance that not every postseason game would be decided in four quarters.\n\nThe divisional round is providing NFL fans with their first look at overtime in the 2025 postseason. The Buffalo Bills forced OT against the Denver Broncos with a late field goal by Matt Prater.\n\nThis marks the sixth overtime playoff game in the last six seasons.\n\nHere's what to know about the overtime rules in the NFL playoffs:\n\nIf the score is tied after regulation, there's another coin toss. Here's what the rules are:\n\nThe overtime period is 15 minutes long.\n\nIt is 10 minutes in the regular season.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts per half (two overtime periods).\n\nEach team will have a possession, but the game does not automatically end if the first team scores a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied after each team gets one possession, the next score wins.\n\nAn exception is made if the team that first possesses the ball commits a safety. The kickoff team wins in this scenario, the same as in the regular season.\n\nExtra points are not attempted if the game ends in a touchdown.\n\nAll replays are initiated by the replay official and not by the coach's challenge.\n\nWild card round: Saturday, Jan. 10 to Monday, Jan. 12, 2026\n\nDivisional round: Saturday, Jan. 17 to Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026\n\nConference championship: Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026\n\nSuper Bowl: Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFL overtime rules: What are OT rules in playoffs?",

O'Neil, who also added the defensive assistant title with the Lions in 2025, has been with Detroit each of the past two seasons.\n\nO'Neil, 47, has worked in the Jets organization before, serving as the Jets' defensive quality control coach in 2009 when New York advanced to the first of what would be back-to-back AFC Championship games.\n\nThe Jets boasted the NFL's No. 1 passing defense (153.7 passing yards per game), total defense (252.3 yards per game), and scoring defense (14.8 points per game) during that 2009 campaign.\n\nWe've completed virtual interviews with the following candidates for our defensive coordinator opening.\n\n— New York Jets (@nyjets) January 16, 2026\n\nIn Detroit, O'Neil has overseen one of the league's best safety tandems.

Meanwhile, Brian Branch earned Pro Bowl honors in 2024 after notching 109 tackles, 16 passes defended, eight tackles for loss, four interceptions and one sack.\n\nThe Lions allowed the second-fewest passing touchdowns (18) and registered the lowest opposition passer rating (82.0) during the 2024 season.\n\nOf course, O'Neil worked under then-Lions defensive coordinator and now-Jets head coach Aaron Glenn during the 2024 season.\n\nFor more Lions coverage,  Follow Josh on X, @JoshOnLions\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lions Wire: Detroit Lions safeties coach interviews with New York Jets for DC job",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are getting a key player back for their divisional-round game against the Denver Broncos and it is none other than defensive tackle Ed Oliver.\n\nOliver suffered a torn biceps injury midway through the season, and while he was expected to not return at all this campaign, he is now on the cusp of doing so.\n\nEarlier in the week, Oliver was designated to return from injured reserve and after turning in three limited practices, he was activated from the list.\n\nWhile he still carries a questionable tag, the expectation is Oliver will play.\n\nNow, it remains to be seen how much Oliver is actually going to play.\n\nThe expectation has been that he won't play a full complement of snaps, which wouldn't be surprising given his lengthy absence.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe, that is exactly what is going to happen.\n\n\"Ed [Oliver] won’t be 100% today and will play limited reps but Buffalo believes 'a rusty Ed is better than most,'\" Wolfe reported.\n\nWe will likely see Oliver play the majority of his snaps, at least, on obvious passing downs, as the star defensive tackle shines as a pass-rusher more than a run defender.\n\nEven though Oliver isn't going to play a full game, the simple fact that he is out there and able to play not only provides a boost to the defense, but to the team's morale, also.\n\nKevin Stefanski rumor is troubling development for Titans, Ravens\n\nRaiders rumor pinpoints possible favorite for head coach job\n\nGiants rumors detail holdup with John Harbaugh's contract\n\nMike McDaniel-Raiders rumor is bad news for Eagles, Lions, Bucs\n\nKevin Stefanski rumor is huge for Falcons, bad for Ravens, Titans\n\nTyreek Hill confuses Chiefs, Falcons fans with social media post",

    "fullText": "Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills aim to knock off the AFC’s top seed Saturday afternoon, facing the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.\n\nThe Broncos are -1.5 betting favorites at the best NFL betting sites.\n\nBelow, we will look at NFL player props for all of the top offensive players for the Bills and Broncos.\n\nOur computer projects big statistical games from James Cook, Khalil Shakir, Courtland Sutton, and Evan Engram.\n\nAllen Under 211.5 passing yards <<-110>>\n\nNix Over 210.5 passing yards <<-114>>\n\nCook Over 73.5 rushing yards <<-114>>\n\nHarvey Under 56.6 rushing yards <<-110>>\n\nShakir Over 49.5 receiving yards <<-110>>\n\nSutton Over 49.5 receiving yards <<-111>>\n\nKincaid Over 35.5 receiving yards <<-108>>\n\nEngram Over 20.5 receiving yards <<-110>>\n\nMake your postseason bets at FanDuel, America's No. 1 sportsbook! \n\nSportsbooks are giving Denver’s pass defense a ton of respect, but I’m not convinced it’s entirely warranted.\n\nThe Broncos looked like world-beaters against the likes of Trey Lance, Chris Oladokun, and Geno Smith, holding all three under 200 passing yards.\n\nWhen facing competent quarterbacks, however, yardage told a different story: Trevor Lawrence threw for 279 yards against Denver on Dec. 21, Jordan Love passed for 276 yards on Dec. 14, and even Marcus Mariota managed 294 yards through the air on Nov. 30.\n\nJosh Allen, a level or two above all of those QBs, showed last week that he can still rack up yardage, completing 28-of-35 passes for 273 yards against Jacksonville.\n\nI’ll start by disagreeing with the computer and take the Allen Over.\n\nCook has had an outstanding season, but this number feels a little too high against an excellent Denver front.\n\nSince Thanksgiving, the Broncos haven’t allowed a single running back to surpass 73.5 rushing yards. I expect Buffalo to focus on beating Denver through the air rather than on the ground, which likely limits Cook’s opportunities.\n\nI’ll disagree with the computer here and take the Under on Cook.\n\nThe Bills’ receiving corps has been decimated by injury, with both Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers tearing ACLs against Jacksonville.\n\nAs a result, all of Buffalo’s wide receivers should see increased targets. We already saw a sign of this last week: Shakir was targeted a season-high 12 times by Allen against the Jaguars, responding with 82 receiving yards.\n\nI’ll ride with the computer and take the Shakir Over.\n\nProjection: 37.1 receiving yards\n\nIn last year’s postseason matchup between the Bills and Broncos, Dalton Kincaid had 47 receiving yards.\n\nAllen’s trust in him has only grown this season, with the tight end averaging 43.5 receiving yards per game since the start of November.\n\nI’m on the side of our AI here. Take the Over.\n\nPredictions for every NFL Divisional Round game\n\nProjection: 218.0 passing yards\n\nA major reason the Broncos were non-competitive in last year’s 31-7 playoff loss to Buffalo was that Sean Payton didn’t trust Nix. The quarterback threw a season-low 22 passes in that game.\n\nFor context, Buffalo allowed Trevor Lawrence to pass for 207 yards last weekend. During the regular season, Denver’s passing output per game (223.9 yards) was nearly identical to Jacksonville’s (222.3).\n\nBecause I believe Payton will let Nix chuck it at least 30 times in this one, I like the Over (slightly). The computer and I agree.\n\nThis number is extremely high for Javonte Harvey, even against Buffalo’s porous run defense. Harvey became Denver’s lead back after Nov. 6, when JK Dobbins went down with an injury.\n\nIn the seven games since, he’s gone Over this number just twice.\n\nMeanwhile, coach Sean Payton has been giving more carries to 5-foot-7 back Jaleel McLaughlin. McLaughlin posted a season-high seven carries on Christmas against Kansas City, then added six carries for 41 yards on Jan. 4 against the Chargers.\n\nI’ll take the Harvey Under here, as will my computer pal.\n\nThe Broncos’ best win in the second half of the regular season came in a 34-26 victory over the Packers at Mile High. In that game, Nix targeted Sutton 10 times, and the receiver finished with 113 yards.\n\nBuffalo’s pass defense is impressive, but it’s not immune to big performances. Last week, Parker Washington racked up 107 yards, Tee Higgins had 92, Jaylen Waddle posted 84, and Stefon Diggs went for a whopping 146 yards against the Bills.\n\nI like Nix to target Sutton a ton, and the number is pretty low. The computer and I like the value on the Over.\n\nProjection: 25.2 receiving yards\n\nThe Bills do a tremendous job against opposing tight ends, allowing just 29.6 yards per game to the position during the regular season. In big games, they’ve been even more dominant.\n\nSince the start of December, Buffalo’s two biggest wins came against New England on Dec. 14 and Jacksonville in last week’s playoff matchup.\n\nThe Bills held Hunter Henry to just one catch for 18 yards against the Patriots and limited Brenton Strange to a season-low nine receiving yards versus the Jaguars.\n\nI’ll agree with the computer and take the Over.\n\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section give their thoughts on the Chargers' playoff exit, the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the, Lakers, Clippers and Chloe Kim.",
    "fullText": "If there’s an important playoff game for the Chargers to win, you can bet they’re going to lose. Such was the case again against New England.\n\nWhile having a decent enough defense, the offense was pathetic. And, yes, I know their offensive line was completely depleted. But, the 49ers were banged up as well. They lost George Kittle and still won.\n\nWell, there’s always “next season.” Unfortunately, those two words still haunt the Chargers and their fans.\n\nOnce again the Chargers flop in the playoffs.\n\nThis time much of the blame should be placed at the top with Jim Harbaugh. Perhaps he did not watch or was not aware of how many times in this year's playoffs teams had failed to convert on fourth down with disastrous consequences. The psychological effect on the team from failing to convert and put points on the board early was evident. He had a team without their top running back and a very weak offensive line yet chose to go for it.\n\nHopefully he will learn from this or maybe it is time for Harbaugh to join his brother in seeking new jobs.\n\nNothing wrong with the Chargers that a new OC with a game plan can't fix. Or is there?\n\nThanks for firing your OC Greg Roman. Loyalty is great but loyalty does not get you to the promised land. In two postseason trips, one touchdown to show for it.\n\nIt needed to be done for Justin Herbert & Co.\n\nThe Yankees won 27 World Series championships by being the best team money can buy. The west coast Yankees, aka the Dodgers, are now the best team money can buy. That's capitalism, baby!\n\nAs a Dodgers fan for a Joe DiMaggio-esque 56 consecutive seasons, I am happy to have Kyle Tucker in the Dodgers' outfield in 2026. Certainly, he will be an improvement over Michael Conforto, and allow Teoscar Hernandez to go back to left field.\n\nHowever, I find it perplexing that a player who appeared in only 78 and 136 games in 2024 and 2025, and who has had only one top 10 MVP finish (fifth in 2023) in his career, would be signed for a whopping average of $60-million annually. To earn that enormous salary over the next four seasons, Tucker should be considered the best player in baseball not named Shohei Ohtani.\n\nNewsflash! The Dodgers buy another superstar, cost be damned! I'm not a Dodgers fan. I'm a Baseball fan, witnessing an organization job a system that destroys parity and fairplay. So go ahead — hop aboard the Dodgers bandwagon for another championship. While baseball fans everywhere else throw up their hands in disgust and flock to the NFL.\n\nThe Dodgers' signing of Kyle Tucker for ridiculous money now ensures a (stoppage) after this baseball season. For everyone saying other teams could do the same thing, really? As much as anyone could love the Dodgers, this just takes away from the game.\n\nIf you’re mad at the Dodgers don't stop there — might as well don a cape and be super mad because MLB has no kryptonite against them.\n\nWe should not expect too much from the Lakers. We have the same offense ran by the Dallas Mavericks for Luka Doncic transplanted to L.A. Give the ball to Luka and everyone else stands around and watch. Who is teaching these guys defense?\n\nHow many more games do fans have to endure before the Lakers hire a coach who is a defensive specialist? Where is Frank Vogel when you need him?\n\nThe only way I see the Lakers or Clippers making it to the second round of the playoffs is if they play each other in the first round.\n\nThe womens' snowboarding competition at next month's Winter Olympics in Milan has taken an interesting twist. American Chloe Kim, two-time Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe, will have to wear a shoulder brace after tearing her labrum. This would be analogous to having one arm tied behind your back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

    "fullText": "The latest edition of the soon-to-be 43-game series between the Denver Broncos and the Buffalo Bills takes place in the 2025-26 NFL Playoffs. And Denver gets their chance to get retribution against the team that knocked them out of the postseason in last year’s Wild Card round.\n\nThe Broncos get the added benefit of coming into this game fresh and hopefully with a concreted and bullet proof game plan while the Bills have a bit of a limp heading into Saturday. Their injury report is extensive. But how much will this help the Broncos out? Let’s take a look at three keys to victory.\n\nAt the end of the regular season the Bills sat 28th in the league in run yards per game given up (136 YPG) and the Jaguars took full advantage of this shortcoming in their Wild Card matchup. Even without including Trevor Lawrence’s 31 yards off of scrambled, Jacksonville put up 123 rushing yards with five rushes of 10+ yards, two of which went for 20+ yards.\n\nThe style of run offense the Jags employed was also very similar to the looks that Denver likes to employ, so hopefully that bodes well for Denver’s chances to copy this success.\n\nIf Denver is able to keep as much pressure off of Bo Nix as possible, then that should lead to increased success throughout the playoffs, and that starts with being able to establish the run. I’d like plenty of Pin and Pull concepts by both RJ Harvey and Nix while keeping the between-the-tackle stuff primarily for Jaleel McLaughlin.\n\nWe all know that Josh Allen is an absolute game-breaker and is near unstoppable when he really gets going. So it’s up to this defense to contain him as much as possible on Saturday.\n\nI think there’s going to be a lot of pressure on the back end of the defense. Luckily the Bills will be down two more wide receivers this week due to injury, so that means that Khalil Shakir will have to bear most of the burden of passing game success. And if you take him out, you eliminate most of Josh Allen’s options. Also, most of Allen’s success in the air this season has come against zone coverage, which Denver usually stays away from. If the defense is able to keep the lid on this offense, force Allen to hit his check downs or hold onto the ball, then things should trend in Denver’s favor.\n\nThey just can’t give up five yards a carry on QB sneaks like Jacksonville did.\n\nSean Payton gave us an interesting note on the relationship between the turnover battle and Buffalo’s chances of winning football games.\n\nHere's Sean Payton on preparing for the Bills. \n\nOne interesting note — said he's charted two years of Buffalo's losses and they've lost the turnover battle in \"all but one of them.\"\n\nTurnover differential, then, continuing to be a key theme for the #Broncos pic.twitter.com/F4UbuKz5md\n\n— Luca Evans (@bylucaevans) January 13, 2026\n\nSo in all but one of Buffalo’s losses over the last couple of years the Bills have lost the turnover battle. Turnovers, however, have been difficult for this defense to manufacture. They did do some great things in this department against the Chargers in Week 18, but those were predominantly backups playing.\n\nOnce again, Denver needs to find a way to steal the ball away from the Bills and keep them off of the field. Interceptions will be hard to come by, so that suggests that fumbles will be the name of the game this week.",

    "fullText": "According to a report from On3’s Steve Wiltfong, Arion Carter has withdrawn his name from the 2026 NFL Draft. The rising senior linebacker will now hit the transfer portal, searching for a home for his final season of college football.\n\nCarter is obviously not expected to return to Tennessee. The Volunteers and new defensive coordinator Jim Knowles have been working overtime in the transfer portal to overhaul the defensive roster. One of those tasks on Knowles’ to-do list was replacing Carter, who declared for the NFL Draft in December.\n\nTennessee has since signed Amare Campbell at linebacker, who will join his old coach in Knoxville after spending last season at Penn State. Jeremiah Telander, Edwin Spillman and Jadon Perlotte round out the group with other young players trying to get in the mix.\n\nCarter comes from Smyrna and was a huge get for Tennessee on the recruiting trail. Josh Heupel was able to beat out Nick Saban and Alabama at the time. A two-year starter in Knoxville, Carter led the team in tackles with 76 this past season, despite missing time with turf toe. He was named All-SEC second team following the 2025 season.\n\nWiltfong’s report names Alabama and Texas A&M as the early schools to watch for Carter, who was a leader for Tennessee. Maybe this is due to a draft evaluation, maybe this is due to his lingering injury that just wouldn’t go away during the second half of the season — either way, the timing just didn’t work for Tennessee to bring him back with Campbell already in place.",

Despite the nice closing words general manager Monti Ossenfort and owner Michael Bidwill stated about the 42-year-old, the three straight losing seasons had many questioning how long it would take Gannon to get another NFL job.\n\nThose rumors were quickly shut when he had an interview with the Dallas Cowboys regarding their defensive coordinator positioning. However, the bigger surprise came on Friday, when ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Gannon is meeting with the Tennessee Titans for their vacant head coaching position.\n\nArizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon addresses the media during a news conference at State Farm Stadium in Glendale on July 24, 2024.\n\nGannon was praised as a great leader and culture setter for Arizona by his players and executives. Despite it not turning into wins, Bidwill is happy with the job Gannon did, just couldn’t stack in wins. The Titans could be trying to bring in Gannon as its own culture setter, like the Cardinals believe he did with them.\n\nThe problem relies on the lack of results Gannon had in his first stint as a head coach. He had two seasons with four or less wins, and even loss to Tennessee this past season in an embarrassing home loss.\n\nJonathan Gannon is introduced as the new head coach of the Arizona Cardinals by team president Michael Bidwill and general manager Monti Ossenfort (right) during a news conference at the Cardinals training facility in Tempe on Feb. 16, 2023.\n\nThe Titans goal could be to try and find a head coach that’ll help develop their franchise quarterback in Cam Ward. Gannon’s losses are hard to excuse, but he did have a stellar relationship with quarterback Kyler Murray during his tenure. Even after Murray’s silent benching, the two-time Pro Bowler posted on his X account about his support and love for Gannon after his departure.\n\nCardinals get interview with Robert Saleh for head coaching job in 2026",

    "description": "Harrison's NFL career took off at the start of Tomlin's Steelers tenure.",
    "fullText": "James Harrison's string of five straight Pro Bowl seasons started when Mike Tomlin took over as the Pittsburgh Steelers' head coach in 2007. The tenacious linebacker won his second Super Bowl ring and only NFL Defensive Player of the Year award under Tomlin.\n\nBut Harrison doesn't believe Tomlin belongs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame after he voluntarily ended his 19-season run leading the Steelers. Harrison said so on Friday's episode of his show \"Deebo & Joe,\" which he co-hosts with former Steelers and Cleveland Browns cornerback Joe Haden.\n\nHaden, a three-time Pro Bowler who played for Tomlin from 2017 to '21, posed the question, \"Is Coach T a Hall of Fame coach, in your opinion?\"\n\nHarrison responded with a two-letter answer: \"No.\"\n\nTaken aback, Haden said, \"OK. So now, yeah, that's actually crazy.\"\n\nThat's when Harrison dove into his explanation:\n\n\"He hasn't made disciples,\" Harrison said. \"You're telling me you're a Hall of Fame coach, but no one has followed you? ... He's the only coach that has coached this long and does not have a tree, bro.\"\n\nDeebo did not hold back. Nineteen years or not, he says Mike Tomlin is not a Hall of Fame coach and points straight at the postseason record and the empty coaching tree.@jharrison9292 @joehaden23 #DeeboAndJoe pic.twitter.com/kUXagXFhz1\n\n— Deebo & Joe (@deeboandjoe) January 16, 2026\n\nHarrison was critical of the fact that during Tomlin's nearly two-decade tenure in Pittsburgh, he didn't have a single assistant transition directly from his staff to a head-coaching position in the league.\n\n\"I'm not going to not give him the Hall of Fame nod because he's bad at hiring offensive coordinators,\" said Haden, who was in clear disagreement with Harrison on the subject.\n\nHarrison didn't back down. In fact, he even speculated that Tomlin steered away from bringing in top-notch coordinators in order to keep the spotlight on himself.\n\n\"Is it enough spotlight to go around?\" Harrison said.\n\n\"You got to realize, a lot of coaches, when they get this head coach thing, it's a lot of ego that go with that. ... Now, a great coach, dude, the measurement of greatness, it's not based on personal experiences and relationship you had with them. It is purely on what you did as a coach. Did you get championships?\"\n\nHaden countered with, \"What about wins and losses?\"\n\nTomlin, after all, piled up 193 regular-season wins, tied with Chuck Noll for the most recorded by a head coach in Steelers history. He was, however, just 8-12 in the playoffs and lost his last seven postseason games.\n\nThat's where Harrison headed with his argument.\n\n\"When you look at the greats, the measurement of greatness for all-time greats, like everybody is saying right now, nobody has a negative postseason record,\" Harrison said.\n\nHaden maintained that Tomlin is a Hall of Fame coach because he delivered a Super Bowl to the Steel City and consistently put Pittsburgh in position to contend. The Steelers won eight AFC North titles and didn't have a single losing season with Tomlin in charge.\n\nJust last month, Harrison was at it again. He played for Tomlin from 2007 to '12 but apparently wasn't all too impressed.\n\n\"As much as I hate to say this, I have never been a person that thought Coach Tomlin was a great coach,\" Harrison said during a Dec. 1 episode of his show, following the Steelers' Week 13 defeat to the Buffalo Bills that came with \"Fire Tomlin\" chants.\n\nHarrison continued at the time: \"I thought he was a good coach. ... A good coach gets you to play to your potential. And right now, the players we have on that team I have seen play, I know they can do it. I have seen them do it.\n\n\"And they're not playing up to their potential. And a great coach gets you to play beyond your potential.\"\n\nThe Steelers bounced back from that loss to the Bills and won the AFC North before their latest one-and-done playoff appearance and Tomlin's subsequent resignation.",

    "fullText": "Jan 16 (Reuters) - A study by AI risk management platform Alethea into the surge in artificial intelligence-generated fake content, dubbed \"AI slop,\" has warned sports teams, leagues and fans of the risks posed by increasingly sophisticated digital misinformation.\n\nRetired NFL player Jason Kelce never said ​2026 Super Bowl halftime singer Bad Bunny's critics were \"a bad fit for America's future\".\n\nSan Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle never ranted about slain ‌conservative activist Charlie Kirk and politics in football.\n\nHowever, thousands of people believed they did and that is the problem.\n\n\"Teams and players are suddenly being accused of things that are completely fabricated,\" Lisa Kaplan, ‌founder and CEO of Alethea, told Reuters on Friday, adding that the evolution of AI tools has made fake news a more daunting challenge.\n\n\"Content now looks real and is produced at a volume that makes it hard for the average person to determine if it's authentic,\" she said.\n\n\"Before, fake news often relied on human labour to repetitively copy and paste content. Today, AI can impersonate brands and create engaging images that mimic genuine announcements.\"\n\nKaplan noted that this wave of AI-generated misinformation has disrupted the traditional monetisation ⁠model of sports media. \"These networks drive engagement to questionable websites, ‌skew advertising metrics, and can even create scenarios that could manipulate betting markets,\" she added.\n\nC Shawn Eib, Alethea's Head of Investigations, described how these networks use tactics such as making multiple disjointed announcements, like the conflicting claims that former Baltimore Ravens coach ‍John Harbaugh had been hired by multiple teams at the same time.\n\n\"When a single figure appears to be linked with several teams at the same time, it quickly becomes clear that an AI system is behind the creation of these images,\" Eib explained.\n\nAI DECEPTION CAN EXPLOIT 'RAGE BAIT'\n\nThe content follows a formula: fake game updates, nonexistent celebrity feuds, manufactured scandals, and politicised ​quotes falsely attributed to star players.\n\nThe fabricated Kelce and Kittle quotes are prime examples. Both NFL stars publicly denied making comments they never said after the ‌posts went viral.\n\n\"If fans, players and even entire franchises fall prey to these manipulated narratives, it risks damaging reputations, undermining trust and even politicising sport,\" Alethea's VP of Communications Kaila Ryan said.\n\n\"Sports organisations need to proactively manage their brands and digital safety. It is crucial for teams and leagues to start monitoring these risks, work together across communications, legal and security teams, and educate fans to verify announcements from official channels,\" she added.\n\nThe business impact extends beyond reputational harm.\n\nThese networks siphon ad revenue from legitimate sports media and distort audience metrics. Some outbound links have been flagged for phishing and malicious redirects, presenting real fraud risk to fans.\n\nThe problem ⁠is not limited to the NFL. Alethea discovered similar operations targeting the NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL, ​NASCAR, Formula 1, IndyCar and professional tennis.\n\nKaplan added that beyond monetisation, sport remains a rare cultural ​touchpoint that unites people, making them attractive targets for influence operations, and she pointed to Russia's alleged exploitation of then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's 2018 'Take a Knee' protest as a precedent.\n\nIn a 2019 report, the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed that Russian trolls had focused heavily ‍on the kneeling debate as part of ⁠a broader effort to stoke racial tensions and divide the U.S. following the 2016 election.\n\n\"Kaepernick's protests were exploited for a purpose that had nothing to do with sport. Instead, it's a way of leveraging a cultural touchstone and turning it into something that polarises people,\" said Kaplan.\n\n\"Teams need to ⁠work in unison to defend their identities and protect their fans from falling victim to fraud or manipulation,\" she added, noting that the best advice for fans is to be vigilant.\n\n\"Verify breaking news ‌through official team channels, don't click links in suspicious page comments and remember that outrage is often the product, not the by-product, ‌of what you're seeing\".",

Wilks was fired after 14 games and Harris, the Jets' defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator, took over the play calling.\n\n“Compatibility is just as important as coachability,” Glenn said last week when asked about what he's looking for in a defensive coordinator. “So, I want to make sure we see things the same way and I want to make sure that we can vibe as far as sitting down and talking about how we see football.”\n\nLeonhard, a former safety who played for the Jets from 2009-11, has some familiarity with Glenn. In Leonhard's final season as a player in 2014 for Cleveland, Glenn served as the Browns' assistant defensive backs coach.\n\nLeonhard began his coaching career as an assistant at Wisconsin, his alma mater, in 2016 before becoming the Badgers' defensive coordinator and later the interim head coach in 2022. After one year at Illinois, Leonhard joined Sean Payton's staff in Denver as the defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator in 2024 before adding assistant head coach to his duties this season.\n\nMartindale was the defensive coordinator at Michigan the last two seasons after a two-year stint in the same role with the Giants. After several college stops to begin his coaching career, Martindale had NFL stints with the Raiders, Broncos and Ravens.\n\nAraujo spent the last four seasons with the Dolphins, first as an assistant defensive backs coach for Mike McDaniel and then as the cornerbacks coach.\n\nBanda coached the Browns’ safeties the last three seasons under Kevin Stefanski after several college stops, including Texas, Mississippi State, Miami and Utah State.\n\nCovington joined the Packers this season as their defensive line coach and run game coordinator after spending eight seasons with the Patriots, including last season as the defensive coordinator.\n\nJones has spent the last five seasons with the Vikings as the defensive backs coach and also served as the pass game coordinator the last three. He has also had NFL coaching stints with the Dolphins and Bengals.\n\nO’Neil has been with the Lions the past two years, including the 2024 season when Glenn was the defensive coordinator in Detroit. He's a defensive assistant who also coaches the Lions' safeties. He was a defensive quality control coach for the Jets in 2009 and their assistant defensive backs coach from 2010-12. O'Neil also has spent time with the Bills, Browns, 49ers and Raiders.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Draft is expected to lack top-tier quarterbacks, which could lead to a flurry of veteran quarterbacks changing teams this offseason. One signal-caller who is expected to draw considerable attention on the trade market is Mac Jones.\n\nJones signed a two-year contract worth $8.4 million with the 49ers this offseason. With Brock Purdy established as San Francisco’s starting quarterback, the 49ers may consider trading Jones.\n\nWith the limited number of quarterbacks in free agency, Jones could potentially bring in a significant amount of draft capital. According to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, it’s likely that Jones could yield a Day 2 and a Day 3 pick in return.\n\n“I’d say a Day 2 pick, and maybe a Day 3 pick swap for Jones,” Breer wrote on Friday. “The Jets’ trade of Sam Darnold to the Panthers might be the best recent comp I could find, and New York got a 2021 sixth-round pick and ’22 second- and fourth-rounders for the quarterback. I’d guess the price would be a little less because Darnold had two years left on his rookie deal, and he was a little younger, too.”\n\nThe Patriots drafted Jones in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft, and he enjoyed success during his rookie season, helping New England reach the playoffs. However, the next two seasons with the Patriots didn’t go as planned, leading to New England trading Jones to the Jacksonville Jaguars in March of 2024.\n\nJones bounced back this season while Purdy was sidelined with an injury. He appeared in 11 games, starting eight of them, and threw for 2,151 yards along with 13 touchdowns.\n\nThere’s a possibility that Jones could return to the AFC East next season, as both the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets are expected to be on the lookout for quarterback help.\n\nWhy TV Analyst Guaranteed Patriots Playoff Win Over Texans",

    "description": "Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady has been a hot name during the latest NFL head coach hiring cycle.",
    "fullText": "The NFL postseason is a busy time for playoff teams, but also for those teams set to reset their organizations after previous shortcomings. For many offensive and defensive coordinators in the playoffs, January is a month filled with stressful game planning but also prepping for potentially life-changing head coaching interviews.\n\nThat’s true of Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady, who is set to interview for three NFL head coach openings on Sunday, less than 24 hours after Buffalo’s game against the Denver Broncos concludes. Per NFL National Insider Ian Rapoport, Brady will “speak” with senior front-office personnel of both the Baltimore Ravens and Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, January 18.\n\nAlbert Breer reported that Brady is also set to interview with the Las Vegas Raiders, for their head coach opening. Brady has been a popular name to eventually take over as an NFL team’s head coach since the end of last season, with four NFL teams requesting permission to interview him this cycle so far. The 36-year-old Florida native has already interviewed with the Miami Dolphins.\n\nFollowing his ascension to Bills OC midway through the 2023 NFL season, Brady found success almost immediately while in charge of directing Buffalo offense — one now led by current NFL MVP quarterback Josh Allen. Despite fielding one of the league’s least fear-inducing wide receiver groups, Brady has continued to get meaningful production out of every jersey number on offense.\n\nBuffalo finished the 2025 season top five in total offense, boasted the NFL’s top yards/game rushing attack and the league-leading rusher in running back James Cook III — who finished with 1,621 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns, and was named Associated Press Second-Team All-Pro.\n\n#Bills OC Joe Brady will have two interviews the day after his team's divisional round game against the #Broncos: The plan is for him to speak with the #Ravens and #Falcons on Sunday.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 16, 2026\n\nThe Raiders interviewing Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady and 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak for their HC job on Sunday, per sources. Vegas is interviewing the Rams' assistants today, as they get closer to the end of their first round.\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) January 16, 2026",

    "description": "There are some familiar names playing in the NFL playoffs this weekend",
    "fullText": "Last week, Las Vegas Raiders general manager Jon Spytek noted that there were plenty of former players still playing. Now , as the playoffs move onto the divisional round, let’s look at the former Raiders still playing, presented in alphabetical order:\n\nDefensive tackle Andrew Billings.\n\nBillings is a Bears’ backup who started 14 games for the Raiders in 2022. He signed with Chicago as a free agent in 2023.\n\nThe backup played for the Raiders in 2o22 and signed with the Broncos in 2023.\n\nDefensive end Denico Autry, Tackle Trent Brown, tight end Harrison Bryant.\n\nAutry is a backup. He played for the Raiders from 2014-17 after being undrafted. Brown started seven games this season. He was a high-dollar free-agent signing for the Raiders in 2019. His tenure there didn’t go well. Bryant is a deep backup. He spent 2024 with the Raiders as a free agent. He signed with the Eagles in March and then was traded to Houston.\n\nWide receiver Davante Adams, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nAdams is a major part of the Rams’ offense and is playing well in his first season there. Adams had an infamous entire for the Raiders from 2022-24 when the team traded for him and then shipped him out less than three years late. In the end, his time in Las Vegas isn’t looked upon fondly by many. Garoppolo spent one rocky season with the Raiders, in 2023.\n\nTight end Austin Hooper, tackle Thayer Munford, linebackers K’Lavon Chaisson and Robert Spillane.\n\nHooper is a backup. He was a backup for the Raiders in 2023. Munford was a seventh0rround pick by the Raiders and he played there from 2022-24. He signed with the Patriots this season, reuniting with former Raiders’ head coach Josh McDaniels, who is the Patriots’ offensive coordinator this year after being released. Chaisson played 15 games with the Raiders last season and he signed with New England this offseason. He has been a key contributor. Spillane, who the Raiders’ signed in free agency in 2023, signed in free agency with the Patriots in 2025. He is a big part of the New England defense. He is under contract for two more seasons.\n\nHe was the No. 4 overall draft pick by the Raiders in 2019. He had an underwhelming tenure there from 2019-2o22. He is a deep backup for the 49ers.\n\nHe never made the Raiders’ roster as an undrafted free agent in 2023. After a strong preseason, the Seahawks claimed him off waivers and he has become a lynchpin of the the Seattle defense this season.",

    "description": "Jason Logan breaks down his favorite underdog bets of the NFL Divisional Round, including the Denver Broncos.",
    "fullText": "The start of the NFL playoffs saw underdogs bark loudly, with point spread pups finishing 4-2 ATS.\n\nWhat does that mean for this weekend?\n\nOverall, Divisional Round dogs are 21-18-1 ATS going back to the 2015-16 season, but that’s after underdog NFL picks put forth a 4-0 ATS windfall last January.\n\nThe second round of the tournament has traditionally been tougher sledding for teams getting the points — whether you’re getting a single tally or more than a touchdown.\n\nHere are my NFL Underdogs picks and predictions for the Divisional Round.\n\nLast week: 1-1 ATS\nSeason: 32-22-2 ATS (+6.56 units)\n\nBest bet: Denver Broncos +1.5\n(-120 at FanDuel)\n\nThis was one of my first bets of the Divisional Round. Who wouldn’t like a rested No. 1 seed hosting a badly bruised opponent on a short week?\n\nThere are tables in the parking lot of Highmark Stadium in better shape than the Buffalo Bills, as they head up the mountain to face the Denver Broncos on Saturday. Buffalo is down to four healthy WRs, the defense just lost its veteran safety, and QB Josh Allen took a “Hell in a Cell” like beating in the win at Jacksonville.\n\nDenver is an elite defense with two weeks to scheme for Allen & Co. The Broncos’ rushing defense has been iffy toward the end of the year, but given the missing pieces in the Bills' passing game, Vance Joseph can sell out on stopping RB James Cook and force Allen to throw into the teeth of this stop unit.\n\nBuffalo was able to overcome the run being nullified by the Jaguars in the Wild Card Round, with Allen methodically picking apart the Jacksonville zone coverage. However, the Denver secondary is stingier, and its man-centric schemes match up well against a depleted Bills receiving corps.\n\nAllen, overall, has struggled against man coverage. He’s tops in the NFL in many metrics versus zone, but sees his output tempered in terms of completion percentage, passer rating, and catchable ball rate against zone schemes.\n\nBest bet: Chicago Bears +4\n(-114 at BetRivers)\n\nThis spread has slimmed from Los Angeles Rams -4.5 as low as -3.5, with Matthew Stafford’s injured throwing hand fueling that initial adjustment. But you can still find the Chicago Bears +4 on the board, which is a spread that holds more value than you think.\n\nFour has become an under-the-radar key number in NFL betting in recent years, especially since the league moved the PAT further back. From a handicapping standpoint, the 4-point spread has become a “Bermuda Triangle” of betting: favorites win but don’t cover.\n\nGoing back to 2015, when the PAT was moved from the two to the 15-yard line, 4-point favorites win outright 58% of the time but cover in just 45% of those games. In the 29 seasons prior, 4-point chalk won 69% of their games and covered the spread at a 56% rate.\n\nSince 2020, that ATS clip has sunk to 42% despite the win rate remaining unchanged, and closing 4-point favorites are 3-5 SU and 2-6 ATS this season (FYI: Faves between -4 and -4.5 are 4-15 ATS in 2025-26).\n\nNow, I’m not betting the Bears solely on them being 4-point underdogs.\n\nChicago’s explosive passing attack can expose this L.A. secondary, that’s struggled in the home stretch and just made Bryce Young look like Steve Young in the Wild Card Round (for the second time this season).\n\nAnd there’s the matter of the Rams traveling for a second straight week and coming into a cold climate, with extended forecasts calling for bitter temperatures (some models show -7) and potentially 20-plus mph winds at Soldier Field.\n\nIf you like the Rams, you may want to avoid the point spread altogether and choose a moneyline ranging around -200. For the sake of this column, I'll grab Chicago +4 Sunday night.\n\nMy NFL Underdogs column is 32-22-2 ATS this season for ++6.56 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "New Orleans Saints kicker Charlie Smyth says he does not believe he has \"made it\" despite becoming an NFL starter this season.\n\nThe 24-year-old, from Mayobridge in Northern Ireland, made his regular season debut against the Miami Dolphins in November and was the Saints' kicker for the final six games of their campaign.\n\nHe made 12 of 16 field goals, with a long of 57 yards, for the side who missed the play-offs with a 6-11 record in the NFC South, while also adding all 13 extra points he attempted.\n\nThe former Gaelic footballer authored some memorable moments along the way, most notably when kicking the game-winner with six seconds remaining against the Carolina Panthers and later tying a franchise record with five field goals against the New York Jets.\n\nHaving originally joined the Saints' practice squad in 2024 as part of the NFL's international player pathway programme, he was elevated to the 53-man roster for the first time last month and rewarded with a new three-year contract.\n\nEven in an NFL season that featured 44-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers coming out of retirement five years after his last appearance, Smyth securing a starting role less than two years after his first game in the sport ranks as one of the most unlikely stories of the campaign.\n\nRather than embrace his newfound fame at the end of his rookie season, Smyth has already switched focus to ensuring he can have a long career in the sport.\n\n\"You come home and people nearly see you as someone different. People at home are bigging you up, but I'm not thinking I've made it, I haven't,\" he told the GAA Social, the BBC's Gaelic games podcast.\n\n\"I don't feel like people at home really understand the standards. If I want to keep my job, if I want to be an NFL kicker for as long as my right leg allows me to be, there's a standard where you need to be 85 to 90%, or really good in moments.\n\n\"I think I went 12 for 16 on the stats. That's not going to cut it long term.\"",

What does the league have for an encore?\n\nEvery team still in the hunt for the Lombardi Trophy plays in the divisional round, with the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks joining the fray after opening the playoffs with a bye. The Broncos will face a steep challenge as they host Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills, while the Seahawks will see the division-rival San Francisco 49ers for the second consecutive week.\n\nOn Sunday, the Houston Texans and their stellar defense will try to end the New England Patriots' dream season, while the Chicago Bears are hoping a massive comeback isn't necessary to survive the Los Angeles Rams at Soldier Field.\n\nFour networks will broadcast the action on divisional weekend, setting the stage for the AFC and NFC championship games.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the NFL's divisional round announcers as the road to Super Bowl 60 continues.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nJim Nantz and Tony Romo will call their second consecutive Bills game, with Allen and Buffalo heading on the road to Denver to face the top-seeded Broncos.\n\nNantz has long been the voice of the NFL on CBS, as he is wrapping up his 22nd season as the network's top play-by-play broadcaster for the league. Nantz also serves as the voice of the Masters on CBS each April and was the voice of college basketball's Final Four before retiring in 2023. Romo is in his ninth season as CBS' lead NFL color analyst alongside Nantz.\n\nKevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady will return for another 49ers broadcast on Saturday, after calling their win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round. This time, San Francisco is looking to knock off its NFC West-rival Seahawks.\n\nBurkhardt has headed Fox's lead NFL broadcasting crew since Joe Buck's departure for ESPN in 2022. Now in his fourth season in the top slot, Burkhardt called has already called two Super Bowls and is no stranger to big games. He will be joined by legendary quarterback Tom Brady, who has settled into his role as a color analyst nicely in his second season.\n\nAfter calling the Texans' wild-card win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Joe Buck and Troy Aikman will see Houston's vaunted defense try to knock Drake Maye and the Patriots out of the playoffs.\n\nBuck and Aikman have been paired together since 2022, but they left Fox for ESPN in 2022 and are in their fourth season as the voices of \"Monday Night Football.\" Buck was formerly the voice of the World Series at Fox, but he has focused on football since jumping to ESPN.\n\nESPN and ABC will air a divisional round game for the third consecutive season as Buck and Aikman look forward to their first Super Bowl broadcast since the move from Fox next season.\n\nMike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth called a bit of a quiet game in the wild-card round as the Patriots held the Los Angeles Chargers to three points, but there could be fireworks as the Bears host the Rams. Chicago is the king of the comeback this season, but L.A. is favored on the road.\n\nTirico has been the voice of \"Sunday Night Football\" on NBC since 2022, when he replaced Al Michaels on a full-time basis, while Collinsworth has been the network's lead color analyst since 2009.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNFL referees have been under fire throughout the 2025–26 season. It has often felt as though officials were deciding games, leaving fans around the league calling for reform this offseason.\n\nWhile a controversial call in the regular season can go viral, a missed or questionable call in the playoffs can result in a team being eliminated from contention. The importance of accuracy grows with each round, and the NFL strives to assign its best officiating crews to the biggest matchups.\n\nWith four games on the Divisional Round schedule, four different officiating crews have been assigned. None of those crews worked a game during the Wild Card round last weekend.\n\nHere is more on the referees for the 2026 NFL Divisional Round games.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\n10-12 yards deep in the offensive backfield.

The Umpire is focused on the interior linemen, watching for offensive holding and illegal blocks at the line of scrimmage, in addition to checking player equipment and counting offensive players.\n\nThe Sideline & Clock Monitors: The Down Judge and Line Judge patrol opposite sidelines, ensuring players are not offsides or encroaching and ruling on forward progress. The Down Judge also directs the chain crew. Deeper in the secondary, the Field Judge and Side Judge are positioned 20 yards off the line. They mirror each other, watching the widest receivers for pass interference and illegal contact, and marking plays that go out of bounds. The Field Judge is responsible for the 25-second play clock, while the Side Judge serves as the backup game clock operator.\n\nThe Deep Central Monitor: The Back Judge stands the deepest, typically focusing on the area between the safeties. Their central responsibilities include tracking the 40/25-second play clock, ruling on the validity of catches in the deep middle, and watching for action around the end zone and goalposts.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRunning backs have a short shelf life in the NFL, and for players who are bell cows, that is even more so, yet Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry continues to buck that trend.\n\nNormally, we see production start to decline once players reach their late 20s, but in Henry's case, he's still the All-Pro we've known for years.\n\nIn 2025, despite the Ravens' struggles, Henry still posted 1,595 yards and 16 touchdowns at the ripe age of 31. That's ridiculous.\n\nAnd for Maurice Jones-Drew, in his top 64 starting running backs piece for NFL.com, Henry came in at No. 6.\n\n“Other than some early-season fumbling issues, Henry had one hell of a season at 31 years old,” Jones-Drew wrote. “The ageless wonder continued to trounce defenses and finished the season with an absolute bang, rushing for 570 yards and six touchdowns on 85 carries over the final four games.\n\n\"That's 6.7 per clip. Normally, the football world starts to wonder when 31-year-old running backs will consider hanging 'em up. Henry feels far from it.”\n\nMore:Ravens make $74.5 million contract stance clear with Lamar Jackson\n\nMost 31-year-old running backs just want to be productive for their teams.\n\nBut in Henry's case, he's dominating.\n\nIn his last seven NFL seasons, Henry has surpassed 1,500 rushing yards five times and has had 16 rushing TDs four times. Let that sink in.\n\nPlus, he's played every regular-season game in the last three years. That speaks to his longevity in the game.\n\nSome thought Henry was declining when he joined Baltimore in 2024 after a 1,167-yard, 12-TD season in 2023, but he's shown that, at least right now, Father Time is going to have to wait.\n\n2 huge roster decisions could define new Ravens HC\n\nSteve Bisciotti didn't want 'jerk move' to happen to Ravens ex John Harbaugh\n\nWhy Ravens owner was right to fire John Harbaugh\n\nRavens owner makes outstanding Lamar Jackson contract stance",

    "fullText": "Bruised and battle-hardened, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills face Denver on Saturday as their star quarterback seeks to reach his first Super Bowl and add the NFL's biggest prize to his list of accolades.\n\nThe league's reigning Most Valuable Player suffered a head blow, a sprained knee and a hand injury in last weekend's hard-fought clash with Jacksonville, but almost single-handedly dragged his team over the line.\n\nNow, Allen has been cleared fit to play against the Broncos -- the AFC's top seed -- in their highly anticipated divisional round game, knowing victory would leave them just one win away from next month's NFL championship decider.\n\n\"I feel good. Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks,\" Allen, who has also been managing a long-term foot injury, told a press conference.\n\nAllen's run of 122 consecutive starts is the longest streak among active quarterbacks and has led to his teammates and fans jokingly referring to him as \"Superman.\"\n\nBut the quarterback, who hails from the agricultural Central Valley of California, told reporters his toughness came from being a \"country boy\" from \"out in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that the defensive line he will be facing is notoriously robust.\n\n\"They've got some absolute studs over there. Obviously they rush the passer extremely well,\" said Allen.\n\n\"Interior, again, some big stout guys that can really push the pocket.\"\n\nFor Denver, the match-up comes after a bye week, and offers another chance to prove that one of this season's surprise packages can be the real deal at the business end of the campaign.\n\nDespite finishing top of the AFC with the league's joint best record (14-3), the Broncos figure only fifth on the betting market's predicted Super Bowl winners.\n\nStar cornerback Pat Surtain said the team would be relying on a raucous crowd to spur them on for the Broncos' first postseason home game since 2015.\n\n\"I know the atmosphere is going to be crazy, the stadium is going to be rocking,\" Surtain said.\n\n\"I can already feel the magnitude of it,\" he added.\n\nIt is also a chance for the Broncos to avenge last year's devastating 31-7 playoff loss in Buffalo.\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, the injury-ravaged San Francisco 49ers will attempt the next step in their bid to reach a home-field Super Bowl by taking on the high-flying Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe clash pits the two divisional rivals against each other for the second time in three weeks.\n\nAs top seeds in the NFC, the Seahawks also had a bye last weekend. By contrast the 49ers -- who have been decimated by a deepening injury crisis for much of the season -- suffered yet another cruel blow against Philadelphia, when tight end George Kittle tore his Achilles tendon.\n\n\"We've kind of been in a hole for about seven months and once you get to the playoffs, it really doesn't matter,\" said 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, of the non-stop schedule.\n\n\"Everyone's into it. So, whether they gave us three days, one day, eight days... whenever you get dealt your hand, you're ready to roll.\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl will be held at the 49ers' home stadium, in Santa Clara, California, on February 8.\n\nIn Sunday's remaining divisional round games, the New England Patriots will host the Houston Texans, and the Los Angeles Rams travel to the Chicago Bears.",

No Nick Bosa? Brandon Aiyuk MIA? No problem for Bang Bang Niner Gang.\n\nThis is just Sam Darnold’s second career playoff start, and we all know how the first one went. The Seahawks being favored by a full touchdown screams impending letdown.\n\nI’m betting on the underdogs to pull off another miracle.\n\nConcussions to both Texans WR1 Nico Collins and Patriots CB1 Christian Gonzalez essentially cancel each other out, but the combination of New England’s cold-weather advantage and stingy defense will force another poor outing from C.J.

    "fullText": "Fans of Seattle sports often feel their teams are constantly overlooked, or even outright ignored. They feel this way because it's quite literally true. It's an unfortunate blend of \"East Coast bias\" and \"I think people actually just forget the Pacific Northwest even exists.\" I wouldn't be shocked if a sizable portion of folks living east of the Mississippi still think we live like Lewis and Clark up here.\n\nThis is the case for the Seattle Seahawks. A team that won 14 games, has the best defense in football, has the best receiver in football, and earned the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. Yet for most of the country, people still had a \"wow, where did this team come from?\" mentality, only realizing the Seahawks were having a special season when they could no longer ignore them. Even still, this Seahawks squad is largely a mystery for those outside of the PNW, or NFC West.\n\nOne person who has not ignored Seattle all year long has been Good Morning Football co-host Kyle Brandt. On Thursday, Brandt took to the streets of New York City with one simple mission: find as many people as he could who could accurately identify an image of Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald.\n\nThe results were... exactly how you assume they went, and can be seen in the tweet below.\n\nThe Seahawks won 14 games and the 1 seed. \n\nCan NFL fans name Seattle’s head coach? pic.twitter.com/2UDqjVaqiW\n\n— Kyle Brandt (@KyleBrandt) January 15, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald not recognized... literally",

    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts finished the 2025 NFL season with one of the best offensive line units in the game, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nPFF compiled its final rankings of the season, and coming in at No. 2 were the Colts. The Denver Broncos were the only team ahead of Indianapolis.\n\nAccording to PFF's data, Quenton Nelson was the fourth-ranked guard in football. Tanor Bortolini was one of the NFL's \"top breakout players\" by PFF's grading system.\n\n\"Indianapolis replaced center Ryan Kelly and guard Will Fries with Tanor Bortolini and Matt Goncalves, respectively, and both played at a very high level in 2025,\" wrote PFF's Zoltan Buday.\n\nWithout question, through the first half of the season, the Colts' offensive line unit was operating at a high level. However, with the eye test, I don't know that this was the second-best unit down the stretch.\n\nFrom Week 12 on, Jonathan Taylor didn't eclipse the 100-yard rushing mark. He had only one game during that span where he averaged at least 4.0 yards per carry.\n\nGM Chris Ballard even mentioned during his end-of-season press conference that the offense has to \"be able to run it, when we want to run it.\"\n\nIn pass protection, the Colts were steadier, ranking tied for ninth in pass-blocking efficiency throughout the season. In terms of pure pressure rate, the Colts ranked ninth as well.\n\nThe only free agent among the Colts' starting five from last season is right tackle Braden Smith -- although rookie Jalen Travis held his own at right tackle.\n\nThe Colts likely go into the offseason with their starting five already on the roster, but Ballard must improve the overall depth and competition up front.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: How did Indianapolis Colts' offensive unit compare to rest of the NFL?",

    "description": "Of the NFL's 32 franchises, 28 have reached the Super Bowl. Now meet the four teams still trying to get there.",
    "fullText": "The pinnacle of Roman numerals.\n\nWe’re talking about the Super Bowl, of course.\n\nOf the NFL’s 32 teams, 28 have reached the big game that spawns big theatrics. Quarterback Joe Namath predicted his New York Jets would upset the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 3, then delivered with a 16-7 victory. The New England Patriots rallied past the Atlanta Falcons despite trailing 28-3 in Super Bowl 51. And at the halftime show at Super Bowl 38, Janet Jackson experienced her infamous wardrobe malfunction.\n\nFour NFL teams have failed to play in the big game, much less win it. That sad fact may change when the 60th Super Bowl is played Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, at Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nSo without further adieu, let’s meet those sad-faced teams.\n\nThe Browns have suffered heartache, none so intense as in 1986, 1987 and 1989 – their three appearances in the AFC championship game. They lost all three to the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe most painful one involved \"The Drive.\" Broncos quarterback John Elway drove Denver 98 yards on 15 plays and, with 37 second left in regulation, the Broncos tied the game at 20-20.\n\nThe Browns lost in overtime, 23-20.\n\nIn 1995, Cleveland turned its collective fury on Browns owner Art Modell when he announced he was moving the team to Baltimore. When the NFL awarded Cleveland an expansion franchise in 1999, some fans thought with Modell gone, the Super Bowl drought might finally end.\n\nSince then, the Browns have won only one playoff game.\n\nNothing captures the Browns’ version of dysfunction more than the team having had 42 starting quarterbacks since 1999. That includes Deshaun Watson, who the Browns acquired in 2022 through a blockbuster trade that turned out to be a blockheaded trade.\n\nWatson will go down in Browns infamy, a crowded room reserved for the likes of Johnny Manziel and Tim Couch.\n\nBut can Shedeur Sanders, the Browns' 42nd starting quarterback since 1999, lead the Browns to the Promised Land?\n\nThe Lions know abject losing, cruelty and squandered opportunity.\n\nCase in point: During the Hall of Fame career of Barry Sanders, the Lions won a single playoff game.\n\nIn 2023, the Lions reached the NFC championship game for only the second time in franchise history and at halftime led the San Francisco 49ers 24-7. Did we mention squandered opportunity?\n\nThe Lions lost the game, 34-31.\n\nLast year, the Lions entered the playoffs widely regarded as a favorite to win the Super Bowl. And they were 9.5-point favorites against the Washington Commanders in their playoff opener in Detroit.\n\nThen history reared its ugly head, and the Lions suffered a stunning 45-31 loss.\n\nThe team’s all-time playoff record is 9-15, which did not need to be updated this season after the Lions failed to make the postseason.\n\nThe Texans have not suffered the same shame and misery as have the Browns and Lions. After all, the Texans didn’t have their inaugural season until 2002, meaning they’ve only been eligible for 25 Super Bowls, counting the one being played this year.\n\nHouston is two victories away from reaching the big game. It would require the Texans to beat the New England Patriots in a divisional playoff matchup and then prevail in the AFC championship game against the winner of the divisional matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Texans have never played in the AFC championship game; the team has won only wild card games.\n\nThe team’s all-time playoff record is 7-8 − 7-2 in wild card games and 0-6 in divisional games.\n\nLike the Texans, the Jaguars deserve some grace. The team did not make its NFL debut until 1995. Remarkably, the Jaguars reached the AFC championship game in only their second season before losing to the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Jaguars have reached the AFC championship game twice more, losing to the Tennessee Titans 33-14 in January 2000 and squaring off against the Patriots again in January 2018.\n\nThe Jaguars led the Patriots 20-10 early in the fourth quarter on the road before Tom Brady rallied the Patriots to a 24-20 victory.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Which NFL teams have never played in the Super Bowl?

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor most NFL teams, having your rookie class contribute in some way, shape, or form in Year 1 is a big bonus, and for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, most of their 2025 draft class did just that.\n\nNot only was it first-round pick Emeka Egbuka, but others in Benjamin Morrison, Jacob Parrish, and Tez Johnson all had their moments in 2025. So too, Elijah Roberts and Elijah Simmons.\n\nAs such, most can be expected to play key roles for Todd Bowles' team in 2026.\n\nThat is exactly what the franchise would have hoped for.\n\nBut how does the Buccaneers' draft class stack up against the rest of the NFL?\n\nESPN ranked all 32 teams' draft classes based on production, and the Buccaneers' came in at No. 16.\n\nMore:2 OC candidates perfect for Buccaneers and Baker Mayfield\n\nEgbuka started the season on fire, but faded towards the end of the season due to the many weapons at Baker Mayfield's disposal.\n\nMuch more is expected from him in Year 2. And the same can be said for defensive duo Parrish and Morrison. A second offseason to learn under Bowles will be invaluable.\n\nHe stepped up well when the Buccaneers' receiver room was depleted, and became a genuine weapon, so that will bode well entering his second season.\n\nIf all four improve even just by five percent, the Buccaneers will be in good shape entering the 2026 season.\n\nBuccaneers get what they deserve after Week 18 disaster\n\nWhy Buccaneers might have an Emeka Egbuka problem\n\nBuccaneers face huge contract decision with Super Bowl champion\n\nStunning stat shows why Baker Mayfield is biggest loser of Bucs coaching change",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman spoke with reporters Wednesday for the first time since the Irish were left out of the College Football Playoff.\n\nHe touched on multiple topics, including addressing some big additions through the transfer portal. Here are six things Freeman said:\n\nThe “Here Come the Irish” docuseries on Peacock recently showed the moment the Irish coaches and players found out that Alabama and Miami made the CFP over them.\n\nFreeman stared at the video screen with his mouth open. Players put their faces in their hands.\n\nFreeman said Wednesday that he thought the series properly captured the disappointment and confusion they felt. A month later, he said there’s still disappointment for the Irish, who had been ranked No. 9 or 10 up until the selection show. Miami, which will play Indiana in the national championship Monday, received the last spot in the 12-team CFP.\n\n“But you have to move forward, and that’s what we’ve done as a program,” Freeman said. “That’s what I’ve done as a leader. As I reminded the group in our team meeting on Sunday, it’s our responsibility to make sure we leave no doubt. We can’t blame it on somebody else. Although I may be confused about some of the criteria and the committee’s rankings and all those different things, it’s our job as we move forward to make sure we leave no doubt.”\n\nFreeman said he hasn’t second-guessed his team’s decision to skip a bowl game after being left out of the CFP. He said he was proud of how the captains made the decision and didn’t believe it was an emotional one.\n\nHe asked them again and again if they were sure about the decision.\n\n“Because I didn’t want them to regret it,” Freeman said. “And they were convicted in their decision, and I fully support them.”\n\nFreeman’s name has popped up a few times in this NFL hiring cycle. But he announced he was staying at Notre Dame on Dec. 29, when he posted on social media: “2026…run it back”\n\nFreeman noted that he always tells his players that the future is uncertain.\n\n“But everything I want and everything that I need personally can be achieved right here as a head coach of this program,” he said. “And so I hope this is something we have to address every year. I really do because it means we’re having a lot of success right here at Notre Dame.”\n\nFreeman said he has used discussions with NFL teams to gather information and learn how he can be a better coach. He said he didn’t know if an NFL job would interest him at some point in the future.\n\n“I don’t know enough about it,” he said.” Maybe sometime in the future, if it’s the right time and it’s what I think is right for me, then maybe I’ll pursue it. But I don’t love wasting time thinking about things that aren’t right in front of me, and so I don’t know what I will want in however much length of time from now. I know right now that I am as convicted and motivated to be the best head coach of the Notre Dame football program as I can be.”\n\nLast month, Notre Dame and USC put their 96-game rivalry series on pause because they couldn’t agree to the timing of the 2026 game. The Irish then scheduled BYU for a home-and-home series instead.\n\nFreeman said he believes the rivalry is “important for college football” and the athletic department leaders will work to get it back at some point. But he said the proposed timing wasn’t best for Notre Dame and its 2026 CFP pursuit.\n\n“I’m a competitive individual, right?” Freeman said. “And I want to go play anytime, anywhere, but at the same token, it’s important that I make decisions too that are best for the program. And to move a game that we were pretty sure was going to be Week 12 to Week 0 isn’t what’s best for our program. And they had to make decisions that were best for their program. I don’t blame them. They had to make decisions. We had to make decisions.”\n\nFreeman believes his family’s name was “dragged through the mud unnecessarily” over a recent interaction at a high school wrestling tournament.\n\nAn assistant high school wrestling coach, identified by the South Bend Tribune as Chris Fleeger, accused Freeman of battery at the event, saying Freeman pushed him with two hands. But the St. Joseph County prosecutor’s office said it determined through video evidence and interviews that no criminal battery occurred, and Freeman won’t be charged.\n\n“I was confident in this outcome because I know I did not intentionally touch anyone in a rude, angry or disrespectful way,” Freeman said. “I’m glad this matter has been thoroughly reviewed and resolved.”\n\nFreeman took issue of the initial reporting of the incident by the South Bend Tribune before all of the evidence was released.\n\nNotre Dame said in a statement Sunday that the wrestling coach verbally accosted Freeman’s son, Vinny, a senior who signed to wrestle at Cornell, and Freeman and his wife tried to remove their son from the situation.\n\n“I know I’m a public figure, and I understand the scrutiny that comes with that,” Freeman said. “That scrutiny should not extend to my children or any other child of a public figure.”\n\nThe Irish recently announced the additions of former Ohio State wide receivers Quincy Porter and Mylan Graham.\n\nPorter was the nation’s fifth-ranked wide receiver and the No. 1 player from New Jersey in the 2025 class. He had four catches for 59 yards in four games as an Ohio State freshman after missing some time with an injury.\n\nGraham, who was a five-star prospect and the nation’s fifth-ranked receiver in 2024, had six catches for 93 yards in 2025.\n\n“We knew a lot about them in the high school recruiting process, who they were, the type of players they are,” Freeman said. “And I’m glad we were able to get them.”\n\nNotre Dame also landed in the portal former Alabama edge rusher Keon Keeley, who was a five-star recruit ranked No. 2 in the 247Sports composite rankings in 2023. Keeley originally had committed to Notre Dame out of high school before flipping to Alabama.\n\nFreeman called it “a little delayed gratification.”\n\n“I’ve always believed Keon was a Notre Dame kid coming from his high school,” he said. “He’s such a unique individual. He’s a very talented football player. … When he came on his visit, I’m like, ‘Yep, it’s the same Keon we recruited a couple years ago.’ And he fits here, and I’m excited for his future.”\n\nFreeman said linebacker Drayk Bowen had surgery on the labrum in his hip, but he expects him to return in some capacity this spring.\n\nThe Irish expect linebacker Kyngstonn Viliamu-Asa to be back to full-go around the start of the 2026 season. He is recovering from an ACL injury.",

    "description": "Kevin Stefanski, a two-time NFL Coach of the Year, interviewed for the Dolphins' vacancy.",
    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins announced their second interview in their hunt for a new head coach Wednesday morning when they confirmed Kevin Stefanski is a candidate for the job.\n\nStefanski, 43, is one of the more experienced options on the market after a six-year stint as the Cleveland Browns' head coach. During that run, he earned AP NFL Coach of the Year honors twice, making him one of 13 to be a multiple-time winner of the award.\n\nBut the two years that earned him that distinction were his only winning seasons in Cleveland and, ultimately, he couldn't overcome the Browns' Brownsiness. The team went 45-56 in the regular season during Stefanski's tenure and 1-2 in playoff games.\n\nWould he have more sustained success in Miami? Here's a look at Stefanski's case for the job:\n\nLast job: Head coach, Cleveland Browns (2020-2025)\n\nCollege: University of Pennsylvania\n\nHead coach, Cleveland Browns (2020-2025)\n\nOffensive coordinator, Minnesota Vikings (2019)\n\nQuarterbacks coach, Minnesota Vikings (2017-2018)\n\nRunning backs coach, Minnesota Vikings (2016)\n\nTight ends coach, Minnesota Vikings (2014-2015)\n\nAssistant quarterbacks coach, Minnesota Vikings (2009-2013)\n\nAssistant to the head coach, Minnesota Vikings (2006-2008)\n\nAssistant director of football operations, Penn Quakers (2005)\n\nStefanski's calm, cool leadership is his greatest strength. Amid a lot of tough circumstances in Cleveland, which included the team's fallout with Odell Beckham Jr. and Baker Mayfield, along with the disappointing acquisition of Deshaun Watson, the Browns never quite crumbled into chaos or discord.\n\nWhen Myles Garrett demanded a trade in 2025, the Stefanski-led Browns managed to navigate the situation and got a record-breaking season from the pass rusher in return.\n\nThat could be welcomed in Miami where discipline was sometimes an issue and Mike McDaniel admitted he struggled to find the answer, at times.\n\nThe concern is that Stefanski, an offensive-minded coach with a lot of experience coaching quarterbacks, cycled through 13 different starters in Cleveland. Players like Mayfield and Watson played much better football elsewhere. The Dolphins would be entrusting Stefanski to lead their uncertain quarterback situation to significantly better results than he managed with the Browns.\n\n\"I think ‘alignment' is a great word. Another way of saying it is, we are all on the same page. I think that's important. We know this, if we are plowing in the same direction, we got a chance. This thing is about a shared vision. It is not about what Kevin Stefanski wants for the Cleveland Browns. We have a vision of what this is going to look like moving forward and it's a collective vision.\"- Kevin Stefanski (via ESPN)\n\nStefanski stands out as one of the best captains on the coaching market. He's shown he has the leadership and demeanor of an NFL head coach. But if the Dolphins hope to see marked improvement on offense and defense, hiring the coach would mean there are high stakes in the hunt for coordinators and position coaches on his staff.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Dolphins Wire: Dolphins HC candidate profile: Could Kevin Stefanski right the ship?",

    "title": "My NFL awards ballot, from MVP Drake Maye to All-Pro Jalen Pitre",
    "description": "The PWFA All-Pro teams and NFL awards will be announced after the Divisional Round. Here's who I voted for.",
    "fullText": "The 2025 NFL season isn't quite in the books. But with the regular season finished, we can begin our postmortem.\n\nThat starts with league awards. As a member of the Pro Football Writers of America (PWFA), I get to cast my vote for everything from NFL MVP to All-Pro teams to digging deep to find a rookie center who made a hefty contribution (spoiler: there really wasn't one this year). This isn't the Associated Press vote, which has already been tallied and All-Pro teams have been announced. It's the PFWA version, which will roll out across a five-day stretch beginning January 19.\n\nSo, as is tradition, let's talk about who I voted for.\n\nThis was the two-man race everyone made it out to be. Maye won more games, generated one of the biggest turnarounds in NFL history and was an absolute runaway winner when it came to advanced stats. Matthew Stafford played a tougher schedule, was an absolute juggernaut at times and led the league in traditional stats.\n\nUltimately, Maye elevated his teammates more. As Bill Barnwell points out, three different Patriot wideouts ranked in the top-six when it came to catch rate over expected this fall. Either that's because Stefon Diggs (sure), Mack Hollins and Kayshon Boutte (eh....) are singular presences and some of the best receivers in the league. Or, it's because the guy throwing them the ball is putting it in places where they can make a play that other quarterbacks can't. Factor in Maye's scrambling ability and the drop-off in supporting cast between he and Stafford and, yep, that's my QB1.\n\nThis was a fierce battle between Smith-Njigba and division rival Puka Nacua. Smith-Njigba had more receiving yards, more yards per target and a slightly higher degree of difficulty via average target depth (11.3 to 9.4). Nacua had more catches, more yards per route run (3.73 to 3.61… no other qualified wideout was higher than 2.7) and a better catch rate.\n\nUltimately, JSN got the call because of what he meant to Seattle’s passing game. There was no Davante Adams to buttress him. This is a man who faced brackets throughout 2025 because teams weren’t afraid of anyone else in the Seattle passing game. Even as Sam Darnold faded he knew the easiest solution to his problems was winging the ball to his all-world wideout. That added degree of difficulty tipped the scale in the Seahawk’s favor.\n\nSchwesinger was an easy choice. No rookie shares the overall impact he had on the game, even if it meant toiling for a Cleveland defense that had to do a ton of heavy lifting.\n\nMcMillan was trickier. Tyler Shough's ability to adjust as games wore on and lead a depleted Saints offense to respectability made him a viable candidate, but he only made nine starts. Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward managed bursts of excitement against below-average play thanks to a lack of above-average veterans around them. Emeka Egbuka and Tyler Warren both faded with their teams' postseason hopes down the stretch.\n\nMcMillan, however, was a rising tide for an inconsistent Bryce Young. His ability to beat bracketed coverage to find space OR haul in contested catches through traffic made him an asset and was the difference between Carolina winning the NFC South or spending another year as an also-ran. Leading all rookies in receiving yards and receiving touchdowns didn't hurt, either.\n\nFrom missing nine games due to injury and a spot on the trading block to 100 catches and a positive influence on two different young quarterbacks. Olave proved his value in 2025.\n\nWilliams' slow starts are a concern, but he showcased his ability to rise to the moment and make the Bears a legitimate Super Bowl contender. That was more impressive than breakthrough years for Smith-Njigba, Maye, George Pickens, Will Anderson Jr., Javonte Williams or a handful of other viable candidates.\n\nLike running back, there are so many deserving candidates and so few spots. With apologies to Mike Macdonald, Mike Vrabel, Ben Johnson, DeMeco Ryans, Kyle Shanahan and Sean Payton, Coen's in-season adjustments to make a flawed Jacksonville team an absolute wagon down the stretch — maximizing Trevor Lawrence's strengths and stapling together a top-three defense over the last half of the season — made him my huckleberry.\n\nFrom 4-13 to 14-3 thanks to Maye's improvements and massive contributions from new arrivals in both free agency and the draft. That'll do it.\n\nKubiak has Seattle's defense playing like a furious swarm of bees at all times.\n\nNow, on to my first-team All-Pro picks. I'll break out a few selections I debated internally.\n\nQuarterback: Drake Maye, New England Patriots\n\nRunning Back: Bijan Robinson, Atlanta Falcons and Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts\n\nTailback is a position with two available slots and at least five worthy candidates. It hurt to leave Christian McCaffrey off the list, but his below-average running — minus-166 rushing yards over expected (RYOE) were worst in the NFL — was enough to elevate Taylor to the first team. While the Colts' star faded down the stretch he was also hamstrung by declining quarterback play that shrank head coach Shane Steichen's playbook.\n\nWide Receiver: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seattle Seahawks and Puka Nacua, Los Angeles Rams\n\nTight End: Trey McBride, Arizona Cardinals\n\nCenter: Aaron Brewer, Miami Dolphins\n\nGuard: Quinn Meinerz, Denver Broncos and Joe Thuney, Chicago Bears\n\nOffensive Tackle: Garrett Bolles, Denver Broncos and Darnell Wright, Chicago Bears\n\nDefensive End: Myles Garrett, Cleveland Browns and Will Anderson Jr., Houston Texans\n\nLet's talk about Anderson over Detroit Lions star Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nHutchinson led the NFL in pressures (89) and ranked fourth in sacks (14.5). But Anderson had 85 pressures in nearly 140 fewer pass rushing snaps. His 19.5 percent pressure rate was higher than any other full-time pass rusher but Micah Parsons (who got a first-team nod at outside linebacker despite missing the tail end of the season with a torn ACL) and Nik Bonitto (who made it at the other OLB slot).\n\nOn the other hand, Anderson got to clean up some of the chaos sewn by Danielle Hunter. Hutchinson got 11 sacks from rotational rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad, but no other Detroit Lion had more than six quarterback hits. A tough call, for sure. Anderson’s ability to do a little more with less made him the response to a question without a wrong answer.\n\nDefensive Tackle: Jeffery Simmons, Tennessee Titans and Zach Allen, Denver Broncos\n\nWith apologies to Cam Heyward, who is 37 years old and still logged more snaps in 2025 than any other interior lineman, as well as Jordan Davis and Derrick Brown (who is a 3-4 end but still fits the bill).\n\nOutside Linebacker: Micah Parsons, Green Bay Packers and Nik Bonitto, Denver Broncos\n\nInside/Middle Linebacker: Ernest Jones, Seattle Seahawks\n\nWant to hear something I hate? The PFWA has two slots for outside linebackers — ostensibly your edge rushers from the second level — but only one slot for an inside linebacker. That’s one honor for a field that includes Jordyn Brooks, Devin Lloyd, Jack Campbell and Carson Schwesinger. No matter how you fill this out, you’ll be left with a *bunch* of snubs.\n\nJones got a little credit for being the center of gravity behind the league’s top defense — though that could be overstating his skill because he was surrounded by demons in Seattle’s not-yet-determined level of hell. He was a stalwart in coverage, logging five interceptions and recording a passer rating equal to Derek Stingley’s (see below). While he didn’t offer much as a pass rusher (only 25 blitzing snaps), his run-stuffing presence and low missed tackle rate made him a reliable, set-it-and-forget-it presence in the middle of the field.\n\nCornerback: Derek Stingley Jr., Houston Texans and Quinyon Mitchell, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nI wanted to go with an unheralded name here. Did you know Donte Jackson yielded the second-lowest passer rating among full-time cornerbacks this fall? That Joey Porter Jr. allowed only five yards per target? That Tre’Davious White turned back the clock with his best season since 2020?\n\nBut, nope, Stingley and Mitchell were too overwhelming when it came to the eye test and in their numbers. Stingley allowed a 54.0 passer rating. On 43 percent of the targets thrown his way were caught. Both numbers led all full-time cornerbacks. Mitchell was one of the most-targeted cornerbacks in the NFL despite holding opponents to a 44 percent completion rate for testing him.\n\nThere was plenty of good defensive back play in 2025. Stingley and Mitchell, however, were the elite gliding over the good.\n\nSafety: Jalen Pitre, Houston Texans and Derwin James, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nNeither one of these guys is a pure over the top centerfielder. Both find ways to inject havoc into almost every drive. Pitre had four interceptions without allowing a touchdown in 58 targets this season, averaging -0.6 expected points added (EPA) per coverage play. James played at least 100 snaps lined up deep, in the slot, at linebacker or on the line of scrimmage and still finished with a 53.4 passer rating allowed, two sacks and three interceptions. The league is so much better when he's healthy.\n\nPlacekicker: Will Reichard, Minnesota Vikings\n\nPunter: Daniel Whelan, Green Bay Packers\n\nKickoff Returner: Ray Davis, Buffalo Bills\n\nPunt Returner: Chimere Dike, Tennessee Titans\n\nSpecial Teamer: Brevyn Spann-Ford, Dallas Cowboys\n\nIf a tight end finishes his season with more than a tackle per game, he's doing something right on special teams. Spann-Ford is a name you hear at Cowboys games more often than his nine catches in 2025 suggests.\n\nThat's all for now. I'll have my all-rookie team picks tomorrow.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: My NFL awards ballot, from MVP Drake Maye to All-Pro Jalen Pitre",

    "fullText": "The ultimate goal for every football player who laces up their cleats is to reach the NFL. That dream narrows quickly after high school, and even for those talented enough to play at the collegiate level, the odds of landing on a professional roster remain slim. But unlike several other sports, football requires a massive number of bodies to function, and scouts flock to end‑of‑season showcases for one reason: finding a diamond in the rough.\n\nTexas A&M has several players projected to come off the board within the first two days of the 2026 NFL Draft. For those athletes, skipping an All‑Star event might be the smart play. For others, these games represent a final opportunity to get in front of evaluators who could ultimately pound the table for them in draft rooms this spring.\n\nTaurean York has been a constant in Aggieland, staying through the coaching transition and emerging as the heartbeat of the defense. His football IQ, leadership, and command of the unit will be difficult to replace, but he played a major role in preparing the next wave of linebackers to take the reins. While he doesn’t boast prototypical size or elite speed, he consistently puts himself in a position to make plays and elevate those around him.\n\nAfter a historic junior season, York has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft and accepted an invitation to the East‑West Shrine Bowl. It’s a chance to showcase his instincts, intelligence, and competitiveness in front of NFL scouts one more time as he looks to solidify his place at the next level.\n\nInvitation Accepted@AggieFootball LB Taurean York (@TaureanYork5x) is locked in for the East-West Shrine Bowl! 👍#GigEm | #ShrineBowlWHOSNEXT 😎 pic.twitter.com/bOPLsOGjYv\n\n— East-West Shrine Bowl (@ShrineBowl) January 12, 2026\n\nThe 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl kicks off January 27 at Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "description": "The Bengals grab a top-flight talent in a new mock draft.",
    "fullText": "Pass rush was once again a hit-and-miss issue for the Cincinnati Bengals in 2025, ranking in the bottom third in sacks. Injuries to Trey Hendrickson and Shemar Stewart were the main cause, though the Bengals did get contributions from Myles Murphy and Joseph Ossai.\n\nExpect the Bengals to address the area again this offseason, in part because Hendrickson is set to become a free agent again and may end up walking.\n\nThat’s the direction the Bengals go in the latest mock draft from Pro Football Focus, going with David Bailey of Texas Tech with the 10th overall pick.\n\n\"The Bengals selected one of the best run-defending edge rushers in the first round of last year’s draft in Shemar Stewart and selected the best pass-rusher in this year’s class with Bailey here. He leads all FBS defenders in PFF grade (93.1), pass-rush grade (93.9), pressures (81) and sacks (15).\"\n\nBailey transferred to Texas Tech after a solid three years at Stanford. He burst into the national spotlight with 15 sacks, helping transform Texas Tech’s defense and vaulting them into a top-five team, a Big 12 championship and a spot in the College Football Playoffs.\n\nIf the Bengals go with Bailey, they could have the potential to sport one of the pass-rushing duos in the league with Bailey and Stewart, two young and developing talents on the edge.\n\nThe Bengals recorded just 35 sacks in 2025. A healthy Stewart and the upside of Bailey could strongly boost that number going forward.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bengals Wire: Bengals land NFL draft's 'best pass-rusher' in new mock",

    "description": "\"Who's going to watch an NFL game on the internet?\" More than 31 million people, it turns out.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, the Chicago Bears beat the Green Bay Packers in an NFL playoff game that had everything: a bitter rivalry, an old-school outdoors atmosphere, and a historic comeback (or choke-job, depending on your POV).\n\nIt also happened to be a (mostly) streaming-only game. Did you notice? Or care?\n\nI didn't. Except for about 30 seconds, when I was trying to find out what network was showing the game, and it took me a beat to realize it was on Amazon's Prime Video. Then I booted up my app and watched the game without any issue. Just like any other NFL game.\n\nIn 2026, \"Guy doesn't have a problem watching the Bears/Packers\" is a true dog-bites-man story. But that's why I'm writing about it here: Not very long ago, the idea of streaming a super-high-profile NFL game — and requiring NFL fans to \n\nNow it's a yawner: I was one of 31.6 million people who watched the game, the vast majority of whom streamed it (fans in local markets could use broadcast TV). That's a streaming record for an NFL game, and it's more than some other games got last weekend on conventional TV.\n\nAnd that tells you just how far sports and streaming have come.\n\nFlash back to 2013, for instance, and the idea of whether the \"internet\" — a catch-all term that included everything needed to get streaming video onto your screen, from web servers to fiber-optic lines to the router in your house — could support a big NFL game watched by many millions of people was an open question. \"Why Web TV Skeptic Mark Cuban Thinks Google Can Make the NFL Work on the Web,\" was an ungainly headline I tapped out at the time.\n\nBack then, the NFL and other sports giants were routinely streaming big events like the Super Bowl and World Cup — but only as a sort of secondary outlet for weirdos who didn't have traditional TV. And anyone who did stream sports had to expect to run into problems, like ESPN did when it streamed a World Cup game in 2014.\n\nA year later, the NFL put on a streaming-only game for the first time — but made sure it was a relatively niche one, and made sure that people knew it was an experiment.\n\nCut to today, and streaming is just a way we watch some football games now. Amazon pays a gazillion dollars a year to show one game a week during the regular season; Netflix has paid up to show a couple games on Christmas Day. A new deal the NFL struck with Disney last year will give the league the opportunity to sell even more games to digital players.\n\nAnd two years ago, the league passed another new threshold by moving one of its most valuable assets — a playoff game — to Comcast's Peacock streamer, where it was only available to paid subscribers. That one generated a ton of complaints from people who said they didn't want to pay another service to watch an NFL game — along with millions of sign-ups for Peacock, which showed they would.\n\nThe NFL is not ditching TV for streaming anytime soon. For many people, watching NFL games is the main reason to watch TV, and that gives the league a ton of leverage to extract ever-increasing fees from the likes of NBC and CBS. So they will almost certainly keep the majority of their games on old-time TV for the foreseeable future. But they're going to sell them to streaming platforms too — because they'll pay up to get them, and you'll pay, too.",

    "description": "Two of the NFL's least successful teams are working with multiple first round picks in 2026. How could Cleveland and New York fix things?",
    "fullText": "For three quarters of the NFL, the 2026 offseason has begun. That means Super Bowl hopes and dreams have been replaced by scouting reports and salary cap debates.\n\nThat means, for 24 teams, it's draft season.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Draft is modest when it comes to quarterback talent but still loaded with players who can change the fortunes of a franchise. Pass rushers, wideouts, cornerbacks and reinforcements on both sides of the trenches are waiting to hear their names called in April. Let's see who fits where and make some educated guesses.\n\nPlease note this draft was completed before Monday night's Wild Card game between the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers, so draft position among the top 24 picks was determined using the betting spread of that game (a projected three-point Texans win).\n\nGeno Smith can be kept for about $8 million more than his dead cap number. While he might be a useful veteran mentor, he's also the guy who flipped off his home fans in his first year in Las Vegas, so... Aidan O'Connell will probably be the experienced (well, kinda) hand that turns things over to a polished rookie next August.\n\nMendoza's elite downfield accuracy means he'll dazzle when it comes to advanced stats like completion percentage over expected (CPOE). He balances pinpoint throws with strong, quick decision making and enough athleticism to keep defenses wary of his run game. While he lacks elite physical traits, you can't argue with his outcomes. Las Vegas needs a winner -- ideally immediately given how quickly it's cycled through head coaches. Mendoza has been wrecking shop at INDIANA.\n\nMoore has more physical tools in his box than Mendoza, but he's not as polished as the Heisman Trophy winner. Still, it's not difficult to see how a quick release and the arm strength to whip a deep shot through a rapidly closing window make him a tantalizing NFL prospect.\n\nThe Oregon star can break down under pressure and will need some time to acclimate to the NFL. Picking up a wideout with the pick acquired from the Colts in the Sauce Gardner trade (or, later on, the second round acquired from the Cowboys in the Quinnen Williams trade) could find him some badly needed receiving help to ease his transition.\n\nJosh Sweat was one of the few bright spots in Arizona last fall, racking up a career-high 12 sacks in his first season with the club. Only one other Cardinal had more than two, and that was 39-year-old Calais Campbell.\n\nArizona needs help just about everywhere but tight end. Reese's versatility can help him plug holes in a few places along the defense but most notably as a pass rusher. He had 10 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in his All-American 2025.\n\nTexas Tech stud David Bailey is worth a look here, but Bain's playoff performance is too fresh to ignore. The 6-foot-3, 275 pound edge rushing monster had 5.5 tackles for loss and four sacks in the Hurricanes' first two CFP games, setting the stage for a push even further up draft boards.\n\nHis get-off and closing speed hit like a series of small explosions, making him an absolute nightmare to block and a haunting presence to escape. The Titans badly need an influx of talent; Bain may be the best raw prospect of 2026.\n\nTate's ability to create space with savvy route running, strong hands and upper crust ball tracking would be a rising tide for New York's cache of young skill players. Malik Nabers' double-teams would drop. Cam Skattebo (and Tyrone Tracy, if he ever re-enters the circle of trust) would face fewer stacked boxes.\n\nAnd Jaxson Dart, importantly, would have more options downfield that don't require him to lower his shoulder and run face-first into the concussion protocol (he probably still will. He just won't *have* to). Wideout isn't the team's biggest need, but it could be the catalyst that revives an inefficient offense.\n\nThe Browns allowed pressure on a league-high 46.5 percent of their dropbacks -- four percent higher than the second-worst Chargers, who were missing their starting tackles most of the season. Four different linemen who played at least 69 percent of the team's snaps are set for free agency. Spending room is sparse, in large part thanks to Deshaun Watson, formerly accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct and what the NFL described as \"predatory behavior,\" and his albatross contract.\n\nThe easiest fix is to find a dynamic starter on a rookie deal. Here, Cleveland has its choice. Fano gets the nod thanks to his absurd power and athleticism at 6-foot-6 and 305 pounds. That athleticism boosts his recovery when beaten, which will be an asset when squaring up with rookie mistakes and elite edge rushers.\n\nTerry McLaurin is locked in, but Jayden Daniels' targets get iffy after that. Deebo Samuel is a pending free agent. So is Zach Ertz, who is coming off a season-ending ACL tear. Daniels badly needs a boost after backsliding in 2025 due to injury and lackluster play.\n\nTyson is a jetpack. The Arizona State star is good at just about everything, but shines hardest when it comes to breaking off cornerbacks at the top of his route and creating the space for clutch pickups. Sticky hands and elite recognition make him a dynamic closer on 50/50 balls as well -- though he could stand to bulk up a bit to withstand the rigors of a 17-game season.\n\nNeeds: CB, IOL, EDGE, LB, RB, WR\n\nNew Orleans could have used Tate or Tyson. Taking a player like Makai Lemon or Denzel Boston could be a bit of a reach here. Good news! The Saints also need help at another position that would boost Tyler Shough after a promising rookie season.\n\nEnter Love, who'd be a boon to a tailback rotation that got below-average returns from Alvin Kamara and Devin Neal last fall. His value as a runner (nearly seven yards per carry the last two seasons) and receiver (280 yards, three touchdowns in 12 games this fall) give New Orleans a dynamic replacement for Kamara and rising tide to the offense, albeit at considerable expense for a running back.\n\nReleasing Jawaan Taylor could save up to $20 million in salary cap space for 2026. Jaylon Moore hasn't been great and is only under contract through 2026. Josh Simmons was uneven and injured as a rookie, though his ceiling is massive. After Patrick Mahomes faced pressure on at least 42 percent of his dropbacks in his final two games of his 2025 (two games that washed Kansas City out of the postseason race), the Chiefs reload to keep their star QB comfortable.\n\nMauigoa is a rampart in pass protection, but he's truly devastating in space where his 315-pound frame flies upfield to demolish poor, poor linebackers. He's in the running with Fano to be the first tackle off the board in 2026.\n\nTrey Hendrickson won't be coming back, leaving the league's 25th-ranked pass rush in dire need. Maybe 2025 first round pick Shemar Stewart will get there, but he was always a project whose growth was further stunted by a truly pointless contract standoff last season.\n\nBailey brings proven production that Stewart did not, racking up a Big 12-leading 19.5 tackles for loss and an FBS-leading 14.5 sacks after departing Stanford for a hefty payday at Texas Tech. His explosive get-off and devastating closing speed means he can man the second level, but at 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds he's not so small he can't handle edge duties in Ohio (Joseph Ossai, for example, only has an inch and about 15 pounds on him). He's not a perfect fit, but Cincinnati gets a chance to course correct by taking an NFL-ready pass rusher in the first round.\n\nIn theory, Miami's next coach could use this pick to pump up his offense with another athletic marvel and make tight end Kenyon Sadiq a Dolphin. But whomever succeeds Mike McDaniel badly needs to address the league's 25th-ranked defense. And, lo and behold, Miami has a need at safety and Downs has slid out of the top 10.\n\nDowns can play deep or near the line of scrimmage and line up tracking slot receivers with ease. His NFL ceiling is \"Brian Branch, but better.\" He's a fixer, plain and simple, in a Miami defense in need of playmakers.\n\nDoes Jerry Jones truly want to shore up his run defense? If so, Clemson's Peter Woods could be the call here. Is he in the market for a Trevon Diggs replacement? There's Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy, among others. But the combination of need and cost savings at a high cost position instead shift the focus to Faulk, a high potential pass rusher who could lift a team that went from a top-four pressure rate with Micah Parsons in the lineup to the middle of the NFL pack without him.\n\nFaulk brings proven production (seven sacks in 2024 before this fall's down year) and the size Cincinnati covets up front (6-foot-6, 285 pounds). He's not a one-dimensional edge rusher, either; he has legitimate chops on the ground for a defense that ranked 29th in rushing EPA allowed in 2025.\n\nThe Rams only have three pending free agents who played more than 50 percent of the teams snaps on offense or defense. All three are defensive backs, including Cobie Durant. Darious Williams is 32 years old. 2026 presents a wonderful opportunity for LA to take the draft's first cornerback.\n\nEnter Delane, who led the SEC with 11 pass breakups and hauled in a pair of interceptions in 11 games. He can be trusted in single coverage on the sideline, with fluid hips and turn-and-go speed to keep up with NFL deep threats. His trustworthiness on an island could mean more blitzes for the Rams -- and an even scarier defense.\n\nThis is a pick that may hinge on Baltimore's next head coach. But this is a franchise with a definite identity. Landing a hoss like Woods who can set a bruising tone up front would help the Ravens get back to it.\n\nWoods, a 315-pound fairy tale monster with absurd quickness and athleticism, is set to jump up draft boards at the 2026 Scouting Combine. He lands in the top half of the draft here, pairing with Justin Madubuike to give Baltimore some world-class BEEF in the middle of its line and make life easier for the defenders behind them.\n\nLavonte David cannot possibly keep doing this forever. Please welcome his replacement, a taller, faster version of Lavonte David.\n\nStyles is a former safety who plays like it (complimentary), using elite athleticism to create problems at every level. He has the speed to turn and run with slot receivers and the physicality to meet a running back at the line of scrimmage and leave him with nothing but regret.\n\nWith Moore on board, several options to punch up his receiving corps persist. But while solid wideouts will last into Day 2, there may only be one chance to draft 2026's top tight end. With apologies to Denzel Boston and Makai Lemon, Sadiq is the pick.\n\nThe Oregon tight end is an athletic marvel and solid blocker who can seal off running lanes or get out in space to deflect defensive backs. More importantly, he's got excellent speed up the seam and quick change-of-direction skills to snap off linebackers and slot corners. Pair that with solid hands and, baby, you've got a stew going.\n\nDetroit needs a pass rusher big enough to hold down the edge and the intelligence to react and adjust as plays unfold. The 6-foot-3, 265 pound Parker qualifies as a valuable counterweight to Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nThough his numbers tailed off after last year's absurd 19.5-TFL, 11-sack campaign, he remains a versatile piece with a high ceiling and useful floor. He's violent at the point of attack, using a quick punch and active hands to shed blockers, though he's fast enough to win with speed on the edge as well.\n\nByron Murphy and Isaiah Rodgers played well in 2025, but there's no such thing as too many talented quarterbacks in a defense as aggressive as Brian Flores'. Adding McCoy would create space to shift Rodgers to the slot, adding strength over the middle alongside a young player who can be trusted on the boundary.\n\nMcCoy's torn ACL kept him from shining in 2025, but his four-interception 2024 proved he's a shadow in coverage, rarely allowing space thanks to fluid hips, elite quickness and vital recognition skills. He's an asset in man coverage from the line of scrimmage, and erasing quick-outs is a specialty -- something that would be a boon for the Vikings' pressure in the pocket.\n\nThe Panthers are running out of time to decide whether Bryce Young can be their franchise quarterback. After Tetairoa McMillan and Jalen Coker made up 81 percent of their receiving output in a Wild Card loss to the Rams, it's clear Carolina could use help to maximize its young passer.\n\nLemon's size at 5-foot-10 is a concern, but putting him in a lineup across from 6-foot-4 McMillan and 6-foot-3 Coker alleviates that. More importantly, he gives the team another man coverage beater with elite acceleration and quickness who can thrive in the short/intermediate zone in the space McMillan creates.\n\nOhio State's Kayden McDonald could be an answer up front with Kenny Clark on the wrong side of 30. But cornerback is a more pressing need and a top-three prospect has slid into Dallas' range.\n\nNot a single defensive back in the Cowboys locker room finished 2025 with a passer rating under 99 when targeted. Terrell, with 22 breakups the last two seasons (and eight! forced! fumbles!) would be rain to that desert. With elite acceleration and lateral movement, he's difficult to shake -- even if he's a bit smaller than Jerry Jones might prefer at under six feet tall.\n\nSure, a quarterback would be nice here -- but Ty Simpson here feels destined to end up like Kenny Pickett before him. It could be a wideout, but with Lemon off the board Pittsburgh may opt to play into tradition and coach up a receiver selected on Day 2 instead. Thus, we get Banks, a massive lineman who can play multiple roles but, most importantly, can succeed Cameron Heyward and pair with Derrick Harmon and Keeanu Benton to give the Steelers' a terrifying young defensive front.\n\nBanks has to refine his game, but his raw talent would make him a tantalizing lump of clay for a franchise that's expertly molded defensive talent. He's explosive at the snap and elusive laterally, allowing him to shed blocks and contribute all three downs. While injury limited him to three games this season and dented his draft stock, he may be due for a pre-draft rise this spring.\n\nZion Johnson has been frustrating in his time as a Charger and headed to free agency. Jim Harbaugh can pluck a Big Ten star to replace him months after the Patriots ended his season by brutalizing poor Justin Herbert.\n\nIoane, Iowa's Gennings Dunker or Oregon's Emmanuel Pregnon could be the call here, but let's start with the Nittany Lion. He's a brick wall at 330 pounds and has the quickness and aggression to create space at the second level -- something Jim Harbaugh will absolutely love as he establishes the run.\n\nThe Eagles haven't been shy about taking a legendary offensive lineman's replacement early in the draft while he's still on the roster. Cam Jurgens was drafted in 2022 to take over for Jason Kelce. Now comes Lomu ahead of whatever Lane Johnson decides comes next.\n\nPhiladelphia's pressure rate allowed actually decreased between 2024 and 2025, but all was not well across an offensive front whose struggles tied into an overall regression this fall. Lomu is a high level athlete who adjusted to Big 12 play with aplomb, showcasing All-Pro upside for the right head coach. Given the Eagles' success with homegrown and retread blockers in the past, his upside is too much to pass up.\n\nWith a blocking upgrade secured in the top 10, the Browns take the next step to elevate whichever poor, unfortunate soul has to play quarterback next season. It's too early to write off Jerry Jeudy even after his disastrous 2025. Instead, he gets a little help -- and another big body alongside Harold Fannin Jr. to serve as a playmaking threat.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Boston is a bail out machine on jump balls, but his biggest strength comes breaking off defenders in the mid-range. That would make him kind of a super-sized Kayshon Boutte. We've seen how nicely Drake Maye has leaned on Boutte en route to an All-Pro second season, correct?\n\nThe draft board has been kind to the Bears -- even at No. 25 they have a wide array of top-level prospects to choose from at positions of need. Secondary and offensive line help is waiting, but Howell's value for the league's 27th-ranked pass rush is massive.\n\nHowell led the SEC with 11 sacks. While he doesn't have an enormous frame at 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, his versatile pass rushing attack makes him an asset even in Chicago's 4-3 alignment. His ability to use his speed to create leverage and then toss off blockers suggests he could help fix what ails the Bears.\n\nBuffalo could fall in love with a wideout here, but there will be time to address the position on Day 2. Finding a young stud who can keep the middle of the line chugging forward with both Connor McGovern and David Edwards headed to free agency, however, is a tougher call. Dunker could step in immediately to pair with O'Cyrus Torrence as a road-grading young duo at guard.\n\nThe Iowa tackle will likely kick inside due to his arm length but can hold his own on the edge if needed. More importantly, he's mean as hell, quick at the point of attack and difficult to move backward. So, pretty standard Hawkeye stuff.\n\nTrent Williams has to retire someday. We saw how lost the Niners looked without him in stretches in 2025. The Niners' postseason success has prevented them from at least a couple potential saviors earlier in round one, but they still get a good one here. Proctor is enormous; 6-foot-7 and more than 360 pounds.\n\nHe's got the strength to match that frame, but his athleticism belongs to a much smaller man -- including a 32-inch vertical leap despite being the same weight as a Smart car. He's solid as a shadow, and while pad level and lateral quickness will always be a concern with a player his size he should make an immediate impact if Williams doesn't return for 2026.\n\nAh crap, we let the Texans get another elite defensive prospect. McDonald is an anchor up front, damn near impossible to move at 326 pounds. But he's also blessed with an explosive opening salvo that fires him into gaps and shrinks pocket space from the inside-out. Now he gets to pair up with Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter.\n\nCould this be a spot for Alabama's Ty Simpson to serve as Matthew Stafford's apprentice? It's possible, but Allen's availability and the need to add dynamic, young athletic talent to the middle of the field makes the Georgia linebacker the pick.\n\nAllen can handle pass rushing duties as well as lock down the middle of the field in coverage or against the run. He's not huge at 6-foot-1 and 235 pounds, but he moves quickly and fluidity, rarely crossing himself up and sticking to receivers in coverage. He's also a bonafide thumper who can move Omar Speights into pending free agent Troy Reeder's role as a rotational presence.\n\nNew England's pass rush was a strength in its Wild Card win over the Chargers, but K'Lavon Chaisson is a free agent and Harold Landry turns 30 this summer. Reloading here would help create positional savings that will be vital once Drake Maye signs a record-setting contract extension.\n\nUiagalelei can break into the lineup as a pass rushing specialist while fleshing out his game. He's an athletic marvel who looks the part of an NFL star but still needs to refine his game. But with power and speed in droves, he'd bring a stable floor to a position of need for Mike Vrabel.\n\nCisse's turn-and-run ability and elite acceleration suggest he's going to be an absolute darling at the combine. That raw athletic ability is backed by an inconsistent approach -- his 78.9 passer rating in Columbia last season was solid but his 20-plus yards allowed per reception were not. Fortunately, he lands here with a head coach capable of extracting the very best from him.\n\nCisse occasionally plays over-excited, biting on double-moves and adding some boom-bust to his game. Mike Macdonald can fix that. If he can, there's a player with All-Pro potential waiting underneath.\n\nAlex Singleton is a pending free agent on the wrong side of 30. Denver needs a running mate next to Dre Greenlaw in the middle of the field. Hill can do that.\n\nThe Texas star is a smart linebacker who identifies plays and gets where he needs to be to stop them. His coverage continues to develop, but that's a weakness that the rest of the Broncos' defense can help cover as he develops it into a strength.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL mock draft: Can Jets, Browns double-dips save their franchises?",

    "description": "The refrain on Brian Rolapp from NFL insiders was: smart, good business sense, not a golf guy.",
    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A guess is that Brian Rolapp, the newish PGA Tour CEO, will be at the SoFi Center up the road from here Tuesday night, when Tiger Woods's TGL team takes on Steve Cohen's other New York team in the second week of the second season of the made-for-TV golf league. He was on hand last week, for the season opener. Does it matter that this is indoor, nighttime golf, a game that has been played outdoors by day for centuries? It does not. Rolapp has his eye on the real prize: In the first week, about 700,000 live viewers watched on ESPN and its broadcast cousins. Decent. Maybe the second week will be better.\n\nCome Wednesday night, Rolapp will likely be at The Breakers, the gilded five-star hotel across the intracoastal waterway from here, for a Tiger Woods birthday bash for 300. If he knows anything about Woods, he knows this kind of event is torture for him, but Woods will be there, a smile on his face, raising money for his philanthropy, the TGR Foundation. If it's important to Woods, it's important to Rolapp. Woods is a member of the PGA Tour policy board, the Tour's Enterprise Board (the for-profit arm) and the chairman of the Tour's Future Competition Committee. In addressing these matters and more - the Genesis Invitational, the Hero World Challenge - Rolapp and Woods will be the greatest Zoom buddies. Does it matter if he could not tell Chris Como from Matt Killen, to cite two of Woods's instructors from recent years? It does not.\n\nA longish preamble to a tea-leaf read of what's going on here, in this whole path-back-to-the-Tour thing, with Brian Rolapp's name and likeness all over it. When Rolapp was named the PGA Tour's new CEO, shortly after last year's U.S. Open, the refrain among people who knew him from the NFL was this: Smart, good business sense, not a golf guy. Turns out that last part, originally meant as a dis, is actually an asset (depending on your view of Monday's news). Brian Rolapp's most significant task is to get people to watch PGA Tour events, in person and, much more significantly, on any screen of their choosing. If getting Brooks Koepka back in the fold is going to help Rolapp in this cause, then he's going to do anything he can to get him back in the fold. There's no reason for him to worry about how Koepka took the LIV Golf money when he could, how he hurt the PGA Tour by leaving, how annoyed rank-and-file players will be by this easy path back. He wants the eyeballs that Koepka will bring. Full stop.\n\nIn his effort to bring back Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm (both U.S. Open winners) and Cameron Smith (winner of both the '22 Players Championship and Open Championship), the same logic will apply.\n\nWhatever happened, happened. We want 'em back.\n\nMonday's news is the opening salvo. Rolapp said in August that his goal is not \"incremental change. It's significant change.\" This is, really, the antithesis of how Augusta National and the Masters works, where the leaders there despise the word change and take all their direction from the word improvement. Golf doesn't have a tradition of \"significant change.\" Rolapp might not know and surely does not care.\n\nWhen the LIV-Tour war first heated up in the summer of ‘22, Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said, \"I am not naive; if this is an arms race and if the only weapons here are dollar bills, the PGA Tour can’t compete.\" That sounded deeply true at the time. Rolapp is here to tell you: Dollar bills are not the only weapons in the LIV-PGA Tour battle. The PGA Tour offers something LIV Golf does not and that is the freedom to make your own schedule. The door to Koepka's return began with that.\n\nAs Rolapp tries to find a path back to the PGA Tour for Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith, the same logic will apply. DeChambeau has flourished under LIV and has some bad PGA Tour memories. With Smith, it's hard to know what he cares about. Rahm could be open to the play-where-you-want argument. But he'd have to leave a mountain pile of Saudi money to do it.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the Saudis just walking away from LIV Golf. Walking away is not in their cultural business makeup. They're too rich and too smart and too ambitious. But Rolapp is going to do everything he can here to weaken LIV Golf. Working with Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and a few other key figures, he will surely pave some kind of narrow path back to the PGA Tour for Talor Gooch, Tyrrell Hatton and Joaquin Niemann and a very few other LIV players who have won on the PGA Tour.\n\nAs for Sergio Garcia, Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Patrick Reed, all winners of major events, I'm guessing Rolapp has less interest in them or he would have expanded the terms in Monday's news. Mickelson is 55 and he has expressed such disdain for the PGA Tour it's hard to imagine him coming back. Woods has never been fond of Sergio Garcia so it's not likely he pushed Rolapp to make it easy for him to return. Patrick Reed's rules debacles made him a PGA Tour outsider. As for Dustin Johnson, whoever knows with him? He can play in the Masters forever. His father-in-law is Wayne Gretzky. He has all the jet skis he needs.\n\nRolapp cannot kill LIV Golf, as the NFL helped kill off the USFL in 1986. But he can weaken it. He can diminish its star power and the appeal of the international series for emerging golf talent. If he can weaken it enough, then LIV Golf and the PGA Tour might be able to some kind of meeting of the minds, where the two leagues co-exist.\n\nIn the meantime, the CEO of the PGA Tour is screaming his unspoken message: I don't care about what happened. I want to fix what's broken now.\n\nMichael Bamberger welcomes your comments at Michael.Bamberger@Golf.com\n\nThe post What Brooks Koepka coup reveals about PGA Tour’s new leader appeared first on Golf.",

The 49ers ran all over the Packers, as Raheem Mostert produced a historic stat line, giving the Packers' offense no chance to make the game close.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKevin Durant said it best a decade ago — moms are the real MVPs.\n\nFor C.J. Stroud, that sentiment remains the foundation of a career that continues to defy the odds. After an historic rookie campaign, Stroud has solidified himself as the face of the Houston Texans, orchestrating a stunning late-season surge in 2025. Despite a 3-5 start to the year, Stroud led the Texans to nine straight wins to close the regular season, finishing 12-5 and securing a third consecutive trip to the postseason.\n\nStroud already knows what it takes to succeed on the big stage. In 2023, he became the youngest quarterback in NFL history to win a playoff game when the Texans routed the Browns in the Wild Card round. Now a seasoned veteran of the January spotlight, Stroud has won two playoff games in his first two seasons.\n\nThrough every record-breaking touchdown and every high-pressure drive, Stroud continues to credit his mother, Kimberly, for the resilience that has come to define his game.\n\nFamily ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/K6qwCA6E5q\n\nStroud's close relationship with his mom has been well documented since the Ohio State product entered the league in the fall.

Stroud.\n\nThe two have a very tight relationship. Both have been open about the hardships they faced during Stroud's childhood due to the decisions of his father, Coleridge Bernard Stroud III. The quarterback's dad has been arrested twice and is currently incarcerated on a 38-year sentence.\n\nThe arrest of the patriarch put the family \"into financial ruin.\" The four children and Stroud's mother were close to being homeless as a result.\n\n“My mom, she had to play both roles for me for a while — mother and father,\" Stroud said during the NFL Draft. \"I’m super blessed to have a mother like I do.”\n\nWith Stroud's father mostly absent during the quarterback's adolescence, it caused Stroud to mature at a young age — something that helped mold Stroud into the man he is today.\n\n\"He had a choice when his father went away,\" Stroud's mother said. \"He was going to let that motivate him and be the best or he was going to succumb to it and become a statistic of a kid whose parent did something they shouldn’t.\n\n\"I sit and I’m amazed at how resilient he is. C.J. is the most amazing human I have ever met.\"\n\nMORE: Why is C.J. Stroud's dad in prison?\n\nIn November 2023, Kimberly and C.J. launched the C.J. Stroud Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps single mothers, children of incarcerated parents, and criminal justice reform.\n\n\"There’s a lot of different passions that [C.J.] has ... [helping] single moms [is one of them] since I was a single mom,\" Stroud's mother said. \"We all started crying [during the event] because a mom, her husband’s in prison ... same situation.\n\n\"I’m really grateful that C.J. has taken the step … for a young voice in our generation to shed light on some of the issues that go on in this world.\"",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Chargers’ loss to the New England Patriots reignited frustration around one of the NFL’s most talented yet inconsistent teams.\n\nDespite having a franchise quarterback in Justin Herbert, the offense once again looked flat and out of rhythm.\n\nThe Chargers failed to find any real momentum, continuing a season defined by stalled drives and missed opportunities.\n\nThe lack of creativity under offensive coordinator Greg Roman drew plenty of criticism, and the team’s fans voiced their frustration online.\n\nAmong them was a familiar name from another sport who has supported Herbert for years but couldn’t hide his disappointment this time.\n\nPGA Tour golfer Michael Kim, a long-time Chargers fan, summed up the feelings of many supporters with his post on social media.\n\n“I’ve been a big fan and supporter of Justin Herbert, but this was really disappointing,” Kim wrote.\n\n“Not smart enough to know if it’s Greg Roman’s fault or his (prob both), but to put this offensive performance is just sad as a Chargers fan.”\n\nThe comment came after another game where the Chargers’ offense struggled to execute.\n\nDrives fizzled, play-calling looked predictable, and Herbert appeared uncomfortable for much of a difficult night against the Patriots.\n\nHerbert remains one of the most talented players in the NFL, but his playoff resume tells a different story.\n\nThe Chargers star has now made three postseason appearances in his career and lost all of them. Each defeat has added another layer of pressure to an already heavy burden.\n\nWhile Herbert’s individual numbers continue to impress, the team’s inability to translate that into meaningful playoff success has become a defining frustration.\n\nHerbert’s arm strength, accuracy, and poise are undeniable, but fans are beginning to question how long his potential can outweigh results.\n\nAs Kim’s comments showed, faith in the Chargers’ process is starting to wear thin – and until Herbert delivers in January, the criticism isn’t going anywhere.",
