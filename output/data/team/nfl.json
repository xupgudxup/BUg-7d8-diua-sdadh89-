In particular Maher employed three core practices: tuning out external criticism, focusing on process over outcomes, and embracing reflection and routine. Leaders under stress can use the same approaches to maintain composure, resilience, and continuous improvement when stakes are high.",

Over his decade as a professional athlete, he made 79.9% of the field goals he attempted and 95.5% of the extra points. And yet he was also released by 12 teams.",

    "description": "Mendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also probably be a top candidate for a job in finance.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",
