    "fullText": "Best NFL players ever on the worst teams: Myles Garrett, Calvin Johnson and the 16 most wasted talents in history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCleveland edge rusher Myles Garrett is on the edge of making NFL history.\n\nGarrett – who has 21.5 sacks – can tie the NFL single-season sack record held by former Giants star Michael Strahan and Steelers edge rusher T.J Watt with his next sack. Garrett, of course, is playing for the Browns – who have been eliminated from the AFC playoff race.\n\nThat's going to beg the question: Is Garrett the best player on the worst team in NFL history? We're not just talking about this year. We're talking for the entirety of their career.\n\nSporting News identified 16 NFL stars – including eight Pro Football Hall of Fame players – who fit that description. We ranked those players based on four categories, including worst team winning percentage, playoff appearances (fewest scored higher), Pro Bowl selections (highest to lowest) and NFL MVP or AP Defensive Player of the Year Awards. In the event of a tie, the player whose teams had a lower winning percentage wen\n\nThis balances the great player vs. how good, or in this case bad, their team was.\n\nGarrett is in the top 10 along with another active edge rusher in the NFL. Who else made the list? A look at the 16 best NFL players on the worst teams.\n\nMORE:Tracking Myles Garrett's NFL single-season sacks record chase\n\nTeams: Saints (1999-2001), Dolphins (2002-03, 2005, 2007-10), Ravens (2011)\n\nWilliams – who rushed for 10,009 yards – had a rough start in New Orleans. He played for seven different head coaches – ranging from Mike Ditka to Nick Saban – retired for a year and was suspended for another. Williams played on a 3-13 team in New Orleans and a 1-15 team in Miami.\n\nTeams: Buccaneers (1987-92), Browns (1993-95), Ravens (1996-97), Jets (1998-2003, 2005), Cowboys (2004), Patriots (2006), Panthers (2007)\n\nTeam playoff record: 4–3 (2-3 as a starter)\n\nThe Buccaneers were 28-67 in six seasons after selecting Testaverde with the No. 1 pick in the 1987 NFL Draft. Testaverde was 23-25 in three seasons with Bill Belichick in Cleveland. He spent two seasons in Baltimore before the best stretch of his career with the Jets and made a start in the 1998 AFC championship game against Denver. Testaverde reunited with Bill Parcells in Dallas and Belichick in New England late in his career. He finished with a 90-123-1 record as a starter with 46,233 yards, which ranks 18th on the all-time list.\n\nTeams: Bengals (1996-2007), Ravens (2008)\n\nAnderson – a four-time Pro Bowl selection – played for four different coaches during the late 1990s and early 2000s \"Bungles\" era, and he played on just one winning team in 12 seasons with the franchise. Anderson played in one playoff game – a heart-breaking 31-17 loss to the Steelers in the AFC Wild Card round. Anderson did reach the AFC championship game with rival Balti\n\nTeams: Colts (1983-89), Falcons (1990-93), Vikings (1994-95)\n\nHinton – a seven-time Pro Bowl selection – was the player the Colts got in the John Elway trade. Hinton was a mainstay at tackle, but the Colts had four straight losing seasons after his arrival. Hinton played in four playoff games in his career, which also had stints with the Falcons and Vikings. He probably deserves more Pro Football Hall of Fame consideration.\n\nSanders – who ranks fourth all time in NFL history with 15,269 yards – played on decent teams. Detroit had a winning record in five of his 10 seasons and made the NFC championship game in 1991. Sanders abruptly retired in 1998 after the Lions finished 5-11 in 1998. Sanders' highlight reel has been passed down a few generations – but he never played in a Super Bowl.\n\nTeams: Rams (2004-12), Falcons (2013-14), Patriots (2015)\n\nJackson played on some miserable teams in St. Louis. The Rams averaged three wins per season from 2007-11 – a stretch in which Jackson had five straight 1,000-yard seasons. He finished his career with 11,438 rushing yards, and one of his two career playoff victories was in an abbreviated final season with the Patriots in 2015.\n\nSayers had a brief-but-brilliant career with the Bears, which was cut short by injuries. Sayers played for George Halas for four seasons – a stretch where Chicago compiled a 28-25-3 record. He led the NFL in rushing with 236 carries for 1,032 yards and eight TDs in 1969, a season in which the Bears finished 1-13.\n\nTeams: Saints (1993-2001); Chiefs (2002-05)\n\nRoaf was a dominant tackle in the NFL for the Saints – and he played for three head coaches in Jim Mora, Mike Ditka and Jim Haslett. New Orleans won one playoff game – a 34-24 victory against St. Louis in the NFC Wild Card round – on Dec. 30, 2000. He played four seasons with Kansas City – including two winning teams – to end his career.\n\nTeams: Jaguars (2006-13), Raiders (2014)\n\nJones-Drew helped Jacksonville reach the AFC divisional playoffs in his second season, but it went downhill from there despite a successful career in which he finished with 8,167 rushing yards in nine seasons. MJD played on teams that won an average of three games in his final three seasons between Jacksonville and Oakland.\n\nStephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nCrosby – who has 69.5 career sacks – has been with the franchise since the move from Oakland to Las Vegas. He has endured four straight losing seasons with the Raiders and has played for three coaches in each of the last three seasons. Yet Crosby remains on a trajectory that would get him to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Browns went 0-16 in Garrett's first season, so it's technically been uphill from there. Garrett has played for the same coach for six seasons in Kevin Stefanski, and the Browns did beat the Steelers 48-37 in the AFC Wild Card round on Jan. 10, 2021. It hasn't been all bad for the former No. 1 pick.\n\nJohnson never played on a team that won a playoff game. Detroit finished 0-16 in his second season, but \"Megatron\" continued to produce at a ridiculous level. The six-time Pro Bowl selection had 122 catches for a single-season record 1,964 receiving yards in 2012. Detroit had two winning seasons in nine years with Johnson on the field.\n\nKennedy – an eight-time Pro Bowl selection – never played on a team that won 10 games or \n\nYou can't think about the Tampa Bay creamsicle jerseys without Selmon, the six-time Pro Bowl selection who dominated at defensive tackle for the Bucs despite some woeful teams. Tampa Bay went 0-14 in Selmon's rookie season, and they lost 10 or more games six times in his nine seasons.\n\nButkus – arguably the most-feared defensive player of his era – was on the same teams as Gale Sayers, but the linebacker played two more seasons. Butkus made the Pro Bowl eight times in eight seasons before his final year, in which he played just nine games. He also finished in the top five in the NFL MVP voting twice despite playing for teams that finished with records of 8-8 and 7-9, respectively.\n\nThomas is the easiest choice here. He was a 10-time Pro Bowl selection in Cleveland despite a cast of revolving door of quarterbacks and coaches through one of the most-unstable periods for any franchise in NFL history. Cleveland went 10-6 in Thomas' first season. The Browns never won more than five games over the next 10 years, and Thomas' final season was the 0-16 year in 2017. Despite that, Thomas remains one of the most-beloved athletes in Cleveland sports history.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nYou may have felt that this was the case for some time already in a matter of fact sense, but it became official on Saturday night when the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Washington Commanders. Thanks to losses over the last two weeks to the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings the Cowboys left themselves with only one path into the postseason and that was as the hypothetical winner of the NFC East. That will not come to pass as the Eagles have now won it.\n\nMuch is always made about how the NFC East has not featured a back-to-back champion since 2003 and 2004 when the Eagles did it themselves. They have put that all to an end by doing it once more and on the subject of streaks the Cowboys now have one going themselves as far as playoff absences are concerned.\n\nDallas missed the playoffs last year, they were eliminated around the same time as it happened on December 22nd, which means they have missed the postseason for two years in a row for the first time since 2019 and 2020. Then, like now, the Cowboys were in the final year of one head coach (Jason Garrett) and the first of another (Mike McCarthy). It is almost like that is not necessarily a recipe for success.\n\nThere is a lot of introspection that is necessary from the Cowboys these days and their current playoff drought is representative of that. We talk often about how this team hasn’t been the same since they were bounced from the 2023 Wild Card Round and obviously the evidence here speaks for that as well.\n\nWe now know conclusively that there are only 3 games left on the season for the Cowboys. We also know that their drought for Super Bowl and/or NFC Championship Game appearances (the drought that Stephen Jones didn’t understand to exist) will officially grow to 30 years. It is not an approximation or a rounding up.",

    "fullText": "It's going to be a Blue Christmas for Tua Tagovailoa, who has been benched by the Dolphins. With Miami breaking in a rookie QB, my NFL props are betting on RB De'Von Achane to carry the offense.\n\nSee why I'm backing Achane, Jacoby Brissett, and Aaron Rodgers with my favorite NFL player props for Week 16 in the NFL.\n\nKyler Murray who? Jacoby Brissett gone over his passing yards total in all nine of his starts this season. He has thrown the ball at least 40 times in six straight contests, averaging a whopping 45.7 pass attempts per game over that span.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have struggled to run the ball and have practically abandoned that part of their offense. They are second in the NFL in passing play percentage (65.4%), with that number ballooning to 72.5% over the last six weeks.\n\nThe Cardinals are hosting the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday in a beautiful 76-degree day at State Farm Stadium. That should lead to plenty of throwing from a pair of teams with nothing to play for except pride.\n\nWith the Miami Dolphins starting seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers at QB expect them to lean on their rushing attack against a piss-poor Bengals run defense. Cincinnati is 30th in the NFL in defensive rush EPA and allows a league-high 157.9 rushing yards per game.\n\nEven if the Bengals sell out to stop the run, they won't be able to contain Achane. They allow 5.0 yards per carry when stacking the box, and De'Von Achane averages 5.8 yards per attempt when running against a stacked box.\n\nAchane is coming off a game where he was limited to 60 yards on 12 carries due to a negative game script. However, he had rushed for more than 90 yards in his previous four contests, averaging 130.0 rushing yards per game over that span.\n\nAaron Rodgers is coming off back-to-back contests where he completed 23 passes in wins against the Dolphins and Ravens. The four-time MVP is proving that he still has something left in the tank, and he faces a struggling Detroit Lions pass defense in Week 16.\n\nThe Lions are 25th in the league in dropback EPA since Week 9. Their injury-depleted secondary is getting picked apart with Detroit allowing 24.3 completions per game over the last three contests.\n\nWith the Lions 7-point faves on Sunday, expect a negative game script for the Pittsburgh Steelers with plenty of passing. Rodgers has completed more than 20.5 passes in six of his last nine games and should eclipse that number again.\n\nAfter a red-hot start to the season, Jacksonville Jaguars running back Travis Etienne Jr. has cooled off. Etienne has logged fewer than 60 rushing yards in six of his last 10 games and is averaging just 3.8 yards per carry over that span.\n\nHe was held to fewer than 35 rushing yards and less than 3.0 ypa in two of his last three games. What's especially concerning about those numbers is that they came with a positive game script against terrible Titans and Jets defenses.\n\nHe'll have a much tougher time in Week 16 against a Denver stop unit that allows the second-fewest rushing yards per game (90.9) on 3.9 yards per carry. Etienne is at his best on outside zone runs, where he averages 6.9 yards per rush. However, the Broncos allow just 3.3 yards per rush on outside zone attempts.\n\nNew Orleans Saints wideout Chris Olave reeled in six catches for 85 yards last week. He has logged at least 62 receiving yards in six of his last nine games, and he's finally getting good quarterback play with Tyler Shough under center.\n\nOlave gets a mouth-watering matchup this week at home against the New York Jets, who traded away top corner Sauce Gardner at the deadline. The Jets are 31st in the league in defensive dropback EPA while ranking 28th in DVOA against No. 1 WRs.\n\nOlave has been the Saints' only reliable pass catcher after they traded Rashid Shaheed and Brandin Cooks, so expect him to get fed the ball. This is a five-star play according to EV Analytics, which is projecting 71.57 yards for Olave.\n\nBrissett o37.5 pass attempts (-120)\n\nRodgers o20.5 completions (-138)\n\nEtienne u60.5 rush yards (-114)\n\nOlave o61.5 receiving yards (-114)\n\nMy NFL weekly props column is 39-31 this season for +3.86 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "This 2025 NFL season hasn’t been what was expected from the Arizona Cardinals. In a division full of some of the league’s best ballclubs, the Cardinals aren’t one of them.\n\nBut there are silver linings. And with some, you don’t have to look too hard. Arizona tight end Trey McBride might be this year’s brightest star on the roster. He has already set one league record several weeks ago, and now this past weekend, he set two more.\n\nIn the Cardinals’ 40-20 loss to the Houston Texans this past Sunday, McBride had 12 receptions for 134 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead all pass catchers.\n\nAmong the flow of the game, McBride set two records: 1) “Most consecutive games by a tight end with five or more catches,” and 2) “First tight end in NFL history to have 100 catches or \n\nWith the first record, McBride now has 16 consecutive games, which broke the record of 15 held by Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2018.\n\nLast year, McBride caught 111 passes for 1,146 yards. He now has 105 passes for 1,071 this season with three games remaining.\n\nMcBride can now set his sights on the NFL record for “Most receptions by a tight end in a single season.” The record is 116 catches set by former Cardinal Zack Ertz in 2018 while he was playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. Needing an even dozen in three games shouldn’t be an issue for McBride.\n\nHe is currently ranked #1 in receptions in the league, #2 in targets, #3 in touchdowns, #4 in first down conversions, #6 in total yards gained, and #25 in pass completions of 20+ yards.\n\nTwo weeks ago, McBride broke the NFL record for the “Most receptions by a tight end in his first four seasons in the league.” The old record was set by tight end Jimmy Graham, who had 3,863 yards on 301 receptions. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 13, McBride led all receivers with eight catches for 82 yards and a touchdown, and finished with 309 career receptions. He has since added to that total.",

    "fullText": "With the College Football Playoff kicking off, here are some of the most notable NFL Draft prospects to watch for this weekend.\n\nAlabama against Oklahoma is a rematch from earlier this season. Oklahoma pulled out a close victory against the Crimson Tide 23 to 21 in that game. I expect this game to come right down to the wire once again. We have previously discussed some Alabama prospects like Kadyn Proctor, Tim Keenan III, Deontae Lawson, and Keon Sabb. The Cincinnati Bengals could be looking to add a cornerback to replace Cam Taylor-Britt going into next year. Alabama’s Domani Jackson could be a player who intrigues the Bengals. He feels like a player that could go anywhere from rounds three to five during the draft this year. While he hasn’t had the season that many expected, he is still a solid draft prospect. He is expected to run a 4.3 40-yard dash or potentially even lower. Jackson is a great athlete with return ability, an excellent run defender, and rarely misses a tackle. He has an incredible 2.6% missed tackle rate on the 2025 season.\n\nDomani Jackson (Alabama CB #1)\n-Uses his long frame to force receivers off of their route and disrupt timing of the play\n-Shows scheme flexibility and is capable in both man and zone coverage\n-Has moments where his build and toughness align effectively as a true bump and run… pic.twitter.com/CYIsf4ShLT\n\n— Owen Denny (@OwenDennyNFL) December 4, 2025\n\nOklahoma has a plethora of defensive talent that should be of interest to the Bengals. We have mentioned previously R.Mason Thomas, Robert Spears-Jennings, Kip Lewis, and Gracen Halton. Another player on that defense worth mentioning for the 2026 NFL Draft is Damonic Williams. Williams is a day three space eating defensive tackle. Williams is listed at 6’1” and 323 pounds. He does his best work as a run defender in the middle of the Sooners defense. Williams originally spent a couple of seasons playing for TCU.\n\nDamonic Williams about to wreck SEC O-Lines! 😤\n pic.twitter.com/veDDTDhX1n\n\n— The Main Line (@TheMainLinePod) May 3, 2024\n\nTexas A&M has a lot of talent in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Cashius Howell, Tyler Onyedim, and Albert Regis headline the defensive line. On the offensive line they are loaded with draft-elibile talent like Trey Zuhn III, Dametrious Crownover, Chase Bisontis, and Ar’maj Reed-Adams. If the Bengals decide to not re-sign Dalton Risner, they may look once again toward the draft for a right guard. While that isn’t a guarantee with Jalen Rivers here, it is at least worth mentioning. Reed-Adams is a right guard prospect that could come in and compete to start early. He is a mauling presence on the interior that loves to finish plays, sometimes to his own detriment with penalties. That type of nasty is something this Cincinnati team is missing.\n\nAr’maj Reed-Adams is a DAWG at Right Guard (even took some Right Tackle snaps in this one) pic.twitter.com/tmBzRySVIh\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) May 8, 2025\n\nMiami is equally as impressive on both sides of the ball in the trenches. On offense, they have Francis Mauigoa, Markel Bell, Anez Cooper, and James Brockermyer. On the defensive line they have Rueben Bain Jr., Ahmad Moten Sr., and Akheem Mesidor. Mesidor is an older prospect that will be turning 25 years old. We have seen previously with the pick of Demetrius Knight Jr., that age may not scare the Bengals off from taking an older guy on day two. Mesidor has 30 career sacks between his time at West Virginia and Miami. When healthy, he is an explosive pass rusher with a quick first step and a variety of pass rush moves in his arsenal. He has a 29.9% win rate on true pass sets during the 2025 season.\n\nAkheem Mesidor (#3) Miami vs. Notre Dame – Mesidor will turn 25 years old in April and has put up 7 sacks, 43 pressures, and 4 forced fumbles so far this season. \n\nAt 6’3” 280 pounds he offers inside and outside versatility along the defensive line. He is a high effort player,… pic.twitter.com/gZ8wqkZ7aS\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 26, 2025\n\nOle Miss will be entering this game without former head coach Lane Kiffin. Kiffin will not be coaching in the playoffs after taking the LSU job. Ole Miss still has a ton of talented players and should easily handle Tulane this weekend. Zxavian Harris is a big-bodied defensive tackle I have previously discussed. They also have Dae’quan Wright, Harrison Wallace III, and De’Zhaun Stribling as offensive weapons. Another player that continues to intrigue me is Suntarine Perkins. The Bengals have tried to use Demetrius Knight Jr. as a player that can come off the edge at times with limited results. While Knight did put up two sacks this week, it was while playing the role of a spy on Lamar Jackson. If they want a player with real pass rush juice from the linebacker position, Perkins may be there guy. Perkins had 10.5 sacks last season while playing more on the edge. This year, he has just two sacks but has shown that he can play more as an off-ball linebacker, which he needed to do at only 6’1” 210 pounds.\n\nOle Miss's Suntarine Perkins might be my favorite prospect I watched all summer. Can't remember someone his size (6-1, 210) playing on the line of scrimmage in a major conference and still being a difference maker. \n\nDon't care where he plays, I want him on my football team pic.twitter.com/EAjzxQJC8Q\n\n— Mike Renner (@mikerenner_) July 30, 2025\n\nFor Tulane, there really isn’t much to talk about for the draft. Quarterback Jake Retzlaff is a transfer from BYU that might get a camp invitation. He is unlikely to be on a roster in the NFL next year. The best prospect for them is defensive tackle/defensive end Santana Hopper, but it sounds like he will be entering the transfer portal and remaining in college football next year.\n\nTulane first-team all-conference DL Santana Hopper is expected to enter the transfer portal following the College Football Playoff, sources tell @On3sports. \n\nHas 13 career sacks. https://t.co/wMrfFrcNOy pic.twitter.com/rOyVZFN4v7\n\n— Pete Nakos (@PeteNakos) December 16, 2025\n\nAnother contest that is likely to be heavily one sided features Oregon taking on James Madison. Oregon has a ton of draft-eligible talent including Dante Moore (QB), Noah Whittington (RB), Kenyon Sadiq (TE), Isaiah World (OT), Alex Harkey (OT), Emmanuel Pregnon (OG), Iapani Laloulu (OC), Matayo Uiagalelei (DE), Bear Alexander (DT), A’Mauri Washington (DT), Bryce Boettcher (LB), Jadon Canady (CB), and Dillon Thieneman (S). Thieneman is the most likely player that could end up a Cincinnati Bengal. The rangy safety prospect has good straight-line speed and has been highly productive for both Purdue and Oregon during his time in college football.\n\nDillon Thieneman vs. Indiana pic.twitter.com/WEel3shdxI\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 20, 2025\n\nSimilar to Tulane, there really isn’t much for James Madison as far as draft prospects for this year. Wayne Knight is probably the best prospect on their team. However, the running back is listed at just 5’7”. He is listed at weighing around 190 pounds and has shown impressive contact balance. Knight has rushed for almost 1300 yards in 2025. He has also added almost 400 more yards as a receiver. Knight will have to play out of his mind against Oregon for James Madison to even keep this one close.\n\nJust incredible contact balance from James Madison’s Wayne Knight to pop through here.\n\nHe’s top three in the Sun Belt in rushing yards after contact pic.twitter.com/6IELz0SmUM\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) December 6, 2025",

SAUBERT. @SEAHAWKS WIN! pic.twitter.com/VF2QElidFV\n\nThis year is the first season in which regular season overtime does not automatically end on an opening drive offensive touchdown. The only difference between regular season and playoff overtime (which eliminated “offensive touchdown on first possession wins the game” starting in the 2022 season) is that regular season OT is still just 10 minutes and not 15. Barring a defensive or special teams touchdown (or a safety), both offenses must possess the ball at least once.\n\nThe catalyst for this change was the famous Kansas City Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills AFC Divisional playoff classic in the 201 season, in which Josh Allen never touched the ball in overtime and the Chiefs scored a touchdown on the first possession and never looked back.\n\nWhile we’ve yet to see an opening drive overtime touchdown under the current rules in the playoffs, this is the first time that a team has conceded an overtime touchdown and come back to win the game. The Jacksonville Jaguars scored a touchdown against the Las Vegas Raiders earlier this season, only for the Raiders to respond with their own. Geno Smith’s winning pass to Tyler Lockett was batted down and Jacksonville won.\n\nIt’s only fitting that such a weird thing would first be done by the Seahawks. We expect nothing less.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams' Week 16 loss to the Seattle Seahawks was historic.\n\nThe Rams had everything going for them in the fourth quarter. They had a two-score lead and were dominating on both sides of the ball all night long.\n\nBut the Seahawks didn't quit and managed to rally over the final nine minutes to force the game into overtime, where Seattle again fell behind after a Rams touchdown on the opening possession of the extra frame.\n\nSeattle came storming back, though, and scored its own touchdown before securing the victory with a two-point conversion.\n\nWith the loss, the Rams became the first team since at least 1975 to gain 400 yards or more, have zero giveaways, zero sacks taken and record three or more takeaways and still lose, according to NFL stats guru Dante Koplowitz-Fleming.\n\nPreviously, teams were 79-0 when hitting those marks.\n\nThe loss was enormous for the Rams, who now fall to second place in the NFC West and into the No. 5 seed in the conference.\n\nMeanwhile, the Seahawks move into first place in the division and the No. 1 seed in the conference with two games left to play while also clinching a playoff berth.\n\nBut things are far from settled, as the Rams can still catch the Seahawks, and the same goes for the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe Niners will take the field on Monday night against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nNext week, the the Niners draw the Chicago Bears, while the Seahawks get the Carolina Panthers and the Rams face the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nWhen is Davante Adams coming back?

    "description": "Targeting value in Week 16 NFL betting? We break down three plus-money predictions worth backing, with matchup analysis, betting angles, and odds insight.",
    "fullText": "Plus-money props are where opportunity meets context, and this week offers plenty of both.\n\nA rookie quarterback heading on the road is being undervalued by the market, while two proven veterans are playing with real money on the line as contract incentives come into focus.\n\nMotivation, matchup, and usage all align to create outsized NFL picks at longer odds.\n\nSince returning to the lineup, J.J. McCarthy looks rejuvenated, throwing five touchdown passes against vulnerable Washington and Dallas defenses. The Giants profile similarly when it comes to stopping offenses near the goal line, making this another spot where efficiency should show up on the scoreboard.\n\nNew York ranks bottom five in red-zone defense and is riding an eight-game losing skid, allowing 31.5 points per game. This is a defense that struggles to stop drives, and the Minnesota Vikings are well-positioned to take advantage. McCarthy has also shown he’s not afraid to push the ball downfield, ranking second in air yards per attempt while benefiting from the second-best protection rate in the league at 88 percent.\n\nMinnesota’s red-zone tendencies further support the Over. The Vikings have been ineffective running the ball near the goal line to the point that C.J. Ham handled the short-yardage touchdown last week. As a result, Minnesota ranks among the most pass-heavy teams in the red zone. All signs point toward McCarthy clearing 1.5 passing touchdowns.\n\nStefon Diggs has incentive money firmly in play with three games remaining. He’s three receptions shy of a $500K bonus, and 13 catches away from another $500K, putting a total of $1 million on the line. Diggs has recorded at least three receptions in all but one game this season, but has been quieter recently in a pair of run-heavy matchups against the Bills and Giants.\n\nThat could change this week against Baltimore, a defense allowing the sixth-most receptions to wide receivers. If Diggs wants to make a real push toward that second incentive at 80 catches, the volume needs to start building now. With the Jets up next and a Week 18 matchup against Miami that could turn run-heavy if playoff positioning is settled, this sets up as a spot where Diggs is motivated, and the matchup finally cooperates.\n\nFollow me here, because this angle makes sense. Nick Folk has been one of the most reliable kickers in the league, converting 96.2 percent of his attempts, the best mark in the NFL. This also happens to be his final indoor game of the season before trips to the Meadowlands and Orchard Park in Weeks 17 and 18, where kicking conditions become far less predictable.\n\nFolk sits at 25 made field goals and has significant incentives in play, earning $375K at 27 makes and another $500K if he reaches 30. He kicks for an offense that struggles to finish drives and draws another favorable matchup against the Saints this week. Indoors, the leash is longer, and there’s a real chance the coaching staff is more aggressive with long attempts than they’d consider outdoors. Folk has missed just one kick all season and is 7-for-8 from 50-plus, which could turn a few borderline decisions into field goal tries with real incentive-driven upside.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Thursday delivers a slate built around one game that carries monumental weight in the NFL, as the Seahawks and Rams collide in a pivotal divisional showdown with major playoff implications on the line. While the spotlight shines brightest on the NFC West battle, the night also features a full menu of NHL action where matchups, trends and numbers create value across the board. Here are tonight’s best bets brought to you by BetOnline.ag. All new players get a 50% welcome bonus and up to $250 in free bets.\n\nRundown: A pair of 11-3 teams collide on Thursday Night Football as the Los Angeles Rams travel to Seattle to face the Seahawks, with sole possession of first place in the NFC West on the line.\n\nTonight marks uncharted territory for the NFL. For the first time in league history, two teams with 11 or more wins meet on Thursday Night Football, as the Rams and Seahawks square off with the No. 1 seed hanging in the balance. Given the stakes, the matchup has a strong case as the most significant Thursday night game the league has ever seen.\n\nAccording to FTN’s proprietary metric DVOA (defensive-adjusted value over average), these are two of the best teams ever through 14 games. The statistic has been tracked since 1978, with the 2007 Patriots ranking No. 1 all time after finishing the regular season a perfect 16-0.\n\nHistory in the making 👀\n\nWeek 15 DVOA Ratings ➡️ https://t.co/T1Gel5KrfN pic.twitter.com/azJiozirlq\n\n— FTN Fantasy (@FTNFantasy) December 17, 2025\n\nSeattle and Los Angeles have been elite on both sides of the ball, each ranking inside the top five in scoring offense and scoring defense. Much of that success has been driven by two of the NFL’s premier wide receivers. Seattle’s Jaxon Smith-Njigba leads the league with 1,541 receiving yards on 96 catches, while Los Angeles has leaned heavily on third-year wideout Puka Nacua. The Rams will likely be without Davante Adams, however, as the future Hall of Famer is dealing with a hamstring injury suffered in Sunday’s win over Detroit.\n\nWeather could also a noteworthy factor that affects the outcome. Rain is expected throughout the night in Seattle, conditions that often push offenses to lean on the ground game. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum headline the Rams’ backfield, while Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet carry the load for the Seahawks.\n\nWith first place at stake, key skill players potentially sidelined and slick field conditions in play, expect both defenses to prioritize limiting explosive plays and force long, methodical drives. A slower tempo paired with two elite defensive units points toward a tightly contested game that struggles to reach the projected point total.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Kings (14-10-9) wrap up a three-game road trip as they visit the Tampa Bay Lightning (18-12-3) at Benchmark International Arena.\n\nEntering tonight, both teams are looking to get back on track. Tampa Bay arrives after consecutive losses to the New York Islanders and Florida, while Los Angeles has dropped four straight. Defense has been a common strength, with both clubs ranking inside the top five in goals allowed. Tampa Bay sits fifth and Los Angeles second, with each allowing 2.6 goals per game. That combined average of 5.2 goals comes in slightly below tonight’s projected total.\n\nDefense has not been the lone driver of Tampa Bay’s success this season. Through 33 games, the Lightning are averaging 3.2 goals per game, eighth-best in the NHL. Strong play at both ends of the ice has helped Tampa Bay post a plus-19 goal differential, which ranks fourth in the league.\n\nLos Angeles, meanwhile, has leaned heavily on its defensive structure, but its offense has lagged behind. The Kings enter with the NHL’s 30th-ranked scoring offense and will need to find some consistency to keep the losing skid from growing. With two elite defensive units on the ice, expect scoring chances to be limited and the pace to stay controlled in a low-scoring matchup.",

    "fullText": "The NFL has held at least one match on Christmas Day every year since 2020, with three 25 December fixtures scheduled in 2025.\n\nIt has previously held matches on the holiday, but between 1989 and 2019 would only occasionally schedule regular-season games on that date. This only tended to take place in years when Christmas Day would fall on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday.\n\nEarlier this season, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that from this year onwards there would be three games held every year on 25 December.\n\nSince 2021, two or three games have taken place on Christmas Day each year, with this year being a three-game day, much like in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAll three Christmas Day matches are between teams that have strong rivalries.\n\nThe Washington Commanders will host the Dallas Cowboys in the first game of the day, with the Minnesota Vikings playing at home against the Detroit Lions in the second.\n\nIn the third and final game of the day the Kansas City Chiefs face the Denver Broncos.\n\nWhile all three games kick off on Christmas Day in America, because of time zone differences the Chiefs-Broncos game will actually start in the early hours of 26 December at 01:15 GMT.\n\nStreaming site Netflix will show the first two games, as it did in 2024. The third match will be shown on Prime Video.\n\nIn 1971, the NFL held its first two Christmas Day matches following the merger between the American Football League and National Football League in the previous year.\n\nThose two matches were play-off games and the unpopularity of the decision to host the Christmas Day double-header led to an 18-year gap before matches were played again on 25 December.\n\nThursday, 25 December 18:00: Dallas Cowboys @ Washington Commanders\n\nThursday, 25 December 21:30: Detroit Lions @ Minnesota Vikings\n\nFriday, 26 December 01:15: Denver Broncos @ Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy are there NFL matches on Thanksgiving?\n\nWhy do some NFL rookies struggle in their second year?\n\nWhat are the differences between NFL wide receivers and tight ends?\n\nHow does studying game film work in American football?",

    "description": "Rams vs. Seahawks predictions and NFL picks for Thursday Night Football. Los Angeles stays a step ahead of Seattle.",
    "fullText": "The top spot in the NFC is on the line when the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks face off in a heavyweight Thursday Night Football matchup.\n\nMy Rams vs Seahawks predictions and NFL picks side with the visiting Rams, who have a lot of betting trends on their side.\n\nKickoff is set for 8:15 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in beautiful Seattle, with the game airing on Prime Video on Thursday, December 18.\n\nRams vs Seahawks best bet: Rams -1 (-105)\n\nI like backing betting trends, so it’s near impossible to overlook the Los Angeles Rams in this spot at a reasonable number.\n\nLos Angeles has been one of the most reliable late-season bets in the NFL, compiling a 17–3 ATS record in their last 20 games played in the month of December. That trend has continued this year, with the Rams starting December 2–0 while piling up 86 total points against Arizona and Detroit, surpassing 500 yards of offense in both games. They’re peaking at the right time.\n\nThey’ve also dominated the spread in matchups against the Seattle Seahawks, covering 11 of the last 14 meetings, including five straight at Lumen Field. That level of consistency against a division opponent is hard to dismiss, particularly in a building that’s traditionally been difficult for visitors.\n\nRoad performance has also been a strength. Los Angeles has gone 11–2 ATS in its last 13 road games and owns a 17–5 ATS mark overall since December 1 of last season. Whether home or away, this team has shown an ability to travel and execute in high-leverage spots.\n\nEven setting trends aside, there are reasons for skepticism on the Seattle side.\n\nThe Seahawks escaped with a narrow win over the Philip Rivers-led Colts last week despite being nearly two-touchdown favorites, and while they continue to accumulate wins, Sam Darnold’s play has cooled off. It’s also very fair to question his confidence in standalone, high-pressure games after he completely melted down at the end of last season with the Vikings.\n\nThat concern is amplified by the matchup itself. The Rams are 3–0 against Darnold since the start of last season and forced him into costly mistakes, including a four-interception performance just over a month ago.\n\nTrends alone don’t decide games, but when form, matchup history, and quarterback results all point in the same direction, they deserve attention. On a short week in Seattle, the data suggests the Rams are once again positioned to continue their strong December run.\n\nIn addition to being 3-0 vs Darnold since the beginning of last season, Los Angeles has owned the Seahawks, going 11-3 ATS against them in the last 14 matchups. Look for Kyren Williams to add to his 13 total TDs vs. a Seattle defense that's allowed the most receptions in the NFL to opposing running backs.\n\nKyren Williams anytime touchdown\n\nKyren Williams Over 1.5 receptions\n\nJSN has reached the 100-yard mark in an amazing eight of his last 10 games, including going for 105 vs. the Rams on November 15. Los Angeles has allowed the sixth-most receiving yards to the wide receiver position this season.\n\nKyren Williams anytime touchdown\n\nKyren Williams Over 1.5 receptions\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba Over 95.5 receiving yards\n\nThe Rams have hit their stride during the stretch run of the season with back-to-back wins where they’ve dropped 40+ points and 500+ yards. I’m not going to stand in front of that vs Darnold, who can’t be trusted in big spots like this.\n\nWith the Rams being 17-3 ATS in their last 20 games played in December while also being 11-3 ATS in their last 14 games vs the Seahawks, I’ll happily side with them to cover.\n\nThe Under also profiles well in a matchup between two of the league’s top defenses. These teams rank second and third in points allowed and played to a 21–19 game in November that was tracking even lower before late touchdowns. Unless short fields or defensive scores swing the script, the metrics point toward a lower-scoring game.\n\nSpread: Los Angeles -1.5 (+100) | Seattle +1.5 (-122)\n\nMoneyline: Los Angeles -106 | Seattle -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 42 (-110) | Under 42.5 (-110)\n\nThe Rams are 17-3 ATS in their last 20 games played in December.

    "fullText": "NFL Mock Draft 2026: Jets opt for Oregon's Dante Moore, Chiefs replace Travis Kelce and Ohio State owns Round 1 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe College Football Playoff will feature plenty of great future NFL talent with the 12 teams making the field. While it might not be surprising Ohio State's loaded team dominates the pro prospects, 18 of Sporting News' 32 first-round projections in all are tied to CFP action.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead with five such picks, with Georgia, Oregon, Texas A&M, Alabama and Miami also in line to have multiple selections on Day 1. Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas Tech get on the board, too. That's incredible representation from three-fourths of the CFP teams, which also account for all three QBs and four of the first five overall picks.\n\nHere is the Sporting News' latest NFL Mock Draft ahead of the 2025 College Football playoff.\n\nMORE: Bills, 49ers rise as Packers fade in latest SN Power Rankings\n\n(No. 1-18 order courtesy of Tankathon; No. 19-32 from Week 16 playoff picture)\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Giants, if they stay at No. 1 overall and don't trade out of this pick for a team wanting a quarterback, should consider taking Reese as an all-around force to fix a lot of their defensive issues away from a rather productive pass rush.\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (6-5, 225 pounds)\n\nThe Raiders can't be happy with their quarterback situation post-Derek Carr, with Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett screaming that they need to go after a true, strong, accurate franchise passer solution. Mendoza looks the part with his arm and intangibles, two things that should appeal to the influence of Tom Brady.\n\nMORE: How Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman over Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin\n\nRueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-3, 275 pounds)\n\nThe Titans also don't need a QB after taking Cam Ward No. 1 overall last year, but they can go back to the Hurricanes program to get the game-changing pass-rusher they desperately need for their latest defensive reboot.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State (6-2, 200 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to stop messing around at wide receiver and give either Shedeur Sanders or a different starting quarterback a true go-to all over the field, both in the slot and outside, in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jaxon Smith-Njigba vein, only lacking the hyphen.\n\nDante Moore, QB, Oregon (6-3, 206 pounds)\n\nMoore has the leadership and intangibles to handle being the next shot at a franchise QB in New York as well as the savvy and strong arm. They also need to get a real long-term option after the Justin Fields flop.\n\nTroy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Network\n\nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (6-0, 214 pounds)\n\nThe Cardinals saw the breakdown early of pending free agent James Conner and have had an unhealthy mess of a committee trying to replace him. This may seem like a luxury pick for a team that has a lot of needs, but they can get some tackle help later and Love can be a game-changer for restoring balance and expanding the explosiveness.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC (5-11, 195 pounds)\n\nThe Saints, should they stick with Tyler Shough at QB, need to give him more weapons after depleting the receiving crops beyond Chris Olave. Kellen Moore can have some visions of Lemon being the DeVonta Smith to Olave's A.J. Brown should Shough show big improvement.\n\nMORE: Sporting News' expert predictions for 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State (6-0, 205 pounds)\n\nThe Commanders need to get younger and more impactful in their defense after things fell apart in their secondary and around Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Downs is a terrific do-everything hybrid who would be set up to make a lot of big plays in Dan Quinn's scheme.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson (6-3, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Bengals need to keep beefing up their defensive line to pull out of being atrocious against the run and it doesn't hurt to have some of Woods' inside pass-rush juice to support their end rotation.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee (6-0, 193 pounds)\n\nThe Rams know that cornerback coverage is their biggest weakness on an otherwise loaded roster, with some retooling needed. They keep up the strong defensive pick momentum with the nice-sized, tough McCoy.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT, Miami (6-6, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Dolphins need to get more offensive line help for wherever they go at QB and they can stay in town to get a long-term all-around rock in Mauigoa.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon (6-3, 245 pounds)\n\nThe Chiefs need to be feeling the imminence of Travis Kelce's retirement and can step right into drafting his dynamic go-to receiver replacement to boost Patrick Mahomes again once he returns from his torn ACL.\n\nMORE: Why it's not time to announce the Chiefs dynasty over yet\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Vikings will need to keep working on their secondary with some contract issues ahead and Delane is not that far off in battling McCoy for the status as the best corner in this class.\n\nDavid Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech (6-3, 250 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys will go to work on replacing Micah Parsons' pass rush production with this Lubbock chess piece who has all the moves to get to the quarterback as well as unique dropback coverage ability for the position.\n\nMORE: Full list of stadiums hosting 2025 College Football Playoff games\n\nKeldric Faulk, EDGE, Auburn (6-6, 285 pounds)\n\nThe Ravens should love this complete outside linebacker option who can provide power vs. the run as well as needed pass-rush juice.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Panthers have been feeling the void at linebacker for a while after it was once a strength and GM Dan Morgan should have intrigue to go for his former position with Styles, a versatile talent who makes a lot of plays everywhere along with Reese.\n\nCashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M (6-2, 248 pounds)\n\nHowell can give the Lions the needed strong complementary pass rusher for Aidan Hutchinson to relieve their secondary coverage a lot more next season.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson (5-11, 180 pounds)\n\nThe Jets, after going QB with Moore earlier in this mock, can get their Sauce Gardner replacement with the pick acquired in that trade with Terrell, brother of Falcons star A.J.\n\nMORE: Latest news on QBs entering NCAA transfer portal\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah (6-6, 302 pounds)\n\nThe Texans have gotten surprising returns from rookie Aireontay Ersery and the rest of their rebuilt line but should be in the market to boost pass protection and run blocking at either right tackle or guard with Fano.\n\nT.J. Parker, EDGE, Clemson (6-3, 265 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys shouldn't mind doubling up on pass-rush help here with Parker and Bailey, as Parker can provide more traditional burst and finishing moves from defensive end to help Quinnen Williams in Matt Eberflus' front four.\n\nCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State (6-3, 195 pounds)\n\nThe 49ers seem ready to cut ties with injured Brandon Aiyuk, which means they will need to find a dynamic speedy big target for Brock Purdy to better take advantage of his ace deep passing. Tate would be a natural fit with George Kittle and Jauan Jennings downfield.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 25 Heisman Trophy winners since 2000\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State (6-3, 326 pounds)\n\nThe Bills have been terrible against the run and McDonald is a natural and physically overwhelming run-stopper for the Buckeyes, shooting up boards with his dominant play fron the regular season.\n\nCaleb Banks, DT, Florida (6-6, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Chargers also could bolster their interior to help their front seven in multiple ways and Banks has the right kind of power and pop for Jesse Minter.\n\nBrandon Cisse, CB, South Carolina (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Seahawks didn't trade pending free agent Riq Woolen and will need to find their strong replacement outside to support Devon Witherpoon. Cissee can be seamless in the schme of Mike Macdonald.\n\nMORE: Picks against the spread for all 35 bowl games\n\nR Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma (6-2, 249 pounds)\n\nThe Buccaneers should covet this explosive pass-rusher built to thrive in Todd Bowles' scheme and help restore their old strength on the second level.\n\nTy Simpson, QB, Alabama (6-2, 208 pounds)s\n\nThe Steelers should be in the market for a starting QB early if Aaron Rodgers retires and Simpson's brand of pocket passing would provide plenty of promise.\n\nOlaivavega Ioane, G, Penn State (6-4, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Eagles have had issues at right guard this season and Ioane would be the easy upgrade coming from State College to Philly. sliding over from his left side position in college to start right away and upgrade over Tyler Steen.\n\nCaleb Lomu, OT, Utah (6-6, 304 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to rebuild their offensive line right up there with getting more reliable receivers and Lomu would be a good initial building block, going not long after teammate Fano.\n\nChristen Miller, DT, Georgia (6-3, 305 pounds)\n\nThe Bears need to work on their interior for Dennis Allen's front and Miller would be ideal to help them with their own run-stopping problems.\n\nKC Concepcion, WR, Texas A&M (5-11, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Patriots should love what this dynamic slot can do as the ideal fit in Josh McDaniels' offense to make big plays in the open field after the catch and upgrade over Pop Douglas and other complements to Stefon Diggs.\n\nMORE: Updated list of every college coaching change for 2026\n\nKadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama (6-7, 366 pounds)\n\nThe Rams can again think more about the near future with this second first-rounder with Proctor looking solid as their future long-term tackle on either the right or left side.\n\nC.J. Allen, LB, Georgia (6-1, 235 pounds)\n\nThe Broncos need to cover more ground defensively on the second level and Allen would provide that typical Bulldogs athlete who can get around well vs. run and in coverage.",

However, after losing to Buffalo in Week 15, they lost the head-to-head tiebreaker, as the Patriots and Bills split their matchups this season.\n\nThe next tiebreaker is based on wins against division opponents.

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce entered the 2025-’26 NFL season looking to win a fourth Super Bowl with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, but it all fell apart in Week 15. In the fourth quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers, Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL. The Chiefs lost 16-13 and were eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nIt was a very disappointing season for Kansas City as the offense never found a consistent rhythm, even with Mahomes and Kelce playing really well. Following the game, the Chiefs’ tight end refused to speak to the media, citing that it wasn’t the right time.\n\nNow, Kelce has broken his silence on Mahomes’ brutal ACL injury, while sending a possible hint on his future with the Chiefs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jason and Travis Kelce released their “New Heights” podcast after Week 15. Many were waiting to hear what the Kansas City tight end was going to say about Mahomes, but they didn’t expect the possible hint about his future.\n\n“[Patrick Mahomes] is a fearless, fearless warrior when it comes to this football thing,” Kelce said. “He’s gonna make sure that he comes back stronger than ever. Hopefully, the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible. I know right now it’s kind of right around that, Week 1 or the beginning of the season next year. I know he’s going to be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs as soon as possible.”\n\nKelce’s decision to say “the Chiefs” instead of “we” has stirred up some discussion on social media that he has already made up his mind about retirement. In the midst of a tough 2025 NFL season, it is not shocking to hear that Kelce might have already made up his mind after coming off a loss in the Super Bowl.\n\nIf so, this means that Kelce has caught his final pass from Mahomes, as Gardner Minshew appears to be the starting quarterback for the rest of the NFL season. Based on Kelce’s comments, it seems like these will be his final three games in the NFL before entering retirement as well.\n\nFranciso Lindor Traded to LA Dodgers, and 4 Other Destinations Following Weird Trump Rumor\n\n‘We’re going no matter what’: Sirens dismiss Olympic rink worries\n\nAlex Bregman Free Agency Rumors Link Him to Surprise NL West Team in 2025",

    "description": "Jason retired from the Philadelphia Eagles in March 2024 after 13 years",
    "fullText": "Jason Kelce and his younger brother, Travis Kelce, discussed the possibility of Jason coming out of retirement on the Wednesday, Dec. 17 episode of their New Heights podcast\n\nJason told Travis that he won't be returning to the Philadelphia Eagles because he has a \"loose\" bone stuck in his elbow joint that keeps him from bending his elbow\n\nJason retired from the Eagles in 2024 after 13 years in the NFL\n\nJason Kelce isn’t looking to come out of retirement anytime soon.\n\nThe 38-year-old retired NFL star hung up his cleats after 13 years with the Philadelphia Eagles in March 2024, moving on to serve as a commentator on Monday Night Countdown.\n\nOn the Wednesday, Dec. 17 episode of his and brother Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast, the subject of Jason coming out of retirement and returning to his role as a football center came up when the brothers were discussing Indianapolis Colts quarterback Philip Rivers' return to the NFL at age 44.\n\n“What other retired player should get back out there?” Travis, 36, asked, before noting, “I mean, I know a guy still trying to prove his athleticism and trying to dunk.”\n\nBut Jason quickly shut down the idea that he would come out retirement, explaining that he has a loose bone — which he calls a \"body\" — moving around his arm.\n\n“Travis, I can't bend my elbow right now. I got a loose body,” Jason said. “I can't even touch my head right now because I got a loose body stuck in my f------ elbow joint.”\n\nAccording to the University of Colorado Anschutz sports medicine department, “Loose bodies can happen in your elbow which is small pieces of bone or cartilage that have broken off and are lying or floating free within the joint. This can make it difficult to bend or rotate the joint.”\n\nTravis wasn’t interested in his older brother’s reasoning, saying, “Well, go and get that s--- cleaned out, Jason.”\n\nAnd the father of four revealed, “I'm trying to avoid surgery, Travis!”\n\nTravis wasn’t deterred adding, “We gotta get some rehab going. Are we not rehabbing?”\n\n“There's not a rehab!” Jason argued. “There's just a piece of cartilage that's floating around in there, and it's stuck in my joint. I usually, I can find it and then, like, push it out of the joint and it goes back to being fine. I can't do it right now. It's, like, stuck somewhere. I don't know if it's in the back or in the front, but it isn't leaving.”\n\nAfter Travis suggested Jason “go get an MRI” to help repair the injury, Jason gave his final word, saying, “Anyways, it's not gonna be me.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe subject of Travis’ potential retirement was not discussed during the podcast appearance, though Jason did speak on it during this week’s Monday Night Countdown.\n\n\"In my opinion, to nail that decision, you gotta step away from the game for a little bit,\" Jason said about his brother's retirement plans on Monday, Dec. 15.\n\n\"Play these last three games, enjoy them with your teammates, enjoy them with your coaches... and then let it sink in. It'll come to you with time. There are so many emotions with this game right after a season, especially with the way this one's been,\" he continued.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14, officially ending their playoff chances. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes also tore his ACL during the game, putting him out of commission for months as he recovers from surgery.",

    "description": "Tua Tagovailoa's late 2025 benching is an expensive quarterback proposition for the Dolphins in 2026 unless they can trade him in the 2026 offense.",
    "fullText": "What's next for benched Tua Tagovailoa? Dolphins QB's contract, trade options cloud NFL future originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins will be missing the AFC playoffs for a second consecutive season under Mike McDaniel. While the offensive-minded coach is trying to get off the hot seat with his team eliminated from contention at 6-8, McDaniel has benched starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for poor performance in Week 16.\n\nThe Dolphins had rallied from a 1-6 start to go 5-1 with Tagovailoa at QB, but then were crushed by the Steelers, 28-15, to end Week 15 on Monday night. Although Tagovailoa didn't play well overall in that game,  it was far from his worst outing of another disappointing season. He still threw for 253 yards with 2 TDs and an INT to post a strong 113.2 passer rating.\n\nBut beyond Tagovailoa's play, there's something that has rubbed McDaniel the wrong way. Through his 14 starts, Tagovailoa still leads the NFL with 15 interceptions, a career-high total. The timing was just right for McDaniel to dive into full evaluation mode with rookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers, who will start for the Bengals at home on Sunday.\n\nTagovailoa's benching so late says the Dolphins are desperate to cut ties with him, despite how much money he's owed and uncertainty on whether McDaniel will return in 2026. Here's why Tagovailoa's near future isn't looking so good:\n\nComplete timeline of Tua Tagovailoa's injury history\n\nInside look at Tua Tagovailoa's family tree\n\nWhere does Tua Tagovailoa rank among Alabama's greatest players ever?\n\nTua Tagovailoa's net worth, from career earnings to endorsements and more\n\nTagovailoa is playing on the second year of the four-year, $212 million contract extension, his post-rookie deal. He is owed $56 million in guaranteed money as part of his 2026 compensation. If on the Dolphins' roster next March 15, that jumps up to $3 million more guaranteed from his 2027 salary.\n\nThe Dolphins, at his contract stands without a forced restructure, are stuck taking a massive hit with the release of Tagovailoa. They stand to eat $99 million-plus in dead money, either over one or two years, with a cut in 2026.\n\nThe Dolphins would not be smart to release Tagovailoa, so they would need to think a lot more about trading himif there are no more plans to start him. Trading Tagovailoa would reduce the dead cap hit to $45.2 million with $11.2 in cap money recouped. With a designated June 1 trade, that dead cap cost would be spread over two years with $43 million saved toward the 2026 cap.\n\nMORE:Which NFL coaches are on the hot seat?\n\nTagovailoa should have some interest in the outside market. For that to happen, there will need to be a new adjusted contract down to a one-year prove-it deal. Unless McDaniel is let go, it would be difficult to see Tagovailoa playing for the Dolphins in '26.\n\nThe Raiders and Jets are the two QB-neediest teams in the NFL. Then come teams such as the Steelers, who may see Aaron Rodgers retire after one season in Pittsburgh. The Saints and Browns are not yet locked into their respective non-first-round rookies, Tyler Shough and Shedeur Sanders. The Cardinals also seem headed to having a void after moving on from Kyler Murray, but they are getting some good play from Tua's former backup, Jacoby Brissett.\n\nMORE: Tyreek Hill's cryptic social media message hints at Miami departure\n\nGoing deeper, he can be a contingency plan for the Colts and Chiefs (Daniel Jones and Patrick Mahomes injuries), Vikings (J.J. McCarthy) or Rams (Matthew Stafford successor). Then again, Jones and Marcus Mariota might have more appeal as free agents and the draft should offer at least three first-round quarterbacks.\n\nWhoever takes on Tagovailoa would be taking a shot on damaged goods at still a high price in relation to how he's played in an uber-regressive 2025 season. He's headed to needing to reboot his career as a backup, following the suit of Mariota and Jameis Winston. Unfortunately, his volatility and injury-proneness say he might be more headed the way of the next Carson Wentz, a hard-fading QB with little upside.",

    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles rumor from ESPN reveals possibility of offseason A.J. Brown trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles will have a decision to make on wide receiver A.J. Brown during the offseason.\n\nBrown is unhappy with how things have gone on offense this season and he has made that publicly known. That's something the Eagles can't love, as it draws negative attention and could create problems in the locker room.\n\nThat has led many to wonder if the Eagles could trade Brown during the offseason, and ESPN's Jeremy Fowler is hearing that it's a possibility.\n\n\"I have several candidates, but let's start with A.J. Brown. The weekly concerns about Brown's messaging — from sonnets to soundbites — must be taxing on Philadelphia's locker room, even if players understand the receiver's frustration due to the limitations of the Eagles' passing attack,\" Fowler said. \"Several executives I spoke to believe the Eagles could look to move Brown, who's 28 and still has prime years left.\"\n\nAccording to Over The Cap, the Eagles would incur a $43.4 million dead cap hit in 2026 if they trade Brown before June 1. The post-June 1 trade number is more palatable at $16.3 million.\n\nIs it worth jettisoning Brown and taking on that dead cap hit in order to not have him on the team and complaining publicly anymore?\n\nWe would say no, especially with the Eagles having a huge hole to fill in their offense if they do trade him, but never say never in the NFL.\n\nAs far as compensation is concerned, we could see Philly getting a first-round pick for Brown's services, but no worse than a second-rounder.\n\nWith that pick, combined with the eight projected selections the Eagles have, they will have ample opportunity to add a replacement for Brown to pair with DeVonta Smith, who will turn into Philly's No. 1 if Brown gets traded.\n\nWe've seen the Eagles bite the bullet with dead money to unload one of their players before, so we shouldn't rule out the same happening with Brown.\n\nRaiders rumor details Las Vegas' likely exit strategy with Pete Carroll\n\nJerry Jones highly critical of Matt Eberflus, making his seat even hotter\n\nDetails behind Jets' problems with Allen Lazard revealed after WR's release\n\nZac Taylor, Duke Tobin get Bengals job security update from beat writer",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals suffered another blowout loss on Sunday. This time, it was not to an NFC West opponent. It was a 40-20 road loss to the Houston Texans. They have now lost six games in a row and 11 of their last 12.\n\nAnd in new NFL power rankings for Week 16 by USA TODAY's Nate Davis, they have fallen, which is understandable.\n\nWhere do the Cardinals rank this week?\n\nThe Cardinals now are No. 25, two behind where they were a week ago.\n\nTE Trey McBride and WR Michael Wilson are the only NFL players with at least 40 receptions since Week 11 (both have 44 during that span). Despite all their efforts, the Cards are 0-5 during that stretch.\n\nWe can add to that. Jacoby Brissett has 18 touchdown passes in nine starts. However, they are 1-5.\n\nThey have played six games since head coach Jonathan Gannon said that Brissett would have remained the starter even if Kyler Murray were healthy. They are 0-6 with a minus-95 point differential.\n\nSo it's a weird situation. Brissett's numbers look impressive on the surface. He is getting the ball to McBride and Wilson, who has gotten looks as the No. 1 receiver with Marvin Harrison Jr. missing four of the last five games. Those are good things, they also happen while the Cardinals are trailing by multiple scores. They have lost by three or more scores in four of their last six games.\n\nWhile they play the 5-9 Atlanta Falcons this week and the 4-10 Cincinnati Bengals next week, it still is hard to believe that the Cardinals will win any games the rest of the season.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

However, with Rivers at quarterback, Indianapolis ran only one such play against Seattle.\n\nWith Rivers' limited mobility, the Colts relied on pistol and shotgun formations.\n\nFrom under center, the Colts have had a very strong running game this season and a very versatile offense. From pistol or shotgun, those elements became more limited.\n\n\"Let me emphasize that point: This was, and remains, the best under-center team in football,\" wrote Solak. \"The running game, in particular, is a strength.\"\n\nSolak added, \"The Colts are highly versatile from under center. They operate a wide range of concepts with a wider set of tags and motions to those runs. With every week, they have changed.\"\n\nWhile Rivers' knowledge of Steichen's offense and his decision-making provided stability at the quarterback position, there was also a lack of explosive plays from the Colts' offense.\n\nUtilizing the quick passing game often, Solak mentions that the Colts had only two pass attempts of 20-plus yards the entire game. The play-action game was also limited as well.\n\nThe caveat to all of this, which Solak made sure to point out, was that the Colts were up against a very good Seattle defense. This, of course, factored into some of the results.\n\nSolak also says that Rivers' performance exceeded his expectations. But what Solak also saw on Sunday from the Colts was a limited playbook.\n\nSteichen has already announced that Rivers will be the Colts' starting quarterback against San Francisco this week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Why one NFL analyst wouldn't start Phillip Rivers at quarterback",

    "fullText": "Despite loss to Josh Allen and Bills, can Drake Maye still challenge for NFL MVP? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots fell back to Earth with their toughest loss of the season. It wasn’t just that they couldn’t afford to lose to the Buffalo Bills, their main divisional rival, but blowing a 21-point lead also raised questions about their status as true contenders.\n\nThe Patriots had dominated with one of the easiest schedules in the league. They even took down the Bills in their first meeting of the season, and they looked poised to make a statement again on Sunday before Josh Allen went berserk in the second half.\n\nMore than that, that loss may have also cost Drake Maye a shot at MVP. When asked about the game, however, he only talked about how bouncing back from this setback will be the actual challenge now:\n\n“Move on to next week and learn from it,\" Maye said, per NFL.com. \"It was a long stretch where we were feeling good about ourselves. Now it's about responding from losing to a good team.\"\n\nJosh Allen made a statement and proved to be the best quarterback in the league right now. He made big play after big play with a three-touchdown performance to bring his team back to seal a 35-31 win. Even so, Maye still has a chance to win MVP.\n\nThe Pats are still in control of their destiny, and at 11-3, they can be the No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the AFC. They will close out the season by facing the Baltimore Ravens before back-to-back matchups with eliminated divisional rivals, the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins. At worst, they should be able to win two of those games.\n\nDrake Maye is leading the league with a completion percentage of 70.9 percent. He has thrown for 3,567 yards and 23 touchdowns to go along with just seven interceptions and a passer rating of 109.1. He also has 362 rushing yards and four scores on the ground.\n\nOf course, Allen’s numbers aren’t half bad, either. He’s thrown for 3,276 yards, 25 touchdowns, and ten picks while completing 70 percent of his passes, all while also logging 535 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns.\n\nAllen’s numbers are slightly better, and he’s the reigning MVP and one of the faces of the league.\n\nBut if Maye leads the Patriots to a 14-win season after winning just four games last year, it’ll be almost impossible not to give him the award.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has the largest lead of the season in NFL MVP odds thanks to a slipup Sunday from the New England Patriots' Drake Maye.\n\nStafford would tie Y.A.Tittle and Rich Gannon as the oldest first-time NFL MVP (37).\n\nMaye was just held under 200 yards passing for the first time all year.\n\nOnly one top-eight finisher in last year’s MVP voting is in the race for this year’s award.\n\nStafford and Maye have been locked in a seemingly two-horse race to win the MVP trophy for more than a month.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Maye was installed as a -120 favorite, while Stafford was back around +120. The 37-year-old, 14 years the senior of Maye, reclaimed a narrow lead one week later, leading into a decisive Week 15.\n\nStafford and the Rams took down the visiting Detroit Lions, 41-34, behind their QB’s 368 yards and two touchdowns against one interception.\n\nMaye and the Pats got off to a hot start against the AFC East rival Buffalo Bills, surging ahead to a 21-0 lead in the second quarter and a 24-7 halftime score. However, their second-half collapse allowed the visiting Bills to steal a 35-31 victory.\n\nMaye was held below 200 passing yards for the first time all season. He finished with 155 passing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and an interception, while the Pats’ winning streak ended at 10 games.\n\nStafford’s shortest odds, -300 at BetMGM, translate to a 75% implied chance to win the award. Maye’s +380 at FanDuel equals a 20.8% implied chance.\n\nThe Rams finish their season by visiting the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons and hosting the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nThe Pats' three-game run includes matchups at the Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets and against the Miami Dolphins.\n\nWhile it seems hard to believe that anyone other than Stafford or Maye could win the MVP, the reigning award-winner is doing his best to surprise.\n\nBuoyed by the comeback victory on Sunday, Bills QB Josh Allen is down to around +500 at the top online sportsbooks. He had 193 passing yards and three touchdowns last weekend and is now fourth in passing TDs, sixth in QBR, and eighth in passing yards.\n\nThe closest challenger is Denver Broncos QB Bo Nix, although his lowest odds are +7,500 at bet365. That gives him just a 1.3% implied chance to take home the award.\n\nJust below Nix is Jordan Love, whose Green Bay Packers fell in Mile High on Sunday. Love is anywhere from +8,000 to +15,000 despite leading the NFL in QBR and ranking fifth in touchdowns and seventh in passing yards.\n\nThe only other player who seemingly has a chance is Sam Darnold. The long shot is +10,000 across the board as he prepares to face Stafford and the Rams on Thursday Night Football.\n\nThe 2025 NFL MVP odds race is nothing like the one a year ago.\n\nWhile Allen is still in the mix after winning last year’s award, none of the other top eight finishers a year ago are in with a shot at the 2025 MVP. Justin Herbert, who finished ninth, is about seventh in odds (anywhere from +10,000 to +15,000), and Darnold, who was 10th last year, is sixth in current odds.\n\nAssuming a quarterback wins the MVP - which seems inevitable - it will mark 13 years since a player at a different position took the award. The last to do so was running back Adrian Peterson.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Ohio State's Carnell Tate gets massive comparison to 42-TD NFL star who won national title originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes continue to be a wide receiver factory.\n\nTheir latest developmental project may just be star wideout Carnell Tate. Through nearly three seasons thus far in Columbus, Tate has continued to improve leaps and bounds, catching the attention of NFL Draft analysts and other football personnel.\n\nOne of those is ESPN's Matt Miller who confidently gave Tate an eye-popping NFL comp: Minnesota Vikings star wideout Justin Jefferson.\n\nMiller was particularly impressed with the way both men play their spots when it comes to spreading the field alongside their ability to generate yards after contact (YAC).\n\n“I know, I know… this sounds wild. But it’s on point when comparing Tate to what Jefferson was at LSU – not what he is doing now in the NFL. Both are 6-foot-3 and around 200 pounds,\" Miller wrote. \"They each excelled as route runners while also being dominant on 50-50 balls thanks to vertical skills and body-adjustment ability. “I’m not predicting Tate will take the NFL by storm and become a top player as quickly as Jefferson did, but their skill sets are very similar when evaluating where they were entering the draft.”\n\nJefferson has caught 42 touchdowns thus far through nearly six NFL seasons. His best season statistically came in 2022 when the Vikings won the NFC North with a 13-4 record. Jefferson's season saw him hit a career-high 1,809 yards while catching eight touchdowns.\n\nThe Vikings would go on to lose in the NFC Wild Card Round to the New York Giants at home, 31-24.\n\nAlthough Tate has more time to grow and develop into a big-game receiver at the next level, it's a telling sign to see that those in the know see immediate benefit for whichever team decides to draft him.",

    "fullText": "Rams vs. Seahawks prediction, odds, pick for Week 16 Thursday Night Football appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nFollowing a wild week of upsets and new storylines in Week 15, Week 16 of the NFL season will begin with this upcoming divisional tilt on Thursday Night Football. The Los Angeles Rams (11-3) will visit the Seattle Seahawks (11-3) as the two sides battle for the top of the NFC West. Check our NFL odds series for the Rams-Seahawks prediction and pick.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams continue their run atop the NFC standings with their latest 41-34 win over the Detroit Lions in Week 15. This tilt against the Seahawks will be their most critical remaining game in deciding the division, but they’ve already secured their berth to the playoffs.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks beat the Indianapolis Colts 18-16 in Week 15, marking their fourth-consecutive win. They’ve won eight of their last nine games with their lone loss during that stretch coming at the hands of Los Angeles. They’ll hope to even the rivalry as the home underdogs.\n\nNFL Odds courtesy of DraftKings\n\n*practice status as of 12/15/2025*\n\nLos Angeles: WR Jordan Whittington, Limited (back) / OL Alaric Jackson, Limited (ankle) / DE Braden Fiske, DNP (ankle) / WR Davante Adams, DNP (hamstring) / S Jaylen McCollough, DNP (illness)\n\nSeattle: LB DeMarcus Lawrence, Limited (quad) / WR Cody White, Limited (abdomen) / OT Charles Cross, DNP (hamstring)\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are 5-2 at home. The Los Angeles Rams are 5-2 on the road.\n\nThe Seahawks are 10-4 ATS overall, 4-3 ATS at home. The Rams are 10-4 ATS overall, 5-2 ATS on the road.\n\nThe Rams are 3-1 against NFC West opponents. The Seahawks are 2-2.\n\nThe Rams are 7-3 outright, 8-2 ATS in their last 10 games against the Seahawks.\n\nBoth teams are 7-2 ATS in their last nine games.\n\nSeattle is 0-5 ATS in their last five home games against the Rams.\n\nThe Rams are 11-2 ATS in their last 13 games on the road.\n\nThe most significant tidbit for either team will be the potential loss of Rams’ WR Davante Adams, who went down with a hamstring injury in Week 15. He leads the NFL in receiving touchdowns (14) and has been an integral part of the added success for QB Matthew Stafford and the busiest WR in football Puka Nacua. The injury to Adams will certainly benefit opposing defenses as they can key their efforts in on Nacua, but it was notably TE Colby Parkinson with a career day against the Lions. With all the weapons around him, Matthew Stafford and this offense are poised for a deep run in the playoffs.\n\nThe Seahawks, who fell to the Rams 22-19 five weeks ago, should rest easy knowing they lost by just a field goal despite QB Sam Darnold’s four interceptions. Their defense played well for the most part given how much time they spent on the field, so this second game at home should see a better showing from the Seattle offense. WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba is making his case for the NFC’s best offensive player as his connection with Sam Darnold has been great to watch all season.\n\nThis Rams’ defense, while solid all season, had a much more lenient effort against the Lions in Week 15. They allowed 30 or more points to their opponent for just the third time all season, the second occasion in the last three weeks. They’re 1-2 when allowing 30+ points on defense, so silencing this Seahawks’ dual-threat offense will be of utmost importance.\n\nWith the injuries seen on the Rams’ offense, expect both defenses to have a significant impact in this game. The Seahawks’ defense ranks fifth league-wide with 22 total takeaways, while the Rams are right behind them with 21 total takeaways. Neither quarterback has been perfect up to this point, so don’t be surprised if we’re in for a low-scoring game on the short week for both teams.\n\nThis matchup will have everything at-stake and while both teams are likely heading for the playoffs, their race atop the NFC West division has been the tightest we’ve seen in all the league. The Rams were the more impressive team in Week 15, but it came at a cost as several key players were banged-up in the process.\n\nThe Seahawks certainly didn’t look their best against Philip Rivers and the Indianapolis Colts, but it was a tough game to scheme against with the unpredictability of a new quarterback under center. I expect the Seahawks to look much better during this game as their defense rises to the occasion against Matthew Stafford. For our final pick, we’ll take the Seattle Seahawks to win a defensive battle at home in this one.\n\nFinal Rams-Seahawks Thursday Night Football Prediction & Pick: Seattle Seahawks +1.5 (-122); UNDER 44.5 (-115)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWe are 15 weeks into the 2025 NFL season, and some teams are jockeying for postseason position, while other players are just trying to put their best attributes on tape in hopes of improving their stock for next year. Speed is one of those key attributes that teams are always looking to stockpile.\n\nWhen the dust settled on Week 15, several playoff contenders were putting the pedal to the metal. A pair of Patriots were back in the mix once again, and one of the league's top defenders showed that speed isn't only a key asset on offense and special teams.\n\nHere is a look at the five fastest players in Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff pictures in Week 15\n\nAll speeds courtesy of NextGen stats.\n\nPlay type: 22-yard kickoff return\n\nThe New England Patriots duked it out with the Buffalo Bills in a huge AFC East divisional matchup. The Patriots had a 21-0 lead, but the Bills battled back and picked up a big win.\n\nDespite the loss, rookie wide receiver Kyle Williams tallied the fastest speed of the week on a 22-yard kick return.\n\nMORE: Ranking the greatest Patriots of all-time\n\nPatrick Surtain II was named the 2024 NFL Defensive Player of the Year for a reason. He is the top cornerback in the game, and it was evidenced by the interception that he had in Week 15 against the Green Bay Packers. Not only did he stay with wide receiver Christian Watson, Surtain II dove for the interception, making an impressive play. The victory puts the Broncos firmly in the driver's seat for the No. 1 seed in the AFC.\n\n🎮🎮🎮#ProBowlVote + @PatSurtainllpic.twitter.com/L8QeUvUxhR\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 14, 2025\n\nMORE: Updated NFL power ranking in Week 15\n\nTreVeyon Henderson is the second Patriots player on the list this week, and he's no stranger to these rankings. New England may have lost to Buffalo, but the rookie running back had another impressive performance. He finished with 148 yards and two touchdowns on 14 carries, including this one for 65 yards that saw him top out at 21.25 mph on his way to the endzone.\n\nTREVEYON HENDERSON 65-YARD TD.\n\nBUFvsNE on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/XricJljnG9\n\nWhile it didn't register for the top-five speeds, quarterback Drake Maye showed off impressive speed sprinting down the field to block for Henderson.\n\nMORE: Updated 2026 NFL Draft order in Week 15\n\nPlay type: 20-yard kickoff return\n\nKaVontae Turpin is known for his speed and frequently appears in these lists.

In Week 15, it all came crashing down.\n\nNot only were the Chiefs ruled out of playoff contention as they dropped to 6-8, but late in the fourth quarter of their loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes went down with an injury that was later diagnosed as a torn ACL.\n\nFrom the start, it appeared to be a knee injury for Mahomes, who then limped back to the locker room with trainers. Postgame, head coach Andy Reid said the injury “didn’t look good,\" leaving some worry for the potential worst-case scenario that was later confirmed: a torn ACL.\n\nHere's the latest on Mahomes' injury, as well as a breakdown of how ACL injuries have impacted players' recovery in the past.\n\nSix reasons why the Chiefs never got over Super Bowl hangover\n\nPatrick Mahomes suffers knee injury on final drive of Chiefs-Chargers\n\nChiefs officially eliminated from NFL playoffs with loss to Chargers\n\nHow long Chiefs are expected to be without Patrick Mahomes after knee injury\n\nFollowing testing, Mahomes was officially diagnosed with a torn ACL on Sunday night, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\n\"An MRI has confirmed that Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in his left knee in today’s game,\" the Chiefs said in a statement. \"Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.\"\n\nMahomes also shared a message to fans on social media.\n\n\"Don’t know why this had to happen. And not going to lie [it] hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again,\" Mahomes wrote. \"Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers.

Mahomes' is considered fully torn, per the Chiefs, but his official timetable for recovery has not yet been revealed.\n\nBecause ACLs are responsible for many rapid movements, especially in football, the average recovery time can be anywhere from 6-12 months in the NFL, with a wide range based on the extent of the tear, whether not surgery is required, the player's age, and plenty more.\n\nPer Bass Medical Group, a torn ACL that requires surgery and rehab typically carries an 8-12 month recovery timeline in the NFL. Meanwhile, a mild MCL sprain is a 2-6 week recovery, and a complete MCL rupture is 3-6 months.\n\nThe severity of a torn ACL is determined in a grading system, like some other injuries.\n\nThe least severe type of ACL injury is a Grade 1 ailment, which means the ligament was stretched but is still intact. In this case, someone may have some mild pain and swelling, but it would not require surgery.\n\nA Grade 2 ACL tear means the ligament is loose, or partially torn. Surgery may depend on the severity of the injury, as it can sometimes heal non-surgically.\n\nThe worst-case scenario with ACL injuries is a complete tear, which is a Grade 3. The ligament is in two pieces, leading to knee instability and more severe pain. This often requires surgery to repair.\n\nIn the 2025 season alone, recent NFL players to be diagnosed with torn ACLs, in some capacity, include New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz and Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr.\n\nNabers' injury came in September, and an MRI confirmed a season-ending torn ACL. He is expected to return by the start of the 2026 season.\n\nErtz's injury was more recent, as he took a big hit in Week 14 that resulted in a torn ACL diagnosis. It's unknown whether the veteran tight end will retire, but he likely wouldn't be able to return until mid-way through the 2026 season.\n\nPenix partially tore his ACL, so his was not as severe as Nabers' or Ertz's. Per ESPN, Penix underwent surgery to have his ACL reconstructed in November with a nine-month recovery period expected, with hopes that he's ready for the start of the 2026 season.",

Could not be more proud of these guys, Could not be prouder [of] our coaching staff and support system. This is [an] unbelievable run. We are playing good football. I wish we had a couple more [games] left. Maybe [a] team in Georgia. Maybe somebody else out there.”\n\nThe season might be over for Santa Margarita Catholic, but when Palmer points to his club is playing its best football of the season, he’s got a valid point.\n\nThe Eagles’ recent run of victories includes impressive wins over nationally ranked teams like De La Salle, Corona Centennial, Orange Lutheran, Mater Dei and Sierra Canyon. Palmer mentioning his wishes of his team possibly playing a team out of Georgia or somewhere else possibly points to seeing themselves crowned as a national champion of high school football.\n\nOne would have to wonder what a matchup between Santa Margarita Catholic and a team like Carrollton (Ga.), Buford (Ga.) or St. Frances Academy (Md.), which won the Overtime Nationals championship last week, would’ve been like. All we’re left with is to imagine what that could’ve turned into.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "Week 15 was a good one for the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nNot only did they snap their three-game losing streak by dominating the Las Vegas Raiders in a shutout win.\n\nThey also got some help in the form of the Dallas Cowboys, who were 5.5-point betting favorites at home, losing to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday night.\n\nThe Eagles’ magic number to win their division is now down to one.\n\nThis means the Birds can officially clinch the NFC East in Week 16 by beating the Washington Commanders in Maryland on Saturday evening.\n\nIf the Eagles lose that game, they can still clinch the NFC East on Sunday if the Cowboys lose at home to the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nIf neither result works in the Eagles’ favor, they’ll have to try again in Week 17.\n\nThe only way Dallas can win the division at this point is if the Eagles lose their final three games AND the Cowboys win their final three games.\n\nWeek 16 at Washington Commanders\nWeek 17 at Buffalo Bills\nWeek 18 vs. Washington Commanders\n\nWeek 16 vs. Los Angeles Chargers\nWeek 17 at Washington Commanders\nWeek 18 at New York Giants\n\nThe Eagles are on the precipice of becoming the first team to repeat as NFC East champions since they last did it back in 2004.\n\nElsewhere in the NFC playoff picture, the Eagles got help with both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers losing in Week 15. Those results work towards Philly not falling to the No. 4 seed, which is important since that team is likely going to have to host the second place finisher in the NFC West in the Wild Card round. Not an ideal first round matchup.\n\nThe Eagles are currently on track to be the No. 3 seed. If they end up in that position, they’ll host the No. 6 seed. The San Francisco 49ers reside in that position at this moment.\n\nIt’s possible the Eagles can climb up to the No. 2 seed, which is what they had last year. But they’d likely need to win out and also get some help with the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers dropping games. Speaking of the Packers, their defense took a major hit on Sunday with Micah Parsons feared to have suffered an ACL injury.\n\nThe Eagles are mathematically alive for the No. 1 seed but just barely. The Los Angeles Rams and the Seattle Seahawks are the strongest contenders for that spot. There’s a huge game between those two teams on Thursday Night Football to kick off Week 16.\n\nHere’s the entire updated NFC playoff picture after Week 15 (note that Monday night’s game is between two AFC teams).\n\n1) Los Angeles Rams: 11-3*\n2) Chicago Bears: 10-4\n3) Philadelphia Eagles: 9-5\n4) Tampa Bay Buccaneers: 7-7\n\n*officially clinched playoff berth\n\n5) Seattle Seahawks: 11-3\n6) San Francisco 49ers: 10-4\n7) Green Bay Packers: 9-4-1\n\n8) Detroit Lions: 8-6\n9) Carolina Panthers: 7-7\n\n11) Minnesota Vikings: 6-8\n12) Atlanta Falcons: 5-9\n13) New Orleans Saints: 4-10\n14) Washington Commanders: 4-10\n15) Arizona Cardinals: 3-11\n16) New York Giants: 2-12",

    "fullText": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — In the below-freezing tunnel of Gillette Stadium, Mike Vrabel held a stat sheet in his left hand and kept his right hand free for greetings.\n\nVrabel extended a fist bump to some of his players and a reassuring chest pat to others. He was not festive but he also was not forlorn. This was not the head-hanging or tunnel walk of silence in which losing coaches so often engage.\n\nIn fact, when tight end Hunter Henry looked down and shook his head after their encounter, Vrabel seemed intent on reminding the veteran: A 35-31 loss to the reigning league MVP and five-years-running division champions is nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n“You know what I mean? This is the National Football League,” Vrabel shouted as Henry disappeared into the locker room.\n\nMike Vrabel reassures his players as they head back to locker room after 35-31 loss to Bills snaps Patriots 10-game win streak: pic.twitter.com/9KBnUR8yYV\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) December 14, 2025\n\nBefore long, receiver Stefon Diggs rounded out the group of players to trickle off the field and Vrabel, too, disappeared into the locker room to address his squad after their first loss since Sept. 21.\n\nThe manner of losing warranted some disappointment, after the Patriots blew a 21-point lead and 17-point halftime lead to the Buffalo Bills and snapped their 10-game winning streak in a stadium where both locker rooms spoke candidly about the seeming inevitably of Josh Allen.\n\nBut there was also reason for the Patriots to appreciate, if not celebrate, the value of their first final-score adversity in months. At 11-3 and atop the AFC East, albeit now just by one game, New England is well on track to host at least one playoff game for the first time since Vrabel’s Titans upset them in a wild-card game six years ago.\n\n[Get more Patriots news: New England team feed]\n\nTriumphing in January if not also February tends to require a degree of callousing. Sunday’s game, in which the Patriots had a host of individual accolades but not the final result they coveted, provided some. No, the division-champion hats and shirts did not leave their boxes Sunday. But the Patriots may have received a more substantive gift.\n\n“It’s good for us,” said Diggs, who’s played in the NFC championship and AFC championship games with the Minnesota Vikings and Bills, respectively. “When you’re playing a team like that, they play from behind. They’re used to playing from behind, fighting back and clawing. … It’s been a while since we lost [and] we probably needed it.\n\n“It’s like a daily dose of your humble pie.”\n\nAre there lessons Patriots can only learn from losses?\n\n“100%,” Stefon Diggs said after loss to Bills. “It’s like a daily dose of your humble pie.” pic.twitter.com/r5y3R9q5l8\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) December 14, 2025\n\nCornerback Carlton Davis, who won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tom Brady, echoed the sentiment.\n\n“We don't want to go into the playoffs not having been scathed,” Davis told Yahoo Sports. “The Patriots organization hasn't been in this position in quite a minute. So it’s good to get a little taste of that playoff atmosphere.\n\n“That’s a playoff team. They go to the big dance every year. So yeah, that was a great warmup for us.”\n\nBeneath a light but steady dusting of snow, the Patriots warmed up more quickly than the Bills.\n\nQuarterback Drake Maye’s MVP case was up for trial amid a relatively soft schedule of opponents. He’d already outlasted the Bills in Buffalo and the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay. Could he also finish off the Bills at home?\n\nFinding Kayshon Boutte 30 yards down the right sideline on third-and-7 aroused the home crowd’s first outburst of “M-V-P” chants. An 8-yard touchdown on a designed run around the left end cued up another chorus.\n\nBefore the first quarter was over, Maye would also scramble up the middle of the field 7 yards for a second rushing score to double the two rushing touchdowns he’d scored in 13 prior games this season. At that point, an uninformed bystander may have confused which quarterback was the dual-threat, reigning MVP.\n\n“Just seeing the defense and trying to use my legs when I can, trying to add an extra element in the red zone to gain an extra hat,” Maye said. “And from there, try to make a play and try to get in the end zone.”\n\nMaye’s success required the Bills defense to respect his legs. That threat aided explosive rookie TreVeyon Henderson in finding creases up the middle to spring a third New England rushing touchdown, Henderson’s second-level dominance carrying him the 52 yards home.\n\nThe Patriots, up 21-0 with 5:53 to play in the first half, held a 91.1% chance of winning, per Next Gen Stats win probability data.\n\nBut that algorithm didn’t account for Josh Allen being Josh Allen … which translated statistically into rebounding from three straight punts to score five straight touchdowns.\n\nAs the third quarter waned and the fourth quarter ratcheted up Buffalo’s intensity, the Bills hit their stride.\n\nCornerback Tre’Davious White intercepted Maye with 1:39 to play in the third quarter, thwarting a chance for the Patriots to respond after the Bills had narrowed New England’s lead to three. White’s interception still set the  Bills up with a daunting 91-yard field. But Buffalo didn’t blink.\n\nAllen converted a keeper on third-and-1 and, when he failed to move the chains on a third-and-2 pass, Bills coach Sean McDermott kept his offense on the field. Facing fourth-and-3 from the 45, again everyone in the stadium was reminded that Allen is inevitable.\n\nAnd thus a 37-yard pass from Allen arrived in the arms of receiver Khalil Shakir, even as Shakir needed to stretch his arms around cornerback Marcus Jones in the process.\n\nFour plays later, on third-and-14, Allen fired a laser to tight end Dawson Knox for Knox’s second touchdown of the afternoon — and the Bills’ first lead of the game.\n\n“I saw Josh rolling out, we work the scramble drill a lot in practice and just threw a frozen rope right in my chest,” Knox said. “I had no choice but to catch that one. Just crazy scramble drill. It was just a five verticals concept. I was supposed to kind of stay on my side of the field.\n\n“Unbelievable throw by Josh Allen, man.”\n\nAnother Henderson unleashing in the form of a 65-yard touchdown (and stellar downfield blocking from Maye) wouldn’t be enough to derail the Bills’ momentum. With a 24-7 second-half advantage and heavy pressure on Maye disrupting the Patriots’ passing game, the Bills gave the Patriots a taste of the challenges that await New England in January.\n\n“That was a playoff game,” Davis said. “When you get down to the end of the season and you start talking about seeding, you start talking about division, that’s a playoff game.\n\n“Maybe we needed this loss to help us correct a couple of things. And so [we know] we’re not invincible, but still a great team.”\n\nThe Patriots want to be clear: Winning was the goal and preference Sunday.\n\n“Of course we’re not happy with that,” Henderson said after a career-high 161 scrimmage yards and two scores. “Of course we wanted to come out with the win.”\n\nBut losing a game in which they outgained the Bills 285 yards to 76 in the first half, also putting the Bills in their largest halftime hole (17 points) of the season?\n\nIf that doesn’t teach New England’s locker room the necessity of playing 60 minutes, the Patriots aren’t sure what will. Linebacker Jack Gibbens was not alone in believing that “the sense of urgency to get things fixed after a loss definitely picks up.” The blueprint that the Bills parlayed — pressure Maye into thinking about the pass rush at the expense of downfield routes, wear down a depleted New England defensive cast with extended drives — will come back to haunt the Patriots if they don’t respond accordingly.\n\nSure, Maye excites the Patriots in the present and the future, his 109.1 passer rating trailing only the Los Angeles’ Rams Matthew Stafford and Detroit Lions’ Jared Goff while his 70.9% completion percentage leads the league.\n\nMaye’s 27 offensive touchdowns are tied for seventh-most in the NFL. His accuracy, play extension and smarts to change plays at the line of scrimmage impress teammates and opponents alike. He has received comparisons to Allen.\n\nBut he’s not there yet. Because there’s a belief that teams develop when a quarterback has already proven they can win and rebound repeatedly in improbable circumstances. The MVPs of recent history have done that. There were days when one just could not explain Allen or Patrick Mahomes or Lamar Jackson or Aaron Rodgers.\n\nMaye, meanwhile, has helped the Patriots start fast and survive attempts to thwart wins. He will continue to build his arsenal of late-game comebacks and fourth-quarter elevations as Allen has in a career that’s already earned him an MVP, albeit not yet the Super Bowl title he eyes.\n\nVrabel will tell Maye, as he tells all his players, that losses like Sunday’s are part of that climb. They’re part of the pursuit of greatness and they’re part of the maturation process that will sharpen a team when games don’t just resemble playoff environments but also carry the elimination actualities. Next week’s visit to the Baltimore Ravens will present yet another chance.\n\nThat sense of resolve settled over the Patriots as the rawness of their loss softened slightly.\n\nVrabel’s call to Henry that “this is the National Football League” didn’t compel the tight end to turn back on his dejected entrance into the locker room. But 16 minutes later, as Hunter addressed reporters from his locker, he had absorbed — consciously or subconsciously — the message.\n\n“This definitely can be a kind of kick in the butt,” Henry said. “We’ve had things go our way and everything go our way the last 10 weeks, so this is definitely a reality check.\n\n“That’s a good football team. We went toe to toe with them in every aspect. But we have to give them credit.\n\n“We’ve got to get a lot better from this — fast.”",

    "title": "2026 NFL Draft Order: NY Giants still hold No. 1 overall pick",
    "description": "The NY Giants hold the No.1 pick after their eighth consecutive loss.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants suffered a frustrating 29-21 loss to the Washington Commanders on Sunday as they returned from their bye week. As a result, the Giants continued to hold the No.1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThere were some flashes, like Abdul Carter having a breakout game, big plays from tight ends Daniel Bellinger and Theo Johnson, DB Dru Phillips, and RB Tyrone Tracy. But there were simply too many miscues and missed opportunities to overcome with late magic. But ultimately it was too little, too late for the Giants and their frantic comeback fell short.\n\nThe loss also highlighted the shortcomings of the Giants’ roster, as the receivers consistently failed to get open, once again forcing Jaxson Dart to hold the ball or take a big hit when scrambling, and struggled to hang onto the ball when they did find separation. This was also (probably) Jermaine Eluemunor’s worst game of the season, as he struggled against veteran pass rusher Von Miller, and the Giants struggled to consistently move the ball in short-yardage situations on the ground.\n\nThe Giants’ eighth-consecutive loss comes one day after Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThat brings us to the upside of the loss for the Giants: there are a number of quarterback-needy teams in the Top 10 of the draft, and it’s possible that Mendoza will be the only highly-regarded quarterback to come out this year. That could make the first overall pick highly valuable if teams like the New York Jets, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns, and New Orleans Saints are all vying for the top quarterback prospect.\n\nNobody wants to see the Giants lose, but trading the first overall pick could net valuable assets to fill multiple holes in the first two or three rounds. The Giants could use a highly-drafted receiver as well as a long-term answer at right tackle. Likewise, the Giants need a long-term answer at right guard and an infusion of youth and athleticism at linebacker.\n\nMost early mock drafts have the Giants drafting a wide receiver or an offensive tackle with their first pick. A sizeable haul of picks could allow them to address both positions with high picks, as well as add one of the talented linebackers or defensive backs in this class.\n\nIt remains to be seen who will make that pick, but the Giants could have a tremendous amount of capital to go with a young roster.\n\nThe Giants’ road to the first overall pick is a tight one. They share a 2-12 record with the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders (who they play in two weeks). The Jets, Browns, and Arizona Cardinals are also each a game out of the first pick at 3-11, though the Saints managed to beat the Carolina Panthers and improve to 4-10 on the season.\n\nNew York still has games against the Minnesota Vikings, the afore-mentioned Raiders, and the Dallas Cowboys to end the season. They remain a team that can compete with any in the NFL, as well as lose to any in the NFL, so no outcome between 1st and 10th overall is out of the question.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch the NFL game tonight\n\nEntering the final quarter of the NFL season, it’s officially do-or-die for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSitting at a precarious 6-6-1 after a damaging Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions, the Cowboys are clinging to life in the NFC playoff picture. The road to the NFC East crown has become a steep uphill climb, with the division-leading Philadelphia Eagles holding a significant advantage at 8-5. For Dallas, the margin for error has evaporated; it can no longer afford the inconsistent performances that have defined its season.\n\nWith the NFC wild-card race stacked — featuring contenders like the Lions, Panthers and Buccaneers — the Cowboys need a near-perfect run to separate themselves. Their remaining schedule features three of four games against NFC opponents with playoff implications. The crucible begins immediately in Week 15 with a pivotal home Sunday Night Football clash against the Minnesota Vikings (5-8).\n\nWhile Minnesota will almost certainly miss the playoffs, it provides a tough matchup for Dallas. The Vikings' defense is coming off a game where it shut out the Commanders, forcing three turnovers and giving up just over 200 yards in a 31-0 win. Offensively, while J.J. McCarthy has had his struggles in his first year as a starter, the Vikings still have plenty of weapons to boats, including a top wide receiver duo in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison; with these two, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, the receiving talent is off the charts.\n\nDallas needs a home primetime win to keep its playoff aspirations alive, while Minnesota is looking to build on the momentum it generated last week.\n\nFollow along for all the action from AT&T Stadium.\n\nSTREAM: Watch Vikings vs. Cowboys LIVE with Peacock\n\nNFL HQ:Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\n\n10:42 p.m.: Williams is back with two big carries.

    "description": "Our Packers vs. Broncos predictions like the Green Bay moneyline on Sunday, December 14.",
    "fullText": "Two of the best teams in football collide at Empower Field at Mile High when the Green Bay Packers visit the Denver Broncos today. Kickoff is at 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS.\n\nMy Packers vs. Broncos predictions and NFL picks call for Green Bay to leave The Centennial State victorious on Sunday, December 14.\n\nPackers vs Broncos Best bet: Packers moneyline (-125)\n\nQuarterback play is the No. 1 reason I’m backing the Green Bay Packers to win on the road against the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High in Week 15.\n\nPackers QB Jordan Love paced the NFL in EPA + CPOE composite while throwing for the second most air yards during a three-game sweep of the NFC North, and Green Bay also ranks higher than Denver in DVOA.\n\nAdd the Pack pacing the league in EPA per play while playing a considerably more difficult schedule than the Broncos, and I’m confident in Green Bay leaving The Centennial State with a win.\n\nDenver has played the fifth easiest schedule per PFF and second-easiest by DVOA, after all.\n\nReturning to the QB comparison, Broncos signal caller Bo Nix ranks 18th in EPA + CPOE composite, and his 6.3 yards per attempt and 63.2 completion percentage are both also below-average marks.\n\nOf course, the Green Bay defense has also allowed the fifth-fewest yards per play and ranks ninth in defensive DVOA, and the Packers generate pressure at a respectable 12th-highest clip despite blitzing at the second-lowest rate.\n\nEven with a pair of solid defenses, I’m expecting both the Packers and Broncos to put points on the board Sunday.\n\nThey’ve both hit the Over in consecutive games, and in addition to the highlighted strength of the Love-led Packers on offense, Nix also has the Broncos ranking above average in offensive DVOA, points per game, and both EPA and yards per play.\n\nGreen Bay wideout Jayden Reed is a big-play threat as a receiver and rusher, and he’s found the end zone 18 times through 36 career games.\n\nAdditionally, while the Broncos have only allowed five touchdowns to opposing wide receivers, three of those scores have come in the past two weeks with Denver dipping to 18th in pass defense DVOA through the two-game stretch after ranking third across the first 12 weeks of the year.\n\nBroncos back RJ Harvey has found the end zone in four of the past six games for seven total touchdowns, and he’s also piled up a healthy 15 carries and five targets in the red zone during the stretch.\n\nJayden Reed Over 0.5 touchdowns\n\nSpread: Green Bay -2.5 (-110) | Denver +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Green Bay -136 | Denver +116\n\nOver/Under: Over 42.5 (-118) | Under 42.5 (-104)\n\nI’m obviously backing the Pack, and I think they’re a more complete team on offense with the defensive gap between the two teams far smaller. Additionally, the Broncos couldn’t pull away from the lowly Washington Commanders and Las Vegas Raiders the past two weeks, while the Packers just swept a tough stretch of three consecutive divisional opponents.\n\nThis spread is where things are tricky because I’m anticipating a close game, and the Broncos have won 10 straight, after all. There’s a strong case for taking the points with Denver, and I particularly think the Broncos are an excellent leg for six-point teasers with the spread moving through multiple key numbers to +8.5.\n\nAs noted, I think this total is just a touch short. Both defenses are excellent, but there are no weather concerns, and the Broncos are no slouches on offense with above-average ranks in in offensive DVOA, points per game, and both EPA and yards per play.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have won four straight road games.

    "fullText": "The 8-5 Indianapolis Colts continue their free fall, turning to Philip Rivers in their trip to Lumen Field to take on the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nMy Colts vs. Seahawks predictions are taking Indy's offense out of the equation, instead focusing on the special talent of Jaxon Smith-Njigba.\n\nFind out \n\nColts vs Seahawks Best bet: Jaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown (-120)\n\nThis is a nightmare matchup scenario for the Indianapolis Colts with the NFL's leading receiver this season lining up against them on the outside.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba has nine touchdowns this season, with multi-touchdown games in two of his last three.\n\nThe Colts have allowed 18 passing touchdowns this season to only 13 rushing touchdowns. Most of those touchdowns have come to receivers that have lined up outside compared to the slot position and on the line.\n\nSmith-Njigba has aligned out wide on 77.4% of his routes this season compared to only 14.8% of routes last season. From wide alignment, he has averaged 12.0 yards per target and caught eight touchdowns.\n\nThe Colts have only allowed 7.4 yards per target to receivers aligned out wide, but they have given up 13 touchdowns, which is tied for second-most in the NFL.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks rank third in the NFL in deep passing and seventh in long passing. Most of that is because of JSN and his ability to make big plays downfield. The Colts' defense ranks 22nd and 26th in those two categories.\n\nThis is a matchup tailor-made for Smith-Njigba to find the endzone.\n\nTo add to my best bet, I'm adding Kenneth Walker III to stay Under his rushing total, as he does most of his damage on outside runs, and the Colts are excellent at defending those.\n\nFinally, I am taking Alec Pierce to stay Under his receptions, as he is a serious deep threat mostly, and I don’t expect Rivers to be launching too many of those in his return.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown\n\nKenneth Walker III Under 57.5 rushing yards\n\nAlec Pierce Under 2.5 receptions\n\nWith Rivers starting, I expect Jonathan Taylor to be heavily involved in both the passing and running games, and he will be needed to literally do it all.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown\n\nKenneth Walker III Under 57.5 rushing yards\n\nAlec Pierce Under 2.5 receptions\n\nJonathan Taylor Over 97.5 rushing + receiving yards\n\nJonathan Taylor anytime touchdown\n\nThere is no chance that Rivers and the Colts will be able to come into Seattle and beat a team still desperately fighting for the NFC West.\n\nThe Seahawks have a great pass rush, and that is going to be trouble for a 44-year-old quarterback who hasn’t played in five years.\n\nThe Under has hit in three of the last five Colts games, and the Seahawks have only allowed nine points in the previous two games combined, and they haven’t allowed a touchdown in eight quarters.\n\nSpread: Colts +10 (-110) | Seahawks -10 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Colts +425 | Seahawks -600\n\nOver/Under: Over 43.5 (-110) | Under 43.5 (-110)\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts have only hit the moneyline in three of their last 10 away games.

    "title": "Panthers vs Saints Predictions, Picks & Best Bets for Today's NFL Week 15 Game",
    "description": "Our Panthers vs. Saints predictions see Rico Dowdle starring in a Carolina victory in Week 15.",
    "fullText": "The Carolina Panthers can take another step toward a playoff berth — their first since 2017 — with a win at New Orleans today.\n\nMy Panthers vs. Saints predictions and NFL picks call for the Panthers to roll as road favorites on Sunday, December 14.\n\nPanthers vs Saints Best bet: Panthers moneyline (-156)\n\nThe Carolina Panthers have been wandering through the desert since Cam Newton's peak. They have a seven-season playoff drought and have gone through coaches and starting quarterbacks like Gatorade cups on the sidelines under fiery owner David Tepper.\n\nDave Canales and former top overall pick Bryce Young have stabilized things, however. Carolina has already matched its best win total of the last eight seasons, and the Panthers are in first place in the division by a half game. If they win this week and next, they'll wrap up the division crown before week 17.\n\nCarolina is a road favorite this week, just the second time that's happened in three years. The Panthers haven't handled success well this season. Just as the team seems ready to take a step forward, it's fallen on its face.\n\nThat pattern includes embarrassing losses to the Bills at home and the 49ers on Monday Night Football. It also consists of a 17-7 home loss to these Saints in November.\n\nThat game was the best start of the season for New Orleans Saints rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, who had a career-high 282 passing yards against the Panthers.\n\nAs if the promise of a playoff berth weren't motivation enough, the Panthers will be looking for a bit of revenge against Shough and the Saints, whom several players on Carolina feel they may have overlooked in that first matchup.\n\nThe Saints' offense is bottom five in the league in scoring, turnovers lost, passing touchdowns, and the major rushing categories (yards, TDs, and per carry average).\n\nThe Saints have lost three straight ATS at home, and last week's upset at Tampa Bay was their first time topping the 20-point mark in eight games.\n\nBoth teams have low-scoring offenses. The Saints are in the bottom five in most categories, and Carolina is one of the five worst scorers and, other than rushing yards, is in the bottom half of the NFL in most offensive measures. \n\nThe Panthers have gone under in the last three games; their over/under was as low as 40.5, including the 17-7 (-38) loss to the Saints last month. New Orleans has gone under four of the previous five times they've seen a total of 40.5 or lower, including twice over the previous four games.\n\nThis game should be a low-scoring battle of field goals, but the Panthers will give the ball to Rico Dowdle to kill the clock in the second half. He'll likely reward them with a late touchdown to seal things in what may be the game's only trip to the end zone.\n\nAfter just over a month as a starter, the league has enough film on Shough. He had his worst passing day since his first NFL start last week at Tampa Bay (144 yards).\n\nThis week, he'll be without his top running back as Alan Kamara has been ruled out. Kamara is also a valuable dump-off passing target for Shough, who will be facing a Panthers defense that can apply pressure and force turnovers.\n\nRico Dowdle Over 56.5 rushing yards\n\nTyler Shough under 202.5 passing yards\n\nTyler Shough under 31.5 yards longest pass\n\nThe Panthers are dialed in and ready to break their win one/lose one streak, while the Saints have nothing to play for and will be down one of their top offensive contributors in Kamara. Carolina should be ready to take a step toward wrapping up the division.\n\nWhat you see is what you get with the Panthers. Their ATS outcome has matched their straight-up one for the last 10 games. This is an unfamiliar spot for them, as they haven't been a road favorite very often. Still, in a game that will likely be an old-school smashmouth affair, they should be able to control the time of possession and put the game away late with a superior running game.\n\nThis game will feature plenty of threes and a shortage of sevens. Neither quarterback is a proven playmaker. Young is in game manager mode, and, for this game, that means not taking risks and getting the team in scoring position.\n\nSpread: Panthers -2.5 (-110) | Saints +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Panthers -135 | Saints +115\n\nOver/Under: Over 40 (-110) | Under 40 (-110)\n\nThe New Orleans Saints have hit the team total Under in 12 of their last 20 games.

Cook played his first NFL snaps last week after Tyrod Taylor was hurt and is making his first NFL start on Sunday.\n\nCook was 4-of-4 on the drive, including a 25-yard strike to wide receiver Isaiah Williams that he delivered on the move to convert a third down. He is 6-of-6 for 51 yards overall.\n\nThe Jaguars opened the game with an easy touchdown drive and then had to go just 38 yards for their second score. The Jets opted to go for it on a fourth-and-1 from their 44-yard line and running back Breece Hall was dropped for a six-yard loss to set the Jags up for a Trevor Lawrence rushing touchdown.",

    "description": "Before hosting Miami in the CFP, Texas A&M Edge Cashius Howell and WR KC Concepcion are projected as first-round NFL Draft selections.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is just six days away from hosting Miami (FL) (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff, as both teams are headed to the tournament for the first time in program history, and will meet for the third time in the last three seasons.\n\nOn paper, both teams are highly similar, possessing NFL talent on both sides of the ball, and their starting quarterbacks, Marcel Reed and Carson Beck, each threw for 25 touchdowns and 10 interceptions during the regular season, connecting with elite playmakers.\n\nFor the Hurricanes, freshman wideout Malachi Toney is a nightmare matchup. At the same time, Texas A&M transfer wide receivers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver combined for over 1,700 yards and 15 total touchdowns, and are a mismatch for every secondary they've faced this season. With Craver expected to return next season, Concepcion will likely declare for the NFL Draft.\n\nOn defense, Texas A&M edge Cashius Howell and Miami defensive lineman Rueben Bain are both considered top 10 prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft, and have a chance to solidify their standing as elite pass rushers on Saturday afternoon. Either way, both players are headed to the draft regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis week, Pro Football Focus's Trevor Sikkema released his latest 2026 Mock Draft, projecting Cashius Howell as the 6th overall pick to the Washington Commanders, who would join former Texas A&M and future Hall of Fame defensive end Von Miller for at least one season.\n\nThe Commanders defense is in a bad place right now, and it starts up front. Howell will face plenty of skepticism about his draft range, given his very short arms for the position, yet he has earned pass-rush grades above 90.0 in three straight seasons, with win rates above 19.0% over that same span.\n\nConcepcion, who finished his first season in College Station with 57 receptions and a team-high 886 receiving yards and 9 touchdowns, paired with two punt return scores, is the perfect addition for any team looking for a Day 1 starting slot receiver and punt returner. According to Sikkema, the San Francisco 49ers will be looking to replace Debo Samuels for the first time in two seasons.\n\nWithout Deebo Samuel, it feels like the 49ers are missing that go-to yards after catch receiver. They are using running back Christian McCaffrey a lot for that, but it’s not quite the same as scheming things up for a receiver. Concepcion is averaging more than 7.0 yards after the catch this year and has that kind of acceleration and athleticism.\n\nFor the Aggies to have any shot at making it to the quarterfinals against No. 2 Ohio State, both Conecpcion and Howell will need to play their best football.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Two Texas A&M starters projected as first-round NFL Draft picks",

This matchup looked like it would be a clash between the best from the AFC and NFC, but there was a dramatic shift in the outlook for this game in Week 14.\n\nColts starting quarterback Daniel Jones looked like the favorite to win the league's Comeback Player of the Year with how well he had played for Indianapolis. Unfortunately, Jones, who had been dealing with a fracture in his left leg, tore his right Achilles tendon and is done for the season.\n\nAdding to the injury report, backup quarterback Riley Leonard also started the week on the injury report, leaving a huge question mark under center.\n\nSeattle has won three games in a row. Over the last two weeks, the Seahawks outscored their opponents 63-9 in a dominant stretch.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams don't have time to think about the 2026 NFL Draft just yet, but they will be in a few months. L.A. currently has two first-round picks thanks to the team's 2025 trade with the Atlanta Falcons, and could be picking in the top-10 depending on how the rest of the season pans out.\n\nIn FOX Sports draft expert Rob Rang's latest mock draft, the Rams go all offense with their first two picks. Rang predicts L.A. takes Utah offensive tackle Spencer Fano with the Falcons' pick and then comes back around with an offensive weapon at the end of the first round with Washington receiver Denzel Boston.\n\nOne of the few areas of concern for the Rams is at right tackle, where Warren McClendon has struggled with inconsistency. The 6-foot-6, 309 pound Fano is surprisingly agile with NFL bloodlines and experience playing both tackle spots.\n\nThere are a lot of gifted receiver tandems in the NFL, but few can match the Rams’ Puka Nacua and Davante Adams’ production. Both, however, have struggled with durability, which could leave Les Snead valuing Boston's similar combination of size and ball skills. With an extra first-round pick to play with, Snead might view adding yet another gifted pass-catcher for Matthew Stafford to target as a cheap and savvy insurance policy.\n\nThe picks make sense on its surface, but both would be luxury selections for the Rams.\n\nMcClendon has been playing like one of the better linemen recently in place of the injured Rob Havenstein. If he finishes strong, the Rams may not need to look at linemen early in the 2026 draft.\n\nMeanwhile, Boston doesn't fill an obvious need for L.A. Nacua will be around for a while and Adams sounds like he'll stick around as long as Stafford is on the team. The Rams have a solid depth of players behind both Jordan Whittington and Konata Mumpfield, so adding Boston now wouldn't give any of the backup receivers a chance to develop.\n\nBoston has been great for Washington over the past two years, though. The 6-foot-4, 209-pounder caught 119 receptions for 1,589 yards and 19 touchdowns over his past 24 games. Drafting him would be a future-looking move for a Rams team looking to maximize it's Super Bowl contention window.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: 2026 NFL mock draft: Rams upgrade offense in first round",

    "description": "With Stafford close to overtaking Rivers on the list (and Rivers not far behind another legendary quarterback), we could see some movement this year.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers is back. Well, sort of back.\n\nAfter working out with the Colts earlier this week following a season-ending injury to starter Daniel Jones and an undisclosed injury to backup Riley Leonard, Rivers officially ended his retirement to sign with the Colts' practice squad. But initially, it seemed Rivers was a contingency plan for the Colts, and that they were hopeful Leonard would be healthy enough to start.\n\nNow, Leonard apparently \"feels great\" and has participated in three consecutive practices as of Friday. But Colts head coach Shane Steichen, who worked with Rivers for six seasons with the Chargers, would not confirm whether or not he planned to start Rivers this weekend, increasing the likelihood that we may see the 44-year-old veteran lace up his cleats for the first time in nearly five years after retiring following the 2020 season.\n\n\"He's got great command in the huddle. He was throwing it well. So we're excited for it. He's fired up for the challenge, getting back into it, getting back in the fold, feeling the pass rush. Got some good work in that,\" Steichen said.\n\n\"I'll say it was pretty good. A guy that hasn't been out there in five years, to go and practice the way he did this week was pretty impressive to watch.\"\n\nThose sound like the words of a coach who is impressed with his quarterback, so maybe it's not so crazy to think we'll see Rivers this week. And if we do, it will be just in time to defend his spot on the NFL all-time passing yards list. You see, Rivers currently ranks seventh in career passing yards, with 63,440 yards. But behind him at number eight on the list is another active quarterback – Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, with 63,163 yards.\n\nFor those whose strong suit isn't math, Stafford trails Rivers by just 277 yards. Stafford has thrown for that amount or more six times this season, including in last week's win over Arizona, where he tallied 281 passing yards. So really, Stafford is one good game away from the record. But this all changes if Rivers gets playing time this weekend.\n\nIf Rivers is back in action, then this becomes a race. And what if Rivers does play, performs well, and is back next year? You see, Stafford is getting older as well, and is currently 37 and playing his 17th NFL season. Yes, he looks to be at the top of his game, but the body won't hold out forever unless you're Philip Rivers, apparently. So who is to say Stafford doesn't end up trapped at eighth?\n\nAnd for another fun fact, Rivers needs just 649 yards to surpass Ben Roethlisberger for sixth all-time on the list. So if Rivers does get rolling or comes back for another year, he might knock Big Ben down a rung on the ladder as well. And above Roethlisberger? Well, that's current Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who passed the former Steelers signal caller at the beginning of this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Can Philip Rivers fend off Matt Stafford on NFL career passing list?",

    "fullText": "Cardinals predicted to replace Kyler Murray, make bold trade in 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNot much has gone right for the Arizona Cardinals in 2025.\n\nThere was some optimism around the team this offseason, but the season has been a complete failure. Entering Week 15, the team is sitting at 3-10 and is buried at the bottom of the NFC West.\n\nQuarterback Kyler Murray has only played in five games this season, and it was recently revealed that he will not return in 2025. Is it possible we've seen the last of Murray in a Cardinals' uniform?\n\nPatrick K. Flowers of Bleacher Nation thinks so. Flowers published an updated mock draft, and he has the Cardinals making a bold move to replace Murray in the first round of the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nFlowers has the Cardinals trading up with the New York Giants for the No. 1 pick and selecting Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.\n\nRegarding the Mendoza selection, Flowers offered the following:\n\nThe Cardinals are going to move on from Kyler Murray. If they don’t trade up with the Giants (who seem intrigued enough in Jaxson Dart to pass on a QB), they’ll almost absolutely be shut out on the big three in the class.\n\nAs Flowers mentioned, it seems likely the Cardinals will move on from Murray. ESPN's Josh Weinfuss recently broke down that possibility, and explained that the Cardinals could save up to $42.5 million if they trade Murray after June 1.\n\nIt's not like the Cardinals were having much success with Murray, anyways. The quarterback went 2-3 as the starter this year and has not been to the playoffs since 2021.\n\nIn Mendoza, the Cardinals would be getting arguably the top quarterback prospect in the 2026 class. Mendoza is the heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy and he led the Hoosiers to a perfect record, Big 10 Championship, and a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\nIn 2025, his first season in Indiana, Mendoza has thrown for 2,980 yards with 33 touchdowns and six interceptions. Mendoza led the FBS in touchdown passes and led the Big 10 in yards per attempt.\n\nMendoza has an NFL arm and solid enough mobility to make some plays with his legs. He moves through his progressions nicely and is able to make throws in tight windows.\n\nIf the Cardinals move on from Murray, Mendoza could start immediately. Jacoby Brissett, who has looked serviceable in relief of Murray this season, is under contract for 2026, so he could be a perfect mentor to Mendoza.",

    "fullText": "Jeremiyah Love mock draft projection: Where will Notre Dame RB get picked in 2026 NFL Draft? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJeremiyah Love has put together two similar monster years as Notre Dame's top running back. His 2025 campaign earned him a trip to New York as a Heisman Trophy finalist.\n\nAfter amassing 2,497 rushing yards and scoring 35 touchdowns the past two seasons, averaging 6.9 yards per carry, Love has emerged as the clear best running back prospect for the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nHere's breaking down Love's talented skill set and how high he can go as a first-round pick when he's selected on April 23:\n\nMORE: The case for and against Jeremiyah Love for the Heisman\n\nLove (6-0, 214) is a well-built power back who also has great explosiveness to reel off long runs. His experience and consistency should make the St. Louis native have a smooth transition to the NFL\n\nLove is a complete back. He's got the power to run well through initial tackles and get tough chunks between the tackles. He's also got the breakaway speed to bounce any run to the outside or open field and go the distance with any touch. He is smart and reads his blocks well, showing exceptional balance, vision and patience. Although he wasn't used a lot as a receiver, he has the good hands to be a difference-maker in the passing game, extending from his rushing assets.\n\nLove might need to get a little stronger to hold up as the same type of power back in the NFL. Like most rookies coming into the NFL, pass blocking will become a greater emphasis to ensure he can stay on the field for three downs.\n\nMORE: College football bowl picks, predictions for CFP games\n\nAlvin Kamara is nearing the end at 31. The Saints have a lot of needs as a rebuilding team, but if they don't go defense or offensive line, Love would be a strong pick for offensive-minded Kellen Moore, who produced a career year out of Saquon Barkley in the Eagles' Super Bowl-winning run last season. Love's home-run attributes would add a needed fresh legs element.\n\nBetween Brian Robinson Jr., Austin Ekeler getting hurt and the team mashing up a committee of Chris Rodriguez Jr., Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Jeremy McNichols, the Commanders need to clean up their backfield and give Jayden Daniels a worthy, healthy young running mate. Adding Love would be much like the Lamar Jackson-Derrick Henry older duo that smashed for the nearby Ravens in 2024.\n\nThe Cardinals saw James Conner break down from his volume and backup Trey Benson also couldn't stay healthy, leaving an ineffective mixed fill-in bag of Bam Knight, Emari Demercado and Michael Carter. Conner will turn 31 in May and has plenty of wear. Love would be the ideal replacement to help whoever's the QB.\n\nMORE: Where Jeremiyah Love projects in SN's latest mock draft\n\nThe Jets may be trending toward moving on from Breece Hall, a pending free agent. Or they could try to keep Hall and draft someone for a dangerous 1-2 punch in the running game, given Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand saw first-hand the major effect of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs to revive the Lions' offense. Either way, bringing some Love to New York would be an option, given the Jets have two first-rounders.\n\nThe Vikings have seen Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason toggle between injury issues and getting a more reliable running game would be huge to take pressure off J.J. McCarthy or whoever their starting QB will be. Love can also provide an extra explosive element for Kevin O'Connell to better open up the passing game.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza wasn't expected to be the top quarterback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft. Following his surprise Heisman Trophy-caliber 2025 season at Indiana, however, now he will be taken high in the first round as the first QB off the board on April 23.\n\nWhy has Mendoza shot up draft boards for his play, and what's his pro outlook?\n\nHere's a profile of the Hoosiers passer, including what teams are most likely to draft him:\n\nMORE: The case for and against Fernando Mendoza for the Heisman\n\nMendoza (6-5, 225) has the ideal size as a strong pocket passer. The Cal transfer and Miami high school product was a hit in Curt Cignetti's dynamic offense. He's developed all the physical and mental qualities to be a top-10 pick for a QB-needy team.\n\nMendoza is very accurate with his short-to-intermediate passing. He is a good decision-maker who processes the field well. When he has a clean pocket, he can make all the throws. He also hangs tough in the pocket when facing pressure and is fearless in his execution. Mendoza is an aggressive thrower, but also avoids forcing the ball into coverage. He can zip it to take shots, but also adjust to show touch on passes when needed.\n\nMendoza can scramble for yardage when the defense breaks down and his big frame can help him on quarterback sneaks, but he won't add an element of plus athleticism to a team, as he's far less comfortable throwing on the run and won't provide any designed support for the running game. He will need to learn better how to dissect more complex pressure and coverage schemes in the NFL.\n\nMORE: College football bowl picks, predictions for CFP games\n\nWith the Giants (Jaxson Dart) and Titans (Cam Ward) taking first-round QBs in 2025, it's pretty clear where Mendoza might be headed. Here are the five teams to watch most to draft him\n\nWith Chip Kelly gone from the offense, Pete Carroll can look for a new OC with a pocket passer in mind to replace Geno Smith. It doesn't hurt that Mendoza's Big Ten clutch style would get a stamp of approval from part-owner Tom Brady.\n\nThe Browns will learn more about Shedeur Sanders for the rest of the 2025 season to see whether the rookie fifth-rounder deserves a more extended look to start in '26. If not, Cleveland would be firm play to try again at franchise QB.\n\nMORE: Where Fernando Mendoza projects in SN's latest mock draft\n\nWill the Saints see enough from Tyler Shough to make a call either way on the second-round rookie QB? If they want to go higher into the draft pool for offensive-minded Kellen Moore, Mendoza has the Dak Prescott-like pocket qualities to execute his offense well.\n\nAaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand saw the success of pocket-passing winning with Jared Goff (6-4, 217) in Detroit and may want to go that route to try again to strengthen the position for the long haul.\n\nThe Cardinals are heading to part ways with Kyler Murray and there might be some offensive coaching changes in store, too. Mendoza, Marvin Harrison Jr., Trey McBride and Michael Wilson would make for a good young passing game foundation.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "title": "Can a nepo baby be an underdog? The remarkable rise of Shedeur Sanders",
    "description": "The quarterback was seen as living off his father’s name when he entered the NFL. But he has slowly started to prove himself at the Cleveland Browns",
    "fullText": "It seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, the Cleveland Browns’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.\n\nHe excelled at two colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most dramatic stock crashes in league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.\n\nEarlier this week Sanders was named the Browns starter for the rest of the season, inviting even more scrutiny of a an already polarizing player. His supporters say Sanders is entitled to his shot; his critics say he lacks the skills to play in the NFL, question his attitude and paint him as a spoiled rich kid. Every argument seems to excavate deeper feelings about Deion Sanders, his Prime Time father who paved the way for his son’s success. In the age of the nepo baby, Shedeur makes for a strange underdog story.\n\nThere are expectations that come with being a starting quarterback in the NFL, after all. In addition to the requisite physical attributes and arm talent, the cliche dictates that quarterbacks are men of character – players who speak in the first person plural, deflect credit, absorb blame and lead with modesty. It’s how the quarterback position became shorthand for a standard of American leadership that was largely reserved for conservative white men until recently. But Shedeur doesn’t even resemble the Black quarterbacks who have in the last few years broken from that tradition and transformed the league. Instead, in character at least, he resembles his father. Deion is a flashy, brash and supremely self-confident two-sport superstar universally recognized as one of the best players in NFL history.\n\nAfter becoming the first Browns quarterback to win his first start since the team’s 1999 relaunch, a soundbite of Shedeur effectively congratulating himself for playing well despite his limited practice time overshadowed the more diplomatic remarks he’d make in praise of the team later. (“Imagine what a full offseason looks like,” he beamed. “It gets dangerous!”) When he was asked last Sunday if a botched two-point conversion attempt had worked during practice, he laughed. (“I don’t think you call plays in a game that didn’t work in practice,” he cracked.) After being criticized for his remarks in the media earlier this season, he was asked about the Browns’ quarterback situation. Sanders repeatedly answered by grinning and then silently moving his mouth in response – which had fans jokingly referring to him as Mime Time in a nod to his father.\n\n“We want our quarterbacks to be very, very humble,” says Louis Moore, the Michigan State history professor and author of The Great Black Hope: Doug Williams, Vince Evans, and the Making of the Black Quarterback. “He’s not that. He’s grown up believing that he’s allowed to have confidence in himself. The world beats down a lot of young Black kids, and Deion never let it happen.”\n\nThe biased nature of the scrutiny on Shedeur, especially when things don’t go his way, often results in fans bringing up racism. They further wonder whether Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski holds a grudge against the Sanders family because his father-in-law, Tim McCarver, had an infamous run-in with Deion during the latter’s baseball career.\n\nBut the issue isn’t quite so black and white. Somehow, the Sanders family manage to inspire Obama-level respect and enthusiasm among Black Americans (who helped make Shedeur’s Browns jersey a bestseller) while also having Donald Trump in their corner. The current president hasn’t hesitated to cannonball into the Shedeur Sanders discourse, calling NFL owners “stupid” for letting him fall in the draft and trumpeting “I TOLD YOU SO!” on social media after Shedeur led the Browns past the Raiders. Trump couldn’t let those moments pass without making some mention of Shedeur’s “exceptional genes” in what was otherwise a forceful show of support.\n\n“I’m just thankful for [Trump] even taking time out of his day to speak out,” said Shedeur, reveling in his nepo baby status. While Peyton Manning was determined to overshadow his father Archie’s fruitless years with the New Orleans Saints and Bronny James shrinks from the allusions to the more prominent Lakers player in his family, Shedeur has been happy to share a spotlight with his famous father for more than a decade.\n\nA good chunk of his adolescence was documented on Deion’s Family Playbook, a reality TV series that ran on Oprah’s cable channel. Shedeur then played under his father when Deion coached at Mississippi’s Jackson State University and the University of Colorado, and the pair were instrumental in reviving both of those programs. Wherever Shedeur goes, there’s usually a camera following him – and oftentimes his older brother Deion Sanders Jr, the architect of the family’s vast online media presence, is the one holding the camera. Around family, Shedeur reverts from a football star to a little brother who gets razzed about his fashion choices and his position on his father’s sibling power rankings.\n\nBeing Deion Sanders’s son made Shedeur savvy to how NFL storylines are shaped, and the one he’s crafted about himself strikes the media – who are used to taking charge of the narrative – as presumptuous. He calls himself “legendary”, shrugs off brickbats (“You think I’m worried about what critics say?”) and throws words like “destiny” around when projecting his career path. Resentments linger about his starry approach to the draft process that may well have cost him the chance to be picked higher. It was thought that Deion was the one quarterbacking things behind the scenes at this year’s draft, but he has since revealed that it was Shedeur who may have rebuffed higher draft opportunities in Philadelphia and Baltimore because he didn’t want to sit behind two established starters, Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson – a pretty smart read as it turns out.\n\n“I know the fight behind the fight,” Deion Sanders said earlier this season. “I know what’s been transpiring behind the curtains, and I’m just proud of him. Because he’s not just saying the right things, he’s doing and living the right things. That’s just who he is … He’s a Sanders.”\n\nShedeur has only played in four NFL games, two of those against bad teams, which is too small a sample size to make concrete pronouncements about his career. But his performances so far for the Browns, a team who have sunk the careers of countless quarterbacks, hint that he is dramatically better than his lowly draft position suggests. And while his chance to finish out the season is the first true vote of confidence he has received since joining the organization, there’s a sense that he isn’t so much playing for his Browns future as he is playing for the chance to thrive elsewhere. That’s because the Browns made a $230m commitment to the injured Deshaun Watson and are determined to see if they can get their money’s worth when he returns to fitness. With this season long lost, really all that Shedeur has to play for is trade value, pride and teammate Myles Garrett shattering the single-season sack record – but of course that’s the popular spin.\n\nFor Shedeur, it’s just the latest chapter in a story that ends with him going down as the one of the biggest underdog success stories in sports – the draft afterthought who became an NFL legend. (Sound familiar?) That dissonance of an underdog with privilege shows the extent to which nepo babies have taken over the narrative.",

    "description": "The Browns lost yet another one, and this time to the measly Titans. So, yeah, we have some thoughts.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns' 31-29 loss to the Tennessee Titans in Week 14 was a study in frustrating contradictions.\n\nOn one hand, the team showed flashes of a potentially bright future, particularly on the offensive side of the ball. Rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a statistical performance that should give the organization and its fans genuine hope for the future, leading the offense on a thrilling, if ultimately incomplete, fourth-quarter comeback attempt. His connection with fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. was explosive and dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the loss starkly illuminated the systemic flaws that have plagued the Browns throughout this disappointing season. The defense, usually a bedrock of strength, struggled significantly, particularly against the run game, allowing a career-day for Titans running back Tony Pollard. Furthermore, the persistent issues on the offensive line and costly mistakes, including a momentum-killing interception and two failed two-point conversions, proved to be the difference against a struggling Titans team.\n\nThis defeat, dropping the Browns to 3-10, was a painful reminder that potential, even when dazzling, is no substitute for consistency and flawless execution, especially when facing a team desperate for a win.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the snowy, frustrating afternoon at Huntington Bank Field.\n\nShedeur Sanders showed another significant step in his development on Sunday, logging the best statistical game by a rookie quarterback this year with 364 yards passing and three touchdowns, plus a rushing score.\n\n23/42, 364 pass yds, 3 pass td, 29 rush yds, 1 rush td, 1 int\n\nmore highlights on https://t.co/xMzvHOeNay pic.twitter.com/mfCA7cgkGc\n\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 8, 2025\n\nSanders showed up when the team called his number, orchestrating two late touchdown drives. However, the one play he definitely wants back is a costly third-quarter interception on what looked to be a scramble drill attempt, where he overshot his man, flipping the game's momentum.\n\nSanders is still holding onto the ball longer and more often than any other quarterback in the league, leading to unnecessary pressure, sacks, and backbreaking turnovers. But if his can be ironed out further and his internal clock can be sped up, the Browns might just have their future quarterback already at the helm, proving he can handle the NFL stage.\n\nThe rookie tight end out of Bowling Green, Harold Fannin Jr., continued his impressive run as a leading pass-catcher for the Browns.\n\nFannin racked up 114 yards and a touchdown on eight receptions against the Titans, marking a career-high for the young player and joining Ozzie Newsome as the only rookie tight ends in Browns history to record a 100-yard receiving game.\n\nHis blend of size, hands, and route-running ability makes him a matchup nightmare, and he is quickly solidifying his place as a core component of the Browns' offense for years to come. In an offense struggling for consistent playmakers, Fannin Jr.'s emergence is a major win.\n\nLinebacker Devin Bush has been lights out for Jim Schwartz's defense this season.\n\nAgainst the Titans, he added a key interception to his stat sheet, reading quarterback Cam Ward's eyes perfectly for a 44-yard return that set up a Browns scoring drive. Bush is playing like the dynamic, first-round pick the Steelers thought they were getting out of Michigan all those years ago.\n\nDevin Bush intercepts Cam Ward!\n\nTENvsCLE on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/adKxo8zSCL\n\nIn a league that values three-down linebackers, his strong, consistent performance this year, especially in coverage, has positioned him for a substantial contract in the upcoming free agency period.\n\nThe myth of the weather advantage was definitively debunked on Sunday. As the snow fell, the Titans' lead grew, largely due to the Browns' defense slipping and sliding all over the grass.\n\nThe conditions seemed to hamper Cleveland’s pursuit angles and tackling, leading to a career game from Titans running back Tony Pollard, who ran for 161 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nTony Pollard 65-yard TOUCHDOWN.\n\nTENvsCLE on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/UZ9c5ifvfN\n\nThe Titans' effective ground-and-pound strategy mitigated the Browns' fearsome pass rush, turning the supposed home-field edge into a distinct disadvantage for the defense.\n\nWhile Shedeur Sanders' tendency to hold onto the ball for a long time certainly allows for more pressure to be created, the offensive line is not without blame.\n\nThe unit's lack of consistency in play and availability has been a recurring and season-long problem, culminating in a performance where key starters suffered significant injuries. With starting center Ethan Pocic reportedly suffering a likely season-ending Achilles injury and other starters battling injuries, the unit is in shambles.\n\nThe team is likely looking to replace four of the five starters this offseason. A number that could be jumping to five of five if veteran left guard Joel Bitonio finally decides to hang up the cleats at season's end.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns vs. Titans: 5 takeaways from Cleveland's NFL Week 14 loss",

    "description": "The Bills are two games behind New England but favored to win.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are tied for the best record in the NFL. And yet, they're not even favored at home this week.\n\nAn oddsmaker's power ranking doesn't always match public perception or a team's record. The Buffalo Bills are very unlikely to win the AFC East but they are still the favorites to win the AFC. The Bills have the shortest odds to win the conference at +375. That belief in the Bills is reflected in this week's point spread.\n\nThe Bills, who lost to the Patriots at home back in Week 5 and are two games behind New England in the standings, are 1-point favorites at BetMGM vs. the Patriots on Sunday. That's an interesting line.\n\nThe Patriots have been slighted a bit for playing the easiest schedule in the NFL so far this season, but winning 10 games in a row is difficult no matter the opposition. And the Patriots do have good road wins at Buffalo and at Tampa Bay. The Bills have Josh Allen, but they haven't been great. They have bad blowout losses to the Falcons and Dolphins. Last week they were in danger of losing to the Bengals at home until Christian Benford had a magical pick-6 and turned the game around. You can pick holes in New England's season if you wish, but the same can be done to the Bills. On top of it all, the Patriots are well rested coming off their bye week.\n\nMaybe Josh Allen plays the superhero role and keeps the Bills' chances at an AFC East title alive (the Patriots clinch the division title with a win on Sunday) but we'll give some respect to the Patriots and make them the pick at +1. It seems like getting proper respect won't be easy for this Pats team.\n\nHere are the rest of the picks for Week 15 in the NFL, with odds from BetMGM:\n\nIt's hard to back either team. The Bucs are coming off a miserable loss to the Saints, and their offense is in a slump. More specifically, Baker Mayfield is in a slump. His rating the last four games is 65.2. On the other side, the Falcons have lost seven of eight, and the last two gams were a loss to the lowly Jets and a 28-point loss to the Seahawks. But, we have to pick one of them.\n\nThe Bengals beat the Ravens 32-14 on Thanksgiving, in Baltimore. Not much has changed since. The Ravens are showing, week after week, they're not very good. So why are they favored here? Theoretically the Ravens could suddenly emerge as the stellar team everyone though they would be this season, but we've been waiting for that for months and it hasn't happened.\n\nIt seemed last week like the Commanders had one good performance left in them this season, and it came two weeks ago in a crushing overtime loss to the Broncos. Last week's effort against the Vikings was startlingly bad. They might already have their luggage packed for the trip to Cancun. The Giants aren't great either but they are rested after a bye.\n\nThere will be a few instances this week of teams in look-ahead spots. It's not all that common in the NFL, but how will the Bears get up to face the Browns when they know the Packers are coming to town six days later? The Browns have a good defense and until the past couple weeks, the theme of the Bears season was having a bunch of close wins, mostly over bad teams.\n\nThe only reason to believe in the Chiefs laying this many points is the argument that they are in must-win mode. But they've been in must-win mode for weeks. It hasn't mattered. The Chiefs aren't as bad as their 6-7 record (they're No. 6 in DVOA, haters) but this line seems a point or two too high. Would it be that surprising to see the Chargers win straight up?\n\nThe Eagles look broken and the Raiders are the NFL's worst team. What fun. Geno Smith is unlikely to start this week for the Raiders, which actually might not be a bad thing. Still, I can't take the Raiders. If there was ever a get-right spot for the Eagles, this is it. If they struggle here, they're really in trouble.\n\nBrady Cook might get the start for the Jets because Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor are hurt. Cook is an undrafted rookie who threw for 11 touchdowns in 12 games last season at Missouri. He'd be operating in an offense that hasn't been good no matter who is playing at quarterback. Anything seems possible in this weird NFL season, but this is a bad spot for the Jets.\n\nThe problem with taking the Cardinals is it's hard to figure out how they score on the NFL's best defense. But it's not like the Texans offense is a scoring bonanza either. Last week we took the Cardinals, based on the fact that a large number of their losses have been close. It didn't work out last week. Let's try again.\n\nThe Broncos certainly aren't without flaws, but a 2.5-point home underdog? That's surprising. Both 11-2 teams are underdogs at home this week, which says a lot about the wide-open nature of the NFL this season. Another factor in backing Denver: The Packers play at Chicago in Week 16 for what practically amounts to the NFC North title game. It shouldn't surprise anyone if they have an eye on that game.\n\nThis one is an even more extreme look-ahead spot. The Rams play at Seattle four days after this game in a meeting that could determine the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The Rams are a veteran team with a great coach, but how could they not be thinking a little bit about that game? Also, the Lions have extra rest after playing on Thursday night, which is usually an edge. Even if the Rams play well, the Lions have a good enough offense to always be in play for a backdoor cover. Be careful if you're taking the Rams here.\n\nThe Panthers have had a really weird season, with multiple quality wins and some miserable losses. One of those losses came to the Saints, and it wasn't all that close with New Orleans thoroughly outplaying Carolina in a 17-7 game. How could we know which Panthers team will show up? We'll hope for the one that is fighting for a division title late in the season.\n\nThe Titans have actually covered the spread in four of their last five games. It's not a good team but one that is still playing hard. The 49ers should blast the Titans. But that's not how the NFL typically works.\n\nThe Colts have eight wins and it wasn't just because of Daniel Jones. It has been a pretty good team this season, despite a recent slide. Yes, it's scary to depend on 44-year-old Philip Rivers or whoever plays quarterback against one of the NFL's best defenses. It could get ugly. But as is said often in this space, double-digit underdogs usually look hopeless, and then they somehow cover.\n\nProof that it would take a court order for the networks to flex a Cowboys game out of prime time. It's time to test whether Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy is turning a corner. He looked good last week, but that came against a really bad Commanders defense. If he can go on the road and have another positive outing against a Cowboys defense that has been better since the Quinnen Williams trade, maybe the narrative surrounding him will start to change. But let's see it happen first.\n\nThis is a strangely interesting game. The Dolphins started 1-6 but have rallied and aren't dead in the playoff race at 6-7. The Steelers can have some awful games, but they lead the AFC North at 7-6. It's a test for that Dolphins hot streak, considering they've been mostly beating bad teams and doing it with Tua Tagovailoa producing very little.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets were blown out in Week 14, losing 34-10 to the Miami Dolphins in Week 14.\n\nTheir record stands at 3-10 with four games remaining. The real-time 2026 NFL draft order is becoming clearer every week.\n\nThe Jets are slated to possess two first-round picks in 2026, their own and the one originally belonging to the Indianapolis Colts, as a result of the Sauce Gardner blockbuster trade. New York entered the weekend with their own selection at No. 7 overall and it did not change following Sunday's results.\n\nFive 3-10 teams are currently scheduled to own picks 4-8, and head coach Aaron Glenn's squad has the second-best strength of schedule (.541) among that group.\n\nThe Jets stay at No. 7 in the draft order, per ⁦@tankathon⁩ pic.twitter.com/M3Sl1GqZk7\n\n— Brian Costello (@BrianCoz) December 8, 2025\n\nIn better news, the pick originally belonging to the Colts was slated for 23rd overall entering Week 14. Following the Colts' blowout loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, it has improved to No. 21. Starting quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles injury and Indianapolis fell to third place in the AFC South.\n\nThe Jets still don't own a top-five selection. If quarterbacks Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields aren't able to return following their Week 14 injuries, it's difficult to imagine the Jets winning a game with rookie undrafted QB Brady Cook in the lineup. We'll be monitoring the updated draft order every week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Where are the Jets' Round 1 picks after Week 14 loss?",

Players become eligible five years after ending their career and, in his first year of eligibility, Rivers has been named a semi-finalist for the class of 2026.\n\nIf he remains on the Colts' practice squad, he will maintain his eligibility, but if he is elevated to the active roster, he will not be eligible again until the class of 2031.",

After playing games in the German city in both 2022 and 2024, the NFL announced Wednesday it will return to Munich in both 2026 and 2028 for regular-season games.\n\nThe move is part of a multiyear partnership with both the city of Munich and FC Bayern Munich. Games will be hosted at Allianz Arena, where FC Bayern Munich plays its home games.\n\nThe NFL today announced it will return to Munich, Germany in 2026 and 2028 to play regular season games, as part of a multi-year partnership with the City of Munich and FC Bayern Munich.\n\nThe games will be played at the FC Bayern Munich Stadium.\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 10, 2025\n\nFC Bayern Munich confirmed the partnership, with the mayor of Munich, Verena Dietl, expressing excitement over \"spreading the enthusiasm\" for American football in the city.\n\n\"I’m delighted about the extension of our contract with the NFL and it once again shows the importance and strength of Munich as a sporting city. The previous games not only won the hearts of the fans, but also strengthened our successful cooperation with the NFL. Together, we’re committed to promoting American football in Germany and spreading the enthusiasm for the sport far beyond the stadiums. I'm looking forward to the upcoming games in 2026 and 2028, which will not only bring top-class sport, but also valuable impetus for grassroots sport in our city.\"\n\nThe NFL has played regular-season games in Munich two other times. The Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers played at Allianz Arena in 2022, with the Bucs coming out on top. Two years later, the Carolina Panthers beat the New York Giants in Munich.\n\nGermany is no stranger to hosting NFL games at this point. In addition to those two contests, the Indianapolis Colts and Atlanta Falcons played a regular season game in Berlin, Germany earlier this year. The Colts won thanks to a tremendous performance from running back Jonathan Taylor.\n\nThe NFL has not announced which teams will take part in the Munich game in 2026 or 2028.\n\nIn recent years, the NFL has pushed to expand play outside the United States. The league has scheduled a number of international games each year, with six taking place during the 2025 NFL season. The NFL has played at least one game in the United Kingdom regularly since the 2007 season and has expanded international play to Brazil, Spain and Mexico, among other countries, in recent seasons.\n\nThe 2026 Munich game marks one of six international games announced by the NFL for next season. In addition to playing in Germany next year, the NFL will also play in Australia, Brazil and Mexico. The league will also play two games in the United Kingdom in 2026.\n\nThe league announced the Los Angeles Rams will play in the Australia game and that the Jacksonville Jaguars will appear in one of the games in the United Kingdom, but have not revealed any other teams taking part in international games next season.",

    "description": "We’re back in the top 10 baybeee",
    "fullText": "As Week 15 approaches, we rounded up the latest NFL power rankings to get a sense of how the Jaguars are viewed nationally.\n\nTrevor Lawrence has taken major strides the past two weeks. It’s all starting to click in the new offense.\n\nThey played once at Levi’s Stadium this year. Could they be returning?\n\nMost shocking statistical ranking: Wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr . is 50th in receiving yards\n\nExpectations were pretty high for Thomas after a big rookie season — 1,282 yards (third in the NFL) and 10 TDs — but he has had issues catching the ball (five drops) and rookie Travis Hunter moved ahead of Thomas into the No. 1 receiver role by Week 7 before Hunter ‘s season-ending injury. Thomas did miss three games because of an ankle injury and has had five catches for 115 yards in the two games since his return. But the team now views Jakobi Meyers — whom they traded for on Nov. 4 — as its No. 1 wideout. Thomas has 535 receiving yards so far.\n\nThey’re holding steady at No. 9 − and now firmly atop the AFC South with fifth-year QB Trevor Lawrence playing his most efficient football of the season heading into the stretch drive.\n\nNothing about Jacksonville’s successful season has felt intentional, let alone sustainable, but I think that the Jaguars are turning the corner. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has finally found a good rhythm in the passing game, his receivers are catching the ball again, and the playoff picture is shaping up for the Jags to win a game or two this postseason.\n\nAfter saying all that, I’m positive that this team will repay my belief by embarrassing itself in the next couple of weeks.\n\nBeating the Colts was huge and probably wrapped up the AFC South for them. Still, it’s hard not to wonder how the game would’ve played out if Indy hadn’t lost QB Daniel Jones.\n\nIf you were to ask me to identify Jacksonville’s superpower, I’d probably stumble my way through an answer before mentioning the run defense. But once Daniel Jones was knocked out of Sunday’s game, the Jaguars flexed their muscles and put the Colts away to wrest temporary control of the division. The Texans are coming, but these Jaguars are making things work in Liam Coen’s first season. He might be running third in the Coach of the Year race behind Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson, but Coen’s offense looked nice early against Indy before slowing down after halftime. All in all, though, this team is playing good football at the right time. Jacksonville has allowed just 13 points per game over the past four, and it’s looking like the Jags could face undrafted rookie Brady Cook at QB when the Jets come to town this Sunday.\n\nThe Jaguars took control of the NFC South on Sunday, and there’s a good chance they secure their first division title since 2022 by winning three of their final four games.\n\nWith Daniel Jones injured for Indianapolis, the Denver Broncos are probably the only playoff-caliber challenge left on Jacksonville’s schedule. If the Jags don’t play down to the competition against the Colts, Jets and Titans, they’ll host a playoff game.\n\nHow Jacksonville actually fares in the postseason will hinge on Trevor Lawrence’s play and the defense’s ability to force turnovers. The Jaguars haven’t won the turnover battle and lost a game since Week 2.\n\nAs wrong as I was about how Ben Johnson’s demeanor was going to translate to leading an NFL locker room, I may have been equally wrong about Liam Coen. Just look at the immaculate vibes taking place here.\n\nSunday changed everything in the AFC South. The Colts lost Daniel Jones, and the Jaguars picked up a critical win. It’s hard to watch the Jaguars and Texans and believe Jacksonville is the better team right now (more on the Texans in a bit) but they do lead the division. The AFC South might come down to whether the Jaguars can beat the Broncos or the Texans can beat the Chargers, because the other remaining games for both teams are all winnable.\n\nFrom Josh Kendall and Chad Graff:\n\nThe Jaguars’ first-year coach is in a neck-and-neck race with the Bears’ Ben Johnson for the most performative postgame locker room speeches. After Jacksonville won for the fifth time in six games Sunday, Coen looked on the verge of breaking his players’ hands high-fiving. He has the players believing, though. Josh Hines-Allen was even talking about the Super Bowl after recording his seventh sack.\n\nThe Jaguars’ average rank this week is 9.6 (last week: 11.2).\n\nThe #Jaguars keep on climbing pic.twitter.com/mJqYwcOuw0\n\n— Duval 22 (@duval22dotcom) December 10, 2025\n\nWhere would you rank the team, Jaguars fans?

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals announced a practice squad addition and had a player from the practice squad depart. Cornerback Chigozie Anusiem, who had been on the practice squad since the start of the season, was signed by the Las Vegas Raiders to their active roster.\n\nThe Cardinals announced the signing of receiver Steven Sims, who had a tryout with the team on Monday.\n\nSims is 5-10 and 176 pounds. He has been in the NFL since 2019, playing for Washington, Pittsburgh, Houston and Baltimore. He has played in 53 games, starting six, and has 78 career receptions for 704 yards and five touchdowns. He also has averaged 25.2 yards on kick returns with a touchdown in his career.\n\nIt would not be a surprise to see him elevated this weekend to return kicks against the Houston Texans.\n\nWith Anusiem's departure, the Cardinals have 16 players on the practice squad. They have one vacancy. Here is the current makeup of the unit.\n\nDL Denzel Daxon (international exemption)\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

That would suggest it's a value.\n\nAnd if 44-year old Philip Rivers comes out with a mojo that only he can have, the Colts could win this game for sure.\n\nMORE: How the 6-7 meme sums up the Chiefs' season perfectly\n\nThe spread, in the ballpark of 13 or 14 points, is a tough one, too.\n\nYes, Seattle is playing great.

    "description": "Mendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also probably be a top candidate for a job in finance.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",
