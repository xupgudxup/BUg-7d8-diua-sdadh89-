    "fullText": "Every year, the football world shifts its attention to one of the most important checkpoints in the pre-draft calendar — the NFL Scouting Combine. Hosted in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium, the event marks the true beginning of draft season for front offices across the National Football League. It’s where film study meets measurable reality — where speed, explosiveness, strength, and movement skills are tested under a microscope. For prospects, it’s not just an evaluation; it’s a high-stakes job interview played out in front of coaches, executives, and scouts from every team.\n\nThis year’s spotlight centers on the players ranked at the top of Daniel Jeremiah’s latest top prospect board, a group loaded with elite athletic traits and immediate NFL potential. The list reflects the modern direction of the league — explosive edge defenders, versatile defensive backs, dynamic skill players, and quarterbacks capable of handling complex offensive systems. While game tape built their reputations, the combine will test how those traits translate in standardized drills and competitive environments. For some, it’s a chance to confirm elite status. For others, it’s an opportunity to rise dramatically with one standout performance.\n\nAs the drills begin and the testing numbers roll in, these top prospects enter the most revealing phase of their pre-draft journey. The combine won’t finalize their draft positions — but it will shape the conversation around them in a big way.\n\nMendoza carries himself like a true franchise quarterback, showing poise and command in high-pressure situations. His arm talent allows him to make layered throws with timing and precision, while his size helps him absorb contact and stay composed. He processes defenses quickly and rarely looks rushed mentally. Teams see a quarterback who can operate structure but still create when plays break down.\n\nLove is one of the most explosive offensive weapons in the class, capable of scoring from anywhere on the field. His acceleration through the hole and long-speed in open space make him a constant big-play threat. He runs with patience and vision, then flips a switch once he sees daylight. If his testing matches the tape, he’ll solidify elite playmaker status.\n\nBailey is a disruptive edge rusher with the power and burst to stress offensive tackles snap after snap. He plays with physical urgency, attacking the pocket and forcing quarterbacks off their spots. His length helps him control contact and win leverage battles at the line. Evaluators are especially intrigued by how much more upside he still has as his pass-rush toolbox develops.\n\nReese is an explosive athlete off the edge with range that shows up against both the run and pass. He closes space quickly and flashes the ability to wreck plays in the backfield. His pursuit motor stands out — he doesn’t quit on plays and consistently chases down ball carriers. With refinement, he has the traits of a high-impact defensive playmaker.\n\nStyles brings size, speed, and versatility that allow him to impact the game in multiple defensive roles. He moves fluidly in coverage but also plays with downhill force against the run. His physical profile makes him a matchup eraser against modern hybrid offenses. Coaches value defenders who can stay on the field in any situation — Styles fits that mold.\n\nBain is a relentless pass rusher who plays with power, urgency, and technical discipline. He consistently generates pressure by converting speed to strength and attacking leverage points. His intensity shows in how hard he plays every snap, especially in pursuit. He profiles as the type of defender offenses must account for in protection schemes.\n\nTate is a refined route runner who wins with timing, precision, and body control. He tracks the ball naturally and consistently positions himself to make difficult catches look routine. His game is built on reliability — quarterbacks can trust him to be exactly where he’s supposed to be. He projects as a dependable high-volume receiving target.\n\nDelane is a long, athletic corner with strong coverage instincts and physical press ability. He competes aggressively at the catch point and shows confidence challenging receivers downfield. His movement skills allow him to stay attached through routes and recover when needed. He has the traits teams look for in a boundary corner who can handle top matchups.\n\nDowns is a true playmaking safety with range, awareness, and sharp diagnostic skills. He reads offensive concepts quickly and arrives at the ball with decisive speed. Whether in coverage or run support, he consistently impacts plays with sound positioning. His instincts and football IQ make him one of the most complete defensive backs in the class.\n\nLemon is an electric playmaker whose acceleration and agility stand out immediately. He thrives after the catch, turning short receptions into explosive gains with quick cuts and burst. His ability to stretch the field vertically adds another dimension to his game. Offenses will value his versatility and big-play potential from multiple alignments.\n\nUltimately, this group represents the talent expected to define the early portion of the 2026 NFL Draft. The combine serves as both validation and opportunity — confirming what evaluators believe while opening the door for new storylines. From measurable dominance to unexpected breakout performances, this week helps transform top prospects into future professionals.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Top draft prospects ahead of the 2026 NFL scouting combine appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "NFL insider Ian Rapoport believes Green Bay Packers quarterback Malik Willis -- who is headed for unrestricted free agency as arguably the top available quarterback -- will eventually sign a deal worth $30 to 35 million per year.\n\n\"If Justin Fields gets $20 million a year, what does Malik Willis get? 30? 35? That's my guess as to what it is,\" Rapoport said on Gregg Rosenthal's \"NFL Daily\" podcast on Monday.\n\nRosenthal, who ranked Willis as his No. 1 free agent this offseason, estimated that the Packers backup quarterback will get a deal between $35 and 40 million, and Rapoport didn't disagree.\n\n\"I think that's probably right,\" Rapoport said.\n\nRapoport and Rosenthal discussed the possibility of Willis landing with the Miami Dolphins (Jeff Hafley and Jon-Eric Sullivan connection) and Arizona Cardinals (Matt and Mike LaFleur connection), but Rapoport wondered if the two teams could afford Willis given the money already committed to Tua Tagovailoa in Miami and Kyler Murray in Arizona.\n\nAt $30 million per year, Willis would slot in as a mid-tier starting quarterback. The top of the market at the position is over $50 million. There is a big gap between Fields, who signed a $20 million deal with the New York Jets last offseason, and the next tier, which features Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold and Geno Smith in the $30 million to $35 million range.\n\nWillis appears to be in position to easily beat the Fields deal and slot in somewhere in the Mayfield-Darnold-Smith range.\n\nAnd the Packers are looking more and more likely to get a third-round compensatory draft pick in 2027 when Willis signs his next deal.\n\nThe Packers acquired Willis, a 2022 third-round pick, for a seventh-round pick before the 2024 season. Over the last two seasons in Green Bay, Willis resurrected his career -- completing 70 of 89 passes for 972 yards, six touchdown passes and zero interceptions and rushing for 123 yards and two more scores over 11 games and three starts with the Packers.\n\nWillis got a showcase start in primetime against the Ravens in December, and he completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 60 yards and two more scores in a defeat.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: QB Malik Willis could get $30-35 million per year in free agency",

    "fullText": "Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic four-star quarterback Gunner Rivers is following in his father’s legendary footsteps.\n\nThe son of former NFL star and future Hall of Famer Philip Rivers has committed to NC State, choosing to join the Wolf Pack 26 years after his father did back in 2000. Gunner chose NC State over reported offers from Auburn, Georgia, Miami, Boston College and more.\n\nOne of the top quarterbacks nationally in the 2027 class, Rivers has long been thought of as a lean to the school where his father won ACC Player of the Year honors in 2003 and Rivers broke almost every NC State and ACC passing record.\n\nGunner himself has had a record-breaking high school career and is coming off a junior season where he completed 208 of 290 passes (72%) for 2,813 yards, 44 touchdowns and just five interceptions. In the process, he led St. Michael Catholic to a 13-1 record and an appearance in the state title game vs. powerhouse Jackson.\n\nStanding in at 6’3 and 200 pounds, he ranks as the nation’s No. 117 overall prospect and No. 12 quarterback, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, an equally weighted average that utilizes all three major recruiting services.\n\nHe also ranks as the No. 4 player from the state of Alabama this cycle.\n\nRivers is undoubtedly one of NC State’s biggest football recruiting wins in program history. His pledge gives head coach Dave Doeren and the Wolfpack four commits early on in the 2027 cycle.\n\nRivers joins Homerville (Ga.) Clinch County three-star safety Kamarion Johnson, Raleigh (N.C.) Cardinal Gibbons three-star tight end Griffin Cockerham and Southeast Raleigh three-star running back Christian Freeman.\n\nLast cycle, NC State signed the nation’s No. 46 class, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. It’s early, but the addition of Rivers could provide the Wolfpack with some serious recruiting momentum heading into the spring.\n\nNC State has not signed a top-25 class in the internet recruiting era. It’s highest-ranked haul came in the 2008 cycle, when it landed the No. 26 class that was headlined by four-star QB Mike Glennon.",

    "fullText": "The NFL Competition Committee has discussed a change to the league's rules that would allow replay officials throw penalty flags for fouls that went unpunished on the field.\n\nNFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said on Monday that the conversation centered on non-football acts that were unpenalized by on-field officials. Vincent cited Seahawks cornerback Josh Jobe striking Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs during Super Bowl LX and Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall stepping on Rams guard Kevin Dotson during the regular season as plays that could be addressed by the change. Jobe was fined for his act and Hall was suspended for one game, but neither was penalized during the game.\n\n\"You don't want to just be expanding the Pandora’s box, but we believe that things like the non-football act, you can really, really restrict what that is,\" Vincent said, via ESPN.com. \"That's something that we believe that potentially there's a little bit of tweaking in the language, that may be the first step.\"\n\nIf the league moves forward with this change, there will likely be more questions in the future about allowing replay officials to make calls on other clear penalties that are missed on the field.",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills announced that they have re-signed defensive tackle Phidarian Mathis. The former second-round pick agreed to a one year contract. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nStaying in Buffalo ‼️\n\nWe have re-signed OL Alec Anderson and DT Phidarian Mathis each to one year contracts.\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) February 23, 2026\n\nMathis, who will turn 28 in April, was chosen 47th overall by the Washington Commanders in the 2022 NFL Draft. He spent three injury-plagued seasons with the club, totaling just 25 tackles and two tackles for loss across only 23 games. Washington released him in December 2024, and he signed with the New York Jets’ practice squad. He did not appear in a game for Gang Green, and he was released in August 2025.\n\nMathis signed with Buffalo’s practice squad on September 10, 2025. The Bills elevated him for two contests—a 23-20 loss to the New England Patriots in Week Five and a 28-21 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week Eight—before signing him to their 53-man roster on November 5. Mathis played in four more games during the regular season, and in two of them, he was a huge contributor. He had four tackles in victories over the Cleveland Browns and the New York Jets. Overall, he showed good burst and solid anchor against the run, totaling 13 tackles in his six regular season games.\n\nMathis also played six snaps in the Bills’ Wild Card victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. At 6’4” and 312 lbs. with 34.5” arms, he profiles as someone who can play multiple spots along an odd-man defensive line, which is the scheme the Bills will utilize under new defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard. Coming out of Alabama, NFL Network’s Lance Zierlein called him a “scheme-versatile player” who could play nose tackle in either an odd front or an even front, or a 5-tech defensive end in a 3-4 scheme. Zierlein’s professional comparison for Mathis was DaQuan Jones, Buffalo’s top 1-tech defensive tackle for the last four seasons.\n\nNews had previously leaked regarding Buffalo re-signing offensive lineman Alec Anderson, and the Bills officially announced his signing in the same release announcing the Mathis contract.",

    "title": "What releasing Antonio Gibson means for the Patriots",
    "description": "The veteran running back was let go ahead of NFL free agency.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots decided to shake up their running back room on Monday. Antonio Gibson, who originally joined the team on a three-year, $11.25 million free agency deal in 2024, was released after two seasons and 22 total games with the organization.\n\nThe move itself did not come as too big a surprise. Not only was Gibson little more than a rotational option in the Patriots’ backfield with an unclear outlook given that Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson reside atop the depth chart, he also is currently rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in October.\n\nThat said, let’s take a bigger-picture view at what the transaction means from a New England perspective.\n\nThe Patriots entered the offseason with six true running backs under contract for the 2026 season, including Gibson as the projected RB3 behind the aforementioned Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. With him no longer a piece of the puzzle, one layer of depth has been removed behind the top pair and is leaving the group looking as follows:\n\nRunning back (5): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), Terrell Jennings (26), Lan Larison (34), Elijah Mitchell (45)\n\nOutside of those six players, the Patriots also have two backfield players headed for free agency. Both running back Deneric Prince and fullback Jack Westover are exclusive rights free agents.\n\nEven if Prince and Westover are retained, the Patriots are lacking established depth or long-term developmental upside behind Stevenson and Henderson. While they project as a formidable one-two punch, no Gibson as the third option means that the team might be on the lookout for another player with a similarly versatile skillset.\n\nBefore tearing his ACL in Week 5 against the Buffalo Bills, Gibson had not just served as the Patriots’ third running back but also their top kickoff return man. As such, he had averaged 28.5 yards on his 12 runbacks and also scored a 90-yard touchdown in Week 2 versus Miami.\n\nOnce Gibson was lost for the year, the Patriots were unable to find similar production and home-run potential. Six other players returned kickoffs for them on the year — running backs Rhamondre Stevenson, TreVeyon Henderson, Terrell Jennings and D’Ernest Johnson as well as wide receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III — but none emerged as a clear featured option.\n\nWith Gibson now officially out of the picture, the competition will start at zero again. Based on flashes, Henderson and Williams seem like the frontrunners at the moment, but there are a lot of factors plus future roster changes that are likely to change that projection.\n\nOne of the reasons why Gibson getting released was no surprise was his contract. Carrying a $4.14 million salary cap number, he was the 21st most-expensive player on the team right now. That in itself might not have been a release-worthy problem, but the structure of the pact invited a change: only his $1 million signing bonus proration for the 2026 season was fully-guaranteed.\n\nThat $1 million will now be added to the Patriots’ dead cap space for 2026. Meanwhile, the team created $2.14 million in net savings: his gross savings of $3.14 million minus another player with a $1 million salary cap number taking his spot on the Top 51 list of contracts to be counted against the cap once the new league year starts in mid-March.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, Gibson’s release now puts the Patriots $44.3 million under a projected league cap of $304.3 million.\n\nConsidering that Gibson was released with a failed physical designation, however, it appears that he qualifies for the NFL’s injury protection benefit. If so and he remains unsigned heading into the new season, the Patriots might be charged $2.1 million against their cap at the start of the regular season. In that case, the financial gains of releasing the 27-year-old would be minimal.\n\nThe Patriots’ 2024 offseason was their first without Bill Belichick presiding over their football operations. So, who was the first free agent added under the new regime led by Eliot Wolf and then-head coach Jerod Mayo? That would be one Mr. Antonio Gibson.\n\nWith Gibson now gone, so is another remnant of the Mayo-era Patriots. In fact, less than 14 months after his firing, only 23 players remain with the team who played under the one-and-done coach as pointed out by Ethan. Hurwitz of Sports Illustrated.\n\nWith Antonio Gibson's release, here's the list of remaining Patriots under contract for 2026 that played under Jerod Mayo:\n\n– Christian Gonzalez\n– DeMario Douglas\n– Kayshon Boutte\n– Drake Maye\n– Marte Mapu\n– Bryce Baringer\n– Dell Pettus\n– Marcus Jones\n– Terrell Jennings\n-…\n\n— Ethan Hurwitz (@HurwitzSports) February 23, 2026\n\nWhile his failed physical might have forced their hand a bit, the Patriots had no real reason to release Gibson now as opposed to closer to the start of free agency on March 11. However, with the entire league embarking on Indianapolis this week for the NFL Scouting Combine, getting cut now allows Gibson a head start of sorts.\n\nSure, teams will be cautious when it comes to a running back who tore his ACL just four months ago, but Gibson’s name is at least out there already and he can start taking visits and undergoing physical examination with other clubs right away. Other veteran running backs who might end up competing against him on the open market might not be in that same position yet.",

    "title": "NFL draft expert: There isn't a 'wrong answer' for Saints in Round 1",
    "description": "The Saints are in prime position at eighth overall. NFL draft expert Daniel Jeremiah says 'I don't know that there's a wrong answer' for New Orleans.",
    "fullText": "Whoever they pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, the New Orleans Saints have a great opportunity to make life easier for Tyler Shough. The second-year quarterback impressed across nine starts as a rookie but the team still owns a top-10 pick. Some great prospects are expected to be available when they go on the clock at eighth overall. NFL Media draft expert Daniel Jeremiah linked the Saints to Notre Dame star running back Jeremiyah Love in his first mock draft. He had them going with playmaking USC wideout Makai Lemon in his second projection.\n\n\"That would be a great decision to have if you have a guy like Makai Lemon there and then Jeremiyah Love,\" Jeremiah said on a pre-combine conference call. \"So I wanted to see what it would look like there and try and find a compliment to Chris Olave. I think (Lemon) would catch a bazillion balls in that offense from that quarterback with Kellen calling plays. ... So that was, you know, that was kind of looking at a different option there. I don't know that there's a wrong answer.\"\n\nWhat is it about these two prospects that is so appealing? Lemon has been surging to the forefront of Saints mock drafts in recent weeks, and for his part, Jeremiah is a big fan: \"Think (Moore) would know exactly how to use Makai Lemon and he'll give you easy completions for a young quarterback. He can work in the middle of the field. He's tough. He can help you out if you need him to dig out a linebacker in the run game as well.\"\n\nBut if he likes Love so much, why did Jeremiah pivot from the running back to the wide receiver? He explained: \"There is something to, okay, when the team is ready to really take off, then you drop in the running back. You utilize all of his carries. They all matter and they're helping you, you know, get in the playoffs and chase the championship. I think there's some other pieces to fill before you say that, you know, rocket's ready to take off there in New Orleans. So I kind of like the idea of letting Makai Lemon grow with a young quarterback and they can play together for seven, ten years or so. I just thought that would be a fun fit.\"\n\nWhether they go with a receiver or a rusher, the goal is the same -- get another weapon for Shough to lean on. Depending on the team's moves in free agency (bolstering the offensive line and signing other pass-catchers, or another running back) they could be set up to comfortably take Love and chase a playoff berth in the weak NFC South. Alvin Kamara isn't getting younger and he's playing in the last year of their contract. No team has had a less explosive run game over the last five years than New Orleans. Lemon could be a fun compliment to Olave, but at some point the Saints must inject real game-changing talent to their backfield. Maybe they'll find a way to do that before the draft gets here in late April.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Daniel Jeremiah: Saints don't have a 'wrong answer' in 2026 NFL Draft",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals have a big decision to make this offseason, as Trey Hendrickson's future with the team is in question.\n\nHe's set to be a free agent, but the Bengals could try to extend him, franchise tag him, or even trade him as opposed to simply letting him walk. For now, the Bengals have some time to make a decision.\n\nAnd with the NFL Scouting Combine getting underway, the Bengals might be getting a good idea of what they'll do this offseason. Paul Dehner Jr. of The Athletic notes that the Bengals might be able to gauge interest in Hendrickson at the Combine this week.\n\n\"The team is open to all options,\" Dehner writes, \"but how likely executing a trade would be based on his market and cooperation from Hendrickson's agent can be determined in Indianapolis.\"\n\nThe Bengals moving on from Hendrickson in a tag-and-trade is the most ideal path forward for Cincinnati this offseason.\n\nLetting him walk doesn't guarantee the compensatory pick hits, and even if it does, it might not be a third-rounder that the Bengals are looking for.\n\nIn a perfect world, the Bengals tag-and-trade Hendrickson this offseason, landing guaranteed value for their All-Pro pass rusher.\n\nMore: Why Bengals should prioritize Joe Flacco over Trey Hendrickson in free agency\n\nAt the NFL Combine, the Bengals will be able to gauge interest in Hendrickson from interested teams showing up to watch the top prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThis will be a big chance for the Bengals to figure out what their best path forward with Hendrickson will be. If they get interest from teams, executing a tag-and-trade with Hendrickson could be in the cards.\n\nFans should keep an eye out for any rumors with Hendrickson at the NFL Scouting Combine.

    "fullText": "While the Cincinnati Bengals are hard at work at the NFL’s scouting combine this week, there won’t be much that quiets the idea they have one prospect at the very top of their big board.\n\nThe Ohio State safety is an elite prospect who would be a dream fit for a Bengals team that has been stumbling at the position since letting Jessie Bates walk.\n\nOne problem…there’s a top-five team that sounds more than ready to make Downs the pick.\n\nNew York Giants head coach John Harbaugh told reporters recently that Downs is certainly someone they will consider at fifth overall, according to Josh Alper of PFT:\n\n\"We favor Hall of Fame safeties, so if we have a chance to draft a potential future Hall of Fame safety in Caleb Downs, that would be just fine with me. We'll take the best player. When you draft that high, you take the best player. It's not a need pick, it's a best player pick because you're going for the guy that's going to be that kind of player. You're talking about a player that you would like to see someday wearing a gold jacket if possible.\"\n\nOne could get cynical and say this is just Harbaugh trying to coachspeak and not give anything away to other teams about the draft strategy in New York.\n\nBut by now, everyone knows better. Downs isn’t a secret as an elite prospect. And rangy safeties who can play deep and anywhere else on the field are a must-have thing.\n\nIt’s too bad, then, the Bengals failed to realize it before fumbling the one they had.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bengals Wire: Will Bengals’ top NFL draft target make it out of Top 5?",

    "fullText": "Since 2020, the Indianapolis Colts have been one of the least active teams in NFL free agency.\n\nJason Fitzgerald of Over the Cap recently ranked each team by how much they've spent in free agency between 2020 and 2025 and how many free agents they've signed.\n\nA few caveats to note as Fitzgerald put together this list were that only free agent signings in the months of March and April counted, and the deal had to be for at least $2 million. This data also only included new additions and not any re-signings.\n\nDuring that span, the Colts' 15 free agent additions that qualify for this list are tied for the sixth-fewest in the NFL. Indianapolis is also the eighth-lowest spender in average free agent dollars each offseason at $125.98 million.\n\nHowever, when GM Chris Ballard has made signings, he has spent big, with the Colts average contract per player ranking near the top of the league at $8.39 million.\n\nOverall, the Colts are ranked 27th in Fitzgerald's rankings.\n\n\"We like our guys,\" is a familiar phrase that Ballard has said over the years, which is, in part, why the Colts rank near the bottom of this free agency spending list.\n\nLast offseason, however, we saw a more aggressive approach. This included signing Daniel Jones and spending fairly big on Charvarius Ward and Cam Bynum.\n\nBallard seemingly acknowledged that continuing down that path was going to be the plan this offseason.\n\nThe Colts are positioned relatively well from a salary cap standpoint to do so as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: NFL free agency: Where do Colts rank in free agent spending since 2020?",

Bitonio can spearhead the offensive line’s transition to a Mike McDaniel system—Bitonio was drafted during McDaniel’s season as the Browns’ receivers coach—and could be a critical, dependable asset amid constant injury woes.\n\nBitonio is not getting any younger, set to be 35 this season and is considering retirement, but he is durable and is still moving as if he were ten years younger.\n\nA stalwart presence along the Browns' offensive line for the past decade, Bitonio finished the 2025 season ranked as PFF's 8th-best pass-blocking guard. He has also ranked in the 91st percentile in PFF run-blocking grade over the past three seasons.\n\nOffensive coordinator Mike McDaniel was on the Browns' staff as the wide receiver coach in 2014, Bitonio's first season in Cleveland, so the familiarity is there.

    "description": "Tyreek Hill next team odds. Chiefs drawing shortest NFL odds to land All-Pro wide receiver after release from Dolphins.",
    "fullText": "Want to get more Covers content? Add us as a preferred source on your Google account here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins released wide receiver Tyreek Hill on Monday, February 16, finally ending a union that seemed destined for a breakup sooner rather than later.\n\nThe eight-time Pro-Bowler played in just four games in 2025 before suffering a season-ending ACL injury. What began as a perfect match, and briefly looked like the best offense in football alongside Jayden Waddle as Tua Tagovailoa's primary weapons, Hill's time in Miami appeared to sour by the end of 2024.\n\nNow, the hapless Dolphins and the 31-year-old receiver are embarking on different paths. Below, we'll look at the latest NFL odds for Hill's next destination — and why a reunion with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs feels inevitable.\n\nFrom 2016-21, Tyreek Hill was a mainstay in the Kansas City Chiefs offense, racking up 6,630 receiving yards and 56 touchdowns over 91 games. He made the Pro Bowl every season in Kansas City and was one of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' favorite targets.\n\nA reunion would make a ton of sense, especially after the Chiefs just missed the postseason for the first time since before either Hill or Mahomes debuted. The Chiefs struggled to establish a deep-ball threat this season, and an ancient Travis Kelce led the team in receiving.\n\nBringing Hill back into the fold immediately gives Mahomes an established weapon who, if he's 100%, can burn defensive backs better than almost anyone. And their familiarity should help him, figuratively and literally, hit the ground running in September and beyond.\n\nWhile the Chiefs are the logical landing spot based on \"narrative,\" the Buffalo Bills need a big-time receiver just as much. Quarterback Josh Allen relied more heavily on his tight ends in 2025, and giving him another option alongside top WR Khalil Shakir (who led the team with 72 receptions, while Dalton Kincaid was next with 39) would solve a glaring issue and take some of the pressure off.\n\nThe Bills' window isn't closed, but they did move on from head coach Sean McDermott this offseason, showing a desperation to get over the hump from \"great regular season team\" to \"legitimate Super Bowl contender.\" Hill would be a major upgrade.\n\nFresh off a disappointing showing in the Super Bowl, could the New England Patriots target Hill? Stefon Diggs is a $26.5-million cap hit next season, and is already being bandied about as a potential cut candidate.\n\nIt's doubtful that the Pats would employ both Diggs and Hill for a variety of reasons — both have had character and legal issues in recent years — and it may not make a lot of sense to replace Diggs with Hill, especially if the latter has questions about his health in the wake of his ACL tear and dislocated knee.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens committed to quarterback Lamar Jackson in moving on from head coach John Harbaugh, and bolstering the wide receiver corps may be a way to kickstart a new era.\n\nHe would help form a formidable duo with Zay Flowers, who had nearly 800 more receiving yards than his closest teammate in 2025. Veteran DeAndre Hopkins is a free agent, and Hill would be a significant upgrade at their respective points in their careers.\n\nFinally, this is an interesting option after Hill's former Miami Dolphins head coach, Mike McDaniel, was hired to serve as Jim Harbaugh's offensive coordinator. When Miami's offense was at its best before Tua Tagovailoa's concussions, the Dolphins looked virtually unstoppable.\n\nAssuming there's no bad blood, giving Justin Herbert a target of this caliber may unlock another level for the Los Angeles Chargers quarterback.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here and view our best betting sites or check out our top sportsbook promos.",

    "fullText": "It is another mock draft weekend. Every weekend until the actual 2026 NFL draft, we will run simulations for the Arizona Cardinals. Because compensatory picks have not been announced yet, exact Day 3 picks are still uncertain, so this mock draft simulation is only three rounds.\n\nIn this mock draft, using Pro Football Network's simulator, the idea was to try and make it match with what NFL.com draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah said about the Cardinals. They could be in the mix for an edge rusher, and quarterback Ty Simpson would make sense in the second round.\n\nThe Simpson pick didn't happen, though.\n\nHere are the results of the three-round mock draft.\n\nThe Cardinals have not drafted a player outside the Big Ten or SEC in the first two rounds of the draft in three drafts under general manager Monti Ossenfort. Bailey can be the exception. OhiO State's Arvell Reese is on the board, and he woudl fit the profile, but Bailey is a standard, true edge rusher, and the Cardinals simply need help there. Josh Sweat had 12 sacks, and no one else made any sort of impact, and Sweat made no impact on any fourth quarter.\n\nBailey will make Sweat better, and Sweat's presence will be great for Bailey.\n\nWe go back to the SEC. The Cardinals need a right tackle, and Proctor is a monster at 6-6, 369 pounds.\n\nHe fills that void in a large way.\n\nWhy couldn't it be Alabama QB Ty Simpson? He was drafted 15th in this simulation.\n\nAnother cornerback? Well, yes, because the Cardinals' corners can't stay healthy. Neal would pair nicely with Will Johnson with both of their size. Johnson is 6-2. So is Neal.\n\nSo the Cardinals add defensive help and get a bookend tackle. That's not a bad result.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "Let's run through some possible trade scenarios.",
    "fullText": "As the 2026 NFL offseason nears, it's worth looking at some possible trade scenarios for some of the league's top players. Who might get dealt around March's kickoff to the new NFL year?\n\nIn a first of three parts, we've imagined some possible NFL trades featuring some of the biggest names in the league. Don't worry; we hit the ground running with some real blockbusters involving elite talent.\n\nWe'll have 10 more trade ideas coming your way in the time to come, but it'll be good to get started off on the right foot. Who might wind up elsewhere? What would the trade packages look like? Inquire within!\n\nWill Crosby actually be dealt? Your guess is as good as mine, but Mike Vrabel has to be banging the tables to bring in the ace pass-rusher. The Patriots defense having that kind of edge rusher to wreak havoc would go such a long way to complement the tight secondary coverage. While Crosby can't protect Drake Maye's blindside, he'd make the quarterback's life easier by adding more balance to the other side of the ball. If the Patriots can improve their pass-rush with Crosby, they'll be better than they were in 2025. It'd be a slam-dunk to bolster a Super Bowl contender into a new league altogether on defense. In return, the Raiders could get a nice package of picks and a solid addition to the edge room in Anfernee Jennings to at least take a little of the bite out of trading away Crosby.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Crosby to New England for a 2026 first-round pick, a 2027 second-round pick and Jennings\n\nThe Titans desperately need to get quarterback Cam Ward a field-stretching wide receiver to take his game to the next level. Tennessee, flushed with cap space, could make Moore an integral part of the Titans' passing game without sending away too much draft compensation. With wide receiver Calvin Ridley a very possible cut candidate, the Titans could really use a veteran in the room like Moore. Ward being able to air it out a bit more would be huge for his development; Moore could also use a fresh start after getting a decrease in targets with Ben Johnson. Let's say the Titans send a third-round pick back to Chicago to get this done; that feels reasonable for both sides.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Moore to Tennessee for a 2026 third-round pick\n\nThe Vikings desperately need to undo the Sam Darnold decision. Watching Darnold win a Super Bowl with Seattle has to burn like the heat of a thousand suns for Minnesota fans who watched J.J. McCarthy struggle in his first full year as a starter. McCarthy's future already feels in flux as a Viking, and Minnesota's contention window may not support his clear need for more development. Enter Mac Jones. The 49ers can sleep easy with Jones as their backup to Brock Purdy, but could Minnesota pry Jones away by throwing McCarthy into the trade package? Perhaps Kyle Shanahan would be intrigued by the idea of developing McCarthy behind Purdy as a more long-term insurance plan. Jones proved in 2025 that he could be a decent starter in the right system. Swapping out Shanahan for Kevin O'Connell could keep the positive streak going for the former Patriots first-round pick. McCarthy could step back into the shadows to develop under Shanahan's watch, and Jones could start for a playoff-ready roster. Win-win?\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Jones to Minnesota for McCarthy, a 2026 sixth-round pick and a 2027 conditional third-round pick\n\nBrown's time with Philadelphia feels tenuous at best. The incredibly talented wideout helped bring a Super Bowl to the City of Brotherly Love, but an uneven 2025 campaign leans toward both sides needing a clean break. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman won't trade Brown for nothing, but we think it's very possible he's sent elsewhere. Where would he go? How about Las Vegas? Presumed Raiders rookie quarterback Fernando Mendoza will need a strong infrastructure to grow with, and Brown could instantly solve the team's wide receiver woes. A trio of Brown, tight end Brock Bowers and running back Ashton Jeanty could skyrocket Mendoza's development and give new coach Klint Kubiak plenty to work with in his first year as a head coach. Let's say a package of draft picks and a potential Dallas Goedert replacement convinces Roseman to trade Brown before the league year gets going.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Brown and a 2027 seventh-round pick to Las Vegas for a 2026 second-round pick, a 2027 fifth-round pick and tight end Michael Mayer\n\nThomas still has sky-high potential in the NFL, even if his future with the Jacksonville Jaguars is in flux. He's only TK and has so much football ahead of him. If he hits with the right team, the payoff could be enormous for both sides... and Thomas is still on a rookie deal. Jacksonville could probably get a really nice return on Thomas, too. Where might he go? How about the Commanders? Washington desperately needs more pop in the passing game to keep quarterback Jayden Daniels from scrambling too much. The team's soaring 2024 crashed and burned in 2025, so a rebound will be vital for all parties to keep their seats from getting hot. Thomas could replace Deebo Samuel as wide out Terry McLaurin's running mate and give Washington a potentially lethal deep threat for Daniels. Jacksonville could get a good draft pick and a young wideout from Washington in return and send Thomas to the NFC.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Thomas to Washington for a conditional 2027 second-round pick and WR Jaylin Lane\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL 2026 trade scenarios, Part 1: Who deals for Maxx Crosby?!",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk’s supposed interest in buying the Seattle Seahawks has been trending on social media.\n\nThe speculation gained traction after a viral post claimed the billionaire was interested in purchasing the NFL franchise from the Estate of Paul G. Allen.\n\nHowever, the real story centres on the Seahawks’ formal sale process rather than unverified fan conjecture.\n\nIn a post widely shared across platforms, as posted by TheNFLDrop, it was claimed, “Elon Musk says he is interested in purchasing the Seattle Seahawks from the Estate of Paul G. Allen.\n\n“Musk has a net worth of $850 billion, and the Seahawks are looking to sell for over $10 billion.”\n\nThat post mixed true elements, namely that the Seahawks are entering the market, with speculation about Musk’s intentions that is not supported by credible reporting.\n\nNo major sports news outlet has confirmed Musk is in advanced talks or formally pursuing the franchise. Ideas about Musk as a suitor remain fan discussion rather than a verified fact.\n\nIt is also worth noting that reported net worth figures for individuals like Musk often vary significantly over time and are routinely updated by financial outlets, not fixed figures reported by NFL sources.\n\nWhat is verified is that the Seattle Seahawks are being put up for sale by the Paul G.

    "title": "NFL combine is awash with questions about veterans, not rookies. They range from Lamar Jackson to Maxx Crosby",
    "description": "While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won't eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.",
    "fullText": "Maybe it’s the quarterback chaos or the landslide of head coaching changes. Or because it’s late February and many of the NFL’s personnel departments already seem satisfied that the No. 1 overall pick in the draft is in the barn. Or maybe it’s because the 2025 season produced a wildly unexpected Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, and an even more unexpected Super Bowl quarterback winner in Sam Darnold.\n\nWhatever the driving force, it’s thrusting the usual sideshow of the NFL scouting combine — trade rumors, free-agency buzz and clandestine general manager meetings — into the middle of the main stage. And with that, the college players who are taking their next big step toward draft positioning have become a subplot.\n\n“It’s going to be a wild offseason and it’s going to start next week [at the combine],” one prominent NFL agent said this week. “There’s so much more than usual with different veteran stuff compared to how guys are going to work out — and we have a good class of guys [in the draft]. All the quarterback things to figure out, some of the [veteran] defensive players — some of the young players that could be traded with the staff changes — there’s going to be a lot going on. …\n\n“I see you guys talking about storylines — when was the last time anyone checked in on what’s going on with Lamar Jackson [and the Baltimore Ravens]? It’s like that situation has gotten lost in all this noise. That’s how crazy next week is going to be, though.”\n\nIn fairness, Jackson’s potential extension deadline — spoken into existence by Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti in January — has been a prominent story over the past month. Indeed, it will crank up next week, with the quarterback and franchise having been in a contract talks window for several weeks by the time Ravens new head coach Jesse Minter and general manager Eric DeCosta meet with the media in Indianapolis. It’s expected there will be some kind of temperature gauge coming out of the combine, with the front office and ownership wanting to sign an extension with Jackson and lower his $74.5 million salary cap hit in 2026.\n\nOf course, Jackson is only one of multiple pressing maneuvers — or non-maneuvers — heading into the combine that will certainly drain some of the daily news thunder from draft prospects’ workouts. Among the prominent:\n\nWho will be getting the franchise tag applied to them before free agency, with the biggest potential name being Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. As it stands, Dallas is expected to tag Pickens prior to the March 3 deadline and then either attempt to retain him or try to engage in a sign-and-trade scenario. With Pickens wanting to get to free agency and a likely $35 million average salary per season, there will likely be sparks in a tag scenario.\n\nPotential veteran trades, including Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby, Philadelphia Eagles wideout A.J. Brown, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray and others. Throw in some young players who might get a call or two just to see if they are available on the trade market, including Buffalo Bills wideout Keon Coleman, Jacksonville Jaguars wideout Brian Thomas Jr., Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson and Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy.\n\nThe future of Aaron Rodgers will be a pressing question for the Pittsburgh Steelers — at least as it pertains to the organization’s other options and what kind of timeline there would be for a Rodgers decision. It’s possible we exit the combine under the presumption that the Steelers are going to move forward and try to find their future QB, which would shift the Rodgers conversation back to the Vikings, whom he was interested in before landing in Pittsburgh last offseason.\n\nAnd finally, one very big nugget that has yet to be developed: How much interest there will be in Malik Willis in free agency and what the money could ultimately look like. The ballpark speculation in the agent community is some kind of two-year deal averaging $30 to $35 million a season with $40 to $45 million guaranteed. That would put Willis in position to go back to the table next offseason and negotiate a longer term deal that tacks on to the end of 2027 and extends his guaranteed money out into a three-year window through the 2028 season. There are varying opinions on the numbers and structure, not to mention the potential interest. Willis feels like the first big quarterback domino that has to fall in March to trigger a larger migration. If he were to land in Pittsburgh, that then puts Rodgers — if he still wants to play — onto the market for the Vikings or any other suitors. And once Willis is off the board, the teams that ultimately don’t have him as an option will then have to reassess.\n\nThere’s a sliding scale of a trade likelihood for all these players. Crosby’s situation with the Raiders, from what Yahoo Sports has been told by league sources familiar with their talks, is still at a standstill — but also not unrepairable. Part of the Raiders’ motivation is to see what Crosby’s trade market looks like and also where he is at with the franchise in a new phase of a rebuild. The market will likely be the driving force here. If there is a solid offer of draft picks on the table, a trade seems more likely than not.\n\nThe same goes for Brown and the Eagles, although it remains to be seen what general manager Howie Roseman could engineer to fill his No. 1 wide receiver spot if there is ultimately an attractive offer available for Brown. It’s highly unlikely the Eagles would move Brown and not have another player in the mix, so the combine’s wide receiver workouts and other available players at the position could factor.\n\nThe Murray and Tagovailoa process is going to depend on suitors and money. Right now there are zero indications of an appetite to take on either Tagovailoa or Murray’s remaining contract in a trade, let alone surrender any meaningful draft assets to make him a starter. That could change if the QB shuffling doesn’t break right for some teams and desperation enters the scenario. Lest anyone forget, there was a market (albeit diminishing) for Russell Wilson the past two offseasons. So there can certainly be a market for Tagovailoa or Murray if a situation gets bad enough.\n\nAs for the young players, Coleman seems likeliest to be traded, given the comments of Bills owner Terry Pegula that essentially branded him as not being the front office’s draft choice. Unfortunately for Buffalo, Coleman’s trade value will be nothing more than a late pick at this stage. Even with his youth.\n\nThomas, Richardson and McCarthy are not expected to be officially on the trade block, but all three could garner some interest and calls. Thomas seems less likely to be dealt with the Jaguars moving Travis Hunter primarily to cornerback. McCarthy won’t be dealt unless the Vikings are presented with a quarterback option that effectively renders any chance of him having a future as moot. And Richardson doesn’t have much of a market, and will have only one year left on his rookie deal once his fifth-year option is ultimately declined. That doesn’t leave much room to develop him for any interested franchise. But again, we don’t know how desperate the quarterback field gets.\n\nThat’s a lot of veteran questions and potential developments that will hang over the primary reason teams are in Indianapolis next week: To begin laying down the foundations of their draft boards for April’s selection process in Pittsburgh. While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won’t eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.\n\nHere’s a look at some of those that will be worthy of watching.\n\nWhile it’s not expected to be as top-heavy as the 2024 wide receiver class — which saw seven first-round picks at the position — the wideouts are considered a spot that is going to have depth and offer needy teams quality options potentially into the third round. The general consensus at this point is that four to five receivers could go in the first round. Most of the intrigue will be how the top of the class sorts itself between the trio of Ohio State’s Carnell Tate, Arizona State’s Jordyn Tyson and USC’s Makai Lemon.\n\n“I think you could see some [changes in that trio] between interviews, measurements and whatever work gets done,” one NFC talent evaluator said. “The medicals, too — definitely the medical for Tyson. … And it depends how you want to use them in your scheme. Lemon, some teams might not like the size but others might love the versatility and how he catches it. How fast will Tyson run and some of the speed and agility things with Tate will be important. They’re all good players, but there’s definitely some of the [Travis] Hunter, [Tetairoa] McMillan, [Emeka] Egbuka [conversations from 2025] because they’re not all similar players.”\n\nAs it stands, Tate appears to stand out among talent evaluators as the most “clean” player from the threesome, in terms of the total package of consistency, health, size and production. But there’s definitely curiosity about what his pure speed and agility will look like, especially alongside Lemon and Tyson. Some of those questions will be answered — if all three actually do full workouts at the combine, which isn’t guaranteed. Beyond that trio, there will definitely be some gravity toward the next tier of WRs in Washington’s Denzel Boston, Tennessee’s Chris Brazzell II and Notre Dame’s Malachi Fields, who all bring prototypical “X” receiver size to the table. The Bills will be an interesting team to watch with that group.\n\nFor only the second time in 13 years, we could end up seeing only one quarterback selected in the first round. With the Las Vegas Raiders expected to take Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza with the No. 1 pick, it’s also trending toward Mendoza passing on everything at the combine and opening the floor for the rest of the class. That will be a solid opportunity for multiple players, including Alabama’s Ty Simpson, Penn State’s Drew Allar, Miami’s Carson Beck, LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier and others.\n\nIt’s simply not a great class when it comes to star power (that will come in 2027), but there could be a bit of developmental depth with some strong showings.\n\nEven with the thin class, there is still plenty of quarterback need across the league — and that will point plenty of eyes in the direction of Simpson. He was a prospect with some solid draft heat near the midpoint of the college season, but red flags began to get raised as he got knocked around and turned the ball over later in the schedule and then suffered a rib injury that knocked him out of the College Football Playoff. Right now he’s likely to land in the late first to mid-second round range, somewhat similar to how teams were looking at Bo Nix in 2024, and Jaxson Dart and Tyler Shough last year. If Simpson can wow teams in interviews and put up a good workout, he can build momentum to move up the board and get a QB-needy team to expend a first-round pick on him. Already, you hear his name connected a lot to the Los Angeles Rams, who have the 13th and 29th overall picks.\n\nAs for the rest of the pack, it’s unclear what Allar will be able to do at the combine due to an ankle injury that ended his 2025 season. He’s the player with the size and easy arm strength, so he’ll draw in someone believing they can home his considerable talent into consistent results. Same goes for Beck, who also has size and arm, but also some leadership and love-for-the-game questions that teams want to pick at in interviews. Not to mention some bad turnovers in important spots, going all the way back to his time at Georgia. Then there’s Nussmeier, who some evaluators once believed could develop into a first-round pick, maybe even a solidly high one, before injuries derailed much of his 2025 college season. He’ll be another player who draws plenty of eyeballs.\n\nIt’s a loaded class with edge players, with an onslaught at that position expected to end up packing the first round. While there’s still a lot of work ahead, it wouldn’t be surprising to see as many as eight edge rushers come off the board in the first 32 picks. A lot of the attention will go to potential top-10 picks in Texas Tech’s David Bailey, Ohio State’s Arvell Reese and Miami’s Rueben Bain Jr. But there will be a battle to figure out the stack after that trio, with players like Auburn’s Keldric Faulk, Missouri’s Zion Young and Miami’s Akheem Mesidor battling it out. Young is a player to keep an eye on. He had a great week of practice at the Senior Bowl and ended up as the game’s defensive MVP, giving him a lot of buzz coming into the combine. But top to bottom it’s going to be great draft for teams that need edge players and defensive line talent in general.\n\n“It might be one of the deepest [edge] classes ever, especially through the top 50, 60 guys [in the entire draft],” an AFC general manager concluded. “There’s all types of skill sets and body types that fit different needs, but the talent in general just very, very good. There’s really not a Myles Garrett or Nick Bosa, but there’s a half dozen guys who could become just good, core second-contract players for teams.”\n\nBeyond the defensive line, there’s strength in the class of safeties and cornerbacks as well, with as many as a half dozen or more picks in the secondary likely to land in Round 1. And while safety isn’t traditionally a position that sees multiple first-round selections, this will almost certainly be one of those years, with Ohio State’s Caleb Downs, Toledo’s Emmanuel McNeil-Warren and Oregon’s Dillon Thieneman all having the profile to possibly land in the first half of the first round. That just doesn’t happen. Downs in particular will be very intriguing. His résumé is the kind that he’d be an easy top-five pick if he played at a more premium defensive position — and there were times that some evaluators believed he could even be worth that kind of juice in this draft. The overall strength of the defensive class at premium positions is likely to push him down the board, but it’s certainly not lost on front offices that so many of the NFL’s best defenses now feature a dynamic safety like Downs. That could cement Downs higher on teams boards by April.\n\nThe next running back after Notre Dame’s Jeremiyah Love is going to be an interesting development to watch. Overall, the class isn’t amazing and it’s going to be dinged a bit by the free-agent class being so strong. There’s no doubt that some teams want to see what Love’s backup for the Fighting Irish, Jadarian Price, does in the workouts. As much as game tape matters, Price could have transferred elsewhere for the 2025 college football season and doubled his touches while positioning himself to challenge Love as this year’s top running back. Now he comes into the draft with less wear and tear but also some curiosity about whether he can be a centerpiece starter and also catch the ball consistently out of the backfield. His workouts will matter, especially as it pertains to his receiving ability. If he can showcase that and put up the type of athletic numbers that some think he can, there will likely be more Alvin Kamara comparisons to follow. As of now, I’m not sure how that framing works without the receiving end of his game being more proven.\n\nOregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq is going to be interesting. Some evaluators like him as almost a hybrid running back/wide receiver if he fits into the right scheme. Others see him as a plus-level athlete whose “expected” 6-foot-2, 240-pound size is going to make him a bit of a tweener — and not in a good way — in the NFL. There’s curiosity about Sadiq’s true height and weight and what his workouts look like. There’s little doubt he has mismatch potential and maybe some considerable ceiling with the right coach and scheme, but some evaluators don’t see him as the kind of tight end who can fit in a lot of different places and be on the field at the rate of a multitude of TEs from last year’s draft. He can’t be compared realistically to the bigger bodied guys like Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren. And his overall consistency of college production wasn’t in the realm of Brock Bowers going into the 2024 draft. Who is the realistic comparable at the NFL level to Sadiq and what coach can draw that unique talent out of him?",

    "description": "It might take the richest contract ever given to a center to bring Linderbaum to New York. Is he worth it?",
    "fullText": "Tyler Linderbaum might be at the top of the New York Giants’ NFL free agency wish list as they aim to upgrade in the trenches. Getting him, though, is not going to be easy. “Everybody” wants Linderbaum, according to NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah.\n\n“I love my job, but if I could switch jobs for just the next couple months I’d want to be Tyler Linderbaum’s agent,” Jeremiah said Thursday on a pre-NFL Scouting Combine call with media. ‘Everybody that I talk to seems to be in on Tyler Linderbaum. It sounds like he’s going to have a robust market.“\n\nLinderbaum, of course, was the center for Giants coach John Harbaugh with the Baltimore Ravens for the past four years. The 25th pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, Linderbaum was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his last three seasons.\n\nEntering his age 26 season, Linderbaum is about to be a very rich young man. Creed Humphrey of the Kansas City Chiefs is the league’s highest-paid center. He signed a four-year, $72 million contract, an average of $18 million per year.\n\nLinderbaum’s contract, especially with a “robust market,” figures to equal or exceed that figure.\n\nThe Ravens are hoping to keep Linderbaum in Baltimore.\n\n“We got some work to do on Tyler Linderbaum’s contract,” DeCosta said on ‘The Inner Circle Podcast.’ “We strongly hope to have him back. He’s a great player for us and a great leader.”\n\nDo the Giants “need” Linderbaum badly enough to be willing to reset the center market financially? Perhaps not. John Michael Schmitz is a capable center who has improved in each of his first three seasons.\n\nLinderbaum, though, would be an upgrade. Harbaugh, who has said consistently that continuing to upgrade the talent on both the offensive and defensive lines is a must for the Giants, might be willing to do whatever it takes to get the player who orchestrated his offensive line in Baltimore.\n\nIs Linderbaum worth the biggest contract ever given to a center, Giants fans?",

    "fullText": "The NFL Combine is less than a week away. With the NFL world descending on Lucas Oil Stadium for the annual meat market, who are the prospects that could make a big impression in the biggest job interview of their lives? And could any be on the radar of the Jacksonville Jaguars? Let’s take a look:\n\nJonah Coleman is RB2 in the class and it's not close based on film + statistics:\n\n– Creative when play shuts down\n– Vision, feet, movement in sync\n– Best RB after contact in class\n\nHe's very good at pressing the LOS.\n\nCreative runner that turns a lot of these type of plays into… pic.twitter.com/wsR0QKU60W\n\n— Snoog's Fantasy HQ (@FFSnoog) February 13, 2026\n\nWith the combine focusing on raw measurables, Jonah Coleman has every opportunity to push himself into the same tier as Jeremiyah Love next week. Coleman isn’t expected to be the quickest running back in the room; he’s a short, dense ‘bowling ball’ style back whose physical style of running has made him a consistent contributor for the Huskies over three seasons. What Coleman needs to show is that he’s fast enough, and a 4.5 second forty time at his size and play strength will certainly turn heads.\n\nWith Travis Etienne’s future in Jacksonville still unsure, running back may be a target position for the Jaguars in the draft. Coleman’s 4.29 yards after contact average (in the 97th percentile at his position) will appeal to James Gladstone, whose selection of Bhayshul Tuten last year shows his penchant for pinball wizards in the backfield.\n\nMississippi State WR Brenen Thompson beating both of the TCU corners on double moves.\n\nHe's definitely gonna fly next week in Indy. pic.twitter.com/fOePdNM99c\n\n— Derrick (@Steelers_DB) February 20, 2026\n\nLife in Starkville has been tough the past few seasons. But wide receiver Brenen Thompson made a wise decision leaving Oklahoma for Mississippi State last year, enjoying a breakout campaign that saw him break 1,000 yards receiving. Key to that production was his unparalleled speed, with many expecting him to challenge Matthew Golden’s 4.29 second forty from last season. Thompson’s average depth of target (aDOT) last season was an outrageous 18.4 yards – for context, the NFL average is around 11.0.\n\nAt 5’9” and 170lbs, there’ll be concerns about Thompson’s longevity in the NFL. But athleticism grabs the headlines at the combine. I’m not sure if it’s a profile the Jaguars front office will be interested in, but with rumors persisting about Brian Thomas being traded, adding to the position group is a distinct possibility.\n\nThe right NFL OL coach is going to turn Arizona State's Max Iheanachor into a Pro Bowler. pic.twitter.com/ITAvB6DWci\n\n— Tyler Brooke (@TylerDBrooke) February 5, 2026\n\nIf you’re looking for a physical freak with unreasonable athleticism, Iheanachor might be your guy. Starring at the Senior Bowl, the former Sun Devil has already elevated his stock through the early part of draft season. And if scouts want to go and check the tape, they’ll see a prospect who allowed zero sacks on almost 500 pass-blocking snaps in 2025.\n\nStanding at 6’6”, weighing 330lbs and having ludicrous 34.5” arms, Iheanachor is a mountain of a man. But it’s a mountain that can move, with him expected to run somewhere in the region of a 5.15 second forty and show off his lateral agility in the other tests. Iheanachor might have pushed himself into day one contention, but if he’s still there on Friday, could the Jags be interested in bolstering their offensive line?\n\n#SouthCarolina CB Brandon Cisse is one of the best athletes in the 2026 drafts CB class.\n\nTwitched up defender with elite speed and fluidity, very sticky in man coverage and has a ton of versatility. Top-50 player on my Big Board. pic.twitter.com/Vq1bmHJ97X\n\n— Andy (@AndyyNFL) December 12, 2025\n\nThe secondary is a big need for the Jaguars this offseason, and I would be surprised if they didn’t at least partially address it in free agency. But should they be looking for someone who can start on the outside as a rookie, then perhaps Brandon Cisse is on their radar…\n\nCisse has elite athleticism across the board; expectations of a forty inch vertical jump and a sub-four second 20-yard shuttle demonstrate his explosiveness. At approximately 6’0” and 195lbs he’s got the measurables, and he showed a big improvement on his career numbers during his one year as a Gamecock. 19 solo tackles tells you he can be left on an island, and his proficiency in press man coverage could appeal to Gladstone. With his stock about to explode, it would likely take a trade back into the first round to make him a Jaguar.\n\nOne thing about Red Murdock (#2) is that he'll light a mf up pic.twitter.com/Lfyi2jv3aI\n\n— JP Acosta (@acosta32_jp) February 13, 2026\n\nOne of the coolest names in the draft also belongs to one of the most productive players in this year’s class. Red Murdock has dominated for the Bulls the last two seasons, racking up 298 tackles, 30 TFL’s and seven sacks during that time. Murdock is expected to perform extremely well in the shuttle and mirror drills at the combine, whose monstrous stats have often been attributed to his sideline to sideline speed and read-and-chase ability.\n\nIf Devin Lloyd leaves town during free agency, a huge chunk of the Jaguars’ turnovers from last season leaves with him. In that regard Murdock could be the perfect replacement; the former Buffalo linebacker set an FBS record with 17 career forced fumbles, all in the past three seasons. Murdock is likely to still be on the board on Day 3, even with a strong performance in Indy. Value like that might be too hard for this front office to ignore.",

However, as you can see by the current roster, depth is needed. Specifically, another blocking presence is needed to pair with Warren. Shane Steichen uses his fair share of two tight end sets.\n\nMallory provides more of a pass-catching presence and has struggled to earn playing time. The Colts could look to bring back Alie-Cox and/or Ogletree to fill that blocking-specific role.

    "description": "Should the Tennessee Titans re-sign OT Oli Udoh? Previewing NFL Free Agency for GM Mike Borgonzi.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Music City Miracles’ Tennessee Titans 2026 NFL Free Agency Primer! The negotiating window period begins on March 9th, but the Titans are able to re-sign their own free agents before then. General manager Mike Borgonzi is equipped with more than $100 million in cap space and will collaborate with new head coach Robert Saleh on their shared vision for the 2026 Titans.\n\nThe Titans are currently scheduled to possess 29 free agents (19 unrestricted), including several key starters and role players. Over the next few weeks, we’ll take an in-depth look at each free agent and provide arguments for why the Titans should, or shouldn’t re-sign that player. We’ll also offer our final verdict and a prediction to go along with our analysis.\n\nToday, we’re analyzing offensive tackle Oli Udoh.\n\nUdoh ended up playing a valuable swing role for the Titans behind starters JC Latham and Dan Moore Jr. As far as backup tackles go, he performed reasonably well. Pro Football Focus assigned identical overall and pass-blocking grades of 55.0. The Titans’ offense rarely suffered specifically because Udoh was in the lineup.\n\nPFF also credited Udoh with allowing 19 pressures, three sacks, and being whistled for six penalties. That’s a fair amount of negative plays for a tackle who earned just 274 reps at left and right tackle. Perhaps the Titans could identify a more suitable reserve tackle in free agency.\n\nSpotrac does not have a projected contract for Udoh. He signed a one-year, $1,170,000 million contract with the Titans last offseason. An extension would probably be in a similar range, maybe with a slight raise in pay.\n\nThe Titans should re-sign Udoh. His level of play improved as the campaign progressed forward. Udoh wasn’t a drive-killer when he entered games, and that’s the realistic expectation for reserve tackles. The former Elon standout was even better than recent starters at tackle for the Titans like Dennis Daley, Nicholas Petit-Frere, and Andre Dillard.\n\nThe Titans re-sign Udoh to another one-year contract.",

And with the Minnesota Vikings holding the 18th overall pick, NFL.com’s Daniel Jeremiah believes Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores will scoop a Harrison Smith replacement: Oregon safety Dillon Thieneman.\n\nNFL.com ties Minnesota to Thieneman as the Smith succession plan, signaling a 2026 secondary transition.\n\nIt’s not yet clear whether Smith will retire, but if so, Thieneman might have the juice to fill his shoes.\n\nAnother mock draft for the Vikings — more defense.\n\nJeremiah: Thieneman to Vikings at No. 18\n\nBecause Lewis Cine didn’t pan out and the fact that Smith may indeed retire soon, Minnesota will need a safety for the long haul. Jeremiah thinks Thieneman is the right guy.\n\nHe wrote Tuesday, “After studying Thieneman’s impressive 2025 tape at Oregon, I went back and watched the film from his career at Purdue, where he played in 2023 and ’24. His range and playmaking skills were evident back then, too. He would be an excellent replacement for Harrison Smith.”\n\nJeremiah continued the defensive trend for the Vikings’ spot in mock drafts. Most editions have the club selecting a defensive back or defensive lineman.\n\nThieneman is 6’0 and 200 pounds and will turn 22 in August. He’s known for his versatility at safety, which sounds like a page from the Smith playbook. His ball-tracking is elite for a rookie prospect, and he is known for high football IQ. NFL.com recently compared him to Jevon Holland, a safety for the New York Giants.\n\nA to Z Sports‘ Rob Gregson on Thieneman: “You turn on three years’ worth of tape from Thieneman, and it just gets better and better. After bursting on to the scene as a true freshman in 2023, where he recorded six interceptions, Thieneman then led the Big-10 in tackles in 2024, before doing a little bit of everything for the Ducks in 2025.”\n\n“You’re betting on instincts and explosion with Thieneman. He may not be elite laterally and challenged in terms of his man coverage projection, but if you need a player who can play the high post, poach the middle as a robber, and align as a box safety for a plus one help in the run game, Thieneman is your guy.”\n\nNFL.com’s Lance Zierlein: “Savvy three-year starter with NFL size, speed and alignment versatility. Thieneman is an extension of his defensive coordinator, aligning and adjusting the secondary to motion and pre-snap shifts. He’s an instinctive, rangy safety who can roll down into big nickel or robber positioning.”\n\n“He has a good feel for play design and route concepts in zone but has average change of direction to match breaks in man. He’s not a big thumper near the line, but he rushes into the action with a relentless pursuit that should allow him to keep stacking high scores in the tackle columns. Thieneman checks important boxes for teams looking to add versatile playmakers in the secondary.”\n\nThe 2026 Safeties + a Smith Verdict\n\nIf one pretends that Smith will indeed retire, Minnesota’s safety group would look like this in 2026 with Thieneman:\n\nIt’s also worth noting that, as of February 18th, there’s been no official retirement announcement from Smith, which is a bit odd. He can still call it quits, but with each day that passes, Smith is more likely to return for Year No. 15, especially with Flores back in the saddle as the defensive coordinator.\n\nThieneman ranks No. 37 on the Consensus Big Board at the time of this article’s publication. He might be a 2nd-Round commodity. If the Vikings don’t reach and pick him at No. 18, the team’s draftboard might resemble this, based on the best player available and long-term roster need:\n\nEmmanuel McNeil-Warren (S, Toledo)\n\nKayden McDonald (DT, Ohio State)\n\nJordyn Tyson (WR, Arizona State)\n\nThe NFL draft is about nine weeks away. Minnesota has at least nine picks line up this cycle — four more than last year, when the club had a skimpy cupboard due to the expensive Dallas Turner trade in 2024.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this year, domestic violence allegations against Chiefs receiver Rashee Rice surfaced on Instagram. New allegations have emerged against Rice in a lawsuit that was initiated earlier this week.\n\nVia James Newell of The Athletic, the civil complaint filed Monday in Dallas County District Court includes the following contentions: \"Defendant Rashee Rice and Plaintiff Dacoda Jones lived together. Following an escalation in violent behavior, in December, 2023, Defendant Rashee Rice strangled Plaintiff Dacoda Joans [sic] at their shared home in Victory Park, Texas. Defendant Rashee Rice continued to repeatedly assaulted Dacoda Jones over the course of their relationship through July, 2025. Defendant Rice has grabbed, choked, strangled, pushed, thrown, scratched, hit, and headbutted Ms. Jones, as well as hit her with inanimate objects. Additionally, he has engaged in other violent and abusive behaviors towards Ms. Jones, including throwing objects, destroying property, punching walls, and breaking furniture, as well as locking her out in the middle of the night. Many of these behaviors occurred while Ms. Jones was pregnant.\"\n\nThe league previously commenced a review based on the allegations from Instagram. The league undoubtedly will expand the investigation to include the claims made in the new lawsuit.\n\nRice served a six-game suspension to start the 2025 season, following a guilty plea to a March 2024 street-racing incident. His history could result in enhanced penalties, if the league finds he violated the Personal Conduct Policy again.\n\nThe situation also potentially impacts Rice's probation resulting from the street-racing incident. The agreement was announced in July; if any potential abuse occurred after the five-year period of probation commenced, he could face an argument that he violated the terms of his probation.",

    "description": "Three Detroit Lions landed in early 2026 NFL free agency rankings. Here’s what it means for Detroit.",
    "fullText": "As the Detroit Lions continue to balance a win-now roster with long-term cap flexibility, it’s no surprise to see several key contributors showing up in early 2026 NFL free agency rankings.\n\nAccording to Daniel Popper of The Athletic, three Lions defenders landed inside his positional rankings ahead of the 2026 offseason, a reminder that Detroit’s depth and development on defense hasn’t gone unnoticed around the league.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the Lions players who made the list and what it could mean for Brad Holmes’ offseason decisions.\n\nVeteran linebacker Alex Anzalone checks in at No. 49 overall in Popper’s rankings, with a projected contract of two years, $21 million.\n\nAnzalone has quietly been one of the most reliable pieces of Detroit’s defense over the past five seasons. He’s averaged nearly 100 tackles per year with the Lions and continues to thrive as a rangy, athletic off-ball linebacker.\n\nPopper highlights Anzalone’s speed, coverage versatility, and pass-rush value, noting that his 29.0% pressure rate ranked second among all off-ball linebackers. While he may not be the most physical run defender, his ability to blitz, cover, and diagnose plays keeps him highly valuable — especially in modern defenses.\n\nComing in at No. 79, edge rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad is projected by Popper to command a two-year, $18 million deal.\n\nMuhammad put together a breakout 2025 season, finishing with 11 sacks, the most among Detroit’s impending free agents. While he doesn’t have elite size or athletic traits for an edge defender, his efficiency stands out.\n\nPopper points to Muhammad’s ability to win late in reps, strong hand usage, and consistent pressure, noting that he ranked 14th in pressure rate among players with at least 250 pass-rush snaps.\n\nThat production makes him an ideal situational pass rusher — the kind of player teams covet for third-down packages.\n\nDefensive tackle Roy Lopez lands at No. 107 in the rankings, with a projected two-year, $12 million contract.\n\nLopez isn’t flashy, but his value lies in doing the dirty work. Popper describes him as a stout, technically sound nose tackle who can hold ground against double teams while still offering some interior push on passing downs.\n\nFor a Lions defense that has emphasized toughness and gap integrity up front, Lopez’s ability to stack blockers and control the interior has been quietly important.\n\nSeeing three Lions defenders ranked by Daniel Popper reinforces just how many tough decisions Detroit may face in the 2026 offseason. Retaining all three won’t be easy, especially with cap constraints looming, but each player fills a specific role that aligns with Dan Campbell’s defensive identity.\n\nWhether Brad Holmes chooses to re-sign, replace, or reshuffle these spots, one thing is clear: the rest of the league is paying attention to Detroit’s talent pipeline — and it’s going to cost real money to keep it intact.\n\nThe post 3 Detroit Lions Included in 2026 NFL Free Agency Rankings appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "Here are some potential targets if the Eagles move off Jahan Dotson and explore free agency to find a replacement.",
    "fullText": "The life of a slot receiver on a Nick Sirianni-led Philadelphia Eagles team can be pretty uneventful. Sure, you're on the field, but for the most part, you're seen as expendable. Shortly after entering the NovaCare Complex, you were told that A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert will get the lion's share of targets.\n\nJahan Dotson's fate seemed sealed once we learned that Philadelphia was declining the fifth-year option on his rookie deal. There's been no extension announced, so we're going to assume we've seen his last game in an Eagles jersey. Here are a few options if free agency is explored to find a replacement.\n\nMaybe he's too rich for the Eagles' blood. Maybe he's less expensive than exercising Dotson's fifth-year option would have been. Who knows? One thing is certain. Alec Pierce is more than likely on the lists of every NFL team that will shop for a new wide receiver on the open market.\n\nDeebo Samuel doesn't have much left. Jauan Jennings seems to be too rich for Philadelphia's blood (and that's if he gets out of San Francisco). Rashid Shaheed is, seemingly, however, everything that Quez Watkins was supposed to become.\n\nHe has the hands that Watkins never had. Hmmm... Did Shaheed even drop a pass this season? Oh, and by the way, he's a nice option to return kicks, something the Eagles struggled with last season.\n\nIf Romeo Doubs were to land in Philadelphia, he might change Coach Sirianni's mind about ignoring the third receiver. This young man is too good to ignore.\n\nHe consistently wins contested catches, but sometimes that's a sign of something else. 'Contested catches' can sometimes mean guys are struggling to get open.\n\nEverything we've seen from Wan'Dale Robinson has come from seeing him play on an NFC East rival's roster. Often, he has had to do that without decent quarterback play. The G-Men added Jaxson Dart, and that helped. He had the best season of his career with Malik Nabers out.\n\nRobinson notched 92 receptions, 1,014 yards, and four TDs. He averages 9.2 yards per reception for his career, so he hasn't traveled very far down the field for the most part, but in this offense, the underneath stuff might be all that he needs to do.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Free Agency: 4 targets Eagles could sign to replace Jahan Dotson",

    "description": "On Friday, the NFL Players Association fired long-time security officer Craig Jones, whose eloquent email challenging the state of union leadership emerged last year, during the quickly-unfolding turmoil that resulted in the abrupt resignation of NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell.",
    "fullText": "On Friday, the NFL Players Association fired long-time security officer Craig Jones, whose eloquent email challenging the state of union leadership emerged last year, during the quickly-unfolding turmoil that resulted in the abrupt resignation of NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell.\n\nAfter being fired, Jones sent a new email to various current and former NFLPA employees. PFT has obtained a copy of the email, and has verified its authenticity.\n\nBecause Jones speaks directly to players in his email, and because plenty of players visit this space from time to time, we've decided to post the message in full.\n\nBefore posting, we invited the NFLPA to respond to all or any portion of it. The union declined to comment.\n\nHere's the full content of the Craig Jones email:\n\n\"Good day. My name is Craig Hampton Jones, and for 17 1/2 years, I was in the employ of the NFLPA. I served the union and the players we served with professional carriage, dedication, and with an enthusiasm for excellence. Through the years, I earned the respect of my peers and the players we served.\n\n\"On Jan. 18, 2026, I was informed that I was being placed on administrative leave for sending emails. On Feb. 13 2026 while in the throes of a family member being murdered on Jan. 25, while caring for my 94 year old mother who suffers with dementia, I received an email from Kim Murray that I was terminated immediately for sending emails deemed antagonistic.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Lloyd Howell's debacle and resignation, I sent an all staff email asking how we as a union move forward, cleansed of the miasma of Lloyd Howell's strip club schemes to undermine the NFLPA if chief architects of those schemes were still employed at the NFLPA.\n\n\"Another email that was deemed antagonistic was asking Jalen Maybin how you chose a new Executive Director with the same obvious flawed format that chose Lloyd Howell. My query was deemed antagonistic. But on Feb. 3, 2026, at the NFLPA press conference, 42 minutes in, Mike Jones of [The Athletic] asked Mr. Maybin, the exact same question I asked Mr. Maybin. At the same press conference, 54 minutes in Johnathan Jones of CBS Sports asked Mr. Maybin as well about the integrity of a selection process that is done 'oscuro.' My termination is nothing more than retaliation because I spoke simple truths to corrupt jaundice power. I couldn't stand silently by and watch the undermining of a storied union dedicated to the players whose trust we had earned with employees of commitment and a consistent well spring of results for our players.\n\n\"Charlatans bought in by Lloyd Howell in his attempt to pimp like Anamika Gupta and Matt Curtin, still lurk the halls of the NFLPA. And to make matters worse, the eunuch-esque leadership of David White and Jaylen Maybin and the jaded leadership of the HR department, morale is low in absence of prodigious leadership akin to Gene Upshaw and DeMaurice Smith.\n\n\"But players of today and storied players of yesteryear . . . don't despair or lose faith in the NFLPA.\n\n\"Even though the loyal workforce was eviserated [sic] unjustly by the Lloyd Howell banana republic and his leftover operatives still attempt to contaminate, please know players that there is still a small collective of honest, hardworking ethical staff who on most nights take their work on your behalf home with them because their regard for the players they behold as sacred.\n\n\"And despite the stench that still permeates in the ranks of some executive leadership, the rank and file of the employees who champion player concerns have faith that one day soon, players will again step up to preserve their gains and perform an exorcism within NFLPA executive leadership. The players once again becoming truly their brothers keeper will restore the union back to its illustrious mission. Always know players... with men of courage and altruism at the helm of leadership, the employees will ensure that you will never walk alone.\n\n\"To my former co-workers whom I hold so dear...you know who you are. I genuflect in your honor on how you continue unselfishly you to serve players with unwavering verve and professional aplomb as executive ineptitude swirls still around you. Don't despair. Muhammad Ali once told me, 'the deeper the pressure, the greater the poise.' You will always be cherished.\n\n\"I love you. Please remember what I always told you that I will always protect you so you can get home to your loved one's first, then I can go home to my love ones. Don't worry about me. No go fund me. I will for free any day protect what is right for free. As a prostate cancer survivor, I have no fear of the folly of fragile egotistical men. Tim Christine. I will always be indebted to the quasar light of your leadership. Finally to Don Davis and Zamir Cobb. I wish you well. You could have stood up for me.\n\nThe email strongly suggests that Jones will be exploring his options for a possible legal challenge to the termination. The union currently is defending a lawsuit filed by former in-house counsel Heather McPhee.\n\nAgain, the NFLPA has declined to comment on the termination of Jones, or as to the contents of his email.",

    "description": "The NFL's franchise tag window opened on Tuesday. Will the Broncos use one this offseason?",
    "fullText": "Beginning today, NFL teams are allowed to place one-year franchise (or transition) tags on one player ahead of the 2026 season. The deadline to place a one-year tag is March 3.\n\nIf a player is tagged, they have until July 15 to reach a long-term extension. If no extension is reached before that date, the player will spend the 2026 season on a one-year tag deal.\n\nDue to the high salaries associated with the tags, the Denver Broncos seem very unlikely to use one this offseason. The team's most notable pending free agent on offense is running back J.K. Dobbins, but the cost to franchise tag a running back is $14,536,000.\n\nThe club's most notable defensive player is defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers. Depending on whether he's categorized as a defensive end or defensive tackle, JFM's tag would be either $27,322,000 or $26,311,000. Either figure would likely be far out of Denver's offseason budget.\n\nDobbins might be a candidate to re-sign on a team-friendly, one-year deal, but it looks like JFM will be allowed to test the open market next month. The Broncos are not expected to tag either player before the March 3 deadline.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL free agency: Will Broncos use franchise tag in 2026?",

    "fullText": "Three-year NFL veteran and safety for the Cleveland Browns, Ronnie Hickman, was assaulted by a group of four individuals following a confrontation in the lobby of a Sixty Les hotel located on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York. The incident occurred at approximately 4:30 am after a group of individuals, who remain unidentified, approached Hickman shortly after he entered the building.\n\nAccording to the local authorities who originally spoke with the New York Post, police are actively investigating the matter, as well as whether or not Hickman’s status as a professional athlete had any influence in their decision to approach him. “The suspects slugged Hickman and took off,” the official report states.\n\nThe franchise itself confirmed that Hickman “was a victim of assault early Monday morning at a New York City hotel,” and a personal representative of the Ohio State product also informed the post that “Ronnie was treated for minor injuries at an area hospital after the incident, was later released, and is home resting with his family.”\n\nThe incident, unfortunately, comes right after Hickman had managed to enjoy a career-defining breakout. After recording just 70 total tackles with the Browns throughout all of 2023 and 2024, he managed to finally become a full-time starter in 2025.\n\nThe 2023 undrafted free agent tallied 103 combined tackles throughout his 17 starts this past season, snagging two interceptions and deflecting seven passes along the way. At this time, police have admitted that no arrests have been made and that all four of the primary suspects remain at large.\n\nStaff members who were on site at the time of the assault have also refused to offer up any sort of comments on the issue, but given the upscale nature of the establishment, it’s widely speculated that Hickman may have been profiled. The 24-year-old prospect is set to become a restricted free agent later this offseason, and will likely be resigning with the Browns for a “projected contract between $7 million to $8 million.”\n\nABC7 has suggested that Hickman was, in fact, identified by the four individuals, and that things only escalated after Hickman refused to acknowledge them, but that has yet to be confirmed by either official sources or any of the members in Hickman’s camp.\n\nThe post Cleveland Browns News: Ronnie Hickman Attacked by Goons in Sixty Les Hotel’s Lobby, No Arrests Yet appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Who do you want the Eagles to draft?",
    "fullText": "Some of us may have the day off, but mock drafts never do.\n\nAfter a brief pause in 2024, Howie Roseman got back to trading first-round picks last year. He sticks to that habit by sending a late third- and fourth-round pick to the Vikings so he can snag another big-play machine for an Eagles offense that disappointed in 2025. Tyson dealt with multiple injuries at the college level but could prove to be a steal here, thanks to his ability to win downfield.\n\nIn this mock the Eagles trade up to 18 with the Vikings. If something like this were to happen, this would be another “how are teams letting the Eagles do this” move. Tyson has a lot of love in the draft community. I don’t quite get the hype, but that’s just me.\n\nHe may not have as much love in the NFL community though, as his injury history is a big concern. He missed time in 2022 and 2023 from a torn ACL, MCL, and PCL. He missed time in 2024 with a broken collarbone. He missed time in 2025 with injuries to both hamstrings.\n\nThe Eagles have work to do along the offensive line this offseason, especially with the injury issues that 35-year-old right tackle Lane Johnson had in 2025. Iheanachor had a great week at the Senior Bowl that fortified his status as one of the highest-upside players in this class. He has terrific size at 6-foot-6 and 330 pounds, plus his nifty footwork allows him to hold up in pass protection.\n\nIheanachor will need time to develop, as he did not play high school football and must refine his technique. (He took nine penalties in 2025, too.) Philly would be an ideal landing spot since he can sit and learn behind a future Hall of Famer for at least a year.\n\nIheanachor is a risk, but that has never stopped the Eagles.\n\nIheanachor moved to America from Nigeria when he was 13 and as Yates says, he didn’t play football in high school, starting his career at East Los Angeles College, a JUCO, transferring after two seasons. He started all 14 Sun Devil games this year, and 5 last year. A team that can have him continuing to bake as a backup makes sense, he’s got a lot of room to grow. He moves pretty stiff, and he looks like he’s still figuring things out. I’d also like to see my big OT play with some nastinesses, which I didn’t see from him.\n\nThe need to develop is to be expected, he wasn’t playing football five years ago. But new OL coach Chris Kuper has no track record of development, and Lane Johnson has missed time in every season since 2015, so his primary backup is going to see the field.\n\nIf AJ Brown moves on this offseason, the Philadelphia Eagles could turn to Washington’s Denzel Boston to fill the X-receiver role. Boston blends size, skill, and scoring ability into a package tailor-made for the NFL, offering a proven knack for turning targets into explosive plays.\n\nBoston’s fluidity, tempo management, and zone IQ also give him polished route-running skills, making him a true X-receiver prospect with immediate impact potential. For the Eagles, he offers the kind of contested-catch ability and downfield production that can change the dynamic of the passing game from day one.\n\nWe can go ahead and skip the “if.” One reason is that this is a good draft for big WRs, replacing AJ Brown, at least in theory, will be an option in the draft. Along with Boston, Ohio State’s Carnell Tate–who won’t be on the board when the Eagles currently pick, Jordyn Tyson, Louisville’s Chris Bell, and Notre Dame’s Malachi Fields are options too.\n\nBoston does a really good job of using his size as a weapon, but he’s not just a contested catch merchant, his separation is good too. He might not run the fastest 40 but he can go get the ball down the field. I’m a fan.",

But, hey, she won silver ― another medal in an illustrious Winter Olympics career.\n\nSports: Norwegian Ski Superstar Makes Winter Olympics History With Record-Breaking Gold\n\nGarrett, the Cleveland Browns star who broke the season record for sacks, let his beloved know Saturday she’s still the GOAT in her sport and in his heart.\n\n“So proud of you!” he wrote with a photo of a flag-holding Kim celebrating her medal. “I’m thankful that I get to be by your side watching the extraordinary things you do. You fought through so much to even get to this point and you earned everything and more. The 🐐, my love and my Valentine.

    "fullText": "Every offseason brings speculation, projection models, and plenty of debate — but nothing captures long-range anticipation quite like the way-too-early MVP odds. Before a single snap of the season is played, sportsbooks and analysts are already trying to forecast which superstar will dominate the narrative across the NFL landscape in 2026. These early numbers don’t just reflect talent — they reflect team trajectory, offensive stability, durability, and the ever-important storylines that shape voter perception.\n\nAt the front of the conversation are familiar faces who’ve already proven they can carry franchises and command national attention. Josh Allen remains a perennial contender because of his rare blend of physicality and high-volume production. Lamar Jackson continues to redefine quarterback play with explosive dual-threat impact that can reshape games week to week. Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes is almost permanently positioned in MVP discussions simply because excellence has become routine.\n\nJust behind them sit elite passers still chasing that defining MVP season. Justin Herbert possesses statistical upside that could translate into award recognition if team success follows. And Joe Burrow continues to build a résumé centered on precision, composure, and winning in high-leverage moments.\n\nOf course, “way too early” is the operative phrase. Injuries, breakout stars, coaching changes, and unexpected team surges will inevitably reshape the race. But right now, these odds offer a snapshot of who the football world expects to define the 2026 season — and whose performance could ultimately shape the league’s competitive hierarchy.\n\nOdds: +550\nAllen’s MVP case always starts with his physical dominance — few quarterbacks can stress defenses as both a power runner and vertical passer the way he does. If his efficiency stabilizes late in the season and turnover swings tighten up, he becomes incredibly hard to beat in voting. A top seed paired with highlight-reel production would make him the clear betting favorite.\n\nOdds: +650\nJackson’s ceiling is still unmatched when his rushing explosiveness and passing rhythm peak at the same time. Voters tend to reward his dual-threat dominance when his offense is built around his improvisational strengths. Another season where he controls tempo and stays healthy deep into January would put him squarely in the MVP spotlight again.\n\nOdds: +1000\nMahomes is almost permanently in the MVP conversation because of how consistently he elevates his offense regardless of surrounding personnel. If his statistical output rebounds into league-leading territory while maintaining elite situational play, the narrative momentum quickly returns. He’s the classic “never count him out” candidate when big moments pile up.\n\nOdds: +1000\nHerbert’s MVP path hinges on translating elite arm talent into sustained team success over a full season. When his deep passing and high-volume production align with efficient red-zone execution, his numbers look historic. A breakout year in the win column could finally convert his statistical brilliance into major award recognition.\n\nOdds: +1000\nBurrow’s candidacy thrives on precision, timing, and leadership in high-leverage moments. When his offense operates at peak efficiency and he controls games late, voters tend to gravitate toward his poised style. If he combines elite passing totals with another deep playoff push narrative, his MVP momentum can surge quickly.\n\nEarly MVP odds are less prediction and more temperature check — a reflection of reputation, momentum, and projected opportunity. They highlight who the league believes will matter most before the season even begins. And while the eventual winner often emerges from unexpected circumstances, these early favorites set the stage for the narratives, rivalries, and performances that will define the 2026 MVP race.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Way too early NFL MVP odds for 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

The Kelce brothers showcased their creativity for Valentine’s Day by making cheeky, punny cards. The Chiefs’ tight end made sweet references to Jumanji, his NFL career, and even Swift’s sourdough obsession. However, fans were impressed by Kelce’s witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood” in one of the creatives shared via an Instagram carousel.\n\nTravis Kelce referenced Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The New Heights podcast’s official Instagram account shared a carousel showcasing their wholesome Valentine’s Day greetings. The first slide in the carousel read, “Wood you be my Valentine?” accompanied by an animated tree and Kelce smiling.\n\nFor those who missed it, this is a reference to Swift’s raunchy track “Wood” from her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl. Notably, the global pop star has dedicated the song to her fiancé. The lyrics make a cheeky reference to Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, and his manhood as well. Swift sings, “New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood) / I ain’t gotta knock on wood” (via Page Six).\n\nFans are loving Kelce’s sweet tribute to Swift and lavished praise in the comments section. One fan commented, “Y’all had the opportunity to do the funniest thing and you did! Good job!!!” A second fan wrote, “These are too good,” accompanied by a laughing emoji. A third fan penned, “WOOD YOU BE MY VALENTINE HAHAHAHAHAH 13/13,” accompanied by clapping emojis. Finally, one fan remarked, “The wood one is my fav.”\n\nFans joked that Kelce is redeeming himself after previously not understanding a witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood.” During the Wednesday, January 21, episode of New Heights, Kelce joked that “Taylor’s gonna kill me” for missing a clear reference to Swift’s song “Wood.”\n\nThe post Travis Kelce’s Valentine’s Day Card Comes With Taylor Swift Twist appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Player trades in the NFL have become more common in recent years, and one NFL insider believes the trend will continue this offseason.\n\nOn a recent episode of “The Adam Schefter Podcast,” the ESPN NFL reporter said it may be tougher for teams to get impact players this season through traditional means, meaning teams will likely be involved in more trades.\n\n“When we talk about the draft, and we’ll see how it shakes out over time, people aren’t all that excited about the draft,” Schefter said. “We got a free-agent class that’s not really deep. We’ve got a draft that is not considered really deep. You know what that tells me? More trades. That’s what it tells me. It tells me we may get more wheeling and dealing in trades than we’ve had in other years.”\n\nSchefter added that although he has not heard any specific trades that are brewing, he sees the activity around the Nov. 4 trade deadline as an indication of teams willing to make more deals to fix their rosters.\n\nThe trade market could be utilized by teams to acquire quarterbacks. This year’s quarterback draft class is not projected to be as strong as recent years, with Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza expected to go as the first overall pick and Alabama’s Ty Simpson appearing to be the only other quarterback projected as a first-round selection.\n\nKyler Murray (Arizona Cardinals) and Mac Jones (San Francisco 49ers) are expected to be the top targets on the trade market, with Raiders quarterback Geno Smith also expected to garner interest.\n\nOn the defensive side, Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby could be another player moved, although it has been previously reported that a deal for him could come after he finishes recovering from a knee injury he suffered late last season.",

    "title": "2026 NFL mock draft tracker: 40 mocks, 21 prospects for Dallas Cowboys",
    "description": "There are so many mock drafts.",
    "fullText": "At the end of January, we published our first mock draft database of the season. At the time, 21 of the 25 mocks (84%) were projecting the Cowboys to take a linebacker, with Sonny Styles (17 mocks, 68%) the clear favorite. The second most popular position was cornerback with 15 picks (60%), followed by edge rushers with 11 picks (44%). The early consensus seemed to be LB Sonny Styles with the 12th pick and a CB with the 20th pick, a combo offered by 10 of the 25 mocks or 40% of the time.\n\nBut a lot has happened since then: The Super Bowl came and went, this year’s salary cap was announced, the Senior Bowl is behind us, and the Cowboys look to have completed their coaching hires, so it’s again time to turn our attention to the very serious business of mock drafting.\n\nOn the hypothesis that the predictive value of multiple mock drafts is greater than that of a single mock, we are taking a survey of 40 different mock drafts today. Importantly, all 40 mocks were published on or after February 1st, giving us a big data set of the latest mock drafts. And here are all those 40 mocks, and which two players they have the Cowboys selecting.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nThat’s a ton of info to digest, with 21 different prospects mocked to the Cowboys somewhere in the first round, so let’s look at a few more digestible extracts from this exercise, starting with how this round of mocks compares to the last one.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nMock Draft distribution by Player Posiition\n\nWhat we see here is a shift away from linebackers to edge rushers, plus a strong increase in “other positions” that didn’t get much attention in January. Naturally, this produces some “winners and losers” among the players mocked to Dallas:\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nMock Draft distribution by Player Posiition\n\nSonny Styles still remains the consensus favorite for the Cowboys, but his lead over other prospects has dropped. At cornerback, the attention in the mock drafts shifted towards the top two guys in this draft class, Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy at the expense of the other corners in this class. At edge, the Cowboys are completely out of the Rueben Bain and David Bailey sweepstakes, but Cashius Howell and T.J. Parker are new names popping up in the mocks. Safety is getting some mock interest, but having Caleb Downs dropping all the way to No. 12 seems more like a pipe dream than anything else at the moment. But keep an eye on Emmanuel McNeill-Warren, he’s been getting increasing interest lately. Also, why anybody would have the Cowboys invest their No. 12 pick in a WR, RB, or DT is completely beyond me.\n\nBut all of that doesn’t yet tell us too much about how the first round could play out for the Cowboys. For that, I plotted where seven specific players were taken in each of the 50 mocks. Those seven players are:\n\nThe top safety, and maybe the best player in the draft, Caleb Downs\n\nThe consensus top pick from the 40 mocks, Sonny Styles\n\nThe top six edge rushers in the 40 mocks\n\nThe top four corners mocked to the Cowboys\n\nHere’s how often each player was taken at which spot in the 50 mocks:\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\n40 Mock Drafts – Summary Results\n\nThis table illustrates how the first round could likely play out for the Cowboys and the prospects they are interested in. One of the top two pass rushers, Bain or Bailey, is headed to Tennessee (#4) with the other one likely going to Washington (#7). Caleb Downs is a top 10 pick, and has a hard stop at Cincinnati (#10), though there is a slim chance he could fall to the Cowboys.\n\nLB Sonny Styles could be a consideration for Washington at #7, but they should happily bite on one of the falling pass rushers, so there’s a 70% (28 of 40 mocks) chance he’ll be available at #12 for the Cowboys. Barring Caleb Downs falling to them (12.5% chance), the Cowboys should have the option of picking between Styles (70%) or cornerbacks Mansoor Delane (37.5%) or Jermod McCoy (50%). Which of the two corners fall depends on what Miami does at #11.\n\nThe mocks seem to agree, for now, that pass rusher is the likely pick at #20 for the Cowboys, and depending on which player the Cowboys have their eyes on, they might even consider trading down from the 20th spot if they can find a team interested in moving up.\n\nOverall, that leaves the Cowboys with a lot of options, and if you boil it down to position combinations, here are the most frequent combinations among the 40 mocks:\n\nTo get a little more clarity on which player could be available for the Cowboys, you can look up the player ranking on your favorite big board, you can make up your own ranking, and you could even use a consensus big board to figure out such a ranking.\n\nOr we could look at the average draft position for each player based on the 40 mocks above, which is exactly what you’ll see in the table below. I included all LBs, CBs, edge rushers and safeties that were mocked to the Cowboys at least once, and added four more players to round things out (LB Arvell Reese, DE Rueben Bain, DE David Bailey, CB Avieon Terrell). To arrive at the average rank, I calculated the average across the 40 mocks, and where a player fell out of the Top 32, I used the 33th spot to calculate the average draft position.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nWithin the confines of this 40-mock data set, that gives the Cowboys plenty of options, with the big caveat that it’s still a long way to go to the draft.\n\nWhat would be your choice right now, based on these 40 mocks and the 21 prospects mocked to the Cowboys?",

    "fullText": "Devon Witherspoon made himself into a household name during Super Bowl 60, but his journey there was heavily influenced by one of Notre Dame’s newest coaches.\n\nWhen stepping foot in Champaign, IL, Devon Witherspoon was a zero-star according to 247Sports, a scrawny recruit who barely weighed in at 155-pounds. However, then Illinois defensive backs coach Aaron Henry immediately saw something in him that others missed. “I really believe the Good Lord just creates people who are a little bit different, I saw that the first day I got to campus. There was no denying that. He played so hard. He was not ducking contact,” he told FoxSports.\n\nHenry knew Witherspoon wasn’t ready for Big Ten physicality and focused on reshaping Devon’s body and refine his game. Devon never said no to any challenges put forth to him.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks ended up drafting Devon with the 5th overall pick in the NFL Draft. Three Pro Bowls later,  he has been arguably the heartbeat of the turnaround of the franchise who are now Super Bowl Champions.\n\nAs the new defensive back’s coach settles into South Bend, Aaron Henry will be able to walk into the locker room with immediate credibility. He was the man in charge when a zero-star corner worked his way from Champaign to Super Bowl champion.\n\n#NewProfilePic pic.twitter.com/WDKGlludfX\n\n— Aaron Henry (@AaronHenry7) February 7, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Aaron Henry brings an impressive resume with him to Notre Dame",

    "description": "Every starting quarterback from the 2025 season was ranked. So where did the Indianapolis Colts' three starters land?",
    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts had three different quarterbacks start games this past season. So, where did each of them land in NFL.com's starting quarterback rankings?\n\nNick Shook recently ranked all 63 quarterbacks who made a start last season. Based on their play in the regular season and playoffs, he then listed those quarterbacks from 1 to 63, placing them in tiers.\n\nMaking a big jump and landing in Tier 2 was Daniel Jones. For more on Jones' ranking and why Shook placed him there, you can find that here.\n\nBut what about Phillip Rivers and Riley Leonard?\n\nRivers came in at No. 36 and in Tier 5. A few others in this category included Kyler Murray, Joe Flacco, Spencer Rattler, and others.\n\n\"The 44-year-old proved he could still succeed with his brain; his arm, however, showed his age,\" Shook wrote.\n\nIn his three games, Rivers completed 63% of his passes for 544 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nThe Colts, unfortunately, did not win any of those games, but Rivers routinely put the offense into favorable looks pre-snap and helped that unit sustain drives and hang around in games, giving Indianapolis a chance.\n\nThe Colts needed stability at quarterback, and Rivers was able to provide that.\n\nLeonard, meanwhile, came in at No. 47 in these rankings and in Tier 6. Carson Wentz, Shedeur Sanders, Russell Wilson, and others were in this tier.\n\n\"Riley Leonard made one start and was shockingly effective, slinging the ball around the yard as if there was no tomorrow in a high-scoring loss to Houston,\" Shook wrote.\n\nAs Shook said, Leonard's start against Houston -- a very good defense -- in Week 18 was quite good. He completed 21-of-34 passes for 270 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.\n\nIt wasn't perfect by any means, but Leonard always found a way to respond. Could he be the Colts' backup quarterback in 2026?\n\nAnthony Richardson would appear in a couple of games before being placed on IR, but did not make any starts. So he did not qualify for Shook's rankings.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Every starting QB from 2025 ranked: Where do Colts QBs land?",

    "description": "Six quarterback prospects that the Packers could target in the 2026 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "In the last three drafts, Brian Gutekunst has selected two quarterbacks on Day 3. The Green Bay Packers general manager drafted Sean Clifford in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft and Michael Pratt in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nWith Jordan Love's backup, Malik Willis set to hit the open market and fetch a big payday, the Packers could be in the market to invest another Day 3 pick as they look to find a new backup for Love.\n\nLet's dive into some Day 3 quarterbacks who could be targets for the Packers during the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe winningest quarterback in college football history started his collegiate career at South Dakota State University, where he helped guide the Jackrabbits to two national championships. He has that \"it\" factor and he's not going to sink the ship. He'd keep Green Bay’s offense on track if he were forced into action. Much like Willis, the former SDSU quarterback can do damage with his legs. This past season at Iowa, he picked up 49 first downs with his legs. During his time in Brookings, he picked up 146 first downs on the ground and also had 60 runs of 10-plus yards.\n\nMark Gronowski is tough as nails. Tweaks his shoulder and still punches in the rushing touchdown to put Iowa up 24-16 at the half against Nebraska. pic.twitter.com/8f8Vn3tQJi\n\n— KCRG Sports (@KCRG_Sports) November 28, 2025\n\nPayton helped guide the Bison to a national championship during his first season as a starter. The southpaw quarterback threw for 2,719 yards and 16 touchdowns. Payton added 777 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. A former baseball player, Payton has the arm strength to rip throws into tight windows. He's able to navigate the rush and make accurate throws on the move. He has good acceleration when he gets outside the pocket and runs with the determination of a running back.\n\nNDSU QB Cole Payton is one of those draft, stash, & “develop” QB prospects you take mid draft. \n\nCrazy throw right here lol. Multiple reasons to buy in and see what you can mold him into. pic.twitter.com/RYnL21qVyW\n\n— Damian Parson💰 (@DP_NFL) February 6, 2026\n\nMrton has a quick setup and gets the ball out quickly. He sees the field well and understands where his outlets are. He's athletic in the pocket and comfortable making throws outside the pocket. He's got good zip on short and intermediate throws and shows good accuracy. Over the past two seasons, Morton threw for 5,900 yards and 47 touchdowns.\n\nBehren Morton is a productive and multi-faceted QB with elastic arm action, placing among nations leaders in categories of both efficiency and explosiveness@BehrenMorton also sits among the top of @TexasTechFB record books for career passing yds + total offense #WreckEm https://t.co/JHBsJ9lQ8t pic.twitter.com/cGLixeoPrd\n\n— Shane Coughlin (@Shane__Coughlin) January 10, 2026\n\nThe transfer from Boise State, Green passed for 5,868 yards and 34 touchdowns during his two seasons at Arkansas. Standing at 6-6 and 229 pounds, Green looks good off the bus and he has a rocket for an arm. Now it will be up to an NFL coaching staff to harness that natural arm strength and help him spray the ball accurately all over the field. Green can do damage with his legs, rushing for 1,379 yards and 16 touchdowns during his two seasons with the Razorbacks.\n\nA Texas native, Robertson started his collegiate career at Mississippi State before transferring to Baylor. This past season, Robertson threw for 3,681 yards and 31 touchdowns. He's a natural gunslinger with easy-looking arm talent. He has a quick reaction to get the ball out and on time.\n\nUSD's all-time leader in passing yards and completions is going to impress teams when he gets in front of them. He's a leader and an impressive individual off the field. At 6-5, 225 pounds, the USD quarterback is well built. He finished this past season with 2,876 yards and 26 touchdowns. The Minnesota native and Iowa State transfer has ties to Green Bay. Bouman's father, Todd Bouman, a long-time backup NFL quarterback, spent a minute with the Packers in 2006 as the team's backup quarterback after Aaron Rodgers got injured.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: 6 QB targets for Packers on Day 3 of 2026 NFL Draft",

    "description": "Could the Cowboys look to trade UP in the 2026 NFL Draft?",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NFL Draft quickly approaching, mock drafts and draft conversation are at their peak. For the Dallas Cowboys, who currently do not own a day two pick in the draft, many fans and analysts are looking at potential trade back scenarios from the 12th or 20th overall pick to pickup an additional second- or third-round pick on day two.\n\nBut Zach Wolchuk of 105.3 The Fan asked an interesting question on Twitter on Thursday that got the brain spinning. Could the Cowboys use their two first-round picks this year to move up in the draft, while also picking up a day two pick with their trade partner?\n\nIn Wolchuk’s scenario, he asked if people would be okay trading the 12th and 20th overall pick to the Cleveland Browns for the 6th and 39th overall pick? In most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent. But in this draft class that is substantially weaker than most, first round grades will likely max out at around 14. So realistically, the player the Cowboys would be drafting at 20 will more than likely have a second-round grade. If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nIn most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent.

If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nDallas trades the 12th and 20th (616 value points) overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft to Cleveland for the 6th and 39th (599 value points) overall pick. Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the sixth overall pick and edge rusher R Mason Thomas with the 39th overall pick.\n\nDallas trades the 12th, 20th, and 215th overall pick (617 value points) to the New Orleans for the 8th, 42nd, 73rd, and 189th (618 value points) overall pick. Using Pro Football Focus’ draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the eighth overall pick, cornerback Colton Hood with the 42nd overall pick, and linebacker Jacob Rodriguez with the 73rd overall pick.\n\nDallas offers the 12th, 20th, and 150th overall pick (629 value points) to Kansas City for the 9th and 74th overall pick and cornerback Trent McDuffie (619 value points). Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. with the ninth overall pick and safety Kamari Ramsey with the 74th overall pick.\n\nWith both the New York Giants and Washington Commanders picking inside the top 10 and unlikely to hand their divisional rival a blue chip talent, that leaves just a handful of spots that make sense for the Cowboys to consider. Given the value it would take to move into the top five, th Cowboys only have a few options to consider, but those couple options could give the Cowboys a chance at a player they would not be able to consider at 12, while also landing a quality player on day two and/or three.\n\nThere are only a few players likely to motivate the Cowboys to trade up in this draft. Ohio State safety Caleb Downs being one. Miami edge rusher Reuben Bain Jr. being one. But players like Texas Tech edge rusher David Bailey, LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane, and Ohio State linebacker Sonny Styles are also a few names to consider in this exercise.",

    "fullText": "Another NFL insider has connected the Indianapolis Colts to free agent defensive end Trey Hendrickson.\n\nThe NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe recently shared what he is hearing about Trey Hendrickson and the Cincinnati Bengals, and mentioned as a team to watch were the Colts.\n\n\"From what I understand, a team source told me, he figures it's unlikely for these two sides (Hendrickson and the Bengals) to reunite going into next season,\" Wolfe said. \"And so what does that mean? Do the Bengals let him go in free agency? Do they try to slap the franchise tag on him and trade him? A difficult decision for Cincy because their relationship has not been great in recent weeks.\n\nWolfe continued, \"And I'm told that if this deal does end up happening, free agency-wise, keep an eye on the Indianapolis Colts. It's a team that wants to be aggressive; they made the big splash move for Sauce Gardner mid-season. Lou Anarumo has a lot of familiarity with Trey Hendrickson. They just hired a D-line coach named Marion Hobby, who coached Trey Hendrickson for four years in Cincinnati.\n\n\"When they were all together, Lou, Marion, and Trey Hendrickson, they had 57 sacks in four seasons. Four Pro Bowl seasons. They're going to be aggressive in trying to get him if he does reach the market, or even if it's a sign and trade. It could be a big splash move for the Indianapolis Colts.\"\n\nTHE WOLFE OF BALL STREET: EARLY OFF-SEASON PREVIEW\n\n- Why Travis Hunter offense vs. defense usage will change a lot in 2026\n- Keep an eye on Trey Hendrickson and Indianapolis Colts\n- Browns could go with Shedeur Sanders and/or Deshaun Watson at QB, pass on drafting QB high again pic.twitter.com/1pQ60wmKm3\n\n— Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) February 14, 2026\n\nAs Wolfe alluded to with all the connections he made between the Colts and Hendrickson, Indianapolis' interest doesn't come as much of a surprise.\n\nFor one, more pass-rush help is needed. The Colts need to bolster their defensive end depth this offseason and need more pass-rush juice from that position group.\n\nIn addition to that, he will be very familiar with Lou Anarumo's defensive scheme after spending several seasons playing for him while the two were with the Bengals. Hendrickson's most productive seasons came with Anarumo as his defensive coordinator.\n\nAnd of note, the Colts have reportedly expressed interest in Hendrickson previously. Last offseason, when the Bengals were potentially trading Hendrickson, the Colts reportedly called Cincinnati to check in.\n\nAfter GM Chris Ballard was more aggressive in free agency last offseason, it sounds like the Colts plan to take a similar approach this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts free agency: Indianapolis again connected to Trey Hendrickson",

    "description": "George Pickens' future is up in the air at the time of writing, and that lends itself to all sorts of scenarios that could potentially play out.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys and George Pickens are getting set for a big offseason of contract talks, and you can bet it won't be smooth sailing.\n\nWith the Cowboys set to franchise Pickens, just as our own Mike Fisher reported back on November 27, that has led some to think the franchise could look to trade the Pro Bowl receiver and get something in return.\n\nIn truth, trading Pickens doesn't seem like a move that winning football teams make, and one could only imagine the backlash if the Cowboys trade Micah Parsons and then Pickens in back-to-back offseasons.\n\nAt the time of writing, we don't get the sense that Dallas wants to trade George, with Fish stating that some sections of people inside The Star would have an aneurysm if that were to happen.\n\nSo that tells you what the franchise thinks of Pickens.\n\nIt is here where NFL Network's Ian Rapoport offers his thoughts on what might entice Dallas to trade Pickens.\n\n“They’re going to franchise tag him, I just wonder what happens next,” Rapoport said. “He had a breakout year. These are the guys you don't let walk in free agency, and he's been great. What I really don't know is, are the Cowboys going to get an offer for Pickens that would allow them to trade him?\n\"They acquired him for a three, what if they franchise-tagged [Pickens], he gets the long-term deal that he wants, and they [Cowboys] get a two back? That's incredible value. I wonder if that's something that would be palatable for the Cowboys.\"\n\nIf I were Dallas' general manager, a second-round pick would not be enough for me to move on from Pickens. In truth, given what we saw George do, not only for the offense as a whole, but for individual players, I'm not sure I'm letting him go at all. Barring a godfather-like offer, of course.\n\nInstead, use the cap space and draft picks to rebuild the defense, while keeping the offense together.\n\nThis isn't the first time we have heard Dallas trading Pickens and getting a second-round pick back, and one thing we know about Rapoport is that he doesn't say things for the sake of it.\n\nSo there might be some merit to his line of thinking. He got that from somewhere.\n\nHow Jerry Jones approaches Pickens' contract will tell us a lot about where the owner's mind is regarding building a roster capable of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nThe offense with Pickens is more than capable of winning it all. It just needs a defense that can complement it.\n\nIf you trade away Pickens, you lose a huge part of what makes your offense great.\n\nAnd in the process, might throw away a chance at finally making that NFC Championship game.",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have made it clear that they would like to have Aaron Rodgers return for a second season in Pittsbugh, and a 22nd season in the NFL overall. The 42-year-old entered 2025 on a one-year deal with the intention of it being his final season. However, he kept the door open to return in 2026, and now the Steelers await his decision.\n\nIn terms of his performance in 2025, Rodgers threw 24 touchdowns to just seven interceptions and led the Steelers to an AFC North championship. It’s because of that year-long outing that Nick Shook of NFL Media ranked Rodgers as the No. 16 quarterback amongst all 63 to start a game in 2025.\n\n“Aaron Rodgers bested Father Time for much of 2025 and is the primary reason the Steelers even reached the playoffs,” Shook writes. “He produced some of his best games of the last three or four years and can definitely still fill a starting job somewhere in this league if he wants it.”\n\nRodgers was sandwiched between Brock Purdy (No. 15) and Baker Mayfield (No. 17).\n\nShould Rodgers return, he would reunite with his former head coach in Green Bay, Mike McCarthy.\n\nLet us know what you think in the comments. Be sure to bookmark Behind the Steel Curtain for all the latest news, breakdowns, and more!\n\nMason Rudolph sides with Joey Porter on Big Ben comments\n\nAntonio Brown defends Ben Roethlisberger after Joey Porter comments\n\nCam Heyward ends retirement speculation\n\nJoey Porter calls out Ben Roethlisberger for being a bad teammate",

    "description": "Part 3 of @wiltfongjr’s Bears roster turnover series focuses on the tight ends. Does Chicago have the best duo in the league?",
    "fullText": "Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson changed his offensive scheme from what he used in Detroit to better utilize his roster, but a few principles remained. He wants to run the ball, use play action, and get his tight ends involved. He also expects his tight ends to be versatile so that he can line them up anywhere on the field.\n\nIn 2025, the Bears used the sixth-highest percentage of 12 personnel (1 running back, 2 tight ends) in the NFL and the fifth-highest percentage of 13 personnel.\n\nJohnson’s offense will continue to evolve schematically, but I can’t see Ben deviating too far from his use of tight ends, which makes this an important position that needs quality depth.\n\nHere’s how the Bears’ tight end room currently shapes up.\n\nColston Loveland – Signed through 2028* – Loveland was one of the most dynamic rookies in the NFL, and this was after a slow start to the season. He flashed elite traits and appears primed to push for the Pro Bowl next season. His athleticism makes him a perfect “move” tight end, but he didn’t seem to mind lining up as the Y and blocking either. It’s easy to see why the Bears valued his skill set at 10 overall in the draft, and why his ceiling is even higher than that of a perennial Pro Bowler.\n\n*Bears have the fifth-year option for 2029.\n\nCole Kmet – Signed through 2027 – The Bears could save about $8 million if they move on from Kmet, but I think it’s more likely they rework his deal and sign him to an extension. Kmet has become a reliable in-line blocker, but he’s athletic enough to line up wide or in the backfield. He’ll likely never approach the 73 receptions he had in 2023, but he plays an important role in Johnson’s offense.\n\nLoveland and Kmet make up one of the best tight end duos in the NFL.\n\nDurham Smythe – Free agent – The 30-year-old veteran played in a quarter of the Bears’ offensive snaps (293) and the sixth-most snaps on special teams (230). I can see the Bears bringing him back on another one-year deal.\n\nThe next three players spent time on Chicago’s practice squad in 2025 and signed reserve/futures contracts.\n\nStephen Carlson – Signed through 2026 – Carlson has been with the Bears since 2023, but he’s only appeared in three games. He’s a solid veteran option to call up from the practice squad, but at 29 years old, he’s probably never going to crack a 53-man roster.\n\nNikola Kalinic – Signed through 2026 – The 29-year-old began his career in the CFL in 2019, and the Bears are his fourth NFL team since 2022. He played in two games for the Bears in 2025, making 3 special teams tackles.\n\nQadir Ismail – Signed through 2026 – The Bears are his fifth NFL team since being a Ravens UDFA in 2024. At 6’6”, 232 pounds, he’s a good athlete who started his collegiate career as a quarterback for Villanova and finished it as a wide receiver for Samford. His dad, Qadry, was a ten-year veteran in the NFL.\n\n2026 OUTLOOK – Assuming Kmet stays, the Bears won’t be addressing this position with big money in free agency or a high draft pick. However, some bottom of the depth chart competition should come from a UDFA or two.\n\nWhat do you think will happen at tight end this offseason?",

    "title": "The NFL Owners and Olympic Organizers in Epstein’s Inbox",
    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The sports media is ignoring the story, but wealthy sports figures are all over the Epstein files.\n\nChild sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein did not want to ingratiate himself only to billionaires. He wanted to spend time with people who shaped the culture, and as we saw during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show, nothing shapes the culture quite like the athletic industrial complex.\n\nThe website Front Office Sports went through the latest tranche of hurriedly redacted Epstein files, and it is shocking just how many NFL franchise owners are in these e-mails and assorted documents. They include—and this is a partial list—Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots; Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants and first cousin of Jessica Tisch, the current New York City police commissioner; Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins; Zygi Wilf, owner of the Minnesota Vikings; and Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons. There are more NFL owners in the Epstein files than attended the Super Bowl.\n\nDenials have already been sputtered, and the owners’ public relations machines are working in overdrive to deny that they are anything more than incidental acquaintances of Epstein. But how many were actually friends with Epstein is less relevant than the fact that everyone who associated with Epstein ignored and excused what was often happening in plain sight around them. And as hard as their PR mavens are working to deflect attention, the sports media is working just as hard to ignore it all.\n\nAfter all, who could possibly imagine that Kraft would be involved in anything illicit when it comes to exercising power over young women? ESPN has essentially not covered the sports figures involved with Epstein. There are scant few articles under the byline “ESPN News Services,” which draws from the Associated Press. There has been no investigative journalism or televised commentary on one of their yak-fests. When one considers that the NFL now owns a portion of ESPN, not to mention that the NFL is central to much of its programming, the network’s blasé attitude toward the story is odious.\n\nEven more damning in the released files is the repeated presence of LA 2028 Olympic chairman Casey Wasserman. He says he did nothing wrong, though two Los Angeles supervisors and two members of the City Council have now called for him to resign from his role with the Olympic organizing committee. LA City Council member Monica Rodriguez said that Wasserman represents “a threat to the integrity of the games.”\n\nWassermans’s clients are already leaving his talent agency in protest. Olympian Abby Wambach and popstar Chappell Roan have dropped Wasserman and are calling for him to step down from the agency that bears his name.\n\nOf course, by any moral marker, Wasserman should not be allowed within 500 yards of the Olympics (or a school). His e-mails to Epstein’s partner in child trafficking, Ghislaine Maxwell, date back 20 years and include unredacted tidbits like, “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” LA Mayor Karen Bass, however, has not joined the call for him to disappear from the 2028 Games, already being called “The Epstein Olympics.”\n\nThe unconvincing excuses for keeping Wasserman at his post include the difficulty of replacing the chair of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee at this late of a date, as well as his ability to raise corporate cash. After what the organizing committee described as an “internal investigation,” Wasserman, whose grandfather Lew Wasserman was one of Hollywood’s most powerful people, is staying on as chair. We need to fight to see every page of the Epstein files with only the names of the survivors and victims redacted—but that is not enough. To paraphrase journalist Nolan Higdon, it is becoming more and more difficult to “shield the architects of the second Gilded Age”—and they deserve no such protections.\n\nThe Epstein files have exposed that global elites have never been wealthier and more influential, but they’ve become drunk on power after decades of plunder. This second Gilded Age isn’t ending until the exposure is total and its criminal offenders are frog-marched out of the owners’ boxes.",

    "description": "Two NFL draft analysts have some good news for the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "Two of the best NFL draft analysts in the business, Daniel Jeremiah and Jordan Reid, have some good news for the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nAddressing cornerback and edge rusher are likely two items fairly high up on GM James Gladstone's offseason to-do list, and this year's draft class has a lot of talent at those positions.\n\nOn the edge rusher position, Jeremiah had this to say: \"If you need an edge rusher, this is a good draft to double up. The depth of the class is impressive. I've got 10 guys worthy of a spot in top 50 players. There's another layer of traitsy players beyond that group.\"\n\nThe Jaguars are positioned well here with Josh Hines-Allen and Travon Walker, but depth is a need. Beyond those two, the only other defensive ends under contract as of now are Danny Striggow and BJ Green.\n\nJacksonville could also use more steady pass-rush production from the rotational members of their defensive front.\n\nHere are the top 10 defensive ends in this year's draft from Mel Kiper's big board:\n\n1. Rueben Bain Jr., Miami (Fla.)2. Keldric Faulk, Auburn3. Zion Young, Missouri4. Akheem Mesidor, Miami (Fla.)5. Dani Dennis-Sutton, Penn State6. Caden Curry, Ohio State7. LT Overton, Alabama8. Jack Pyburn, LSU9. Max Llewellyn, Iowa10. Vincent Anthony Jr., Duke\n\nReid then had this to say about the cornerback and safety positions: \"This is a fantastic DB class. I have a huge cluster of 2nd and 3rd round grades at both safety and CB right now. The testing and on-field drills will be fun to watch at the Combine. Interested to see who separates from the group.\"\n\nAt cornerback, the Jaguars still have Jourdan Lewis, Jarrian Jones, and Travis Hunter, but Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome are free agents.\n\nThe level of need that Jacksonville has at this position will be dependent on what happens in free agency with Brown and Newsome, or whether an outside addition is made.\n\nSafety is less of a need, but perhaps is still a position that Gladstone could add to. Andrew Wingard is set to be a free agent, but on the roster are Eric Murray, Antonio Johnson, Caleb Ransaw, and Rayuan Lane.\n\nHere are Kiper's top cornerbacks in this year's draft:\n\n1. Jermod McCoy, Tennessee2. Mansoor Delane, LSU3. Avieon Terrell, Clemson4. Brandon Cisse, South Carolina5. Colton Hood, Tennessee6. D'Angelo Ponds, Indiana7. Chris Johnson, San Diego State8. Julian Neal, Arkansas9. Chandler Rivers, Duke10. Keionte Scott, Miami (Fla.)\n\nThe Jaguars do not have a first-round pick this year, but Jacksonville owns 11 picks in total, including four in the top 100. So the opportunity to address both edge rusher and cornerback with early-round picks does exist.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Lots of talent for Jaguars at 2 key positions of need",

    "fullText": "Multiplatinum rap star Earl “E-40” Stevens is taking one of his many monikers, “The Ambassador of the Bay,” to another level.\n\nStevens, a West Coast fixture in the hip-hop culture and a longtime supporter of the Bay Area, is joining the Oakland Roots and Oakland Soul ownership for the men’s and women’s professional soccer teams, respectively. He will join a large ownership group that includes former NFL running back Marshawn Lynch, Golden State Warriors guard Gary Payton II, Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd and musician Billie Joe Armstrong, lead singer of Green Day, which performed before Super Bowl 60 last Sunday.\n\n“Bringing my business acumen and sports fandom together as part of the Oakland Roots and Soul ownership group is truly special,” E-40 said in a statement. “This move is about investing in a sport that connects the world. I look forward to working closely with the ownership team to continue to amplify the fan experience while delivering successful results on the field.”\n\nE-40 will perform at the Oakland Roots season opener against New Mexico United on March 14 in the USL Championship. The Soul plays in the USL W League.\n\nHe’s often seen at sporting events in the Bay Area. E-40 has been spotted courtside at Golden State Warriors games, and he is a vocal San Francisco 49ers supporter.

However, a trading party takes on $34M this season in salary–unless Arizona takes on some of that salary.\n\nThen there is also the idea of compensation. That $34M figure will likely influence trade compensation. If the Cardinals were to eat some of that money, it could reasonably be expected that they would get a better return in a trade.\n\nMORE: George Kittle sends message to 49ers, NFL over wild conspiracy theory\n\nThe Cardinals want to get this done quickly, as Murray’s base salary becomes guaranteed four days after the 2026 new league year date. They could potentially post-June 1 release him, but that would leave no return.\n\nMurray has been linked to multiple teams, including the Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, and even the Cleveland Browns. The Colts are uncertain of Daniel Jones’ recovery timeline, the Jets will likely move on from Fields, and the Browns are always looking for a quarterback.\n\nOne thing feels almost certain: Murray will be in a different uniform only a few years after signing a hefty contract extension.

Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen shared the RB2 role, while Jack Kiser and Rayuan Lane were core special teams contributors.\n\nJonah Monheim stepped in at center on a few occasions when needed.\n\nUndrafted rookies BJ Green and Danny Striggow also made the 53-man roster and went from only helping on special teams to filling rotational roles on defense.\n\nIn terms of Year 1 from this rookie class, the Jaguars didn't get a ton of high-end contributions. However, Jacksonville's ability to get steady contributions from Day 3 picks and UDFAs is a good sign for the future, Gladstone said, and the strong processes that Jacksonville has in place.\n\n\"At this point, there's plenty of room for optimism,\" Gladstone said of the draft class.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: Jaguars 2025 draft class receives lackluster grade from analyst",

    "fullText": "The ink isn’t even dry, and the hangovers are barely over for the Seattle Seahawks. They won the Super Bowl. They should be able to enjoy it, right? We know how the NFL works, though. This is and 365 day a 365-day-a-year enterprise, and the grind never stops.\n\nAs the Seahawks look towards the 2026 season, and let’s be honest, that’s already happening, one of the biggest questions is the future of Cooper Kupp.\n\nMORE: NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break\n\nFrom a regular-season perspective, Kupp’s first season in Seattle wasn’t great. He finished with just 47 catches for 593 yards and two touchdowns. Kupp wasn’t close to being the same dominating player that he was in his prime with the Los Angeles Rams. While part of that was due to the sheer dominance and overwhelming success of Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the Seattle running game, it was hard not to take note of that.\n\nWith Smith-Njigba dealing with a concussion in the Super Bowl, Kupp stepped up and caught six of 12 targets for 61 yards. It closed out a strong postseason in which he caught 15 passes for 157 yards and a touchdown in three games.\n\nBut with the veteran entering his age-33 season, Seattle has a tough decision to make on Kupp.\n\nHe has a $17.47 million cap hit next season and that comes with $8 million of dead money. While the Seahawks are currently fifth in available cap space at $73 million, releasing Kupp would create a substantial windfall. Seattle is fortunate that Sam Darnold is on an affordable contract for a quarterback, but Kenneth Walker is a free agent, and they can’t ignore the status of their defense.\n\nRashid Shaheed is also a free agent, which means that the Seahawks are thin at the receiver position. But is Kupp the best use of their capital and roster space? He showed this season that he’s not capable of being a true number two receiver, and he’s overpaid to be a third or fourth option. If Kupp is still in Seattle in 2026, it will likely be because his contract was re-done.\n\nOLYMPICS: Norway skier goes viral after displaying insane Winter Olympics speed\n\nSUPER BOWL: Ranking the last 10 NFL Super Bowl champions\n\nMLB: Texas Rangers’ Nolan Ryan jersey giveaway is a bloody mess\n\nMEDIA: Photos of potential suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance released by FBI\n\nVIRAL: Norwegian Olympics star makes stunning girlfriend admission after winning bronze medal\n\nThe post Seahawks have a tough decision to make on star player after Super Bowl win appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "If you build it, they will come?\n\nSome Iowa state senators introduced a bill this week that would expand the state's major economic growth attraction program, creating financial incentives that could lure an NFL team seeking to build a stadium in the Hawkeye State.\n\nTheir target? The Chicago Bears.\n\n\"After years of Bears fans seeking refuge across the Mississippi River from the incompetence, corruption and punitive tax and regulatory climate in the state of Illinois, it is time for the team to join their fans on the west side of the river,\" Republican Scott Webster, one of the legislation's sponsors said in a statement.\n\n\"Iowa can offer the Bears everything they need to build a world-class facility, tax certainty and the public infrastructure they need in a state led by common-sense conservatives.\"\n\nThe recruitment pitch didn't end there.\n\n\"While Illinois and Indiana squabble over this issue, we are ready to get off the sidelines and into the game,\" Kerry Gruenhagen, another senator sponsoring the bill, said in a statement. \"Bringing an NFL team to Iowa would attract jobs, tourism and fans to our state and give us the opportunity to showcase what Iowa really has to offer. Iowans have dedicated themselves to our college sports teams, and we're ready to attract a professional team to our great state.\"\n\nWhile Iowa was the stage for \"Field of Dreams,\" it isn't home to any major professional sports franchises.\n\nOne of the NFL's original franchises, born in 1920 as the Decatur Staleys, the Bears have been seeking a new stadium for years. Tenants of historic Soldier Field, the league's smallest venue in terms of capacity (61,500) in downtown Chicago since 1971, the Bears had planned to move to suburban Arlington Heights, where they own a 326-acre tract of land that used to be the site of Arlington International Racecourse.\n\nBut team president Kevin Warren wrote in a letter to season ticket-holders in December that an inability to get assistance from the state of Illinois in offsetting infrastructure costs around the proposed project had led the team to consider alternatives. The team has committed to paying for construction of a new stadium itself.\n\n\"We have not asked for state taxpayer dollars to build the stadium at Arlington Park. We asked only for a commitment to essential local infrastructure (roads, utilities, and site improvements) which is more than typical for projects of this size,\" Warren wrote. \"Additionally, we sought reasonable property tax certainty to secure financing. We listened to state leadership and relied on their direction and guidance, yet our efforts have been met with no legislative partnership.\n\n\"We have been told directly by State leadership, our project will not be a priority in 2026.\"\n\nWarren specifically cited Northwest Indiana as a potential locale to build a new stadium.\n\nHowever, Illinois officials continue working to find a solution that would keep the Bears, a beloved team and one on the rise after winning the NFC North for the first time since 2018, in the Chicagoland area, where they've played since 1921.\n\n\"There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,\" Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday.\n\n\"But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the Legislature.\"\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Chicago Bears to Iowa?

    "fullText": "Top snubs from the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs we close the book on the 2025 season, the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine will give us our first taste of football for the offseason. The football world will descend upon Indianapolis for a week of interviews, drills, and athletic testing destined to shape the late-winter discourse.\n\nOver 300 prospects will be invited to the event, hoping to boost their draft stocks ahead of the pro day circuit. Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss won't be among them.\n\nFear not, Chambliss was not left off the list for character concerns or bureaucratic oversight. Rather, it's an indictment of the NFL's expectations for his pending hearing, which is challenging the NCAA's decision to deny his waiver for eligibility. It seems like Chambliss is headed back to school, allowing us to focus on the prospects who were snubbed from the Scouting Combine.\n\nBlack, after six college seasons, will play the majority of his rookie season at 25 years old. That developmental path (and his age-adjusted production) isn't kind to his draft stock, and it may be the biggest reason he isn't headed to Indianapolis.\n\nHowever, Black put himself on NFL radars in 2025, playing a significant role on a championship-winning offense. Black ran for 1,040 yards and 10 scores this past season. He boasts NFL-level athleticism with the speed to hit home runs, experience with zone and gap runs, and enough size to check the box.\n\nIn a world where Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Georgia Tech's Haynes King are getting Combine invites, it becomes difficult to gather why Kaliakmanis won't be among the participants in Indianapolis.\n\nKaliakmanis was incredibly productive for Rutgers, ranking eighth in EPA and seventh in EPA/DB -- between Pavia and King -- in 2025. He's not a lock to get drafted, but Kaliakmanis looks the part of a mid-Day 3 pick and a prototypical backup quarterback at the next level. With a big arm and multiple seasons of starting experience, it's surprising that he hasn't gotten more love.\n\nTyren Montgomery, WR, John Carroll\n\nPerhaps the most notable admission from the Combine festivities is John Carroll's Tyren Montgomery. His wild ride to Mobile culminated in a strong Senior Bowl performance, proving that a Division III standout could play with the best upperclassmen the Division I could offer.\n\nAn excellent athlete at 6'1\", 190 pounds, Carroll seems like a prospect the NFL would want to see get as many reps as possible during the pre-draft process. Given that nearly 50 receivers were invited to the event, Montgomery should have received an invitation.\n\nFoster stood out on my preseason board as a potential low-end starter headlining the Kansas offensive line. All he's done in the time since is continue to win in pass protection.\n\nFoster has SEC pedigree after three seasons in the middle of Texas A&M's line, then he took a step forward against Big 12 competition. With adequate measurables and a track record of success, his median projection still looks like a solid backup center.\n\nTerion Stewart, RB, Virginia Tech\n\nStewart won't be in Indianapolis because of his production. Just 469 yards in his first year of Power 4 play isn't all that impressive, and nine career receptions is laughably little work through the air.\n\nMORE: Meet the three contenders for RB2 in the 2026 NFL Draft\n\nHowever, Stewart has intriguing fundamentals, fun burst, and elite contact balance, perhaps making him a role player at the next level. It will be an uphill climb to raise his stock during the pre-draft process, but his film made a worthy case for Indianapolis. I expect him to be a priority free agent in April, much like Raheim Sanders.\n\nHaynes shares a lot of similarities with Wake Forest's Demond Claiborne, who rightfully rose up boards in a bad running back class. The Georgia Tech back is undersized and limited to a rotational role at the next level. Still, Haynes has the athleticism, footwork, and instincts to make plays on Sundays.\n\nHaynes is a former receiver who stands out as a natural pass-catcher out of the backfield. As an integral piece of Georgia Tech's run-heavy attack, an inefficient season shouldn't have cost him the chance to show out at the Scouting Combine.\n\nFive prospects who make sense for Klint Kubiak's Las Vegas Raiders\n\nFive winners from the 2026 Senior Bowl\n\nSeattle Seahawks Super Bowl mock draft\n\nPatriots mock draft: How New England can get Drake Maye the help he needs",

    "fullText": "Maxx Crosby’s future remains up in the air as we speak. The star defensive end didn’t end the 2025 NFL season on the best of terms with the Las Vegas Raiders. The AFC West team shut him down for the final two weeks of the regular season, which caused issues in their relationships.\n\nAs the days go by, it seems that Crosby is closer to the exit door. He has been mentioned as a potential trade target for Super Bowl contenders, including the defending champions Seattle Seahawks, as well as other strong teams such as the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s edition of ESPN’s “Get Up,” former NFL player Jason McCourty floated the idea of the Raiders shipping Crosby to Texas and landing one of the best wide receivers in the league.\n\n“If I’m the Raiders, why not go out and trade Maxx Crosby to the Dallas Cowboys?” He questioned. “You franchise tag George Pickens, you don’t work on a long-term deal. You trade him to the Raiders, get Crosby in exchange.\n\n“Now you just beefed up your defensive line. New coordinator coming over. Maxx Crosby is going to make everybody on the defensive side of the ball better, and of top of that, have you watched the way Maxx Crosby plays the game of football? He plays every single play of the game.”\n\nMaxx Crosby for George Pickens?\n\n@JasonMcCourty lays out a potential Cowboys-Raiders deal pic.twitter.com/Ng0umUEQLj\n\n— Get Up (@GetUpESPN) February 11, 2026\n\nMcCourty added that landing George Pickens would put Fernando Mendoza in a position to succeed with the Raiders. The future No. 1 overall pick won’t have much to work with if he joined the Raiders today, and Pickens is coming off his best season to date.\n\nAccording to Jason LaCanfora of Sports Boom, Maxx Crosby made a final decision on his future with the Raiders. The defensive end reportedly informed minority owner Tom Brady that he won’t suit up for the team again.\n\n“He told (Raiders owner and future Hall of Fame quarterback) Tom Brady he will never play for the Raiders again,” LaCanfora wrote.\n\nHe noted that the same happened with Myles Garrett last season, and he agreed to return to the Cleveland Browns. It remains to be seen if Crosby has a similar path this offseason.\n\nOLYMPICS: Norway skier goes viral after displaying insane Winter Olympics speed\n\nSUPER BOWL: Ranking the last 10 NFL Super Bowl champions\n\nMLB: Texas Rangers’ Nolan Ryan jersey giveaway is a bloody mess\n\nMEDIA: Photos of potential suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance released by FBI\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break\n\nVIRAL: Norwegian Olympics star makes stunning girlfriend admission after winning bronze medal\n\nThe post ESPN analyst proposes Cowboys trade star WR for Maxx Crosby appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "A recent report confirms what has been reported for weeks. The Bears will not receive comp picks for Ian Cunningham leaving to be Atlanta’s GM.",
    "fullText": "According to Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, who emailed the NFL for confirmation, the Chicago Bears will not receive compensatory draft picks for losing assistant general manager Ian Cunningham to the Atlanta Falcons, where he will serve as their general manager.\n\n“The policy for receiving picks pertains to the head coach or the primary football executive,” the NFL told PFT on Tuesday via email. “The primary football executive position was filled by Matt Ryan.”\n\nThis was the expectation all along, since Matt Ryan was hired to be the Falcons’ president of football, a position Cunningham also interviewed for. Had Cunningham been hired for that job, which is Atlanta’s primary football executive, then the Bears would have been awarded two third-round draft picks by virtue of the Rooney Rule.\n\nWhat brought this subject up again was Ryan’s recent declaration that Cunningham will take the lead on roster decisions.\n\nAfter being asked if he would be actively involved in the draft and free agency, Ryan said, “Ian is in charge of that space.” Ryan went on to say that he’s looking forward to learning about the draft process because he’s never even sat in a draft meeting, and that he “has a lot to learn.“\n\nHe reiterated that Cunningham is “driving this boat, and he’s the one that’s leading us moving forward,” but Ryan will be involved and helping out in any way he can. “This is Ian’s regular season right now; he is in it, and he is driving the ship for us.”\n\nEvery team has a primary and a secondary football executive position on file with the league, and no matter what that’s called from team to team, or what the responsibilities for each of those are, there’s no getting around the 1-2 front office hierarchy that each franchise has set up.",

    "fullText": "While Indiana officials play up their efforts to lure the Chicago Bears across the border for a new stadium, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday that he and his staff have made “progress” to incentivize the football team to stay in Illinois.\n\nThe governor’s comments come as Pritzker’s January calendar shows he had two scheduled conversations with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell while Goodell was in Chicago for the Bears-Packers playoff game on Jan. 10.\n\nDuring his time here for the game, Goodell joined Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren and Chair George McCaskey on a tour of the Arlington Heights site the team owns, and sites in northwest Indiana, including one near Wolf Lake in Hammond.\n\nThe first conversation between the governor and Goodell was a scheduled half-hour phone call on Jan. 9, while the second was a half-hour discussion between the two on Jan. 12, according to the governor’s calendar entries. The governor’s office on Monday declined to comment on how the conversations went or what was said.\n\nBut the scheduled talks underscore that efforts surrounding the Bears stadium have not gone dormant, even though the team said in December it was exploring a move to northwest Indiana after negotiations with Pritzker and his Democratic allies in the Illinois General Assembly hit a lull.\n\nThe key sticking points in Illinois have been over how the state would legislatively or financially aid the team in its desire to build a stadium in Chicago’s northwest suburbs. In particular, topics have evolved around assistance for infrastructure around a proposed Arlington Heights stadium, property tax certainty for the team and payment of debt for the Soldier Field renovations done more than 20 years ago at the team’s behest.\n\nSources familiar with the discussions between the Bears and state of Illinois officials said both sides have been meeting regularly since early December to hammer out legislation for this spring’s legislative session in Springfield. The talks have been in line with public infrastructure improvements for or around the Bears stadium site in Arlington Heights and so-called megaprojects legislation that would make it easier for the Bears to negotiate with local governments over property taxes, sources said. In addition, the governor’s office has sought for the Bears to implement measures to make games more affordable, the sources said.\n\nSince the Bears’ December announcement that opened the door to a stadium across the border, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun has said his administration was “working hard” to attract the Bears and has pushed a bill to establish a state authority to “acquire, construct, equip, own, lease, and finance” a sports stadium.\n\nBut on Monday, Pritzker, during an unrelated news conference in southwest Illinois, cast an optimistic tone when he described Illinois officials’ relationship with the Bears these days.\n\n“There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,” he said in Belleville, where he and other lawmakers talked about a bond program meant to spur economic development in Illinois communities. “But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the legislature.”\n\nThe Tribune reported that in late December, Pritzker’s office signed a new $25,000 contract with an outside attorney to continue advising the administration in negotiations with the Bears through the end of June.\n\nPritzker on Monday also reiterated his position on the Bears’ quest for state incentives that he does not want taxpayer money paying for the stadium itself but would be willing to use state money to help the team with infrastructure funding, which generally includes improvements to roads and other transportation-related initiatives.\n\n“We are helping businesses build infrastructure, for example, which they would need, and other things that are sort of available, again, to any business that is growing or building something new in the state of Illinois that’s putting people to work,” the governor said. “You know, those are normal incentives, and that’s what I would expect that we will end up with the Bears, you know, depending on where it goes.”\n\nA team consultant estimated last year that infrastructure improvements from near Illinois Route 53 and changes to a nearby Metra train line could cost more than $850 million in public funds. What’s more, the Bears would likely need megaproject legislation that would allow them to negotiate with local governments over property tax bills.\n\nAnother issue for Bears officials is more than $500 million in outstanding public debt from the controversial 2003 Soldier Field renovation, a tab currently covered by city hotel taxes and, when that falls short, by Chicago’s share of state income taxes. The Bears’ lease at Soldier Field expires in 2033, but it can be broken early with a penalty, and the team says it will take three years to build its new stadium.\n\nBut even with the debt paid off, that alone might not be enough to satisfy state lawmakers who represent swaths of Chicago and are reluctant to incentivize the team to move out of the city limits, even if it’s to Arlington Heights.\n\nIn Springfield a few weeks ago, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, a Democrat from Hillside, sent out a survey to other House Democrats about where they stand on the Bears issue. The results of that survey were not available.\n\nAs for whether he’s taking the Bears’ interest in relocating to Indiana seriously, Pritzker said Monday, “I never take anything as if it’s a bluff.”\n\n“I mean, I’m always concerned about making sure that we’re attracting businesses or keeping businesses in the state of Illinois,” he said. “So we’re in consistent conversation with the Chicago Bears — have been, by the way, for, I don’t know, a year and a half or two years. And specifically, I think there’s a real possibility that many of the things that we put on the table to work with the Bears on are things that they’re willing to do to stay in the state of Illinois.”",

Skattebo made headlines after he did a backflip in the end zone during a Sept. 28 game against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\"I mean, I had to get used to it, but it was different, but I've known that he's been like this, so he's been a superstar since I met him,\" Rodriguez says, of watching Skattebo build up a viral presence on and off the field.\n\n\"It's been awesome,\" Skattebo shares. \"With everything that's been coming my way, I've been taking it in and being able to navigate it in the right way and it's been great.\"\n\nSkattebo has become known for nonstop backflips, an aggressive playing style and running into telephone poles.\n\nSkattebo's mother, Becky Skattebo, previously gave a glimpse into the untraditional tactics her 23-year-old son would practice in his younger years in hopes of going pro during an ESPN interview.\n\n\"He would put his brother's shoulder pads on and he would run into telephone poles,\" Becky told the outlet. \"Once he got onto the field, it was no surprise the punishment he inflicted on his own body and everybody else.\"\n\nSkattebo and Rodriguez first met in college, when Rodriguez was a part of the Hornets cheerleading squad.\n\nSince then, she's been a staunch supporter of Skattebo. When he was selected by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, she commemorated the occasion with a post on Instagram showing the two celebrating.\n\n“I love supporting you, keep making us proud,\" she wrote. \"❤️ time to head back east, go @nygiants!”\n\nShe was there to see the Giants play the Los Angeles Chargers in September 2025, and she sometimes wears her boyfriend’s custom SKATT chain when watching him play.\n\nWhen Skattebo moved east to play for the Giants, Rodriguez joined him. In the summer of 2025, Rodriguez posted a photo of the N.Y.C. skyline on her Instagram Stories, tagging Skattebo and Hoboken, N.J., alongside a house emoji.",

    "fullText": "Had the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl on Sunday, their 2026 home showdown with the Denver Broncos would have been a perfect choice for the NFL's season opener.\n\nSuch a scenario is off the board after the Seattle Seahawks easily took care of business with a 29-13 win over New England in Super Bowl LX. That means Seattle is now set to host the NFL's 2026 season opener.\n\nThe Seahawks are among the Broncos' 2026 opponents, but that game is scheduled to be played in Denver. So the league will have Seattle open the season at Lumen Field against one of their home opponents.\n\nThe defending Super Bowl champion opening the season on the road is not unprecedented, but it is uncommon. Following the 2012 season, the Broncos hosted the Baltimore Ravens in Week 1 of the 2013 season, but that was due to unique circumstances.\n\nThe Ravens had a scheduling conflict with the MLB's Baltimore Orioles, so they were not able to play at home in Week 1, and the league instead scheduled a rematch with the team they knocked out of the 2012 playoffs. Denver won 49-27. The Seahawks don't have a scheduling conflict, so they will open the season at home.\n\nSeattle will also host the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers in 2026, but those teams are set to face off in Australia, likely in Week 1, this season.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Seahawks play Broncos in 2026, but not in season opener",

    "fullText": "Every NFL franchise dreams of reaching the Super Bowl, but for some teams the road to football’s biggest stage has been paved with more heartbreak than triumph. The list of most Super Bowl losses highlights organizations that have repeatedly come close to the ultimate prize only to fall short on the grandest stage. While losses can be tough for fans to swallow, they also reflect sustained excellence — getting to the championship game is itself a rare and remarkable achievement that only a handful of teams enjoy. From perennial contenders to decades-long underdogs, these franchises have forged identities around both drama and resilience.\n\nThe Patriots’ six Super Bowl losses are almost paradoxical when paired with their dynasty status. They reached the Super Bowl so often that disappointment became the price of sustained dominance. Several of those losses were razor-thin, last-minute heartbreaks that still sting New England fans. Ultimately, the volume of losses reflects just how frequently the Patriots lived on the NFL’s biggest stage.\n\nDenver’s Super Bowl losses include some of the most lopsided defeats in big-game history, which made them especially painful. For years, those blowouts defined the franchise more than its wins. Still, the Broncos kept returning, refusing to fade from relevance. Their later championships softened the scars, but those early losses remain unforgettable chapters.\n\nThe Bills’ four Super Bowl losses are unique — all came consecutively, an unmatched run of dominance and disappointment. That early-1990s team was powerful enough to rule the AFC but just couldn’t finish the job. Despite the heartbreak, Buffalo’s fanbase takes pride in that era’s consistency and grit. Those losses became part of the franchise’s identity rather than its undoing.\n\nMinnesota’s four Super Bowl defeats came during an era when the Vikings were perennial contenders. The “Purple People Eaters” defense struck fear across the league, yet the Lombardi Trophy always slipped away. That legacy of being close—but not close enough—has followed the franchise for decades. For Vikings fans, Super Bowl loss is both history and heartbreak.\n\nThe 49ers are better known for perfection in Super Bowls than failure, which makes their three losses stand out. Each defeat came during transitional moments between dominant eras. Rather than defining the franchise, those losses highlighted how high the standard was in San Francisco. Even in defeat, the 49ers were almost always contenders.\n\nAll three of Cincinnati’s Super Bowl losses came against the same opponent, giving the defeats an almost cruel symmetry. The Bengals were competitive in each appearance, often falling just short late. Those losses reinforced the narrative of a franchise knocking on the door but unable to break through. Recent success has reignited belief that history doesn’t have to repeat itself.\n\nPhiladelphia’s Super Bowl losses were emotional, hard-fought games that mirrored the city’s blue-collar identity. Each defeat deepened the hunger of one of the NFL’s most passionate fanbases. Those losses made eventual victory feel earned rather than inevitable. They’re reminders of how long the climb was before reaching the summit.\n\nThe Rams’ Super Bowl losses span multiple cities and eras, reflecting a franchise constantly reinventing itself. Some defeats were defensive struggles, others offensive collapses, but all were defining moments. Each loss forced organizational change and evolution. That adaptability eventually helped lead them back to championship success.\n\nMiami’s Super Bowl losses are often overshadowed by their perfect season and early dominance. Still, those defeats show how even elite teams aren’t immune to regression and disappointment. The Dolphins experienced both sides of football immortality within a short span. Their losses serve as a reminder that dynasties are fragile.\n\nDallas’ three Super Bowl losses sit quietly behind a louder legacy of championships. Each defeat came during eras of immense expectation and national spotlight. The losses didn’t diminish the brand, but they did humanize it. For “America’s Team,” even defeat became part of the mythology.\n\nThe Chiefs’ Super Bowl losses represent the bridge between old heartbreak and modern dominance. Before their recent success, Kansas City spent decades chasing relevance on the biggest stage. Those losses made the later championships feel transformational rather than routine. They’re proof that patience can eventually pay off in spectacular fashion.\n\nLooking across the history of the Super Bowl, patterns of near-misses and redemption emerge just as vividly as the glory of victory. The teams with the most losses have all carved out unique narratives — some marked by eras of dominance that ended in narrow defeat, others by periods of heartbreak that galvanized their fanbases. Yet for every loss on this list, there are lessons learned, legacies built, and the promise of future triumphs still to come. In the end, what matters as much as the losses are the stories of perseverance and passion that define these franchises and their supporters.\n\nThe post Teams with most losses in the Super Bowl appeared first on The Big Lead.",

I'm so proud.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nDuring five years as defensive co-ordinator of the London Warriors, Durde was able to earn coaching internships with the Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons, before the latter made him Britain's first full-time NFL coach in 2018.\n\nHe progressed through roles with Atlanta and Dallas before Seattle's new head coach Mike Macdonald made Durde his defensive co-ordinator in 2024.\n\n'AD', as he is known at the Seahawks, has since helped create a defence he describes as \"fast, physical, ball-hungry, and they work as a collective\".\n\n\"AD is an absolute game-changer for us,\" said Macdonald on Monday. \"It's not just an incredible story that got him to this point, it's him as a football mind, a football coach.\n\n\"He's someone that has really brought us together, and the way that our defence plays inspired football is a great tribute to how AD operates, and what he brings to our football team and our organisation. I'm really happy for AD.\n\n\"He's just an absolute beast and he's so much fun to work with. He's right there alongside, building this whole thing. It's been a special journey.\"\n\nThe Seahawks dominated the New England Patriots to win 29-13 on Sunday, but Durde has not just become a Super Bowl champion, he has helped forge a defence that will go down in NFL folklore.\n\nSeattle's defence has been dubbed 'the Dark Side' and produced a performance long-time NFL analyst Cris Collinsworth said was \"as good as I have ever seen\".\n\n\"That's pretty cool,\" said Durde. \"But we have to give credit to the players. They made a commitment, they wanted to be the best in the world, and we got the outcome we wanted.\"\n\nWas this the ultimate Super Bowl redemption story?\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nAs he finished speaking to reporters after Sunday's game, with a British flag around his waist, Durde admitted he felt emotional.\n\n\"I'm trying to hold it back, I just want to get out of here,\" he joked.\n\nNFL analyst Phoebe Schecter used to coach with Durde on the NFL's International Player Pathway programme and shared a moment with him on the field.\n\n\"As someone that's known him for quite some time, [I know] he doesn't like to be emotional, but he couldn't help himself,\" she said.\n\n\"The moment is so big, the achievement is so big, and he knows that he's made history.\"\n\nDurde has spoken about being the best he can be, to make it easier for others to follow his lead, and Schecter is excited about what Durde's story means for the international game.\n\n\"Aden's great because he's not just thinking about himself in the moment,\" Schecter said.\n\n\"For years he's been thinking about other people, building the NFL Academy and the International Player Pathway programme. He's constantly sending that elevator back down.\n\n\"I think he knows how much it means, not just to the UK but to the rest of the international space, [for people] to think 'I could be that person one day, I could coach in the NFL'.\"\n\nWhile working with NFL UK, Durde shared an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora and they founded the IPP programme.\n\n\"I remember Osi telling me about [Durde] back in the day and then followed his journey,\" said NFL executive Peter O'Reilly.\n\n\"How talented he is and how well respected he is by his players, and what a great person he is, that just makes him someone you want to root for.\"\n\nThe IPP helped Britain's Efe Obada and Australia's Jordan Mailata get into the NFL, and former rugby league player Mailata won a Super Bowl last year with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"Whether it's coaching or playing, having those role models, those local heroes, where someone in the UK can look up and say 'OK, there's a path for me', is really important - like last year for a young Australian looking at Jordan Mailata,\" O'Reilly added.\n\n\"The IPP is also a great breeding ground for international coaches. You want that mix of coaches, and we've been in engaged in how we build that pipeline, making sure programmes for coaching development are not just US-based but global.\"\n\nAnd Durde has challenged others to take a shot, saying: \"You just have to set goals and understand there's always people out there that do believe in you. You've just got to push forward and go for what you believe in. That's what life's about.\"\n\nWhat's next for NFL as latest international games confirmed?\n\nOnce Durde joined Seattle's on-field celebrations at Levi's Stadium, he was joined by his wife Kate and their two sons.\n\nTheir eldest son, Kane Doyle-Durde, now works as a scout for the Dallas Cowboys and their youngest Dylan is working in coaching.\n\n\"We just hugged, we were grateful for the moment,\" said Durde.\n\n\"A lot of people have sacrificed a lot for me to be sitting here, but you don't see all the people around me that helped me get here. I'm very grateful for them.\"\n\nThey include many back in the UK, who Durde aims to catch up with now the NFL season is over.\n\n\"I've got to get back to London, get this mayhem out of the way,\" he laughed. \"I need to go home.\"\n\nIn particular, Durde is looking forward to seeing his close friend Marvin Allen, one of a few Britons to own a Super Bowl ring having been on the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice squad when they became NFL champions in 2009.\n\nDurde had two interviews for head-coach positions during the current hiring cycle and - although he is set to remain with Seattle next season - Allen is confident he will become the NFL's first overseas head coach.\n\n\"Aden has come from obscurity to take an American sport by storm,\" he said.\n\n\"One day NFL owners will say 'this guy that's comes from nowhere to win a Super Bowl, let's give that guy a go'.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Winning a Super Bowl is the highest mark of success for an NFL head coach. Only a small group of active coaches can say they have done it. Some built long careers around steady success. Others reached the top early in their coaching journey. Each of these coaches shaped their teams in a different way. Their titles show strong leadership, smart planning, and the ability to win on the biggest stage. Here is a look at the active Super Bowl-winning head coaches.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LX)\n\nMike Macdonald is the newest coach to join this list. He led the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl LX win in 2026. Seattle defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to earn its second title in franchise history.\n\nHis defensive game plan was the key to the victory. Seattle’s defense controlled the Patriots’ offense from start to finish. Pressure came from all angles and forced mistakes.\n\nThat championship made Macdonald one of the youngest head coaches to win a Super Bowl. The win also proved his defensive style can work at the highest level. Seattle now looks to build around that success for future seasons.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLVII with Baltimore Ravens)\n\nJohn Harbaugh won his Super Bowl with the Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII. That victory helped define his long career in Baltimore. He became known as a coach who could win with strong defense and smart special teams play.\n\nHis teams stayed competitive through many roster changes. New players came in and old stars moved on. Success continued because Harbaugh adjusted his approach to fit his personnel.\n\nHowever, following a disappointing 2025 regular season, Harbaugh was fired from Balti\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLIV)\n\nSean Payton earned his Super Bowl title with the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV. His offense stood out for its creativity and balance. Play calling became a major part of his reputation.\n\nLater, he moved to the Denver Broncos to begin a new chapter. Experience gives him an edge in building a culture of discipline and preparation.\n\nOffensive ideas from Payton influenced many coaches around the league. His teams often play with speed and confidence. Denver now relies on that knowledge to return to championship form.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LVI)\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a title in Super Bowl LVI. He became known for modern offensive design and clear communication with his players.\n\nYouth never slowed him down. Playoff runs became common under his leadership. Los Angeles stayed competitive in a tough division because of his planning and play structure.\n\nEach season shows his ability to adapt. Changes at quarterback and defense never stopped his teams from finding ways to win. Many see him as one of the smartest minds in football today.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LIX)\n\nNick Sirianni reached the top with the Eagles during a time when offense ruled the league. His coaching focused on balance and teamwork.\n\nRoster development became one of his strengths. Young players improved quickly under his system. Veterans also fit well into his plans.\n\nPhiladelphia built a strong identity with him in charge. Toughness and energy defined the team’s style. A Bowl win confirmed his place among the league’s top young coaches.\n\nAndy Reid leads this list with three Super Bowl titles. His record shows long-term excellence and steady results. Kansas City became a powerhouse under his leadership.\n\nOffensive creativity sets him apart. Play designs keep defenses guessing every season. Quarterbacks thrive in his system because it allows freedom and structure at the same time.\n\nYears of playoff success place him among the best in NFL history. Consistency defines his career more than any single season. Few active coaches match his résumé.\n\nActive Super Bowl-winning head coaches represent the highest level of achievement in the NFL. Each one reached the top through different paths. Some relied on defense. Others built great offenses. Experience and adaptability connect them all. Their championships show what strong leadership can do for a team. As seasons continue, these coaches will try to add more titles and strengthen their legacy.\n\nThe post Active Super Bowl winning head coaches in the NFL appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold leading the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl glory could just be the greatest redemption story ever in the NFL. We take a closer look.",
    "fullText": "The Sam Darnold redemption story is quite something - from being rated as one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL to Super Bowl champion.\n\nIt's a tale of never giving up, of character, unwavering self-belief and persistence, but also a warning for teams not to write a quarterback off too soon.\n\nAs youngsters being drafted into the NFL are at the mercy of circumstance, not every team will fit every rookie and the sport's history is littered with college stars deemed not good enough.\n\nThey often bounce around from team to team, as Darnold did, but never has one plumbed the depths before managing to rise up and claim the sport's ultimate prize in the ultimate NFL redemption story.\n\nSeahawks beat Patriots to win Super Bowl 60 with crushing defensive display - as it happened\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to win Super Bowl\n\nSo how bad was Darnold? Well, the numbers were not great, as after being drafted in 2018 he spent three seasons with the New York Jets and two with the Carolina Panthers - during which time he ranked bottom or near the bottom in several areas.\n\nWins were the main one - just 21 of them in five seasons - but categories like passer rating and completion percentage were the worst of any quarterback during that time.\n\nAs a third pick in the draft he was ridiculed for his \"seeing ghosts\" comment as he struggled, and labelled a bust, but now he's getting fitted for a Super Bowl ring it's clear he was only part of the problem.\n\nFellow Jets quarterbacks Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith and Zach Wilson also all finished dead last in passer rating in their first three seasons with the team. Notice a theme?\n\nThat's a quirk of the NFL Draft system, the best players go to the worst teams, and while some could just be having an off season so can build for success, some have serious issues.\n\nAfter Sunday, Darnold has now won 39 games since leaving New York, including serving two years as a back-up - the Jets have won just 26.\n\nThe Panthers have won 15 to Darnold's 31 since leaving Carolina and even the Vikings and 49ers can't match his wins since he departed.\n\nPeople forget that at just 21 he was the youngest NFL starting quarterback since the 1970 merger - perhaps the young man was just in the wrong place after all.\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\n\"Quarterbacks need tonnes of help to allow you to go show how great you can be. If you do not get that help, you are limited in how great you can be,\" said former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and three-time Super Bowl champion Steve Young.\n\n\"And there are not 32 places in the league today that can give you that help.\"\n\nYoung knows when a team is not a good fit, as he was drafted by a poor Tampa Bay squad and won three games in two seasons before leaving to join the 49ers and eventually becoming a Hall of Fame member.\n\nIronically enough it was a largely forgotten season in San Francisco that also provided the catalyst for Darnold to launch the comeback of all comebacks.\n\n\"I didn't play great football the first few years of my career,\" Darnold admitted after the Super Bowl. \"Then I come here to San Francisco and I think because of that year I was able to learn a tonne. I was able to kind of learn and go to Minnesota and play good football there. I was able to come to Seattle and do the same.\"\n\nWorking in a fully functioning franchise, learning from coach Kyle Shanahan and serving as back-up to Brock Purdy in a Super Bowl saw Darnold head to Minnesota better equipped to succeed.\n\nThe irony of returning to Levi's Stadium for his crowning glory was not lost on him.\n\nA stellar season in Minnesota came after he replaced injured rookie JJ McCarthy, but then more irony in the Vikings opting to stick with the quarterback they drafted saw Darnold move on again.\n\nHe left after massive career highs of 14 wins, over 4,000 yards and 35 touchdowns, but still with question marks after a play-off capitulation against the Rams.\n\nOnce again, he had a point to prove.\n\nQuarterbacks grab all the headlines, for good or bad, but they simply cannot do it all by themselves in this ultimate team sport.\n\nTom Brady regularly had, and needed, a top-10 defence on his side to win Super Bowls, while Patrick Mahomes lost two of them because he was soundly beaten up by opposing defences.\n\nIn Seattle, Darnold found the perfect storm of a team on the up and a defensive head coach assembling a crack unit that would go on to dominate the NFL, needing just a solid quarterback to steer the offence.\n\nHaving the league's leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Super Bowl MVP running back Kenneth Walker also helped, and plenty will say Darnold did not have to do much.\n\nHe became the first quarterback to enjoy successive 14-win seasons with two different teams - only Brady had managed it with one - but still there were questions as he led the league in turnovers, giving the ball away 20 times.\n\nAround 80% of play-off games are won by teams with the fewest turnovers. In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nDarnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.\n\nThe response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.\n\nHe answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.\n\nWas it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.\n\nNo quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.\n\nLuck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.\n\nNone have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it. His redemption story really is one for the ages.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures",

    "fullText": "The NFL inevitably will expand the regular season to 18 games. It's a matter of \"when\" not \"if.\"\n\nAs to the when, it could still happen the season after next.\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the situation, the lingering absence of a specific date for Super Bowl LXII in Atlanta is tied directly to the possibility of the season expanding for the 2027 season. With 17 games, the game would be played most likely on Sunday, February 13. With 18 games, it would slide to Sunday, February 20.\n\nAnd if 18 games comes with a second bye, the NFL likely would have to start the 2027 season on Labor Day weekend. That hasn't happened since 2001.\n\nLast Monday, Commissioner Roger Goodell said it's \"not a given\" that the regular-season will expand. The next day, interim NFL Players Association executive director David White said the players have \"no appetite\" for adding another game.\n\nOnce the NFLPA hires a permanent executive director, the league apparently plans to make a move on moving the season to 18. And the door for 18 by 2027 will remain open until Super Bowl LXII locks into February 13, 2028.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 season is complete after a thrilling Super Bowl. Now the work begins for all 32 teams to retool their roster and prepare for a potential playoff appearance next season. After an offensive coordinator and passing game coordinator change, the Eagles' roster will likely undergo further changes. The Birds have 21 players who'll test the restricted or unrestricted free-agent market during the 2026 NFL offseason. Several key factors include a pending contract extension for Jalen Carter and the contract status for star tight end Dallas Goedert.\n\nReed Blankenship is one of the biggest names on the list, and the defense could look drastically different with Nakobe Dean entering the final year of his rookie deal.\n\nWith the off-season officially underway in Philadelphia, we're looking at nine players who seem likely to depart.\n\nThe 27-year-old Uche played in 12 games and recorded 1 sack.\n\nOjulari saw action in three games before spending the bulk of the season on IR.\n\nThe 2022 sixth-round pick just finished his fourth season in the NFL, and likely played his last game in Philadelphia. A Former college teammate of Jalen Hurts at Oklahoma, eaching the end of his rookie contract. Calcaterra played in 62 games with 22 starts.\n\nA former Commanders first-round pick, Dotson spent two unproductive seasons with the Eagles, playing in 34 games and recording 37 catches on 69 targets for 478 yards and one regular-season touchdown.\n\nA versatile and solid lineman, the 29-year-old played 363 snaps at center and guard, allowing two sacks.\n\nThe Eagles acquired Howell via trade in August, making him the third-string quarterback. He didn't play a single game with the Eagles this season, but could certainly return.\n\nOkoronkwo played in just one game this season and landed on IR.\n\nDillon signed a one-year deal with Philadelphia after missing last season with a neck injury, but things didn't work out. The veteran running back lost his role when the Eagles brought in Tank Bigsby via trade. Dillon, 27, ended up with just 12 rushing attempts for 60 yards this season.\n\nThe Eagles signed Epps to their practice squad at the start of the season and eventually promoted him to the active roster. When rookie Drew Mukuba fractured his ankle, Epps regained his starting role at safety next to Blankenship.\n\nThe 30-year-old veteran signed a one-year deal with the Eagles in the offseason and improved for Vic Fangio as the season went on, outplaying Kelee Ringo and Jakorian Bennett.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Free Agency: 9 Eagles players who seem likely to depart",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump reacted forcefully to Super Bowl 60, calling for immediate change after what he described as a damaging moment for the NFL.\n\nFollowing the game, the former US president focused his criticism on the halftime show and quickly expanded his comments to include league policy.\n\nTrump shared his reaction in a post published by TrumpTruthOnX, responding directly to Bad Bunny’s halftime performance.\n\nHe wrote, “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, ever! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of success, creativity, or excellence.\n\n“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children who are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”\n\nThe comments were uncompromising and immediate. Trump framed the halftime show not as a matter of taste, but as a failure to reflect what he believes the Super Bowl should represent.\n\nAs has often been the case, Trump’s reaction quickly spread across social media, becoming part of the wider debate surrounding the NFL’s entertainment choices.\n\nTrump’s post did not stop at the halftime show. He also used the moment to call out a specific NFL rule change.\n\nHe continued, “This ‘show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the best Stock Market and 401(k)s in history!\n\n“There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a halftime show and watch, it will get great reviews from the fake news media, because they haven’t got a clue of what is going on in the real world, and, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new kickoff rule. Make America great again!”\n\nThe mention of the kickoff rule stood out. Rather than limiting his response to entertainment, Trump shifted attention to on-field changes introduced by the league.\n\nHis criticism suggested frustration with what he sees as unnecessary adjustments to the game itself.\n\nThe NFL’s revised kickoff rule, which was introduced in 2024, has already divided fans, with some praising the improvements and others arguing it removes excitement.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 fallout continues, the former president’s comments ensured the halftime show debate expanded beyond music.\n\nIt became, once again, a flashpoint for how sport, culture, and politics intersect on the biggest stage.\n\nDonald Trump goes off on ‘worst ever’ Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show\n\nImane Khelif has a brutal reminder for Donald Trump, names only way she will ‘respect’ the US President\n\nWho Donald Trump picked as Super Bowl LX winners between Patriots and Seahawks",

Walker became the first running back since Terrell Davis in 1998 to win Super Bowl MVP, a rare honor in today’s quarterback-driven NFL.\n\nIn his post-game interview, Walker described the achievement as almost unbelievable, saying it was “just a dream come true” because many players never even reach the Super Bowl, let alone win MVP.\n\nBut beyond the individual accolade, Walker highlighted the adversities the Seahawks overcame this season:\n\nHe thanked his teammates and emphasized the team’s resilience, noting, “We went through a lot of adversity this season, but we came together, and we stuck together, and this is what we got.”\n\nWalker shouldered a heavier workload down the stretch after Seattle’s offense lost running back Zach Charbonnet to a torn ACL in the playoffs, proving his ability to lead even through tough circumstances.\n\nWalker’s MVP performance not only helped deliver a Super Bowl title but also snapped a decades-long drought for running backs winning the MVP award, underscoring both how well he played and how meaningful the achievement was for his position.\n\nThe post Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III Recalls Seahawks’ Adversities After Winning What Saquon Barkley Couldn’t Last Year appeared first on The SportsRush.",

On one side is Sam Darnold, a veteran whose career has shifted gears over the past two seasons. On the other is Drake Maye, the second-year quarterback who’s brought some life back to a franchise that got used to yearly Super Bowl trips under Tom Brady.\n\nThe stakes are clear, and the energy inside Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara shows it.

One specific item has blown up online.\n\nMORE: NFL WAGs turn heads on Sports Illustrated swimsuit covers ahead of Super Bowl 60\n\nBefore kickoff, a burger priced at $180 started making the rounds on social media.

Most people online cannot get past the price, calling it another case of Super Bowl excess.\n\nOne fan wrote, “I’d rather bite my thumb off and eat it rather than paying 180 for that. There is no doubts that the burger might be tasty, but for 180, nah. I’m expecting wagyu beef for that sum.”\n\nAnother commented, “At that price they can keep it\n\nalways eat somewhere other than the stadium!”\n\nThe most expensive concession item at Super Bowl LX is a $180 beef shank burger that feeds 4 people\n\n— Front Office Sports (@FOS) February 8, 2026\n\nSomeone else wrote, “Mortgage just for a burger.”\n\nAnother fan added, “The majority of the people that would buy these aren’t sitting in a regular seat. They’ll be in a luxury box.”\n\nOne other fan chimed in, “Stop trying to normalize expensive concessions. I could doordash everything you see here, with a full 3 course meal and it’d cost half the price.”\n\nOne more fan wrote, “I know they need to make some margin but the markup on this is astronomical, even for stadium food.”\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\n\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NFL fans can’t believe the price of this Super Bowl 60 burger appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen the Seattle Seahawks finally turn the page to the offseason, they'll have a big decision to make on running back Kenneth Walker.\n\nThat's because the former second-round pick is a pending free agent after spending all four of his NFL seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nHere's a look at who much Walker is expected to make in free agency.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Walker is estimated to land a four-year, $33.5 million deal in free agency, which is realistic for a few reasons.\n\nFor starters, Walker will be one of the best running backs available in free agency and should draw plenty of interest. Also, Walker has only helped his contract demands with a big showing in the playoffs.\n\nWhat will hurt Walker is the fact that he isn't the most complete back. He's OK as a pass-catcher and struggles in pass protection, so he won't be getting top-of-the-market money.\n\nThe good news for the Seahawks is they are loaded with cap space this offseason, so they'll have no issue re-signing Walker if that's the route they want to go.\n\nCardinals trade rumor could lead to deal with Steelers, Vikings or Browns\n\nAaron Rodgers career update is great news for Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n49ers trade rumor is crushing blow to possible deal with Vikings, Falcons\n\nMaxx Crosby isn't ruling out interesting career change down the line\n\nTravis Kelce rumor offers update on Chiefs superstar's future plans\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor is good news for Pats, Eagles, Cowboys",

    "fullText": "NFL legendary wide receiver Randy Moss didn’t mince words when addressing Pro Football Hall of Fame voters snubbing his former coach, Bill Belichick, from the Hall. Belichick’s name appeared on the ballot for the first time this year, but he will have to wait one more year to get inducted into the HOF.\n\nThe decision sparked plenty of reactions from former NFL players. Things got worse after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft also didn’t make it. During a Sunday appearance on ESPN’s “NFL Countdown,” Moss sent a strong message to the voters and the people who put them there.

    "fullText": "Sam Darnold has been facing challenges all throughout his time playing football since his days at San Clemente (Calif.). Now the former California high school football star will get his chance on the grandest stage of them all, Super Bowl LX, to show why he’s one of the best to have ever come out of the Golden State.\n\nThrough Darnold’s sophomore and junior seasons with the Tritons, the Super Bowl starting quarterback had seen minimal time on the field at San Clemente, totaling 748 yards and seven touchdowns. It would be Darnold’s senior year where the signal caller would blossom into his own before heading off to become a USC Trojan.\n\nDuring his senior campaign with the Tritons, Darnold had himself a strong season and ended up completing 213-of-314 passes for 2,985 yards and 39 touchdowns. The four-star prospect showed off his wheels on the ground, rushing for 785 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nAfter his high school playing days at San Clemente, Darnold was already committed to USC, making his decision during the summer of 2014 heading into his senior season and would head into a crowded quarterback room with the Trojans.\n\nPlaying two seasons at USC with a redshirt freshman campaign, the 6-foot-3, 221-pound passer completing 549-of-846 passes for 7,229 yards and 57 touchdowns before being selected as the No. 3 pick of the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Jets.\n\nNow heading into Sunday’s Super Bowl matchup with the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Darnold has a chance one more time to prove the naysayers wrong and overcoming one more challenge in his path.\n\n“Sam Darnold was sort of a late bloomer (in high school). USC had their quarterback room all set and it was gonna go from (Cody) Kessler to Ricky Town. A lot of schools early on wanted Sam to play tight end. The issue at that time he wasn’t doing a lot of camps or 7-on-7. First time I saw him at Mission Viejo 7-on-7 tournament and he was outstanding. He made all the the grows and was superb. The way his recruitment went, he to a camp at USC and Clay Helton was the HC at the time. The staff said they had to go after him at the time after seeing him. Oregon, Duke were also after him during the recruitment him. Darnold and his dad went to a lot of USC games. I think that’s a testament to his fortitude. Is it surprising, certainly. Just knowing him and his HC. Knowing he’s a tough kid. He was walking into a very tough QB at USC and he stayed resilient.” – Rivals National Recruiting reporter Adam Gorney\n\nSan Clemente High School, located in the coastal town of San Clemente, California, serves around 3,000 students from the city and surrounding areas, including Capistrano Beach and San Juan Capistrano. Established in 1964, the school is part of the Capistrano Unified School District and boasts a robust athletics program with a strong community presence under the motto “One Town, One Team.” The Tritons are recognized for their competitive spirit across various sports disciplines.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "description": "Photos show how crews prepare Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta for NFL game day in just 18 hours.",
    "fullText": "To prepare the field for an NFL game in less than 18 hours, crews have to strip and repaint the field, clean 2 million square feet of stadium space, and fire up thousands of meals in crowded kitchens, all in a matter of hours.\n\nThe first step in clearing the field and prepping for it to be painted with the Falcons' logo is collecting roughly 5 million pieces of confetti launched from confetti cannons.\n\nCleanup crews use rakes, leaf blowers, and utility vehicles fitted with large nets to collect every last piece — even the smallest piece of debris can interfere with repainting the turf.\n\nThe paint removal process takes around one to two hours to complete.\n\nTo speed things up, P-Rex machines spray a cleaning solution onto painted logos and use spinning brushes and a vacuum to remove the paint.\n\nThe process is surprisingly precise. Too many chemicals can soak the turf, and too much pressure can permanently damage the field.\n\nEvery area has to be cleared of waste, including the private suites, locker rooms, kitchens, and stadium bowl seating.\n\nIn the seating bowl, workers hand-pick everything from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to food containers and pom-poms, with each person assigned a specific type of waste to speed up sorting.\n\nAfter trash is collected from the stands, power-washing crews race behind the waste-collecting crews, scrubbing away spills and sticky residue before the next crowd arrives.\n\nEven though waste is pre-sorted, each bag still has to be inspected.\n\nThe goal: recycle or compost 96% of all waste generated during the event.\n\nOnce paint is removed from the field, the turf must completely dry before repainting can begin.\n\nGrounds crews use this small window of time to prep stencils and get ready to tackle the \"hot areas\" of the field — the center logo and the end zones — which are the most time-consuming.\n\nThe logo is hand-painted using spraying machines that ensure accuracy.\n\nCrews have to pay special attention to the sidelines and end zones to ensure everything is up to code before kickoff.\n\nAbout 100 cooks prepare different menus for concessions, suites, catering, and eight all-inclusive clubs — some serving up to 1,000 people.\n\nAt this game, the stadium's food team sold more than 25,000 hot dogs, 10,000 slices of pizza, and over 5,000 pounds of wings.\n\nThe menu changes for every event, and food is largely prepared in a central kitchen and distributed to multiple secondary kitchens throughout the stadium.\n\nExecutive chef Matt Cooper told Business Insider that having detailed boards allows him to keep track of his massive team and ensure everything runs smoothly.\n\n\"This is the magic behind everything we do,\" he said. \"We have all the chefs, all the supervisors, junior sous chefs, all the cooks, and we're able to kind of move the pieces around. It's a big kitchen, a lot of space, and I love being able to kind of visualize and see the whole team.\"\n\nAt the same time, club spaces are stocked with fruit and sandwich trays, employees place fan giveaway items on every seat inside the stadium, and excitement builds for kickoff.\n\nLights flash, cameras roll, fans cheer, and players take the field, with most of the stadium's attendees oblivious to the overnight operation that made it all happen.\n\nWhen the final whistle blows, it's mere hours before employees at Mercedes-Benz Stadium start planning for the next event.",

    "description": "Iowa State's \"Big Citrus\" offers size and surprising athleticism. Could Domonique Orange be the run-stuffing force the Green Bay Packers desperately need?",
    "fullText": "It may feel a bit too early to start thinking about the 2026 NFL Draft, but mock draft season will be upon us before you know it. In fact, for many fans, mock draft season started the minute the Green Bay Packers' 2025 season ended.\n\nA lot is going to happen between now and April 23rd, when the draft kicks off in Pittsburgh. Right now, the Packers don't have a first-round pick, and they'll start their selections with pick No. 52, which is in the second round.\n\nNot having a first-rounder in the 2026 and 2027 NFL Drafts was part of the price the Packers paid for getting Micah Parsons. They gave a lot to get a lot back in return, and that's just part of the reality general manager Brian Gutekunst will have to work with unless he's able to swing another trade and somehow get back into the first round.\n\nSo who should the Packers target in Round 2 and beyond? There are going to be a ton of names thrown around and many of them will be great picks.\n\nEarlier this week, we focused on Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker.\n\nNow, let's talk about Iowa State defensive lineman Domonique Orange:\n\nOrange may have the best nickname in the 2026 NFL Draft, and you can absolutely make the case that he has one of the best nicknames of all time.\n\nThey call him \"Big Citrus\", and there's a reason for that. Orange checks in at 6-foot-4, 325 pounds.\n\nHe's a big dude, and he knows what to do with his size.\n\nOrange is a run-stuffer, without a doubt. He's the guy you put at nose-tackle or one technique and ask him to take up a double team. The thing about him, though, is that he's surprisingly athletic for his size.\n\nNobody is going to confuse him with Devonte Wyatt, who is actually a great pass-rusher for being 6-foot-3, 304 pounds, but \"Big Citrus\" has the quick-twitch to be able to shoot the gap, and he's good at using his hands to get blockers off him.\n\nDomonique Orange (95) aligned head up on the RT before penetrating and eating the RB\n\nBig Citrus with a healthy dose of vitamin C-eek and destroy. Get it? Thank you for your time\n\n pic.twitter.com/lybgr8haI9\n\n— Anthony Cover 1 (@Pro__Ant) February 6, 2026\n\nThe Packers struggled a bit against the run this past season, averaging 117.7 yards per game given up on the ground.\n\nAdding Orange to this offensive line would go a long way. Speaking of Wyatt, he should be healthy by the start of the 2026 season, so new defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon would be able to pair him and Orange together on the inside. Both of those players will demand double-teams, but so does Micah Parsons on the edge.\n\nOrange is projected as a third-round pick but the Packers would absolutely be justified taking him in the second round. Even if they don't select him at No. 52, there's a chance he's still there at pick No. 84 in the third round, but if they like him, they may want to jump on him while they're able to in round two.\n\nPackersRoundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "description": "The daughter of NFL Hall of Famer Tom Mack reflects on growing up with a legendary player who balanced football, work, and family.",
    "fullText": "On the occasion of my father's 82nd birthday, I called him to wish him well. As we chatted, I told him about a social media post shared by his former team, the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nMy dad doesn't pay attention to social media, so he wouldn't know that the post had garnered hundreds of likes and comments. Many fans wished him a happy birthday, while others recalled his skill on the field and their favorite memories of watching him play.\n\n\"That's neat,\" my father said in his understated manner. I could hear the smile in his voice.\n\nMy father, Tom Mack, was an offensive lineman for the Los Angeles Rams from 1966 through 1978. He played in 184 consecutive games over 13 seasons, served as team captain, and was named to 11 Pro Bowls. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nBut to me, he's just my dad. He walks his dog, attends church, and shops at Walmart. People usually don't recognize him as one of the game's all-time greats.\n\nWhen I was growing up as the daughter of an NFL player in the 1970s, there were definitely some perks, like the trip our family took to Hawaii when my dad participated in a celebrity rodeo. After home games, my two sisters and I, along with my mom, would greet our dad outside his locker room at the Los Angeles Coliseum. My sisters and I would run around with our autograph books getting signatures from teammates, including Merlin Olsen and Jack Youngblood.\n\nI admit I'm a bit jealous of today's NFL kids, who seem to get on the field regularly. I only stepped on the field with my dad once, for the Pro Bowl in 1979, his final game.\n\nWhile going on the field was rare, seeing him on television was another perk of having an NFL dad, especially back when there were so few channels. He was interviewed on the news and appeared in local commercials. It was especially exciting when he guest-starred on the popular series \"Six Million Dollar Man,\" playing a bad guy in a slow-motion football match against Lee Majors as Steve Austin.\n\nIt wasn't all glamorous, though. Even though he played 13 seasons, his entire career occurred before the advent of cable TV and huge salaries.\n\nIn fact, my dad and his teammates worked other jobs during the offseason. Some of them sold cars or real estate, while my dad worked as a mechanical engineer for a global engineering and construction company.\n\nAs a kid, I didn't think of my dad as someone with two careers. I just knew he went to work. What mattered to me was that he ate dinner with us and came to my soccer games and ballet recitals.\n\nOther people, however, seemed far more interested in what he didn't have.\n\nMy sisters and I were athletic and enjoyed playing sports when women's sports were in their infancy. People asked us constantly if we had any brothers. Whenever I replied no, I was struck by how many strangers asked, \"Didn't your dad want sons?\"\n\nMy dad never made me feel like he wanted sons, and my mom echoed that. He had grown up in the shadow of his own father, who played Major League Baseball, and knew the weight that came with that legacy. He always told me he was happy to raise girls without the pressure to follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhen he retired at the end of the 1978 NFL season, he went to work full-time as an engineer, and my family left the football world behind. Surprisingly, we moved across the country more for his engineering career than for football.\n\nWhen he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999, it was fun to revisit his career. Each summer, he returns to Canton, Ohio, for enshrinement weekend, reconnecting with teammates and other legends. The Rams organization treats him well, too, checking in and welcoming him back to games.\n\nI love it when fans recognize him. When it does, fans get stars in their eyes. From the time I was a little girl until now, I've witnessed my dad remain humble and gracious with every fan he meets.\n\nI think of him not as one of the NFL's greatest players, but simply as my dad. He modeled hard work and humility with a dash of humor, remaining competitive even off the field — he never lost a board game to my sisters or me until we could beat him on our own merit. He took me fishing and camping, taught me to drive a stick shift, and walked me down the aisle.\n\nHe may have been a legendary football player, but I'd argue he's an even greater dad.",
