    "fullText": "Former Tyrone goalkeeper Lorcan Quinn says he is taking inspiration from New Orleans Saints kicker Charlie Smyth as he chases his own dream of playing in the NFL.\n\nSmyth, 24, started six games for the Saints - converting 12 of his 16 field goal attempts - after being elevated to their active roster in November and signing a three-year deal last month.\n\nQuinn, who was part of Tyrone's 2021 All-Ireland winning panel, is hoping to follow in Smyth's footsteps after transferring from Marshall University in West Virginia to Alabama's prestigious football programme for his second year in college football.\n\n\"I look up to Charlie even though he's probably a couple of months younger than I am,\" Quinn told BBC Sport NI's Thomas Niblock.\n\n\"He's inspiring loads of lads here and I'm sure a lot of lads are dreaming of doing the same thing as Charlie's doing. He's made it possible to even think about doing this because before Charlie, it wasn't possible.\n\n\"He's opened a doorway there obviously with the help of Tadhg [Leader]. He's just shown that it is possible when you have the leg talent and put the work in, you could end up doing something like that.\"",

    "description": "Two of the NFL's least successful teams are working with multiple first round picks in 2026. How could Cleveland and New York fix things?",
    "fullText": "For three quarters of the NFL, the 2026 offseason has begun. That means Super Bowl hopes and dreams have been replaced by scouting reports and salary cap debates.\n\nThat means, for 24 teams, it's draft season.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Draft is modest when it comes to quarterback talent but still loaded with players who can change the fortunes of a franchise. Pass rushers, wideouts, cornerbacks and reinforcements on both sides of the trenches are waiting to hear their names called in April. Let's see who fits where and make some educated guesses.\n\nPlease note this draft was completed before Monday night's Wild Card game between the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers, so draft position among the top 24 picks was determined using the betting spread of that game (a projected three-point Texans win).\n\nGeno Smith can be kept for about $8 million more than his dead cap number. While he might be a useful veteran mentor, he's also the guy who flipped off his home fans in his first year in Las Vegas, so... Aidan O'Connell will probably be the experienced (well, kinda) hand that turns things over to a polished rookie next August.\n\nMendoza's elite downfield accuracy means he'll dazzle when it comes to advanced stats like completion percentage over expected (CPOE). He balances pinpoint throws with strong, quick decision making and enough athleticism to keep defenses wary of his run game. While he lacks elite physical traits, you can't argue with his outcomes. Las Vegas needs a winner -- ideally immediately given how quickly it's cycled through head coaches. Mendoza has been wrecking shop at INDIANA.\n\nMoore has more physical tools in his box than Mendoza, but he's not as polished as the Heisman Trophy winner. Still, it's not difficult to see how a quick release and the arm strength to whip a deep shot through a rapidly closing window make him a tantalizing NFL prospect.\n\nThe Oregon star can break down under pressure and will need some time to acclimate to the NFL. Picking up a wideout with the pick acquired from the Colts in the Sauce Gardner trade (or, later on, the second round acquired from the Cowboys in the Quinnen Williams trade) could find him some badly needed receiving help to ease his transition.\n\nJosh Sweat was one of the few bright spots in Arizona last fall, racking up a career-high 12 sacks in his first season with the club. Only one other Cardinal had more than two, and that was 39-year-old Calais Campbell.\n\nArizona needs help just about everywhere but tight end. Reese's versatility can help him plug holes in a few places along the defense but most notably as a pass rusher. He had 10 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in his All-American 2025.\n\nTexas Tech stud David Bailey is worth a look here, but Bain's playoff performance is too fresh to ignore. The 6-foot-3, 275 pound edge rushing monster had 5.5 tackles for loss and four sacks in the Hurricanes' first two CFP games, setting the stage for a push even further up draft boards.\n\nHis get-off and closing speed hit like a series of small explosions, making him an absolute nightmare to block and a haunting presence to escape. The Titans badly need an influx of talent; Bain may be the best raw prospect of 2026.\n\nTate's ability to create space with savvy route running, strong hands and upper crust ball tracking would be a rising tide for New York's cache of young skill players. Malik Nabers' double-teams would drop. Cam Skattebo (and Tyrone Tracy, if he ever re-enters the circle of trust) would face fewer stacked boxes.\n\nAnd Jaxson Dart, importantly, would have more options downfield that don't require him to lower his shoulder and run face-first into the concussion protocol (he probably still will. He just won't *have* to). Wideout isn't the team's biggest need, but it could be the catalyst that revives an inefficient offense.\n\nThe Browns allowed pressure on a league-high 46.5 percent of their dropbacks -- four percent higher than the second-worst Chargers, who were missing their starting tackles most of the season. Four different linemen who played at least 69 percent of the team's snaps are set for free agency. Spending room is sparse, in large part thanks to Deshaun Watson, formerly accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct and what the NFL described as \"predatory behavior,\" and his albatross contract.\n\nThe easiest fix is to find a dynamic starter on a rookie deal. Here, Cleveland has its choice. Fano gets the nod thanks to his absurd power and athleticism at 6-foot-6 and 305 pounds. That athleticism boosts his recovery when beaten, which will be an asset when squaring up with rookie mistakes and elite edge rushers.\n\nTerry McLaurin is locked in, but Jayden Daniels' targets get iffy after that. Deebo Samuel is a pending free agent. So is Zach Ertz, who is coming off a season-ending ACL tear. Daniels badly needs a boost after backsliding in 2025 due to injury and lackluster play.\n\nTyson is a jetpack. The Arizona State star is good at just about everything, but shines hardest when it comes to breaking off cornerbacks at the top of his route and creating the space for clutch pickups. Sticky hands and elite recognition make him a dynamic closer on 50/50 balls as well -- though he could stand to bulk up a bit to withstand the rigors of a 17-game season.\n\nNeeds: CB, IOL, EDGE, LB, RB, WR\n\nNew Orleans could have used Tate or Tyson. Taking a player like Makai Lemon or Denzel Boston could be a bit of a reach here. Good news! The Saints also need help at another position that would boost Tyler Shough after a promising rookie season.\n\nEnter Love, who'd be a boon to a tailback rotation that got below-average returns from Alvin Kamara and Devin Neal last fall. His value as a runner (nearly seven yards per carry the last two seasons) and receiver (280 yards, three touchdowns in 12 games this fall) give New Orleans a dynamic replacement for Kamara and rising tide to the offense, albeit at considerable expense for a running back.\n\nReleasing Jawaan Taylor could save up to $20 million in salary cap space for 2026. Jaylon Moore hasn't been great and is only under contract through 2026. Josh Simmons was uneven and injured as a rookie, though his ceiling is massive. After Patrick Mahomes faced pressure on at least 42 percent of his dropbacks in his final two games of his 2025 (two games that washed Kansas City out of the postseason race), the Chiefs reload to keep their star QB comfortable.\n\nMauigoa is a rampart in pass protection, but he's truly devastating in space where his 315-pound frame flies upfield to demolish poor, poor linebackers. He's in the running with Fano to be the first tackle off the board in 2026.\n\nTrey Hendrickson won't be coming back, leaving the league's 25th-ranked pass rush in dire need. Maybe 2025 first round pick Shemar Stewart will get there, but he was always a project whose growth was further stunted by a truly pointless contract standoff last season.\n\nBailey brings proven production that Stewart did not, racking up a Big 12-leading 19.5 tackles for loss and an FBS-leading 14.5 sacks after departing Stanford for a hefty payday at Texas Tech. His explosive get-off and devastating closing speed means he can man the second level, but at 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds he's not so small he can't handle edge duties in Ohio (Joseph Ossai, for example, only has an inch and about 15 pounds on him). He's not a perfect fit, but Cincinnati gets a chance to course correct by taking an NFL-ready pass rusher in the first round.\n\nIn theory, Miami's next coach could use this pick to pump up his offense with another athletic marvel and make tight end Kenyon Sadiq a Dolphin. But whomever succeeds Mike McDaniel badly needs to address the league's 25th-ranked defense. And, lo and behold, Miami has a need at safety and Downs has slid out of the top 10.\n\nDowns can play deep or near the line of scrimmage and line up tracking slot receivers with ease. His NFL ceiling is \"Brian Branch, but better.\" He's a fixer, plain and simple, in a Miami defense in need of playmakers.\n\nDoes Jerry Jones truly want to shore up his run defense? If so, Clemson's Peter Woods could be the call here. Is he in the market for a Trevon Diggs replacement? There's Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy, among others. But the combination of need and cost savings at a high cost position instead shift the focus to Faulk, a high potential pass rusher who could lift a team that went from a top-four pressure rate with Micah Parsons in the lineup to the middle of the NFL pack without him.\n\nFaulk brings proven production (seven sacks in 2024 before this fall's down year) and the size Cincinnati covets up front (6-foot-6, 285 pounds). He's not a one-dimensional edge rusher, either; he has legitimate chops on the ground for a defense that ranked 29th in rushing EPA allowed in 2025.\n\nThe Rams only have three pending free agents who played more than 50 percent of the teams snaps on offense or defense. All three are defensive backs, including Cobie Durant. Darious Williams is 32 years old. 2026 presents a wonderful opportunity for LA to take the draft's first cornerback.\n\nEnter Delane, who led the SEC with 11 pass breakups and hauled in a pair of interceptions in 11 games. He can be trusted in single coverage on the sideline, with fluid hips and turn-and-go speed to keep up with NFL deep threats. His trustworthiness on an island could mean more blitzes for the Rams -- and an even scarier defense.\n\nThis is a pick that may hinge on Baltimore's next head coach. But this is a franchise with a definite identity. Landing a hoss like Woods who can set a bruising tone up front would help the Ravens get back to it.\n\nWoods, a 315-pound fairy tale monster with absurd quickness and athleticism, is set to jump up draft boards at the 2026 Scouting Combine. He lands in the top half of the draft here, pairing with Justin Madubuike to give Baltimore some world-class BEEF in the middle of its line and make life easier for the defenders behind them.\n\nLavonte David cannot possibly keep doing this forever. Please welcome his replacement, a taller, faster version of Lavonte David.\n\nStyles is a former safety who plays like it (complimentary), using elite athleticism to create problems at every level. He has the speed to turn and run with slot receivers and the physicality to meet a running back at the line of scrimmage and leave him with nothing but regret.\n\nWith Moore on board, several options to punch up his receiving corps persist. But while solid wideouts will last into Day 2, there may only be one chance to draft 2026's top tight end. With apologies to Denzel Boston and Makai Lemon, Sadiq is the pick.\n\nThe Oregon tight end is an athletic marvel and solid blocker who can seal off running lanes or get out in space to deflect defensive backs. More importantly, he's got excellent speed up the seam and quick change-of-direction skills to snap off linebackers and slot corners. Pair that with solid hands and, baby, you've got a stew going.\n\nDetroit needs a pass rusher big enough to hold down the edge and the intelligence to react and adjust as plays unfold. The 6-foot-3, 265 pound Parker qualifies as a valuable counterweight to Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nThough his numbers tailed off after last year's absurd 19.5-TFL, 11-sack campaign, he remains a versatile piece with a high ceiling and useful floor. He's violent at the point of attack, using a quick punch and active hands to shed blockers, though he's fast enough to win with speed on the edge as well.\n\nByron Murphy and Isaiah Rodgers played well in 2025, but there's no such thing as too many talented quarterbacks in a defense as aggressive as Brian Flores'. Adding McCoy would create space to shift Rodgers to the slot, adding strength over the middle alongside a young player who can be trusted on the boundary.\n\nMcCoy's torn ACL kept him from shining in 2025, but his four-interception 2024 proved he's a shadow in coverage, rarely allowing space thanks to fluid hips, elite quickness and vital recognition skills. He's an asset in man coverage from the line of scrimmage, and erasing quick-outs is a specialty -- something that would be a boon for the Vikings' pressure in the pocket.\n\nThe Panthers are running out of time to decide whether Bryce Young can be their franchise quarterback. After Tetairoa McMillan and Jalen Coker made up 81 percent of their receiving output in a Wild Card loss to the Rams, it's clear Carolina could use help to maximize its young passer.\n\nLemon's size at 5-foot-10 is a concern, but putting him in a lineup across from 6-foot-4 McMillan and 6-foot-3 Coker alleviates that. More importantly, he gives the team another man coverage beater with elite acceleration and quickness who can thrive in the short/intermediate zone in the space McMillan creates.\n\nOhio State's Kayden McDonald could be an answer up front with Kenny Clark on the wrong side of 30. But cornerback is a more pressing need and a top-three prospect has slid into Dallas' range.\n\nNot a single defensive back in the Cowboys locker room finished 2025 with a passer rating under 99 when targeted. Terrell, with 22 breakups the last two seasons (and eight! forced! fumbles!) would be rain to that desert. With elite acceleration and lateral movement, he's difficult to shake -- even if he's a bit smaller than Jerry Jones might prefer at under six feet tall.\n\nSure, a quarterback would be nice here -- but Ty Simpson here feels destined to end up like Kenny Pickett before him. It could be a wideout, but with Lemon off the board Pittsburgh may opt to play into tradition and coach up a receiver selected on Day 2 instead. Thus, we get Banks, a massive lineman who can play multiple roles but, most importantly, can succeed Cameron Heyward and pair with Derrick Harmon and Keeanu Benton to give the Steelers' a terrifying young defensive front.\n\nBanks has to refine his game, but his raw talent would make him a tantalizing lump of clay for a franchise that's expertly molded defensive talent. He's explosive at the snap and elusive laterally, allowing him to shed blocks and contribute all three downs. While injury limited him to three games this season and dented his draft stock, he may be due for a pre-draft rise this spring.\n\nZion Johnson has been frustrating in his time as a Charger and headed to free agency. Jim Harbaugh can pluck a Big Ten star to replace him months after the Patriots ended his season by brutalizing poor Justin Herbert.\n\nIoane, Iowa's Gennings Dunker or Oregon's Emmanuel Pregnon could be the call here, but let's start with the Nittany Lion. He's a brick wall at 330 pounds and has the quickness and aggression to create space at the second level -- something Jim Harbaugh will absolutely love as he establishes the run.\n\nThe Eagles haven't been shy about taking a legendary offensive lineman's replacement early in the draft while he's still on the roster. Cam Jurgens was drafted in 2022 to take over for Jason Kelce. Now comes Lomu ahead of whatever Lane Johnson decides comes next.\n\nPhiladelphia's pressure rate allowed actually decreased between 2024 and 2025, but all was not well across an offensive front whose struggles tied into an overall regression this fall. Lomu is a high level athlete who adjusted to Big 12 play with aplomb, showcasing All-Pro upside for the right head coach. Given the Eagles' success with homegrown and retread blockers in the past, his upside is too much to pass up.\n\nWith a blocking upgrade secured in the top 10, the Browns take the next step to elevate whichever poor, unfortunate soul has to play quarterback next season. It's too early to write off Jerry Jeudy even after his disastrous 2025. Instead, he gets a little help -- and another big body alongside Harold Fannin Jr. to serve as a playmaking threat.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Boston is a bail out machine on jump balls, but his biggest strength comes breaking off defenders in the mid-range. That would make him kind of a super-sized Kayshon Boutte. We've seen how nicely Drake Maye has leaned on Boutte en route to an All-Pro second season, correct?\n\nThe draft board has been kind to the Bears -- even at No. 25 they have a wide array of top-level prospects to choose from at positions of need. Secondary and offensive line help is waiting, but Howell's value for the league's 27th-ranked pass rush is massive.\n\nHowell led the SEC with 11 sacks. While he doesn't have an enormous frame at 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, his versatile pass rushing attack makes him an asset even in Chicago's 4-3 alignment. His ability to use his speed to create leverage and then toss off blockers suggests he could help fix what ails the Bears.\n\nBuffalo could fall in love with a wideout here, but there will be time to address the position on Day 2. Finding a young stud who can keep the middle of the line chugging forward with both Connor McGovern and David Edwards headed to free agency, however, is a tougher call. Dunker could step in immediately to pair with O'Cyrus Torrence as a road-grading young duo at guard.\n\nThe Iowa tackle will likely kick inside due to his arm length but can hold his own on the edge if needed. More importantly, he's mean as hell, quick at the point of attack and difficult to move backward. So, pretty standard Hawkeye stuff.\n\nTrent Williams has to retire someday. We saw how lost the Niners looked without him in stretches in 2025. The Niners' postseason success has prevented them from at least a couple potential saviors earlier in round one, but they still get a good one here. Proctor is enormous; 6-foot-7 and more than 360 pounds.\n\nHe's got the strength to match that frame, but his athleticism belongs to a much smaller man -- including a 32-inch vertical leap despite being the same weight as a Smart car. He's solid as a shadow, and while pad level and lateral quickness will always be a concern with a player his size he should make an immediate impact if Williams doesn't return for 2026.\n\nAh crap, we let the Texans get another elite defensive prospect. McDonald is an anchor up front, damn near impossible to move at 326 pounds. But he's also blessed with an explosive opening salvo that fires him into gaps and shrinks pocket space from the inside-out. Now he gets to pair up with Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter.\n\nCould this be a spot for Alabama's Ty Simpson to serve as Matthew Stafford's apprentice? It's possible, but Allen's availability and the need to add dynamic, young athletic talent to the middle of the field makes the Georgia linebacker the pick.\n\nAllen can handle pass rushing duties as well as lock down the middle of the field in coverage or against the run. He's not huge at 6-foot-1 and 235 pounds, but he moves quickly and fluidity, rarely crossing himself up and sticking to receivers in coverage. He's also a bonafide thumper who can move Omar Speights into pending free agent Troy Reeder's role as a rotational presence.\n\nNew England's pass rush was a strength in its Wild Card win over the Chargers, but K'Lavon Chaisson is a free agent and Harold Landry turns 30 this summer. Reloading here would help create positional savings that will be vital once Drake Maye signs a record-setting contract extension.\n\nUiagalelei can break into the lineup as a pass rushing specialist while fleshing out his game. He's an athletic marvel who looks the part of an NFL star but still needs to refine his game. But with power and speed in droves, he'd bring a stable floor to a position of need for Mike Vrabel.\n\nCisse's turn-and-run ability and elite acceleration suggest he's going to be an absolute darling at the combine. That raw athletic ability is backed by an inconsistent approach -- his 78.9 passer rating in Columbia last season was solid but his 20-plus yards allowed per reception were not. Fortunately, he lands here with a head coach capable of extracting the very best from him.\n\nCisse occasionally plays over-excited, biting on double-moves and adding some boom-bust to his game. Mike Macdonald can fix that. If he can, there's a player with All-Pro potential waiting underneath.\n\nAlex Singleton is a pending free agent on the wrong side of 30. Denver needs a running mate next to Dre Greenlaw in the middle of the field. Hill can do that.\n\nThe Texas star is a smart linebacker who identifies plays and gets where he needs to be to stop them. His coverage continues to develop, but that's a weakness that the rest of the Broncos' defense can help cover as he develops it into a strength.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL mock draft: Can Jets, Browns double-dips save their franchises?",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A guess is that Brian Rolapp, the newish PGA Tour CEO, will be at the SoFi Center up the road from here Tuesday night, when Tiger Woods's TGL team takes on Steve Cohen's other New York team in the second week of the second season of the made-for-TV golf league. He was on hand last week, for the season opener. Does it matter that this is indoor, nighttime golf, a game that has been played outdoors by day for centuries? It does not. Rolapp has his eye on the real prize: In the first week, about 700,000 live viewers watched on ESPN and its broadcast cousins. Decent. Maybe the second week will be better.\n\nCome Wednesday night, Rolapp will likely be at The Breakers, the gilded five-star hotel across the intracoastal waterway from here, for a Tiger Woods birthday bash for 300. If he knows anything about Woods, he knows this kind of event is torture for him, but Woods will be there, a smile on his face, raising money for his philanthropy, the TGR Foundation. If it's important to Woods, it's important to Rolapp. Woods is a member of the PGA Tour policy board, the Tour's Enterprise Board (the for-profit arm) and the chairman of the Tour's Future Competition Committee. In addressing these matters and more - the Genesis Invitational, the Hero World Challenge - Rolapp and Woods will be the greatest Zoom buddies. Does it matter if he could not tell Chris Como from Matt Killen, to cite two of Woods's instructors from recent years? It does not.\n\nA longish preamble to a tea-leaf read of what's going on here, in this whole path-back-to-the-Tour thing, with Brian Rolapp's name and likeness all over it. When Rolapp was named the PGA Tour's new CEO, shortly after last year's U.S. Open, the refrain among people who knew him from the NFL was this: Smart, good business sense, not a golf guy. Turns out that last part, originally meant as a dis, is actually an asset (depending on your view of Monday's news). Brian Rolapp's most significant task is to get people to watch PGA Tour events, in person and, much more significantly, on any screen of their choosing. If getting Brooks Koepka back in the fold is going to help Rolapp in this cause, then he's going to do anything he can to get him back in the fold. There's no reason for him to worry about how Koepka took the LIV Golf money when he could, how he hurt the PGA Tour by leaving, how annoyed rank-and-file players will be by this easy path back. He wants the eyeballs that Koepka will bring. Full stop.\n\nIn his effort to bring back Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm (both U.S. Open winners) and Cameron Smith (winner of both the '22 Players Championship and Open Championship), the same logic will apply.\n\nWhatever happened, happened. We want 'em back.\n\nMonday's news is the opening salvo. Rolapp said in August that his goal is not \"incremental change. It's significant change.\" This is, really, the antithesis of how Augusta National and the Masters works, where the leaders there despise the word change and take all their direction from the word improvement. Golf doesn't have a tradition of \"significant change.\" Rolapp might not know and surely does not care.\n\nWhen the LIV-Tour war first heated up in the summer of ‘22, Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said, \"I am not naive; if this is an arms race and if the only weapons here are dollar bills, the PGA Tour can’t compete.\" That sounded deeply true at the time. Rolapp is here to tell you: Dollar bills are not the only weapons in the LIV-PGA Tour battle. The PGA Tour offers something LIV Golf does not and that is the freedom to make your own schedule. The door to Koepka's return began with that.\n\nAs Rolapp tries to find a path back to the PGA Tour for Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith, the same logic will apply. DeChambeau has flourished under LIV and has some bad PGA Tour memories. With Smith, it's hard to know what he cares about. Rahm could be open to the play-where-you-want argument. But he'd have to leave a mountain pile of Saudi money to do it.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the Saudis just walking away from LIV Golf. Walking away is not in their cultural business makeup. They're too rich and too smart and too ambitious. But Rolapp is going to do everything he can here to weaken LIV Golf. Working with Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and a few other key figures, he will surely pave some kind of narrow path back to the PGA Tour for Talor Gooch, Tyrrell Hatton and Joaquin Niemann and a very few other LIV players who have won on the PGA Tour.\n\nAs for Sergio Garcia, Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Patrick Reed, all winners of major events, I'm guessing Rolapp has less interest in them or he would have expanded the terms in Monday's news. Mickelson is 55 and he has expressed such disdain for the PGA Tour it's hard to imagine him coming back. Woods has never been fond of Sergio Garcia so it's not likely he pushed Rolapp to make it easy for him to return. Patrick Reed's rules debacles made him a PGA Tour outsider. As for Dustin Johnson, whoever knows with him? He can play in the Masters forever. His father-in-law is Wayne Gretzky. He has all the jet skis he needs.\n\nRolapp cannot kill LIV Golf, as the NFL helped kill off the USFL in 1986. But he can weaken it. He can diminish its star power and the appeal of the international series for emerging golf talent. If he can weaken it enough, then LIV Golf and the PGA Tour might be able to some kind of meeting of the minds, where the two leagues co-exist.\n\nIn the meantime, the CEO of the PGA Tour is screaming his unspoken message: I don't care about what happened. I want to fix what's broken now.\n\nMichael Bamberger welcomes your comments at Michael.Bamberger@Golf.com\n\nThe post What Brooks Koepka coup reveals about PGA Tour’s new leader appeared first on Golf.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKevin Durant said it best a decade ago — moms are the real MVPs.\n\nFor C.J. Stroud, that sentiment remains the foundation of a career that continues to defy the odds. After an historic rookie campaign, Stroud has solidified himself as the face of the Houston Texans, orchestrating a stunning late-season surge in 2025. Despite a 3-5 start to the year, Stroud led the Texans to nine straight wins to close the regular season, finishing 12-5 and securing a third consecutive trip to the postseason.\n\nStroud already knows what it takes to succeed on the big stage. In 2023, he became the youngest quarterback in NFL history to win a playoff game when the Texans routed the Browns in the Wild Card round. Now a seasoned veteran of the January spotlight, Stroud has won two playoff games in his first two seasons.\n\nThrough every record-breaking touchdown and every high-pressure drive, Stroud continues to credit his mother, Kimberly, for the resilience that has come to define his game.\n\nFamily ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/K6qwCA6E5q\n\nStroud's close relationship with his mom has been well documented since the Ohio State product entered the league in the fall.

Stroud.\n\nThe two have a very tight relationship. Both have been open about the hardships they faced during Stroud's childhood due to the decisions of his father, Coleridge Bernard Stroud III. The quarterback's dad has been arrested twice and is currently incarcerated on a 38-year sentence.\n\nThe arrest of the patriarch put the family \"into financial ruin.\" The four children and Stroud's mother were close to being homeless as a result.\n\n“My mom, she had to play both roles for me for a while — mother and father,\" Stroud said during the NFL Draft. \"I’m super blessed to have a mother like I do.”\n\nWith Stroud's father mostly absent during the quarterback's adolescence, it caused Stroud to mature at a young age — something that helped mold Stroud into the man he is today.\n\n\"He had a choice when his father went away,\" Stroud's mother said. \"He was going to let that motivate him and be the best or he was going to succumb to it and become a statistic of a kid whose parent did something they shouldn’t.\n\n\"I sit and I’m amazed at how resilient he is. C.J. is the most amazing human I have ever met.\"\n\nMORE: Why is C.J. Stroud's dad in prison?\n\nIn November 2023, Kimberly and C.J. launched the C.J. Stroud Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps single mothers, children of incarcerated parents, and criminal justice reform.\n\n\"There’s a lot of different passions that [C.J.] has ... [helping] single moms [is one of them] since I was a single mom,\" Stroud's mother said. \"We all started crying [during the event] because a mom, her husband’s in prison ... same situation.\n\n\"I’m really grateful that C.J. has taken the step … for a young voice in our generation to shed light on some of the issues that go on in this world.\"",

Each defeat has added another layer of pressure to an already heavy burden.\n\nWhile Herbert’s individual numbers continue to impress, the team’s inability to translate that into meaningful playoff success has become a defining frustration.\n\nHerbert’s arm strength, accuracy, and poise are undeniable, but fans are beginning to question how long his potential can outweigh results.\n\nAs Kim’s comments showed, faith in the Chargers’ process is starting to wear thin – and until Herbert delivers in January, the criticism isn’t going anywhere.",

That represents roughly 12.5% of the average yearly total across the league ($4 million).\n\nBut it all goes to a good cause:\n\nThe fines collected are donated to the Professional Athletes Foundation to support Legends in need and the NFL Foundation to further support the health, safety and wellness of athletes across all levels, including youth football and the communities that support the game.\n\nThe following data was accumulated through the NFL's operations department, compiled as part of their gameday accountability tracker. It does not include or account for any private appeals and their subsequent results.\n\nHere's a look at all fines levied against the Giants in 2025:\n\nOL James Hudson, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/kneeing): $12,172\n\nLB Brian Burns, unsportsmanlike conduct (taunting): $11,593\n\nGiants organization, violating concussion protocol: $200,000\n\nHC Brian Daboll, conduct detrimental to the league: $100,000\n\nRB Cam Skattebo, conduct detrimental to the league: $15,000\n\nS Tyler Nubin, unnecessary roughness (hip-drop tackle): $10,324\n\nRB Cam Skattebo, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $6,157\n\nRB Tyrone Tracy Jr., unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $5,731\n\nDT Rakeem Nunez-Roches, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $23,186\n\nS Dane Belton, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $7,201\n\nLB Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $7,292\n\nTE Theo Johnson, unnecessary rough (late hit): $6,488\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (hit on defenseless player): $7,292\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (pulling player off a pile): $7,293\n\nDB Raheem Layne, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $5,722\n\nS Tyler Nubin, unsportsmanlike conduct (illegal celebration and vulgar acts): $10,324\n\nCB Rico Payton, unnecessary roughness (late hit): $5,333\n\nCB Rico Payton, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $5,333\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (late hit): $7,293\n\nIndividual franchise/coach/player fines: 14\n\nPlayer fined most times: S Dane Belton (3)\n\nLargest fine: Giants organization ($200,000)\n\nPlayer with highest fine total: DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches ($23,186)\n\nPlayer with largest fine: DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches ($23,186)\n\nCumulative fine total: $453,734\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants racked up nearly $500,000 in fines from NFL in 2025",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Chargers are the perpetual disappointments of the NFL",
    "fullText": "When someone tells you who they are, believe them.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have tried telling us they shouldn't be taken seriously for half of a decade, and yet every year before the season begins, multiple folks in the NFL media world will get on their respective platforms and proclaim, \"Woah now, watch out for the Chargers - this is the year they stop being complete crap.\"\n\nThat year has yet to come. The Chargers were defeated handedly by the New England Patriots by the score of 16-3 in the wild card round on Sunday night. While the Chargers have made the postseason in each of the first two years of the Jim Harbaugh era, they have been blown out in both of their wild card playoff games by a combined score of 48-15 and have scored just one touchdown across those two games. That brings us to their polarizing quarterback, who turned in yet another playoff stinker.\n\nHerbert continued building his poor playoff portfolio on Sunday, going 19-of-31 for 159 yards and getting sacked six times. Dating back to the second half of the Chargers' playoff collapse to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2021 postseason, Herbert has played outright awful in the playoffs. In his last 10 quarters of postseason play, he has completed just 50.6 percent of his passes with one touchdown, four interceptions, and has been sacked 12 times. And while the Chargers' offensive line has been largely bad in 2025, Herbert did himself no favors against the Patriots, running into several sacks and shooting himself in the foot a fair amount of times.\n\nConsidering the flip that seems to switch in the biggest games for Herbert, he should be nowhere near conversations regarding the top five quarterbacks in the NFL. He is now 0-3 in the playoffs, and has yet to put together a quality postseason performance in six seasons. Now, he's been surpassed by the quarterback on the other sideline on Sunday. Drake Maye has been in the NFL for 20 months and just played in his first playoff game, and yet he is already more accomplished than Herbert. When you throw in what Trevor Lawrence did this season and the fact that he has more playoff success than Herbert, as well, the former No. 6 overall pick quickly starts sliding down the list of top quarterbacks in the league.\n\nUntil the Chargers, and their quarterback, find a way to play a complete playoff game and actually win in the postseason, they will not be taken seriously as a team who can make a real run - nor should they. They have become the Lob City Los Angeles Clippers of the NFL. Flashy in the regular season with many a tweet showing highlights with an eyeball emoji, but paper tigers that crumble when the games really count.\n\nEagle star defender reveals loss to 49ers may have been his last game with Philadelphia\n\nTimeline of drama between Philadelphia Eagles, A.J.

    "fullText": "SPRINGFIELD–For the first time since 2014, the Kansas City Chiefs are not in the NFL playoffs, and it’s a weird feeling down here, in Arrowhead South.\n\nSince the fall of 2015, the Chiefs had won 10 consecutive AFC West Division titles, and competed in the postseason each year. The height of KC’s playoff prowess came between 2019-2024, when the team reached the Super Bowl five times and won three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nHowever, the annual magic Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid are known for cooking up never materialized in 2025. Mahomes suffered a season-ending injury, a torn ACL, with three games left in the season, and watched as KC finished a disappointing 6-11, which was good enough to be second-to-last in the AFC West Division.\n\nSo, without their beloved team in the postseason for the first time, in more than a decade, how did Chiefs fans feel? Were they relieved? Upset? Indifferent? To find out the answers, I went to the Chiefs Mecca of the Ozarks, Coyotes Adobe Cafe. A.K.A. Arrowhead South.\n\nSure enough, I quickly ran into two fans — Deante Johnson and Jack Murphy. Both guys were about college age and shared their thoughts on having no dog in the fight in the playoffs.\n\n“Every year can’t be a winning year, so, we just gotta sit this one out and hope next year’s better,” said Deante Johnson. “Definitely a speed bump, it’s definitely not over. I mean, if we still have Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid, we’ll be fine.”\n\nMurphy echoed Johnson’s comments.\n\n“Last year was definitely heartbreaking,” said Jack Murphy. “Especially kinda getting pretty ran over in that super bowl, wasn’t fun, but as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid I mean, we can get right back there.”\n\nGlass-half-full kinda guys. The kind of fans you want to hear from. However, did they even care about the playoffs if the Chiefs weren’t in it? Or were they rooting for another team?\n\n“It’s been interesting,” Johnson said. “The NFL has definitely had a lot of unexpected teams come out, like Chicago…so it’s been fun to watch.”\n\nMurphy concurred and even admitted he’d like to see a team from the NFC take home the Super Bowl crown.\n\n“The Seahawks, for sure,” Murphy said. “I think it’s a really great story. I really like their head coach, and JSN (Jaxon Smith-Njigba) is a monster.”\n\nAs for Coyotes management, they too were disappointed Kansas City’s streak came to an unexpected end, but they still drew a good crowd for Sunday’s AFC wildcard game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n“For a decade that’s all we knew, but this year is a little different,” General Manager Jared Presley said. “We actually have other fans coming in this year and today we actually filled up with a bunch of Bills fans and a bunch of Jaguars, so it’s kind of a change, it’s good to see, but at the same time we’re kinda heart broken the Chiefs aren’t here.”\n\nOverall, the fanbase is still a little sore they don’t get to see if their favorite team vie for a chance to claim its fifth Super Bowl title, but, as Deante & Jack stated, “as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid, I mean, we can get right back there.”",

Not only did it end their season, but it may have also marked the end of Moore's Ducks career, despite only being just 20 years old.\n\nSome experts suggest Moore would be right to return to Eugene, such as ESPN's Todd McShay. But Moore himself, however, is unsure.\n\n“I’m going to soak this moment up,” Moore told reporters. \"That’s most important. Just giving hugs and thank-yous to my teammates.

This is going to be a life lesson that a lot of people never get. We just got our butt kicked. Right? That's going to happen in life, right, and not just Dante. Every single person in the locker room, every coach, every person can learn, 'Hey, how do you respond to that?' Some people crawl into a hole, right, don't face the music.”\n\nIt's unclear when Moore will definitively decide his future.

    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has begun, including for some of the league's most high-profile franchises.\n\nHere is an in-depth look at each team, from how their 2025 season went and what their salary cap and free agent situations look like to their draft capital and glaring needs.\n\nAFC East: Bills | Dolphins | Patriots | Jets \nAFC North: Ravens | Bengals | Browns | Steelers \nAFC South: Texans | Colts | Jaguars | Titans \nAFC West: Broncos | Chiefs | Raiders | Chargers \nNFC East: Cowboys | Giants | Eagles | Commanders \nNFC North: Bears | Lions | Packers | Vikings \nNFC South: Falcons | Panthers | Saints | Buccaneers \nNFC West: Cardinals | Rams | 49ers | Seahawks\n\n(Click the team name for the full preview.)\n\nThe Dolphins will start completely fresh with a new regime as the team fired head coach Mike McDaniel. At first, it seemed as if McDaniel might have done enough over the second half of the season to keep his job, thanks to an improved run game and the team never appearing to quit despite the rough start. Miami now has a chance to pivot from McDaniel’s Tua-centric style of offense, but due to the significant investment in that approach, it might not be a quick or easy path out.\n\nThe Jets are hoping that this timeline will mirror the Detroit Lions, where Aaron Glenn came from as defensive coordinator. Detroit went 3-13-1 in Dan Campbell’s first season before a 9-8 record in Year 2. Though unlike the Lions, the Jets will need to find a quarterback. Justin Fields was signed to potentially be that player, but he lasted until only Week 11 before he was replaced. With a ton of draft capital and salary cap space, 2025 could be seen as more of a Year 0 for the Jets and this regime.\n\nMany of the bones that made the Ravens a Super Bowl contender are still in place, headlined by quarterback Lamar Jackson. But Baltimore now has another offseason of figuring out what went wrong. Only this time, it comes much earlier than anticipated with a few more questions that need to be answered — including, for the first time in 18 years, what comes next at head coach after the Ravens fired John Harbaugh.\n\nAfter another disappointing, injury-ridden year, the Bengals will keep Zac Taylor as head coach and Duke Tobin as de facto general manager and try to figure out how to build out a defense and more offensive structure around their three best players, Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.\n\nThis Browns’ season was never going to be about success in 2025. Cleveland seemingly hit on many of the non-quarterback 2025 draft picks — tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger will be top contenders for Rookie of the Year on each side of the ball, if not outright winners — while the Browns picked up a ton of future draft capital, entering the 2026 draft with two first-round picks. Kevin Stefanski is out as head coach, but general manager Andrew Berry will stay on to oversee what the next era of the Browns might be.\n\nIt would have been nearly impossible to think the Colts’ 2025 season would end up here after how it started. The Colts were first in point differential through the first 10 weeks of the season, and 28th from Week 12 on. With Daniel Jones injured and signed to only a one-year deal, plus having no first-round pick, the Colts find themselves in a much tougher offseason situation than anyone could have imagined midway through November.\n\nIt’s impossible to overstate the success of the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first year of head coach Liam Coen. Thirteen wins and an AFC South title are more than most Jacksonville fans could have imagined, even at some points during this regular season. The Jakobi Meyers trade allowed all the offensive pieces to fall into place while Trevor Lawrence ranked fourth in EPA per play and third in success rate from Week 11 until the end of the regular season. The Jaguars were third in weighted DVOA by the time the season ended. Jacksonville got the most out of its talent and it still feels like there’s more to come. A Year 1 couldn’t be much better and expectations are sky-high for Year 2.\n\nThe Titans had hope after drafting QB Cam Ward with the first overall draft pick in 2025, but things never completely came together. Ward flashed, but a lack of talent, especially at receiver, kept Tennessee’s offense from finding its stride. Head coach Brian Callahan was fired after Week 6 with a 1-5 record, 3-14 overall in two seasons with the Titans. Now, Tennessee will search for the next head coach in an attempt to get the most out of Ward and build up a roster that has a young offense while featuring one of the oldest defenses in the league by snap-weighted age.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this season might have been just a small step back for a perennial Super Bowl contender — a chance to regroup and go again. But given Travis Kelce’s age and the late-season ACL tear for Patrick Mahomes, and now grave domestic violence allegations against Rashee Rice, this feels like a bigger moment — the end of an era of this version of the Chiefs. It might not be, but for the first time in the Mahomes era, the Chiefs don’t feel inevitable. This offseason will be the first and an important step in trying to get that feeling back.\n\nThe 2025 Chargers’ season was an objective success. But it feels like they left so much on the table.Justin Herbert was incredible throughout the season, but couldn’t get the production to match. The Chargers lost both starting tackles in Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater, while the team had nine offensive line combinations that played at least 50 snaps together. This also felt like a missed opportunity for a defense that was seventh in weighted DVOA by the end of the season. Coordinator Jesse Minter could become a head coach elsewhere, which would force the Chargers into a defensive reset.\n\nAs good as Dak Prescott and the offense were, the Cowboys were one of the league’s worst defenses the entire season and ultimately fired coordinator Matt Eberflus. Due to the struggles, Dallas traded for Quinnen Williams at the deadline. Williams is a fantastic player and immediately made an impact for the Cowboys, but it cost a 2026 second-round draft pick, leaving Dallas with no Day 2 picks this year, and a single 2027 first-round pick. The offense wasn’t enough to make up for the defensive deficiencies and the Cowboys missed the playoffs in a season when playoff spots felt more wide open than ever.\n\nFor the third straight season, the Giants are looking at a top-six pick in the draft. While some of the young talent was tantalizing, the Giants didn’t have close to a full competitive roster. After going 2-8 this past season, Brian Daboll was fired as head coach. The Giants now need a new head coach, and have decided general manager Joe Schoen will stick around.\n\nThis was not the world-beating team so many expected to see after last year’s Super Bowl title. How the Eagles played in games was telling. In 2024, they were 24th in points per drive on their opening possession, but improved to fifth over the rest of the game. The 2025 Eagles were sixth in points per drive on their opening possession, but dropped to 25th on all following drives. The talent is still overwhelming. That was the case with a defense that was still second in EPA per play while developing multiple All-Pro-caliber players. But, also as the defense proved, this team needs to figure out how to make that talent work together instead of just relying on the talent to carry itself.\n\nAfter a season when everything broke right for the Commanders, just about everything went wrong in 2025. Last season, Washington went 7-2 in games decided by seven points or fewer. The Commanders were 0-5 in those games this past season. Washington finished the season in the bottom five of defensive DVOA. Now defensive coordinator Joe Whitt and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury are not coming back next season. While the Commanders still have the bones of the impressive 2024 team — and a likely healthy Jayden Daniels set to return — this is a franchise that will have to step back and retool a bit earlier than expected.\n\nA 9-8 record is disappointing given where the Lions had been, but this is still a team that finished third in DVOA — it was not a total disaster. Detroit finished third in yards per play on offense, though there were times when the limits of Jared Goff as a quarterback were more exposed than in years past. A shaky offense forced Campbell to take over play-calling in the middle of the season and the Lions will look for a new offensive coordinator in the offseason. The Lions still had the eighth-best point differential in the league, better than NFC playoff teams such as the 49ers, Eagles, Packers, Bears and Panthers. It’s hardly a consolation prize, but this team is still on the right track.\n\nSlowly and surely, injuries chipped away at what made the 2025 Packers special. Tucker Kraft’s torn ACL in Week 8 eliminated the offense’s biggest weapon, a man-beater and yards-after-the-catch monster. Then, a torn ACL for Micah Parsons in Week 15 sapped the hope that Green Bay’s defense could cause enough chaos to lead the way. Those pillar pieces will return in 2026, which should again make the Packers one of the top contenders in the NFL. But after another disappointing early playoff exit, 2026 might need to be the season when the results actually follow. With a potential salary cap crunch and no first-round draft pick, the Packers are going to have to hope the players already put in place can be as good as they need to be in the long term.\n\nExpectations were high for the Vikings coming off a 14-win season in 2024. However, the main goal of 2025 was to get as much information as possible on quarterback J.J. McCarthy. Minnesota disappointed and also did not get a clear evaluation of McCarthy as a quarterback. Despite that, the Vikings still finished above their win total and over .500. That was mostly thanks to a Brian Flores defense that ranked third in DVOA. Flores is a free agent, who could be hired elsewhere as a head coach or defensive coordinator. If most of the pieces stay in place, the Vikings remain a well-structured team that is just average quarterback play away from contending.\n\nThe Falcons won the final game of the regular season to reach a three-way tie in record at the top of the NFC South. But Atlanta’s win sent Carolina to the playoffs, while the Falcons officially finished third in the division and fired head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot. The issue with Atlanta over the past two seasons was a clear misevaluation of where the team was and how to build the roster around it. A four-game win streak wasn’t enough to salvage the season. Neither were the individual bright spots, like Drake London and Bijan Robinson. Even the defense impressed in stretches, but it was never enough to make the Falcons feel like a franchise with a coherent plan and path forward.\n\nAn 8-9 record might not feel like a win, but some offensive competence and competitive games would have been the goal heading into the season, and that’s what Carolina got. There are more building blocks in place than there were last season, and this is still one of the youngest teams in the league by snap-weighted age. There might not be a clear answer about the long-term potential of Bryce Young, who finished the regular season 28th in EPA per play, but there have been enough high marks that the team could feel comfortable getting one more season to figure it out. The Panthers sit at a much better spot than they did coming off last year’\n\nFraming the 2025 season as a success for the Saints would be a stretch, but there’s a lot more to like than would meet the eye. First-year head coach Kellen Moore laid a solid foundation for his offense, and the Saints’ defense reached the top half of the league in DVOA under coordinator Brandon Staley. Tyler Shough was 22nd among quarterbacks in EPA per play but was in the top 10 over the final five weeks of the regular season, when the Saints went 4-1.\n\nThe Bucs were 6-2 at their Week 9 bye and wound up missing the playoffs. There was a lot of attention given to Baker Mayfield’s dropoff after the bye, but the Bucs went from 13th in EPA per play to only 18th. However, Tampa Bay dropped from sixth in EPA per play on defense before the bye — aided by a strong run defense — to 28th post-bye. The Bucs can hope that better health leads to more success in 2026, but there should be some reflection on what went wrong and what needs to be fixed to keep the franchise moving forward. The Bucs have decided to retain head coach Todd Bowles, though they fired offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard, QB coach Thad Lewis and special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey.\n\nOffensively, things never clicked. Kyler Murray was in and out of the lineup with injuries, which ultimately ended his season early. Now there are big questions about his future with the franchise. There were bright spots on defense, like rookie cornerback Denzel Burke and free-agent signing Josh Sweat, but injuries hamstrung this team all over. Jonathan Gannon was let go as head coach after three seasons, none of them over .500, and a 15-36 record.",

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Ranking the nine teams left in 2026 playoffs, from Seahawks to Steelers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL playoff field started with 14 teams. With five of six wild-card games in the books, it's down to a fine nine ahead of the Steelers hosting the Texans in Pittsburgh for the wild weekend finale on Monday night.\n\nThere were some classic shootouts and games that came down to the wire and three was the unlucky seed number with both the Eagles and Jaguars being upset at home on Sunday.\n\nWith the two top-seeded bye teams prepping for playoff action and the NFC and AFC conference games almost set, here's an updated comparison of the teams still alive to win Super Bowl 60:\n\nThe Seahawks won a tough NFC West from which the Rams and their opponents, the 49ers, also made the divisional round. They have a dominant defense, balanced and explosive offense and are well coached by Mike Macdonald and Klint Kubiak. They should be ready for the rubber match with San Francisco after losing to the 49ers at home in Week 1. The key is Sam Darnold and the entire team avoiding lingering turnover issues.\n\nThe Patriots showed they were a complete and playoff-tough team under Mike Vrabel when their offense was contained by the Chargers. Drake Maye still overcame some tough pressure and made the plays when they counted most. The defense also sent a strong message with a dominant start in the wild-card round. They are looking like the steady playoff winner they used to be with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\n\nMORE: How Drake Maye overcame turnovers to beat Chargers\n\nThe Broncos will get a tough draw against the Bills, but then again Buffalo's offense has hit snags when Josh Allen faces top pressure and coverage defenses on the road. Denver's defense will need to set the tone at home, where Bo Nix tends to lead the offense best. The Broncos will see the Patriots as expected in the AFC championship game as long as they don't get off to too slow of a start and play catchup to the Bills.\n\nThe Rams' defense has a lot of potential with its run stopping, pressure and coverage, but it has its share of holes. The good news, they got a rough game out of their system against the Panthers.\n\nMatthew Stafford and Puka Nacua kept sizzling and trying to pass well enough to outscore them is a real challenge. With L.A. getting over an early scare, it should be refocused to rebound stronger for the divisional round.\n\nMORE: Three problems Sean McVay, Rams must fix after beating Panthers\n\nThe Bills got over a massive playoff obstacle in Josh Allen's first road wild-card game by outlasting the tough Jaguars by making fewer mistakes in the clutch, leading to a 27-24 fourth-quarter escape. In the divisional round, Allen will look up and see no Chiefs, Ravens or Bengals still in the AFC playoff mix.\n\nAllen has proved to be the great postseason equalizer and then some when their running game and defense are off. He should be the most trusted big-play and clutch QB left in the field.\n\nMORE: Three reasons why Bills passed their toughest test vs. Jags\n\nThe Bears seem to keep living dangerously as the worst total defense in the playoffs and have been too dependent on getting key takeaways. It had to feel good that they could win a game when four fumbles by the Packers didn't go their way and had zero interceptions from Jordan Love.\n\nIt would be nice for Ben Johnson  if Caleb Williams and the offense to start faster instead of waiting to explode while exploiting the best passing game matchups in the fourth quarter. Getting the league's No. 3 rushing offense going early would help. They will be ready to be better all-around after getting valuable playoff experience to take down their archrivals at home.\n\nMORE: How Caleb Williams made Bears' history in comeback victory over Packers\n\nThe 49ers took out the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles in Philadelphia with a gritty shorthanded defensive performance for the ages. They also had to adjust to yet another big offensive injury to George Kittle, grinding away with Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey with great playoff scheming by Kyle Shanahan. They might not have enough health in their favor to get to another Super Bowl, but their experience can't be ignored in a still wide-open field.\n\nMORE: Christian Mcaffrey shines with 2 TDs in upset victory over Eagles\n\nThe Texans have won playoff games in each of the previous two trips with C.J. Stroud at quarterback under DeMeco Ryans. They draw a tough even matchup against the low-scoring, defensive-minded Steelers on Monday night. They will need to get hot offensively and score more to advance and have a shot against the Patriots on the road.\n\nThe Steelers are hoping that Aaron Rodgers can have some throwback magic left in him at 41 with DK Metcalf returning to raise the big-play potential for their QB's still strong arm. But equal keys is finding a consistent running game and much improving the defensive communication. It might be asking too much for the Steelers to win ugly more than once.",

Join the discussion in the comments below.\n\nHere is some basic information to help guide you through the game:\n\nHow to watch the game – TV schedule and online streaming information;\n\nFollow along with 49ers fans at Niners Nation;\n\nEagles full regular season schedule;\n\nNote: This is an open thread. Discuss the game and stay tuned for new threads after each quarter.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\n4Q – 2:54 [Eagles 19, Niners 24] — With the help of some penalties. The 49ers were able to take the lead back just before the two-minute warning. They opted to kick an extra point instead of going for two, but they missed and only hold a 4-point buffer.\n\n4Q – 8:00 [Eagles 19, Niners 17] — The Eagles were forced to settle for a field goal, but Jake Elliott was able to connect on a 33 yarder for Philadelphia to retake the lead.\n\n4Q – 14:52 [Eagles 16, Niners 17] — Brock Purdy connected with Christian McCaffrey for a 29-yard touchdown to take the lead for the first time since the first quarter. To make matters worse, Jalen Carter was flagged for roughing the passer which was a penalty imposed on the next play.\n\n3Q – 2:20 [Eagles 16, Niners 10] — After several three-and-outs to start the second half, the Eagles were able to get into field goal range, and Jake Elliott made a 41-yard kick to extend their lead.\n\n2Q – 2:50 [Eagles 13, Niners 10] — The 49ers had to settle for a field goal after Jordan Davis made two clutch stops to force them into fourth down. Eddy Pineiro nailed a 36-yard field goal to inch closer to the Eagles before halftime.\n\nNotable: 49ers TE George Kittle had to be carted off the field during the drive after suffering what appeared to be a torn Achilles.\n\n2Q – 6:08 [Eagles 13, Niners 7] — Dallas Goedert scored his second touchdown of the day on a nine-yard TD pass on 4th-and-2. The 16-play drive had a little bit of everything, including their first tush push of the game, and some Tank Bigsby carries.\n\n1Q – 6:16 [Eagles 6, Niners 7] — The Eagles offense was (surprisingly) quick to respond and scored points off a 10-play drive that was super run-heavy, and ended with a Dallas Goedert TD — his 12th of the season! Unfortunately, Jake Elliott’s issues don’t seem resolved as he missed what could be a very critical point-after attempt.\n\n1Q – 11:51 [Eagles 0, Niners 7] — Well, that wasn’t a great start from the Eagles defense. Vic Fangio’s group gave up a frustrating 61-yard catch and followed that up by allowing several more plays that resulted in the 49ers scoring the first points of the game. Brock Purdy connected with Demarcus Robinson in the back of the endzone for six.\n\nNote: if the tracker isn’t properly loading for you, you can CLICK HERE.\n\nA Twitter List by BleedingGreen",

It wasn’t pretty, but the 49ers are headed to the Divisional Round.

Here's how the draft order looks after the start of the playoffs:\n\n13. Falcons (traded first-round pick to Rams)\n\n16. Colts (traded first-round pick to Jets)\n\n20. Packers (traded first-round pick to Cowboys)\n\n24. Jaguars (traded first-round pick to Browns)\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders earned the first overall pick by having with the easiest schedule of the four teams that finished tied with the worst record in the NFL, 3-14.\n\nDraft picks are awarded in order of lowest winning percentage, and the tiebreaker is opponents’ winning percentage, with the team that played the easiest schedule picking first. If two teams have the same record and same strength of schedule, division or conference tiebreakers are applied. If the divisional or conference tiebreakers are not applicable, or ties still exist between teams of different conferences, ties will be broken the following tie-breaking method:\n\nBest won-lost-tied percentage in common games (minimum of four)\n\nStrength of victory in all games\n\nBest combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed in all games\n\nBest net touchdowns in all games\n\nThe 18 non-playoff teams get the first 18 picks. The six wild card round playoff losers get picks 19-24, the four divisional round losers get picks 25-28, the conference championship game losers get picks 29 and 30, the Super Bowl loser gets pick 31 and the Super Bowl winner gets pick 32.\n\nThe 2026 NFL draft takes place April 23-25 in Pittsburgh. The first round will be on Thursday night, the second and third rounds will be on Friday night, and the fourth through seventh rounds will be on Saturday.\n\nIndiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is the betting favorite to go first overall. Other contenders include Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, Miami defensive end Rueben Bain, Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese, Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and Auburn defensive end Keldric Faulk",

    "description": "Here's a look at the offseason work ahead for the Philadelphia Eagles.",
    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has begun, and Yahoo Sports is previewing the coming months for all 32 teams, from free agency through the draft and more.\n\nAFC East: Bills | Dolphins | Patriots | Jets\nAFC North: Ravens | Bengals | Browns | Steelers \nAFC South: Texans | Colts | Jaguars | Titans \nAFC West: Broncos | Chiefs | Raiders | Chargers \nNFC East: Cowboys | Giants | Eagles | Commanders \nNFC North: Bears | Lions | Packers | Vikings \nNFC South: Falcons | Panthers | Saints | Buccaneers \nNFC West: Cardinals | Rams | 49ers | Seahawks\n\n2025 season record: 11-6 (u 11.5 wins), first in NFC East, lost to 49ers in wild-card round, 13th in DVOA\n\nThis was not the world-beating team so many expected to see after last year’s Super Bowl title. Last season. Philadelphia battled with some inconsistency in the offense but found a groove by the end of the season. The 2025 version never fully got it.\n\nHow the Eagles played in games was telling. In 2024, they were 24th in points per drive on their opening possession, but improved to fifth over the rest of the game. The 2025 Eagles were sixth in points per drive on their opening possession, but dropped to 25th on all following drives. The 2024 Eagles figured it out, while the 2025 version couldn’t adapt. Offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo might take the fall for that, failing to replicate the work Kellen Moore did previously.\n\nThe talent is still overwhelming. That was the case with a defense that was still second in EPA per play while developing multiple All-Pro-caliber players. But, also as the defense proved, this team needs to figure out how to make that talent work together instead of just relying on the talent to carry itself.\n\nThe Eagles have just over $14 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap. That ranks 16th. They’re fairly locked into this roster. Because of how the Eagles have structured their contracts, there’s not a lot of restructure potential — most contracts are pre-restuctured with small base salaries and option bonuses. If the Eagles re-sign Dallas Goedert early, they could create space by shrinking the $20.5 million figure that would hit the cap when his contract voids on Feb. 16.\n\nTE Dallas Goedert \nEdge Jaelan Phillips \nLB Nakobe Dean \nS Reed Blankenship\n\nGoedert led the team and was ninth in the league with a 27.8% target share in the red zone. His 10 red zone touchdowns were second only to Davante Adams. Jaelan Phillips was a defense-changer after the trade that brought him to Philadelphia. From Weeks 1-9, the Eagles were 14th in pressure rate. After Phillips was acquired, they ranked fifth. Dean has been excellent and was immediately put back into the starting lineup when he returned from injury, but the presence of Jihaad Campbell and the high rate of nickel defense will likely make Dean expendable in free agency.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are two of the best players at their positions, but the second outside cornerback spot was a hole all season. Adoree’ Jackson was one of the most targeted cornerbacks on a per-snap basis and the Eagles ranked 24th in DVOA against WR2s.\n\nEven if Goedert is re-signed, the Eagles should add a tight end to the mix. Grant Calcaterra was a negative as a blocker and did not make up for it enough as a receiver — though the Eagles were fifth in EPA per play from 12 personnel, which they ran at the 12th-highest rate in the league.\n\nDepth on the edge will need to be addressed. That was the reason for the Phillips trade and bringing Brandon Graham out of retirement. Neither of them is under contract for 2026.\n\n1st round \n2nd round \n3rd round \n3rd round (projected compensatory) \n4th round \n4th round (projected compensatory) \n5th round (ATL) \n5th round (projected compensatory)\n6th round\n\nThe Eagles have built their dominance through the trenches, and now they find Lane Johnson’s long-term replacement. Lomu moves well for his size, and has polished technique and can add even more weight and strength. He can learn behind Jeff Stoutland and the All-Pros they have along the line before taking over himself.\n\nThe Eagles went 10-7 against the spread in the 2025-26 regular season, but were only 8-7 ATS as a favorite. They were also a surprisingly poor 4-4 ATS at home. — Ben Fawkes",

If the 49ers upset the Eagles, Seattle would host San Francisco and Chicago would host LA.\n\nSaturday Rams-Panthers update: The Rams won a wild one over the Panthers to open the 2026 NFL Playoffs. It does not tell us much more about the Seahawks Divisional Round opponent other than to eliminate the Panthers from the list.\n\nThe NFL re-seeds its bracket after the Wild Card round. That means the Seahawks will face the worst remaining seed rather than knowing it will be one of two teams. If all the higher seeds win in the Wild Card round, Seattle would play the No. 4 seeded Carolina Panthers. If all the lower seeds create upsets, Seattle would play the No. 7 seeded Green Bay Packers. It could fall anywhere in between depending on how the higher seeds perform, with the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams also in the mix as potential opponents. The Seahawks could know their Divisional Round opponent as soon as Saturday night if the Packers upset the Bears. Otherwise, they’ll find out their opponent by the close of the 49ers-Eagles game on Sunday.\n\nRecord: 31-23 regular season, 1-1 postseason all-time\n\nThe teams split their regular season series, with each team winning the road game. The Seahawks won the Week 18 finale to clinch the NFC West and the No. 1 seed. The last time they faced off in the playoffs was 2023, with the 49ers winning 41-23.\n\n49ers @ Seahawks\nSpread: Seahawks -7\nTotal: 46.5\nMoneyline: Seahawks -330, 49ers +265\n\nThe Seahawks return to the playoffs after a two-season absence. They lost in the Wild Card round in 2022, and lost in the same round two seasons prior. The last time they played in the Divisional Round was 2019, where they won a wild card game and then lost to the Packers.\n\nThis marks the fourth time the Seahawks have earned the No. 1 seed. The previous instances were in 2005, 2013, and 2014. They reached the Super Bowl in all three of those seasons, and won it in 2013.",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns may have only won five games in 2025, but they may not be far off, and their future is bright.\n\nAs the NFL wildcard weekend continues, ESPN showed a graphic on the youngest wide receivers in the NFL, and the Browns led the league in one key statistic. What was that statistic?\n\nThey led the NFL in snaps played by a rookie, and they led it by a landslide. According to ESPN, the Browns had 5,971 snaps played by a rookie in 2025. This was the most by over 600 snaps played. The New York Jets were second on the list with 5,327 snaps played by a rookie this past season.\n\nThis makes sense when considering that rookie quarterbacks started most of the season for the Browns, a rookie led them in rushing and receiving, their starting middle linebacker was a rookie, as was one of their starting defensive tackles. The rookies played well this season, and that bodes well for the future of the franchise.\n\n— Mike Kadlick (@mikekadlick) January 11, 2026\n\nJust look at the Patriots. They are in their second season after landing a quarterback in the 2024 NFL Draft. They did not even start him right away and gave him an on-ramp to the field as a rookie. Now, they are AFC East champs and are in contention for a Super Bowl after winning 14 games.\n\nOf course, the key difference between the Browns and the Patriots right now is that the Browns are still hunting for their quarterback of the future. Well, and a head coach.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns led NFL in one crazy stat that bodes well for their future",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe AFC wild card round delivers one of the most exciting quarterback showdowns of the weekend as Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills (12-5, No. 6 seed) travel south to EverBank Stadium to face Trevor Lawrence and the AFC South Champion Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4, No. 3 seed).\n\nThis game pits two of the league's premier signal-callers against each other for the right to advance. While Allen and the Bills bring years of deep playoff experience, they will have to contend with a red-hot Jaguars team that hasn't lost since early November and enters the postseason carrying an impressive eight-game winning streak.\n\nThe wild card tilt carries a fascinating historical footnote as well: the Jaguars are 2-0 all-time against the Bills in the playoffs, securing wins in the 1996 and 2017 Wild Card rounds. However, this is a completely different era, defined by the dynamic, explosive offenses led by superstar quarterbacks. Lawrence, in particular, has elevated his game down the stretch, leading the AFC's hottest team with an MVP-caliber run through the second half of the season, a stretch that saw the Jaguars averaging 34 points per game.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills, despite being the lower seed and playing on the road for the first time in the wild card round since 2019, are looking to finally reach the Super Bowl; with the reigning MVP Josh Allen at the helm.\n\nHere's how to listen to the matchup.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channels 225 (Bills), 226 (Jaguars)\n\nJaguars radio channel: 1010XL / 92.5 FM\n\nThe Bills and Jaguars can be found on nationally on SiriusXM, where listeners can tune into the game from any location. Along with the national channel 88, channel 225 (Bills) and 226 (Jaguars) will provide team specific broadcasts.\n\nThose in the Buffalo area can listen to WGR 550, which carries all Bills football games through the season.

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos now know what to expect in a playoff atmosphere. This time, they have an edge: home-field advantage and the full force of the Mile High faithful (and thin air!) behind them. And they are ready.\n\nDenver played a lot of close games this season, which could help them come the playoffs, where most of the games come down to just a few plays. Quarterback Bo Nix talked about how this could help them in January.\n\n“I think we’ve been fortunate this year to play in a lot of close games and we’ve won a lot of close games,\" said Nix. \"It hasn’t been the pretty… The ones that you want. The flashy, big-time wins. The ones where you get to go over there and sit, rest a little bit in the fourth [quarter]. It’s part of it. Sometimes you have to go and play the tough ones. It’s better to win some of these tough ones than lose them, obviously, for our position. It has put us in a position to understand what winning football is like. We’ve played a lot of playoff teams in these tough situations.\"\n\nSome of the playoff teams the Broncos have faced this year include the Los Angeles Chargers, Philadelphia Eagles, Houston Texans, Green Bay Packers and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Broncos went 4-2 in those games, with two of those wins and one loss being a one-score game; three games (Denver played two against the Chargers) were more than one score, and the Broncos went 2-1 in those games.\n\n\"A lot of them have felt a little bit what physical, competitive football feels like,\" Nix said. \"A lot of guys fighting for a seed or fighting to get in the tournament in general. I think it’ll help us. It definitely won’t hurt us. It’ll give us the experience and speed up the experience for some of the young guys like myself [to] give us the best chance to hopefully go in here and understand how to win some of these games.”\n\nCornerback Pat Surtain also spoke about the playoff atmospheres Denver has been in this year.\n\n“We had some playoff atmospheres this year where we had some adversity early on in the game and we find a way to bounce back and finish games,\" said Surtain. \"I feel like we are definitely battle-tested in that regard and we always find ways to win. Just in the playoffs, though, we can’t find ourselves shooting ourselves in the foot consistently. We have to find ways to really dominate and find ways to get a faster start. I think that’s what we need to focus on moving forward. As a team, we are battle-tested. We are strong as a unit and it showed over the whole season.”\n\nDenver's battle-readiness will be tested when they face their next opponent at Mile High in the divisional round.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Bo Nix and Broncos are battle-tested going into playoffs",

It was a move that became inevitable when head coach Dan Quinn stripped Whitt of defensive play-calling duties ahead of Week 11.\n\nThe Commanders hired a new offensive coordinator on Friday, promoting assistant quarterbacks coach David Blough. Don't expect Washington to promote an internal candidate for defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Commanders have interviewed three known candidates thus far. One of those candidates drew the attention of one of the NFL's top defensive stars.\n\nOne of the three known interviews is Chiefs' defensive line coach Joe Cullen. Considered one of the league's top defensive line coaches, Cullen has been with the Chiefs since 2022. When ESPN's Adam Schefter revealed that Cullen had interviewed with Washington, star defensive tackle Chris Jones had an interesting reaction on X.\n\nOh sh!+……. https://t.co/8b0bG5pSpR\n\n— Chris Jones (@StoneColdJones) January 9, 2026\n\nThat reaction would seem to indicate that Jones doesn't want to see Cullen leave Kansas City. Of course, who really knows?\n\nCullen, a former college nose guard at UMass, has been a coach since 1990. He's been an NFL assistant since 2006, working with multiple teams as the defensive line coach. He's been an NFL coordinator once before, albeit briefly. During Urban Meyer's forgettable NFL career, Cullen served as his defensive coordinator in 2021.\n\nThe Commanders have the No. 7 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and badly need a pass rusher.

After having six comeback wins in the regular season, they capped off yet another one in their postseason matchup against the Green Bay Packers, winning 31-27 in a stunning comeback victory to advance to the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThings looked bleak early, as the Bears fell behind 21-3 in the first half after Jordan Love threw three touchdown passes. The Bears offense sputtered too many times and failed to convert on multiple fourth downs as faith in the defense was at an all-time low. Things looked bleak, but the team didn't lose hope.\n\nQuarterback Caleb Williams and the defense rallied in the second half to turn the momentum, scoring 28 points to storm back and retake the lead. Key passes to Colston Loveland, DJ Moore, and Rome Odunze kept drives alive as the Bears took control of the game from the Packers. After Williams found Moore for the go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, the Packers were unable to mount one more scoring drive.\n\nIt was the craziest comeback victory in a season full of them, and the NFL world took notice.

Carolina’s draft position is now locked into place at No. 19. The rest of the teams that lose this weekend will fill in slots 20-24.\n\nCarolina ranked near the bottom of the NFL in 2026 in sacks with 30, and edge rusher is absolutely a top need heading into free agency and the draft. Rico Dowdle was the team’s leading rusher, with 1,076 yards and six rushing touchdowns, plus contributed 297 receiving yards and a touchdown through the air, and he’s hitting free agency. Christian Rozeboom, the Panthers’ tackles leader who also had two sacks, three pass break-ups, a pick and a forced fumble, will also become a free agent when the new league year ends. The Panthers are projected to have about $39 million in cap space to work with this offseason based on the 51-man projection, but obviously when they can shore up these key positions through the draft, it makes long-term team building for success easier.\n\nHere’s the updated draft order after the Panthers’ Wild Card exit.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (via Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (via Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (via Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (via Jacksonville Jaguars)",

    "fullText": "The NFL playoffs have arrived, and 12 teams will duke it out in Wild Card games for a shot at the Divisional round. We've gathered everything you need to know about where to watch NFL Wild Card games, including live streaming options.\n\nThe Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks earned first-round byes, but the other 12 teams to make it to the postseason will battle it out in one of six Wild Card games. The NFC will see Los Angeles Rams vs. Carolina Panthers, Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears, and San Francisco 49ers vs. Philadelphia Eagles showdowns. The AFC will feature Buffalo Bills vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Chargers vs. New England Patriots, and Houston Texans vs. Pittsburgh Steelers games.\n\nThe most notable omission in this year's postseason lineup is the Kansas City Chiefs, who haven't missed the playoffs in several years and made it all the way to the Super Bowl for five out of the six past seasons. The Chiefs faced a tricky couple of months and ultimately lost their star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, to a season-ending knee injury in mid-December.\n\nWhether the Eagles, the reigning champions, can go all the way again this year or whether there will be two fresh teams at Super Bowl LX remains to be seen. Keep reading to learn some of the best ways to tune into the Wild Card round, including global streaming options.\n\nThe NFL Wild Card games are spread across several networks and streaming services in the US, including Prime Video, CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN. Each network has its own streaming counterpart, which we'll dig into below, but if you're looking to watch every game (other than the streaming exclusive Prime Video match-up) in one place, then a live TV streaming service will be able to help you out.\n\nThe best live TV streaming service we've tested that carries CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN, in addition to other networks, is DirecTV. These channels are available in any of the streamer's Signature packages, but you can also find them in the DirecTV MySports genre pack. MySports carries around 20 popular sports channels and unlocks access to ESPN Unlimited. Local channels in genre packs sometimes vary by region, so it's a good idea to see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. MySports subscriptions cost $70 a month, while Signature plans start at $90 a month. DirecTV offers a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nDirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network.\n\nAs we mentioned above, the Packers vs. Bears game will be exclusive to Prime Video. Subscriptions start at $9 a month, but you also get Prime Video access with all Amazon Prime subscriptions, which cost $15 a month. New users can get a 30-day free trial.\n\nAmazon Prime Video is a capable, competitive streaming service that's more than just a Prime membership perk. You can also \n\nThe Bills vs. Jaguars game will be broadcast on CBS. Paramount Plus is CBS's streaming counterpart. The Premium tier ($13 a month) is typically needed to unlock CBS live streaming, but NFL games are also available with the Essential plans ($8 a month). New users can get a seven-day free trial.\n\nParamount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime.\n\nThe Chargers vs. Patriots game will air on NBC. Cord-cutters can live stream the game through Peacock. While you typically need Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month) to unlock NBC live streaming, you're able to watch NFL games with the Peacock Premium ($11 a month) tier.\n\nPeacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n\nThe Texans vs. Steelers game will air on both ESPN and ABC. ESPN's direct streaming counterpart is ESPN Unlimited, which costs $30 a month. While the cheaper ESPN Select tier unlocks some action, you'll need to opt for the Unlimited plan to watch this game.\n\nESPN Unlimited has everything from ESPN Plus, in addition to all that the ESPN linear networks have to offer.\n\nThe Rams vs. Panthers and 49ers vs. Eagles games will air on FOX. FOX's direct streaming counterpart is FOX One, which starts at $20 a month and comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nAll games will also be available through NFL Plus, where subscriptions start at $7 a month (or $15 a month for Premium). However, games are only available on mobile devices, like cell phones and tablets, so we recommend one of the above streaming services if you'd like to watch the games on a TV. There's also an opportunity to bundle NFL Plus Premium with ESPN Unlimited for $40 a month, a reduced rate compared to subscribing to each service separately.\n\nNFL fans in the UK and other regions can watch every game through DAZN's NFL Game Pass. Subscriptions prices vary by region and plan, but the streaming service will host the entirety of the NFL postseason, including the Super Bowl.\n\nDAZN is the home of NFL Game Pass International, the only service offering live and on-demand access to all NFL games in supported countries outside the United States and China.\n\nFootball fans don't need to worry about missing out on any of the action just because they're traveling away from home. Viewers can keep up with their usual websites and apps from anywhere with the help of a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs are easy-to-use tech tools that enable people to change their devices' virtual locations. This way, their usual services work from anywhere the same way they would back home. They're also strong ways to improve online security.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start, NordVPN is one of the best apps on the market. It's fast, user-friendly, and offers some solid security features. You can learn \n\nNordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs.\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

On the other side of the ball, Travis Etienne will churn out yards against a Bills run defense that is near the bottom of the league in every metric.\n\nThe Bills are just 31st in the league in defensive rush EPA and DVOA. Etienne finished the regular season with 1107 rushing yards, and the Jags will lean on their ground game to keep Buffalo's explosive offense off the field.\n\nJosh Allen's passing numbers wildly fluctuate due to game script and weather conditions. Since we have the Jags covering, Allen will have a neutral or negative game script, and this is the nicest weather he's played in since Week 12.\n\nTravis Etienne Jr. Over 64.5 rushing yards\n\nJosh Allen Over 225.5 passing yards\n\nJags QB Trevor Lawrence has scored nine touchdowns in his last 13 games and isn't afraid to run in high-leverage situations.\n\nTravis Etienne Jr. Over 64.5 rushing yards\n\nJosh Allen Over 225.5 passing yards\n\nTrevor Lawrence anytime touchdown\n\nSpread: Bills -1.5 (-102) | Jaguars +1.5 (-120)\n\nMoneyline: Bills -110 | Jaguars -106\n\nOver/Under: Over 51.5 | Under 51.5\n\nSince I'm taking the Jags on the small +1.5 spread, I'd also be willing to bet them on the moneyline. After all, they have the better defense and home-field advantage against a Bills squad that can't stop the run.\n\nScore prediction: Jaguars 25, Bills 24\n\nThe Bills have gone 4-9 ATS in their last 13 games as a favorite.

    "fullText": "A thrilling AFC Divisional Round game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills at the end of the 2021-2022 NFL season led the league to change the overtime rules for playoff games, giving both teams a chance to possess the football. Previously, the team that won the coin toss could elect to receive the kick, and would win the game with a touchdown on their first drive.\n\nThe outcry after Josh Allen and the Bills lost that playoff game without getting a chance to touch the football in overtime led to the revised rules.\n\nSo as the 2025-2026 NFL Playoffs get ready to begin, let’s revisit those rules, because you never know when you will need to know them.\n\nAll playoff games that advance to overtime will follow these revised rules:\n\nIf a game is tied at the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nBoth teams will have an opportunity to possess the football. This is the big change. Previously, as we saw in the 2022 AFC Divisional Round game between Kansas City and Buffalo, if the team that started with the football scored a touchdown, the game was over. Under the new rules, in that scenario, Buffalo would get a chance to match with a touchdown of their own, and if they did, the game would continue. Once both teams have had possession, the game then becomes sudden death. In addition, if the team that starts with possession scores and kicks the extra point to take a seven-point lead, the second team can win with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession is still in progress — the teams will play another overtime period. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nIf the game remains tied after two overtime periods, there will be a second half. The captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be a third coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII made a little history under the revised playoff rules.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII became the first playoff game under the league’s new overtime rules for the postseason, and those changes guaranteed each team a chance to possess the football in overtime. After the San Francisco 49ers kicked a field goal — more on that in a moment — Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs drove down the field and scored the game-winning touchdown on the final play of Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nThat made Super Bowl LVIII the first Super Bowl to see a lead change on the final play of the game.\n\nLooking back at how that unfolded, many wonder if the 49ers should have approached things differently.\n\nSan Francisco won the coin toss, and made the decision to receive the kickoff, despite a prevailing theory that under the new rules it made more sense to defer. With both teams guaranteed a possession, knowing what you need to score to win the game offers a competitive advantage, similar to how teams in college want to start on defense in overtime, so they know what they need to do on offense to win.\n\nInstead, the 49ers began on offense, and could only manage a field goal. That opened the door for the Chiefs to win the game on their guaranteed possession with a touchdown, which is exactly what they did.\n\nSpeaking after the game, San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan stated that the team had run through the various scenarios, and thought by starting on offense they would have the advantage if the game advanced to a third overtime possession, and sudden death.\n\n“None of us have a ton of experience with it,” Shanahan said. “We went through all the analytics and talked to those guys. We decided it would be better getting the ball because if both teams matched and scored, we wanted to be the ones to have a chance to go win it.”\n\nThe problem? The game never got to that third overtime.\n\nLast year, none of the playoff games advanced to overtime, so fans were not treated to another situation like Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nNor did they get a chance to see what, if anything, teams and coaches learned from how that game ended.\n\nAhead of the 2025 NFL season, the league decided to align the overtime rules for the regular season with the approach for the playoffs. However, that change was made “subject to a 10-minute overtime period in the regular season.”\n\nMeaning regular season games could still end in ties, unlike postseason games.\n\nLessons learned from Super Bowl LVIII seemed to come into play during overtime periods in the regular season. One example comes from when the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys went to overtime back in September. Green Bay won the coin toss ahead of overtime but elected to kick, since they were now guaranteed a possession even if Dallas scored a touchdown.\n\nGreen Bay held Dallas to a field goal, giving the Packers a chance to win the game with a touchdown. But when their drive stalled deep in Cowboys’ territory, Green Bay was forced to settle for a game-tying field goal.\n\nOther example from this past regular season indicate that teams will defer in overtime under the new rules. In October the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams went to overtime, with Los Angeles winning the coin toss. Sean McVay and the Rams chose to kick, giving the 49ers possession first.\n\nSan Francisco settled for a field goal, but the Rams were stopped on 4th-and-1 to end the game.\n\nIn November the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons went to overtime, with Carolina winning the toss. Quarterback Bryce Young declared “we want to kick that way,” which was incorrectly granted by the referee. A team can choose to kick, or which end zone to defend, but they cannot choose both.\n\nBut the Panthers indeed started on defense, forced a punt, and then kicked a game-winning field goal on the next drive.\n\nOne scenario that has not been tested yet? The impact of the two-point conversion. After Super Bowl LVIII Kansas City indicated that if necessary, they would have gone for two at the end of their possession to try and win, rather than kick an extra point and extend the game to a third overtime possession.\n\nShould overtime arise in this year’s playoffs, will the two-point conversion come into play?\n\nI guess we will have to wait to find out.",

A big tip of the cap to Head Coach Sean Payton, General Manager George Paton, and the pro and collegiate scouts for helping reforge this roster in relatively short order despite significant limitations due to the implications of the failed Russell Wilson era.\n\nWith second-year signal caller Bo Nix on a rookie contract, ample cap space with the ability to create more, and at least five picks in the top four rounds, the Broncos certainly have great flexibility in how they approach the 2026 NFL Draft. However, what the Broncos eventually do come late April will be highly dependent on what happens in free agency.\n\nAs of now, several defensive starters or players who earned meaningful snap time are scheduled to be unrestricted free agents. Alex Singleton and Justin Strnad at inside linebacker, John Franklin-Myers at defensive end, and safety P.J. Locke. Another significant contributor, standout nickelback Ja’Quan McMillian, is scheduled to be a restricted free agent. I’d expect the Broncos to tender him at least at a second-round level which would give him a big pay raise next season.\n\nAdditional #Broncos to get All-Pro votes:\n\nFB Adam Prentice\nWR Courtland Sutton\nLG Alex Palczewski\nRT Mike McGlinchey\nOLB Nik Bonitto\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian\nPR Marvin Mims Jr.\nLS Mitchell Fraboni\n\n— Aric DiLalla (@AricDiLalla) January 10, 2026\n\nIf Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph winds up being hired for one of the head coaching positions available, it’s safe to say there could be some big roster changes pending who the new defensive coordinator would be. I’d assume that would be Assistant Head Coach and Passing Game Coordinator Jim Leonhard, who is widely regarded as a rising star in the coaching community.\n\nKeeping him in the fold would likely allow for a smoother transition, opting to keep a lot of the same verbiage in place, but adding some more of his unique wrinkles and personalities into the mix defensively. Given the above, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Broncos once again opt to utilize their first-round selection on the defensive side of the ball. Inside linebacker, unless they sign someone in free agency, seems like the easiest position on the roster where you could find a quality return on investment and immediate impact from a draft prospect.\n\nFor those of you who have followed Future Broncos segments this year—you all know it’s one of the better off-ball linebacker classes in ages. The Ohio State duo of Arvell Reese and Sonny Styles played tremendously this season and will likely both be Top 15 selections. Though Texas standout Anthony Hill Jr. and Georgia star CJ Allen would very well be in play for the Broncos where they are currently slated to pick. Either of those two would be phenomenal selections that would definitely brighten Denver’s long-term future at the position.\n\nTexas LB Anthony Hill Jr. will enter the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHill is a projected day 2 draft pick. pic.twitter.com/x6pxGkoluW\n\n— Dane Brugler (@dpbrugler) December 8, 2025\n\nThe Broncos will pick no earlier than 25th overall pending a move up the boards in April. If Joseph is hired by another team as I discussed above, that would give the Broncos a third-round compensatory selection and six selections in the top 150 selections. That’s a lot of draft capital to round out the roster and address future needs.\n\nI’d expect the Broncos to continue their trend of focusing on the trenches. It’s been a premium point of investment since Payton was hired. Garett Bolles and Mike McGlinchey played great this season, but they aren’t getting any younger and it’s been ages since Denver has opted to invest in drafting a tackle. With extra early round selections, I would like to see that finally happen. If Franklin-Myers walks in free agency, finding another defensive end might be wise. Though I’ll say I’ve been impressed with Eyioma Uwazurike this season and think platooning him and Sai’vion Jones next year to replace Myers wouldn’t be a bad idea.\n\nDon’t be surprised to see Denver also add some depth to their secondary. At safety, Brandon Jones and J.L. Skinner will be in the final years of their contracts in ‘26. Additionally, Riley Moss and the aforementioned McMillian will be scheduled to hit free agency after next season as well. Part of the reason Jahdae Barron was selected last season was planning ahead, but the Broncos should be diligent finding another prospect with starting potential on the backend of their defense.\n\nAnd of course, the Broncos’ offense could always use more playmakers. Whether it’s running back, tight end, or wide receiver—raising the floor and long-term prospects of all those position groups would be wise. With extra picks on hand, finding a way to surround Nix with more talent would be a smart call.\n\nWhat do you think, Broncos Country? Do you have an early philosophy for Denver’s 2026 NFL Draft approach? Are there any particular players you are banging the table for with their first-round pick? Sound off in the comments and let me know.",

    "description": "One of Crystal Roure's last acts alive was to tell her 12-year-old son to get out of the house and call 911. Her family believes it saved his life.",
    "fullText": "As a single mom, Crystal Roure was fiercely protective of her children.\n\nSo when she started dating a handsome man from church, Crystal didn’t introduce him right away. In fact, she waited until they had dated for a full year before he met the kids.\n\n“She took her time,\" Crystal's sister, Stephanie Roure, told USA TODAY this week. \"She did have a happy glow that I haven't seen in a long time ... My sister trusted him and fell in love with him. She finally found her happy ever after.\"\n\nBut on Dec. 22, just two years after Crystal married Jason Kenney, he would end up killing her and shooting her 13-year-old daughter in the face in their Florida home − all over an argument about watching a football game three days before Christmas, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Kenney later fatally shot himself.\n\nThe crime during the December holidays shocked the nation.\n\n“The 13-year-old girl begged not to be shot – ‘Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me,’” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a news conference the week of the attack. “And he shot her twice.”\n\nNow as Crystal's family reels from grief and shock, USA TODAY is telling her story and how she used her final moments alive to save her children.\n\nFrom an early age, Crystal Roure showed ambition and a commitment to hard work.\n\nHer sister Stephanie recalled how Crystal did well in school and thrived when she got her first job at T.G.I. Friday's as a teenager, quickly graduating from hostess to server.\n\n\"What set her apart from others was she didn't just work for a paycheck ... she worked for the experience,\" Stephanie said. \"She worked for the knowledge. She worked to prove to herself she was able to do things and not give up.\"\n\nBut when she became a mom at the age of 25, \"everything she did from that moment on was for her children.\"\n\n\"She worked harder and longer,\" Stephanie said. \"And somehow she was superwoman. She managed to hold down a full-time job and being a full-time mother.\"\n\nThough Crystal had to juggle work and the kids all while being single, she didn't miss a school function, award ceremony or field trip. She also managed to buy a house all on her own, \"because she was a smart woman,\" Stephanie said.\n\n\"Her children were her world. She worked hard for them, to provide for them. She protected them,\" she said. \"They came first before anything.\"\n\nEarly in the relationship, Facebook photos show the pair smiling and kissing each other in many selfies. Other show them and the kids looking like a picture-perfect family, posing in front of a Christmas tree and at a baseball game.\n\nBut sometime after they married on Nov. 4, 2023, Stephanie said: \"My sister lost that glow she had.\"\n\nAt first, Stephanie chalked up the change to the fact that Crystal became pregnant with her third child pretty quickly after the wedding.\n\n\"I remember asking her, 'Are you OK?'\" Stephanie said. \"She said, 'Yes,' it's just this pregnancy was really kicking her butt because she was much older.\"\n\nThough Stephanie said she always had an \"ehh\" feeling about Kenney, she thought her sister was happy and safe.\n\nThat is until she got the worst phone call of her life.\n\nCrystal and her three kids spent the evening of Dec. 22 by the Christmas tree at their home in Highland City, just east of Tampa. Meanwhile Kenney was in his shed, drinking and watching Monday Night Football until about 11 p.m., Sheriff Judd said.\n\nWhen Kenney went inside the home and wanted to continue watching the game, a fight ensued. It became so scary that Crystal told her 12-year-old son to run to a neighbor's house and call 911, Judd said.\n\nAs the boy ran out, he heard the first gunshot. Responding deputies found Crystal dead inside, her 13-year-old daughter shot in the face and shoulder, and Jason Kenney gone. They also found a letter Crystal wrote to her husband telling him: \"You're drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God.\"\n\nThe 1-year-old daughter the couple shared was unharmed. The 13-year-old survived the gunshot wound after the bullet hit the bridge of her nose and deflected through the top of her head, Judd said.\n\nAfter shooting his wife and step-daughter, Kenney drove in his truck to his late father's home and called his sister to say he had \"done something very, very bad\" and that it was the last time they would ever talk, Judd said.\n\nDeputies tracked Kenney down to a shed on his father's property. When they called for him to come out, they heard a single gunshot and found Kenney dead inside.\n\nJudd said that a relative told deputies that Kenney had been beating on Crystal \"for a while,\" though the sheriff's office has no records of any domestic violence calls or charges. Jason Kenney had no criminal history, Judd said.\n\n\"He absolutely destroyed a family,\" Judd said. \"When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under the tree, just like the nuclear family should be ... and it ends up this way.\"\n\nCrystal's family is leaning on each other as they absorb the shock of her murder and raising funds for the children. Crystal's 13-year-old daughter \"is doing well on her recovery\" and \"it really is a miracle that the bullet missed every major thing,\" Stephanie said.\n\nAs for any abuse leading up to the tragedy, Stephanie said it's possible but she wasn't aware of any.\n\n\"After they were married I know she said he was drinking a lot more but she said that he was going to stop and said he would get help with it. Obviously that didn't happen,\" she said, adding that when she went over to visit, Kenney would \"sit outside in the shed playing games on his phone and smoking his cigarettes.\"\n\n\"If there was abuse happening he must have scared her to the point not to say or do anything because the type of person my sister was she would have left at the first sight of trouble because she would protect her kids,\" she said. \"But that's a question we'll never have answers to.\"\n\nStephanie said she's angry that Kenney killed her sister and tried to kill her niece but that she's so proud of Crystal and her nephew's actions that night.\n\n\"My sister died a hero for protecting her children and getting my nephew out of the house to make the 911 call,\" she said. \"She did that. She saved their lives and by doing so my nephew saved his sister's life, and thank God the baby was untouched.\"\n\nStephanie said she is going to do her best to teach her 1-year-old niece all about who her mom was.\n\n\"I will never let these kids forget the love and strength and courage she had for them,\" she said. \"They will always know that she loved them and put them first.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Florida mom of three killed by husband over NFL game 'died a hero'",

    "fullText": "Super Wild Card Weekend in the NFL is built for chaos — and chaos creates opportunity for bettors willing to chase longshot value.\n\nOur experts have identified four longshot NFL picks with the potential to boost your ROI as three straight days of knockout football take center stage.\n\nTrevor Lawrence 3+ passing TDs (+350 at FanDuel)\n\nTommy Tremble anytime TD (+650 at FanDuel)\n\nDalton Schultz first TD (+850 at FanDuel)\n\nEach team to score 1+ rushing touchdown (+12500 at FanDuel)\n\nTrevor Lawrence 3+ passing touchdowns (+350)\n\nTrevor Lawrence has thrown three or more scores in three of his last four games. He’s also piled up 10 passing TDs over his last three home starts, with this pass-catching group playing its best football of the season.\n\nParker Washington has 347 yards over the last three games, Jakobi Meyers continues to move the chains, and Brian Thomas remains a matchup problem. Add in Brenton Strange and Travis Etienne as a receiving threat, and there are plenty of ways for this offense to score.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are banged up in the secondary, with rookie Maxwell Hairston out and Jordan Poyer questionable, plus linebacker Terrel Bernard missing practice. If the Bills sell out to stop the run, Lawrence should be forced to throw — and that sets up well for another strong passing day.\n\nTommy Tremble anytime TD (+650)\n\nThis is a massive price for a clear-cut TE1 on a team that should be throwing more than usual as a double-digit home underdog.\n\nIn his first game without Ja’Tavion Sanders, Tremble stepped into the TE1 role and caught three of four targets for 38 yards and a TD at +500. Tommy Tremble ranked third in route share and logged a 90% snap rate, second among pass catchers.\n\nHe’s clearly involved yet priced like a TE2 with minimal usage. With Sanders still on IR, this should be closer to +300 or +330.\n\nAfter missing Week 18, Nico Collins returns to the Texans' lineup on Monday. But even with their star wideout back, we still need to consider tight end Dalton Schultz a live option to score the opener against the Steelers.\n\nHe’s only scored three times all season, but two of those have come in the past month. He ranks second on the Texans roster in red-zone targets across the year.\n\nWith the Steelers giving up 11 touchdowns to TEs this season, tied for third-most in the league, it could be a good Monday for the former Stanford man.\n\nEach team to score 1+ rushing TD (+12500)\n\nYou can’t write a longshot article without one true lotto ticket, and Wild Card Weekend sets up perfectly for a swing like this.\n\nAcross the six-game slate, we’re looking at a mix of run-heavy offenses, potential weather spots, and elite ground games capable of dictating terms through both scheme and talent.\n\nThis bet leans on proven touchdown producers like Kyren Williams (10), Rico Dowdle (6), Josh Jacobs (13), D’Andre Swift (9), James Cook (12), Josh Allen (14), Travis Etienne (7), Trevor Lawrence (9), Christian McCaffrey (10), Saquon Barkley (7), Jalen Hurts (8), and TreVeyon Henderson (9).\n\nIt’s a sprinkle-only play — but if Wild Card chaos hits the right way, this is the kind of ticket that can cap the weekend with a massive ROI.\n\nMake your NFL bets at FanDuel, America's No. 1 sportsbook! \n\nChargers vs Patriots predictions\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos secured the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs after going 14-3 in the regular season. They now enter the NFL playoffs, and there's no room for error in the win-or-go-home format.\n\nLast year, the Broncos made the playoffs for the first time since 2015, but they were promptly eliminated in the wild-card round. Now back in the postseason, they're looking to make a deep run with home-field advantage.\n\n“It’s just a mindset, I believe,\" cornerback Pat Surtain said when asked what changes for a player in the playoffs. \"We all realize in a tournament it’s do or die. It’s really almost zero margin of error once you’re in the tournament. We feel like, as a team we have a lot to correct and a lot to adjust, but at the end of the day, we are glad we have home-field advantage. You need as much of an advantage going into the playoffs. That’s a huge part of it, securing the No. 1 seed and getting home-field advantage. That’s big time for us. I feel like we aren’t a finished product. We aren’t where we want to be yet. Like I said before, I feel like we are very dangerous knowing that we have home-field advantage right in front of us.”\n\nAfter a first-round bye, Denver will host the lowest advancing seed from the AFC in the divisional round next week. The Broncos will face either the Los Angeles Chargers (No. 7), Buffalo Bills (No. 6), Houston Texans (No. 5) or Pittsburgh Steelers (No. 4) on either Jan. 17 or Jan. 18.

    "fullText": "Are the NFL's overtime rules needlessly complex? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNFL overtime was supposed to make games fairer. Instead, it has become one of the most confusing and overbuilt systems in professional sports — especially in the playoffs, where the rules quietly change again and grow even more complicated.\n\nWhat should be a simple extension of the game now feels like a rulebook within the rulebook.\n\nOvertime still begins with a coin toss, and the winner isn’t just choosing who gets the ball — they can also choose to defer or even pick which end of the field to defend. Before a single snap is played, layers of strategy and technicalities are already in motion.\n\nUnder the current system, both teams are guaranteed at least one possession, even if the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown. That team must then kick off and allow the opponent a chance to respond. The only way the game can end immediately is if the defense scores a safety on the opening possession — another rare and oddly specific exception that fans must remember.\n\nThe postseason adds even more complexity. Overtime periods are 15 minutes instead of 10. If a team’s guaranteed possession is still ongoing when time expires, it simply carries over into another overtime period. The game is treated like a continuation of regulation, complete with three timeouts per team, two-minute warnings, and end-of-half clock rules. If the game remains tied, teams line up for yet another kickoff, with only a brief two-minute “halftime” if a second overtime is reached. And in the extremely unlikely event that four overtime periods are played, another coin toss resets the format yet again.\n\nAll of this exists in the name of fairness — but fairness has slowly been confused with overcorrection.\n\nThe NFL has rewritten its overtime rules multiple times over the years, most notably after Josh Allen never touched the ball in the Bills’ playoff loss to the Chiefs. That game sparked the guaranteed-possession rule, fundamentally changing overtime strategy. But in doing so, the league didn’t just tweak a flaw — it created a system that increasingly minimizes the need to actually play defense. Now, if you win the toss and have a capable offense, you’re almost guaranteed to at least extend the game, regardless of whether your defense can get a stop.\n\nAt some point, the league has to ask whether it’s designing rules for competition — or designing them around star players who feel they were wronged.\n\nIf the NFL is going to adjust overtime every time a high-profile quarterback is unhappy with how a season ended, it might as well take the next logical step and adopt the NCAA overtime model. College football’s system is cleaner. It’s clearer. And most importantly, it’s more exciting. Both teams know exactly what they’re getting: equal opportunities, immediate pressure, and a true test of execution in scoring situations.\n\nFootball thrives on simplicity — move the ball, stop the ball, score more points, win the game. The current NFL overtime system has drifted far from that. What was meant to be fair has become bloated, confusing, and increasingly disconnected from the core of the sport. If overtime is going to feel this manufactured anyway, the league may as well choose a model that fans can actually understand — and enjoy.",

    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl was a clash between No. 5 Oregon and No. 1 Indiana. It was also a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 picks of Yahoo Sports' latest NFL mock draft.\n\nIn both cases, it's pretty safe to say who came out on top.\n\nIndiana reached the national title game with a 56-22 demolishing of the Ducks, taking a four-touchdown lead into halftime and coasting from there. Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the favorite to be the Las Vegas Raiders' first overall pick in a few months, was 17-for-20 for 177 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and 0 interceptions.\n\nAnd Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, the projected second pick? He was 24-for-39 with 285 passing yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 backbreaking turnovers. It's safe to say the performance didn't help the redshirt sophomore's draft stock.\n\nWhen asked about his draft decision after the game, Moore said he hadn't made a decision yet.\n\n“At the end of the day, I don’t know my decision yet.”\n\nDante Moore on his future ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/W1r22EaepO\n\n— FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) January 10, 2026\n\n\"I'm going to soak this moment up and, most importantly, give my hugs and thank yous to my teammates. But at the end of the day, I don't know my decision yet. I'm going to talk to coach Lanning and talk to my family and everybody, but at the end of the day I don't want to think about that right now.\"\n\nAs of now, Moore still looms as a candidate to go second overall to the New York Jets, but his performance on Friday laid bare some concerns around his game.\n\nAfter a rough freshman year at UCLA and a redshirt year under Dillon Gabriel last season, Moore had impressed all season with his arm strength, accuracy, athleticism and command of the Oregon offense. However, he was never pressured in the pocket like he was against Indiana, and the results were ugly.\n\n— Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) January 10, 2026\n\nOregon would surely welcome Moore back for a junior season and at only 20 years old, he still has plenty of time to get to the NFL. The decision is shaping up to be one of the biggest among all underclassmen in this year's draft cycle.\n\nAs for Mendoza, you can probably guess where he's going after a dream season in which he's led Indiana to a 15-0 record while winning the Heisman Trophy.",

Denver’s success largely stems from its harrowing defense, which surrendered fewer points than all but two teams. The Broncos boast a host of gifted talents across their rearguard, from reigning Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II to linebacking standouts Alex Singleton and Nik Bonitto.\n\nSean Payton’s side fancies itself a Super Bowl contender.

It's anyone's guess at the moment.\n\nAfter finishing with a 14-3 record and outgunning the Patriots via tiebreakers, Denver landed the top seed in the AFC. That gives Sean Payton's side home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, as well as a bye week during the wild-card round.

    "fullText": "This season's NFL play-offs begin at the weekend and here BBC columnist Phoebe Schecter gives her predictions for the six games on Wildcard Weekend.\n\nAll kick-off times GMT, Conference seed in brackets\n\nLos Angeles Rams (5) @ Carolina Panthers (4) - 21:30\n\nThis is a rematch from week 13, but I don't think it's fair to look at that 31-28 win for the Panthers. They managed to stay alive in the play-off hunt but their defence has kind of been the reason they've stayed in most of their games, rather than their quarterback Bryce Young.\n\nThe Rams are one of the Super Bowl favourites and I think their defence is going to be the final nail in the coffin for Carolina.\n\nMatt Stafford is one of the leading MVP contenders and Puka Nacua leads the league for receptions. He's just so physical in taking contested catches. His one-handed catches are incredible.\n\nThe Rams have struggled in the red zone in recent weeks without Davante Adams but he's set to come back so, for me, it's a clear Rams win.\n\nGreen Bay Packers (7) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 01:00 Sun\n\nThis is going to be awesome. They're divisional rivals and it's the NFL's oldest rivalry, so there's so much familiarity. That's what makes it so exciting.\n\nThey've played each other twice in the last five weeks and they're 1-1. The Packers almost beat the Bears in week 16, and that was after Micah Parsons' injury and being without Jordan Love for most of the game (concussion).\n\nCaleb Williams is doing such a great job with his game management, his athleticism, the way the ball just jumps out of his hand, and his receivers are coming together, so I have the Bears on this one.\n\nThey have had the most fourth-quarter comebacks in a season (six) and their defence leads the league with 33 takeaways. They'll probably need to get a couple more against Jordan Love to really seal the deal.\n\nLive text commentary on all play-off games on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live radio commentary on selected games on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. The Whole 10 Yards, BBC Sport's weekly NFL programme, will also follow the road to Super Bowl 60\n\nBuffalo Bills (6) @ Jacksonville Jaguars (3) - 18:00\n\nWith Kansas City, Cincinnati and Baltimore not in the play-offs, this is the clearest route to the Super Bowl the Bills have had, but this is a scary Jags team.\n\nThey've won their last eight, so they're the team that has momentum. They're having fun out there, and we've never seen this version of Trevor Lawrence before, the way he's finishing in the red zone. He looks so confident.\n\nThe Jags have been clicking on all three phases since their bye week. They brought in Jakobi Myers and the Bills have to stop Travis Etienne running all over them.\n\nBut I still have so much faith in Josh Allen. We've seen it so many times, where he comes to life in the fourth quarter, and it's hard to bet against him. So I'm going for my Bills, especially because I'll be working at the game – and I can't stand the thought of them losing!\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (6) @ Philadelphia Eagles (3) - 21:30\n\nGiven their injuries, coach Kyle Shanahan has been incredible to get the 49ers where they are. They have done a great job of staying afloat with their defence, but I just don't know how sustainable it is.\n\nHaving slipped from potentially the top seed to the sixth, Shanahan's been like 'we've just got to do it the hard way'. This must mean so much to them because of the 2023 NFC Championship game in Philly, when Brock Purdy got injured and Christian McCaffrey had to play quarterback.\n\nI don't think the Eagles are going to do anything fancy. They're going to run the ball, get the play-action to throw outside to their receivers and then play great defence.\n\nIt's not cute, it's not exciting, but they just know how to win. I have a lot of faith in Jalen Hurts and their defence, so I'm going Eagles.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (7) @ New England Patriots (2) - 01:00 Mon\n\nPlaying at New England is tough in the cold and I think that makes a big difference. I don't know how much further the Patriots will go, but I think they'll win this.\n\nJustin Herbert's been hit so many times. The Chargers' offensive line has just not been able to protect him. Like the Bills, their receivers haven't been able to get separation. It's like Herbert's the magic man again, whereas at least the Patriots have some receivers, and Drake Maye has been phenomenal.\n\nI think he's earned the MVP because it's a great story. He's with a franchise that's not been itself since Tom Brady left and it's unbelievable what he's done in his second year.\n\nYou can only say their schedule has been easy so many times. You still have to beat the teams in front of you, and he's been decisive, he's stepping up in the pocket and the way he throws the ball is beautiful.\n\nWhy the NFL play-offs are the 'most unusual' in years\n\nHouston Texans (5) @ Pittsburgh Steelers (4) - 01:00 Tue\n\nThe Steelers' win on Sunday was wild, but I think we have the same conversation around them every year. Mike Tomlin's done a great job, they've got a winning record again and got to the play-offs, but for so long it's not been more than that.\n\nI'm going for the Texans because of their defence, it's just ferocious. Danielle Hunter has 15 sacks, Will Anderson is second in the NFL with a career-high 85 QB pressures, and they have four players with four interceptions. That's a crazy stat - which of their defensive backs do you throw towards?\n\nAaron Rodgers is doing tons trying to get the Steelers' offence on the same page but they're still having miscues. DK Metcalf is back from suspension but I just don't see them having enough firepower to compete with this defence.\n\nIt's the main reason the Texans could make it deep into the play-offs. They can cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Weather could make it difficult for both quarterbacks, which puts an emphasis on the running game. Maye should get more help in that regard than Justin Herbert.",
    "fullText": "Welcome back to the playoffs, New England Patriots.\n\nThe last time we saw the Patriot Way grace us this deep into January, New England got drilled in Buffalo with Mac Jones leading the way at quarterback in the 2021 season. New England's last postseason home game happened to be the last time we saw Tom Brady in a Patriots uniform, suffering an upset loss to Mike Vrabel and the Tennessee Titans in the 2019 season’s playoffs.\n\nSpeaking of Vrabel, he's back, this time in familiar digs as New England's head coach. But all eyes will be mainly focused on his quarterback, Drake Maye, who is in a tight MVP race with the Los Angeles Rams' Matthew Stafford.\n\nThe Chargers and Patriots didn’t play each other this season. The two teams matched up late in 2024 with Los Angeles winning decisively in New England, 40-7. Maye passed for only 117 yards, his worst game as a full-time starter during his rookie season.\n\nOn the other side, Justin Herbert posted the kind of performance the Chargers will need from him Sunday night. He threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns, two of those scoring passes going to Ladd McConkey, who finished with 94 yards. J.K. Dobbins (now with the Broncos) rushed for 76 yards.\n\nThe Patriots have no major injuries to deal with going into Sunday. But five players missed practice this week due to illness and the team will hope more don’t come down with a bug leading up to kickoff. For the Chargers, starting running back Omarion Hampton — the team’s second-leading rusher — hasn’t practiced all week due to an ankle issue that sidelined him for eight games this season. Edge rusher Bud Dupree has also missed practice.\n\nIt’s Michigan vs. Ohio State on the opposing sidelines.\n\nVrabel is a leading candidate for Coach of the Year honors after turning New England around from a 4-13 slog in 2024 to a 13-4 resurgence this season. He has a 3-5 playoff record, which includes the Tennessee Titans’ run to the AFC championship game in the 2019 season. Harbaugh boasts a 5-4 mark, which includes three consecutive NFC championship games with the San Francisco 49ers and an appearance in Super Bowl XLVII. Yet the Chargers lost in last season’s wild-card round, 32-12, to the Houston Texans.\n\nAs Herbert goes, so do the Chargers. Last season, he threw four interceptions in Los Angeles’ playoff defeat. This season, when he didn’t play well, the Chargers typically couldn’t overcome those poor performances. (The lone exception was Week 14’s 22-19 overtime win over the Philadelphia Eagles, in which Herbert threw for only 139 yards.) However, the Patriots may provide an ideal matchup for Herbert to shine. New England allowed 4,459 passing yards this season and 8.9 yards per throw, both worst in the AFC. And only the Bengals gave up more TD passes (36) this season than the Patriots’ 31 among conference teams.\n\nMaye has been viewed as an MVP candidate throughout the season. But he’ll face the NFL’s fourth-best pass defense (3,314 yards allowed) in the Chargers. Only two other teams had more interceptions than the 19 Los Angeles grabbed this season. So the Patriots may have to run the ball to win. That could suit them well, as they compiled the third-most rushing yards in the AFC. TreVeyon Henderson led the team with 911 yards and nine TDs. He ran for a season-high 148 yards and two scores in Week 15 versus the Bills.\n\nNew England was actually better on the road (8-0) this season than at home (6-3). But temperatures in Foxborough, Massachusetts, are expected to be in the mid-30s by Sunday’s 8 p.m. ET kickoff, which isn’t ideal for a team coming from Los Angeles.\n\nThe conditions could make it difficult for both quarterbacks, which puts an emphasis on the running game. Maye should get more help in that regard than Herbert. The Patriots’ ability to control the line of scrimmage on offense with two talented running backs capable of rushing for 100 yards could be the difference.",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza vs. Dante Moore: The key stats you need to know in 2026 NFL Draft debate originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza and Dante Moore didn't have much of a Big Ten quarterback duel when Indiana beat Oregon in the college football regular season. But now that both QBs have led their teams to playoff semifinals, a lot more is at stake.\n\nWhen Mendoza's Hoosiers have their rematch with Moore's Ducks in Friday's Peach Bowl in Atlanta, there will be a trip to the national championship game at stake. The outcome and the related performances will also help determine which QB goes to the top of the draft class in 2026.\n\nWith the Las Vegas Raiders and New York Jets having the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks and badly needing quarterbacks, the franchises will spend a lot of time on vetting Mendoza vs. Moore.\n\nBetween arm strength, accuracy, pocket presence and intangibles, there's a lot to like about Mendoza (6-5, 225), the Heisman Trophy winner, and Moore, a well-rounded talent. But their head-to-head stats will no doubt have some influence on who ends up coming off the board first.\n\nHere's looking at their seasons before playing again, including what happened in the previous matchup on Oct. 11:\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT: Where Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore land in latest projections\n\nMoore had more volume, but in terms of efficiency and every other category, Mendoza stood out as the worthy Heisman winner, with Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Ohio State's Julian Sayin making the cut over Moore as finalists. Neither Mendoza nor Moore would be considered dual threats with their running, but they have enough wheels to extend pass plays and rush for key yardage in big moments.\n\nHere are the numbers both QBs put when facing each other's tough defenses back on Oct. 11, played at Oregon's Autzen Stadium:\n\nThat wasn't the best showcase game for either QB, given the respective degrees of difficulty. Mendoza did outplay Moore. Expect both QBs to perform much better as more seasoned and playoff-winning passers almost three months later.\n\nMORE: Five players to watch in the Indiana vs. Oregon CPF semifinal\n\nThe Raiders already are on the clock for April 23 in Pittsburgh. Given the influence of former Big Ten passer Tom Brady as part-owner, he has a tough decision to make for the new face of the franchise. Mendoza, given his gritty profile and clutch confidence, would seem to fit better as the Raiders' savior.\n\nMoore, meanwhile, might be the right QB on whom the Jets can take a shot with his mental and physical attributes to deliver for Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand, who coached Jared Goff in Detroit. Another QB such as Alabama's Ty Simpson could emerge in the conversation, but for now, Mendoza is the man.\n\nThere's a long way to go in the draft process, however, including the Combine and pro days. Mendoza vs. Moore started off mild, but it's become red-hot on the biggest stages.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal",

    "description": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.\n\nThe NFL has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court as to the question of whether the civil action filed in February 2022 by former Dolphins coach (and current Vikings defensive coordinator) Brian Flores against the NFL, the Dolphins, the Giants, the Broncos, and the Texans will be resolved in court, or in arbitration.\n\nThe specific legal question presented to the Supreme Court is this: \"Whether an arbitration agreement governing disputes in a professional sports league is categorically unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act because it designates the league commissioner as the default arbitrator and permits the commissioner to develop arbitral procedures.\"\n\nThe NFL has wisely narrowed the question, given that the reasoning (if applied throughout corporate America) would empower other companies to attempt to rig the in-house arbitration process by putting employment disputes in the hands of the CEO. Still, the league's position is clear — it wants the Commissioner to retain power over disputes involving the NFL and the various teams that have hired and that handsomely compensate the Commissioner.\n\nThe 25-page document is the first step in an effort to persuade the Supreme Court to take up the case. Of the many petitions it receives each year, few are accepted.\n\nMore time will pass as the Supreme Court considers whether to take the case. Even more time will pass if the Supreme Court grants the petition.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit invalidated the NFL's arbitration provision, concluding that the procedure lacks independence. (And it does.) The Supreme Court, if it takes the case, will decide once and for all whether it's legitimate for the NFL (and any sports league) to put its Commissioner in charge of claims made against the NFL.\n\nIt's fundamentally unfair to delegate those powers to someone whose connection to one side of a legal fight is so obvious. Frankly, no Commissioner should want to be expected to set aside their clear self-interests in an effort to dispense justice in an objective way.\n\nBut this has been the league's practice, for years. It desperately wants to run its own business. It desperately hopes to hold the gavel when it comes to deciding whether the legal claims against it are valid.\n\nIt's a bad way to do business. It's now for the Supreme Court to decide whether it's a good way, or a bad way, to apply the laws of the United States.",

    "fullText": "The President of the United States is officially \"warning\" all 32 teams across the National Football League.\n\nPresident Trump, 79, is not happy with the Baltimore Ravens firing John Harbaugh. He's warning both the Ravens - and the rest of the league - that they will be making a big mistake if they don't hire him. President Trump is a major fan of the Super Bowl-winning head coach.\n\nWhile some have told political figures to stay out of sports, President Trump is very much making his presence felt. The President of the United States is expected to pressure NFL teams into hiring John Harbaugh. President Trump has a close relationship with many prominent NFL owners.\n\nPresident Trump issued his official \"warning\" to the 32 NFL franchises on social media this week, following Harbaugh's firing.\n\n\"HIRE JOHN HARBAUGH, FAST,\" Trump warned. \"HE AND HIS BROTHER, ARE TOTAL WINNERS!!!\"\n\nJohn Harbaugh has previously shown love for President Trump and the White House.\n\nHarbaugh, who led the Ravens to a Super Bowl win in 2013, visited the White House over the summer.\n\n\"How you framed that question — I would have framed that question like: 'You got a chance to go visit with the president, man. What was that experience like?'\" Harbaugh said in response to a reporter asking him about visiting with President Trump, who had been critical of Baltimore.\n\n\"It was amazing. It was awesome. And I promise you I root for our president. I want our president to be successful just like I want my quarterback to be successful and I want my team to be successful, and it was an amazing experience.\"\n\nHis brother, Jim Harbaugh, has met more U.S. Presidents.\n\n\"He's got seven, I got four. I had a chance to meet President Obama twice — incredible experience. Had a chance to meet President Biden when he was vice president in Iraq, and spent a lot of time with him in Iraq,\" he said. \"Jim got invited also to the White House to meet President Reagan because he was a Heisman Trophy candidate. We got to go as a family, so I met President Reagan — have a picture in my office of that.\"",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have smashed preseason expectations in head coach Mike Vrabel’s first year.\n\nThey secured the AFC’s No. 2 seed and will host the Los Angeles Chargers at Gillette Stadium in the Wildcard round on Sunday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it will be second-year quarterback Drake Maye’s NFL postseason debut. But it will be far from Maye’s first truly meaningful game.\n\nIn 2022, the then-20-year-old quarterback squared off with the college football juggernauts that are the Clemson Tigers in the ACC Conference Championship game.\n\nIt was Maye’s sophomore year at the University of North Carolina, and he had brought the Tar Heels to a 9-3 record and a top-25 ranking.\n\nMaye was asked during his Wednesday afternoon press conference what he learned from that experience.\n\n“Maybe a little bit,” Maye said when asked if that college experience correlates to his NFL playoff debut. “Getting back to trying to play for championships… I think it’s a little bit different in the NFL.\n\n“Just the mentality of ‘win or go home’ or ‘win and advance,’ and I think that’s the biggest thing that’s different. In the ACC Championship, you go to a bowl game. Here it’s (win) now, or you’re going home.”\n\nMaye was unable to win the conference championship in 2022, and, as he alluded to, earned a second chance in a game against Bo Nix’s 15th-ranked Oregon Ducks.\n\nMaye threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns in the 2022 Holiday Bowl. He led his team to a 24-10 fourth-quarter lead and added three points on his final drive of the game.\n\nThe defense was unable to stop the Ducks’ two-minute drill as Nix threw the game-winning touchdown with 19 seconds on the clock and beat the Tar Heels 28-27.\n\nDrake Maye Silences Emerging Narrative About Patriots-Chargers Matchup",

    "fullText": "After 18 seasons, the Baltimore Ravens decided to move on from future Hall of Fame coach John Harbaugh, who won 180 games and a Super Bowl. He’s undoubtedly the best head coaching candidate available in a league that now has seven vacancies, including the Ravens.\n\nThe Ravens fired Harbaugh so they could hire someone else. Now, another NFL team is reportedly weighing the decision to fire its coach and hire Harbaugh. But which team it is remains unclear.\n\nAccording to Harbaugh’s agent Bryan Harlan, Harbaugh’s availability has already prompted seven calls from NFL teams that have interest in the former Ravens coach. Yet again, only seven teams have vacancies, and the Ravens obviously aren’t calling to say they want him back now.\n\nThis means there’s another team that has yet to move on their head coach, who is currently pondering a switcheroo. That is, if Harbaugh’s agent is telling the truth.\n\nOf course, it’s his job to drive up the price for his client and make it seem like he’s the best thing since sliced bread. Still, it’s not that hard to believe that a team could be interested in upgrading to Harbaugh, who ranks 14th on the NFL’s all-time coaching wins list.\n\nThere’s still speculation that the Pittsburgh Steelers and Mike Tomlin could be headed for a split. How fun would it be for Harbaugh to head to one of the Ravens’ biggest rivals? After all, he knows this division like the back of his hand.\n\nIf not the Steelers, what about a team like the New York Jets? They can’t be too sold on Aaron Glenn after a 3-14 season. Possibly even the Miami Dolphins after Mike McDaniel’s poor start to the 2025 NFL campaign. Though, since McDaniel’s been involved in the GM hiring process, that would be an awkward split.\n\nWe don’t imagine the Indianapolis Colts are thinking about a coaching change after Shane Steichen proved he could lead a dominant effort with improved QB play, even if it was just for a stretch of the season. Yet, anything’s possible.\n\nWould the Washington Commanders consider a change after the bottom fell out on Dan Quinn’s team after they lost eight games in a row? A year after reaching the NFC Conference Championship, we doubt Quinn’s job is in danger this offseason.\n\nThat leaves the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who have been pretty silent on the future of Todd Bowles, though he believes he deserves a shot at another season. After seeing the offense and defense regress and failing to take control of a division that was clearly up for grabs, perhaps the Buccaneers are a team that’s silently pondering a change.\n\nIn any event, this unknown team is operating in the shadows. But quietly, they’re likely hoping Harbaugh says yes to them before moving on from the coach they’re already committed to.\n\nWith Harbaugh shaking things up, could there soon be eight NFL head coaching vacancies, leaving a quarter of the jobs up for grabs? Would that then spur someone like Bill Belichick’s interest?\n\nBill Belichick Addresses Rumored Interest in NFL Head Coaching Vacancies\n\nNY Giants Must Stop Flirting With Kevin Stefanski, Hire John Harbaugh Right Now\n\nNew York Giants Spending Lots of Time With Top Coaching Candidate",

By ground, No. 38 broke off 131 rushing yards and a pair of visits to the end zone. By air, he added 22 receiving yards and another score on a sluggo route.\n\nLongs of 56 and 35 yards were among them for Stevenson. The starting back would be the lone player around the league to log three touchdowns from scrimmage in Week 18. He finished with 104 rushing yards over expectation, per Next Gen Stats, and was charted by Pro Football Focus for forcing four missed tackles on his handoffs.\n\nIt marks the first weekly honor for the No. 120 overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft. A former transfer from Cerritos College to the University of Oklahoma, Stevenson checks in as the first Sooners product to win AFC or NFC Offensive Player of the Week this campaign. He joins nine-time winner Adrian Peterson and four-time winner Joe Mixon in the school’s archives at running back.\n\nBetween all three phases, Stevenson is also the sixth different member of the Patriots to get such a call this season.\n\nThe conference’s No. 2 seed was previously represented by kickoff returner Antonio Gibson in Week 2, punt returner Marcus Jones in Week 4, outside linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson in Week 7, kicker Andy Borregales in Week 12 and quarterback Drake Maye in Week 13.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers visit head coach Mike Vrabel’s group in Foxborough on Sunday.

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs could upgrade their wide receiver room by selecting Georgia State Panthers star Ted Hurst in the 2026 NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs used significant draft picks on wide receivers in recent years but need to invest in the position during the 2026 NFL draft. With Marquise Brown, Travis Kelce, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton all entering free agency, the team desperately needs another quality pass catcher capable of elevating the offense.\n\nGeorgia State Panthers wide receiver Ted Hurst is a more well-rounded receiver than Thornton and more explosive than Smith-Schuster. His 6’3”, 195 lbs. frame also separates him from existing members of the Chiefs wide receiver room. Hurst projects as a top 100 selection who should grow into a contributor by the mid-point of his rookie season.\n\nHurst explodes off the line of scrimmage and displays the agile footwork to work across the faces of cornerbacks during his release. He lacks elite speed but uses his initial burst to overtake and stack cornerbacks. While Hurst’s speed isn’t special, he succeeded in stretching the field and generating chunk gains with his long strides at Georgia State.\n\nGeorgia State WR Ted Hurst is my #1 offensive prospect from the G5. \n\n- 6’3/195 \n- goal line fade machine\n- crisp route runner with sudden deceleration\n- elusive after the catch (17 mtkl forced this year)\n- burst to stack press-man\n- good not great top gear\n- cuts routes off vs.… pic.twitter.com/LvUgymsCJO\n\n— James Foster (@NoFlagsFilm) November 15, 2025\n\nDespite being a taller receiver, Hurst sinks his hips well at the top of the route stem and executes effective cuts and route fakes. His route definition occasionally suffers on digs, but he generates natural separation on curls and comebacks.\n\nHurst regularly finds open space against zone coverage and runs his routes to precise depths to move the chains. His work against press coverage needs to improve. The Georgia native is lean and lacks the play strength to power through jams at the line of scrimmage. This makes it easier for cornerbacks to re-route him and impact the timing of the offense’s plays.\n\nHurst caught 61.1% of his contested targets over the past two years. He isn’t a bully at the catch point but tracks the ball well and makes great adjustments to secure receptions through contact. Hurst drops easier receptions due to lapses of concentration, but he dials in for contested opportunities.\n\nHurst lacks the mass and power to break tackles after the catch, but his long strides and agility make him a threat to find open space and gash defenses. He uses jump cuts and his springy footwork to evade defenders while probing for room to run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL draft scouting report: Georgia State Panthers WR Ted Hurst",

After Nick Saban left Alabama, Downs decided to transfer to Ohio State, where he was a two-time All-American.\n\nDowns' father, Gary Downs, was an NFL running back for seven seasons. His brother, Josh Downs, is a wide receiver for the Colts. His uncle, Dre Bly, was an NFL cornerback for 11 seasons.

    "description": "The Steelers’ potential next quarterback has declared for the draft.",
    "fullText": "The search for the Pittsburgh Steelers’ quarterback of the future may soon gain another intriguing option.\n\nWith 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers nearing the twilight of his decorated career, the Steelers are widely expected to explore long-term solutions at quarterback this offseason, whether through free agency or the draft. On Tuesday, one potential answer officially entered the conversation when Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson announced via Instagram that he will declare for the 2026 NFL Draft after his first season as the Crimson Tide’s full-time starter.\n\nSimpson authored a standout campaign at Alabama, leading the SEC in completions (305) while throwing for 3,567 yards and accounting for 30 total touchdowns to just five interceptions. He guided the Crimson Tide to their first College Football Playoff victory since 2021 with a win over Oklahoma, though his postseason run ended on a sour note after he struggled and exited with an injury in Alabama’s quarterfinal loss.\n\nTy Simpson was super active pre-snap v. LSU. His pre-snap recognition was a consistent strength.\n\nSenses the impending blitz here. As soon as he sees the nickel coming, he knows the safety spacing is too wide to account for the sit route inside the slot fade. Places it perfectly. pic.twitter.com/7OAkE2g4QX\n\n— Ian Cummings (@IC_Draft) November 11, 2025\n\nDespite that setback, Simpson’s draft stock remains strong. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. currently ranks Simpson as the No. 3 quarterback in the incoming class, slotting him behind Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and Oregon’s Dante Moore — both of whom are competing in the College Football Playoff semifinals and have yet to officially declare.\n\nGiven Pittsburgh’s likely draft position, the Steelers are not expected to be realistic contenders for Mendoza or Moore, making Simpson an especially compelling name to watch as draft season approaches. His blend of production, poise, and experience against elite competition has already sparked conversation around Pittsburgh as the organization evaluates succession plans behind Rodgers. There are, however, concerns about his lack of experience and durability.\n\nThe timing only adds to the intrigue. The 2026 NFL Draft will be held in Pittsburgh, placing the franchise firmly in the national spotlight as it navigates one of the most consequential roster decisions of the coming era.\n\nWhether Simpson ultimately becomes the next quarterback to don black and gold remains to be seen. But as the offseason begins to take shape, his declaration ensures the Steelers — and their fans — will be paying close attention.",

    "description": "Jason Logan's NFL Wild Card Weekend Underdog predictions are backing the Bears and Steelers.",
    "fullText": "The NFL Playoffs have been ripe with underdog winners in recent years. Over the last five postseasons, playoff pups cover the spread at a 60% clip.\n\nThe Wild Card Round used to be one of the best slates to take the points. However, the “Super” Wild Card Weekend – with six games on the board instead of four - has been “Super Mild” in terms of underdog success.\n\nIn the seven playoffs before stretching the field to 14 teams, Wild Card dogs were 19-8-1 ATS – a 70% ATS windfall. Since expanding the bracket, pups have barely barked at 16-14 ATS over the last five postseasons.\n\nWith the field a little “watered down,” you can’t just blindly bag up all the underdogs and hope for the best. You must be more selective when it comes to taking the points with your NFL Wild Card picks and predictions.\n\nHere are my best underdog NFL picks for this year’s “Super” Wild Card Weekend.\n\nRegular season: 31-21-2 ATS (+6.73 units)\n\nBest bet: Chicago Bears +1.5\n(-120 at Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Chicago Bears backed into the postseason on a two-game slide but were playing their best football down the stretch. The offense, more specifically, has looked great.\n\nThis is a Top-5 attack in terms of EPA per play since Week 12, with a two-headed monster forming at running back (D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai) and really giving Ben Johnson’s playbook dimension.\n\nChicago grinded for 99 yards or more on the ground in the six games before Week 18’s flop against the Lions, topping 130 rushing yards in four of those games, including 138 and 150 yards in two matchups with the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe Packers’ once-mighty defense has been decimated by injuries, most notably along the defensive line. Green Bay has been bullied in the trenches, watching foes roll for a 48% success rate per handoff since Week 12 (31st). It’ll get pushed around by Chicago’s elite offensive line, which could be the best in the NFC.\n\nWinning the \"turf war\" makes life easier for everyone in Chitown.\n\nThose ground gains set up for shorter third downs, activate Johnson’s vaunted play-action schemes, make the Packers’ soft secondary vulnerable to random deep shots, and chew up possession, which then boosts the Bears defense and forces Green Bay to be one-dimensional with limited offensive touches.\n\nBest bet: Pittsburgh Steelers +3.5\n(-110 at BetRivers)\n\nRegardless of how they got there, the Pittsburgh Steelers are in the playoffs.\n\nThe Steelers are hosting a Houston Texans team in one of the toughest venues in all of sports. Acrisure Stadium will undoubtedly be loud and cold, with temperatures that “feel like” sub-freezing on Monday night.\n\nThe Texans are all about that defense, entering the postseason with the top-ranked stop unit in the land. But to cover the spread, you need to put some points on the board. That’s been challenging for C.J. Stroud & Co. – at least when venturing into the great outdoors.\n\nHouston averages less than 22 points per game in open-air venues and only 19.8 per road game – a 7.5-point slide compared to its production at home. Stroud is notoriously an “indoor cat,\" with his career passer rating, completion percentage, and yards per attempt all taking a nosedive outside.\n\nThe Texans’ offensive line is still an area of concern. While Houston has better protected Stroud this season, this group is still 21st in pass block win rate at ESPN, 22nd in pass block rating at PFF, and has allowed Stroud to feel pressure on almost 22% of dropbacks with the 12th most QB hurries allowed.\n\nPittsburgh’s bread and butter has always been chaos. That comes in the form of a pass rush that brings the blitz at the fourth-highest rate and sits Top 10 in both QB hits and sacks.\n\nStroud’s passing performances take a knock versus blitz-heavy schemes, with less time for deeper plays to develop. Houston went just 4-4 ATS as a visitor and, of course, you can't discount Mike Tomlin as a home underdog: 23-9-3 ATS since 2007 (70%).\n\nMy NFL Underdogs column is 31-21-2 ATS this season for +6.73 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

Patriots’ Stefon Diggs Makes Reference to Bad Macaroni and Cheese After Being Accused of Strangling His Chef \"Not once has that woman said anything to me about being touched.. NOT ONCE!!,\" the rapper wrote. \"Mind you, we was talking every single day until she left that house and she JUST wrote me this.. but I’m gonna let the courts handle s*** and when it gets handled I want all yall talkin s*** on your f***in knees with apologies just as loud the way yall been harassing over a lie… and I put that on my two month old son in the name of the lord!! That’s how confident I am.\" News broke on Tuesday, December 30, that Diggs was charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery over the alleged incident with the chef, which she claimed happened at his home on December 2. The police report referenced Diggs’ \"girlfriend,\" leading some to speculate it was referring to Cardi. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 12: Stefon Diggs and Cardi B celebrate after Game Four of the Eastern Conference Second Round NBA Playoffs between the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on May 12, 2025 in New York City. Elsa/Getty Images After the chef contacted police she said she “received a voice mail and text messages from a female that she believed to be Diggs girlfriend.” “The messages stated something to the effect of ‘you don’t need to do all this. It’s not that big of a deal,’” the report said. Cardi and Diggs have been linked since late 2024. The couple welcomed their first baby, a son, in November. Us Weekly has reached out to Cardi’s lawyer for comment. Diggs’ attorney, David Meier, said his client “categorically denies” the allegations in a statement to Us on December 30. Patriots Star Stefon Diggs’ Alleged Text Messages Revealed With Woman Accusing Him of Strangulation “They are unsubstantiated, uncorroborated and were never investigated — because they did not occur,” the statement said. “The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear: They are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee’s satisfaction. Stefon looks forward to establishing the truth in a court of law.” Diggs returned to the field on Sunday, January 4, as the Patriots hosted the Miami Dolphins in their regular season finale. The franchise has pledged their support to Diggs in the aftermath of the charges. “Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon,” the team said in a statement on December 30. “We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.” The Patriots host the Los Angeles Chargers in the NFL Wild Card Round on Sunday, January 11.",

    "fullText": "Longest tenured NFL head coaches: Mike Tomlin, Andy Reid lead list after John Harbaugh's Ravens firing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nVery few NFL head coaches last longer than a few years with one team, and even then, most don’t get to finish on their own terms.\n\nA handful of current head coaches have bucked that trend and made themselves fixtures with one team, even if no coaching stint is ever permanent.\n\nHere’s a look at the NFL’s longest-tenured head coaches after John Harbaugh’s firing as Baltimore Ravens coach.\n\nMORE:Why the Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 years\n\nHere are the eight longest tenured active NFL head coaches:\n\nMike Tomlin is the NFL’s longest-tenured coach and has been since Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots parted ways after the 2023 season. Hired to replace a retiring Bill Cowher in early 2007, Tomlin has never had a losing season in 19 years as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers and has guided the team to two Super Bowl appearances, including a win in his second season. If Tomlin decides to stick around for 2026, he will reach two decades with the Steelers.\n\nIt's hard to believe the NFL's second longest tenured coach could have another head coaching stint that matches his current one, but Andy Reid is heading into his 14th season with the Kansas City Chiefs after 14 years with the Philadelphia Eagles. Hired to bring some stability after a tumultuous 2012 season, Reid has beaten all expectations with the Chiefs, guiding the team to three Super Bowl wins and five AFC championships with Patrick Mahomes at quarterback after a strong first five years on the job.\n\nNo Buffalo Bills coach since Marv Levy had lasted more than four seasons until Sean McDermott came along. McDermott replaced Rex Ryan in 2017 and immediately guided the Bills to their first playoff appearance in 18 years, a preview of some of the success to come with Josh Allen at quarterback. While getting to the Super Bowl is still just a goal for McDermott, he has been one of the NFL's winningest coaches since he was hired in Buffalo.\n\nMORE:Ranking the 6 best candidates to replace John Harbaugh\n\nIf you could start an NFL team today, there likely aren’t many — or any — coaches you would take over Sean McVay. A little-known 30-year-old wunderkind when the Los Angeles Rams hired him to replace Jeff Fisher in 2017, McVay led an instant turnaround of a downtrodden franchise and took the Rams to the Super Bowl in his second season. He reached the pinnacle with a Super Bowl win in his fifth season, and his tenure in L.A. seems more likely to end on his terms than the team’s when all is said and done.\n\nAfter a bumpy first two seasons in San Francisco, Kyle Shanahan established himself as one of the NFL's premier coaches and has taken the 49ers to the Super Bowl twice in nine seasons on the job. Shanahan has navigated near-constant injuries and turned Brock Purdy into a franchise quarterback, making a Super Bowl ring just about all that eludes the franchise during his tenure.\n\nMORE: Ranking all 14 teams' chances at winning Super Bowl 60\n\nHere are the five longest head coaching stints in NFL history, headlined by a pair of legends.\n\nIf Tomlin continues on as head coach of the Steelers in 2026, he will still need to coach the team through the 2030 season to match Belichick's 24-year run with the Patriots and through the 2035 season to tie the all-time mark of 29 years.\n\nJohn Harbaugh's four best landing spots\n\nRevisiting last Ravens coach before John Harbaugh\n\nHow Ravens firing John Harbaugh impacts Lamar Jackson's future",

    "fullText": "Which team suits Jeremiyah Love in this years upcoming NFL draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the 2026 NFL Draft approaches, one name rising quickly on scouts’ boards is Notre Dame’s dynamic running back, Jeremiyah Love. Considered a top prospect and projected as a potential first-round pick, Love is generating significant buzz due to his rare combination of size, speed, and versatility. Mock drafts frequently link him to teams like the New Orleans Saints, Kansas City Chiefs, and Minnesota Vikings, with other franchises such as the New York Giants, Jets, and Arizona Cardinals also reportedly interested.\n\nStanding out at 6-foot-1 and around 220 pounds, Love combines downhill power running with breakaway speed, making him a threat between the tackles and in the open field. His 2025 season was remarkable; he set Notre Dame’s single-season touchdown record, proving his ability to find the end zone with consistency.\n\nBut Love isn’t just a runner. He’s a polished receiver out of the backfield, frequently lining up as a wide option and showing great hands and route-running ability. This dual-threat skill set is essential in today’s NFL, where running backs must impact the passing game as much as the ground game. Love’s willingness and ability as a pass protector further increase his value, showing he can handle the complexities of NFL blocking schemes.\n\nOne of the teams most commonly associated with Love in mock drafts is the New Orleans Saints. The Saints have a strong quarterback in place and a talented receiving corps, including Chris Olave, but lack a true star running back. Love would bring a new dimension to their offense with his downhill running style and receiving skills. The Saints also need to bolster their offensive line, but Love’s versatility would allow them to maximize their existing weapons.\n\nSimilarly, the Kansas City Chiefs could be an ideal landing spot. Pairing Love with Patrick Mahomes would provide a dynamic, multi-dimensional offensive threat capable of creating mismatches against defenses. The Minnesota Vikings, looking to rejuvenate their backfield, also make sense given Love’s potential to be a long-term solution in their offense.\n\nThe debate about drafting running backs in the first round remains lively. While some analysts are cautious due to the importance of offensive line play, recent first-round backs like Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs have proven how impactful the position can be with the right supporting cast. Saquon Barkley, another top-10 running back pick, demonstrated his full potential only after moving to Philadelphia, highlighting how situational fit is crucial.\n\nLove fits the mold of a first-round back who can immediately influence a team’s offensive identity. His combination of power, speed, and receiving ability offers a unique weapon that can change the way defenses prepare.\n\nUltimately, Jeremiyah Love is more than just a running back; he is a multi-faceted offensive weapon ready to make an immediate impact in the NFL. While some teams may hesitate to use a first-round pick on a running back due to positional value debates, Love’s talent and fit with teams in need could see him selected in the top 15 or even top 10.\n\nIf the Saints or Chiefs decide to prioritize offense in the early rounds, Love’s name will be among the first called a player who can bring explosiveness and versatility to an NFL offense hungry for game-changers. His draft stock continues to rise, and many believe he could redefine the value of the running back position in 2026.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "fullText": "With six head-coaching openings in the NFL, and possibly more, Bill Belichick's name will be mentioned publicly for one or more of the jobs. Whether he's privately considered for any of them remains to be seen.\n\nAppearing on the Let’s Go! podcast, Belichick was asked by host Jim Gray whether Belichick is interested in returning to the NFL.\n\n“Nothing's changed,\" Belichick said. \"I’m where I was a month ago. I'm here at North Carolina. I really appreciate the love and support that we've gotten from the community down here, from the school, from Chancellor Roberts, the ADs, Bubba Cunningham, Steve Newmark, working with Mike Lombardi and our staff here. We're building a good program and I'm excited about the direction we're headed in.”\n\nIt wasn't a \"no.\" But it's not relevant until someone wants to talk to him.\n\nSince being fired two years ago, he has had one interview, with the Falcons. The Falcons are looking again, with a clean slate (for now) in the front office.\n\nWould owner Arthur Blank want to give Belichick another look, periodic trolling by Jordon Hudson notwithstanding? While it's unclear where his coaching skills currently reside (e.g., would Belichick put a defensive coach in charge of the offense?), we're confident that Belichick wouldn't have given $100 million guaranteed to Kirk Cousins before using a top-10 pick on Michael Penix Jr. if he'd been the Atlanta coach in 2024.\n\nBelichick is currently on the board for five existing vacancies: +4000 for the Giants, +8000 for the Titans, +4000 for the Browns, +1200 for the Falcons, and +1600 for the Raiders. (DraftKings doesn't have odds for the Cardinals' job, for some reason.)\n\nA team will first need to be interested in Belichick. And he'd need to be interested in the team. (Belichick expressed to Gray disdain for teams that use search firms, which could make the search firm running the Falcons' search less inclined to seek him out.)\n\nLast year, when it became clear to Belichick that he wouldn't get a job in the 2025 cycle, he went to North Carolina. Lombardi thereafter questioned whether there are any good jobs in the NFL, while also explaining that he and Belichick prefer working in college football.\n\nMost of the jobs that come open are open for a reason. Still, if Belichick wants to catch Don Shula for the all-time wins record, no number of victories at UNC will matter.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's offensive line will look very different in 2026, as head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing will need to replace four starters, now including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three successful seasons in College Station.\n\nA New Jersey native, Bisontis chose the Aggies over Rutgers in the 2023 recruiting class, bringing elite size and versatility at 6'5\" and 315 pounds, and during his first season with the Aggies, Bisontis started at right tackle amid former head coach Jimbo Fisher's final season at the helm.\n\nAfter Fisher was dismissed, Mike Elko felt that Adam Cushing was the perfect choice to help Bisontis reach his full potential, slotting him at left guard, where he has dominated ever since. Logging 1,962 snaps in his Texas A&M career, including 795 snaps, all at left guard during the 2025 season. Bisontis's elite strength will quickly translate to the next level, knowing that NFL scouts see him as a \"plug-and-play\" option at left or right guard.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Bisontis as an above-average pass protector (70.7) and average run blocker (62.7). Still, these grades, compared to most SEC starting guards, prove the level of defensive competition within the conference.\n\nOver the last three days, Texas A&M landed commitments from LSU transfer guard Coen Echols and South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, which now makes even more sense given today's news. Needing size and SEC experience at left and right guard is key to avoiding a substantial drop-off in the trenches, and credit to Mike Elko for preparing for the inevitable.\n\nTexas A&M OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft, per his Instagram (chase_bisontis) 👍 #GigEm @CBisontis pic.twitter.com/iQfPNJsSQI\n\n— Luke Evangelist (@lukeevangelist_) January 6, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M star OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft",

    "fullText": "The Athletic has live coverage of Bears vs. 49ers on NFL “Sunday Night Football.”\n\nGood morning! Keep your job today. Inside:\n\nEvery moment of the past two years has felt like an inflection point for women’s basketball in America. Viewership is surging. Will they capitalize?\n\nIt kind of defeats the entire definition of an inflection point, but if there really is one, the sport has arrived at its doorstep now. Consider:\n\nThe WNBA, after a spike in popularity, is undergoing a contentious negotiation for a new collective bargaining agreement. Salaries and revenue are set to explode. The question is just how the players and league will agree to share the boom.\n\nThe sport’s rise has manifested in other ways. As recently as a couple years ago, it was standard for WNBA players — afforded meager salaries compared to those in other pro sports — to travel overseas to make big money during the offseason.\n\nEnter new leagues like Unrivaled, which opened its second season last night, and Project B, a new venture that will launch in November. While there are differences — Unrivaled is a three-on-three sport, while Project B is more akin to the full game but with a wide travel schedule — they offer similar things: more money, and player equity in the league.\n\nUnrivaled started its sophomore year with four games last night, highlighted by the Mist, an expansion franchise, winning its first game, and Rose, the defending champions, winning by 20. My favorite bit about watching these games: The league uses a modified version of the Elam Ending, in which teams play three timed quarters, but the fourth quarter is untimed. The first team to reach a certain point total (11 points more than the leading team has after three quarters) wins.\n\nI asked Ben Pickman, who wrote an excellent preview of the Unrivaled year yesterday, about whether he thinks the league has a chance to make an imprint on the larger sports world this year:\n\n“Unrivaled already excels at creating social media content that puts WNBA players fully onto viewer radars during the winter. What will be interesting is how its viewership continues to grow and whether fans become more invested in the nightly results of its games. The league’s viewership on TNT and truTV in Year 1 was comparable to the NWSL’s viewership on ESPN networks this past season, and though it is far behind the WNBA’s viewership, the two leagues are of course at varying points in their history.”\n\nBen also made an interesting point to me: With the NBA off TNT, Paige Bueckers, who plays for the Breeze, is the second-most famous athlete broadcast by TNT Sports, behind only Shohei Ohtani.\n\nThese are exciting things. Let’s move on to something a little more dour:\n\nWe discussed the looming specter of “Black Monday” yesterday — the day most NFL coaches get fired. That part came to fruition. What we didn’t expect was the firings to extend beyond the American version of football.\n\nCleveland canned Kevin Stefanski after six years in charge, which saw two playoff appearances, a disastrous trade for Deshaun Watson and a sack record all achieved amid boggling highs and lows. Jason Lloyd writes that, despite those temporary highs, Stefanski leaves behind a lot of bad things.\n\nThe Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon after three largely unsuccessful seasons. He finishes his tenure 15-36 with no playoff appearances. Tough timing after the team’s X account wished him a happy birthday Sunday.\n\nPete Carroll is officially one-and-done in Las Vegas, which feels like a sad line in what probably will be a Hall of Fame career (a convo for another day). General manager John Spytek, hired last offseason with Carroll, will remain in his role and help Tom Brady with the coaching search. What a weird year.\n\nWe’ll have to wait on movement for replacements, as plenty of those candidates are still coaching for playoff teams. One curious name to consider, though: Philip Rivers.\n\nNow, to the surprising news from across the ocean we briefly mentioned yesterday:\n\nManchester United is done with manager Ruben Amorim after a maddening 14-month tenure that began with lofty promise. Amorim’s critics viewed him as inflexible, though his tactics were successful elsewhere. Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League table last season and sits sixth right now. One thing will be missed: Amorim’s bizarre news conferences.\n\nIn other soccer sacking news, Celtic parted with Wilfried Nancy after just 33 days in charge. He joined Dec. 3 after a stint with the Columbus Crew. His early dismissal set records.\n\nWoof. Let’s move on to some more … normal news.\n\nHawks, Young working on trade\n\nAtlanta and star guard Trae Young are discussing a possible trade, a source confirmed to The Athletic, which has been a long time coming on a few different levels. Young is still just 27 and in his prime, and still possesses the ability to be an elite scorer. But it’s very clear the Hawks are a better team without him this year, and he can enter free agency after the season. Read our full story here, which includes a potential suitor.\n\nMontana State wins wild FCS title game\n\nMontana State won its first FCS championship since 1984 last night, 35-34 over Illinois State, which had become the Cinderella of the FCS tournament bracket. The game itself was unhinged, and ended after the Bobcats converted a fourth-and-10 for a touchdown in overtime on a pass from quarterback Justin Lamson to Taco Dowler (sweet name). That was merely the caboose for what transpired in the minutes before. The full recap is worth a read.\n\nSweden outlasted Czechia to win its first World Juniors gold medal since 2012 yesterday. More details inside.\n\nIndiana and Alabama drew a record 23.9 million viewers for their Rose Bowl matchup. Yowza.\n\nDolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is open to a fresh start with a new team. Hm.\n\nColts cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. said yesterday he is considering retirement after suffering three concussions this season. Read the 29-year-old’s full comments.\n\nTough flip: Notre Dame quarterback Kenny Minchey is heading to Kentucky, just hours after he committed to Nebraska.\n\nF1 driver Checo Pérez said being Max Verstappen’s teammate at Red Bull was the “worst job.” Yikes.\n\n📺 NCAAM: Duke at Louisville\n\n7 p.m. ET on ESPN\n\nThe Blue Devils are ranked No. 6 and have the star power, while the Cardinals are No. 20 and still favored in this game. Sounds like a good sell to me.\n\n📺 NHL: Panthers at Maple Leafs\n\n7:30 p.m. ET on TNT and HBO Max\n\nThe defending champions have steadied a bit after a tough start to the season, while Toronto remains moribund, which has been a slow-burn surprise. \n\n📺 NBA: Heat at Timberwolves\n\n8 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock\n\nThe best NBA game of the evening is here, and it’s funny that the 23-13 Timberwolves are flying under the proverbial radar a bit. Still great with a Tier 1 scorer, but sitting sixth in the West and biding time until the playoffs. Don’t sleep on them, though.\n\nGet tickets to games like these here.\n\nWe had a scheduling mix-up last week, for which we apologize. Here is the excellent story we promised you then: Katie Whyatt’s look at how sex workers have increasingly used European soccer clubs as sort of a brand boost on social media. Read it here.\n\nNick Baumgardner has a new 2026 NFL mock draft with Oregon QB Dante Moore going No. 1 to Las Vegas. Moore might be deciding between being the No. 1 pick and staying in college.\n\nDan Duggan tore into Giants ownership yesterday for retaining general manager Joe Schoen, arguing the franchise has “no standards anymore.” Make time for this one.\n\nImportant table-setter: Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon update us on where the Cubs, Yankees and Blue Jays stand as the MLB offseason withers away.\n\nMost-clicked in the newsletter yesterday: NFL playoff schedule.\n\nMost-read on the website yesterday: Our projections of every NFL playoff team’s odds to win the Super Bowl.\n\n📫 That’s all for now!

The Seahawks and Broncos have the byes in each conference to the divisional round, with their defense propelling them to the top of the standings.\n\nBelow are Sporting News' predictions for the 2026 NFL playoffs, complete with updated Super Bowl 60 picks. Our NFL experts break down the brackets and project which players will break out, which contenders will break down, and which teams will break through during the postseason.\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills. Kansas City isn't in the way this year. Josh Allen is 7-2 against everybody else in the playoffs – but the only thing holding us back is that Buffalo will have to prove it on the road. Allen is 0-4 on the road in the postseason and the path starts at Jacksonville. The Jaguars have allowed more than 20 points one time through a seven-game win streak.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: The Houston Texans. The Texans are the hottest team in the NFL with a stifling defense and an offense that has found a rhythm. Quietly, Houston has won a playoff game in back-to-back seasons, giving them experience at the biggest stage that the top of this year's AFC field doesn't possess. If CJ Stroud plays to an efficient level, this team has the formula to win anywhere in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Los Angeles Rams. This might be rather obvious but they have a rejuvenated MVP-caliber Matthew Stafford at QB with Sean McVay as their coach, the combination that helped them win Super Bowl 56 with similar support from the receiving corps, defense and running game. They were also smart to drive for the No. 5 seed so they get the easiest road game early, before a potential toss-up rematch with the Seahawks\n\nDaniel Mader: The Buffalo Bills. The AFC bracket is loaded with up-and-coming, yet unproven quarterbacks — this is the best chance Josh Allen has ever had to reach the Super Bowl, even as a No. 6 seed. Buffalo’s five-loss record doesn’t concern me much, nor does the lack of a true WR1 or a defense that has struggled at times. With Allen, the Bills are capable of beating any team in the AFC.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Los Angeles Rams remain one of the most well-rounded teams in the NFL. A strong run game and the efforts of Davante Adams and Puka Nacua as wide receivers carry the offense. Adams missed the end of the regular season so that he could help up for the playoffs, and he is expected to be back. Los Angeles goes on the road to take on the Carolina Panthers in the first round, where the Rams lost 31-28 in Week 13. Still, the Rams are set up for an easy first-round matchup and should go on a deep run as long as they don't completely look past the Panthers in the first round.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Los AngelesRams. Special mention for the 49ers, Texans, Patriots, Jaguars, Bills and Eagles, all of whom could easily contend for a Super Bowl crown. But Los Angeles is a well-rounded unit that has gamers on both sides of the ball. The Rams are the NFL's most explosive offense and have enjoyed a fair few shutdown showings on defense.\n\nEd Williams: Los Angeles Rams. This team checks all of the boxes of a true Super Bowl threat. First and foremost, the Rams defeated the Bengals in Super Bowl 56 just a few years ago. While some key names like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald are missing from that squad, younger playmakers like Puka Nacua and Jared Verse have risen to prominence since then. Matthew Stafford is an MVP favorite, and Davante Adams as emerged as a favorite red zone target. And Sean McVay is widely considered one of the best coaches in the league. The defense can give up yards and points, but they're also dynamic and capable of forcing turnovers at any time. As far as wild-card teams go, no one is looking forward to the Rams coming to town.\n\nBill Bender: Philadelphia Eagles. The Jaguars are an underdog and the Bears line against the Packers will be short either way. Those are not upsets. The 49ers – despite all the injuries – still have a defense that ranked 11th against the run. Brock Purdy had a 111 passer rating on the road. Philadelphia finished 5-3 at home this season – and that included a 1-2 record against playoff teams. Will the Super Bowl champions be an early exit?\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Philadelphia Eagles. The defending champions have had a rocky season, winning the NFC East on the backs of a strong defense. But the offensive issues have persisted throughout the season and remain a problem entering the playoffs. While the defense is one of the best, the Eagles will have to find a way to score consistently in order to make it back to the Super Bowl. With a tough 49ers team on tap first, the Eagles offensive concerns could send them home quickly.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Chicago Bears. They've been living on the edge with some low-scoring games and fourth-quarter comebacks. It's been a massive breakthrough season all around with Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson, but they can be in trouble right away vs. the Packers if they don't get the turnovers to bounce in their favor.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Chicago Bears. Ben Johnson has clearly elevated this franchise in every way it hoped he would, and this has been a terrific Bears season that offers plenty of hope for the future. But I do think some one-score luck played a big role in Chicago’s 11-6 record, and I question how sustainable it is. Anything can happen in divisional games. I buy the Packers’ playoff experience over the Bears.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: No disrespect to the Jacksonville Jaguars; they have had an incredible bounce-back season. Looking at the first-round matchups for the top teams, though, Jacksonville will have to host Buffalo. The Bills went 12-5 this season and that was playing well below their potential. Yes, Buffalo has to hit the road, but if it all comes together for them as it can and Josh Allen looks like the player who won the MVP Award last season, it could easily be an early postseason exit for the Jaguars.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Denver Broncos. Denver enjoyed a wondrous campaign under Sean Payton and its defense is arguably the NFL's best, surrendering the third-fewest points in the league. But there's reason to believe the Broncos' luck could be running out. They were 11-2 in one-score games this season, a record that, while impressive, could be hard to maintain against the AFC's best sides. Bo Nix still leaves something to be desired and the Broncos' toils against teams like the Jets, Giants, Raiders and Commanders suggests they're not quite the juggernaut their record would initially indicate.\n\nEd Williams: Jacksonville Jaguars. The turnaround Liam Coen has pulled off in Jacksonville is impressive, and he probably should be getting more attention for Coach of the Year. But unfortunately for them, they draw Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills. Some of the game's biggest names at QB will be missing from the postseason this year like Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson, but the reigning MVP is back as a 12-5 No. 6 seed. While his receiving weapons won't instill fear into opposing defenses themselves, Allen's ability to take over a game at any moment certainly can cause sleepless nights. And on top of that, James Cook was the league's leading rusher and gives them another threat to break off chunk plays. Trevor Lawrence will have to keep his hot streak going to keep pace with Allen, and the much-improved Jags defense will need to prove this isn't the same old Jags. It's not an impossible task, but the Jags likely would have preferred to see the Chargers or Texans.\n\nBill Bender: Bills QB Josh Allen. Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye are acceptable answers – and the potential for a third matchup between the Bills and Patriots could be in the cards. Allen has everything but a Super Bowl appearance on his resume at this point. It's time to change that.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Will Anderson: Ten years ago, Von Miller capped his incredible playoff run with a Super Bowl in San Francisco, providing a blueprint for Will Anderson. If it weren't for Myles Garrett's record-breaking season, Anderson would be among the favorites to win Defensive Player of the Year, as his career-high 12 sacks sparked the Texans defense to the top of the NFL. With a few of the top quarterbacks sitting at home, it will be a defensive player shining the brightest in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence. There's every reason to believe he will keep this hot streak groove in full command of Liam Coen's balanced and explosive offense into the playoffs. The Bills' defense has plenty of holes to exploit in the wild-card round and he's already proved he can rip Denver's defense. He will keep breaking out on delay as the No. 1 pick talent he was supposed to be, five years after he was drafted.\n\nDaniel Mader: The man who can still be considered the reigning league MVP, Josh Allen. Buffalo’s star quarterback seemed to get better as the regular season went on, and I think he’ll continue that trend into the postseason without any Patrick Mahomes-shaped ghosts to worry about. Allen can be considered the most dynamic individual talent in the 2026 playoffs.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: Drake Maye and head coach Mike Vrabel seem like the perfect marriage, poised to be a threat in the AFC for years to come. Just when the league got past the dominance of New England, this duo is bringing it back. Maye can run Vrabel's offense, and the defensive-minded head coach can focus on what he knows best. Maye might miss out on the regular-season MVP Award, but he has a great chance to win playoff MVP because he likely won't be benched in the third quarter because of huge leads.\n\nDavid Suggs:Puka Nacua. If the Rams are to win the Super Bowl, their third-year pass-catcher will be among the biggest reasons why. Nacua is as steady as they come, finding success against both man and zone coverages. I reckon he'll keep the good times rolling during the playoffs.\n\nEd Williams: Jalen Hurts. The Eagles offense has not exactly been a thing of beauty during the regular season, but Jalen Hurts has a habit of playing his best football when the lights are brightest. Passing game struggles were a common issue in 2024 as well, but when the playoffs came around, the Eagles seemed to flip a switch and were airing it out seemingly at will. Last year they also had a historic season from Saquon Barkley in the running game. That has not been the case in 2025, as the offensive line has struggled mightily. If the Eagles offense is going to flip a switch again, it's likely going to have to be Jalen Hurts. The weapons are there with A.J. Brown, DeVonte Smith and Barkley, plus tight end Dallas Goedert has evolved into a deadly red zone target. The Eagles offense is at its best when Jalen Hurts is also hurting defenses with his legs, and now that they're in the postseason and it's win or go home, look for him to run more often than he did during the regular season. The playcalling and sequencing from rookie offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo hasn't done Hurts any favors this season, but the reigning Super Bowl MVP can block out all the noise and silence his doubters once and for all if he can lead Philly back to the promised land.\n\nBill Bender: Rams defensive end Jared Verse. Verse had five pressures or \n\nDaniel Chavkin: RJ Harvey. Fantasy players know how talented RJ Harvey is, but it's time for the rookie to break out in the biggest moment. The Broncos offense will need Harvey to provide a spark in the running game and give Bo Nix a reliable back, allowing them to make a run to the Super Bowl. Harvey didn't surpass 75 yards in any game during his rookie season, but expect that to change once Denver takes the field in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Patriots edge rusher Harold Landry. The former Titan has been more impactful down the stretch rushing the passer for Mike Vrabel and he can be a more disruptive defensive force the team needs against better QBs in the playoffs.\n\nDaniel Mader: I’ll throw out a pair of Jaguars offensive weapons here: wide receiver Parker Washington and tight end Brenton Strange. While Jacksonville gets a tough first-round matchup against Buffalo, I’ve found it impressive how Trevor Lawrence has continued to thrive despite Brian Thomas Jr. not being the same talent as 2024 and Travis Hunter’s season ending early. Washington and Strange can make a bigger name for themselves if they help the Jags take down the Bills.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV led Seattle with 126 total tackles on the year. He is a beast in coverage and it is hard for any runner to get past him when he goes to tackle them. Jones has had a phenomenal year when dropping into pass coverage too. He has seven passes defended and leads Seattle with an impressive five interceptions, the second-most by any player in the NFL this year. You've likely heard of rookie safety Nick Emmanwori for Seattle, but be ready to get to know Jones.\n\nDavid Suggs:Woody Marks. The Texans' rookie numbers don't necessarily pop off the page at first glance. But he established himself as Houston's No. 1 tailback as the season wore on, tallying 15 or more carries in five of his last seven games. Marks is a gifted pass-catcher in space whose elusiveness figures to cause problems for opposition defenses. He should prove to be one of C.J. Stroud's favorite safety blankets.\n\nEd Williams: Eagles linebacker Jalyx Hunt spent three years at Cornell playing safety before transferring to Houston Christian University, where he transitioned to a linebacker/EDGE player. The Eagles drafted him in the third round at pick 94, which seemed like it might have been a reach at the time. But Hunt's development in Vic Fangio's system has been something to behold. He flashed some serious potential in his limited opportunities as a rookie, but after the Eagles let Josh Sweat walk in free agency and with Brandon Graham's retirement and Nolan Smith's triceps injury to start the season, Hunt was thrust into a starting role. Hunt was thrown right into the deep end, and he's really excelled in the expanded role. He leads the team in pressures (55), QB hits (24), sacks (6.5) and interceptions (3). In fact, he leads all EDGE rushers in the NFL with three picks. His 21.2% pressure rate on third down is 8th among NFL EDGE rushers this year. He's the only player in the history of the Eagles franchise to lead the team in both INTs and sacks. The Eagles can bring pressure in many ways, but Hunt just seems to get better and better the more he plays, and the scary thing is, he's still relatively new to the position.\n\nBill Bender: Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford is playing at a MVP level, and they are good enough to make a run through the NFC. Sean McVay knows how to move the pieces with Kyren Williams and Puka Nacua. Davante Adams should return for the playoff run. The Seahawks were the only team in the NFC that limited Los Angeles to 21 points or less this season.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Jacksonville Jaguars. Since Week 7, the Jaguars have scored at least 23 points in all 11 games, including seven games with at least 30 points. Head coach Liam Coen has Trevor Lawrence playing at a high level, which included dropping 34 points on the Denver Broncos in Week 16. Many of this year's playoff teams are defense-first teams, but it was Jacksonville's scorching-hot offense that led the Jaguars back to the playoffs.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay get it done with so many skill players behind a strong offensive line. They can dominate with wide receivers or burn you with tight ends. They can also now field a 1-2 punch in the power running game. The Rams have a consistent floor and a high ceiling.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford had a career year, which says a lot at age 37. I think the Rams go as far as their young defense takes them, meaning I expect Stafford’s arm to continue thriving in the playoffs. I’m not confident the Seahawks, Eagles or any other team can slow down Puka Nacua and Davante Adams for 60 minutes.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Los Angeles Rams are getting healthy and that is going to be a problem for defenses. Even when Los Angeles didn't have Davante Adams through the end of the season, tight end Tyler Higbee was activated off of IR and had 91 yards and a touchdown. Add in Adams to Kyren Williams, Puka Nacua, Tyler Higbee and Colby Parkinson and you've got one of the deeper offenses in the playoffs. Oh, and L.A. happened to score the most points per game (30.1) during the regular season.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Los Angeles Rams. They led the league in scoring and averaged 31.75 points across four matchups with the Seahawks and 49ers. Matthew Stafford was a revelation this year, while Los Angeles boasts perhaps the best pass-catching tandem in the sport in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams. I think the points will keep on flowing in Tinseltown.\n\nEd Williams: Los Angeles Rams. Sean McVay can get conservative at times, but when push comes to shove, give me Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua, Davante Adams, the Kyren Williams/Blake Corum duo at running back and the playcalling and offensive scheming of the head coach over any other team in the postseason. Josh Allen may be the most dynamic quarterback in the playoffs, but the Rams are the most complete offense. You can get pressure on Matthew Stafford, but he's also capable of getting the ball out quickly and he can throw at weird angles to get around defenders in pursuit. If the defense isn't finishing and bringing him down, the Rams could go all the way.\n\nBill Bender: Houston Texans. Houston hasn't given up more than 21 points in a game since Week 10 – and they allowed an average of 15.4 points per game on the road this season. The Texans allowed 30 points in Week 18 – but we're not worried about that. The tandem of Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. can wreck a game plan – and that should bring more than enough confidence going into a matchup with the AFC North champions.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Seattle Seahawks. It's hard to hold the 49ers to three points in San Francisco, but that's exactly what the Seahawks did on Saturday. Under second-year head coach Mike MacDonald, Seattle's defense can match up against any offense, especially when they won't have to leave Seattle for the rest of the NFC playoffs. Combine incredible talent with a high-level defensive play-caller, and you get the most trustworthy defense in the league.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Seattle Seahawks. They have become super stingy against the pass with pressure and coverage clicking and they always have been tough to run against. In a season of big-time scoring, they held opponents to an average of 17.2 points per game.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Seattle Seahawks. Mike Macdonald looks like a home-run hire for Seattle, with a terrific blend of versatility, dominant pass rushing and overall disruptiveness on his defensive unit. The Seahawks are like an inverse Rams to me: I expect their defense to win games, but the bigger question is whether Sam Darnold is ready to take a leap toward playoff success.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Seattle Seahawks earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC partly due to having the league's leading wide receiver, but also boasting one of the best defenses in the NFL. This feels the closest the Seahawks have been to re-capturing the Legion of Boom dominance as the unit finds itself in the top-10 for several defensive metrics. Seattle's defense ranks 2nd in points against per game, fifth in first downs allowed, sixth in total yards allowed. The Seahawks have given up the 12th-fewest passing yards and third-fewest rushing yards per game.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Houston Texans. Houston's defense has it all; tough tacklers are littered across the front seven, while the secondary is awash with starlight. DeMeco Ryans' side conceded just 14 to the Rams, 15 to the 49ers, 17 to the Jaguars and 19 to the Bills. I'm expecting them to offer similar displays during postseason play.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. There have been a couple blips on the radar along the way, but the Eagles' defense has really carried the team in 2025. While the offense has gone through highly-publicized struggles this season, one of the youngest defenses in the league has outperformed expectations. Quinyon Mitchell followed up his impressive rookie campaign by being the only cornerback in the league to be targeted 60+ times and not allow a TD (82 targets). He also allowed the lowest completion percentage among all cornerbacks. Cooper DeJean is already one of, if not the best nickel cornerbacks in the league, and the linebacker tandem of Zach Baun and Nakobe Dean might be the best in the league. The defensive front is stacked with Jalen Carter finally looking healthier after shoulder issues, Jordan Davis enjoying a career year, Nolan Smith rounding into form, Jalyx Hunt continuing to ascend and free agent acquisition Jaelan Phillips paying immediate dividends. But the X-factor is Vic Fangio who always seems to have an answer at the most important times. This defense can give up yards and production, but while they may bend, they don't typically break and tighten things up in the red zone.\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills. Too much belief? Buffalo was 3-3 against teams that are in the postseason this year, but it's time for the breakthrough. James Cook will keep the running game going. Buffalo has just one turnover in its last four games. Can they go through Jacksonville, New England and Denver to get back to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1993?\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Houston Texans. The Texans have never made it to the AFC Championship game, but that ends this year on their trip to the Super Bowl. Houston has a defense that can travel on the road and win anywhere, which will help carry the Texans to cold-weather cities in the dead of winter. Plus, DeMeco Ryans is already one of the best young coaches in the NFL, and he will show why with a deep playoff run.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jacksonville Jaguars. Their profile has fewer weaknesses by the passing week. Trevor Lawrence fills the elite AFC QB void left by no Patrick Mahomes and they suddenly look loaded there, playing off Travis Etienne and the running game. Their defense is also opportunistic in forcing takeaways in crucial game-changing moments.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Buffalo Bills. Part of my reasoning is that I simply can’t yet trust the crop of Bo Nix, Drake Maye, Trevor Lawrence or Justin Herbert until one of those quarterbacks breaks through and proves they can lead a team to multiple playoff wins. Until then, I won’t bet against Josh Allen, the most proven and dynamic quarterback in the playoffs. Down the stretch of close games, he’s who I think can lead a team through the bracket.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The turnaround in one year has been impressive for the New England Patriots. The Patriots have a great quarterback and a pair of running backs that can help consistently get the offense down the field. As long as Stefon Diggs' off-the-field issues don't prevent him from playing in the playoffs, New England is in a prime position to get back to the Super Bowl, and will match up well no matter who the Patriots play in the postseason.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Jacksonville Jaguars. Call this one wishful thinking. But the Jaguars have been on a tear as of late, vanquishing eight straight sides to climb to the upper echelons of the AFC. Trevor Lawrence has looked every bit like the highly-touted talent he was suggested to be while in college. Jacksonville shone in wins over the Texans, 49ers, Chargers and Broncos. Liam Coen's bunch will keep the good times rolling in the playoffs.\n\nEd Williams: Buffalo Bills. Both the AFC and NFC are really wide open this year. The Bills are a 6-seed, so they'll likely have to be on the road the entire postseason, but Josh Allen is the best quarterback in the postseason. Drake Maye has put together an MVP-caliber campaign in just his second year, but they also have had a relatively easy schedule. This will be his first taste of the postseason, while Allen is no stranger to the perils of postseason play. If the Bills are able to get by Jacksonville in the first round, barring a Chargers upset of the Patriots, they'll get the Broncos in the divisional round. While the Broncos have a great defense, the two teams also met in the playoffs last year, and the Bills emerged with a convincing 31-7 victory. While it would likely be much closer this time around, I'll take Josh Allen over Bo Nix any day of the week.\n\nBill Bender: Los Angeles Rams. This is a tough pick because we believe they will have to go through the Seahawks to get there. Seattle is a real threat, and Sam Darnold has been on point all season. We think those teams will see each other in either the divisional round or the NFC championship game – and a rematch of the 38-37 thriller in Week 16 is in order. The Rams had 581 yards in that game.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Seattle Seahawks. Getting home-field advantage was crucial for the Seahawks, as there is no tougher place to play in January than Seattle. With the NFC full of fierce opponents, the bye will help the Seahawks get healthy and prepare while their opponents battle on wild-card weekend. As long as Sam Darnold can protect the football, which he has done for most of the season, Seattle should be favored to make it out of the NFC.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Seattle Seahawks. This is an odd feeling that they are back in a position to win a Super Bowl far removed from Russell Wilson and Pete Carroll days. Mike Macdonald has created a dominant defense that can win a championship with Sam Darnold just needing to protect the ball as a complementary QB.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. Playing in a loaded NFC West was tough for L.A. after a strong start to the season, but I still think this is the most talented offense in football with a young defense that has stepped up plenty of times before. If the Rams can avoid their previous special teams issues, their path to the Super Bowl is there: beat an 8-9 Panthers team, take down a familiar Seahawks squad in the divisional round, then overcome the Eagles, 49ers, Packers or Bears, all of whom have their flaws, in the NFC Championship Game.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: I think the Los Angeles Rams beat the Carolina Panthers, but then benefit from the San Francisco 49ers beating the Philadelphia Eagles. This would allow Los Angeles to face the Chicago Bears before either the Seattle Seahawks or the Niners in the NFC Championship game. I think the Rams have the deepest offense and the second-best defense in the NFC playoff picture which should help them to win the NFC.\n\nDavid Suggs:The Los Angeles Rams. Losses to the Seahawks and Falcons scuppered what looked to be a push for the NFC's No. 1 seed in Los Angeles. But Stafford has been the league's best hurler and has a championship pedigree. Sean McVay will have the Rams ready for the winter, just as they were in 2019 and 2022. Los Angeles fell just short of the NFC Championship last year. It will do one better in 2025, beating all comers to punch its ticket for the Super Bowl.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. While it hasn't been pretty at times, Philadelphia managed to avoid a true Super Bowl hangover and are not only back in the postseason, but broke the NFC East curse and won the division for the second straight year — the first time that feat has been accomplished since the Eagles won four straight division titles from 2001-2004. The defense has carried the team at times, but the talent on the offensive side of the ball cannot be discounted. Even though they've struggled with consistency, Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Adams, Saquon Barkley and company are capable of beating any defense if they are all on the same page. Jalen Hurts has proven he doesn't shrink in the spotlight, and that experience can help carry them through some tough matchups along the way. The two seeds above them in the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears do not boast much postseason experience, so it's not out of the question that Eagles can gain more home-field advantage along the way, and The Linc is a difficult place to play, especially in the colder months.\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills beat Los Angeles Rams. Two wild-card teams? It's a risky pick, but this is a wide-open playoff. Defense matters, and the Rams had some late-season concerns. It's not just about Josh Allen and Matthew Stafford, but in the playoffs, the QBs take center stage. Would Stafford win a second Super Bowl? Or will Buffalo finally win a Super Bowl? Allen finally gets it done.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Houston Texans over Seattle Seahawks. It's been a weird year in the NFL, so it's only fitting that the Super Bowl champion is an unexpected victor. DeMeco Ryan and the Texans are on a nine-game winning streak entering the playoffs, and thanks to a strong defense and timely offense, will ride the winning streak four more games to a Super Bowl title in a low-scoring battle against Seattle.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jacksonville Jaguars over Seattle Seahawks. In the ultimate season of surprise, let's go for a team that has never been to a Super Bowl to win a Super Bowl on its first try. Lawrence gives the Jaguars a QB equalizer or edge over most teams and the Jaguars match up well with the Seahawks as they excel at forcing takeaways and the Seahawks often have trouble with giveaways.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. There are plenty of reasons to doubt L.A., as there are for every team in the bracket this season, but between the Rams’ head coach, terrific quarterback play, talented wide receiver duo and group of defensive playmakers, I still think they have another gear to reach. Give me the Rams’ second Super Bowl win in five years.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: It hurts taking the New England Patriots to win another Super Bowl after we had to deal with their recent dynasty, but no matter the matchup they face this postseason, they should be favored or at the very least match up well. If they had a more prolific WR2 in the offense, it feels like New England would be everyone's favorite. I think the Patriots and Rams play each other in the Super Bowl, and New England is able to do just enough to win another ring.\n\nDavid Suggs:The Los Angeles Rams. I just think they've got a really balanced side that is capable of causing opposition sides problems in a number of ways. McVay, Stafford and Los Angeles beat the Jaguars to hoist their second Lombardi Trophy since returning to Hollywood.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles just outlasted the Bills a couple of weeks ago in Week 17 of the regular season, but that could have been just a preview of what we might see in the Super Bowl. While Levi's Stadium is not a dome, it's also not likely they'll have to deal with monsoon freezing rain conditions like the two squads just dealt with in Buffalo. The offenses should be able to put more points on the board, but it's the Eagles defense that will come up big in limiting Josh Allen, and Jalen Hurts will silence his critics once again with another Super Bowl MVP award.",

    "fullText": "After Travis Kelce exited the field solemnly on Sunday night in Las Vegas after the Kansas City Chiefs fell for the final time this NFL season, there was one question on every fan, pundit, and probably even player’s mind:\n\nWas that the last game Travis Kelce ever played?\n\nOn Monday, we have somewhat of an answer, albeit one many fans might not have wanted to hear.\n\nFollowing the team’s game, Kelce shuffled into the locker room and was faced with questions from the media about his future plans with the Chiefs and if he had already decided on his future.\n\nKelce admitted that after the Chiefs' Super Bowl loss last year, he instantly knew he would be back with the Chiefs the next season. He wasn’t going to let his career end that way, and he was motivated that night to return to play with the only franchise he’s ever known.\n\nAfter the Raiders' loss, however, he was much more split. He explained that he doesn’t know at the moment when he will decide what he will do for the rest of the year regarding football.\n\nOne of the most successful players on and off the field, Kelce is scheduled to marry his partner, world pop star Taylor Swift, this coming June in Rhode Island.\n\nHe also hosts one of the most popular podcasts in North America, “New Heights” with his brother, retired NFL lineman and fellow Super Bowl champion Jason Kelce.\n\nEven Travis’ mother, Donna, is set to make her big television debut in only a few days on “The Traitors,” a competitive reality show produced by NBC on Peacock.\n\nWe will keep you updated on Kelce’s decision on whether he will play his 14th season in the NFL or if Sunday was his last dance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Did Travis Kelce Retire From NFL, Chiefs After Week 18 Loss?",

    "description": "The alternative to paying a premium price for a high-end quarterback isn’t pretty.",
    "fullText": "The NFL playoff field is set, and it's missing half of the league's top 10 highest-paid quarterbacks in average annual value.\n\nSpotrac made note of that fact on Monday, a day after the dust settled on the NFL's regular season. Of the league's top 10 paid quarterbacks, Josh Allen, Trevor Lawrence, Jordan Love, Brock Purdy and Justin Herbert are all in the postseason.\n\nDak Prescott, Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Jared Goff and Lamar Jackson are not.\n\nHalf of the Top 10 Average Paid QBs made the playoffs - half didn't.\n\nDak Prescott ❌\nJosh Allen ✅\nJoe Burrow ❌\nTrevor Lawrence ✅\nJordan Love ✅\nTua Tagovailoa ❌\nJared Goff ❌\nBrock Purdy ✅\nJustin Herbert ✅\nLamar Jackson ❌\n\n— Spotrac (@spotrac) January 5, 2026\n\nWhich got us to thinking. Are teams hamstringing their playoff chances in a salary-capped league by paying premiums for quarterbacks? Is it too difficult in the modern NFL to build a competitive roster around a quarterback playing on a premium salary?\n\nQuarterback is the most important position in football, if not in all of sports. It's difficult to win a Super Bowl without a high-end signal caller, though Super Bowls have been won with Nick Foles, Jeff Hostetler, Jim Plunkett, Brad Johnson and Trent Dilfer.\n\nBut having a Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or Joe Montana is historically the best ingredient for success. And they cost money.\n\nHere's a look at the salaries of starting quarterbacks for all 32 NFL teams, grouped by whether or not they made the playoffs. Players with a top-10 salary are in bold.\n\nCaleb Williams: $9.9 million (rookie contract)\n\nBryce Young: $9.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nDrake Maye: $9.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nC.J. Stroud: $9.1 million (rookie contract)\n\nBo Nix: $4.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nDak Prescott, Cowboys: $60 million\n\nJoe Burrow, Bengals: $55 million\n\nTua Tagovailoa, Dolphins: $53.1 million\n\nLamar Jackson, Ravens: $52 million\n\nKyler Murray, Cardinals: $46.1 million\n\nKirk Cousins, Falcons: $45 million\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Chiefs: $45 million\n\nGeno Smith, Raiders: $37.5 million\n\nBaker Mayfield, Buccaneers: $33.3 million\n\nJustin Fields, Jets: $20 million\n\nDaniel Jones, Colts: $14 million\n\nCam Ward, Titans: $12.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nJayden Daniels, Commanders: $9.4 million (rookie contract)\n\nJ.J. McCarthy, Vikings: $5.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nJaxson Dart, Giants: $4.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nTyler Shough, Saints: $2.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nShedeur Sanders, Browns: $1.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nIt's notable that five of the 12 playoff quarterbacks are playing on rookie contracts, which are capped by the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThat cost control is extremely valuable, and optimizing roster construction around rookie quarterback contracts is a proven formula for success. Since the inception of the rookie wage scale in 2011, the Seattle Seahawks with Russell Wilson (2014 season) and the Kansas City Chiefs with Mahomes (2019 season) have navigated the rookie wage scale to Super Bowl victories.\n\nThis, season, the Patriots have an MVP candidate in Maye who's the ninth-highest paid player on the team. Nix playing on a $4.7 million salary has allowed the Broncos to build a Super Bowl contender despite Wilson's disastrous contract remaining on the books.\n\nStroud, meanwhile is a veteran quarterback in his third season who's surrounded by one of the NFL's fiercest defenses. It would not be a surprise to see any of them playing in or winning the Super Bowl in January.\n\nThis is an optimal way to build a Super contender in the short window available to pay quarterbacks on a rookie contract. This, of course, requires hitting successfully on a quarterback in the draft who can lead a team to contention at a young age.\n\nAnd it's also, obviously, not the only path to success. Thirteen of the 15 Super Bowls won since the inception of the rookie wage scale have been won by quarterbacks not playing on a rookie deal.\n\nAt some point, those rookie quarterbacks will be due for extensions. And if you've got a high-end quarterback on your hands who's due to be paid, there's little choice but to pay him. And that doesn't mean that you can't build a successful roster around said quarterback.\n\nYes, half of the top 10 paid quarterbacks will be watching the playoffs from home. But it's a little absurd to suggest that that's an indictment of paying top quarterbacks their market value.\n\nBurrow missed most of the season due to injury. Do the Bengals have also roster construction issues? Absolutely. But that's an issue that's plagued the franchise for pretty much the entirety of its existence under Brown family ownership, with or without a premium quarterback on the roster.\n\nThe Cowboys likewise have roster concerns that limited their upside. Like with the Bengals, it's fairer to take a look at the decades-long management under Jerry Jones (and the defense specifically this year) than point to the $60 million salary of Prescott, who was excellent this season, to explain why the Cowboys aren't in the playoffs.\n\nIt's difficult to argue that the Lions and Ravens didn't build strong rosters around Goff and Jackson. There's talent on both sides of the ball on both teams outside of their quarterbacks. And Jackson was clearly limited by injuries this season, while the Lions were ravaged by injuries of their own.\n\nIn the end, 14 of the league's 32 teams make the playoffs. The Ravens and Lions just missed out, but it wouldn't be a surprise for either or both to return to contention next season.\n\nAnd then there's Tagovailoa. His contract at this point was pretty clearly a mistake. He got benched at the end of the season, and his time in Miami very well may be done. The Dolphins would surely take a do-over on his deal of they could.\n\nBut the Prescott, Jackson, Burrow and Goff deals? There are surely no regrets from their respective franchises. Teams without high-end quarterbacks would certainly jump at the chance to take their contracts on.",

I cannot express properly in words how good we have been treated.\"\n\nThe Browns confirmed Andrew Berry, who was hired in 2020 alongside Stefanski, will remain as general manager.\n\nStefanski is the second NFL head coach to be fired following the end of the season after the Atlanta Falcons dismissed Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot on Sunday night.\n\nThe Falcons went back-to-back seasons with an 8-9 record under Morris, who joined in 2024, and failed to reach the play-offs during Fontenot's five-year stint.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAccording to several reports, the return of Pete Carroll as an NFL head coach will last only one season. The former Seahawks Super Bowl winner flamed out with the Raiders in 2025 in a short but tumultuous tenure at age 74.\n\nCarroll's defense disappointed with Patrick Graham calling plays. The offense was a dysfunctional mess with coordinator Chip Kelly being fired during the season.\n\nKeeping in mind that Tom Brady is part owner and the team is well-positioned to take a franchise QB high in the 2026 NFL Draft, here's looking at the top potential replacements for Carroll.\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT 2026:Raiders land Indiana's Fernando Mendoza at No. 1\n\nKlint Kubiak would be considered for his great pocket passing work with Sam Darnold in a balanced and explosive Seattle offense. He would be a great immediate personality and schematic influence on a rookie QB such as Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza or Oregon's Dante Moore.\n\nKliff Kingsbury is a good friend of Tom Brady's, having spent some time as a fellow Patriots QB. Kingsbury was huge in leading to a big rookie season for Jayden Daniels to help a quick turnaround in Washington in 2024. He also can provide that impact for Mendoza or Moore, as he was once attached to the Cardinals in 2019 when they were set to take Kyler Murray at No. 1 overall.\n\nMike LaFleur would be the top choice for Tom Brady and the ownership straight from the Sean McVay tree. He's overdue to get a job as the rising star younger brother of Packers coach Matt.\n\nVance Joseph would be a good defensive path to consider as he's become a stronger second-chance coaching candidate working under Sean Payton in Denver. He would help clean up things defensively and add some good experience.\n\nTom Brady can go after the former DC from his alma mater, Michigan, straight from fellow former Wolverines QB Jim Harbaugh. Jesse Minter is a rising star with his play-calling for the rival Chargers.\n\nTom Brady is a historian of the game and should also notice the strong influence and play-calling Chris Shula, the son of late Hall of Fame coaching legend Don, has done working on the other side of the ball from Mike LaFleur for McVay. Shula can provided needed youthful energy and motivation that was lost from Carroll.",
