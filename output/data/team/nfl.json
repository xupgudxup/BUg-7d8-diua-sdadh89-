    "fullText": "A Florida man shot and killed his wife and shot his stepdaughter earlier this week before fatally shooting himself after an argument over an NFL game, authorities said.\n\nJason Kenney, 47, took his own life hours after killing his wife, Crystal Kenney, Dec. 22, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a press conference.\n\nJudd said the murder occurred after Crystal Kenney suggested to her husband that he turn off Monday’s NFL game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFlorida Man Facing Death Penalty For Killing 18-Year-old Girlfriend, Unborn Child After She Refused Abortion\n\nJason Kenney had been drinking, and the argument escalated, prompting his wife to tell her 12-year-old son to call 911.\n\nThe boy ran to a neighbor’s home when he heard gunshots. Responding deputies found Crystal Kenney dead and a 13-year-old girl who had been shot in the shoulder and face.\n\nShe is recovering in a hospital.\n\n\"She said, ‘I begged him, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, and he shot me anyway,’\" Judd said.\n\nArkansas Mom Found Shot To Death With Two Children Wrote Cryptic Facebook Post Months Before Killings\n\nThe boy was unharmed, as was Jason and Crystal’s 1-year-old daughter, who was home at the time of the shooting. She was found by deputies asleep in her crib.\n\nAfter the shooting, Jason Kenney fled and called his sister, who lives in upstate New York, Judd said. He told her he had \"done something\" wrong and that it would be the last time they would talk.\n\nHe then drove to his father’s home, where deputies found him. As deputies attempted to get him out of a shed, Jason fatally shot himself, Judd said.\n\nDuring a search of the family’s home, deputies found a note Crystal wrote to her husband urging him to get help.\n\n\"You’re drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God,\" the note states, Judd said.\n\nThe surviving children are in the custody of grandparents.\n\n\"The entire family was destroyed,\" Judd said. \"Our homicide detectives are distraught. When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under it, just like the nuclear family should be.\"\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — From the moment they hit the gridiron, Mike and Blake Bell were inseparable.\n\nFor two identical twin brothers, a bond could be centered around anything, but for the Bell boys it was always football.\n\nFor nearly their entire lives, they were on the same team. In high school both attended Bishop Carroll, in college they both played for Colorado State, but on draft day things took a turn. Taken second overall by the Chiefs, Mike made Mark a promise.\n\n“The sports information guy said I needed to get over to Kansas City, and I told them, I wasn’t leaving until Mark got drafted,” said Mike Bell.\n\nAfter three rounds, Mark eventually got drafted in the fourth. In a time crunch, Mike would have to leave for Kansas City, but on the way there, he quickly learned that Mark was taken by an AFC West rival.\n\nMaize senior shooting guard leads by example on and off the field\n\n“I’m flying to Kansas City, and as I’m getting off the plane, the pilot comes out and says, I just wanna let you know they radioed up and your brother got drafted to the Seahawks,” said Mike Bell.\n\nThe two faced off twice a year on the opposite side of the ball, with Mike eventually getting the best of Mark in their NFL debut.\n\n“The first play wasn’t that good for me,” Mark said laughingly. “We had some really great memories, though. My mom and dad and the whole family would bring a bus down to Arrowhead to come watch us play, it was really special.”\n\nAnd with all of those great memories, come a legacy that the two brothers will share forever.\n\n“They remember us as the football guys, even though we’ve done different things since then, it’s amazing how that kind of follows you and it just goes with you for your whole life,” said Mike Bell.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

    "description": "The Broncos face the Chiefs in Kansas City on Christmas. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "When the NFL schedule makers sat down to craft the Christmas slate of games, they likely envisioned the clash between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs as a battle for the AFC West title.\n\nWhile the Chiefs have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Broncos can wrap up their first AFC West title since 2015 with a win tonight, and a little bit of help from the Houston Texans on Saturday. In addition, Denver can also secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but they will need a little more help here in Week 17 to clinch the top seed.\n\nLet’s start with the AFC West title. Denver can clinch the division title this week, officially bringing to an end the Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nIn addition, Denver can also wrap up the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week, and the lone bye week in the AFC playoffs.\n\nBut they would need a lot of help to get that done.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWith the Chiefs already eliminated from the playoffs, this game will not have any tiebreaker implications for the Chiefs and Broncos directly.\n\nBut it could play a role for the Broncos when it comes to seeding, in a very narrow scenario.\n\nLooking at the AFC West, the Broncos lead the division with a 12-3 record, while the Chargers are in second place with an 11-4 record. If Denver beats the Chiefs and the Chargers beat the Texans on Saturday, the two teams will meet in Week 18 with the division title up for grabs.\n\nWhy? Because the Chargers against Denver earlier this season, and another win in Week 18 in this scenario, would see the two teams finish at 13-4. The first tiebreaker in a division is head-to-head record, which woudl give the Chargers the AFC West title.\n\nThen the Broncos would be seeded somewhere from No. 5 to No. 7, depending on how the Bills finish, who could also end the year with a 13-4 record. If, again in this scenario, the Bills finish with the same 13-4 record as Denver, the tiebreaker will be conference record. Right now, Buffalo is at 8-3, and they have one AFC game remaining so they would finish at 9-3 in this scenario.\n\nDenver right now has a 7-3 record in AFC games, and would finish at 8-4 in this scenario, dropping them behind the Bills.\n\nAgain, this is a very specific hypothetical, but this game could matter in a tiebreaker scenario.",

Both players succeeded in big ways.\n\nHaulcy led LSU in tackles this past season with 88. He also added three interceptions, four passes broken up, and a forced fumble. He held his own in coverage and was a thumper in the run game. There's nothing else the Tigers could have asked him to do.\n\nThere was a four-week stretch where he finished with at least 12 tackles in each game. It felt like he was involved in every play that went into the box. His best individual game was in the losing effort against the Texas A&M Aggies, when he had 12 tackles with an interception and a pass break up.\n\nThe Texas native is a major college football success story. He came out of high school as a three-star recruit. 247Sports had him ranked as the 150th best safety in that class and the 266th best player in his home state.\n\nHe was viewed with more respect as a transfer, but he still ended up outplaying those expectations. He was the 151st player in the portal and the third-ranked safety. Now, he's going to be one of the first safeties taken in the NFL draft, receiving some second-round evaluations.\n\nHaulcy now becomes the third player from this Tigers team to declare for the draft, joining Delane and Aaron Anderson.",

    "fullText": "Chiefs vs. Broncos live score, updates, highlights from 2025 NFL Christmas game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Broncos\n\nThe NFL on Christmas Day delivers an AFC West rivalry matchup unlike any seen in the last decade, as the Denver Broncos (12-3) travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs (6-9) at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nIn a stunning reversal of roles, the Broncos enter as the dominant force, aiming to secure the AFC West title and remain firmly in the driver's seat for the conference's crucial No. 1 overall seed and the coveted first-round bye. With the Los Angeles Chargers breathing down their necks, a victory over the crippled Chiefs would officially clinch the AFC West for Denver, ending Kansas City's unprecedented nine-year reign as division champions and marking this holiday game as perhaps the most significant in Denver's last ten years.\n\nFor the three-time defending AFC Champion Chiefs, this prime-time holiday slot is a bittersweet stage for an unfamiliar role. Having already been officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era, the Chiefs have seen their season completely unravel, suffering a losing record for the first time since 2012. The franchise is currently battling devastating injuries, with Mahomes and his backup Gardner Minshew both sidelined by ACL injuries, leaving the offense to be managed by third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun. The team that was once the gatekeeper of the AFC has become a hollow shell of its dynasty self.\n\nThe stark contrast in stakes presents a unique challenge to the streaking Broncos, who must overcome a late-season loss to the Jaguars that snapped their 11-game winning streak. Head Coach Sean Payton is stressing focus, emphasizing that despite the Chiefs' struggles, a division title and the No. 1 seed are still their stated goals. A win in Kansas City, where the Broncos have historically struggled, would not only solidify their resurgence but would also serve as the ceremonial passing of the torch, ushering in a new era of dominance in the AFC West.\n\nThis Christmas night contest marks a seismic shift in the AFC power structure. What was once the annual, late-season coronation of the Chiefs is now the potential crowning moment for the Broncos — a team ready to reclaim the top spot in the AFC West and send a clear message to the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Chiefs vs. Broncos on Christmas.

    "description": "The NFL playoff picture is coming into focus. As the season winds through December and January, we’re highlighting each team that has clinched a spot in the 2025-26 NFL playoffs.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Playoffs get started on Saturday, January 10 with four teams kicking off the Wild Card round. The playoff field will feature 14 teams with 12 of them playing that first weekend and the No. 1 seed in each conference getting a bye to the Divisional Round. This year, the opening round features two games on Saturday, three games on Sunday, and one game on Monday.\n\nEight teams will face off in the Divisional round, with that weekend featuring two games on Saturday the 17th and two games on Sunday the 18th. The Conference Championship round follows with the final four teams facing off on Sunday the 25th. The final two teams square off in Santa Clara, California at Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, February 8, 2026.\n\nThe field is slowly filling up as teams punch their ticket for the 2026 NFL Playoffs. Below is each team that has clinched a playoff berth.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (34-26) to improve to 12-2.\n\nThe Broncos have not won a lot of pretty games this season, but they keep on chugging along. Bo Nix has made plays when they’ve mattered most and the Broncos have emerged as arguably the best team in the AFC. They clinched their playoff berth with a comeback win over the Packers and moved a game up on the Patriots for the No. 1 seed. They remain two games up on the Chargers and can clinch the AFC West title and the No. 1 seed with a win and some help in Week 16.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Detroit Lions (41-34) to improve to 11-3\n\nWeek 16 update: The Rams lost to the Seahawks in overtime on Thursday Night Football to drop to second place in the NFC West, pending the outcome of 49ers-Colts on Monday. LA is now 11-4.\n\nThe Rams are playing as well as anybody right now and are headed back to the playoffs. They fell behind by ten points against Detroit, but a big third quarter got them back and they controlled things in the fourth quarter. They are tied with the Seahawks atop the NFC West, but hold the tiebreaker edge for the time-being due to their first head-to-head win over Seattle back in Week 11. The two squads face off in Week 16 with first place in the division and the No. 1 seed in the NFC on the line.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Seahawks (38-37) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Seahawks won a wild overtime thriller over the Rams to clinch a playoff berth. More importantly than securing a playoff berth, the Seahawks moved into first place in the NFC West and took over the No. 1 seed in the conference. They’ve won five straight and close out the season one the road against the Panthers and 49ers. The division title will likely go down to the wire in Week 18.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Washington Commanders (29-18) to improve to 10-5.\n\nThe Eagles have struggled in recent weeks after a 4-0 start, but they are headed back to the playoffs. They rolled over the Commanders in the second half to clinch the NFC East title. It was their second straight win after losing three straight to the Cowboys, Bears, and Chargers. They will head into Week 17 sitting a game back of the Bears for the No. 2 seed and two back of the Seahawks for the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nThe 49ers still have to play on Monday Night Football, but they got good news on Sunday with the Lions loss to the Steelers. San Francisco still has a chance at the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the conference, but they at least know they are officially headed back to the playoffs. They host the Bears in Week 17 and finish the season against at home against the Seahawks.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (22-16) to improve to 11-4, coupled with the Detroit Lions losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nChicago has bigger things in mind, but they at least know they’ll be playing in the postseason. The Bears win the Packers firmed up their lead in the NFC North, and they now have a division-clinching scenario in Week 17. The Bears travel to face the 49ers next week and close out the season at home against the Lions.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Baltimore Ravens (28-24) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Patriots held off Derrick Henry and the Ravens to punch their ticket to the 2026 NFL Playoffs. They remain a game up on the Bills in the AFC East and can clinch the division title next week with a win and a Bills loss. They also moved into a tie with the Broncos for the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Denver has the tiebreaker heading into Week 17 based on the common games tiebreaker.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Denver Broncos (34-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Jaguars are headed back to the playoffs for the first time in three years. They clinched a wild card berth, but will be more focused on the division title. They head into week 17 with an 11-4 record and a one-game lead on the Texans for the division title. They sit in third place in the overall NFC standings and are a game back of the Patriots and Broncos for the top two seeds.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Cleveland Browns (23-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Bills punched their ticket, but the division title is still a possibility. The Patriots lost in Week 16, and the Bills win moved them to only a game back in the division. Buffalo is currently the sixth seed and is riding a four-game win streak as they head toward the playoffs.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Dallas Cowboys (34-17) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Chargers are headed back to the playoffs for a second straight season. They are guaranteed a spot, but still have a shot at the AFC West title. The Broncos loss in Week 16 allowed the Chargers to cut the division lead to one game with two weeks remaining. The Chargers and Broncos face off in Denver in Week 18, so if both teams win in Week 17, that game will be for the division title, and maybe the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Minnesota Vikings (23-10)\n\nThe Packers had two clinching scenarios, one if they won or tied their game against the Ravens on Saturday of Week 17, and one if the Lions lost or tied their game against the Vikings. Detroit ended up losing and Green Bay punched their ticket. The Packers are effectively two games back of the Bears in the NFC North, but they still have a chance at the division title if they can win out and the Bears lose out.",

    "description": "The Lions face the Vikings in Minneapolis on Christmas Day. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "Game result: The Lions are officially done for the season. They have one more game, but they will not be headed to the playoffs. They committed six turnovers, including five by quarterback Jared Goff in a 23-10 loss to the Vikings. The Lions defense kept the team in it, holding the Vikings to only two touchdowns in spite of all the turnovers, but Detroit’s offense could get nothing done.\n\nThe Lions loss also helped the Packers punch their playoff ticket. Green Bay could have clinched their own spot with a win on Saturday over the Ravens, but now they head into that game looking to gain ground on the Bears in the NFC North.\n\nThe Detroit Lions sit on the verge of playoff elimination and need help the final two weeks of the 2025-26 NFL regular season. They can help themselves to start when they face the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas Day. The game kicks off at 4:30 p.m. ET and Detroit is a 5.5-point road favorite.\n\nThis is the second matchup of the season between these two teams. The Vikings won 27-24 in the first game in Detroit. J.J. McCarthy made his return from a high ankle sprain to throw for two touchdowns. The team added 142 rushing yards and held the Lions ground game to just 65 in the win. McCarthy will not play in this game due to a fracture in his throwing hand. Max Brosmer will get the start in his place.\n\nThe Lions had a chance to climb back into the mix last week, but a loss to the Steelers cost them. They have no control over their destiny and could be eliminated regardless of their outcome this week. The Lions are eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to the Vikings or if the Packers win or tie against the Ravens on Saturday. Green Bay is a 2.5-point favorite at home in that game.\n\nEven if the Lions win and the Packers lose, they would still need to win in Week 18 at the Bears and have the Packers lose on the road to the Vikings. It’s possible this could happen, but the odds are not great.\n\nUsing The Athletic playoff simulator, the Lions currently have a 4% chance of making the playoffs. If they beat the Vikings and the Packers lose to the Ravens, their chances increase to 14%.\n\nTiebreakers don’t matter in this situation due to the Packers having a tie on their record. Green Bay has the head-to-head tiebreaker over Detroit, but if the Lions tie the Vikings or Bears to close they season, they are eliminated from playoff contention.",

    "fullText": "On Dec. 22, 2022, Bret Bielema received a Christmas present from Starkville, Mississippi: Ole Miss Quarterback Luke Altmyer transferring to the Illinois Fighting Illini. With three years of eligibility remaining, it would give Bielema and the Illini some much-needed time and the option of stability under center.\n\nThe first year did not go entirely as planned. Altmyer got his feet wet, but his numbers were not that good. He played only nine games due to injury, but he had some good games that gave Illini fans an idea of what to expect, completing 175 passes in 270 attempts (64.8%). He threw for 1,883 yards (209.2 YPG) with 13 TD and 10 INTs (his QB rating was 131.9). He also rushed for 282 yards on 94 carries with three TDs.\n\nIn 2024, his improvement was nothing short of remarkable. Whereas the year prior, he looked rattled at times and unsure of where or when to throw the ball. In ‘24, he seemed more poised, more confident, and better able to read the field. He passed for 2,717 yards, 211 completions in 347 passes with 22 TDs and only six interceptions (a 144.0 QB rating). His rushing yards were down 217 yards on 99 carries with 4 TDs, but that was due to inconsistent line play, allowing 32 sacks.\n\nThis season, he has continued to improve. With a bowl game yet to play, he has already surpassed his yards total from last season, 2,811 yards on 226 of 332 passing. He has attained his highest completion percentage of 68.1% and his highest passer rating of 157.1. He has 21 TDs with only five interceptions.\n\nAltmyer will go down as one of the best quarterbacks in Illinois history. Many people have said he is the best QB at Illinois since Kurt Kittner, with some comparing his leadership to Jeff George. Here are some of the reasons why.\n\nMost TDs in a career tied for 2nd with Juice Williams at 56 (leader is Kurt Kittener with 64).\n\nMost passing yards he is 5th with 7,411(626 yards behind 4th place Juice Williams).\n\nCompletion percentage among starters is 1st at 64.5%.\n\nTD% % with over 500 attempts at 5.9.\n\nYards per play with over 1,000 yards 2nd 7.4 (John Paddock leads with 8.9).\n\nYards per game 3rd at 218 (Tony Eason is 1st with 300.4 and Dave Wilson is 2nd with 286.7)\n\nPasser rating as a starter (minimum 10 starts) at 145.\n\nHow he is looked at nationally:\n\nESPN has him rated as the 12th best in the NCAA this season\n\nProfootballnetwork.com has him listed as #8 in QB power rankings going into the upcoming bowl game.\n\nHe is in the top 25 nationally for completion percentage (68.1%) and passing touchdowns (21).\n\nMost draft analysts have Altmyer as a fifth to seventh-round draft pick. They cite him as being a stable NFL backup QB in a West Coast or RPO offensive scheme.\n\nAmong the attributes they like about him are his performance in clutch situations, his release and touch, his ability to throw high-velocity, accurate passes, his read progression in passing situations, his ability to navigate the pocket, his toughness, his preparedness, and his mental approach to the game.\n\nSome of the cons to his game are his frame, as they cite at 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds, whether he has the durability to withstand an NFL pass rush competition, a hitch in his throwing motion under pressure, the ability to throw in tight coverage, and an athletic ceiling not being a modern dual threat QB.\n\nHe is being compared to NFL backups Cooper Rush and Gardner Minshew in terms of his NFL trajectory. In four mock drafts I have seen so far, he could be taken in the fifth round by Tampa Bay, the sixth round by Minnesota, or the seventh round by either the Bears or Houston.\n\nWith one game to go and an invite to the Senior Bowl, it is a fair bet to say that in the fall of 2026, Luke Altmyer will be on an NFL roster somewhere, probably as a trusted backup. I can see the four teams mentioned in the mock draft models, but I would not rule out teams like Pittsburgh, San Francisco, New England, or Green Bay. Certainly, back-to-back bowl wins would improve his stock, as will a good showing in the Senior Bowl. All in all, the future looks very good for Luke Altmyer.",

He'll still throw the ball, but he may not land as many completions as he would like.\n\nYou can expect at least two of his passes to find the end zone, however.\n\nBo Nix Over 13.5 rushing yards\n\nUnder 238.5 passing yards\n\nUnder 21.5 passing completions\n\nDenver is a monster favorite on Christmas Day, meaning the Broncos won't have to throw much while up big. They'll be able to run the clock down, and as mentioned, the Chiefs will blitz enough times to get Nix out of the pocket where he can scamper past this modest rushing total.\n\nBet on Thursday Night Football at bet365, where your wagers are never ordinary! \n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "Mile High Report’s Christopher Hart gives his picks for Week 17 of the 2025 NFL regular season.",
    "fullText": "Week 17 of the NFL regular season is upon us. Only two more weeks of regular season picks are left. My Week 16 picks were not optimal. I picked just 9 of 16 games correctly. Through fifteen weeks I’m now sitting at 160-80 with predictions. Let’s see if I can do better than I did last week.\n\nChristmas Day (Early Game) —Dallas Cowboys at Washington Commanders\n\nHad events played out differently in the regular season, this game could have been garnered huge playoff implications. Unfortunately, these NFC East rivals are both eliminated from playoff contention. I think the Cowboys end up winning this one on the road.\n\nChristmas Day (Afternoon Game) — Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe only way the Lions can make the playoffs is by winning out and the Packers losing their final two games. It’s a longshot, but stranger things have happened. Not that he has been great, but J.J. McCarthy won’t be playing in this one. That being said, I think Detroit will win this one easily.\n\nChristmas Day (Night Game) — Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Broncos lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars last Sunday. Denver still controls their own destiny and can earn the AFC’s top seed if they beat the Chiefs and Chargers the next two weeks. They’ve got a lot of mistakes to clean up, but I have a feeling they will deliver Broncos Country a present on Christmas night and beat Kansas City.\n\nSaturday Football (Afternoon Game) — Houston Texans at Los Angeles Chargers\n\nBoth the Texans and Chargers are poised to make the postseason. The only question is will it be as a wildcard team or division champion. The stakes are huge for both of them. Houston’s defense has been the strength of their team and Justin Herbert has impressed despite numerous key losses to their offensive line. All things considered, I think DeMeco Ryans has his team ready to win this one.\n\nDeMeco Ryans on the game vs the Chargers:\n\n“No doubt about it. It’s defintley a playoff game. It was a playoff game for us last week. That’s where you want to be in December, playing meaningful games & that’s what this team has earned.” pic.twitter.com/sRbAg9pofV\n\n— Houston Stressans (@TexansCommenter) December 23, 2025\n\nSaturday Football (Evening Game) — Baltimore Ravens at Green Bay Packers\n\nThe Ravens aren’t out of the playoffs yet, but their chances of making the postseason are slim. Currently, the Packers are the NFC’s seventh seed and can punch their playoff ticket with a win. With a back contusion suffered in Week 16, there is a good chance Lamar Jackson doesn’t play. If so, that should make the Packers heavy favorites in this one. I’m taking Green Bay at home.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Arizona Cardinals at Cincinnati Bengals\n\nThis Sunday game is an uninteresting matchup with two teams out of playoff contention. After laying a goose egg a few weeks ago, the Bengals kicked things into high gear last weekend and scored a lot of points. I think they will do the same on Sunday, as the Cardinals are in a tailspin having lost seven games in a row. I’m picking Cincinnati.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Pittsburgh Steelers at Cleveland Browns\n\nThe formula is simple for the Steelers to make the postseason. A win over the Browns guarantees them the AFC North title and the opportunity to host a Wild Card round playoff game. Could the Browns play spoiler? Sure, but don’t count on that. I’m confident that Pittsburgh takes care of business here.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — New Orleans Saints at Tennessee Titans\n\nThe Saints have won three in a row and are now 5-10 on the season. Meanwhile, the Titans are a 3-12 team coming off a victory against the Chiefs in Week 16. There isn’t anything compelling about this matchup to really write about. That being said, I’ll take New Orleans on the road.\n\nTHREE IN A ROW DUBS#Saints | @Gatorade pic.twitter.com/br2Fm49xjA\n\n— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) December 21, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis Colts\n\nThe Jaguars earned a playoff berth defeating the Broncos last weekend. They have a path to the AFC’s top seed, though it will take some help. In order for that to happen, beating the Colts who have dropped five games in a row is a must. Based on what I saw against Denver last Sunday, I like their chances against Indianapolis.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Miami Dolphins\n\nThe Buccaneers started off the season hot but have dropped three games in a row. They have to win this game, and the Panthers need to lose against the Seahawks in order to keep their postseason hopes alive. I’m expecting both of those things to happen, with the Week 18 Buccaneers/Panthers matchup deciding who wins the NFC South.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — New England Patriots at New York Jets\n\nThe Patriots have a path to the top seed in the AFC. In order for that potentiality to become reality, finding a way to beat the Jets on the road needs to take place. I have no concerns about their ability to do so. I don’t think this game will be close at all. I’ve got New England winning on the road in a landslide.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Seattle Seahawks at Carolina Panthers\n\nThe Seahawks defied the odds and rallied late to defeat the Rams in Week 16, whilst the Panthers were able to defeat Tampa Bay. Both these teams want this game. Seattle winning would pretty much assure them the top seed in the NFC. A Panthers win would give them a shot at the NFC South title if the Buccaneers wind up losing. A lot is at stake in this one, but I think Seattle gets a huge road win.\n\nThe Rams would be eliminated from both the #1 seed and NFC West title race if the Seahawks beat the Panthers and the 49ers beat the Bears in Week 17. pic.twitter.com/5H1p6Zi0Ba\n\n— Brian Nemhauser (@hawkblogger) December 23, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — New York Giants at Las Vegas Raiders\n\nSporting 2-13 records, the Giants and Raiders are the worst teams in their respective conferences. The loser of this game will have the upper hand relative to earning the #1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. But maybe something crazy happens and it ends in a tie. Who knows? I don’t really care. I’ll just pick the Giants for the heck of it.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills\n\nBoth the Eagles and Bills have clinched playoff berths. Philadelphia won the NFC East and will get to host a playoff game. The Bills aren’t out of the AFC East race yet but need some help for that to happen. I ultimately expect the Patriots to take that division. Even so, I think the Bills beat the Eagles. It should be a fun matchup either way.\n\nSunday Night Football — Chicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers\n\nBoasting 11-4 records, the Bears and 49ers are also in the postseason. Each team has a slim path to the top seed in the NFC. What both of them have accomplished this year is impressive. I certainly didn’t have either of them securing 11 wins this season. This might be the most fun matchup of Week 17 and should be a great primetime game for all football fans to enjoy. I’m taking the 49ers in this one.\n\nMonday Night Football — Los Angeles Rams at Atlanta Falcons\n\nThe Rams definitely need to find a way to win this game after being stunned by the Seahawks in Week 16. Dropping that game plummeted their chances of being the NFC’s top seed. I’ve got Los Angeles winning this one. And guess what? A victory will make the first-round pick they get from Atlanta better in the ‘26 NFL Draft.",

However, they'll be the opening act for the NFL on Christmas.\n\nThe Cowboys' season was a tale of two sides of the ball. The Dallas offense was one of the more exciting units in the entire league. With Dak Prescott playing at an elite level, throwing the ball to both CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, it was thrilling to watch the Cowboys' offensive attack.\n\nHowever, their defense was one of the worst in the NFL. It got so bad that Jerry Jones brought in some defensive assets to help the struggling unit. While it seemed to improve the defense's overall state, it was not enough to save their season.\n\nAs for the Commanders, it was an unlucky season to say the least. Every week it felt like another key player on their team was injured. Whether it was Jayden Daniels, Terry McLaurin, Austin Ekeler and the list goes on.\n\nWhile neither team has anything to gain, there's always a level of effort for divisional games.\n\nHere's how to listen to Commanders vs. Cowboys on Christmas.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channel 225 (away), 226 (home)\n\nCommanders radio channels: BIG 100 (WBIG-FM 100.3 FM)\n\nCowboys radio channel: 105.3 The Fan (KRLD-FM)\n\nThe Commanders vs. Cowboys game can be listened to on SiriusXM on channels 225 (Cowboys), and 226 (Commanders)\n\nLocally, fans in the Washington area can tune into BIG 100 (WBIG-FM 100.3 FM). In Dallas, fans can listen on 105.3 The Fan (KRLD-FM).\n\nIf you are a new subscriber to SiriusXM, you can get your first month for free. Listen to every NFL game live, plus other sports like college football, MLB, NBA, NHL, NASCAR and more.

    "fullText": "This week, Chiefs Wire's Ed Easton Jr. spoke with retired All-Pro offensive lineman and CBS Sports analyst Kyle Long.\n\nIn his interview with Easton Jr., Long discussed his role as a remote analyst for NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix today.\n\n\"I will be on the desk with Scott Hanson in Los Angeles, and it'll go out to the rest of the world. Obviously, many people will be watching on Netflix. Every single time you see one of those guys run on the field with the orange gloves and say, TV timeout, or the players get a breather, they'll throw it back to the studio,\" said Long, \"Scott and I will be covering all the happenings from that drive, looking ahead, all the storylines you could think of. Obviously, as people watch, they will try to interact. We'll have multiple opportunities to engage in back-and-forth with people around the world. It's a dream come true for me; Christmas and football are always synonymous, just as Thanksgiving is. Nobody does it like Netflix.\"\n\nNFL CHRISTMAS GAMEDAY\nLIVE on Netflix December 25\n-- \nCowboys vs. Commanders @ 1 PM ET\nLions vs. Vikings @ 4:30 PM ET\n\n— Netflix (@netflix) December 4, 2025\n\nLong, a former Kansas City Chiefs player, discussed the Detroit Lions-Minnesota Vikings matchup, which carries postseason implications for Detroit in the NFC North.\n\n\"You've got to keep in mind this Lions team, they went from winless to the bullies to now, you know, middle of the pack, and I think it's almost poetic, because I feel like a Dan Campbell team is not supposed to be at the top of the heap,\" said Long, \"They're supposed to be scratching and clawing their way in. I believe this aligns with the 'MO' (Main Objective) in Detroit. We've got to earn it. We've got to scratch and claw.\"\n\nKansas City notably defeated Detroit earlier this season in Week 6 at Arrowhead Stadium, while the Vikings will play spoiler as hosts of the second game of the doubleheader.\n\n\"The Minnesota Vikings. I mean, I don't know if you're on social media, but there's been a lot of memes about the Minnesota Vikings, particularly their young quarterback, and what I've seen is that the defense has rallied around this guy. \"The protectors on the offensive side rally around this guy,\" said Long. \"You take a look around the NFC North, and the Bears and the Packers are the two teams most likely to make the playoffs. These two teams are fighting for respect, and they know that next year starts now, especially for a guy like J.J. McCarthy. We know how good their coach is. We know about their defense, but the one big question mark is that quarterback. So we're going to find out more about that on Christmas.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kyle Long explains his role on Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

    "fullText": "NFL execs recently weighed in on who they believe should be the NFL's Coach of the Year, and among those mentioned was the Jacksonville Jaguars' Liam Coen.\n\nThe NFL Network's Tom Pelissero polled 30 execs, asking them to vote on who they believe should win each major end-of-season award, such as MVP, Coach of the Year, and others.\n\nWhen it came to Coach of the Year, New England's Mike Vrabel was the clear-cut winner if it were up to the NFL execs. He received 13 votes.\n\nChicago's Ben Johnson was second with six votes, while Coen was third with four votes.\n\nUnder Coen, the Jaguars have made one of the biggest turnarounds in football, going from four wins a season ago to 11 wins with still two games left in the regular season.\n\nJacksonville has clinched a playoff spot, but they also still find themselves in the mix for the AFC's No. 1 seed.\n\nTrevor Lawrence is playing some of the best football of his career over the last month under Coen. The offense has scored 30-plus points in five of their last eight games as well.\n\nNot to be overlooked either is the staff that Coen has assembled around him, which includes offensive coordinator Grant Udinski and defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile, who has turned the Jaguars into a takeaway-heavy defense.\n\nHowever, perhaps what stands out the most about this Coen-led Jaguars team is their resiliency.\n\nAfter blowing a 19-point fourth-quarter lead to Houston, the Jaguars were 5-4, and it felt like a fork in the road moment for this team. But since then, Jacksonville has won six games in a row, which tells us a lot about the makeup of this team under Coen's leadership.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: NFL execs put Jaguars Liam Coen in Coach of the Year conversation",

    "description": "The NFL post-season may be without Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow, but what went wrong for the star quarterbacks, and who is most likely to bounce back?",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs are out of contention for this season's NFL play-offs and so too are their conference rivals Cincinnati.\n\nI just don't see the Baltimore Ravens getting in either. They need to win their last two games to have a chance, so in terms of quarterbacks, that would be a three-headed monster missing from the AFC - Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes.\n\nAll three having injuries this season is just wild, and Jackson went off with another in Sunday's loss to New England. He's already missed three games and in each of the past six weeks has missed at least one day of practice.\n\nI don't think he's ever fully recovered from the main hamstring injured he had. There was one game where it was like \"hey, he's back. He's moving like the Lamar Jackson that we're used to\".\n\nBut if you look at his other injuries - toe, ankle, knee, and now his back - I feel like he's a bit more fragile at the moment, after all the hits he's taken. He's had injuries adding up over the years, so is his style of play sustainable?\n\nI really hope his Super Bowl window hasn't closed because he's so wonderful to watch.\n\nI just think there needs to be a bit of a shake-up at Baltimore because there were some odd moments in Sunday's game, with the play calling and top players making big mistakes in big moments. At the end of the season, someone's got to take responsibility.\n\nThe two main things they've struggled with is Lamar not being healthy and having zero pass rush. I just don't understand it - defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike went down early in the season, so why you wouldn't find an impact player from a pass-rush perspective?\n\nThe Ravens used to have this attitude. Teams used to be scared of that pass rush, that defensive line, and they've kind of lost that.\n\nIt's the same with the Bengals and Chiefs. Although you keep winning, and that means you don't have high draft picks, you've got to be able to build depth in those moments.\n\nIf you're investing on one side of the ball, you've got to draft on the other side. You've got to find ways to strengthen an already elite team - the team that's done it best is the Philadelphia Eagles and their general manager Howie Roseman.",

    "fullText": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (WGN) — While Caleb Williams, DJ Moore and the Chicago Bears’ offense received most of the praise for last weekend’s dramatic, come-from-behind victory over the Green Bay Packers, it would have never happened had it not been for kicker Cairo Santos.\n\nIn a press release on Wednesday, the NFL announced Santos was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for Week 16 after his efforts in the Bears’ 22-16 overtime win versus the Packers.\n\nHow improbable was the Chicago Bears’ OT win over the Green Bay Packers?\n\n“Cairo navigating the wind … It was just unbelievable with the gusty conditions out there. You guys saw all of the paper cups and all of the things flying and floating all over the field,” Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower said. “For him to have the mental fortitude to stay focused and play the conditions is what we talk about doing.\n\n“Not trying to beat the conditions, not being upset about the conditions, but play the conditions. I thought he did an excellent job of that and struck the ball really well … It helped us a ton.”\n\nSantos converted all three of his field goal attempts in a driving wind—from 46, 51 and 43 yards—and his lone point-after attempt. He was also the only NFC kicker to score at least 10 points and make 100% of his kicks, including one from 50 yards or longer.\n\n“It was super gusty. It was a tough day today,” Santos said after the game. “My first 46-yarder was against the wind, and all the other ones were with the wind. IN the fourth quarter, we were kicking with the wind, but it was more of a crosswind. So, we just had to play a perfect ball and trust it.”\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, wind gusts reached as high as 25-30 mph on Saturday at Soldier Field.\n\nOn top of his ten points scored, he also helped Chicago’s special teams unit recover an onside kick with 1:59 remaining in regulation against Green Bay.\n\n“Cairo’s done so much work on campus here, and he’s done it in the offseason too—I’m talking about all different types of kicks,” Hightower said. “I’ve tried to stop him at times from kicking onside kicks so much, like, ‘Hey, it’s time to go in.’ And he keeps doing it. There’s so much work that’s been put in from that standpoint that it’s not an accident.\n\n“He put work in for it and he hit a really good ball.”\n\nHis one make from 50+, a 51-yarder in the fourth quarter, was his 25th made field goal of 50-plus yards as a member of the Bears, the most by any kicker in franchise history.\n\n“I don’t have many words, man. It’s special to do this with you guys—coaches, players,” Santos said after receiving a game ball from Ben Johnson in the postgame locker room.\n\nOver the last two seasons, under Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower, the Bears have earned five Special Teams Player of the Week awards, tied with the Denver Broncos for the most in the NFL.",

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

But the NFL is now following up with the team after hearing from DK Metcalf and others in his appeal hearing. pic.twitter.com/H4nyqbLX1K\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 24, 2025\n\n“The matter remains under review,” an NFL spokesman told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review in an email.\n\nMetcalf's two-game suspension was upheld, the league announced Tuesday evening, ending his regular season.\n\nThe incident occurred in the second quarter of Sunday's game. While the Lions' offense was on the field, Metcalf approached a fan sitting in the front row and wearing a blue wig. After exchanging words with the fan, Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at the fan's head.\n\nWhile the incident was captured on the broadcast, it was not seen by officials.\n\nDK Metcalf appears to have an altercation with a Detroit fan pic.twitter.com/a478Zjg3tR\n\n— NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) December 21, 2025\n\nBecause of that, Metcalf was not penalized and was not ejected from the contest.\n\nThe fan claimed Metcalf threw a punch because the fan taunted the wideout with his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius.\n\nOn Monday, however, sources told Tom Pelissero of NFL Network that the fan used a derogatory term when taunting Metcalf about his mother. That source also claimed the fan called Metcalf \"something we both know you don't call a Black man.\"\n\nThe fan's attorney released a statement Monday calling the allegations against the fan, Ryan Kennedy, \"completely false.\"\n\n\"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the 'N-word,' the 'C-word,' or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game.\n\n\"These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nDuring his Tuesday news conference, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said that although he doesn't condone Metcalf's actions, he supports the wide receiver.\n\n“He did explain to me why he did what he did, and I certainly don’t condone the behavior, but I support DK,\" Tomlin said. \"And I really don’t have a lot to add other than what I just told you.\"\n\nKennedy was escorted from his seat but not ejected from the stadium. The Lions told The Athletic on Tuesday that the team did not plan to take action against Kennedy.\n\nThe Steelers finish the regular season against the Cleveland Browns this Sunday and the Baltimore Ravens in Week 18. Pittsburgh can wrap up the AFC North title this week by beating Cleveland or with a loss by the Ravens to the Green Bay Packers.",

    "description": "Here’s how we think the Denver Broncos will do vs the Kansas City Chiefs during Week 17 action in the NFL.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos will look to turn the page quickly on their tough loss a few days ago with a road win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. The Chiefs are down to their third string quarterback and have nothing left to play for. This is a game the Broncos should win and if they don’t, then the real questions begin.\n\nWe’re pretty confident that this won’t be the case. The Broncos should coast to victory like they did against Kansas City in the final game of last season when they were resting starters instead of being long-eliminated from contention.\n\nDenver Broncos at Kansas City ChiefsP.M. Mile High time\nGEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri\nATS Betting Lines: Denver -13.5\nMoneyline Odds: Denver -1200 / Kansas City +750\nOver/Under: 36.5\nNote: All odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nCollectively, our Mile High Report staff is predicting a Broncos 27-11 win on the road over the Chiefs. Here’s how each of us predicted things would go individually:\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe line in this game is crazy…. if only because the over/under stands at 36.5. They expect the Chiefs offense to sputter and the Broncos offense to be ho-hum. I checked the weather and that isn’t going to be a factor at all it appears. Given all that, I’ll be cheeky here and predict a backdoor cover and an under. Now I just wait for the officiating crew to make it happen! – Tim Lynch\n\nThis one isn’t difficult. The Broncos should beat the Chiefs. It shouldn’t be close. The defense will be looking to make a statement, which should mean bad things for a 3rd string QB. Bo Nix will want some redemption from the loss to Jacksonville. – Adam Malnati\n\nAfter an incredible 11-game winning streak, the Broncos finally suffered their first loss since Week 3 of the regular season. On Christmas, they will play the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Even though the Chiefs will be playing their third-string quarterback, Denver can’t underestimate their division rival. The Broncos have to play a complete game, limit the miscues and mistakes, and find a way to win. Their hopes of an AFC West title and #1 seed depend on it. Ultimately, I believe the Broncos can bounce back to get their thirteenth win of the season. – Chris Hart\n\nNix and the Broncos should win this game. As others have noted, KC is down to their third-string QB and have been eliminated from the AFC Playoffs. But crazy things happen in December at Arrowhead. So Denver can’t look passed this game or just lollygag and expect to get the win. Approach this game like a must-win game, which it is, and put the poor showing against the Jags behind everyone. Take nothing for granted, play a complete game, and make Chiefs Kingdom’s Christmas a little less enjoyable. – Ian St. Clair",

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals need a quarterback this offseason. The question is whether they'll be able to find one in the first round of the NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "How have we gotten here? This Arizona Cardinals’ season was supposed to lead to the playoffs. At the very least, it was supposed to lead to contention. Christmas week should have been about setting the stage for a heavyweight showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nInstead, the Bengals are 5-10 and the Cardinals are somehow even worse, at 3-12.\n\nSo now, that familiar time of year has arrived, far earlier than anyone had hoped. It’s mock draft season.\n\nThis year’s draft class is widely considered to be a thin group, but that’s OK for the Cardinals. They currently hold the No. 6 pick. The big question, though, is where they’ll be able to find their quarterback of the future.\n\nSo for the first time, here are our top 10 projected picks of the 2026 NFL Draft. As always, this mock draft is without trades.\n\nIf the Giants do ultimately end up with the No. 1 pick, a trade becomes highly likely. New York already has a promising young quarterback, Jaxson Dart, while the rest of the top 10 is packed with quarterback-needy teams — including the Cardinals, of course.\n\nWould Arizona pony up the package required for the top selection? That’s a question for general manager Monti Ossenfort and, potentially, head coach Jonathan Gannon, if he retains his job. But it might be the best path to a quarterback, given the teams currently ahead of them.\n\nIf the Giants beat the Raiders this week, though, Las Vegas will jump into the No. 1 spot. Unlike the Giants, the Raiders desperately need quarterback help and would not likely trade the pick.\n\nAs for Reese, he could be the top non-quarterback off the board, as a versatile, explosive player who can line up off the edge or at linebacker. It’s just unlikely it will actually be at the No. 1 pick after trades.\n\nMendoza, this year’s Heisman Trophy winner, is noted for his elite football intelligence and ability to play on-time within an offense. If this Cardinals’ coaching staff remains in place, that will be an appealing proposition, given that they preferred Jacoby Brissett to Kyler Murray for those reasons. The problem will be getting a high enough draft pick to secure Mendoza, who is the betting favorite for the top pick.\n\nSome expect Moore to remain in school, as he has made just 18 career starts and could earn a nice NIL payday if he returned to Oregon. But as his draft stock climbs, so too do his chances of declaring. That would be a major boost for the Cardinals, who need as many quarterbacks as possible in this class to help their chances of finding one. On the field, Moore stands out with his accuracy and creativity as a passer.\n\nAs has been the case for most of the past five decades, the Jets need a quarterback this spring. But if they end up behind the Raiders and Browns, that might require a trade up. Fortunately for New York, they have five first-round picks over the next two years — ammunition that the Cardinals can’t match.\n\nAs for Bain, he’s a powerful edge rusher who just notched three sacks against Texas A&M in the College Football Playoff. He could be the first defensive player off the board.\n\nUnlike the quarterback-needy teams around them, the Titans are in a great spot. Their top offseason priority will be finding talent to help support Cam Ward. And no matter where they end up, they should be able to draft either Tate or Jordyn Tyson, the top two wide receivers.\n\nSo, this is the Cardinals’ conundrum. Only two quarterbacks are currently seen as top-five picks, and one of them might stay in college.\n\nTrading up would be expensive, especially for a team that has holes all over its roster. Ty Simpson — the potential third quarterback off the board — would be a reach. There are few good options, unless their pick moves up over the next two weeks.\n\nAll of that could leave the Cardinals looking to another position. That’s where Fano comes in. He’s an athletic player who is widely considered the top tackle in the class. Pairing him with Paris Johnson Jr. would give the Cardinals their tackle duo of the future and boost an offensive line that has struggled in 2025.\n\nPurely from a talent perspective, Love might be the best player in this class. But as with Ashton Jeanty last year, the issue is positional value. Washington would be passing up on much-needed defensive help to draft Love.\n\nStill, the idea is tantalizing: a hyper-talented running back to pair with Jayden Daniels. That would give Washington one of the league’s most dangerous rushing attacks and reduce the need for Daniels to play hero ball, potentially helping him stay healthier.\n\nTyler Shough has been a pleasant late-season surprise, removing the Saints from the list of teams that need quarterback help. Drafting Tyson to pair with Chris Olave would suddenly create the potential for an exciting offense in New Orleans.\n\nWhile a homecoming with Tyson might be enticing for local fans — especially after missing out on Cam Skattebo last year — the fit doesn’t make much sense for the Cardinals. Wide receiver is one of their few positions of strength.\n\nIn many ways, Downs is the Jeremiyah Love of the defensive side — an elite talent at a non-premium position. The Bengals, though, need all the help they can get on defense, no matter where it comes. Downs would be a nice fit.\n\nSimpson is the wild card of this quarterback class. He could return to college, with only one year of starting experience under his belt. He could also slip to the back of the first round, due to both his lack of his experience and his struggles late in the season. Or teams could be wooed by his processing ability and early-season tape, shooting him up draft boards. All three options are on the table for now.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Early Arizona Cardinals 2026 NFL mock draft",

McCarthy (hand) out this week. pic.twitter.com/Dz1iknCZSL\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 23, 2025\n\nBefore this past Monday’s primetime game, the Colts waived Rypien, who had previously been signed to the active roster a week prior to serve as the QB3 against Seattle, in order to create a spot for activated veteran starting defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, coming off injured reserve.\n\nIt was a little bit surprising that the Colts didn’t elect to carry Rypien and declare him inactive—as a possibility as the emergency QB3 during Monday night’s loss. It’s not that there was a strong chance he would need to be called upon by any means, but a 44-year-old Philip Rivers is presumably at least a little less durable than the average NFL starter, and especially fresh off his couch and with five years of retirement.\n\nNot to mention, rookie Riley Leonard is just a few weeks removed from a knee injury, who has been serving as the Colts’ QB2 since Rivers’ surprising arrival.\n\nAt any rate, Rypien’s stint with the Colts ends without him appearing in an NFL game. The 29-year-old veteran quarterback was signed to the Indianapolis practice squad in mid-October before his signing and release.\n\nHe now reunites with the Vikings, his old squad that he spent last season with and this entire past offseason. However, he has yet to appear in an NFL game Minnesota either. In his 5-year career, he has appeared in 11 games, making 4 starts though.\n\nFor the Colts, Rypien was presumably a candidate to return to their practice squad—should he clear waivers. However, it appears as though he’ll be taking at least a brief pit stop in Minnesota until McCarthy returns.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDuring a key matchup between the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, DK Metcalf gave the NFL an incident to settle.\n\nThe Steelers' star receiver, in his first year with the team as it pursues the AFC North title, was seen swiping at a Lions fan in the stands as he stood on Pittsburgh's sideline at Ford Field.\n\nBecause officials didn't see the interaction, which was caught by the CBS broadcast, Metcalf wasn't disciplined in the game — but he was considered sure to be hearing from the NFL afterward. On Monday, the NFL announced a suspension for Metcalf that is set to heavily impact the Steelers' final playoff push.\n\nHere's what to know about Metcalf's suspension after the Steelers star was seen hitting a Lions fan in Week 16.\n\nWhat to know about DK Metcalf getting physical with a spectator\n\nMeet Ryan Kennedy, the fan that DK Metcalf threw a punch at during Lions-Steelers game\n\nOn Monday, Tom Pelissero reported that the NFL is suspending Metcalf for two games without pay for his physical confrontation with a Lions fan. Metcalf appeal that ruling, but on Tuesday, the two-game suspension was upheld, per Adam Schefter.\n\nThe NFL's statement on the suspension called it \"conduct detrimental to the NFL,\" saying that \"Metcalf's actions violate league policy, which specifies that 'players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day.\"\n\nFrom the NFL on DK Metcalf being suspended two games for his physical confrontation with a fan Sunday. pic.twitter.com/zopnwRAI0A\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) December 22, 2025\n\nSome level of punishment was expected for Metcalf after Sunday's incident.\n\nMetcalf was not disciplined by the officials for his interaction with a Lions fan on the sideline. However, that was because the referees did not see the interaction.\n\nHe appeared to be the one who initiated the physical contact with the fan, which means his situation is unlike that of Lamar Jackson's earlier in 2025, when the Baltimore Ravens quarterback pushed a Bills fan who had slapped his teammate's helmet. In that instance, the NFL did not punish Jackson, as the fan was banned from NFL stadiums and the matter was \"addressed by the club,\" per ESPN.\n\nWhen a player initiates the physical interaction with a fan, it's typically a different story for the league. Metcalf is now set to miss the Steelers' final two regular-season games; he will also be missing out on $277,777 per game check, per Jonathan Jones.\n\nMORE:What to know about the NFL's personal conduct policy\n\nMetcalf will be eligible to return to the Steelers roster on Monday, Jan. 5, after Week 18 is over.\n\nThat means he will miss Pittburgh's final two games of the regular season against the Browns and Ravens.\n\nHere's the moment Metcalf was seen hitting a Lions fan in Sunday's game.\n\nCBS reporter Tracy Wolfson said the fan said something to Metcalf before he swiped at him.\n\nPer ESPN, the Detroit Free Press spoke to the fan in the altercation, and he identified himself as Ryan Kennedy from Pinckney, Michigan. He said he called Metcalf by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.\n\n\"I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,\" Kennedy told the Free Press, per ESPN. \"I'm a little shocked.

Kennedy said that the incident occurred because he called Metcalf by his full name, and the Steelers receiver did not like that.\n\n\"He doesn’t like his government name.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Detroit Lions in Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season, but it wasn't without controversy.\n\nIn the first half, a clip went viral on social media of Pittsburgh wide receiver DK Metcalf appearing to punch a Lions fan in the stands. It was a quick clip, and no context was provided for the interaction at the time, but the video itself looked bad for the pass-catcher.\n\nMetcalf finished out the game because, by the current rule, the NFL can't intervene in a possible player disqualification unless there is a flag. Since the Steelers' offense wasn't even on the field, there were no flags, as the referees weren't even aware it had happened. He was, however, suspended two games by the league, a ruling that was then upheld after an appeal.\n\nWhile the public may never know exactly what happened to cause Metcalf to react that way, he may have a history with the fan.\n\nHere is more on the Lions fan that Metcalf punched in Week 16.\n\nMORE: DK Metcalf throws punch at fan during Lions-Steelers game\n\nThe Lions fan whom Metcalf punched is named Ryan Kennedy.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press was able to track him down after the game for his side of the story.

I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt. I’m a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me.

Kennedy told the Detroit Free Press after the game that he called the wide receiver by his legal name, causing the outburst.\n\nSources told NFL Network's Tom Pelissero that Kennedy and Metcalf have history. Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy last year when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and he reported the fan to stadium security.\n\nChad Ochocino said on a live stream appearance with Shannon Sharpe that sources told him that the fan called Metcalf a racial slur, and then made derogatory comments about the player's mother, but none of these claims have been confirmed.\n\nMetcalf's real name is DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, but he prefers to go by DK.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture in Week 16\n\nAfter the claims from Ochocinco that Kennedy used racial or derogatory language against Metcalf, the Lions fan, via his lawyer, released a statement denying that report.\n\nThe statement reads, \"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game.

    "description": "Cleveland Browns QB Shedeur Sanders has shown development but the 2026 NFL draft could bring Dante Moore, Fernando Mendoza",
    "fullText": "In sports, in general, in 2025, there is no room for nuance. We know there is here at DBN in our comment section and in The Feed, but the general sports world speaks in certainties that really don’t exist and cliché sayings (both old and new) that lack detail.\n\nDuring the Cleveland Browns’ Week 16 game against the Buffalo Bills, I was reminded of a few of those certainties and clichés. For example, many have buried QB Shedeur Sanders as having no chance of being a top-level starter in the NFL, while others have looked at the exact same performances and seen enough to know for sure the Browns should build around their fifth-round quarterback.\n\nThe cliche “if it hits your hands, you should catch it” came up after Sanders’ first interception. In my analysis, Sanders’ throw was behind and thrown too hard for RB Quinshon Judkins to be able to haul it in easily. A great receiver may have been able to make the catch, but assuming Cleveland’s running back should have caught it was too far for what I saw. For others:\n\nEh make a play.\n\nThat definitely wasn’t too hard. Definitely was too behind…but also catch the ball.\n\n— Michael Keefe (@GarageBeersMike) December 21, 2025\n\nFor what it is worth, Michael Keefe is a friend of mine who understands football and has an amazing sports voice (literal voice); we just disagree here. I’ll forever argue in the nuance, especially when most others are only arguing on the extremes and in clichés.\n\nWhich brings us back to Sanders’ future:\n\n“Shedeur deserves more time to develop with a better OL and better weapons”.’\n\nAnd \n\n“You can’t pass on Mendoza or Moore in the Top 3 if one is there”\n\nCan both be true, IMO #DawgPound\n\n— CLEology (@_CLEology) December 22, 2025\n\nYes, Clay (another sports friend of mine), both can be true.\n\nJason Lloyd of The Athletic pointed out what the raw data has told us about both Dillon Gabriel and Sanders:\n\nGabriel has a higher Expected Points Added per dropback than Sanders — although that isn’t really saying much since Gabriel and Sanders have the two lowest figures in the league this season. Sanders has thrown for more yards and is averaging more yards per attempt, but Gabriel has a higher completion percentage, a higher passer rating and a higher touchdown-to-interception ratio.\n\nThe big difference, as you turn to the film that has led to that data, is that Sanders’ play looks like a rookie quarterback who is making big mistakes, but is also growing and developing. Whether it is the deep throws to Isaiah Bond, the feathered throws to Harold Fannin Jr., the successful scrambles at key moments, or his improved (still shaky) pocket presence, Sanders has shown that he could develop into a starter in the NFL…\n\n… but the Browns are going to have a top pick in the 2026 NFL draft to select a quarterback, Dante Moore or Fernando Mendoza, that they’ll likely have a much higher prospect grade on.\n\nIf Cleveland doesn’t have a high grade on Moore, Mendoza, or another quarterback, they would look to build around Sanders, even if they trade down to hedge their bets for a QB in the 2027 NFL draft. If the Browns didn’t have a pick where they could select one of the top quarterbacks (something Sanders could still impact in the last two weeks of the season), the team would continue to develop Sanders with an improved group of players around him and veteran QB Deshaun Watson supporting him as his backup.\n\nBarring a win or two, Cleveland will be selecting at the top of the upcoming draft and, most likely, picking a quarterback.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Sanders doesn’t have a role with the Browns. As is true with all rookie quarterbacks, I’m always in the “sit them until they are ready, plus a game or two” camp of development. Sanders could have all of training camp and the start of the 2026 NFL season to prove he is a capable starter in the NFL. Auditioning for Cleveland and every other team in the NFL while Moore, Mendoza, or whoever sits and waits.\n\nEven if Sanders is the backup, the young QB will have all of camp and preseason to audition for a starting job on other teams. This season has shown (with undrafted rookies starting in multiple places) the dire need for quality quarterback play around the league. If Sanders is able to show his development, even if designated as a backup, he’ll have a chance to start for another team in the very near future, and the team would get a quality return if their fifth-round pick proves he is a starting-caliber QB.\n\nThe Browns have gone decades with just one starting-level quarterback (Baker Mayfield) on their roster. In 2026, there could be two in Cleveland if the Browns select a quarterback high in this year’s draft and Sanders continues to develop. If that happens, whoever is in charge of the front office will have a difficult decision to make. A great problem to have.\n\nShedeur Sanders has shown signs that he could develop into a starting-level quarterback, and the Cleveland Browns are likely to draft a quarterback high in the 2026 NFL draft. Both are true, and Sanders’ role with the Browns will continue in 2026.",

Since then, the family has helped him manage the condition.\n\n“What we’ve learned through our experience is that these kids are warriors,” Philip Rivers told PEOPLE. “We have seen firsthand the tremendous responsibility it is for these children to have the discipline to manage the disease with the support of family, and their health providers to live their best lives.”\n\nPhilip and Tiffany sold custom products through Tiffany's swimwear brand, Hermoza, to raise money for diabetes foundations in 2019.\n\nLike his father, Gunner became the starting quarterback at his high school, St. Michael Catholic in Alabama, as a freshman. Philip has coached the team led by his son, saying in 2023 that he doesn't have a desire to coach any higher than high school.\n\n“I think I would have gone right into it had that been what I wanted to do,” Philip Rivers told AL.com. “But, really, I’ve longed to coach my boys and these other 15-18 year-old boys since I was 25. I’m good right here.”\n\nPer AL.com, with Gunner as his starting quarterback, Philip Rivers led St. Michael Catholic to the playoffs in 2023 for the first time in school history. As of 2025, Gunner was a junior and beginning to eye college recruiting, with Philip Rivers telling AL.com that the family was keeping up with college football more because of it.\n\n247Sports has rated Gunner as a four-star quarterback prospect in the class of 2027, listing offers from Auburn, Miami, Boston College and more. And naturally, 247Sports scouting director Andrew Ivins compared Gunner's play style to his father's.\n\n\"Modern pocket passer with elite pedigree that wins with touch, timing and sound decision-making. Owns more of a unique shot put-like release, but makes it work, much like dad did many moons ago,\" Ivins wrote of Gunner Rivers. \"Projects at this stage as a high-end distributor with a rare set of intangibles that has a chance to be a difference-maker at the game’s highest level.\"\n\nAs for Peter Rivers, born in 2011, his father described him as an \"old soul\" to the Indianapolis Star in 2020. Peter also loves sports, his father said.\n\n“He kind of reminds me of a little slot receiver,” Philip Rivers said of Peter, per IndyStar. “Kind of like a Wes Welker.”\n\nThe youngest son is Andrew, who was born in October 2023. He was the Rivers' 10th child.\n\n“It’s awesome. Tiffany is awesome,” Philip Rivers told AL.com when Andrew was born. “It doesn’t matter if it’s the first child or the 10th child. It’s an awesome miracle every time. Everyone is home now, and everyone is good.”\n\nPhilip and Tiffany Rivers have seven daughters. The oldest is Halle, who was born in July 2002 — around two years before Philip reached the NFL, while he still was playing football at NC State. Tiffany also went to NC State.\n\nPer People, Halle previously said that she's used to the public interest that comes with having a quarterback father.\n\n\"He's been famous since before I was born,\" Halle said, per People. \"It's just been normal kind of my whole life. ... He's an NFL quarterback; he's doing a million different things every day, but every day he comes home, and he wants to be with us. If he has one extra minute that he could do something else, he'll be with us.\"\n\nIn 2020, Philip Rivers told the Indianapolis Star that Halle reminds him of his wife.\n\n“She reminds me, big-time, of her mom, which is a big compliment,” Rivers said, per the Indianapolis Star. “The biggest compliment I can probably give.”\n\nAs of 2025, Halle Rivers has a child of her own, making Philip and Tiffany grandparents. Philip announced in May 2025 that he had a new grandson.\n\nCaroline Rivers was the couple's second child, born in 2005, when Philip was beginning his Chargers career.\n\n“Caroline is very strong-willed, and I say that as a huge compliment,” Rivers said of Caroline in 2020. “She’s kind of a go-getter in that regard.”\n\nGrace Rivers, born in 2006, was nicknamed \"Combo\" by her parents at a young age, per the Indianapolis Star, for being like a blend of her mother and her father. She played both tennis and basketball.\n\n“She goes with the flow,” Philip Rivers said of Grace.\n\nBorn in 2010, Sarah Rivers was the couple's fourth daughter. Philip said in 2020 that Grace had gotten into swimming as she tried to find a sport she enjoyed.\n\n“Sarah’s got a big personality, loves to talk,” Philip Rivers said. “She is chatty, and I say that in a good way.”\n\nIn 2013, Philip and Tiffany welcomed their seventh child, Rebecca Rivers, and in 2015, Clare Rivers was their eighth child. Philip called Rebecca \"strong-willed\" to the Indianapolis Star in 2020; he also shared that Clare was born exactly two years after Rebecca, so they share a birthday.\n\n“They use the term they’re 'birthday sisters',” Philip Rivers said. “They enjoy having the same birthday right now. I don’t know if it will be the same when they’re 12 or 14.”\n\nAnna Rivers is the couple's youngest daughter. She was born in March 2019, with the Chargers' social media accounts announcing her birth.\n\nSHE'S HERE.\n\nWelcome to the world, Anna Rivers 👶 https://t.co/oafdNNI6lI\n\n— Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) March 26, 2019\n\nBefore Anna was born, Tiffany told WWD that the arrival of their seventh daughter would be a generational experience for the Rivers family.\n\n“This is the third generation in Philip’s family, who has seven girls and two boys so we were pretty excited about that,\" she said. \"When we told his 91-year-old grandfather, he said, ‘You didn’t have to go to the doctor to find that out. I could have told you — that’s family history.’ ”\n\nPhilip Rivers has one known grandson, as his oldest daughter, Halle, welcomed a son. In a video shared by Jon Gruden in May 2025, Philip shared that he had become a grandfather.\n\nMORE:Meet Justin Herbert's full family\n\nPhilip Rivers' wife is Tiffany Rivers. The two met in middle school in Alabama, then began dating in high school before attending North Carolina State University together then getting married in 2001 during their freshman year of college. Since then, Philip and Tiffany have welcomed 10 children.\n\nPhilip told The Chastity Project that he remembered first seeing Tiffany when he was young.\n\n“With Tiffany, I remember pointing her out at a ballgame at the ball field when I was young,” he said. “But I remember telling my mom, ‘Hey Mom, see that girl over there, she’s a good girl.’ And she was centered on faith and Christ. She had those values that I was looking for.”\n\nPhilip also said that while he grew up in the Catholic Church, his wife converted and became a Catholic the day before their wedding.\n\n“My wife had a lot to do with it, she’s a convert and she actually became Catholic the day before we got married,\" Philip told Life Teen, per The Christian Post. \"There’s so many gifts from the Faith to appreciate and it strikes people differently, but the one-ness of the Church wherever you are, Raleigh, San Diego, Alabama. Every place we were was home because the Catholic Church is the same everywhere.\"\n\nPhilip and Tiffany welcomed their first daughter, Halle, while they were in school at NC State in 2002. Philip was the starting quarterback for the Wolfpack, while Tiffany \"had a job working with children,\" per People.\n\nIn 2019, Philip spoke about how \"steady\" Tiffany has been as a mother and wife for their family.\n\n\"\"Our family wouldn't be what it is without her. She provides a great steadiness for all of us,\" he said. \"She's great for me also from a football standpoint as far as balancing my energy and passion I have for football. And she's the same with our family.\"\n\nThrough all the ups and downs that comes with football, and all the commitments that I obviously have, I can't imagine doing this without her. There's no way I could do it without her.\"\n\nTiffany co-founded a swimwear line called Hermoza alongside Marisa De Lecce. She also worked with Philip in 2009 to create the Rivers of Hope Foundation, which helped orphaned and foster children find homes. The nonprofit raised over $1 million until its closure in 2013.\n\n\"Tiffany and I are honored to be involved in bringing hope and awareness to the plight of foster children in San Diego County. But now we want to broaden our focus and take a behind-the-scenes approach to helping children,\" Philip said in a statement at the time, per CBS 8. \"Tiffany and I have seen great things happen in the last four years with the public foundation, and now we want to expand our personal efforts for these purposes. It takes us out of the public eye and puts the kids center-stage.”\n\nMORE: Anthony Richardson's full family tree\n\nIn December 2025, when Rivers was playing his second game since un-retiring for the Colts, his entire family was in attendance to watch him take on the San Francisco 49ers.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are one of the NFL's most successful franchises, but they've also been one of the unluckiest.\n\nSan Francisco's 2025 NFL season has continued an alarming trend of years in which the roster was greatly impacted by injuries. Quarterback Brock Purdy and tight end George Kittle went down with injuries in Week 1, causing each to miss time before the franchise returned to the Bay for its home opener.\n\nOther key players to miss time include wide receivers Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings, while star linebacker Fred Warner was carted off the field in Week 6.\n\nHere is a closer look at the 49ers' injuries, how the team has been impacted in comparison to other NFL franchises and a year-by-year timeline of absences to key players.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 18 greatest 49ers players ever\n\nThe 49ers have been one of the NFL's most injured teams for several years running.\n\nSan Francisco has been a top-10 most-injured team in six of seven seasons between 2018 and 2024, with the lone exception being the 2023 season.

WR Brandon Aiyuk and S Malik Mustapha both began the 2025 season on the PUP list with serious knee injuries, and they were joined on the sidelines by other key players along the way.\n\nQB Brock Purdy and TE George Kittle both sustained injuries in Week 1, with Purdy missing multiple games and Kittle being placed on IR. In Week 3, DE Nick Bosa suffered a season-ending torn ACL. Two key wide receivers, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall, also missed multiple games early in the season, and Pearsall's absences lingered into the final few weeks of the season.\n\nIn Week 6, veteran linebacker Fred Warner had to be carted off the field in an air cast in a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He will miss the remainder of the season with a broken and dislocated right ankle.\n\nIn the same week, after the loss, wide receiver Jauan Jennings told the media that he is playing with not only broken ribs, but also both high and low ankle sprains.\n\nIn Week 16, Kittle also exited with an ankle injury, not long after San Francisco had already secured a playoff berth.\n\nMORE:George Kittle plans to leave NFL for WWE when 'it hurts to put pants on in the morning'\n\nRB Christian McCaffery: 13 games missed\n\nWR Brandon Aiyuk: 10 games missed\n\nP Mitch Wishnowsky: 8 games missed\n\nOT Trent Williams: 6 games misssed\n\nRB Jordan Mason: 5 games missed\n\nRunning back Christian McCaffrey's Achilles injury was the cloud that loomed large over the 49ers' season in 2024.

Notably, QB Trey Lance was placed on season-ending IR with an ankle injury and was replaced by Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nGaroppolo suffered an injury in Week 13, paving the way for a rookie Brock Purdy to emerge.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are unlikely to be picking high in the 2026 NFL Draft unless they pull off a surprising trade. Meanwhile, two of their biggest rivals, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets, are expected to be near the top of the draft order.\n\nBoth Miami and New York might be eyeing a rookie quarterback in the first round. Pro Football Focus’s Gordon McGuinness released a mock draft on Monday that had the Dolphins moving up from Pick No. 10 to No. 1 by trading with the New York Giants to secure Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.\n\n“Projected trade: New York Giants send No. 1 overall pick to Miami Dolphins for No. 10, No. 44, a 2027 first-round pick and a 2027 second-round pick,” McGuinness wrote.\n\n“With Tua Tagovailoa benched ahead of the Dolphins’ Week 16 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, it’s obvious that Miami is in the market for a new quarterback. In this mock draft, they get aggressive to move up for one.\n\n“Mendoza recorded a 6.2% big-time throw rate and a 2.3% turnover-worthy play rate this season, which compares well with recent No. 1 overall picks Cam Ward (6.3%, 3.3%) and Caleb Williams (6.2%, 3.6%).”\n\nThe Dolphins will likely be on the lookout for a replacement for Tagovailoa. With the upcoming rookie quarterback draft class not expected to be deep, Miami will need to think outside the box to move up in the draft and find its future signal caller.\n\nWhy Bill Belichick’s Possible Latest Move Signals He Likely Won’t Accept NFL Head Coaching Role This Offseason",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSince he entered the league in 2019, DK Metcalf has been known as one of the NFL's most productive wide receivers -- but also one of its most explosive personalities.\n\nFirst with the Seattle Seahawks, then with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Metcalf has earned a bit of a reputation for off-the-field antics, including the NFL having to discipline him. While Metcalf's dominance on the field has been a sight to behold at times, he's also been a distraction to his team at others.\n\nMetcalf has a long list of fines from the league for incidents ranging from fights and unnecessary roughness penalties, plus a 2025 suspension due to his physical interaction with a Detroit Lions fan.\n\nHere's a full timeline of Metcalf's off-the-field incidents since he entered the NFL.\n\nWhat to know about DK Metcalf getting physical with a spectator\n\nMeet Ryan Kennedy, the fan that DK Metcalf threw a punch at during Lions-Steelers game\n\nMetcalf has picked up 16 career fines from the NFL, per Spotrac, and the first came in December 2020.\n\nMetcalf, as part of a touchdown celebration, jumped into the stands — which were without fans during ongoing COVID-19 protocols — and took the broadcast camera from Fox's camera operator, moved it around a bit, then returned to the field.\n\nThe NFL then fined him $6,131 for that celebration.\n\nLmao DK Metcalf stealing the media camera and using it for his TD celebration. #Seahawkspic.twitter.com/I9mmXWevBi\n\n— Samuel Gold (@SamuelRGold) December 13, 2020\n\nIn a two-week span in October 2021, Metcalf was hit with a pair of NFL fines. First, after a matchup against the Saints, he earned a fine for unsportsmanlike conduct after a few scrums with cornerback Marshon Lattimore. Both players were fined for their roles in the incidents, seen shoving, grabbing at face masks and jawing at each other throughout the night.\n\nThen, on Halloween during the 2021 season, Metcalf was hit with a taunting fine in Week 8 after a Seahawks win over the Jaguars.\n\nMetcalf leaped up and hugged the goal post during a celebration, which he said was a reference to Antonio Brown previously doing the same, but the NFL wound up fining him $6,949 for the antics.\n\nHOW did @dkm14 make this catch 😱😱 😱\n\n📺: #JAXvsSEA on CBS pic.twitter.com/fQYMx6dVSY\n\n— x - Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) October 31, 2021\n\nMetcalf responded to his fine on social media, surprising at how much he was fined for a simple hug of the goal post.\n\nShiiii, Ain’t no hug worth that much bruh https://t.co/d16dwXb6vwpic.twitter.com/15FPHrRKy0\n\n— DeKaylin Metcalf (@dkm14) November 6, 2021\n\nThe 2021 season continued to be a busy one for Metcalf in Week 10, when his emotions boiled over during a 17-0 loss to the Packers. With less than two minutes remaining in the game, the receiver got into a fight with Packers safety Henry Black after grabbing Black's facemask during a scuffle.\n\nMetcalf was ejected for fighting, then also received a $6,949 fine.\n\n#Seahawks WR DK Metcalf has been ejected after this altercation with #Packers DB Henry Black.pic.twitter.com/Ry1jdhIOpd\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) November 15, 2021\n\nPlenty of NFL players debate with officials, pleading their case for the right call, but Metcalf seemed to have taken it too far in November 2022. In Week 10, he was flagged during the Seahawks' matchup against the Buccaneers after arguing an uncalled defensive pass interference penalty in the end zone.\n\nThe NFL proceeded to hit him with a $29,785 fine for arguing with an official, and while Metcalf appealed the fine, it was upheld. Per Adam Schefter, Metcalf was said to asked the official in the game if a play was pass interference, and the official was said to respond, “Did I throw a flag?”\n\nToward the end of the 2022 regular season, Metcalf received two fines from the NFL. The first came following Week 13 against the Rams, as Metcalf heat-butted opposing cornerback Jalen Ramsey and was called for unsportsmanlike conduct, then fined $10,609.\n\n“Yeah, I head-butted him on purpose,” Metcalf said, per the Seattle Times. “The official’s right there. [Ramsey] pushed me, so I head-butted him. It’s football.”\n\nThen, when the Seahawks and Rams met a few weeks later in January, Metcalf was fined another $21,219 for unsportsmanlike conduct in an exchange with Ramsey.\n\nMetcalf's troublemaking against the Rams continued into the 2023 season. In Week 1, Seattle took on L.A., and Metcalf had an ugly series where he blindsided safety Ahkello Witherspoon with a late hit to the ground, which wasn't part of the play.\n\nThat was then followed by a taunting penalty, meaning Metcalf received a pair of fines for a total of $21,854 from the NFL.\n\nFrustrations boiling over for the Seahawks right now 😬\npic.twitter.com/GvF7Kbkdqn\n\n— PFF (@PFF) September 10, 2023\n\nSeahawks head coach Pete Carroll later said Metcalf had to start to \"elevate above\" the antics, as his fines and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties were becoming a theme.\n\n\"DK and I talked for a long time last night about [how] that's not what we can allow to happen because that means that they can control him and get after him,\" Carroll said on his Seattle Sports 710-AM radio show, per ESPN. \"So, he has to elevate above that. So it's a challenge. This is nothing new. DK's been an emotional, feisty, fiery player since the day he got here, and that is who he is. But he has to also manage that so they don't take advantage of it.\"\n\nThe penalties continued for Metcalf in Weeks 2 and 3 of the 2023 season, as he was first flagged for a facemask on safety Kerby Joseph against the Lions, resulting in a fine of $10,927.\n\nThen, in Week 3, Metcalf was fined $16,391 by the NFL for an unnecessary roughness penalty against the Panthers, which resulted from him laying an illegal blindside block on a Carolina defender.\n\nWeek 6 of the 2023 season saw Metcalf get into a spat with Cincinnati Bengals DB Cam Taylor-Britt. The receiver shoved Taylor-Britt to the ground from behind after the whistle, and it resulted in a $16,391 fine for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nWhat a stupid play by DK Metcalf. Glad the ref was right there to see this https://t.co/50Hc0QX4kt\n\n— Kelsey Conway (@KelseyLConway) October 15, 2023\n\nMetcalf found another opposing defender to confront in Week 14 of the 2023 season, getting into it with San Francisco 49ers linebacker Fred Warner. Metcalf slammed Warner to the ground, then as the two began to fight, he grabbed Warner's facemask.\n\nMetcalf was ejected from the game, then fined $19,123 for fighting.\n\nSeahawks WR DK Metcalf has been ejected for this interaction with 49ers LB Fred Warner. pic.twitter.com/NX1SJXvp5n\n\n— Arye Pulli (@AryePulliNFL) December 10, 2023\n\nWhile no penalty was thrown in the game, Metcalf walked away from the Seahawks' matchup against the Giants in October 2024 with more fines to pay.\n\nHe was dinged $11,255 for an uncalled roughness penalty in the game, after he appeared to throw Giants cornerback Deonte Banks to the ground.\n\nDK Metcalf was fined for unnecessary roughness on the big Tyler Lockett catch before halftime against the Giants.\n\nCheck the bottom left of the video at the end of the play. pic.twitter.com/monKTwPCLj\n\n— Mookie Alexander (@mookiealexander) October 12, 2024\n\nFollowing a Seahawks vs. Bears matchup in January 2025, one of Metcalf's final games for Seattle, he was docked $22,511 for a skirmish with Chicago cornerback Tyrique Stevenson.\n\nMetcalf and Stevenson got into it, pushing and shoving a bit, then Metcalf head-butted Stevenson with his helmet, resulting in the fine.\n\nThe NFL fined #Seahawks WR DK Metcalf $22,511 for unnecessary roughness (use of helmet) for head-butting #Bears CB Tyrique Stevenson during their dust-up last week. pic.twitter.com/lZljQR9hXS\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 4, 2025\n\nMetcalf received his first fine as a member of the Steelers in November 2025, hit with a $12,171 charge for unsportsmanlike conduct after an unnecessary roughness flag in the fourth quarter of Pittsburgh’s 35-25 defeat to the Green Bay Packers.\n\nMetcalf engaged in a brief altercation with linebacker Quay Walker, putting his fingers in Walker’s facemask and grabbing it.\n\nThe NFL fined Steelers WR DK Metcalf $12,172 for unsportsmanlike conduct — this run-in with Packers LB Quay Walker last week.\n\npic.twitter.com/b1lwIptFfr\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) November 1, 2025\n\nIn Week 13, after the Steelers took on the Bills, Metcalf was fined $14,491 for unsportsmanlike conduct/obscene gesture.\n\nAfter years and years of fines, Metcalf's actions resulted in a suspension for the first tie in Week 16 of the 2025 season. During the Steelers' matchup against the Detroit Lions, Metcalf was seen swiping at a Lions fan in the stands as he stood on Pittsburgh's sideline at Ford Field.\n\nOfficials did not see the interaction, so he was not penalized in the game, but CBS' broadcast caught Metcalf hitting the Lions fan. The next day, the NFL announced a two-game suspension without pay for Metcalf.\n\nAnother angle of the DK Metcalf incident with a Lions fan has been released....\n\n(via keiffer_kennedy/IG, h/t @premefootball)pic.twitter.com/CwXWQZqAuIhttps://t.co/Ej5KLXFtUz\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 22, 2025\n\nDK Metcalf appears to have an altercation with a Detroit fan pic.twitter.com/a478Zjg3tR\n\n— NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) December 21, 2025\n\nPer ESPN, the Detroit Free Press spoke to the fan who was involved in the altercation, and he identified himself as Ryan Kennedy from Pinckney, Michigan. Kennedy said he called Metcalf by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, which prompted the receiver's physical reaction.\n\n\"I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,\" Kennedy told the Free Press, per ESPN. \"I'm a little shocked. Like everyone's talking to me. I'm a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n\nNFL Network's Tom Pelissero also reported that Kennedy and Metcalf had a history, as Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy in 2024 when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and had previously reported the fan to security.\n\nAfter rumors over whether or not Kennedy used hateful language in the incident, the Lions fan released a statement denying that he used any racial or derogatory language to Metcalf in the interaction through his lawyer.\n\n\"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game. These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nRyan Kennedy, the fan involved in the DK Metcalf altercation Sunday, has issued a statement through an attorney “categorically denying using the “N-word,” the “C-word,” or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident.\n\n“These allegations are completely false.” pic.twitter.com/pQUbBYa0ww\n\n— Brooke Pryor (@bepryor) December 22, 2025\n\nMORE: Ranking the best players in Steelers history",

Delane is the draft’s best cornerback, and his elite instincts and route anticipation enable him to thrive in both man and zone coverages. The 6' 0\", 190-pound Delane has above-average ball skills, with two interceptions and 11 pass breakups this season, and is a physical, willing tackler in run support. He’s the complete package and should start as a rookie.\n\nDelane was a unanimous All-American and First-Team All-SEC in 2025. He recorded 45 tackles and two interceptions this season and just recently officially declared for the draft.\n\nThe Bengals have DJ Turner and Dax Hill as long-term options.

    "description": "At 8-6, the Colts are on the outside looking in at the playoff picture, but 44-year-old Philip Rivers coming in off the couch is one of the great stories of this NFL season.",
    "fullText": "Just think, for a moment, how you’d look in a pair of form-fitting football pants and a tight-around-the-belly jersey. Would you look like a honed specimen of humanity, lean and taut and ready to explode? Or would you look like 10 pounds of sausage in a five-pound casing, busting the seams?\n\nIf you’re being honest, you, me, and pretty much everyone both of us knows would look a whole lot more like a sausage than a specimen. A whole lot like Philip Rivers does, honestly.\n\nBut the difference between Philip Rivers and us, of course, is that we aren’t starting at quarterback on Monday Night Football.\n\nRivers and the briefly-mighty, now-floundering Indianapolis Colts take on the San Francisco 49ers in a matchup that, from a sheer talent standpoint, looked a whole lot more attractive back in September than it does now. Ball-knowers will scoff at Rivers and wonder who in the world would want to watch a 44-year-old grandfather run around for three hours.\n\nTo which I would say: Everyone. Everyone would love to see that. Because what Rivers is doing is both awesome and ridiculous.\n\nIn any other career, Rivers would be hitting his prime at age 44, old enough to have learned the ropes but young enough to have the energy and desire to do more. In sports, though, he’s impossibly ancient, a relic who could burst into a pile of dust with one good sack. Hopefully he won’t, but that’s the line on most aged pro athletes.\n\nPlayers like Tom Brady and LeBron James have redefined the possible parameters of a late-career athlete, but then again, Tom Brady and LeBron James are arguably the GOATs of their respective sports. They played for such a high level for so long that their age-related decline merely brought them down to star level.\n\nRivers wasn’t ever in that stratosphere, though he had a few years in the mid-2000s — you know, about two decades ago — when he garnered some Pro Bowl nods and MVP votes. He ran with all the speed of the changing seasons, yes, but he also possessed two valuable attributes — an orbital-launch arm and a surpassing knowledge of potential defensive schemes.\n\nThat’s how he was able to come back and mesh with the Colts so quickly last week against Seattle. He played within himself, tossing a nifty 18 of 27 completions for 160 yards, with a long of just 17 yards. He had an adjusted yards gained per pass attempt of 3.52 — quite the falloff from the 8- to 9-yard average of his best days. Against San Francisco, he could fare even better; the 49ers trail Seattle in every major defensive category.\n\nBut stats are for nerds. What Grandpa Rivers did last week was ball, plain and simple. And now he’s getting a chance to take Indy on a last-ditch playoff run? Come on, how can you not love this?\n\nAt 8-6, Indianapolis sits in the dreaded first-team-out spot, well behind 10-5 division rival Houston for the final spot in the AFC playoffs. After this week, the Colts have games against the Texans and Jaguars, both teams they’re staring up at in the playoff bracket. The Athletic gives Indianapolis just a 3 percent chance of making the playoffs, which is a rough prognosis given the Colts’ 7-1 start to 2025.\n\nThat’s tough news for the franchise and the city, but on a micro level, a great story is unfolding. Rivers is the embodiment of every former football player — whether high school, college or just two-hand touch Turkey Bowl — who would love to get one more turn in the arena, one more play with the ball in their hands, one more chance to rear back and throw it deep. He’s living the dream that if you keep in shape, if you keep your edge — if not your waistline — then maybe, just maybe, they’ll call your number one more time. Father Time is undefeated, yes, but you can always move the ball against him if you want it badly enough.\n\nRivers’ return is a hell of a story, however it ends. But it’d be nice if he went out with at least one more victory. Why not a prime-time one?",

    "description": "Week 16 reshaped the NFL playoff picture. Here is where things stand ahead of Colts-49ers",
    "fullText": "Week 16 saw several teams clinch playoff spots, and changed the pecking order in both the NFC and the AFC.\n\nIn the NFC, we have a new team in the No. 1 spot, and just two playoff spots left up for grabs as five teams have now clinched.\n\nIn the AFC, the race for the No. 1 spot remains tight, as six teams remain alive in the chase for the bye week.\n\nHere is the full state of play in the NFC ahead of Monday Night Football:\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (10-5) – xy\n\nWashington Commanders (4-11) – e\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ny – Team has clinched their division\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nThanks to Sunday’s action, only two playoff spots are left up for grabs in the NFC.\n\nLet’s start at the top of the conference. Seattle’s huge overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams not only punched the Seahawks’ ticket for the playoffs, but it put them in the driver’s seat for the No. 1 seed in the conference. Seattle now controls their destiny in the chase for the top spot, as wins in their final two games (over Carolina and San Francisco) would give them the No. 1 seed.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles became the first team to clinch their division, as they wrapped up the NFC East with their win over the Washington Commanders on Saturday night. Philadelphia also became the first team to win the NFC East in back-to-back seasons since … the Eagles accomplished that feat back in 2004.\n\nSpeaking of the Panthers, Carolina moved into a playoff spot with their win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. If the postseason began today the Panthers would be in as the No. 4 seed. Tampa Bay’s loss dropped them out of the playoffs, and behind the Minnesota Vikings in the standings. The two teams have matching 7-8 records, but the Vikings have a better conference record.\n\nTampa Bay can still win the division, however, as they play Carolina in Week 18.\n\nChicago’s win over the Packers moved the Bears one step closer to an NFC North title, while putting Green Bay’s playoff chances onto shakier ground. Still, with the Lions losing to the Steelers on Sunday afternoon, the Packers still have some breathing room.\n\nChicago also clinched a playoff spot with the Lions’ loss, as did the 49ers.\n\nHere is what the NFC Wild Card matchups woulkd look like if the playoffs started today:\n\nNo. 7 Green Bay at No. 2 Chicago\n\nNo 6 San Francisco at No. 3 Philadelphia\n\nNo. 5 Los Angeles at No. 4 Carolina\n\nSeattle would have the No. 1 seed and the bye week.\n\nHere is the state of play in the AFC:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nLet’s start at the bottom of the playoff teams. Houston’s win over the Raiders gives the Texans a two-game lead over Indianapolis in the win column, ahead of the Colts’ game tonight against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers and the Buffalo Bills have matching 11-4 records, but the Chargers have a better AFC record (8-2 vs. 8-3) than the Bills, so the Chargers slot into the No. 5 slot while the Bills settle for No. 6. Los Angeles has two more AFC games remaining (Houston and Denver) while the Bills just have the Jets remaining on their list of AFC opponents.\n\nDenver’s loss to Jacksonville, coupled with New England’s win over the Baltimore Ravens, tightened things at the top of the AFC as both teams have matching 12-3 records. The Broncos remain in the top spot due to a better record in common games (6-0 versus 4-1), and Denver has clinched that tiebreaker. However, in addition to the Patriots and Broncos, the Jaguars, Chargers, Bills, and Texans are all alive in the chase for the No. 1 pick.\n\nHere is what the AFC playoffs would look like if they began today, with Denver having the bye week:\n\nNo. 7 Houston at No. 2 New England\n\nNo. 6 Buffalo at No. 3 Jacksonville\n\nNo. 5 Los Angeles at No. 4 Pittsburgh\n\nThere are going to be some new fans around the league rooting for the 49ers tonight.\n\nFirst, let’s start with what this game means for the teams playing on Monday Night Football. The 49ers clinched a playoff spot when the Lions lost to the Steelers, and are now jockeying for position in the NFC pecking order. If the 49ers defeat the Colts, they will improve to 11-4, tying them with the Los Angeles Rams. But the 49ers would move into the No. 5 spot and drop the Rams down to the No. 6 spot, thanks to San Francisco’s better division record. San Francisco is 4-1 in NFC West games, while the Rams are 3-2.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Seahawks are 3-2 in NFC West games as well, and they play San Francisco in Week 18 having already lost to the 49ers back in Week 1.\n\nIf the 49ers lose, they will remain in the No. 6 slot.\n\nAs for the Colts, they enter Monday Night Football on the outside looking in. A win would not move Indianapolis into a playoff spot, but they would close to within one game of the Texans for the No. 7 spot.\n\nBut if the Colts lose, they will be eliminated from AFC South title contention, and they would drop two games behind the Texans in the race for a playoff spot with two games remaining.\n\nIn addition, if the Colts lose, the Chargers, Bills, and Jaguars all clinch playoff spots.",

    "description": "A look at the NFC playoff picture and the Detroit Lions’ dwindling postseason odds and clinching scenarios.",
    "fullText": "With a devastating loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions have dropped to 8-7 on the season, and their playoff hopes are about as realistic as Calvin Johnson coming out of retirement. Here’s a look at what the playoff picture looks like, the Lions’ remaining playoff scenarios, and where the rest of the division and conference looks like.\n\nThe Lions can no longer win the NFC North, and the Bears are just a single win away from clinching their first division title since 2018. It’s a tough pill to swallow for Lions fans, as it appears Ben Johnson was the perfect hire for the Bears.\n\nThe Lions are actually in danger of falling into fourth place in the NFC North, and a loss to the Vikings on Christmas would nearly seal it. Both teams would be 8-8, the Vikings would finish with a season sweep of the Lions, and Detroit would finish the season with a tough matchup against a Bears team that may be still looking to clinch the division.\n\nOf course, maybe it would be a blessing in disguise for the Lions to finish last in the division so that they could play a fourth-place schedule next year (which would like feature games against the Giants, Titans, and Cardinals).\n\nWild Card race (top three advance)\n\nThe Lions’ best potential record is 10-7, meaning they can only mathematically catch the 49ers and Packers. But because the 49ers have locked in the tiebreaker over the Lions due to their conference record (8-2 vs. 5-5), the Packers are the only team Detroit can actually catch.\n\nObviously that would require the Lions to win both of their remaining games (at Vikings, at Bears), but the Packers would also have to lose out. Green Bay has the 7-8 Baltimore Ravens this upcoming week, who lost Lamar Jackson to a back injury on Sunday night. And they finish out with the Vikings, who lost J.J. McCarthy to a throwing hand injury on Sunday. Even though the Packers are struggling and have a bunch of injuries of their own, that seems very unlikely to happen.\n\nThe New York Times only gives the Lions a 6% chance to make the playoffs. NextGenStats has Detroit at 8%.",

    "fullText": "This week, Chiefs Wire's Ed Easton Jr. spoke with WWE Superstar and long-time Chicago Bears fan Seth Rollins.\n\nIn his interview with Easton Jr., Rollins discussed his role as a special guest for NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix on Thursday, December 25th. He will be in attendance for the Detroit Lions at the Minnesota Vikings, providing insight on the NFC North rivals.\n\n\"Well, my hope at that point is that the Bears have locked up a spot in the playoffs, and I don't have to stress. However, they have a hell of a schedule coming up. They got Green Bay and San Francisco, then finished with Detroit,\" said Rollins, \"So for one night only, I will be a Minnesota Vikings fan. Don't tell anybody from Detroit. But yeah, I'm going to be rooting for the Vikings. I'm probably going to need them to take the Lions down a peg so that the Bears can lock in and get it done. But yeah, it should be a fun game.\"\n\nThe streaming service returns on Christmas Day with another NFL global doubleheader, following the Kansas City Chiefs' victory in last year's first-ever broadcast over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nGet ready for some action-packed Christmas magic 🎄 \n\nDallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders at 1 PM ET \nDetroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings at 4:30 PM ET \n\nLIVE on Netflix December 25 pic.twitter.com/pVUKmqtrCM\n\n— Netflix Sports (@netflixsports) December 3, 2025\n\nThe Vikings will rely on 2024 first-round draft pick J.J. McCarthy, who has been inconsistent due to injuries, while the Lions try to regain the dominant form that propelled them last season.\n\n\"Curious to see the progression of J.J. McCarthy and what he looks like in Kevin O'Connell's offense as he goes through sort of what his rookie year is. Obviously, he missed last season with the injury, but it's kind of his first go-around,\" said Rollins, \"Which Lions are we going to get? Lions from last year that dominated and maybe made an early playoff exit, or are we going to get a Lions team that misses the playoffs this season? It's going to be very interesting to see. Looking forward to the matchup, and yeah, I will be saying 'Skol' all afternoon.\"\n\nNetflix's inaugural NFL Christmas games in 2024 smashed streaming records, with the Chiefs vs. Steelers game averaging over 24 million U.S. viewers and reaching nearly 65 million unique viewers across the doubleheader, making it the most-streamed NFL games ever on the platform.\n\nRollins will star in WWE Unreal Season 2, premiering on January 20, 2026: https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-unreal-season-2-release-date-trailer-news.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: WWE Superstar Seth Rollins discusses Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns head into the final two weeks of the 2025 NFL season with a clear chance to clinch one of the first two picks in the 2026 NFL draft. The Browns moved up to the third spot after the early Week 16 games on Sunday, but saw the Las Vegas Raiders fail to knock off the Houston Texans in a very close game that would have helped Cleveland move up even further.\n\nThe Browns close loss to the Buffalo Bills was made much worse by the significant injuries to RB Quinshon Judkins. While there was a positive estimate after the game, Cleveland fans await confirmation on whether Judkins’ ligaments are intact.\n\nWith just one game left in Week 16, the Browns remain locked into the third spot in the 2026 NFL draft order, with the pick they acquired from the Jacksonville Jaguars likely awaiting the results in the NFL playoffs.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (via Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (via Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (via Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (via Jacksonville Jaguars)\n\nThe Giants and Raiders play each other next week, with Las Vegas also set to play the (zombie) Chiefs in Week 18.

It’s been a great experience here today and I don’t know what the future holds for me, but it was a special day for me and my family.”\n\n.@T_Hill4 on the past 9 years in New Orleans and what this city means to him pic.twitter.com/xSyUa2O99c\n\n— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) December 21, 2025\n\nHill restructured his contract last offseason, and there are no contractual ties to keep him in New Orleans beyond 2025. He started the year on the PUP list after having his 2024 campaign cut short by a significant knee injury that included a torn ACL, and it makes sense for a rebuilding Saints team to move in another direction.\n\n“I can tell you, I have so much love for the city of New Orleans and this fan base and the way that they’ve embraced me and my family,” Hill said.\n\n“It’s been really special. I wouldn’t want to play somewhere else, but there’s a lot of circumstances that are out of your control and I understand the nature of this business. I’m not thinking that way right now, but we’ll tackle that when we get there.”\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it.”\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Kellen Moore\n\nNew Orleans first-year coach Kellen Moore, who is Hill’s third head coach in his time with the Saints, shared what Hill has meant to the franchise.\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it,” Moore said. “His ability to play every phase of the offense and contribute on special teams is really special.\n\n“He’s an A-plus person, an A-plus human being and an A-plus player. Our young guys can learn a lot from him.”\n\n#Saints HC Kellen Moore on Taysom Hill:\n\n\"This league talks about trying to get Taysom Hills on your football team ... no one seems to be able to duplicate it.\" pic.twitter.com/JtZkkQWbVr\n\n— NOF (@nofnetwork) December 21, 2025\n\nIn Sunday’s game, Hill delivered an effort that was vintage Swiss Army Knife.\n\nHe led New Orleans in rushing, made plays from his tight end position and even threw a touchdown with under two minutes to play.\n\nThat score was something the Saints acknowledged they were trying to get for Hill, in case he doesn’t return.\n\nWhen he heard the team was trying to get Hill a touchdown, Olave made sure he was on the field at a point in the game when he didn’t need to be in the contest risking injury.\n\n“Definitely wanted to be a part of that, especially knowing they wanted to get Taysom a touchdown, so I wanted to be a part of that — a deep ball, too — so I definitely wanted to be in there,” Olave said.",

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Seahawks edge Patriots for new No. 1; Jaguars, Bears also rise; Packers fade for Week 17 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRanking all 32 teams in the NFL from best to worst for every week in the 2025 regular season has been a wild ride. With such a top-heavy league, the hierarchy can see a big change based on a few particular results.\n\nThat has often caused teams to jump high or fade fast in relation to the others near the top. Even the back end has seen some significant reshuffling of late.\n\nHere's Sporting News' latest breakdown from the tippy top to rock bottom coming out of Week 16:\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture after Week 16 results\n\nThe Seahawks won that thriller over the Rams with the offense rebounding after a slow passing start. They need Sam Darnold to cut down on the mistakes and keep raising the big plays to live up to their lofty playoff position.\n\nThe Patriots went into more of an offensive slump in Baltimore with Drake Maye cooling and being contained again, putting their chances of stealing the AFC East in serious jeopardy.\n\nMORE: Patriots clinch playoff spot for first time since 2021\n\nThe Rams had no problems moving the ball without Davante Adams with Matthew Stafford spreading the ball around and getting more from the running game. But the secondary issues in Seattle became more prevalent when the front cannot get pressure.\n\nThe Broncos couldn't find enough clean offense from Bo Nix to make another fourth-quarter comeback in what looked more like a blowout loss to the Jaguars. Their defense, having key lapses, is a shaky late development.\n\nThe Jaguars had their true statement victory in Denver, making six straight wins. Their road domination and finishing well in the fourth quarter bodes well for their playoff profile.\n\nMORE: 6 reasons why Jaguars are legitimate Super Bowl contenders\n\nThe Bears should be thrilled to have the late-game comeback mode of Caleb Williams, always giving them a chance. Chicago is pushing toward being a tough out in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: Bears take control of NFC North with win over Packers\n\nThe Bills were caught in a tough battle down the road in Cleveland as Josh Allen's clunker against a tough defense was saved by James Cook and the running game. The defense was fortunate to face a team with limited weapons to survive\n\nThe Chargers went into Dallas and used it for a get-well offensive game with more juice from their defense, too. Justin Herbert needed that and so did Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe 49ers should have loved the fact that the Seahawks took down the Rams on Thursday night. Their offense is red-hot and a win over the Colts would give them control of the division in the final two weeks.\n\nThe Eagles have got their offensive groove back with Saquon Barkley running well and Jalen Hurts' passing efficiently everywhere to silence the critics. They don't need to worry about the division anymore and can focus on getting into top shape for their Super Bowl defense in the playoffs.\n\nThe Packers saw Jordan Love get concussed in Chicago with Malik Willis playing well enough to win, but had too many offensive, defensive and special teams lapses to create a bigger mess than injuries.\n\nThe Texans were able to hold off the Raiders with resilient offense and just enough of their trademark defense. The hiccup is excusable with a win, but much must be fixed before facing the Chargers next week.\n\nMORE: Texans keep playoff hopes alive by escaping with win over Raiders\n\nThe Steelers found their running game again in Detroit to balance out the stellar run defense. They keep getting better at the right time to get into the playoffs on an uptick with Aaron Rodgers.\n\nThe Lions have been struggling to run the ball at will like they did last season and taking that element away, as the Steelers did. That and an injury-depleted defense have been the downfall for Detroit as a playoff contender.\n\nThe Panthers showed a lot of moxie in outlasting the Buccaneers with Bryce Young winning the biggest passing duel of his career. They have a great shot at making some noise should they get into the NFC playoffs.\n\nMORE: Panthers take control of NFC South with massive win over Buccaneers\n\nThe Colts will try to do more with a game Philip Rivers on Monday night against the 49ers with their season on the line, but the defense also may not oblige in a tough spot.\n\nThe Ravens had another defensive meltdown and other fourth-quarter big mistakes to blow another big lead, this time vs. the Patriots, spelling doom for a bad overall season, now maybe with Lamar Jackson not finishing healthy.\n\nMORE: Ravens' path to the postseason gets bleaker with loss to Patriots\n\nThe Buccaneers are making too many mistakes late in games, from the defense to Baker Mayfield. They can still get into the playoffs but there will be less inspiration for them to last long against a tough wild-card draw.\n\nThe Vikings can't seem to keep J.J. McCarthy healthy right when he builds positive momentum, but they still grounded out another win with enough clutch plays and more needed tough defense against what was a promising Giants offense.\n\nThe Cowboys look like they're running out of gas offensively to keep trying to make up for historically horrible all-around defense. This disappointment can't be blamed on Dak Prescott.\n\nThe Falcons are working to finish strong with wins over the Buccaneers and Cardinals making them feel better about the future of Raheem Morris as head coach. Credit Morris for getting them to be inspired with nothing left on the line.\n\nThe Chiefs can't be expected to win with their defense not having a pass rush and their offense not having a passing game minus Patrick Mahomes, Gardner Minshew and their top wide receiver. The fact they lost so easily on the road to the Titans is just so shocking.\n\nMORE: How Travis Kelce's retirement decision is easy with no Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe Saints took care of the lesser Jets at home with Tyler Shough chucking well with help from diverse weapons under Kellen Moore. He should go into Year 2 as the starting QB and the defense is also playing with a lot of late conviction.\n\nThe Bengals showed almost no life in Week 15 against the Ravens but got up off the mat to rip an overmatched and lesser-motivated Dolphins team with Joe Burrow needing that get-well performance late to try to end the season on a positive.\n\nThe Dolphins have faded fast from their rally back into playoff contention with dismal performances against the Steelers and Bengals in consecutive losses. Mike McDaniel can feel the heat again with the Tua Tagovailoa benching backfiring.\n\nThe Commanders just haven't fielded enough reliable defense all season long, with their age and youth showing in all the wrong places. They will just hope everything will change again with a healthy Jayden Daniels leading the offense.\n\nThe Titans are seeing a much-improved Cam Ward in recent weeks and it added up to a nice confidence-building win against the reeling Chiefs at home.\n\nThe Browns fought hard against the Bills with Shedeur Sanders showing the kind of fight and play that gets him a full-season audition as the starter in 2026 despite the defense falling apart around Myles Garrett.\n\nMORE: Myles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record with obscure half sack\n\nThe Cardinals' positive offensive vibes have hit a wall with Jacoby Brissett and the rest of their backups, who have had too much pressure to compensate for a Jonathan Gannon potential lame-duck defense.\n\nThe Jets did their best to stay competitive with Brady Cook starting again at quarterback but the bigger problem is Aaron Glenn's shell of an overall defense. They are a really lost, bad team.\n\nMORE: Updated NFL draft order after Week 16\n\nJaxson Dart was due for a clunker and the Vikings' defense delivered it to him. The lumps have been there enough to go forward with a new coaching system all-around.\n\nThe Raiders showed more life with their offense in of all places, Houston against the Texans' nasty defense. They also played their most inspired defensive game in weeks. It still wasn't enough to overcome their lack of execution.",

    "description": "A look at the Patriots’ game day roster for their Week 16 game on Sunday night.",
    "fullText": "With Robert Spillane sidelined throughout the game, the New England Patriots’ linebacker group had a disappointing outing last week versus the Buffalo Bills. The challenge will not be any easier for the position on Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nNot only will Spillane miss a second straight game because of an ankle injury, the Ravens feature one of the best run games in the NFL. Led by the two-headed monster of quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry, they are entering Sunday as the league leaders in yards per carry (5.2).\n\nWith Spillane out, that means the task on stopping this potent an attack will fall on replacement starting duo Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. As head coach Mike Vrabel pointed out on Friday, however, they will not be the only one in the spotlight.\n\n“Everybody that goes to the game is going to play and have a role, and we ask everybody to prepare as starters,” Vrabel explained. “That’s something that’s important. And so, Gibby will start in there, and then different guys will play, packages and everything else.”\n\nNew England’s full game day roster against the Ravens looks as follows:\n\nQuarterback (2): Drake Maye (10), Joshua Dobbs (11)\n\nRunning back (4): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), D’Ernest Johnson (34), Jack Westover (37 | FB/TE)\n\nWide receiver (5): Kayshon Boutte (9), Stefon Diggs (8), Mack Hollins (13), DeMario Douglas (3), Kyle Williams (18 | KR)\n\nTight end (2): Hunter Henry (85), Austin Hooper (81)\n\nOffensive tackle (3): Vederian Lowe (59 | LT), Morgan Moses (76 | RT), Thayer Munford Jr. (74)\n\nInterior offensive line (5): Jared Wilson (58 | LG), Garrett Bradbury (65 | C), Mike Onwenu (71 | RG), Ben Brown (77), Caedan Wallace (70)\n\nInterior defensive line (5): Christian Barmore (90), Khyiris Tonga (95 | FB), Cory Durden (94), Eric Gregory (55), Joshua Farmer (92)\n\nDefensive edge (5): Harold Landry III (2), K’Lavon Chaisson (44), Elijah Ponder (91), Anfernee Jennings (33), Bradyn Swinson (43)\n\nLinebacker (5): Jack Gibbens (51), Christian Elliss (53), Jahlani Tavai (48), Marte Mapu (15), Chad Muma (49)\n\nCornerback (5): Christian Gonzalez (0), Carlton Davis III (7), Marcus Jones (25 | PR), Charles Woods (22), Miles Battle (35)\n\nSafety (4): Jaylinn Hawkins (21), Craig Woodson (31), Dell Pettus (24), Brenden Schooler (41)\n\nSpecialists (3): Andy Borregales (36 | K), Bryce Baringer (17 | P/H), Julian Ashby (47 | LS)\n\nThe Patriots’ front seven is seeing some changes compared to last week. Not only is Chad Muma active as extra depth at linebacker and on special teams just five days after getting claimed off waivers from the Indianapolis Colts, two recent inactives are also up this week: Eric Gregory will provide additional depth at defensive tackle, while Bradyn Swinson should help on the edge.\n\nSwinson’s presence on the game day roster comes in light of starter Harold Landry being questionable with a knee injury. The fifth-round rookie has appeared in one game so far, playing 10 snaps in the kicking game but none on defense.\n\nInactives (5): QB3 Tommy DeVito (16), WR Efton Chism III (86), TE C.J. Dippre (82), OT Marcus Bryant (52), LB Robert Spillane (14)\n\nPractice squad (16): RB Jashaun Corbin (30), WR John Jiles (83), WR Jeremiah Webb (29), OL Sebastian Gutierrez (72), OL Andrew Rupcich (67), OL Brenden Jaimes (61), OL Mehki Butler (63), DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (98), DT Leonard Taylor III (93), DT Fabien Lovett Sr. (96), LB Amari Gainer (45), LB Otis Reese (54), CB Brandon Crossley (46), CB Kobee Minor (19), S Richie Grant (39), S John Saunders Jr. (23)\n\nPractice squad/exempt (1): TE Thomas Odukoya (88 | IPPP)\n\nPractice squad/injured (2): RB Craig Reynolds, LB Darius Harris\n\nReserve/injured (11): FB Brock Lampe, OT Yasir Durant, CB Marcellas Dial Jr., DT Jaquelin Roy, RB Lan Larison, RB Deneric Prince, DT Isaiah Iton, RB Antonio Gibson, DT Milton Williams, CB Alex Austin, OT Will Campbell, RB Terrell Jennings\n\nReserve/retired (1): OL Wes Schweitzer\n\nWith no players elevated from the practice squad, a total of five players were ruled out on Sunday. The list includes no surprises, with Spillane, who was deemed inactive ahead of the weekend already, as the only noteworthy absence.\n\nThe Patriots’ game against the Ravens will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.",

    "fullText": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers rookie safety Lathan Ransom has experienced the dramatic highs and lows of playing in the NFL in his first season.\n\nOne week after a crucial penalty that led to a costly loss to the New Orleans Saints, Ransom redeemed himself on Sunday by intercepting Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left to seal the Panthers' 23-20 win over the Buccaneers — allowing Carolina to vault into sole possession of first place in the NFC South.\n\n“I faced a lot of adversity, and I heard noise from everybody last week,” Ransom said. “... (But) that’s how you shake back.”\n\nRansom couldn't have felt much worse last week on the flight home from New Orleans after he was flagged for hitting sliding Saints quarterback Tyler Shough with 9 seconds left on a bang-bang play. Officials flagged Ransom for unnecessary roughness, and the 15-yard penalty turned a difficult 61-yard field goal attempt into a far more makable one from 46 yards.\n\nCharlie Smyth put it through the uprights to complete the Saints' 20-17 come-from-behind win.\n\nHad the Panthers defeated the Saints, they would have only needed to beat the Bucs on Sunday to clinch the NFC South and end a seven-year playoff drought. Instead, the loss left the Panthers on the outside of the playoff bubble.\n\nRansom said he was hard on himself.\n\nBut the fourth-draft pick from Ohio State decided early last week that instead of dwelling on the mistake he'd use it as motivation.\n\n“I understand that the game is not won or lost by one play, but people behind their phone are going to have their own opinions,” Ransom said. “I just heard all the noise — listened to it and used it as fuel for this game.”\n\nRansom leaned on the support last week of veteran defensive leaders such as Jaycee Horn, Derrick Brown and Mike Jackson, who shares the locker next to him.\n\nJackson and others advised to look ahead, not back and keeping playing at full speed.\n\n“He responded like a grown man should,\" Jackson said. “At the end of day, everyone was talking trash to him, like he shouldn't be in the game and this and that. And today he responded like he should be. I'll just say I'm proud of him. Because at the end of the day it's grown man football and he showed that.”\n\nPanthers coach Dave Canales greeted Ransom on the sideline with a huge hug after interception, and smiled as he spoke about the rookie after the game.\n\n“That’s a great story,” Canales said. “That’s fantastic and it’s just about belief and having confidence in our guys to be able to be studs about the things we need to work on and be studs about the different decisions that come up. I love that for Lathan — for him to be able to make the winning play, the biggest play of the game for us.”\n\nThe Panthers will need more big plays from Ransom and other young players if they hope to dethrone the Buccaneers, who have won the last four NFC South titles.\n\nCarolina can clinch the division with a win next week against Seattle and a Tampa Bay loss to Miami. But if the Bucs win, it will come down to a rematch in Week 18 for the division title.\n\n“I’ve learned a bunch throughout the season, especially from that first game,” Ransom said. “You’re going to learn. It’s a learning process. You’re playing with the best of the best. I learn more and more every game and I try to take those teachings into the next game.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "The Texans face the Raiders in Houston on Sunday. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 16.",
    "fullText": "Game result: The Texans beat the Raiders, 23-21, in Week 16. Houston improves to 10-5 on the year and stays at the No. 7 seed in the AFC Playoff picture. Houston remains a game behind the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC South, who moved to 11-4 with their win over the Denver Broncos on Week 16.\n\nThe Houston Texans are closing in on a playoff berth, but it will be at least another week before they will have a clinching scenario. The Texans host the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 16 and this is a game they absolutely cannot lose.\n\nThe Texans are 9-5 and have won six straight in a streak that has included wins over the Jaguars, Bills, Colts, and Chiefs. They beat the Cardinals 40-20 last week. The Texans face a Raiders squad that is 2-12 and has lost eight straight games. Last week, the Raiders were thumped by the Eagles 31-0 in Philly.\n\nHouston is a 14.5-point favorite, which is the biggest spread of Week 16.\n\nThe Texans are in second place in the division sitting one game back of the Jaguars. Houston and Jacksonville split their season series and the Texans have a half game lead for the divisional tiebreaker (4-1 vs. 3-1). The Jaguars are traveling to face the Broncos this weekend, so if they lose that but win their two remaining games, the tiebreaker would go to record in common games.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colts sit a game back of the Texans and still has one game left with them. Houston won the first game in Week 13. The Colts need to see the Texans lose in Week 16 or 17 to create a situation in which the Colts can finish ahead of them.\n\nThe Texans are in seventh place and hold the final wild card spot ahead of the 8-6 Colts and 7-7 Ravens. If the Texans win and the Colts lose, Houston would have a wild card clinching scenario in Week 17 when they travel to face the Chargers. The Texans enter Week 16 with a 98% chance of making the playoffs at The Athletic’s playoff simulator. Houston has a 58% chance of claiming a wild card berth and a 40% chance of winning the division.\n\nThe Raiders are a common opponent for the Texans and Jaguars. There is a very real chance the Texans and Jaguars finish tied and it common opponents. They are also a common opponent with the Chargers, but Houston and LA will have a head-to-head tiebreaker sorted out when they meet in Week 17.",

    "fullText": "Welcome to Week 16 of the regular season!\n\nThere are some games to root for in these early slots as the Denver Broncos prepare to take on the Jacksonville Jaguars this afternoon. The biggest one is to pull for the Cowboys at home against the Chargers. A Denver win and Chargers loss would give them the AFC West title. The other game to consider is the Browns over the Bills, but that seems fairly unlikely to happen. If you also particularly dislike the Chiefs, you should root for them to win to keep their draft position as bad as possible. Feels good to say that!\n\nBuffalo Bills at Cleveland Browns\n\nLos Angeles Chargers at Dallas Cowboys\n\nKansas City Chiefs at Tennessee Titans\n\nCincinnati Bengals at Miami Dolphins\n\nNew York Jets at New Orleans Saints\n\nMinnesota Vikings at New York Giants\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers at Carolina Panthers\n\nDiscuss the early games in the comments section below!",

According to Next Gen stats, Detroit would have just an 8% chance to qualify for the playoffs with a loss in Week 16, as opposed to a 41% chance with a victory.\n\nThe Steelers are still in a tight battle with the Baltimore Ravens for the NFC North. Though Pittsburgh has a one-game lead and the tiebreaker advantage over Baltimore, a loss and a Ravens win this week would make things much closer.\n\nThat said, there is a lot on the line in this NFC vs. AFC contest in Detroit on Sunday. That said, here is what the experts think will transpire.\n\nBender: \"The Lions are still in the NFC playoff hunt, but they'll have to knock off an old foe in Aaron Rodgers, who has kept the Steelers in the AFC North mix. The Lions have not beat the Steelers since a 19-16 victory on Nov. 26, 1998 – the “Coin Flip” game with Jerome Bettis.  Detroit changes that with a strong running game led by Jahmyr Gibbs.\"\n\nJeremy Cluff, The Arizona Republic:Lions 30, Steelers 23\n\nCluff: \"These teams may not be battling each other for a division title, but they are fighting to make the postseason. Jared Goff and the Lions are still tough to beat at Ford Field and will get the victory in this must-win game.\"\n\nNumber of experts picking Lions: 11\n\nNumber of experts picking Steelers: 1",

    "fullText": "Jason Pierre-Paul will be 37 on New Year’s Day, hasn’t played in an NFL game in two years or produced more than three sacks in any season since helping the Bucs win Super Bowl 55 following the 2020 season.\n\nWhen Tampa Bay signed him to its practice squad on Dec. 9, it wasn’t just to put pressure on opposing quarterbacks. The team felt it could use him to put heat on some of its own players on defense.\n\nBuy FIRE THE CANNONS: 50 Years of Tampa Bay Buccaneers Football\n\nThe Bucs didn’t just need an edge rusher. They needed an edge, someone whose passion might boil over into an opponent’s penalty. A teammate they would watch with a side-eye, never fully sure what he might do next. A player who made opponents uncomfortable and injected an attitude the locker room couldn’t manufacture.\n\nIn addition to an overall lack of consistent pressure from their defensive line and outside linebacker positions, the Bucs lack someone teammates are afraid to let down.\n\nThink about the best Bucs teams from the past. The Super Bowl 37 champions were stuffed with those kinds of players on defense. Warren Sapp. Even safety John Lynch, who is about as even-tempered off the field as anyone you will ever meet, was borderline maniacal between the lines. He knocked his brother-in-law (Bears tight end John Allred) out cold in a 1997 game at Soldier Field.\n\nHardy Nickerson was that guy when Lynch, Sapp and Derrick Brooks arrived.\n\nIt also helps that Pierre-Paul has a resume. He owns 94 ½ career sacks and 21 forced fumbles. Outside linebacker Yaya Diaby leads the Bucs with only six sacks this season.\n\nLess than two weeks after Pierre-Paul was signed to the practice squad, Diaby says he’s benefited from the two-time Super Bowl champion’s counsel.\n\n“It’s been good so far, man,” Diaby said. “I can’t even lie. He’s very intentional with what he’s done and what he sees that we’ve been doing that he can improve upon. Even for me, he’ll come up and say, ‘This is what you can do to get off real faster. You could’ve done this or done that.’\n\n“So, he’s been real intentional in trying to share whatever he can. Even (Wednesday), he was telling me, ‘I don’t know everything. But what I do know, I can help you with that.”\n\nOn Saturday, Pierre-Paul was elevated from the practice squad for Sunday’s game at Carolina. Head coach Todd Bowles had said earlier in the week that Pierre-Paul was “in play” for the NFC South showdown, even with no players forced to miss the game due to injury.\n\n“I think he’s coming in and getting back acclimated systematically in some of the things we’re asking him to do,” defensive pass game coordinator George Edwards. “But I think he’s been very attentive. It’s bought into calling some of the plays he’s done in the past. He’s here working hard, so we’ll see how it goes. You never know when your number is called to be in those situations.”\n\nPierre-Paul’s energy and passion for the game is infectious, Diaby said.\n\n“He loves it, and he’s still got some juice,” Diaby said. “He’s still got some juice.”\n\nThere’s been far too many miscommunications on the Bucs defense this season. Much of it is on the players. Some of it is opponents going fast to prevent an array of blitzes and coverages to be communicated before the snap.\n\nIt’s one of the reasons why there have been so many missed assignments, a player out of position here or there because the communication breaks down.\n\nBowles always has been known for the complexity of his defense and the ability to disguise an array of blitzes. But those take time to communicate.\n\nConsequently, opponents are getting to or staying on the ball quickly between snaps.\n\n“On third down, they speed it up some,” Bowles said. “We expect that. We’ve been getting that for the last two years. We have to have calls ready. We understand that, and we do have calls ready. We expect to get sped up some.”\n\nThe Bucs and Panthers are both 5-1 in games decided by three points or less this season.\n\nWhat makes them able to execute in pressure situations?\n\n“it’s just playing smart football,” Bowles said. ”We have to play smart football, and you can’t beat yourselves and you’ve got to execute.”\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "fullText": "Browns vs. Bills radio coverage: Station, channel, streaming to listen live to NFL Week 16 game broadcast originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills’ dramatic Week 15 victory over the New England Patriots was far more than a simple rivalry win; it was a season-saving, division-defining statement.\n\nTrailing 21-0 in the first half at Gillette Stadium, quarterback Josh Allen led the Bills on a historic comeback, scoring five consecutive touchdowns to erase the deficit and secure the thrilling 35-31 win. The victory was crucial, as it prevented the Patriots from clinching the AFC East title on their home turf and kept Buffalo's own slim division hopes mathematically alive heading into the final three weeks of the season.\n\nMore importantly for their immediate postseason aspirations, that massive win cemented the Bills (10-4) as the leading Wild Card contender in the highly competitive AFC playoff picture. Currently holding the No. 6 seed, Buffalo’s favorable tiebreakers give them a strong foothold as they enter a demanding closing schedule. With the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans nipping at their heels, maintaining momentum is essential to avoid being dragged back into the desperate fight for the final playoff spots.\n\nThat urgency brings the Bills to Cleveland this Sunday for a pivotal matchup against the Browns (3-11). While Cleveland has struggled through a disappointing season, their defense —led by the perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate Myles Garrett —remains highly disruptive. The quarterback battle is one to watch: Shedeur Sanders will make his fifth NFL start against the reigning MVP in Josh Allen.\n\nUltimately, Sunday's clash at Huntington Bank Field is an absolute \"must-win\" for Buffalo. Having survived the biggest challenge of their season by battling back against the Patriots, the Bills cannot afford a letdown against a struggling opponent if they want to secure their spot in the postseason for a seventh straight year. A win would keep the pressure squarely on New England in the AFC East race and put Buffalo on the very brink of officially punching their ticket as the top team in the AFC Wild Card standings.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channel 227 (home), 382 (away)\n\nBrowns radio channel: 92.3 The Fan, 98.5 WNCX and ESPN 850, The Cleveland Browns Radio Network\n\nThe matchup between the Browns and Bills can be found nationally on SiriusXM (channel 88), along with team-specific channels.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots will try to get back into the win column this week versus the Baltimore Ravens. Naturally, all of our attention is on that particular Sunday night matchup. That said, some of the other 15 games around the NFL this week are also worth keeping a close eye on.\n\nWith that said, welcome to this week’s Patriots rooting guide.\n\nAs a disclaimer, we are looking at games through two primary lenses: New England’s chances of winning the division — which they cannot do this week — as well as earning the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Naturally and given the tiebreaker situation, not every game will be equally important even if it involves common opponents or other teams in the conference or division.\n\nThe Patriots were entering the weekend with a 73% chance of winning the division, according to The Athletic, and are 99+% favorite to make the playoffs (they actually can punch their ticket on Sunday). Their odds for the No. 1 seed are not nearly as good and a mere 10% at the moment.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7) at Carolina Panthers (7-7): Go good game! Division supremacy on the line, but the Patriots do not care who will win this one. | FOX\n\nBuffalo Bills (10-4) at Cleveland Browns (3-11): Go Browns! The Patriots won’t lock up the division this week either way, but Buffalo dropping this one would give them more wiggle room: if the Bills lose and they beat the Ravens, the Patriots would be up two games with two weeks to go. | CBS\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (10-4) at Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1): Go Cowboys! The Chargers entering the competition for the No. 1 seed in the AFC is unlikely but not entirely impossible. This is merely based on keeping another competitor away from the race for the first-round bye in the conference. | FOX\n\nCincinnati Bengals (4-10) at Miami Dolphins (6-8): Go Dolphins! Miami is out of the playoffs, so all wins do over the last three weeks is further weaken the team’s draft position. | CBS\n\nNew York Jets (3-11) at New Orleans Saints (4-10): Go Jets! This is the same we talked about with the Dolphins, namely that the Jets adding some more wins down the stretch would end up hurting their draft stock. | CBS\n\nMinnesota Vikings (6-8) at New York Giants (2-12): Go good game! This all-NFC matchup has no impact on the Patriots. | FOX\n\nKansas City Chiefs (6-8) at Tennessee Titans (2-12): Go Titans! The more games the Chiefs end up losing, the better for New England: they own a Kansas City sixth-rounder next year courtesy of the Joshua Uche trade. The worse their record, the better positioned the pick. | CBS\n\nAtlanta Falcons (5-9) at Arizona Cardinals (3-11): Go good game! Nothing to see here, really. | FOX\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (10-4) at Denver Broncos (12-2): Go Jaguars! This is a big one. If the Patriots want to take over the No. 1 seed in the AFC, they will need Denver to start losing some games. This one against the red hot Jaguars is a realistic candidate. | FOX\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (8-6) at Detroit Lions (8-6): Go Lions! The Steelers missing out on the playoffs would be good news for the Patriots and the sixth-round draft pick they received as part of the Kyle Dugger trade. Obviously, in an ideal scenario, Pittsburgh would still be ahead of the Ravens after Week 16, but a loss here would keep the chances intact of Baltimore eventually leap-frogging their division rivals and pushing them out of postseason contention. | CBS\n\nLas Vegas Raiders (2-12) at Houston Texans (9-5): Go good game! Even though this is a game between two AFC teams, including one competing for a playoff spot, the game has no real impact on New England. | CBS\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (10-4) at Indianapolis Colts (8-6): Go Colts! We end the week with a focus on draft positioning. In the unlikely case the 49ers drop out of the playoff picture in the NFC, the Patriots would benefit: the conditional sixth-round pick acquired in the Keion White trade would be better positioned in that case. | ESPN\n\nThe following games have taken place earlier in the week:\n\nLos Angeles Rams (11-3) at Seattle Seahawks (11-3): Go good game! Given the stakes, this is one of the top Thursday night games in recent memories. And while it has no impact on the Patriots, it should be a fun watch nonetheless. | LA 37, SEA 38 (OT)\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (9-5) at Washington Commanders (4-10): Go good game! A no-impact game from a Patriots perspective. | PHI 29, WAS 18\n\nGreen Bay Packers (9-4-1) at Chicago Bears (10-4): Go Packers! While the game won’t change New England’s playoff outlook, it could end up impacting the draft. The Patriots, after all, own the Bears’ fourth-round pick sent to them by the Chiefs as part of an in-draft trade last year. | GB 16, CHI 22 (OT)\n\nThis article also serves as an open thread for this week’s games. Please head down to the comment section to discuss and share your thoughts on the games as they unfold.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCleveland edge rusher Myles Garrett is on the edge of making NFL history.\n\nGarrett – who has 21.5 sacks – can tie the NFL single-season sack record held by former Giants star Michael Strahan and Steelers edge rusher T.J Watt with his next sack. Garrett, of course, is playing for the Browns – who have been eliminated from the AFC playoff race.\n\nThat's going to beg the question: Is Garrett the best player on the worst team in NFL history? We're not just talking about this year. We're talking for the entirety of their career.\n\nSporting News identified 16 NFL stars – including eight Pro Football Hall of Fame players – who fit that description. We ranked those players based on four categories, including worst team winning percentage, playoff appearances (fewest scored higher), Pro Bowl selections (highest to lowest) and NFL MVP or AP Defensive Player of the Year Awards.

He played for seven different head coaches – ranging from Mike Ditka to Nick Saban – retired for a year and was suspended for another. Williams played on a 3-13 team in New Orleans and a 1-15 team in Miami.\n\nTeams: Buccaneers (1987-92), Browns (1993-95), Ravens (1996-97), Jets (1998-2003, 2005), Cowboys (2004), Patriots (2006), Panthers (2007)\n\nTeam playoff record: 4–3 (2-3 as a starter)\n\nThe Buccaneers were 28-67 in six seasons after selecting Testaverde with the No. 1 pick in the 1987 NFL Draft. Testaverde was 23-25 in three seasons with Bill Belichick in Cleveland. He spent two seasons in Baltimore before the best stretch of his career with the Jets and made a start in the 1998 AFC championship game against Denver. Testaverde reunited with Bill Parcells in Dallas and Belichick in New England late in his career. He finished with a 90-123-1 record as a starter with 46,233 yards, which ranks 18th on the all-time list.\n\nTeams: Bengals (1996-2007), Ravens (2008)\n\nAnderson – a four-time Pro Bowl selection – played for four different coaches during the late 1990s and early 2000s \"Bungles\" era, and he played on just one winning team in 12 seasons with the franchise. Anderson played in one playoff game – a heart-breaking 31-17 loss to the Steelers in the AFC Wild Card round. Anderson did reach the AFC championship game with rival Balti\n\nTeams: Colts (1983-89), Falcons (1990-93), Vikings (1994-95)\n\nHinton – a seven-time Pro Bowl selection – was the player the Colts got in the John Elway trade. Hinton was a mainstay at tackle, but the Colts had four straight losing seasons after his arrival. Hinton played in four playoff games in his career, which also had stints with the Falcons and Vikings. He probably deserves more Pro Football Hall of Fame consideration.\n\nSanders – who ranks fourth all time in NFL history with 15,269 yards – played on decent teams. Detroit had a winning record in five of his 10 seasons and made the NFC championship game in 1991. Sanders abruptly retired in 1998 after the Lions finished 5-11 in 1998. Sanders' highlight reel has been passed down a few generations – but he never played in a Super Bowl.\n\nTeams: Rams (2004-12), Falcons (2013-14), Patriots (2015)\n\nJackson played on some miserable teams in St. Louis. The Rams averaged three wins per season from 2007-11 – a stretch in which Jackson had five straight 1,000-yard seasons. He finished his career with 11,438 rushing yards, and one of his two career playoff victories was in an abbreviated final season with the Patriots in 2015.\n\nSayers had a brief-but-brilliant career with the Bears, which was cut short by injuries. Sayers played for George Halas for four seasons – a stretch where Chicago compiled a 28-25-3 record. He led the NFL in rushing with 236 carries for 1,032 yards and eight TDs in 1969, a season in which the Bears finished 1-13.\n\nTeams: Saints (1993-2001); Chiefs (2002-05)\n\nRoaf was a dominant tackle in the NFL for the Saints – and he played for three head coaches in Jim Mora, Mike Ditka and Jim Haslett. New Orleans won one playoff game – a 34-24 victory against St. Louis in the NFC Wild Card round – on Dec. 30, 2000. He played four seasons with Kansas City – including two winning teams – to end his career.\n\nTeams: Jaguars (2006-13), Raiders (2014)\n\nJones-Drew helped Jacksonville reach the AFC divisional playoffs in his second season, but it went downhill from there despite a successful career in which he finished with 8,167 rushing yards in nine seasons. MJD played on teams that won an average of three games in his final three seasons between Jacksonville and Oakland.\n\nStephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nCrosby – who has 69.5 career sacks – has been with the franchise since the move from Oakland to Las Vegas. He has endured four straight losing seasons with the Raiders and has played for three coaches in each of the last three seasons. Yet Crosby remains on a trajectory that would get him to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Browns went 0-16 in Garrett's first season, so it's technically been uphill from there. Garrett has played for the same coach for six seasons in Kevin Stefanski, and the Browns did beat the Steelers 48-37 in the AFC Wild Card round on Jan. 10, 2021. It hasn't been all bad for the former No. 1 pick.\n\nJohnson never played on a team that won a playoff game. Detroit finished 0-16 in his second season, but \"Megatron\" continued to produce at a ridiculous level. The six-time Pro Bowl selection had 122 catches for a single-season record 1,964 receiving yards in 2012. Detroit had two winning seasons in nine years with Johnson on the field.\n\nKennedy – an eight-time Pro Bowl selection – never played on a team that won 10 games or \n\nYou can't think about the Tampa Bay creamsicle jerseys without Selmon, the six-time Pro Bowl selection who dominated at defensive tackle for the Bucs despite some woeful teams. Tampa Bay went 0-14 in Selmon's rookie season, and they lost 10 or more games six times in his nine seasons.\n\nButkus – arguably the most-feared defensive player of his era – was on the same teams as Gale Sayers, but the linebacker played two more seasons. Butkus made the Pro Bowl eight times in eight seasons before his final year, in which he played just nine games. He also finished in the top five in the NFL MVP voting twice despite playing for teams that finished with records of 8-8 and 7-9, respectively.\n\nThomas is the easiest choice here. He was a 10-time Pro Bowl selection in Cleveland despite a cast of revolving door of quarterbacks and coaches through one of the most-unstable periods for any franchise in NFL history. Cleveland went 10-6 in Thomas' first season. The Browns never won more than five games over the next 10 years, and Thomas' final season was the 0-16 year in 2017. Despite that, Thomas remains one of the most-beloved athletes in Cleveland sports history.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nYou may have felt that this was the case for some time already in a matter of fact sense, but it became official on Saturday night when the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Washington Commanders. Thanks to losses over the last two weeks to the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings the Cowboys left themselves with only one path into the postseason and that was as the hypothetical winner of the NFC East. That will not come to pass as the Eagles have now won it.\n\nMuch is always made about how the NFC East has not featured a back-to-back champion since 2003 and 2004 when the Eagles did it themselves. They have put that all to an end by doing it once more and on the subject of streaks the Cowboys now have one going themselves as far as playoff absences are concerned.\n\nDallas missed the playoffs last year, they were eliminated around the same time as it happened on December 22nd, which means they have missed the postseason for two years in a row for the first time since 2019 and 2020. Then, like now, the Cowboys were in the final year of one head coach (Jason Garrett) and the first of another (Mike McCarthy). It is almost like that is not necessarily a recipe for success.\n\nThere is a lot of introspection that is necessary from the Cowboys these days and their current playoff drought is representative of that. We talk often about how this team hasn’t been the same since they were bounced from the 2023 Wild Card Round and obviously the evidence here speaks for that as well.\n\nWe now know conclusively that there are only 3 games left on the season for the Cowboys. We also know that their drought for Super Bowl and/or NFC Championship Game appearances (the drought that Stephen Jones didn’t understand to exist) will officially grow to 30 years. It is not an approximation or a rounding up.",

    "description": "Rohit Ponnaiya breaks down his favorite Week 16 NFL player props, including Jacoby Brissett and Aaron Rodgers.",
    "fullText": "It's going to be a Blue Christmas for Tua Tagovailoa, who has been benched by the Dolphins. With Miami breaking in a rookie QB, my NFL props are betting on RB De'Von Achane to carry the offense.\n\nSee why I'm backing Achane, Jacoby Brissett, and Aaron Rodgers with my favorite NFL player props for Week 16 in the NFL.\n\nKyler Murray who? Jacoby Brissett gone over his passing yards total in all nine of his starts this season. He has thrown the ball at least 40 times in six straight contests, averaging a whopping 45.7 pass attempts per game over that span.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have struggled to run the ball and have practically abandoned that part of their offense. They are second in the NFL in passing play percentage (65.4%), with that number ballooning to 72.5% over the last six weeks.\n\nThe Cardinals are hosting the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday in a beautiful 76-degree day at State Farm Stadium. That should lead to plenty of throwing from a pair of teams with nothing to play for except pride.\n\nWith the Miami Dolphins starting seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers at QB expect them to lean on their rushing attack against a piss-poor Bengals run defense. Cincinnati is 30th in the NFL in defensive rush EPA and allows a league-high 157.9 rushing yards per game.\n\nEven if the Bengals sell out to stop the run, they won't be able to contain Achane. They allow 5.0 yards per carry when stacking the box, and De'Von Achane averages 5.8 yards per attempt when running against a stacked box.\n\nAchane is coming off a game where he was limited to 60 yards on 12 carries due to a negative game script. However, he had rushed for more than 90 yards in his previous four contests, averaging 130.0 rushing yards per game over that span.\n\nAaron Rodgers is coming off back-to-back contests where he completed 23 passes in wins against the Dolphins and Ravens. The four-time MVP is proving that he still has something left in the tank, and he faces a struggling Detroit Lions pass defense in Week 16.\n\nThe Lions are 25th in the league in dropback EPA since Week 9. Their injury-depleted secondary is getting picked apart with Detroit allowing 24.3 completions per game over the last three contests.\n\nWith the Lions 7-point faves on Sunday, expect a negative game script for the Pittsburgh Steelers with plenty of passing. Rodgers has completed more than 20.5 passes in six of his last nine games and should eclipse that number again.\n\nAfter a red-hot start to the season, Jacksonville Jaguars running back Travis Etienne Jr. has cooled off. Etienne has logged fewer than 60 rushing yards in six of his last 10 games and is averaging just 3.8 yards per carry over that span.\n\nHe was held to fewer than 35 rushing yards and less than 3.0 ypa in two of his last three games. What's especially concerning about those numbers is that they came with a positive game script against terrible Titans and Jets defenses.\n\nHe'll have a much tougher time in Week 16 against a Denver stop unit that allows the second-fewest rushing yards per game (90.9) on 3.9 yards per carry. Etienne is at his best on outside zone runs, where he averages 6.9 yards per rush. However, the Broncos allow just 3.3 yards per rush on outside zone attempts.\n\nNew Orleans Saints wideout Chris Olave reeled in six catches for 85 yards last week. He has logged at least 62 receiving yards in six of his last nine games, and he's finally getting good quarterback play with Tyler Shough under center.\n\nOlave gets a mouth-watering matchup this week at home against the New York Jets, who traded away top corner Sauce Gardner at the deadline. The Jets are 31st in the league in defensive dropback EPA while ranking 28th in DVOA against No. 1 WRs.\n\nOlave has been the Saints' only reliable pass catcher after they traded Rashid Shaheed and Brandin Cooks, so expect him to get fed the ball. This is a five-star play according to EV Analytics, which is projecting 71.57 yards for Olave.\n\nBrissett o37.5 pass attempts (-120)\n\nRodgers o20.5 completions (-138)\n\nEtienne u60.5 rush yards (-114)\n\nOlave o61.5 receiving yards (-114)\n\nMy NFL weekly props column is 39-31 this season for +3.86 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "This 2025 NFL season hasn’t been what was expected from the Arizona Cardinals. In a division full of some of the league’s best ballclubs, the Cardinals aren’t one of them.\n\nBut there are silver linings. And with some, you don’t have to look too hard. Arizona tight end Trey McBride might be this year’s brightest star on the roster. He has already set one league record several weeks ago, and now this past weekend, he set two more.\n\nIn the Cardinals’ 40-20 loss to the Houston Texans this past Sunday, McBride had 12 receptions for 134 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead all pass catchers.\n\nAmong the flow of the game, McBride set two records: 1) “Most consecutive games by a tight end with five or more catches,” and 2) “First tight end in NFL history to have 100 catches or \n\nWith the first record, McBride now has 16 consecutive games, which broke the record of 15 held by Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2018.\n\nLast year, McBride caught 111 passes for 1,146 yards. He now has 105 passes for 1,071 this season with three games remaining.\n\nMcBride can now set his sights on the NFL record for “Most receptions by a tight end in a single season.” The record is 116 catches set by former Cardinal Zack Ertz in 2018 while he was playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. Needing an even dozen in three games shouldn’t be an issue for McBride.\n\nHe is currently ranked #1 in receptions in the league, #2 in targets, #3 in touchdowns, #4 in first down conversions, #6 in total yards gained, and #25 in pass completions of 20+ yards.\n\nTwo weeks ago, McBride broke the NFL record for the “Most receptions by a tight end in his first four seasons in the league.” The old record was set by tight end Jimmy Graham, who had 3,863 yards on 301 receptions. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 13, McBride led all receivers with eight catches for 82 yards and a touchdown, and finished with 309 career receptions. He has since added to that total.",

    "description": "Dillon Thieneman could be an upgrade for Cincinnati at safety.",
    "fullText": "With the College Football Playoff kicking off, here are some of the most notable NFL Draft prospects to watch for this weekend.\n\nAlabama against Oklahoma is a rematch from earlier this season. Oklahoma pulled out a close victory against the Crimson Tide 23 to 21 in that game. I expect this game to come right down to the wire once again. We have previously discussed some Alabama prospects like Kadyn Proctor, Tim Keenan III, Deontae Lawson, and Keon Sabb. The Cincinnati Bengals could be looking to add a cornerback to replace Cam Taylor-Britt going into next year. Alabama’s Domani Jackson could be a player who intrigues the Bengals. He feels like a player that could go anywhere from rounds three to five during the draft this year. While he hasn’t had the season that many expected, he is still a solid draft prospect. He is expected to run a 4.3 40-yard dash or potentially even lower. Jackson is a great athlete with return ability, an excellent run defender, and rarely misses a tackle. He has an incredible 2.6% missed tackle rate on the 2025 season.\n\nDomani Jackson (Alabama CB #1)\n-Uses his long frame to force receivers off of their route and disrupt timing of the play\n-Shows scheme flexibility and is capable in both man and zone coverage\n-Has moments where his build and toughness align effectively as a true bump and run… pic.twitter.com/CYIsf4ShLT\n\n— Owen Denny (@OwenDennyNFL) December 4, 2025\n\nOklahoma has a plethora of defensive talent that should be of interest to the Bengals. We have mentioned previously R.Mason Thomas, Robert Spears-Jennings, Kip Lewis, and Gracen Halton. Another player on that defense worth mentioning for the 2026 NFL Draft is Damonic Williams. Williams is a day three space eating defensive tackle. Williams is listed at 6’1” and 323 pounds. He does his best work as a run defender in the middle of the Sooners defense. Williams originally spent a couple of seasons playing for TCU.\n\nDamonic Williams about to wreck SEC O-Lines! 😤\n pic.twitter.com/veDDTDhX1n\n\n— The Main Line (@TheMainLinePod) May 3, 2024\n\nTexas A&M has a lot of talent in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Cashius Howell, Tyler Onyedim, and Albert Regis headline the defensive line. On the offensive line they are loaded with draft-elibile talent like Trey Zuhn III, Dametrious Crownover, Chase Bisontis, and Ar’maj Reed-Adams. If the Bengals decide to not re-sign Dalton Risner, they may look once again toward the draft for a right guard. While that isn’t a guarantee with Jalen Rivers here, it is at least worth mentioning. Reed-Adams is a right guard prospect that could come in and compete to start early. He is a mauling presence on the interior that loves to finish plays, sometimes to his own detriment with penalties. That type of nasty is something this Cincinnati team is missing.\n\nAr’maj Reed-Adams is a DAWG at Right Guard (even took some Right Tackle snaps in this one) pic.twitter.com/tmBzRySVIh\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) May 8, 2025\n\nMiami is equally as impressive on both sides of the ball in the trenches. On offense, they have Francis Mauigoa, Markel Bell, Anez Cooper, and James Brockermyer. On the defensive line they have Rueben Bain Jr., Ahmad Moten Sr., and Akheem Mesidor. Mesidor is an older prospect that will be turning 25 years old. We have seen previously with the pick of Demetrius Knight Jr., that age may not scare the Bengals off from taking an older guy on day two. Mesidor has 30 career sacks between his time at West Virginia and Miami. When healthy, he is an explosive pass rusher with a quick first step and a variety of pass rush moves in his arsenal. He has a 29.9% win rate on true pass sets during the 2025 season.\n\nAkheem Mesidor (#3) Miami vs. Notre Dame – Mesidor will turn 25 years old in April and has put up 7 sacks, 43 pressures, and 4 forced fumbles so far this season. \n\nAt 6’3” 280 pounds he offers inside and outside versatility along the defensive line. He is a high effort player,… pic.twitter.com/gZ8wqkZ7aS\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 26, 2025\n\nOle Miss will be entering this game without former head coach Lane Kiffin. Kiffin will not be coaching in the playoffs after taking the LSU job. Ole Miss still has a ton of talented players and should easily handle Tulane this weekend. Zxavian Harris is a big-bodied defensive tackle I have previously discussed. They also have Dae’quan Wright, Harrison Wallace III, and De’Zhaun Stribling as offensive weapons. Another player that continues to intrigue me is Suntarine Perkins. The Bengals have tried to use Demetrius Knight Jr. as a player that can come off the edge at times with limited results. While Knight did put up two sacks this week, it was while playing the role of a spy on Lamar Jackson. If they want a player with real pass rush juice from the linebacker position, Perkins may be there guy. Perkins had 10.5 sacks last season while playing more on the edge. This year, he has just two sacks but has shown that he can play more as an off-ball linebacker, which he needed to do at only 6’1” 210 pounds.\n\nOle Miss's Suntarine Perkins might be my favorite prospect I watched all summer. Can't remember someone his size (6-1, 210) playing on the line of scrimmage in a major conference and still being a difference maker. \n\nDon't care where he plays, I want him on my football team pic.twitter.com/EAjzxQJC8Q\n\n— Mike Renner (@mikerenner_) July 30, 2025\n\nFor Tulane, there really isn’t much to talk about for the draft. Quarterback Jake Retzlaff is a transfer from BYU that might get a camp invitation. He is unlikely to be on a roster in the NFL next year. The best prospect for them is defensive tackle/defensive end Santana Hopper, but it sounds like he will be entering the transfer portal and remaining in college football next year.\n\nTulane first-team all-conference DL Santana Hopper is expected to enter the transfer portal following the College Football Playoff, sources tell @On3sports. \n\nHas 13 career sacks. https://t.co/wMrfFrcNOy pic.twitter.com/rOyVZFN4v7\n\n— Pete Nakos (@PeteNakos) December 16, 2025\n\nAnother contest that is likely to be heavily one sided features Oregon taking on James Madison. Oregon has a ton of draft-eligible talent including Dante Moore (QB), Noah Whittington (RB), Kenyon Sadiq (TE), Isaiah World (OT), Alex Harkey (OT), Emmanuel Pregnon (OG), Iapani Laloulu (OC), Matayo Uiagalelei (DE), Bear Alexander (DT), A’Mauri Washington (DT), Bryce Boettcher (LB), Jadon Canady (CB), and Dillon Thieneman (S). Thieneman is the most likely player that could end up a Cincinnati Bengal. The rangy safety prospect has good straight-line speed and has been highly productive for both Purdue and Oregon during his time in college football.\n\nDillon Thieneman vs. Indiana pic.twitter.com/WEel3shdxI\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 20, 2025\n\nSimilar to Tulane, there really isn’t much for James Madison as far as draft prospects for this year. Wayne Knight is probably the best prospect on their team. However, the running back is listed at just 5’7”. He is listed at weighing around 190 pounds and has shown impressive contact balance. Knight has rushed for almost 1300 yards in 2025. He has also added almost 400 more yards as a receiver. Knight will have to play out of his mind against Oregon for James Madison to even keep this one close.\n\nJust incredible contact balance from James Madison’s Wayne Knight to pop through here.\n\nHe’s top three in the Sun Belt in rushing yards after contact pic.twitter.com/6IELz0SmUM\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) December 6, 2025",

SAUBERT. @SEAHAWKS WIN! pic.twitter.com/VF2QElidFV\n\nThis year is the first season in which regular season overtime does not automatically end on an opening drive offensive touchdown. The only difference between regular season and playoff overtime (which eliminated “offensive touchdown on first possession wins the game” starting in the 2022 season) is that regular season OT is still just 10 minutes and not 15. Barring a defensive or special teams touchdown (or a safety), both offenses must possess the ball at least once.\n\nThe catalyst for this change was the famous Kansas City Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills AFC Divisional playoff classic in the 201 season, in which Josh Allen never touched the ball in overtime and the Chiefs scored a touchdown on the first possession and never looked back.\n\nWhile we’ve yet to see an opening drive overtime touchdown under the current rules in the playoffs, this is the first time that a team has conceded an overtime touchdown and come back to win the game. The Jacksonville Jaguars scored a touchdown against the Las Vegas Raiders earlier this season, only for the Raiders to respond with their own. Geno Smith’s winning pass to Tyler Lockett was batted down and Jacksonville won.\n\nIt’s only fitting that such a weird thing would first be done by the Seahawks. We expect nothing less.",

    "description": "Targeting value in Week 16 NFL betting? We break down three plus-money predictions worth backing, with matchup analysis, betting angles, and odds insight.",
    "fullText": "Plus-money props are where opportunity meets context, and this week offers plenty of both.\n\nA rookie quarterback heading on the road is being undervalued by the market, while two proven veterans are playing with real money on the line as contract incentives come into focus.\n\nMotivation, matchup, and usage all align to create outsized NFL picks at longer odds.\n\nSince returning to the lineup, J.J. McCarthy looks rejuvenated, throwing five touchdown passes against vulnerable Washington and Dallas defenses. The Giants profile similarly when it comes to stopping offenses near the goal line, making this another spot where efficiency should show up on the scoreboard.\n\nNew York ranks bottom five in red-zone defense and is riding an eight-game losing skid, allowing 31.5 points per game. This is a defense that struggles to stop drives, and the Minnesota Vikings are well-positioned to take advantage. McCarthy has also shown he’s not afraid to push the ball downfield, ranking second in air yards per attempt while benefiting from the second-best protection rate in the league at 88 percent.\n\nMinnesota’s red-zone tendencies further support the Over. The Vikings have been ineffective running the ball near the goal line to the point that C.J. Ham handled the short-yardage touchdown last week. As a result, Minnesota ranks among the most pass-heavy teams in the red zone. All signs point toward McCarthy clearing 1.5 passing touchdowns.\n\nStefon Diggs has incentive money firmly in play with three games remaining. He’s three receptions shy of a $500K bonus, and 13 catches away from another $500K, putting a total of $1 million on the line. Diggs has recorded at least three receptions in all but one game this season, but has been quieter recently in a pair of run-heavy matchups against the Bills and Giants.\n\nThat could change this week against Baltimore, a defense allowing the sixth-most receptions to wide receivers. If Diggs wants to make a real push toward that second incentive at 80 catches, the volume needs to start building now. With the Jets up next and a Week 18 matchup against Miami that could turn run-heavy if playoff positioning is settled, this sets up as a spot where Diggs is motivated, and the matchup finally cooperates.\n\nFollow me here, because this angle makes sense. Nick Folk has been one of the most reliable kickers in the league, converting 96.2 percent of his attempts, the best mark in the NFL. This also happens to be his final indoor game of the season before trips to the Meadowlands and Orchard Park in Weeks 17 and 18, where kicking conditions become far less predictable.\n\nFolk sits at 25 made field goals and has significant incentives in play, earning $375K at 27 makes and another $500K if he reaches 30. He kicks for an offense that struggles to finish drives and draws another favorable matchup against the Saints this week. Indoors, the leash is longer, and there’s a real chance the coaching staff is more aggressive with long attempts than they’d consider outdoors. Folk has missed just one kick all season and is 7-for-8 from 50-plus, which could turn a few borderline decisions into field goal tries with real incentive-driven upside.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Thursday delivers a slate built around one game that carries monumental weight in the NFL, as the Seahawks and Rams collide in a pivotal divisional showdown with major playoff implications on the line. While the spotlight shines brightest on the NFC West battle, the night also features a full menu of NHL action where matchups, trends and numbers create value across the board. Here are tonight’s best bets brought to you by BetOnline.ag. All new players get a 50% welcome bonus and up to $250 in free bets.\n\nRundown: A pair of 11-3 teams collide on Thursday Night Football as the Los Angeles Rams travel to Seattle to face the Seahawks, with sole possession of first place in the NFC West on the line.\n\nTonight marks uncharted territory for the NFL. For the first time in league history, two teams with 11 or more wins meet on Thursday Night Football, as the Rams and Seahawks square off with the No. 1 seed hanging in the balance. Given the stakes, the matchup has a strong case as the most significant Thursday night game the league has ever seen.\n\nAccording to FTN’s proprietary metric DVOA (defensive-adjusted value over average), these are two of the best teams ever through 14 games. The statistic has been tracked since 1978, with the 2007 Patriots ranking No. 1 all time after finishing the regular season a perfect 16-0.\n\nHistory in the making 👀\n\nWeek 15 DVOA Ratings ➡️ https://t.co/T1Gel5KrfN pic.twitter.com/azJiozirlq\n\n— FTN Fantasy (@FTNFantasy) December 17, 2025\n\nSeattle and Los Angeles have been elite on both sides of the ball, each ranking inside the top five in scoring offense and scoring defense. Much of that success has been driven by two of the NFL’s premier wide receivers. Seattle’s Jaxon Smith-Njigba leads the league with 1,541 receiving yards on 96 catches, while Los Angeles has leaned heavily on third-year wideout Puka Nacua. The Rams will likely be without Davante Adams, however, as the future Hall of Famer is dealing with a hamstring injury suffered in Sunday’s win over Detroit.\n\nWeather could also a noteworthy factor that affects the outcome. Rain is expected throughout the night in Seattle, conditions that often push offenses to lean on the ground game. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum headline the Rams’ backfield, while Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet carry the load for the Seahawks.\n\nWith first place at stake, key skill players potentially sidelined and slick field conditions in play, expect both defenses to prioritize limiting explosive plays and force long, methodical drives. A slower tempo paired with two elite defensive units points toward a tightly contested game that struggles to reach the projected point total.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Kings (14-10-9) wrap up a three-game road trip as they visit the Tampa Bay Lightning (18-12-3) at Benchmark International Arena.\n\nEntering tonight, both teams are looking to get back on track. Tampa Bay arrives after consecutive losses to the New York Islanders and Florida, while Los Angeles has dropped four straight. Defense has been a common strength, with both clubs ranking inside the top five in goals allowed. Tampa Bay sits fifth and Los Angeles second, with each allowing 2.6 goals per game. That combined average of 5.2 goals comes in slightly below tonight’s projected total.\n\nDefense has not been the lone driver of Tampa Bay’s success this season. Through 33 games, the Lightning are averaging 3.2 goals per game, eighth-best in the NHL. Strong play at both ends of the ice has helped Tampa Bay post a plus-19 goal differential, which ranks fourth in the league.\n\nLos Angeles, meanwhile, has leaned heavily on its defensive structure, but its offense has lagged behind. The Kings enter with the NHL’s 30th-ranked scoring offense and will need to find some consistency to keep the losing skid from growing. With two elite defensive units on the ice, expect scoring chances to be limited and the pace to stay controlled in a low-scoring matchup.",

This only tended to take place in years when Christmas Day would fall on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday.\n\nEarlier this season, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that from this year onwards there would be three games held every year on 25 December.\n\nSince 2021, two or three games have taken place on Christmas Day each year, with this year being a three-game day, much like in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAll three Christmas Day matches are between teams that have strong rivalries.\n\nThe Washington Commanders will host the Dallas Cowboys in the first game of the day, with the Minnesota Vikings playing at home against the Detroit Lions in the second.\n\nIn the third and final game of the day the Kansas City Chiefs face the Denver Broncos.\n\nWhile all three games kick off on Christmas Day in America, because of time zone differences the Chiefs-Broncos game will actually start in the early hours of 26 December at 01:15 GMT.\n\nStreaming site Netflix will show the first two games, as it did in 2024. The third match will be shown on Prime Video.\n\nIn 1971, the NFL held its first two Christmas Day matches following the merger between the American Football League and National Football League in the previous year.\n\nThose two matches were play-off games and the unpopularity of the decision to host the Christmas Day double-header led to an 18-year gap before matches were played again on 25 December.\n\nThursday, 25 December 18:00: Dallas Cowboys @ Washington Commanders\n\nThursday, 25 December 21:30: Detroit Lions @ Minnesota Vikings\n\nFriday, 26 December 01:15: Denver Broncos @ Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy are there NFL matches on Thanksgiving?\n\nWhy do some NFL rookies struggle in their second year?\n\nWhat are the differences between NFL wide receivers and tight ends?\n\nHow does studying game film work in American football?",

    "description": "Rams vs. Seahawks predictions and NFL picks for Thursday Night Football. Los Angeles stays a step ahead of Seattle.",
    "fullText": "The top spot in the NFC is on the line when the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks face off in a heavyweight Thursday Night Football matchup.\n\nMy Rams vs Seahawks predictions and NFL picks side with the visiting Rams, who have a lot of betting trends on their side.\n\nKickoff is set for 8:15 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in beautiful Seattle, with the game airing on Prime Video on Thursday, December 18.\n\nRams vs Seahawks best bet: Rams -1 (-105)\n\nI like backing betting trends, so it’s near impossible to overlook the Los Angeles Rams in this spot at a reasonable number.\n\nLos Angeles has been one of the most reliable late-season bets in the NFL, compiling a 17–3 ATS record in their last 20 games played in the month of December. That trend has continued this year, with the Rams starting December 2–0 while piling up 86 total points against Arizona and Detroit, surpassing 500 yards of offense in both games. They’re peaking at the right time.\n\nThey’ve also dominated the spread in matchups against the Seattle Seahawks, covering 11 of the last 14 meetings, including five straight at Lumen Field. That level of consistency against a division opponent is hard to dismiss, particularly in a building that’s traditionally been difficult for visitors.\n\nRoad performance has also been a strength. Los Angeles has gone 11–2 ATS in its last 13 road games and owns a 17–5 ATS mark overall since December 1 of last season. Whether home or away, this team has shown an ability to travel and execute in high-leverage spots.\n\nEven setting trends aside, there are reasons for skepticism on the Seattle side.\n\nThe Seahawks escaped with a narrow win over the Philip Rivers-led Colts last week despite being nearly two-touchdown favorites, and while they continue to accumulate wins, Sam Darnold’s play has cooled off. It’s also very fair to question his confidence in standalone, high-pressure games after he completely melted down at the end of last season with the Vikings.\n\nThat concern is amplified by the matchup itself. The Rams are 3–0 against Darnold since the start of last season and forced him into costly mistakes, including a four-interception performance just over a month ago.\n\nTrends alone don’t decide games, but when form, matchup history, and quarterback results all point in the same direction, they deserve attention. On a short week in Seattle, the data suggests the Rams are once again positioned to continue their strong December run.\n\nIn addition to being 3-0 vs Darnold since the beginning of last season, Los Angeles has owned the Seahawks, going 11-3 ATS against them in the last 14 matchups. Look for Kyren Williams to add to his 13 total TDs vs. a Seattle defense that's allowed the most receptions in the NFL to opposing running backs.\n\nKyren Williams anytime touchdown\n\nKyren Williams Over 1.5 receptions\n\nJSN has reached the 100-yard mark in an amazing eight of his last 10 games, including going for 105 vs. the Rams on November 15. Los Angeles has allowed the sixth-most receiving yards to the wide receiver position this season.\n\nKyren Williams anytime touchdown\n\nKyren Williams Over 1.5 receptions\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba Over 95.5 receiving yards\n\nThe Rams have hit their stride during the stretch run of the season with back-to-back wins where they’ve dropped 40+ points and 500+ yards. I’m not going to stand in front of that vs Darnold, who can’t be trusted in big spots like this.\n\nWith the Rams being 17-3 ATS in their last 20 games played in December while also being 11-3 ATS in their last 14 games vs the Seahawks, I’ll happily side with them to cover.\n\nThe Under also profiles well in a matchup between two of the league’s top defenses. These teams rank second and third in points allowed and played to a 21–19 game in November that was tracking even lower before late touchdowns. Unless short fields or defensive scores swing the script, the metrics point toward a lower-scoring game.\n\nSpread: Los Angeles -1.5 (+100) | Seattle +1.5 (-122)\n\nMoneyline: Los Angeles -106 | Seattle -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 42 (-110) | Under 42.5 (-110)\n\nThe Rams are 17-3 ATS in their last 20 games played in December.

    "fullText": "NFL Mock Draft 2026: Jets opt for Oregon's Dante Moore, Chiefs replace Travis Kelce and Ohio State owns Round 1 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe College Football Playoff will feature plenty of great future NFL talent with the 12 teams making the field. While it might not be surprising Ohio State's loaded team dominates the pro prospects, 18 of Sporting News' 32 first-round projections in all are tied to CFP action.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead with five such picks, with Georgia, Oregon, Texas A&M, Alabama and Miami also in line to have multiple selections on Day 1. Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas Tech get on the board, too. That's incredible representation from three-fourths of the CFP teams, which also account for all three QBs and four of the first five overall picks.\n\nHere is the Sporting News' latest NFL Mock Draft ahead of the 2025 College Football playoff.\n\nMORE: Bills, 49ers rise as Packers fade in latest SN Power Rankings\n\n(No. 1-18 order courtesy of Tankathon; No. 19-32 from Week 16 playoff picture)\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Giants, if they stay at No. 1 overall and don't trade out of this pick for a team wanting a quarterback, should consider taking Reese as an all-around force to fix a lot of their defensive issues away from a rather productive pass rush.\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (6-5, 225 pounds)\n\nThe Raiders can't be happy with their quarterback situation post-Derek Carr, with Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett screaming that they need to go after a true, strong, accurate franchise passer solution. Mendoza looks the part with his arm and intangibles, two things that should appeal to the influence of Tom Brady.\n\nMORE: How Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman over Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin\n\nRueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-3, 275 pounds)\n\nThe Titans also don't need a QB after taking Cam Ward No. 1 overall last year, but they can go back to the Hurricanes program to get the game-changing pass-rusher they desperately need for their latest defensive reboot.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State (6-2, 200 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to stop messing around at wide receiver and give either Shedeur Sanders or a different starting quarterback a true go-to all over the field, both in the slot and outside, in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jaxon Smith-Njigba vein, only lacking the hyphen.\n\nDante Moore, QB, Oregon (6-3, 206 pounds)\n\nMoore has the leadership and intangibles to handle being the next shot at a franchise QB in New York as well as the savvy and strong arm. They also need to get a real long-term option after the Justin Fields flop.\n\nTroy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Network\n\nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (6-0, 214 pounds)\n\nThe Cardinals saw the breakdown early of pending free agent James Conner and have had an unhealthy mess of a committee trying to replace him. This may seem like a luxury pick for a team that has a lot of needs, but they can get some tackle help later and Love can be a game-changer for restoring balance and expanding the explosiveness.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC (5-11, 195 pounds)\n\nThe Saints, should they stick with Tyler Shough at QB, need to give him more weapons after depleting the receiving crops beyond Chris Olave. Kellen Moore can have some visions of Lemon being the DeVonta Smith to Olave's A.J. Brown should Shough show big improvement.\n\nMORE: Sporting News' expert predictions for 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State (6-0, 205 pounds)\n\nThe Commanders need to get younger and more impactful in their defense after things fell apart in their secondary and around Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Downs is a terrific do-everything hybrid who would be set up to make a lot of big plays in Dan Quinn's scheme.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson (6-3, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Bengals need to keep beefing up their defensive line to pull out of being atrocious against the run and it doesn't hurt to have some of Woods' inside pass-rush juice to support their end rotation.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee (6-0, 193 pounds)\n\nThe Rams know that cornerback coverage is their biggest weakness on an otherwise loaded roster, with some retooling needed. They keep up the strong defensive pick momentum with the nice-sized, tough McCoy.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT, Miami (6-6, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Dolphins need to get more offensive line help for wherever they go at QB and they can stay in town to get a long-term all-around rock in Mauigoa.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon (6-3, 245 pounds)\n\nThe Chiefs need to be feeling the imminence of Travis Kelce's retirement and can step right into drafting his dynamic go-to receiver replacement to boost Patrick Mahomes again once he returns from his torn ACL.\n\nMORE: Why it's not time to announce the Chiefs dynasty over yet\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Vikings will need to keep working on their secondary with some contract issues ahead and Delane is not that far off in battling McCoy for the status as the best corner in this class.\n\nDavid Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech (6-3, 250 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys will go to work on replacing Micah Parsons' pass rush production with this Lubbock chess piece who has all the moves to get to the quarterback as well as unique dropback coverage ability for the position.\n\nMORE: Full list of stadiums hosting 2025 College Football Playoff games\n\nKeldric Faulk, EDGE, Auburn (6-6, 285 pounds)\n\nThe Ravens should love this complete outside linebacker option who can provide power vs. the run as well as needed pass-rush juice.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Panthers have been feeling the void at linebacker for a while after it was once a strength and GM Dan Morgan should have intrigue to go for his former position with Styles, a versatile talent who makes a lot of plays everywhere along with Reese.\n\nCashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M (6-2, 248 pounds)\n\nHowell can give the Lions the needed strong complementary pass rusher for Aidan Hutchinson to relieve their secondary coverage a lot more next season.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson (5-11, 180 pounds)\n\nThe Jets, after going QB with Moore earlier in this mock, can get their Sauce Gardner replacement with the pick acquired in that trade with Terrell, brother of Falcons star A.J.\n\nMORE: Latest news on QBs entering NCAA transfer portal\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah (6-6, 302 pounds)\n\nThe Texans have gotten surprising returns from rookie Aireontay Ersery and the rest of their rebuilt line but should be in the market to boost pass protection and run blocking at either right tackle or guard with Fano.\n\nT.J. Parker, EDGE, Clemson (6-3, 265 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys shouldn't mind doubling up on pass-rush help here with Parker and Bailey, as Parker can provide more traditional burst and finishing moves from defensive end to help Quinnen Williams in Matt Eberflus' front four.\n\nCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State (6-3, 195 pounds)\n\nThe 49ers seem ready to cut ties with injured Brandon Aiyuk, which means they will need to find a dynamic speedy big target for Brock Purdy to better take advantage of his ace deep passing. Tate would be a natural fit with George Kittle and Jauan Jennings downfield.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 25 Heisman Trophy winners since 2000\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State (6-3, 326 pounds)\n\nThe Bills have been terrible against the run and McDonald is a natural and physically overwhelming run-stopper for the Buckeyes, shooting up boards with his dominant play fron the regular season.\n\nCaleb Banks, DT, Florida (6-6, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Chargers also could bolster their interior to help their front seven in multiple ways and Banks has the right kind of power and pop for Jesse Minter.\n\nBrandon Cisse, CB, South Carolina (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Seahawks didn't trade pending free agent Riq Woolen and will need to find their strong replacement outside to support Devon Witherpoon. Cissee can be seamless in the schme of Mike Macdonald.\n\nMORE: Picks against the spread for all 35 bowl games\n\nR Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma (6-2, 249 pounds)\n\nThe Buccaneers should covet this explosive pass-rusher built to thrive in Todd Bowles' scheme and help restore their old strength on the second level.\n\nTy Simpson, QB, Alabama (6-2, 208 pounds)s\n\nThe Steelers should be in the market for a starting QB early if Aaron Rodgers retires and Simpson's brand of pocket passing would provide plenty of promise.\n\nOlaivavega Ioane, G, Penn State (6-4, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Eagles have had issues at right guard this season and Ioane would be the easy upgrade coming from State College to Philly. sliding over from his left side position in college to start right away and upgrade over Tyler Steen.\n\nCaleb Lomu, OT, Utah (6-6, 304 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to rebuild their offensive line right up there with getting more reliable receivers and Lomu would be a good initial building block, going not long after teammate Fano.\n\nChristen Miller, DT, Georgia (6-3, 305 pounds)\n\nThe Bears need to work on their interior for Dennis Allen's front and Miller would be ideal to help them with their own run-stopping problems.\n\nKC Concepcion, WR, Texas A&M (5-11, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Patriots should love what this dynamic slot can do as the ideal fit in Josh McDaniels' offense to make big plays in the open field after the catch and upgrade over Pop Douglas and other complements to Stefon Diggs.\n\nMORE: Updated list of every college coaching change for 2026\n\nKadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama (6-7, 366 pounds)\n\nThe Rams can again think more about the near future with this second first-rounder with Proctor looking solid as their future long-term tackle on either the right or left side.\n\nC.J. Allen, LB, Georgia (6-1, 235 pounds)\n\nThe Broncos need to cover more ground defensively on the second level and Allen would provide that typical Bulldogs athlete who can get around well vs. run and in coverage.",

However, New England will need to wait for the outcome of the last two weeks, which will be determined by division opponents, to see if it can clinch the AFC East title.\n\nNew England currently has an 11-3 record, while Buffalo is at 10-4. If the Patriots win their remaining games, they will secure the AFC East title. However, after losing to Buffalo in Week 15, they lost the head-to-head tiebreaker, as the Patriots and Bills split their matchups this season.\n\nThe next tiebreaker is based on wins against division opponents. The Patriots have a 3-1 record, while the Bills are 3-2 following their loss to the Dolphins.\n\nEven if the Patriots lose to the Ravens but defeat the Jets and Dolphins, New England will still claim the AFC East title, even if the Bills win all their remaining games.\n\nPatriots-Ravens Injury Report: Lamar Jackson Among Starters Missing On Both Sides",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce entered the 2025-’26 NFL season looking to win a fourth Super Bowl with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, but it all fell apart in Week 15. In the fourth quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers, Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL. The Chiefs lost 16-13 and were eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nIt was a very disappointing season for Kansas City as the offense never found a consistent rhythm, even with Mahomes and Kelce playing really well. Following the game, the Chiefs’ tight end refused to speak to the media, citing that it wasn’t the right time.\n\nNow, Kelce has broken his silence on Mahomes’ brutal ACL injury, while sending a possible hint on his future with the Chiefs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jason and Travis Kelce released their “New Heights” podcast after Week 15. Many were waiting to hear what the Kansas City tight end was going to say about Mahomes, but they didn’t expect the possible hint about his future.\n\n“[Patrick Mahomes] is a fearless, fearless warrior when it comes to this football thing,” Kelce said. “He’s gonna make sure that he comes back stronger than ever. Hopefully, the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible. I know right now it’s kind of right around that, Week 1 or the beginning of the season next year. I know he’s going to be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs as soon as possible.”\n\nKelce’s decision to say “the Chiefs” instead of “we” has stirred up some discussion on social media that he has already made up his mind about retirement. In the midst of a tough 2025 NFL season, it is not shocking to hear that Kelce might have already made up his mind after coming off a loss in the Super Bowl.\n\nIf so, this means that Kelce has caught his final pass from Mahomes, as Gardner Minshew appears to be the starting quarterback for the rest of the NFL season. Based on Kelce’s comments, it seems like these will be his final three games in the NFL before entering retirement as well.\n\nFranciso Lindor Traded to LA Dodgers, and 4 Other Destinations Following Weird Trump Rumor\n\n‘We’re going no matter what’: Sirens dismiss Olympic rink worries\n\nAlex Bregman Free Agency Rumors Link Him to Surprise NL West Team in 2025",

    "fullText": "Jason Kelce and his younger brother, Travis Kelce, discussed the possibility of Jason coming out of retirement on the Wednesday, Dec. 17 episode of their New Heights podcast\n\nJason told Travis that he won't be returning to the Philadelphia Eagles because he has a \"loose\" bone stuck in his elbow joint that keeps him from bending his elbow\n\nJason retired from the Eagles in 2024 after 13 years in the NFL\n\nJason Kelce isn’t looking to come out of retirement anytime soon.\n\nThe 38-year-old retired NFL star hung up his cleats after 13 years with the Philadelphia Eagles in March 2024, moving on to serve as a commentator on Monday Night Countdown.\n\nOn the Wednesday, Dec. 17 episode of his and brother Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast, the subject of Jason coming out of retirement and returning to his role as a football center came up when the brothers were discussing Indianapolis Colts quarterback Philip Rivers' return to the NFL at age 44.\n\n“What other retired player should get back out there?” Travis, 36, asked, before noting, “I mean, I know a guy still trying to prove his athleticism and trying to dunk.”\n\nBut Jason quickly shut down the idea that he would come out retirement, explaining that he has a loose bone — which he calls a \"body\" — moving around his arm.\n\n“Travis, I can't bend my elbow right now. I got a loose body,” Jason said. “I can't even touch my head right now because I got a loose body stuck in my f------ elbow joint.”\n\nAccording to the University of Colorado Anschutz sports medicine department, “Loose bodies can happen in your elbow which is small pieces of bone or cartilage that have broken off and are lying or floating free within the joint. This can make it difficult to bend or rotate the joint.”\n\nTravis wasn’t interested in his older brother’s reasoning, saying, “Well, go and get that s--- cleaned out, Jason.”\n\nAnd the father of four revealed, “I'm trying to avoid surgery, Travis!”\n\nTravis wasn’t deterred adding, “We gotta get some rehab going. Are we not rehabbing?”\n\n“There's not a rehab!” Jason argued. “There's just a piece of cartilage that's floating around in there, and it's stuck in my joint. I usually, I can find it and then, like, push it out of the joint and it goes back to being fine. I can't do it right now. It's, like, stuck somewhere. I don't know if it's in the back or in the front, but it isn't leaving.”\n\nAfter Travis suggested Jason “go get an MRI” to help repair the injury, Jason gave his final word, saying, “Anyways, it's not gonna be me.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe subject of Travis’ potential retirement was not discussed during the podcast appearance, though Jason did speak on it during this week’s Monday Night Countdown.\n\n\"In my opinion, to nail that decision, you gotta step away from the game for a little bit,\" Jason said about his brother's retirement plans on Monday, Dec. 15.\n\n\"Play these last three games, enjoy them with your teammates, enjoy them with your coaches... and then let it sink in. It'll come to you with time. There are so many emotions with this game right after a season, especially with the way this one's been,\" he continued.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14, officially ending their playoff chances. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes also tore his ACL during the game, putting him out of commission for months as he recovers from surgery.",

    "description": "Tua Tagovailoa's late 2025 benching is an expensive quarterback proposition for the Dolphins in 2026 unless they can trade him in the 2026 offense.",
    "fullText": "What's next for benched Tua Tagovailoa? Dolphins QB's contract, trade options cloud NFL future originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins will be missing the AFC playoffs for a second consecutive season under Mike McDaniel. While the offensive-minded coach is trying to get off the hot seat with his team eliminated from contention at 6-8, McDaniel has benched starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for poor performance in Week 16.\n\nThe Dolphins had rallied from a 1-6 start to go 5-1 with Tagovailoa at QB, but then were crushed by the Steelers, 28-15, to end Week 15 on Monday night. Although Tagovailoa didn't play well overall in that game,  it was far from his worst outing of another disappointing season. He still threw for 253 yards with 2 TDs and an INT to post a strong 113.2 passer rating.\n\nBut beyond Tagovailoa's play, there's something that has rubbed McDaniel the wrong way. Through his 14 starts, Tagovailoa still leads the NFL with 15 interceptions, a career-high total. The timing was just right for McDaniel to dive into full evaluation mode with rookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers, who will start for the Bengals at home on Sunday.\n\nTagovailoa's benching so late says the Dolphins are desperate to cut ties with him, despite how much money he's owed and uncertainty on whether McDaniel will return in 2026. Here's why Tagovailoa's near future isn't looking so good:\n\nComplete timeline of Tua Tagovailoa's injury history\n\nInside look at Tua Tagovailoa's family tree\n\nWhere does Tua Tagovailoa rank among Alabama's greatest players ever?\n\nTua Tagovailoa's net worth, from career earnings to endorsements and more\n\nTagovailoa is playing on the second year of the four-year, $212 million contract extension, his post-rookie deal. He is owed $56 million in guaranteed money as part of his 2026 compensation. If on the Dolphins' roster next March 15, that jumps up to $3 million more guaranteed from his 2027 salary.\n\nThe Dolphins, at his contract stands without a forced restructure, are stuck taking a massive hit with the release of Tagovailoa. They stand to eat $99 million-plus in dead money, either over one or two years, with a cut in 2026.\n\nThe Dolphins would not be smart to release Tagovailoa, so they would need to think a lot more about trading himif there are no more plans to start him. Trading Tagovailoa would reduce the dead cap hit to $45.2 million with $11.2 in cap money recouped. With a designated June 1 trade, that dead cap cost would be spread over two years with $43 million saved toward the 2026 cap.\n\nMORE:Which NFL coaches are on the hot seat?\n\nTagovailoa should have some interest in the outside market. For that to happen, there will need to be a new adjusted contract down to a one-year prove-it deal. Unless McDaniel is let go, it would be difficult to see Tagovailoa playing for the Dolphins in '26.\n\nThe Raiders and Jets are the two QB-neediest teams in the NFL. Then come teams such as the Steelers, who may see Aaron Rodgers retire after one season in Pittsburgh. The Saints and Browns are not yet locked into their respective non-first-round rookies, Tyler Shough and Shedeur Sanders. The Cardinals also seem headed to having a void after moving on from Kyler Murray, but they are getting some good play from Tua's former backup, Jacoby Brissett.\n\nMORE: Tyreek Hill's cryptic social media message hints at Miami departure\n\nGoing deeper, he can be a contingency plan for the Colts and Chiefs (Daniel Jones and Patrick Mahomes injuries), Vikings (J.J. McCarthy) or Rams (Matthew Stafford successor). Then again, Jones and Marcus Mariota might have more appeal as free agents and the draft should offer at least three first-round quarterbacks.\n\nWhoever takes on Tagovailoa would be taking a shot on damaged goods at still a high price in relation to how he's played in an uber-regressive 2025 season. He's headed to needing to reboot his career as a backup, following the suit of Mariota and Jameis Winston. Unfortunately, his volatility and injury-proneness say he might be more headed the way of the next Carson Wentz, a hard-fading QB with little upside.",

    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles rumor from ESPN reveals possibility of offseason A.J. Brown trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles will have a decision to make on wide receiver A.J. Brown during the offseason.\n\nBrown is unhappy with how things have gone on offense this season and he has made that publicly known. That's something the Eagles can't love, as it draws negative attention and could create problems in the locker room.\n\nThat has led many to wonder if the Eagles could trade Brown during the offseason, and ESPN's Jeremy Fowler is hearing that it's a possibility.\n\n\"I have several candidates, but let's start with A.J. Brown. The weekly concerns about Brown's messaging — from sonnets to soundbites — must be taxing on Philadelphia's locker room, even if players understand the receiver's frustration due to the limitations of the Eagles' passing attack,\" Fowler said. \"Several executives I spoke to believe the Eagles could look to move Brown, who's 28 and still has prime years left.\"\n\nAccording to Over The Cap, the Eagles would incur a $43.4 million dead cap hit in 2026 if they trade Brown before June 1. The post-June 1 trade number is more palatable at $16.3 million.\n\nIs it worth jettisoning Brown and taking on that dead cap hit in order to not have him on the team and complaining publicly anymore?\n\nWe would say no, especially with the Eagles having a huge hole to fill in their offense if they do trade him, but never say never in the NFL.\n\nAs far as compensation is concerned, we could see Philly getting a first-round pick for Brown's services, but no worse than a second-rounder.\n\nWith that pick, combined with the eight projected selections the Eagles have, they will have ample opportunity to add a replacement for Brown to pair with DeVonta Smith, who will turn into Philly's No. 1 if Brown gets traded.\n\nWe've seen the Eagles bite the bullet with dead money to unload one of their players before, so we shouldn't rule out the same happening with Brown.\n\nRaiders rumor details Las Vegas' likely exit strategy with Pete Carroll\n\nJerry Jones highly critical of Matt Eberflus, making his seat even hotter\n\nDetails behind Jets' problems with Allen Lazard revealed after WR's release\n\nZac Taylor, Duke Tobin get Bengals job security update from beat writer",
