    "fullText": "Every offseason brings speculation, projection models, and plenty of debate — but nothing captures long-range anticipation quite like the way-too-early MVP odds. Before a single snap of the season is played, sportsbooks and analysts are already trying to forecast which superstar will dominate the narrative across the NFL landscape in 2026. These early numbers don’t just reflect talent — they reflect team trajectory, offensive stability, durability, and the ever-important storylines that shape voter perception.\n\nAt the front of the conversation are familiar faces who’ve already proven they can carry franchises and command national attention. Josh Allen remains a perennial contender because of his rare blend of physicality and high-volume production. Lamar Jackson continues to redefine quarterback play with explosive dual-threat impact that can reshape games week to week. Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes is almost permanently positioned in MVP discussions simply because excellence has become routine.\n\nJust behind them sit elite passers still chasing that defining MVP season. Justin Herbert possesses statistical upside that could translate into award recognition if team success follows. And Joe Burrow continues to build a résumé centered on precision, composure, and winning in high-leverage moments.\n\nOf course, “way too early” is the operative phrase. Injuries, breakout stars, coaching changes, and unexpected team surges will inevitably reshape the race. But right now, these odds offer a snapshot of who the football world expects to define the 2026 season — and whose performance could ultimately shape the league’s competitive hierarchy.\n\nOdds: +550\nAllen’s MVP case always starts with his physical dominance — few quarterbacks can stress defenses as both a power runner and vertical passer the way he does. If his efficiency stabilizes late in the season and turnover swings tighten up, he becomes incredibly hard to beat in voting. A top seed paired with highlight-reel production would make him the clear betting favorite.\n\nOdds: +650\nJackson’s ceiling is still unmatched when his rushing explosiveness and passing rhythm peak at the same time. Voters tend to reward his dual-threat dominance when his offense is built around his improvisational strengths. Another season where he controls tempo and stays healthy deep into January would put him squarely in the MVP spotlight again.\n\nOdds: +1000\nMahomes is almost permanently in the MVP conversation because of how consistently he elevates his offense regardless of surrounding personnel. If his statistical output rebounds into league-leading territory while maintaining elite situational play, the narrative momentum quickly returns. He’s the classic “never count him out” candidate when big moments pile up.\n\nOdds: +1000\nHerbert’s MVP path hinges on translating elite arm talent into sustained team success over a full season. When his deep passing and high-volume production align with efficient red-zone execution, his numbers look historic. A breakout year in the win column could finally convert his statistical brilliance into major award recognition.\n\nOdds: +1000\nBurrow’s candidacy thrives on precision, timing, and leadership in high-leverage moments. When his offense operates at peak efficiency and he controls games late, voters tend to gravitate toward his poised style. If he combines elite passing totals with another deep playoff push narrative, his MVP momentum can surge quickly.\n\nEarly MVP odds are less prediction and more temperature check — a reflection of reputation, momentum, and projected opportunity. They highlight who the league believes will matter most before the season even begins. And while the eventual winner often emerges from unexpected circumstances, these early favorites set the stage for the narratives, rivalries, and performances that will define the 2026 MVP race.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Way too early NFL MVP odds for 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce made a cheeky reference to his fiancée Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The Kelce brothers showcased their creativity for Valentine’s Day by making cheeky, punny cards. The Chiefs’ tight end made sweet references to Jumanji, his NFL career, and even Swift’s sourdough obsession. However, fans were impressed by Kelce’s witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood” in one of the creatives shared via an Instagram carousel.\n\nTravis Kelce referenced Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The New Heights podcast’s official Instagram account shared a carousel showcasing their wholesome Valentine’s Day greetings. The first slide in the carousel read, “Wood you be my Valentine?” accompanied by an animated tree and Kelce smiling.\n\nFor those who missed it, this is a reference to Swift’s raunchy track “Wood” from her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl. Notably, the global pop star has dedicated the song to her fiancé. The lyrics make a cheeky reference to Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, and his manhood as well. Swift sings, “New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood) / I ain’t gotta knock on wood” (via Page Six).\n\nFans are loving Kelce’s sweet tribute to Swift and lavished praise in the comments section. One fan commented, “Y’all had the opportunity to do the funniest thing and you did! Good job!!!” A second fan wrote, “These are too good,” accompanied by a laughing emoji. A third fan penned, “WOOD YOU BE MY VALENTINE HAHAHAHAHAH 13/13,” accompanied by clapping emojis. Finally, one fan remarked, “The wood one is my fav.”\n\nFans joked that Kelce is redeeming himself after previously not understanding a witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood.” During the Wednesday, January 21, episode of New Heights, Kelce joked that “Taylor’s gonna kill me” for missing a clear reference to Swift’s song “Wood.”\n\nThe post Travis Kelce’s Valentine’s Day Card Comes With Taylor Swift Twist appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "description": "NFL general managers will have to be creative in coming up with trades this offseason.",
    "fullText": "Player trades in the NFL have become more common in recent years, and one NFL insider believes the trend will continue this offseason.\n\nOn a recent episode of “The Adam Schefter Podcast,” the ESPN NFL reporter said it may be tougher for teams to get impact players this season through traditional means, meaning teams will likely be involved in more trades.\n\n“When we talk about the draft, and we’ll see how it shakes out over time, people aren’t all that excited about the draft,” Schefter said. “We got a free-agent class that’s not really deep. We’ve got a draft that is not considered really deep. You know what that tells me? More trades. That’s what it tells me. It tells me we may get more wheeling and dealing in trades than we’ve had in other years.”\n\nSchefter added that although he has not heard any specific trades that are brewing, he sees the activity around the Nov. 4 trade deadline as an indication of teams willing to make more deals to fix their rosters.\n\nThe trade market could be utilized by teams to acquire quarterbacks. This year’s quarterback draft class is not projected to be as strong as recent years, with Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza expected to go as the first overall pick and Alabama’s Ty Simpson appearing to be the only other quarterback projected as a first-round selection.\n\nKyler Murray (Arizona Cardinals) and Mac Jones (San Francisco 49ers) are expected to be the top targets on the trade market, with Raiders quarterback Geno Smith also expected to garner interest.\n\nOn the defensive side, Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby could be another player moved, although it has been previously reported that a deal for him could come after he finishes recovering from a knee injury he suffered late last season.",

    "title": "2026 NFL mock draft tracker: 40 mocks, 21 prospects for Dallas Cowboys",
    "description": "There are so many mock drafts.",
    "fullText": "At the end of January, we published our first mock draft database of the season. At the time, 21 of the 25 mocks (84%) were projecting the Cowboys to take a linebacker, with Sonny Styles (17 mocks, 68%) the clear favorite. The second most popular position was cornerback with 15 picks (60%), followed by edge rushers with 11 picks (44%). The early consensus seemed to be LB Sonny Styles with the 12th pick and a CB with the 20th pick, a combo offered by 10 of the 25 mocks or 40% of the time.\n\nBut a lot has happened since then: The Super Bowl came and went, this year’s salary cap was announced, the Senior Bowl is behind us, and the Cowboys look to have completed their coaching hires, so it’s again time to turn our attention to the very serious business of mock drafting.\n\nOn the hypothesis that the predictive value of multiple mock drafts is greater than that of a single mock, we are taking a survey of 40 different mock drafts today. Importantly, all 40 mocks were published on or after February 1st, giving us a big data set of the latest mock drafts. And here are all those 40 mocks, and which two players they have the Cowboys selecting.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nThat’s a ton of info to digest, with 21 different prospects mocked to the Cowboys somewhere in the first round, so let’s look at a few more digestible extracts from this exercise, starting with how this round of mocks compares to the last one.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nMock Draft distribution by Player Posiition\n\nWhat we see here is a shift away from linebackers to edge rushers, plus a strong increase in “other positions” that didn’t get much attention in January. Naturally, this produces some “winners and losers” among the players mocked to Dallas:\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nMock Draft distribution by Player Posiition\n\nSonny Styles still remains the consensus favorite for the Cowboys, but his lead over other prospects has dropped. At cornerback, the attention in the mock drafts shifted towards the top two guys in this draft class, Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy at the expense of the other corners in this class. At edge, the Cowboys are completely out of the Rueben Bain and David Bailey sweepstakes, but Cashius Howell and T.J. Parker are new names popping up in the mocks. Safety is getting some mock interest, but having Caleb Downs dropping all the way to No. 12 seems more like a pipe dream than anything else at the moment. But keep an eye on Emmanuel McNeill-Warren, he’s been getting increasing interest lately. Also, why anybody would have the Cowboys invest their No. 12 pick in a WR, RB, or DT is completely beyond me.\n\nBut all of that doesn’t yet tell us too much about how the first round could play out for the Cowboys. For that, I plotted where seven specific players were taken in each of the 50 mocks. Those seven players are:\n\nThe top safety, and maybe the best player in the draft, Caleb Downs\n\nThe consensus top pick from the 40 mocks, Sonny Styles\n\nThe top six edge rushers in the 40 mocks\n\nThe top four corners mocked to the Cowboys\n\nHere’s how often each player was taken at which spot in the 50 mocks:\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\n40 Mock Drafts – Summary Results\n\nThis table illustrates how the first round could likely play out for the Cowboys and the prospects they are interested in. One of the top two pass rushers, Bain or Bailey, is headed to Tennessee (#4) with the other one likely going to Washington (#7). Caleb Downs is a top 10 pick, and has a hard stop at Cincinnati (#10), though there is a slim chance he could fall to the Cowboys.\n\nLB Sonny Styles could be a consideration for Washington at #7, but they should happily bite on one of the falling pass rushers, so there’s a 70% (28 of 40 mocks) chance he’ll be available at #12 for the Cowboys. Barring Caleb Downs falling to them (12.5% chance), the Cowboys should have the option of picking between Styles (70%) or cornerbacks Mansoor Delane (37.5%) or Jermod McCoy (50%). Which of the two corners fall depends on what Miami does at #11.\n\nThe mocks seem to agree, for now, that pass rusher is the likely pick at #20 for the Cowboys, and depending on which player the Cowboys have their eyes on, they might even consider trading down from the 20th spot if they can find a team interested in moving up.\n\nOverall, that leaves the Cowboys with a lot of options, and if you boil it down to position combinations, here are the most frequent combinations among the 40 mocks:\n\nTo get a little more clarity on which player could be available for the Cowboys, you can look up the player ranking on your favorite big board, you can make up your own ranking, and you could even use a consensus big board to figure out such a ranking.\n\nOr we could look at the average draft position for each player based on the 40 mocks above, which is exactly what you’ll see in the table below. I included all LBs, CBs, edge rushers and safeties that were mocked to the Cowboys at least once, and added four more players to round things out (LB Arvell Reese, DE Rueben Bain, DE David Bailey, CB Avieon Terrell). To arrive at the average rank, I calculated the average across the 40 mocks, and where a player fell out of the Top 32, I used the 33th spot to calculate the average draft position.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nWithin the confines of this 40-mock data set, that gives the Cowboys plenty of options, with the big caveat that it’s still a long way to go to the draft.\n\nWhat would be your choice right now, based on these 40 mocks and the 21 prospects mocked to the Cowboys?",

However, then Illinois defensive backs coach Aaron Henry immediately saw something in him that others missed. “I really believe the Good Lord just creates people who are a little bit different, I saw that the first day I got to campus.

Based on their play in the regular season and playoffs, he then listed those quarterbacks from 1 to 63, placing them in tiers.\n\nMaking a big jump and landing in Tier 2 was Daniel Jones. For more on Jones' ranking and why Shook placed him there, you can find that here.\n\nBut what about Phillip Rivers and Riley Leonard?\n\nRivers came in at No. 36 and in Tier 5. A few others in this category included Kyler Murray, Joe Flacco, Spencer Rattler, and others.\n\n\"The 44-year-old proved he could still succeed with his brain; his arm, however, showed his age,\" Shook wrote.\n\nIn his three games, Rivers completed 63% of his passes for 544 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nThe Colts, unfortunately, did not win any of those games, but Rivers routinely put the offense into favorable looks pre-snap and helped that unit sustain drives and hang around in games, giving Indianapolis a chance.\n\nThe Colts needed stability at quarterback, and Rivers was able to provide that.\n\nLeonard, meanwhile, came in at No. 47 in these rankings and in Tier 6. Carson Wentz, Shedeur Sanders, Russell Wilson, and others were in this tier.\n\n\"Riley Leonard made one start and was shockingly effective, slinging the ball around the yard as if there was no tomorrow in a high-scoring loss to Houston,\" Shook wrote.\n\nAs Shook said, Leonard's start against Houston -- a very good defense -- in Week 18 was quite good. He completed 21-of-34 passes for 270 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.\n\nIt wasn't perfect by any means, but Leonard always found a way to respond. Could he be the Colts' backup quarterback in 2026?\n\nAnthony Richardson would appear in a couple of games before being placed on IR, but did not make any starts. So he did not qualify for Shook's rankings.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Every starting QB from 2025 ranked: Where do Colts QBs land?",

    "description": "Six quarterback prospects that the Packers could target in the 2026 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "In the last three drafts, Brian Gutekunst has selected two quarterbacks on Day 3. The Green Bay Packers general manager drafted Sean Clifford in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft and Michael Pratt in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nWith Jordan Love's backup, Malik Willis set to hit the open market and fetch a big payday, the Packers could be in the market to invest another Day 3 pick as they look to find a new backup for Love.\n\nLet's dive into some Day 3 quarterbacks who could be targets for the Packers during the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe winningest quarterback in college football history started his collegiate career at South Dakota State University, where he helped guide the Jackrabbits to two national championships. He has that \"it\" factor and he's not going to sink the ship. He'd keep Green Bay’s offense on track if he were forced into action. Much like Willis, the former SDSU quarterback can do damage with his legs. This past season at Iowa, he picked up 49 first downs with his legs. During his time in Brookings, he picked up 146 first downs on the ground and also had 60 runs of 10-plus yards.\n\nMark Gronowski is tough as nails. Tweaks his shoulder and still punches in the rushing touchdown to put Iowa up 24-16 at the half against Nebraska. pic.twitter.com/8f8Vn3tQJi\n\n— KCRG Sports (@KCRG_Sports) November 28, 2025\n\nPayton helped guide the Bison to a national championship during his first season as a starter. The southpaw quarterback threw for 2,719 yards and 16 touchdowns. Payton added 777 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. A former baseball player, Payton has the arm strength to rip throws into tight windows. He's able to navigate the rush and make accurate throws on the move. He has good acceleration when he gets outside the pocket and runs with the determination of a running back.\n\nNDSU QB Cole Payton is one of those draft, stash, & “develop” QB prospects you take mid draft. \n\nCrazy throw right here lol. Multiple reasons to buy in and see what you can mold him into. pic.twitter.com/RYnL21qVyW\n\n— Damian Parson💰 (@DP_NFL) February 6, 2026\n\nMrton has a quick setup and gets the ball out quickly. He sees the field well and understands where his outlets are. He's athletic in the pocket and comfortable making throws outside the pocket. He's got good zip on short and intermediate throws and shows good accuracy. Over the past two seasons, Morton threw for 5,900 yards and 47 touchdowns.\n\nBehren Morton is a productive and multi-faceted QB with elastic arm action, placing among nations leaders in categories of both efficiency and explosiveness@BehrenMorton also sits among the top of @TexasTechFB record books for career passing yds + total offense #WreckEm https://t.co/JHBsJ9lQ8t pic.twitter.com/cGLixeoPrd\n\n— Shane Coughlin (@Shane__Coughlin) January 10, 2026\n\nThe transfer from Boise State, Green passed for 5,868 yards and 34 touchdowns during his two seasons at Arkansas. Standing at 6-6 and 229 pounds, Green looks good off the bus and he has a rocket for an arm. Now it will be up to an NFL coaching staff to harness that natural arm strength and help him spray the ball accurately all over the field. Green can do damage with his legs, rushing for 1,379 yards and 16 touchdowns during his two seasons with the Razorbacks.\n\nA Texas native, Robertson started his collegiate career at Mississippi State before transferring to Baylor. This past season, Robertson threw for 3,681 yards and 31 touchdowns. He's a natural gunslinger with easy-looking arm talent. He has a quick reaction to get the ball out and on time.\n\nUSD's all-time leader in passing yards and completions is going to impress teams when he gets in front of them. He's a leader and an impressive individual off the field. At 6-5, 225 pounds, the USD quarterback is well built. He finished this past season with 2,876 yards and 26 touchdowns. The Minnesota native and Iowa State transfer has ties to Green Bay. Bouman's father, Todd Bouman, a long-time backup NFL quarterback, spent a minute with the Packers in 2006 as the team's backup quarterback after Aaron Rodgers got injured.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: 6 QB targets for Packers on Day 3 of 2026 NFL Draft",

    "description": "Could the Cowboys look to trade UP in the 2026 NFL Draft?",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NFL Draft quickly approaching, mock drafts and draft conversation are at their peak. For the Dallas Cowboys, who currently do not own a day two pick in the draft, many fans and analysts are looking at potential trade back scenarios from the 12th or 20th overall pick to pickup an additional second- or third-round pick on day two.\n\nBut Zach Wolchuk of 105.3 The Fan asked an interesting question on Twitter on Thursday that got the brain spinning. Could the Cowboys use their two first-round picks this year to move up in the draft, while also picking up a day two pick with their trade partner?\n\nIn Wolchuk’s scenario, he asked if people would be okay trading the 12th and 20th overall pick to the Cleveland Browns for the 6th and 39th overall pick? In most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent. But in this draft class that is substantially weaker than most, first round grades will likely max out at around 14. So realistically, the player the Cowboys would be drafting at 20 will more than likely have a second-round grade. If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nIn most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent.

If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nDallas trades the 12th and 20th (616 value points) overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft to Cleveland for the 6th and 39th (599 value points) overall pick. Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the sixth overall pick and edge rusher R Mason Thomas with the 39th overall pick.\n\nDallas trades the 12th, 20th, and 215th overall pick (617 value points) to the New Orleans for the 8th, 42nd, 73rd, and 189th (618 value points) overall pick. Using Pro Football Focus’ draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the eighth overall pick, cornerback Colton Hood with the 42nd overall pick, and linebacker Jacob Rodriguez with the 73rd overall pick.\n\nDallas offers the 12th, 20th, and 150th overall pick (629 value points) to Kansas City for the 9th and 74th overall pick and cornerback Trent McDuffie (619 value points). Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. with the ninth overall pick and safety Kamari Ramsey with the 74th overall pick.\n\nWith both the New York Giants and Washington Commanders picking inside the top 10 and unlikely to hand their divisional rival a blue chip talent, that leaves just a handful of spots that make sense for the Cowboys to consider. Given the value it would take to move into the top five, th Cowboys only have a few options to consider, but those couple options could give the Cowboys a chance at a player they would not be able to consider at 12, while also landing a quality player on day two and/or three.\n\nThere are only a few players likely to motivate the Cowboys to trade up in this draft. Ohio State safety Caleb Downs being one. Miami edge rusher Reuben Bain Jr. being one. But players like Texas Tech edge rusher David Bailey, LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane, and Ohio State linebacker Sonny Styles are also a few names to consider in this exercise.",

    "fullText": "Another NFL insider has connected the Indianapolis Colts to free agent defensive end Trey Hendrickson.\n\nThe NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe recently shared what he is hearing about Trey Hendrickson and the Cincinnati Bengals, and mentioned as a team to watch were the Colts.\n\n\"From what I understand, a team source told me, he figures it's unlikely for these two sides (Hendrickson and the Bengals) to reunite going into next season,\" Wolfe said. \"And so what does that mean? Do the Bengals let him go in free agency? Do they try to slap the franchise tag on him and trade him? A difficult decision for Cincy because their relationship has not been great in recent weeks.\n\nWolfe continued, \"And I'm told that if this deal does end up happening, free agency-wise, keep an eye on the Indianapolis Colts. It's a team that wants to be aggressive; they made the big splash move for Sauce Gardner mid-season. Lou Anarumo has a lot of familiarity with Trey Hendrickson. They just hired a D-line coach named Marion Hobby, who coached Trey Hendrickson for four years in Cincinnati.\n\n\"When they were all together, Lou, Marion, and Trey Hendrickson, they had 57 sacks in four seasons. Four Pro Bowl seasons. They're going to be aggressive in trying to get him if he does reach the market, or even if it's a sign and trade. It could be a big splash move for the Indianapolis Colts.\"\n\nTHE WOLFE OF BALL STREET: EARLY OFF-SEASON PREVIEW\n\n- Why Travis Hunter offense vs. defense usage will change a lot in 2026\n- Keep an eye on Trey Hendrickson and Indianapolis Colts\n- Browns could go with Shedeur Sanders and/or Deshaun Watson at QB, pass on drafting QB high again pic.twitter.com/1pQ60wmKm3\n\n— Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) February 14, 2026\n\nAs Wolfe alluded to with all the connections he made between the Colts and Hendrickson, Indianapolis' interest doesn't come as much of a surprise.\n\nFor one, more pass-rush help is needed. The Colts need to bolster their defensive end depth this offseason and need more pass-rush juice from that position group.\n\nIn addition to that, he will be very familiar with Lou Anarumo's defensive scheme after spending several seasons playing for him while the two were with the Bengals. Hendrickson's most productive seasons came with Anarumo as his defensive coordinator.\n\nAnd of note, the Colts have reportedly expressed interest in Hendrickson previously. Last offseason, when the Bengals were potentially trading Hendrickson, the Colts reportedly called Cincinnati to check in.\n\nAfter GM Chris Ballard was more aggressive in free agency last offseason, it sounds like the Colts plan to take a similar approach this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts free agency: Indianapolis again connected to Trey Hendrickson",

    "description": "George Pickens' future is up in the air at the time of writing, and that lends itself to all sorts of scenarios that could potentially play out.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys and George Pickens are getting set for a big offseason of contract talks, and you can bet it won't be smooth sailing.\n\nWith the Cowboys set to franchise Pickens, just as our own Mike Fisher reported back on November 27, that has led some to think the franchise could look to trade the Pro Bowl receiver and get something in return.\n\nIn truth, trading Pickens doesn't seem like a move that winning football teams make, and one could only imagine the backlash if the Cowboys trade Micah Parsons and then Pickens in back-to-back offseasons.\n\nAt the time of writing, we don't get the sense that Dallas wants to trade George, with Fish stating that some sections of people inside The Star would have an aneurysm if that were to happen.\n\nSo that tells you what the franchise thinks of Pickens.\n\nIt is here where NFL Network's Ian Rapoport offers his thoughts on what might entice Dallas to trade Pickens.\n\n“They’re going to franchise tag him, I just wonder what happens next,” Rapoport said. “He had a breakout year. These are the guys you don't let walk in free agency, and he's been great. What I really don't know is, are the Cowboys going to get an offer for Pickens that would allow them to trade him?\n\"They acquired him for a three, what if they franchise-tagged [Pickens], he gets the long-term deal that he wants, and they [Cowboys] get a two back? That's incredible value. I wonder if that's something that would be palatable for the Cowboys.\"\n\nIf I were Dallas' general manager, a second-round pick would not be enough for me to move on from Pickens. In truth, given what we saw George do, not only for the offense as a whole, but for individual players, I'm not sure I'm letting him go at all. Barring a godfather-like offer, of course.\n\nInstead, use the cap space and draft picks to rebuild the defense, while keeping the offense together.\n\nThis isn't the first time we have heard Dallas trading Pickens and getting a second-round pick back, and one thing we know about Rapoport is that he doesn't say things for the sake of it.\n\nSo there might be some merit to his line of thinking. He got that from somewhere.\n\nHow Jerry Jones approaches Pickens' contract will tell us a lot about where the owner's mind is regarding building a roster capable of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nThe offense with Pickens is more than capable of winning it all. It just needs a defense that can complement it.\n\nIf you trade away Pickens, you lose a huge part of what makes your offense great.\n\nAnd in the process, might throw away a chance at finally making that NFC Championship game.",

The 42-year-old entered 2025 on a one-year deal with the intention of it being his final season. However, he kept the door open to return in 2026, and now the Steelers await his decision.\n\nIn terms of his performance in 2025, Rodgers threw 24 touchdowns to just seven interceptions and led the Steelers to an AFC North championship. It’s because of that year-long outing that Nick Shook of NFL Media ranked Rodgers as the No. 16 quarterback amongst all 63 to start a game in 2025.\n\n“Aaron Rodgers bested Father Time for much of 2025 and is the primary reason the Steelers even reached the playoffs,” Shook writes. “He produced some of his best games of the last three or four years and can definitely still fill a starting job somewhere in this league if he wants it.”\n\nRodgers was sandwiched between Brock Purdy (No. 15) and Baker Mayfield (No. 17).\n\nShould Rodgers return, he would reunite with his former head coach in Green Bay, Mike McCarthy.\n\nLet us know what you think in the comments. Be sure to bookmark Behind the Steel Curtain for all the latest news, breakdowns, and more!\n\nMason Rudolph sides with Joey Porter on Big Ben comments\n\nAntonio Brown defends Ben Roethlisberger after Joey Porter comments\n\nCam Heyward ends retirement speculation\n\nJoey Porter calls out Ben Roethlisberger for being a bad teammate",

He also expects his tight ends to be versatile so that he can line them up anywhere on the field.\n\nIn 2025, the Bears used the sixth-highest percentage of 12 personnel (1 running back, 2 tight ends) in the NFL and the fifth-highest percentage of 13 personnel.\n\nJohnson’s offense will continue to evolve schematically, but I can’t see Ben deviating too far from his use of tight ends, which makes this an important position that needs quality depth.\n\nHere’s how the Bears’ tight end room currently shapes up.\n\nColston Loveland – Signed through 2028* – Loveland was one of the most dynamic rookies in the NFL, and this was after a slow start to the season. He flashed elite traits and appears primed to push for the Pro Bowl next season. His athleticism makes him a perfect “move” tight end, but he didn’t seem to mind lining up as the Y and blocking either. It’s easy to see why the Bears valued his skill set at 10 overall in the draft, and why his ceiling is even higher than that of a perennial Pro Bowler.\n\n*Bears have the fifth-year option for 2029.\n\nCole Kmet – Signed through 2027 – The Bears could save about $8 million if they move on from Kmet, but I think it’s more likely they rework his deal and sign him to an extension. Kmet has become a reliable in-line blocker, but he’s athletic enough to line up wide or in the backfield. He’ll likely never approach the 73 receptions he had in 2023, but he plays an important role in Johnson’s offense.\n\nLoveland and Kmet make up one of the best tight end duos in the NFL.\n\nDurham Smythe – Free agent – The 30-year-old veteran played in a quarter of the Bears’ offensive snaps (293) and the sixth-most snaps on special teams (230). I can see the Bears bringing him back on another one-year deal.\n\nThe next three players spent time on Chicago’s practice squad in 2025 and signed reserve/futures contracts.\n\nStephen Carlson – Signed through 2026 – Carlson has been with the Bears since 2023, but he’s only appeared in three games. He’s a solid veteran option to call up from the practice squad, but at 29 years old, he’s probably never going to crack a 53-man roster.\n\nNikola Kalinic – Signed through 2026 – The 29-year-old began his career in the CFL in 2019, and the Bears are his fourth NFL team since 2022. He played in two games for the Bears in 2025, making 3 special teams tackles.\n\nQadir Ismail – Signed through 2026 – The Bears are his fifth NFL team since being a Ravens UDFA in 2024. At 6’6”, 232 pounds, he’s a good athlete who started his collegiate career as a quarterback for Villanova and finished it as a wide receiver for Samford. His dad, Qadry, was a ten-year veteran in the NFL.\n\n2026 OUTLOOK – Assuming Kmet stays, the Bears won’t be addressing this position with big money in free agency or a high draft pick. However, some bottom of the depth chart competition should come from a UDFA or two.\n\nWhat do you think will happen at tight end this offseason?",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The sports media is ignoring the story, but wealthy sports figures are all over the Epstein files.\n\nChild sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein did not want to ingratiate himself only to billionaires. He wanted to spend time with people who shaped the culture, and as we saw during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show, nothing shapes the culture quite like the athletic industrial complex.\n\nThe website Front Office Sports went through the latest tranche of hurriedly redacted Epstein files, and it is shocking just how many NFL franchise owners are in these e-mails and assorted documents. They include—and this is a partial list—Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots; Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants and first cousin of Jessica Tisch, the current New York City police commissioner; Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins; Zygi Wilf, owner of the Minnesota Vikings; and Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons. There are more NFL owners in the Epstein files than attended the Super Bowl.\n\nDenials have already been sputtered, and the owners’ public relations machines are working in overdrive to deny that they are anything more than incidental acquaintances of Epstein. But how many were actually friends with Epstein is less relevant than the fact that everyone who associated with Epstein ignored and excused what was often happening in plain sight around them. And as hard as their PR mavens are working to deflect attention, the sports media is working just as hard to ignore it all.\n\nAfter all, who could possibly imagine that Kraft would be involved in anything illicit when it comes to exercising power over young women? ESPN has essentially not covered the sports figures involved with Epstein. There are scant few articles under the byline “ESPN News Services,” which draws from the Associated Press. There has been no investigative journalism or televised commentary on one of their yak-fests. When one considers that the NFL now owns a portion of ESPN, not to mention that the NFL is central to much of its programming, the network’s blasé attitude toward the story is odious.\n\nEven more damning in the released files is the repeated presence of LA 2028 Olympic chairman Casey Wasserman. He says he did nothing wrong, though two Los Angeles supervisors and two members of the City Council have now called for him to resign from his role with the Olympic organizing committee. LA City Council member Monica Rodriguez said that Wasserman represents “a threat to the integrity of the games.”\n\nWassermans’s clients are already leaving his talent agency in protest. Olympian Abby Wambach and popstar Chappell Roan have dropped Wasserman and are calling for him to step down from the agency that bears his name.\n\nOf course, by any moral marker, Wasserman should not be allowed within 500 yards of the Olympics (or a school). His e-mails to Epstein’s partner in child trafficking, Ghislaine Maxwell, date back 20 years and include unredacted tidbits like, “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” LA Mayor Karen Bass, however, has not joined the call for him to disappear from the 2028 Games, already being called “The Epstein Olympics.”\n\nThe unconvincing excuses for keeping Wasserman at his post include the difficulty of replacing the chair of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee at this late of a date, as well as his ability to raise corporate cash. After what the organizing committee described as an “internal investigation,” Wasserman, whose grandfather Lew Wasserman was one of Hollywood’s most powerful people, is staying on as chair. We need to fight to see every page of the Epstein files with only the names of the survivors and victims redacted—but that is not enough. To paraphrase journalist Nolan Higdon, it is becoming more and more difficult to “shield the architects of the second Gilded Age”—and they deserve no such protections.\n\nThe Epstein files have exposed that global elites have never been wealthier and more influential, but they’ve become drunk on power after decades of plunder. This second Gilded Age isn’t ending until the exposure is total and its criminal offenders are frog-marched out of the owners’ boxes.",

According to a report from ESPN, Cannon later admitted to counterfeiting in the 1980s after a series of bad investments and debts left him penniless.\n\nHe served two years in a Texarkana prison.

    "description": "Two NFL draft analysts have some good news for the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "Two of the best NFL draft analysts in the business, Daniel Jeremiah and Jordan Reid, have some good news for the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nAddressing cornerback and edge rusher are likely two items fairly high up on GM James Gladstone's offseason to-do list, and this year's draft class has a lot of talent at those positions.\n\nOn the edge rusher position, Jeremiah had this to say: \"If you need an edge rusher, this is a good draft to double up. The depth of the class is impressive. I've got 10 guys worthy of a spot in top 50 players. There's another layer of traitsy players beyond that group.\"\n\nThe Jaguars are positioned well here with Josh Hines-Allen and Travon Walker, but depth is a need. Beyond those two, the only other defensive ends under contract as of now are Danny Striggow and BJ Green.\n\nJacksonville could also use more steady pass-rush production from the rotational members of their defensive front.\n\nHere are the top 10 defensive ends in this year's draft from Mel Kiper's big board:\n\n1. Rueben Bain Jr., Miami (Fla.)2. Keldric Faulk, Auburn3. Zion Young, Missouri4. Akheem Mesidor, Miami (Fla.)5. Dani Dennis-Sutton, Penn State6. Caden Curry, Ohio State7. LT Overton, Alabama8. Jack Pyburn, LSU9. Max Llewellyn, Iowa10. Vincent Anthony Jr., Duke\n\nReid then had this to say about the cornerback and safety positions: \"This is a fantastic DB class. I have a huge cluster of 2nd and 3rd round grades at both safety and CB right now. The testing and on-field drills will be fun to watch at the Combine. Interested to see who separates from the group.\"\n\nAt cornerback, the Jaguars still have Jourdan Lewis, Jarrian Jones, and Travis Hunter, but Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome are free agents.\n\nThe level of need that Jacksonville has at this position will be dependent on what happens in free agency with Brown and Newsome, or whether an outside addition is made.\n\nSafety is less of a need, but perhaps is still a position that Gladstone could add to. Andrew Wingard is set to be a free agent, but on the roster are Eric Murray, Antonio Johnson, Caleb Ransaw, and Rayuan Lane.\n\nHere are Kiper's top cornerbacks in this year's draft:\n\n1. Jermod McCoy, Tennessee2. Mansoor Delane, LSU3. Avieon Terrell, Clemson4. Brandon Cisse, South Carolina5. Colton Hood, Tennessee6. D'Angelo Ponds, Indiana7. Chris Johnson, San Diego State8. Julian Neal, Arkansas9. Chandler Rivers, Duke10. Keionte Scott, Miami (Fla.)\n\nThe Jaguars do not have a first-round pick this year, but Jacksonville owns 11 picks in total, including four in the top 100. So the opportunity to address both edge rusher and cornerback with early-round picks does exist.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Lots of talent for Jaguars at 2 key positions of need",

He will join a large ownership group that includes former NFL running back Marshawn Lynch, Golden State Warriors guard Gary Payton II, Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd and musician Billie Joe Armstrong, lead singer of Green Day, which performed before Super Bowl 60 last Sunday.\n\n“Bringing my business acumen and sports fandom together as part of the Oakland Roots and Soul ownership group is truly special,” E-40 said in a statement. “This move is about investing in a sport that connects the world. I look forward to working closely with the ownership team to continue to amplify the fan experience while delivering successful results on the field.”\n\nE-40 will perform at the Oakland Roots season opener against New Mexico United on March 14 in the USL Championship. The Soul plays in the USL W League.\n\nHe’s often seen at sporting events in the Bay Area. E-40 has been spotted courtside at Golden State Warriors games, and he is a vocal San Francisco 49ers supporter. He created the song “Niner Gang,” which derives from the popular saying for their fans, “Bang, bang, Niner Gang.” When the San Francisco Giants were making World Series runs in the early 2010s, E-40 attended home games and traveled to road games to support. He was also the featured performer when the Cal Golden Bears football team held “Bay Appreciation Day” in 2024.\n\nE-40, a Vallejo, Calif., native, was honored by the city in October 2023. The city had a one-mile stretch of Magazine Street renamed “E-40 Way.”\n\nWith the Warriors back in San Francisco, the Raiders now in Las Vegas and the Oakland A’s now playing in West Sacramento, the soccer clubs have emerged as a source of pride and new alternatives for pro sports in Oakland. They’ve also been a leader in celebrating town culture and community.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSan Francisco Giants, Soccer, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

However, a trading party takes on $34M this season in salary–unless Arizona takes on some of that salary.\n\nThen there is also the idea of compensation. That $34M figure will likely influence trade compensation. If the Cardinals were to eat some of that money, it could reasonably be expected that they would get a better return in a trade.\n\nMORE: George Kittle sends message to 49ers, NFL over wild conspiracy theory\n\nThe Cardinals want to get this done quickly, as Murray’s base salary becomes guaranteed four days after the 2026 new league year date. They could potentially post-June 1 release him, but that would leave no return.\n\nMurray has been linked to multiple teams, including the Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, and even the Cleveland Browns. The Colts are uncertain of Daniel Jones’ recovery timeline, the Jets will likely move on from Fields, and the Browns are always looking for a quarterback.\n\nOne thing feels almost certain: Murray will be in a different uniform only a few years after signing a hefty contract extension.

However, Jacksonville's ability to get steady contributions from Day 3 picks and UDFAs is a good sign for the future, Gladstone said, and the strong processes that Jacksonville has in place.\n\n\"At this point, there's plenty of room for optimism,\" Gladstone said of the draft class.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: Jaguars 2025 draft class receives lackluster grade from analyst",

Always grateful I was able to be a part of this team and system,” tweeted the former New Orleans Saint.\n\n“We showed the NFL how valuable a TE truly can be when he’s used as a matchup.”\n\nA genuine case can be made for Jimmy Graham to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nGraham’s prime with the New Orleans Saints is comparable to any tight end in NFL history, including Travis Kelce.\n\nIn the 2011 season, Graham had 99 receptions for 1,310 yards and 11 touchdowns and made his first of five Pro Bowl appearances.\n\nTwo years later, he led the league with 16 touchdown receptions, four more than Kelce has ever had in a single season.\n\nGraham’s main problem is that he did not have the longevity you would expect from a Hall of Famer.\n\nGraham’s prime only lasted six years (2011-2017), whereas most Hall of Famers sustained decade-long excellence.\n\nSeahawks HC Mike Macdonald claps back at Druski over Jaxon Smith-Njigba joke\n\nMyles Garrett went to Italy to support girlfriend Chloe Kim at Winter Olympics after winning DPOY\n\nSeattle Seahawks Super Bowl LX parade draws almost 1 million people in celebration",

    "fullText": "The ink isn’t even dry, and the hangovers are barely over for the Seattle Seahawks. They won the Super Bowl. They should be able to enjoy it, right? We know how the NFL works, though. This is and 365 day a 365-day-a-year enterprise, and the grind never stops.\n\nAs the Seahawks look towards the 2026 season, and let’s be honest, that’s already happening, one of the biggest questions is the future of Cooper Kupp.\n\nMORE: NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break\n\nFrom a regular-season perspective, Kupp’s first season in Seattle wasn’t great. He finished with just 47 catches for 593 yards and two touchdowns. Kupp wasn’t close to being the same dominating player that he was in his prime with the Los Angeles Rams. While part of that was due to the sheer dominance and overwhelming success of Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the Seattle running game, it was hard not to take note of that.\n\nWith Smith-Njigba dealing with a concussion in the Super Bowl, Kupp stepped up and caught six of 12 targets for 61 yards. It closed out a strong postseason in which he caught 15 passes for 157 yards and a touchdown in three games.\n\nBut with the veteran entering his age-33 season, Seattle has a tough decision to make on Kupp.\n\nHe has a $17.47 million cap hit next season and that comes with $8 million of dead money. While the Seahawks are currently fifth in available cap space at $73 million, releasing Kupp would create a substantial windfall. Seattle is fortunate that Sam Darnold is on an affordable contract for a quarterback, but Kenneth Walker is a free agent, and they can’t ignore the status of their defense.\n\nRashid Shaheed is also a free agent, which means that the Seahawks are thin at the receiver position. But is Kupp the best use of their capital and roster space? He showed this season that he’s not capable of being a true number two receiver, and he’s overpaid to be a third or fourth option. If Kupp is still in Seattle in 2026, it will likely be because his contract was re-done.\n\nOLYMPICS: Norway skier goes viral after displaying insane Winter Olympics speed\n\nSUPER BOWL: Ranking the last 10 NFL Super Bowl champions\n\nMLB: Texas Rangers’ Nolan Ryan jersey giveaway is a bloody mess\n\nMEDIA: Photos of potential suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance released by FBI\n\nVIRAL: Norwegian Olympics star makes stunning girlfriend admission after winning bronze medal\n\nThe post Seahawks have a tough decision to make on star player after Super Bowl win appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "If you build it, they will come?\n\nSome Iowa state senators introduced a bill this week that would expand the state's major economic growth attraction program, creating financial incentives that could lure an NFL team seeking to build a stadium in the Hawkeye State.\n\nTheir target? The Chicago Bears.\n\n\"After years of Bears fans seeking refuge across the Mississippi River from the incompetence, corruption and punitive tax and regulatory climate in the state of Illinois, it is time for the team to join their fans on the west side of the river,\" Republican Scott Webster, one of the legislation's sponsors said in a statement.\n\n\"Iowa can offer the Bears everything they need to build a world-class facility, tax certainty and the public infrastructure they need in a state led by common-sense conservatives.\"\n\nThe recruitment pitch didn't end there.\n\n\"While Illinois and Indiana squabble over this issue, we are ready to get off the sidelines and into the game,\" Kerry Gruenhagen, another senator sponsoring the bill, said in a statement. \"Bringing an NFL team to Iowa would attract jobs, tourism and fans to our state and give us the opportunity to showcase what Iowa really has to offer. Iowans have dedicated themselves to our college sports teams, and we're ready to attract a professional team to our great state.\"\n\nWhile Iowa was the stage for \"Field of Dreams,\" it isn't home to any major professional sports franchises.\n\nOne of the NFL's original franchises, born in 1920 as the Decatur Staleys, the Bears have been seeking a new stadium for years. Tenants of historic Soldier Field, the league's smallest venue in terms of capacity (61,500) in downtown Chicago since 1971, the Bears had planned to move to suburban Arlington Heights, where they own a 326-acre tract of land that used to be the site of Arlington International Racecourse.\n\nBut team president Kevin Warren wrote in a letter to season ticket-holders in December that an inability to get assistance from the state of Illinois in offsetting infrastructure costs around the proposed project had led the team to consider alternatives. The team has committed to paying for construction of a new stadium itself.\n\n\"We have not asked for state taxpayer dollars to build the stadium at Arlington Park. We asked only for a commitment to essential local infrastructure (roads, utilities, and site improvements) which is more than typical for projects of this size,\" Warren wrote. \"Additionally, we sought reasonable property tax certainty to secure financing. We listened to state leadership and relied on their direction and guidance, yet our efforts have been met with no legislative partnership.\n\n\"We have been told directly by State leadership, our project will not be a priority in 2026.\"\n\nWarren specifically cited Northwest Indiana as a potential locale to build a new stadium.\n\nHowever, Illinois officials continue working to find a solution that would keep the Bears, a beloved team and one on the rise after winning the NFC North for the first time since 2018, in the Chicagoland area, where they've played since 1921.\n\n\"There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,\" Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday.\n\n\"But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the Legislature.\"\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Chicago Bears to Iowa?

    "description": "These prospects should've made the cut.",
    "fullText": "Top snubs from the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs we close the book on the 2025 season, the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine will give us our first taste of football for the offseason. The football world will descend upon Indianapolis for a week of interviews, drills, and athletic testing destined to shape the late-winter discourse.\n\nOver 300 prospects will be invited to the event, hoping to boost their draft stocks ahead of the pro day circuit. Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss won't be among them.\n\nFear not, Chambliss was not left off the list for character concerns or bureaucratic oversight. Rather, it's an indictment of the NFL's expectations for his pending hearing, which is challenging the NCAA's decision to deny his waiver for eligibility. It seems like Chambliss is headed back to school, allowing us to focus on the prospects who were snubbed from the Scouting Combine.\n\nBlack, after six college seasons, will play the majority of his rookie season at 25 years old. That developmental path (and his age-adjusted production) isn't kind to his draft stock, and it may be the biggest reason he isn't headed to Indianapolis.\n\nHowever, Black put himself on NFL radars in 2025, playing a significant role on a championship-winning offense. Black ran for 1,040 yards and 10 scores this past season. He boasts NFL-level athleticism with the speed to hit home runs, experience with zone and gap runs, and enough size to check the box.\n\nIn a world where Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Georgia Tech's Haynes King are getting Combine invites, it becomes difficult to gather why Kaliakmanis won't be among the participants in Indianapolis.\n\nKaliakmanis was incredibly productive for Rutgers, ranking eighth in EPA and seventh in EPA/DB -- between Pavia and King -- in 2025. He's not a lock to get drafted, but Kaliakmanis looks the part of a mid-Day 3 pick and a prototypical backup quarterback at the next level. With a big arm and multiple seasons of starting experience, it's surprising that he hasn't gotten more love.\n\nTyren Montgomery, WR, John Carroll\n\nPerhaps the most notable admission from the Combine festivities is John Carroll's Tyren Montgomery. His wild ride to Mobile culminated in a strong Senior Bowl performance, proving that a Division III standout could play with the best upperclassmen the Division I could offer.\n\nAn excellent athlete at 6'1\", 190 pounds, Carroll seems like a prospect the NFL would want to see get as many reps as possible during the pre-draft process. Given that nearly 50 receivers were invited to the event, Montgomery should have received an invitation.\n\nFoster stood out on my preseason board as a potential low-end starter headlining the Kansas offensive line. All he's done in the time since is continue to win in pass protection.\n\nFoster has SEC pedigree after three seasons in the middle of Texas A&M's line, then he took a step forward against Big 12 competition. With adequate measurables and a track record of success, his median projection still looks like a solid backup center.\n\nTerion Stewart, RB, Virginia Tech\n\nStewart won't be in Indianapolis because of his production. Just 469 yards in his first year of Power 4 play isn't all that impressive, and nine career receptions is laughably little work through the air.\n\nMORE: Meet the three contenders for RB2 in the 2026 NFL Draft\n\nHowever, Stewart has intriguing fundamentals, fun burst, and elite contact balance, perhaps making him a role player at the next level. It will be an uphill climb to raise his stock during the pre-draft process, but his film made a worthy case for Indianapolis. I expect him to be a priority free agent in April, much like Raheim Sanders.\n\nHaynes shares a lot of similarities with Wake Forest's Demond Claiborne, who rightfully rose up boards in a bad running back class. The Georgia Tech back is undersized and limited to a rotational role at the next level. Still, Haynes has the athleticism, footwork, and instincts to make plays on Sundays.\n\nHaynes is a former receiver who stands out as a natural pass-catcher out of the backfield. As an integral piece of Georgia Tech's run-heavy attack, an inefficient season shouldn't have cost him the chance to show out at the Scouting Combine.\n\nFive prospects who make sense for Klint Kubiak's Las Vegas Raiders\n\nFive winners from the 2026 Senior Bowl\n\nSeattle Seahawks Super Bowl mock draft\n\nPatriots mock draft: How New England can get Drake Maye the help he needs",

    "fullText": "Maxx Crosby’s future remains up in the air as we speak. The star defensive end didn’t end the 2025 NFL season on the best of terms with the Las Vegas Raiders. The AFC West team shut him down for the final two weeks of the regular season, which caused issues in their relationships.\n\nAs the days go by, it seems that Crosby is closer to the exit door. He has been mentioned as a potential trade target for Super Bowl contenders, including the defending champions Seattle Seahawks, as well as other strong teams such as the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s edition of ESPN’s “Get Up,” former NFL player Jason McCourty floated the idea of the Raiders shipping Crosby to Texas and landing one of the best wide receivers in the league.\n\n“If I’m the Raiders, why not go out and trade Maxx Crosby to the Dallas Cowboys?” He questioned. “You franchise tag George Pickens, you don’t work on a long-term deal. You trade him to the Raiders, get Crosby in exchange.\n\n“Now you just beefed up your defensive line. New coordinator coming over. Maxx Crosby is going to make everybody on the defensive side of the ball better, and of top of that, have you watched the way Maxx Crosby plays the game of football? He plays every single play of the game.”\n\nMaxx Crosby for George Pickens?\n\n@JasonMcCourty lays out a potential Cowboys-Raiders deal pic.twitter.com/Ng0umUEQLj\n\n— Get Up (@GetUpESPN) February 11, 2026\n\nMcCourty added that landing George Pickens would put Fernando Mendoza in a position to succeed with the Raiders. The future No. 1 overall pick won’t have much to work with if he joined the Raiders today, and Pickens is coming off his best season to date.\n\nAccording to Jason LaCanfora of Sports Boom, Maxx Crosby made a final decision on his future with the Raiders. The defensive end reportedly informed minority owner Tom Brady that he won’t suit up for the team again.\n\n“He told (Raiders owner and future Hall of Fame quarterback) Tom Brady he will never play for the Raiders again,” LaCanfora wrote.\n\nHe noted that the same happened with Myles Garrett last season, and he agreed to return to the Cleveland Browns.

    "description": "A recent report confirms what has been reported for weeks. The Bears will not receive comp picks for Ian Cunningham leaving to be Atlanta’s GM.",
    "fullText": "According to Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, who emailed the NFL for confirmation, the Chicago Bears will not receive compensatory draft picks for losing assistant general manager Ian Cunningham to the Atlanta Falcons, where he will serve as their general manager.\n\n“The policy for receiving picks pertains to the head coach or the primary football executive,” the NFL told PFT on Tuesday via email. “The primary football executive position was filled by Matt Ryan.”\n\nThis was the expectation all along, since Matt Ryan was hired to be the Falcons’ president of football, a position Cunningham also interviewed for. Had Cunningham been hired for that job, which is Atlanta’s primary football executive, then the Bears would have been awarded two third-round draft picks by virtue of the Rooney Rule.\n\nWhat brought this subject up again was Ryan’s recent declaration that Cunningham will take the lead on roster decisions.\n\nAfter being asked if he would be actively involved in the draft and free agency, Ryan said, “Ian is in charge of that space.” Ryan went on to say that he’s looking forward to learning about the draft process because he’s never even sat in a draft meeting, and that he “has a lot to learn.“\n\nHe reiterated that Cunningham is “driving this boat, and he’s the one that’s leading us moving forward,” but Ryan will be involved and helping out in any way he can. “This is Ian’s regular season right now; he is in it, and he is driving the ship for us.”\n\nEvery team has a primary and a secondary football executive position on file with the league, and no matter what that’s called from team to team, or what the responsibilities for each of those are, there’s no getting around the 1-2 front office hierarchy that each franchise has set up.",

    "fullText": "While Indiana officials play up their efforts to lure the Chicago Bears across the border for a new stadium, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday that he and his staff have made “progress” to incentivize the football team to stay in Illinois.\n\nThe governor’s comments come as Pritzker’s January calendar shows he had two scheduled conversations with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell while Goodell was in Chicago for the Bears-Packers playoff game on Jan. 10.\n\nDuring his time here for the game, Goodell joined Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren and Chair George McCaskey on a tour of the Arlington Heights site the team owns, and sites in northwest Indiana, including one near Wolf Lake in Hammond.\n\nThe first conversation between the governor and Goodell was a scheduled half-hour phone call on Jan. 9, while the second was a half-hour discussion between the two on Jan. 12, according to the governor’s calendar entries. The governor’s office on Monday declined to comment on how the conversations went or what was said.\n\nBut the scheduled talks underscore that efforts surrounding the Bears stadium have not gone dormant, even though the team said in December it was exploring a move to northwest Indiana after negotiations with Pritzker and his Democratic allies in the Illinois General Assembly hit a lull.\n\nThe key sticking points in Illinois have been over how the state would legislatively or financially aid the team in its desire to build a stadium in Chicago’s northwest suburbs. In particular, topics have evolved around assistance for infrastructure around a proposed Arlington Heights stadium, property tax certainty for the team and payment of debt for the Soldier Field renovations done more than 20 years ago at the team’s behest.\n\nSources familiar with the discussions between the Bears and state of Illinois officials said both sides have been meeting regularly since early December to hammer out legislation for this spring’s legislative session in Springfield. The talks have been in line with public infrastructure improvements for or around the Bears stadium site in Arlington Heights and so-called megaprojects legislation that would make it easier for the Bears to negotiate with local governments over property taxes, sources said. In addition, the governor’s office has sought for the Bears to implement measures to make games more affordable, the sources said.\n\nSince the Bears’ December announcement that opened the door to a stadium across the border, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun has said his administration was “working hard” to attract the Bears and has pushed a bill to establish a state authority to “acquire, construct, equip, own, lease, and finance” a sports stadium.\n\nBut on Monday, Pritzker, during an unrelated news conference in southwest Illinois, cast an optimistic tone when he described Illinois officials’ relationship with the Bears these days.\n\n“There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,” he said in Belleville, where he and other lawmakers talked about a bond program meant to spur economic development in Illinois communities. “But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the legislature.”\n\nThe Tribune reported that in late December, Pritzker’s office signed a new $25,000 contract with an outside attorney to continue advising the administration in negotiations with the Bears through the end of June.\n\nPritzker on Monday also reiterated his position on the Bears’ quest for state incentives that he does not want taxpayer money paying for the stadium itself but would be willing to use state money to help the team with infrastructure funding, which generally includes improvements to roads and other transportation-related initiatives.\n\n“We are helping businesses build infrastructure, for example, which they would need, and other things that are sort of available, again, to any business that is growing or building something new in the state of Illinois that’s putting people to work,” the governor said. “You know, those are normal incentives, and that’s what I would expect that we will end up with the Bears, you know, depending on where it goes.”\n\nA team consultant estimated last year that infrastructure improvements from near Illinois Route 53 and changes to a nearby Metra train line could cost more than $850 million in public funds. What’s more, the Bears would likely need megaproject legislation that would allow them to negotiate with local governments over property tax bills.\n\nAnother issue for Bears officials is more than $500 million in outstanding public debt from the controversial 2003 Soldier Field renovation, a tab currently covered by city hotel taxes and, when that falls short, by Chicago’s share of state income taxes. The Bears’ lease at Soldier Field expires in 2033, but it can be broken early with a penalty, and the team says it will take three years to build its new stadium.\n\nBut even with the debt paid off, that alone might not be enough to satisfy state lawmakers who represent swaths of Chicago and are reluctant to incentivize the team to move out of the city limits, even if it’s to Arlington Heights.\n\nIn Springfield a few weeks ago, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, a Democrat from Hillside, sent out a survey to other House Democrats about where they stand on the Bears issue. The results of that survey were not available.\n\nAs for whether he’s taking the Bears’ interest in relocating to Indiana seriously, Pritzker said Monday, “I never take anything as if it’s a bluff.”\n\n“I mean, I’m always concerned about making sure that we’re attracting businesses or keeping businesses in the state of Illinois,” he said. “So we’re in consistent conversation with the Chicago Bears — have been, by the way, for, I don’t know, a year and a half or two years. And specifically, I think there’s a real possibility that many of the things that we put on the table to work with the Bears on are things that they’re willing to do to stay in the state of Illinois.”",

    "fullText": "Chloe Rodriguez is praising her longtime boyfriend, Cam Skattebo\n\nWhile speaking with PEOPLE at the EA Sports Madden Bowl, Rodriguez shared how she's navigating her boyfriend's viral fame\n\nRodriguez and Skattebo have been dating since college\n\nChloe Rodriguez is sharing her secrets to having a successful relationship with a partner in the NFL.\n\nThe influencer, 23, has been dating her boyfriend, New York Giants running back Cam Skattebo, since at least 2022, when the two were both attending California State University, Sacramento.\n\nWhile chatting with PEOPLE at the EA Sports Madden Bowl on Feb. 6, over Super Bowl weekend in San Francisco, Calif., Rodriguez and Skattebo opened up about how they've navigated the pressures of Skattebo's NFL career.\n\nSkattebo notes that the key to maintaining their relationship in the spotlight has been \"not taking things too serious,\" with Rodriguez echoing that it was important to be \"patient\" with one another.\n\n\"Just living life,\" Skattebo continues.\n\nSkattebo and Rodriguez also shared their reactions to Skattebo's multiple viral moments over the course of last year's NFL season. Skattebo made headlines after he did a backflip in the end zone during a Sept. 28 game against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\"I mean, I had to get used to it, but it was different, but I've known that he's been like this, so he's been a superstar since I met him,\" Rodriguez says, of watching Skattebo build up a viral presence on and off the field.\n\n\"It's been awesome,\" Skattebo shares. \"With everything that's been coming my way, I've been taking it in and being able to navigate it in the right way and it's been great.\"\n\nSkattebo has become known for nonstop backflips, an aggressive playing style and running into telephone poles.\n\nSkattebo's mother, Becky Skattebo, previously gave a glimpse into the untraditional tactics her 23-year-old son would practice in his younger years in hopes of going pro during an ESPN interview.\n\n\"He would put his brother's shoulder pads on and he would run into telephone poles,\" Becky told the outlet. \"Once he got onto the field, it was no surprise the punishment he inflicted on his own body and everybody else.\"\n\nSkattebo and Rodriguez first met in college, when Rodriguez was a part of the Hornets cheerleading squad.\n\nSince then, she's been a staunch supporter of Skattebo. When he was selected by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, she commemorated the occasion with a post on Instagram showing the two celebrating.\n\n“I love supporting you, keep making us proud,\" she wrote. \"❤️ time to head back east, go @nygiants!”\n\nShe was there to see the Giants play the Los Angeles Chargers in September 2025, and she sometimes wears her boyfriend’s custom SKATT chain when watching him play.\n\nWhen Skattebo moved east to play for the Giants, Rodriguez joined him. In the summer of 2025, Rodriguez posted a photo of the N.Y.C. skyline on her Instagram Stories, tagging Skattebo and Hoboken, N.J., alongside a house emoji.",

    "fullText": "Had the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl on Sunday, their 2026 home showdown with the Denver Broncos would have been a perfect choice for the NFL's season opener.\n\nSuch a scenario is off the board after the Seattle Seahawks easily took care of business with a 29-13 win over New England in Super Bowl LX. That means Seattle is now set to host the NFL's 2026 season opener.\n\nThe Seahawks are among the Broncos' 2026 opponents, but that game is scheduled to be played in Denver. So the league will have Seattle open the season at Lumen Field against one of their home opponents.\n\nThe defending Super Bowl champion opening the season on the road is not unprecedented, but it is uncommon. Following the 2012 season, the Broncos hosted the Baltimore Ravens in Week 1 of the 2013 season, but that was due to unique circumstances.\n\nThe Ravens had a scheduling conflict with the MLB's Baltimore Orioles, so they were not able to play at home in Week 1, and the league instead scheduled a rematch with the team they knocked out of the 2012 playoffs. Denver won 49-27. The Seahawks don't have a scheduling conflict, so they will open the season at home.\n\nSeattle will also host the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers in 2026, but those teams are set to face off in Australia, likely in Week 1, this season.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Seahawks play Broncos in 2026, but not in season opener",

    "fullText": "Every NFL franchise dreams of reaching the Super Bowl, but for some teams the road to football’s biggest stage has been paved with more heartbreak than triumph. The list of most Super Bowl losses highlights organizations that have repeatedly come close to the ultimate prize only to fall short on the grandest stage. While losses can be tough for fans to swallow, they also reflect sustained excellence — getting to the championship game is itself a rare and remarkable achievement that only a handful of teams enjoy. From perennial contenders to decades-long underdogs, these franchises have forged identities around both drama and resilience.\n\nThe Patriots’ six Super Bowl losses are almost paradoxical when paired with their dynasty status. They reached the Super Bowl so often that disappointment became the price of sustained dominance. Several of those losses were razor-thin, last-minute heartbreaks that still sting New England fans. Ultimately, the volume of losses reflects just how frequently the Patriots lived on the NFL’s biggest stage.\n\nDenver’s Super Bowl losses include some of the most lopsided defeats in big-game history, which made them especially painful. For years, those blowouts defined the franchise more than its wins. Still, the Broncos kept returning, refusing to fade from relevance. Their later championships softened the scars, but those early losses remain unforgettable chapters.\n\nThe Bills’ four Super Bowl losses are unique — all came consecutively, an unmatched run of dominance and disappointment. That early-1990s team was powerful enough to rule the AFC but just couldn’t finish the job. Despite the heartbreak, Buffalo’s fanbase takes pride in that era’s consistency and grit. Those losses became part of the franchise’s identity rather than its undoing.\n\nMinnesota’s four Super Bowl defeats came during an era when the Vikings were perennial contenders. The “Purple People Eaters” defense struck fear across the league, yet the Lombardi Trophy always slipped away. That legacy of being close—but not close enough—has followed the franchise for decades. For Vikings fans, Super Bowl loss is both history and heartbreak.\n\nThe 49ers are better known for perfection in Super Bowls than failure, which makes their three losses stand out. Each defeat came during transitional moments between dominant eras. Rather than defining the franchise, those losses highlighted how high the standard was in San Francisco. Even in defeat, the 49ers were almost always contenders.\n\nAll three of Cincinnati’s Super Bowl losses came against the same opponent, giving the defeats an almost cruel symmetry. The Bengals were competitive in each appearance, often falling just short late. Those losses reinforced the narrative of a franchise knocking on the door but unable to break through. Recent success has reignited belief that history doesn’t have to repeat itself.\n\nPhiladelphia’s Super Bowl losses were emotional, hard-fought games that mirrored the city’s blue-collar identity. Each defeat deepened the hunger of one of the NFL’s most passionate fanbases. Those losses made eventual victory feel earned rather than inevitable. They’re reminders of how long the climb was before reaching the summit.\n\nThe Rams’ Super Bowl losses span multiple cities and eras, reflecting a franchise constantly reinventing itself. Some defeats were defensive struggles, others offensive collapses, but all were defining moments. Each loss forced organizational change and evolution. That adaptability eventually helped lead them back to championship success.\n\nMiami’s Super Bowl losses are often overshadowed by their perfect season and early dominance. Still, those defeats show how even elite teams aren’t immune to regression and disappointment. The Dolphins experienced both sides of football immortality within a short span. Their losses serve as a reminder that dynasties are fragile.\n\nDallas’ three Super Bowl losses sit quietly behind a louder legacy of championships. Each defeat came during eras of immense expectation and national spotlight. The losses didn’t diminish the brand, but they did humanize it. For “America’s Team,” even defeat became part of the mythology.\n\nThe Chiefs’ Super Bowl losses represent the bridge between old heartbreak and modern dominance. Before their recent success, Kansas City spent decades chasing relevance on the biggest stage. Those losses made the later championships feel transformational rather than routine. They’re proof that patience can eventually pay off in spectacular fashion.\n\nLooking across the history of the Super Bowl, patterns of near-misses and redemption emerge just as vividly as the glory of victory. The teams with the most losses have all carved out unique narratives — some marked by eras of dominance that ended in narrow defeat, others by periods of heartbreak that galvanized their fanbases. Yet for every loss on this list, there are lessons learned, legacies built, and the promise of future triumphs still to come. In the end, what matters as much as the losses are the stories of perseverance and passion that define these franchises and their supporters.\n\nThe post Teams with most losses in the Super Bowl appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "With Aden Durde having become the first overseas coach to win the Super Bowl, what does it mean for the NFL and the international game?",
    "fullText": "While most of the Seattle Seahawks' staff charged on to the field at the end of Super Bowl 60, Aden Durde took a moment for himself.\n\nHe was congratulated by one colleague but then threw his headset on to a sideline bench at Levi's Stadium, sat down and gazed skywards.\n\nAs fireworks and confetti filled the Santa Clara air, a smile spread across the Briton's face as it dawned on Durde what he had achieved.\n\nThe 46-year-old from north London had just become the first overseas coach to win American football's biggest prize.\n\nIt was a dream fulfilled, one that began with watching a video of the Chicago Bears team that won the Super Bowl in 1986.\n\nSome 40 years on, now he too is a Super Bowl champion and is inspiring others outside the US to follow their NFL dreams.\n\n\"It feels amazing,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I'm still trying to process it.\n\n\"To come from London and be here, I don't take any of that for granted. I'm so proud.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nDuring five years as defensive co-ordinator of the London Warriors, Durde was able to earn coaching internships with the Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons, before the latter made him Britain's first full-time NFL coach in 2018.\n\nHe progressed through roles with Atlanta and Dallas before Seattle's new head coach Mike Macdonald made Durde his defensive co-ordinator in 2024.\n\n'AD', as he is known at the Seahawks, has since helped create a defence he describes as \"fast, physical, ball-hungry, and they work as a collective\".\n\n\"AD is an absolute game-changer for us,\" said Macdonald on Monday. \"It's not just an incredible story that got him to this point, it's him as a football mind, a football coach.\n\n\"He's someone that has really brought us together, and the way that our defence plays inspired football is a great tribute to how AD operates, and what he brings to our football team and our organisation. I'm really happy for AD.\n\n\"He's just an absolute beast and he's so much fun to work with. He's right there alongside, building this whole thing. It's been a special journey.\"\n\nThe Seahawks dominated the New England Patriots to win 29-13 on Sunday, but Durde has not just become a Super Bowl champion, he has helped forge a defence that will go down in NFL folklore.\n\nSeattle's defence has been dubbed 'the Dark Side' and produced a performance long-time NFL analyst Cris Collinsworth said was \"as good as I have ever seen\".\n\n\"That's pretty cool,\" said Durde. \"But we have to give credit to the players. They made a commitment, they wanted to be the best in the world, and we got the outcome we wanted.\"\n\nWas this the ultimate Super Bowl redemption story?\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nAs he finished speaking to reporters after Sunday's game, with a British flag around his waist, Durde admitted he felt emotional.\n\n\"I'm trying to hold it back, I just want to get out of here,\" he joked.\n\nNFL analyst Phoebe Schecter used to coach with Durde on the NFL's International Player Pathway programme and shared a moment with him on the field.\n\n\"As someone that's known him for quite some time, [I know] he doesn't like to be emotional, but he couldn't help himself,\" she said.\n\n\"The moment is so big, the achievement is so big, and he knows that he's made history.\"\n\nDurde has spoken about being the best he can be, to make it easier for others to follow his lead, and Schecter is excited about what Durde's story means for the international game.\n\n\"Aden's great because he's not just thinking about himself in the moment,\" Schecter said.\n\n\"For years he's been thinking about other people, building the NFL Academy and the International Player Pathway programme. He's constantly sending that elevator back down.\n\n\"I think he knows how much it means, not just to the UK but to the rest of the international space, [for people] to think 'I could be that person one day, I could coach in the NFL'.\"\n\nWhile working with NFL UK, Durde shared an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora and they founded the IPP programme.\n\n\"I remember Osi telling me about [Durde] back in the day and then followed his journey,\" said NFL executive Peter O'Reilly.\n\n\"How talented he is and how well respected he is by his players, and what a great person he is, that just makes him someone you want to root for.\"\n\nThe IPP helped Britain's Efe Obada and Australia's Jordan Mailata get into the NFL, and former rugby league player Mailata won a Super Bowl last year with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"Whether it's coaching or playing, having those role models, those local heroes, where someone in the UK can look up and say 'OK, there's a path for me', is really important - like last year for a young Australian looking at Jordan Mailata,\" O'Reilly added.\n\n\"The IPP is also a great breeding ground for international coaches. You want that mix of coaches, and we've been in engaged in how we build that pipeline, making sure programmes for coaching development are not just US-based but global.\"\n\nAnd Durde has challenged others to take a shot, saying: \"You just have to set goals and understand there's always people out there that do believe in you. You've just got to push forward and go for what you believe in. That's what life's about.\"\n\nWhat's next for NFL as latest international games confirmed?\n\nOnce Durde joined Seattle's on-field celebrations at Levi's Stadium, he was joined by his wife Kate and their two sons.\n\nTheir eldest son, Kane Doyle-Durde, now works as a scout for the Dallas Cowboys and their youngest Dylan is working in coaching.\n\n\"We just hugged, we were grateful for the moment,\" said Durde.\n\n\"A lot of people have sacrificed a lot for me to be sitting here, but you don't see all the people around me that helped me get here. I'm very grateful for them.\"\n\nThey include many back in the UK, who Durde aims to catch up with now the NFL season is over.\n\n\"I've got to get back to London, get this mayhem out of the way,\" he laughed. \"I need to go home.\"\n\nIn particular, Durde is looking forward to seeing his close friend Marvin Allen, one of a few Britons to own a Super Bowl ring having been on the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice squad when they became NFL champions in 2009.\n\nDurde had two interviews for head-coach positions during the current hiring cycle and - although he is set to remain with Seattle next season - Allen is confident he will become the NFL's first overseas head coach.\n\n\"Aden has come from obscurity to take an American sport by storm,\" he said.\n\n\"One day NFL owners will say 'this guy that's comes from nowhere to win a Super Bowl, let's give that guy a go'.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

The NFL Kickoff game was quite the dramatic start to the year as an early ejection as Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected from the game for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.\n\nWhile the matchup was a defensive battle, the reigning champions took a 24-20 victory over Dallas to begin the 2025 season.\n\nThe Chargers competed in the international opener against the Kansas City Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil. The Bolts earned a 27-21 win over their AFC West rivals to kick off the season.\n\nThe Week 1 thriller featured the best of Justin Herbert as he threw for 318 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nIt was a statement win for the Bolts and the team will look to continue making waves in 2026, potentially starting the year against the Seahawks at Lumen Field.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: Chargers are candidate to play in the 2026 NFL season opener",

    "fullText": "Winning a Super Bowl is the highest mark of success for an NFL head coach. Only a small group of active coaches can say they have done it. Some built long careers around steady success. Others reached the top early in their coaching journey. Each of these coaches shaped their teams in a different way. Their titles show strong leadership, smart planning, and the ability to win on the biggest stage. Here is a look at the active Super Bowl-winning head coaches.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LX)\n\nMike Macdonald is the newest coach to join this list. He led the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl LX win in 2026. Seattle defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to earn its second title in franchise history.\n\nHis defensive game plan was the key to the victory. Seattle’s defense controlled the Patriots’ offense from start to finish. Pressure came from all angles and forced mistakes.\n\nThat championship made Macdonald one of the youngest head coaches to win a Super Bowl. The win also proved his defensive style can work at the highest level. Seattle now looks to build around that success for future seasons.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLVII with Baltimore Ravens)\n\nJohn Harbaugh won his Super Bowl with the Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII. That victory helped define his long career in Baltimore. He became known as a coach who could win with strong defense and smart special teams play.\n\nHis teams stayed competitive through many roster changes. New players came in and old stars moved on. Success continued because Harbaugh adjusted his approach to fit his personnel.\n\nHowever, following a disappointing 2025 regular season, Harbaugh was fired from Balti\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLIV)\n\nSean Payton earned his Super Bowl title with the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV. His offense stood out for its creativity and balance. Play calling became a major part of his reputation.\n\nLater, he moved to the Denver Broncos to begin a new chapter. Experience gives him an edge in building a culture of discipline and preparation.\n\nOffensive ideas from Payton influenced many coaches around the league. His teams often play with speed and confidence. Denver now relies on that knowledge to return to championship form.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LVI)\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a title in Super Bowl LVI. He became known for modern offensive design and clear communication with his players.\n\nYouth never slowed him down. Playoff runs became common under his leadership. Los Angeles stayed competitive in a tough division because of his planning and play structure.\n\nEach season shows his ability to adapt. Changes at quarterback and defense never stopped his teams from finding ways to win. Many see him as one of the smartest minds in football today.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LIX)\n\nNick Sirianni reached the top with the Eagles during a time when offense ruled the league. His coaching focused on balance and teamwork.\n\nRoster development became one of his strengths. Young players improved quickly under his system. Veterans also fit well into his plans.\n\nPhiladelphia built a strong identity with him in charge. Toughness and energy defined the team’s style. A Bowl win confirmed his place among the league’s top young coaches.\n\nAndy Reid leads this list with three Super Bowl titles. His record shows long-term excellence and steady results. Kansas City became a powerhouse under his leadership.\n\nOffensive creativity sets him apart. Play designs keep defenses guessing every season. Quarterbacks thrive in his system because it allows freedom and structure at the same time.\n\nYears of playoff success place him among the best in NFL history. Consistency defines his career more than any single season. Few active coaches match his résumé.\n\nActive Super Bowl-winning head coaches represent the highest level of achievement in the NFL. Each one reached the top through different paths. Some relied on defense. Others built great offenses. Experience and adaptability connect them all. Their championships show what strong leadership can do for a team. As seasons continue, these coaches will try to add more titles and strengthen their legacy.\n\nThe post Active Super Bowl winning head coaches in the NFL appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold leading the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl glory could just be the greatest redemption story ever in the NFL. We take a closer look.",
    "fullText": "The Sam Darnold redemption story is quite something - from being rated as one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL to Super Bowl champion.\n\nIt's a tale of never giving up, of character, unwavering self-belief and persistence, but also a warning for teams not to write a quarterback off too soon.\n\nAs youngsters being drafted into the NFL are at the mercy of circumstance, not every team will fit every rookie and the sport's history is littered with college stars deemed not good enough.\n\nThey often bounce around from team to team, as Darnold did, but never has one plumbed the depths before managing to rise up and claim the sport's ultimate prize in the ultimate NFL redemption story.\n\nSeahawks beat Patriots to win Super Bowl 60 with crushing defensive display - as it happened\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to win Super Bowl\n\nSo how bad was Darnold? Well, the numbers were not great, as after being drafted in 2018 he spent three seasons with the New York Jets and two with the Carolina Panthers - during which time he ranked bottom or near the bottom in several areas.\n\nWins were the main one - just 21 of them in five seasons - but categories like passer rating and completion percentage were the worst of any quarterback during that time.\n\nAs a third pick in the draft he was ridiculed for his \"seeing ghosts\" comment as he struggled, and labelled a bust, but now he's getting fitted for a Super Bowl ring it's clear he was only part of the problem.\n\nFellow Jets quarterbacks Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith and Zach Wilson also all finished dead last in passer rating in their first three seasons with the team. Notice a theme?\n\nThat's a quirk of the NFL Draft system, the best players go to the worst teams, and while some could just be having an off season so can build for success, some have serious issues.\n\nAfter Sunday, Darnold has now won 39 games since leaving New York, including serving two years as a back-up - the Jets have won just 26.\n\nThe Panthers have won 15 to Darnold's 31 since leaving Carolina and even the Vikings and 49ers can't match his wins since he departed.\n\nPeople forget that at just 21 he was the youngest NFL starting quarterback since the 1970 merger - perhaps the young man was just in the wrong place after all.\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\n\"Quarterbacks need tonnes of help to allow you to go show how great you can be. If you do not get that help, you are limited in how great you can be,\" said former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and three-time Super Bowl champion Steve Young.\n\n\"And there are not 32 places in the league today that can give you that help.\"\n\nYoung knows when a team is not a good fit, as he was drafted by a poor Tampa Bay squad and won three games in two seasons before leaving to join the 49ers and eventually becoming a Hall of Fame member.\n\nIronically enough it was a largely forgotten season in San Francisco that also provided the catalyst for Darnold to launch the comeback of all comebacks.\n\n\"I didn't play great football the first few years of my career,\" Darnold admitted after the Super Bowl. \"Then I come here to San Francisco and I think because of that year I was able to learn a tonne. I was able to kind of learn and go to Minnesota and play good football there. I was able to come to Seattle and do the same.\"\n\nWorking in a fully functioning franchise, learning from coach Kyle Shanahan and serving as back-up to Brock Purdy in a Super Bowl saw Darnold head to Minnesota better equipped to succeed.\n\nThe irony of returning to Levi's Stadium for his crowning glory was not lost on him.\n\nA stellar season in Minnesota came after he replaced injured rookie JJ McCarthy, but then more irony in the Vikings opting to stick with the quarterback they drafted saw Darnold move on again.\n\nHe left after massive career highs of 14 wins, over 4,000 yards and 35 touchdowns, but still with question marks after a play-off capitulation against the Rams.\n\nOnce again, he had a point to prove.\n\nQuarterbacks grab all the headlines, for good or bad, but they simply cannot do it all by themselves in this ultimate team sport.\n\nTom Brady regularly had, and needed, a top-10 defence on his side to win Super Bowls, while Patrick Mahomes lost two of them because he was soundly beaten up by opposing defences.\n\nIn Seattle, Darnold found the perfect storm of a team on the up and a defensive head coach assembling a crack unit that would go on to dominate the NFL, needing just a solid quarterback to steer the offence.\n\nHaving the league's leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Super Bowl MVP running back Kenneth Walker also helped, and plenty will say Darnold did not have to do much.\n\nHe became the first quarterback to enjoy successive 14-win seasons with two different teams - only Brady had managed it with one - but still there were questions as he led the league in turnovers, giving the ball away 20 times.\n\nAround 80% of play-off games are won by teams with the fewest turnovers. In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nDarnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.\n\nThe response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.\n\nHe answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.\n\nWas it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.\n\nNo quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.\n\nLuck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.\n\nNone have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it. His redemption story really is one for the ages.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures",

    "fullText": "The NFL inevitably will expand the regular season to 18 games. It's a matter of \"when\" not \"if.\"\n\nAs to the when, it could still happen the season after next.\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the situation, the lingering absence of a specific date for Super Bowl LXII in Atlanta is tied directly to the possibility of the season expanding for the 2027 season. With 17 games, the game would be played most likely on Sunday, February 13. With 18 games, it would slide to Sunday, February 20.\n\nAnd if 18 games comes with a second bye, the NFL likely would have to start the 2027 season on Labor Day weekend. That hasn't happened since 2001.\n\nLast Monday, Commissioner Roger Goodell said it's \"not a given\" that the regular-season will expand. The next day, interim NFL Players Association executive director David White said the players have \"no appetite\" for adding another game.\n\nOnce the NFLPA hires a permanent executive director, the league apparently plans to make a move on moving the season to 18. And the door for 18 by 2027 will remain open until Super Bowl LXII locks into February 13, 2028.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 season is complete after a thrilling Super Bowl. Now the work begins for all 32 teams to retool their roster and prepare for a potential playoff appearance next season. After an offensive coordinator and passing game coordinator change, the Eagles' roster will likely undergo further changes. The Birds have 21 players who'll test the restricted or unrestricted free-agent market during the 2026 NFL offseason. Several key factors include a pending contract extension for Jalen Carter and the contract status for star tight end Dallas Goedert.\n\nReed Blankenship is one of the biggest names on the list, and the defense could look drastically different with Nakobe Dean entering the final year of his rookie deal.\n\nWith the off-season officially underway in Philadelphia, we're looking at nine players who seem likely to depart.\n\nThe 27-year-old Uche played in 12 games and recorded 1 sack.\n\nOjulari saw action in three games before spending the bulk of the season on IR.\n\nThe 2022 sixth-round pick just finished his fourth season in the NFL, and likely played his last game in Philadelphia. A Former college teammate of Jalen Hurts at Oklahoma, eaching the end of his rookie contract. Calcaterra played in 62 games with 22 starts.\n\nA former Commanders first-round pick, Dotson spent two unproductive seasons with the Eagles, playing in 34 games and recording 37 catches on 69 targets for 478 yards and one regular-season touchdown.\n\nA versatile and solid lineman, the 29-year-old played 363 snaps at center and guard, allowing two sacks.\n\nThe Eagles acquired Howell via trade in August, making him the third-string quarterback. He didn't play a single game with the Eagles this season, but could certainly return.\n\nOkoronkwo played in just one game this season and landed on IR.\n\nDillon signed a one-year deal with Philadelphia after missing last season with a neck injury, but things didn't work out. The veteran running back lost his role when the Eagles brought in Tank Bigsby via trade. Dillon, 27, ended up with just 12 rushing attempts for 60 yards this season.\n\nThe Eagles signed Epps to their practice squad at the start of the season and eventually promoted him to the active roster. When rookie Drew Mukuba fractured his ankle, Epps regained his starting role at safety next to Blankenship.\n\nThe 30-year-old veteran signed a one-year deal with the Eagles in the offseason and improved for Vic Fangio as the season went on, outplaying Kelee Ringo and Jakorian Bennett.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Free Agency: 9 Eagles players who seem likely to depart",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump reacted forcefully to Super Bowl 60, calling for immediate change after what he described as a damaging moment for the NFL.\n\nFollowing the game, the former US president focused his criticism on the halftime show and quickly expanded his comments to include league policy.\n\nTrump shared his reaction in a post published by TrumpTruthOnX, responding directly to Bad Bunny’s halftime performance.\n\nHe wrote, “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, ever! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of success, creativity, or excellence.\n\n“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children who are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”\n\nThe comments were uncompromising and immediate. Trump framed the halftime show not as a matter of taste, but as a failure to reflect what he believes the Super Bowl should represent.\n\nAs has often been the case, Trump’s reaction quickly spread across social media, becoming part of the wider debate surrounding the NFL’s entertainment choices.\n\nTrump’s post did not stop at the halftime show. He also used the moment to call out a specific NFL rule change.\n\nHe continued, “This ‘show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the best Stock Market and 401(k)s in history!\n\n“There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a halftime show and watch, it will get great reviews from the fake news media, because they haven’t got a clue of what is going on in the real world, and, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new kickoff rule. Make America great again!”\n\nThe mention of the kickoff rule stood out. Rather than limiting his response to entertainment, Trump shifted attention to on-field changes introduced by the league.\n\nHis criticism suggested frustration with what he sees as unnecessary adjustments to the game itself.\n\nThe NFL’s revised kickoff rule, which was introduced in 2024, has already divided fans, with some praising the improvements and others arguing it removes excitement.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 fallout continues, the former president’s comments ensured the halftime show debate expanded beyond music.\n\nIt became, once again, a flashpoint for how sport, culture, and politics intersect on the biggest stage.\n\nDonald Trump goes off on ‘worst ever’ Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show\n\nImane Khelif has a brutal reminder for Donald Trump, names only way she will ‘respect’ the US President\n\nWho Donald Trump picked as Super Bowl LX winners between Patriots and Seahawks",

Walker became the first running back since Terrell Davis in 1998 to win Super Bowl MVP, a rare honor in today’s quarterback-driven NFL.\n\nIn his post-game interview, Walker described the achievement as almost unbelievable, saying it was “just a dream come true” because many players never even reach the Super Bowl, let alone win MVP.\n\nBut beyond the individual accolade, Walker highlighted the adversities the Seahawks overcame this season:\n\nHe thanked his teammates and emphasized the team’s resilience, noting, “We went through a lot of adversity this season, but we came together, and we stuck together, and this is what we got.”\n\nWalker shouldered a heavier workload down the stretch after Seattle’s offense lost running back Zach Charbonnet to a torn ACL in the playoffs, proving his ability to lead even through tough circumstances.\n\nWalker’s MVP performance not only helped deliver a Super Bowl title but also snapped a decades-long drought for running backs winning the MVP award, underscoring both how well he played and how meaningful the achievement was for his position.\n\nThe post Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III Recalls Seahawks’ Adversities After Winning What Saquon Barkley Couldn’t Last Year appeared first on The SportsRush.",

On one side is Sam Darnold, a veteran whose career has shifted gears over the past two seasons.

The reactions have been a mix of disbelief and jokes. Fans better have come hungry, because this is not some casual snack. They also better not have left their wallets at home.\n\nLevy Restaurants made just 200 of what they’re calling the LX Hammer Burger for Super Bowl Sunday.

Most people online cannot get past the price, calling it another case of Super Bowl excess.\n\nOne fan wrote, “I’d rather bite my thumb off and eat it rather than paying 180 for that. There is no doubts that the burger might be tasty, but for 180, nah. I’m expecting wagyu beef for that sum.”\n\nAnother commented, “At that price they can keep it\n\nalways eat somewhere other than the stadium!”\n\nThe most expensive concession item at Super Bowl LX is a $180 beef shank burger that feeds 4 people\n\n— Front Office Sports (@FOS) February 8, 2026\n\nSomeone else wrote, “Mortgage just for a burger.”\n\nAnother fan added, “The majority of the people that would buy these aren’t sitting in a regular seat.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen the Seattle Seahawks finally turn the page to the offseason, they'll have a big decision to make on running back Kenneth Walker.\n\nThat's because the former second-round pick is a pending free agent after spending all four of his NFL seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nHere's a look at who much Walker is expected to make in free agency.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Walker is estimated to land a four-year, $33.5 million deal in free agency, which is realistic for a few reasons.\n\nFor starters, Walker will be one of the best running backs available in free agency and should draw plenty of interest. Also, Walker has only helped his contract demands with a big showing in the playoffs.\n\nWhat will hurt Walker is the fact that he isn't the most complete back. He's OK as a pass-catcher and struggles in pass protection, so he won't be getting top-of-the-market money.\n\nThe good news for the Seahawks is they are loaded with cap space this offseason, so they'll have no issue re-signing Walker if that's the route they want to go.\n\nCardinals trade rumor could lead to deal with Steelers, Vikings or Browns\n\nAaron Rodgers career update is great news for Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n49ers trade rumor is crushing blow to possible deal with Vikings, Falcons\n\nMaxx Crosby isn't ruling out interesting career change down the line\n\nTravis Kelce rumor offers update on Chiefs superstar's future plans\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor is good news for Pats, Eagles, Cowboys",

    "fullText": "NFL legendary wide receiver Randy Moss didn’t mince words when addressing Pro Football Hall of Fame voters snubbing his former coach, Bill Belichick, from the Hall. Belichick’s name appeared on the ballot for the first time this year, but he will have to wait one more year to get inducted into the HOF.\n\nThe decision sparked plenty of reactions from former NFL players. Things got worse after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft also didn’t make it. During a Sunday appearance on ESPN’s “NFL Countdown,” Moss sent a strong message to the voters and the people who put them there. He stated that if they weren’t a player or a coach, they shouldn’t have a say on who gets in.\n\n“I’m not gon’ to really sit up here and just badmouth the Hall, ’cause there are some guys that just got selected to this year’s Pro Football Hall of Fame that I do not want to take the light from,” Moss said. “But one thing about not electing Robert Kraft, not electing Bill Belichick, the one thing that I would talk to all the voters. I really believe, as a football player, if you didn’t play it, if you didn’t coach it, you shouldn’t have a vote. I don’t care who you are, I don’t care how you feel about it. Like I said, I don’t wanna take no shine away from the guys elected today, and that’s it for me.”\n\n\"If you didn't play it, if you didn't coach it, you shouldn't have a vote.\"\n\n—@RandyMoss on Hall of Fame voting after Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were not selected\n\n— NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) February 8, 2026\n\nRandy Moss was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018, following a terrific career as one of the greatest wide receivers the game has ever seen. Eight years later, Belichick had the chance to join him in the Hall, but things didn’t go as expected.\n\nMoss wasn’t the only legend who thought former players and coaches should be the ones voting, not writers and journalists. On Friday, he told Kevin Clark on “This is Football” that only people already in the Hall of Fame should allow or deny entrance to candidates.\n\n“I wouldn’t want the grinch who stole Christmas voting on a beauty pageant,” Sanders said.\n\nDeion Sanders believes only Hall of Famers should vote on the Hall of Fame. \n\n\"I wouldnt want the grinch who stole Christmas voting on a beauty pageant. \"\n\nI said I think writers do a good job following the league.\n\n\"No, they don't\" -Coach Prime.\n\nIncredible This Is Football pic.twitter.com/wIUcIGXeDk\n\n— Kevin Clark (@bykevinclark) February 6, 2026\n\nThe Belichick situation could result in major changes in the voting process.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\n\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NFL legend Randy Moss goes off on HOF voters after Bill Belichick snub appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Sam Darnold has been facing challenges all throughout his time playing football since his days at San Clemente (Calif.). Now the former California high school football star will get his chance on the grandest stage of them all, Super Bowl LX, to show why he’s one of the best to have ever come out of the Golden State.\n\nThrough Darnold’s sophomore and junior seasons with the Tritons, the Super Bowl starting quarterback had seen minimal time on the field at San Clemente, totaling 748 yards and seven touchdowns. It would be Darnold’s senior year where the signal caller would blossom into his own before heading off to become a USC Trojan.\n\nDuring his senior campaign with the Tritons, Darnold had himself a strong season and ended up completing 213-of-314 passes for 2,985 yards and 39 touchdowns. The four-star prospect showed off his wheels on the ground, rushing for 785 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nAfter his high school playing days at San Clemente, Darnold was already committed to USC, making his decision during the summer of 2014 heading into his senior season and would head into a crowded quarterback room with the Trojans.\n\nPlaying two seasons at USC with a redshirt freshman campaign, the 6-foot-3, 221-pound passer completing 549-of-846 passes for 7,229 yards and 57 touchdowns before being selected as the No. 3 pick of the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Jets.\n\nNow heading into Sunday’s Super Bowl matchup with the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Darnold has a chance one more time to prove the naysayers wrong and overcoming one more challenge in his path.\n\n“Sam Darnold was sort of a late bloomer (in high school). USC had their quarterback room all set and it was gonna go from (Cody) Kessler to Ricky Town. A lot of schools early on wanted Sam to play tight end. The issue at that time he wasn’t doing a lot of camps or 7-on-7. First time I saw him at Mission Viejo 7-on-7 tournament and he was outstanding. He made all the the grows and was superb. The way his recruitment went, he to a camp at USC and Clay Helton was the HC at the time. The staff said they had to go after him at the time after seeing him. Oregon, Duke were also after him during the recruitment him. Darnold and his dad went to a lot of USC games. I think that’s a testament to his fortitude. Is it surprising, certainly. Just knowing him and his HC. Knowing he’s a tough kid. He was walking into a very tough QB at USC and he stayed resilient.” – Rivals National Recruiting reporter Adam Gorney\n\nSan Clemente High School, located in the coastal town of San Clemente, California, serves around 3,000 students from the city and surrounding areas, including Capistrano Beach and San Juan Capistrano. Established in 1964, the school is part of the Capistrano Unified School District and boasts a robust athletics program with a strong community presence under the motto “One Town, One Team.” The Tritons are recognized for their competitive spirit across various sports disciplines.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "To prepare the field for an NFL game in less than 18 hours, crews have to strip and repaint the field, clean 2 million square feet of stadium space, and fire up thousands of meals in crowded kitchens, all in a matter of hours.\n\nThe first step in clearing the field and prepping for it to be painted with the Falcons' logo is collecting roughly 5 million pieces of confetti launched from confetti cannons.\n\nCleanup crews use rakes, leaf blowers, and utility vehicles fitted with large nets to collect every last piece — even the smallest piece of debris can interfere with repainting the turf.\n\nThe paint removal process takes around one to two hours to complete.\n\nTo speed things up, P-Rex machines spray a cleaning solution onto painted logos and use spinning brushes and a vacuum to remove the paint.\n\nThe process is surprisingly precise. Too many chemicals can soak the turf, and too much pressure can permanently damage the field.\n\nEvery area has to be cleared of waste, including the private suites, locker rooms, kitchens, and stadium bowl seating.\n\nIn the seating bowl, workers hand-pick everything from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to food containers and pom-poms, with each person assigned a specific type of waste to speed up sorting.\n\nAfter trash is collected from the stands, power-washing crews race behind the waste-collecting crews, scrubbing away spills and sticky residue before the next crowd arrives.\n\nEven though waste is pre-sorted, each bag still has to be inspected.\n\nThe goal: recycle or compost 96% of all waste generated during the event.\n\nOnce paint is removed from the field, the turf must completely dry before repainting can begin.\n\nGrounds crews use this small window of time to prep stencils and get ready to tackle the \"hot areas\" of the field — the center logo and the end zones — which are the most time-consuming.\n\nThe logo is hand-painted using spraying machines that ensure accuracy.\n\nCrews have to pay special attention to the sidelines and end zones to ensure everything is up to code before kickoff.\n\nAbout 100 cooks prepare different menus for concessions, suites, catering, and eight all-inclusive clubs — some serving up to 1,000 people.\n\nAt this game, the stadium's food team sold more than 25,000 hot dogs, 10,000 slices of pizza, and over 5,000 pounds of wings.\n\nThe menu changes for every event, and food is largely prepared in a central kitchen and distributed to multiple secondary kitchens throughout the stadium.\n\nExecutive chef Matt Cooper told Business Insider that having detailed boards allows him to keep track of his massive team and ensure everything runs smoothly.\n\n\"This is the magic behind everything we do,\" he said. \"We have all the chefs, all the supervisors, junior sous chefs, all the cooks, and we're able to kind of move the pieces around. It's a big kitchen, a lot of space, and I love being able to kind of visualize and see the whole team.\"\n\nAt the same time, club spaces are stocked with fruit and sandwich trays, employees place fan giveaway items on every seat inside the stadium, and excitement builds for kickoff.\n\nLights flash, cameras roll, fans cheer, and players take the field, with most of the stadium's attendees oblivious to the overnight operation that made it all happen.\n\nWhen the final whistle blows, it's mere hours before employees at Mercedes-Benz Stadium start planning for the next event.",

    "description": "Iowa State's \"Big Citrus\" offers size and surprising athleticism. Could Domonique Orange be the run-stuffing force the Green Bay Packers desperately need?",
    "fullText": "It may feel a bit too early to start thinking about the 2026 NFL Draft, but mock draft season will be upon us before you know it. In fact, for many fans, mock draft season started the minute the Green Bay Packers' 2025 season ended.\n\nA lot is going to happen between now and April 23rd, when the draft kicks off in Pittsburgh. Right now, the Packers don't have a first-round pick, and they'll start their selections with pick No. 52, which is in the second round.\n\nNot having a first-rounder in the 2026 and 2027 NFL Drafts was part of the price the Packers paid for getting Micah Parsons. They gave a lot to get a lot back in return, and that's just part of the reality general manager Brian Gutekunst will have to work with unless he's able to swing another trade and somehow get back into the first round.\n\nSo who should the Packers target in Round 2 and beyond? There are going to be a ton of names thrown around and many of them will be great picks.\n\nEarlier this week, we focused on Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker.\n\nNow, let's talk about Iowa State defensive lineman Domonique Orange:\n\nOrange may have the best nickname in the 2026 NFL Draft, and you can absolutely make the case that he has one of the best nicknames of all time.\n\nThey call him \"Big Citrus\", and there's a reason for that. Orange checks in at 6-foot-4, 325 pounds.\n\nHe's a big dude, and he knows what to do with his size.\n\nOrange is a run-stuffer, without a doubt. He's the guy you put at nose-tackle or one technique and ask him to take up a double team. The thing about him, though, is that he's surprisingly athletic for his size.\n\nNobody is going to confuse him with Devonte Wyatt, who is actually a great pass-rusher for being 6-foot-3, 304 pounds, but \"Big Citrus\" has the quick-twitch to be able to shoot the gap, and he's good at using his hands to get blockers off him.\n\nDomonique Orange (95) aligned head up on the RT before penetrating and eating the RB\n\nBig Citrus with a healthy dose of vitamin C-eek and destroy. Get it? Thank you for your time\n\n pic.twitter.com/lybgr8haI9\n\n— Anthony Cover 1 (@Pro__Ant) February 6, 2026\n\nThe Packers struggled a bit against the run this past season, averaging 117.7 yards per game given up on the ground.\n\nAdding Orange to this offensive line would go a long way. Speaking of Wyatt, he should be healthy by the start of the 2026 season, so new defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon would be able to pair him and Orange together on the inside. Both of those players will demand double-teams, but so does Micah Parsons on the edge.\n\nOrange is projected as a third-round pick but the Packers would absolutely be justified taking him in the second round. Even if they don't select him at No. 52, there's a chance he's still there at pick No. 84 in the third round, but if they like him, they may want to jump on him while they're able to in round two.\n\nPackersRoundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "description": "The daughter of NFL Hall of Famer Tom Mack reflects on growing up with a legendary player who balanced football, work, and family.",
    "fullText": "On the occasion of my father's 82nd birthday, I called him to wish him well. As we chatted, I told him about a social media post shared by his former team, the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nMy dad doesn't pay attention to social media, so he wouldn't know that the post had garnered hundreds of likes and comments. Many fans wished him a happy birthday, while others recalled his skill on the field and their favorite memories of watching him play.\n\n\"That's neat,\" my father said in his understated manner. I could hear the smile in his voice.\n\nMy father, Tom Mack, was an offensive lineman for the Los Angeles Rams from 1966 through 1978. He played in 184 consecutive games over 13 seasons, served as team captain, and was named to 11 Pro Bowls. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nBut to me, he's just my dad. He walks his dog, attends church, and shops at Walmart. People usually don't recognize him as one of the game's all-time greats.\n\nWhen I was growing up as the daughter of an NFL player in the 1970s, there were definitely some perks, like the trip our family took to Hawaii when my dad participated in a celebrity rodeo. After home games, my two sisters and I, along with my mom, would greet our dad outside his locker room at the Los Angeles Coliseum. My sisters and I would run around with our autograph books getting signatures from teammates, including Merlin Olsen and Jack Youngblood.\n\nI admit I'm a bit jealous of today's NFL kids, who seem to get on the field regularly. I only stepped on the field with my dad once, for the Pro Bowl in 1979, his final game.\n\nWhile going on the field was rare, seeing him on television was another perk of having an NFL dad, especially back when there were so few channels. He was interviewed on the news and appeared in local commercials. It was especially exciting when he guest-starred on the popular series \"Six Million Dollar Man,\" playing a bad guy in a slow-motion football match against Lee Majors as Steve Austin.\n\nIt wasn't all glamorous, though. Even though he played 13 seasons, his entire career occurred before the advent of cable TV and huge salaries.\n\nIn fact, my dad and his teammates worked other jobs during the offseason. Some of them sold cars or real estate, while my dad worked as a mechanical engineer for a global engineering and construction company.\n\nAs a kid, I didn't think of my dad as someone with two careers. I just knew he went to work. What mattered to me was that he ate dinner with us and came to my soccer games and ballet recitals.\n\nOther people, however, seemed far more interested in what he didn't have.\n\nMy sisters and I were athletic and enjoyed playing sports when women's sports were in their infancy. People asked us constantly if we had any brothers. Whenever I replied no, I was struck by how many strangers asked, \"Didn't your dad want sons?\"\n\nMy dad never made me feel like he wanted sons, and my mom echoed that. He had grown up in the shadow of his own father, who played Major League Baseball, and knew the weight that came with that legacy. He always told me he was happy to raise girls without the pressure to follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhen he retired at the end of the 1978 NFL season, he went to work full-time as an engineer, and my family left the football world behind. Surprisingly, we moved across the country more for his engineering career than for football.\n\nWhen he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999, it was fun to revisit his career. Each summer, he returns to Canton, Ohio, for enshrinement weekend, reconnecting with teammates and other legends. The Rams organization treats him well, too, checking in and welcoming him back to games.\n\nI love it when fans recognize him. When it does, fans get stars in their eyes. From the time I was a little girl until now, I've witnessed my dad remain humble and gracious with every fan he meets.\n\nI think of him not as one of the NFL's greatest players, but simply as my dad. He modeled hard work and humility with a dash of humor, remaining competitive even off the field — he never lost a board game to my sisters or me until we could beat him on our own merit. He took me fishing and camping, taught me to drive a stick shift, and walked me down the aisle.\n\nHe may have been a legendary football player, but I'd argue he's an even greater dad.",

A black-and-white photo of a ceremonial mask in an old art book revealed the inspiration behind the design, which was then traced to a collection at the Hudson Museum in Maine.\n\nThe museum sent the mask to Seattle on loan, where a ceremony was held featuring both tribal members and team representatives.\n\nThe mask, which was created in the late 1800s and was carved from cedar, had been in private collections since leaving Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where it was created by members of the Kwakwaka'wakw Nation, says Katie Bunn-Marcuse, the curator of Northwest Native Art at the Burke Museum.\n\nThe carving, which is known as a \"transformational mask\" and depicts the ancestral origins of one's family, was created around the time that Canada introduced a ban on many indigenous practices, in a move which decimated many tribes in western Canada.\n\nUsing the mask for its intended purpose, at large gatherings called potlaches, became a crime. Many people went to jail for their cultural practices, however, the Kwakwaka'wakw people continued to hold underground potlaches.\n\n\"The Indian Act banned people gathering and performing their songs,\" says Bunn-Marcuse, adding, that \"the potlatch was the economic and legal system of the coast\". The ban was lifted in 1951, and in 2015 Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that it was part of a \"cultural genocide\", which also included the notorious residential school programme, which separated families and erased local languages.\n\nWatts grew up on a reservation in Port Alberni on the west side of Vancouver Island, in his father's tribal community. But after the discovery of the logo's Kwakwaka'wakw origins, he decided to look into his mother's family history on the other side of the island.\n\nTravelling back to Vancouver Island, he set out on a series of tribal canoe journeys, where he reconnected with Kwakwaka'wakw family members and learned more about their cultural practices.\n\nDuring one trip, he was invited to take place in a ritual in which he was declared a \"warrior\", or guardian of the tribe's culture.\n\n\"I had to dance half-naked in front of a thousand people, and then I came back in warriors clothing. To me it's like being baptised as a Christian. It really changed my life.\"\n\nBruce Alfred, an artist living in Alert Bay, British Columbia, recalls when his cousin started showing up, inspired by his commitment to the Seahawks and his cultural heritage. He says that Watts is not the only person who has been inspired by the NFL team to look into their family history.\n\nAlfred was part of the Burke team that surveyed the mask, and confirmed that it was indeed Kwakwaka'wakw, and had been used in spiritual ceremonies before going into a private collection.\n\n\"After the potlatch ban they took everything away from our people,\" he says, adding that the goal of the government and missionaries was to \"annihilate and assimilate us - either one\".\n\nThe Seahawks are popular throughout Canada's western coast, where no other NFL team exists. Alfred says that many people in his village are Seahawks supporters, and that more people have been inspired to look into their heritage after discovering the team's connection. It comes amid a larger tribal movement to reconnect with the past.\n\n\"There is a resurgence of our people that are stepping up and they're learning the language, the culture, their own identity,\" he says.\n\nAlfred, and other indigenous people who spoke to the BBC, say that unlike other major league sports teams, the Seahawks logo has not sparked backlash because it respectfully borrows from indigenous culture, rather than plays in to racist stereotypes.\n\nThe display of indigenous cultural materials as artworks has been criticised by some tribal people, who see these as sacred tools for worship.\n\nAt the Kwakwaka'wakw exhibit at the University of British Columbia's Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver, one mask is kept under a sheet to symbolically show how some believe these objects should not be displayed, and only taken out for important occasions.\n\nThe debate is always ongoing for museums that display indigenous relics, says Bunn-Marcuse.\n\n\"In community, many of these masks are not brought out until the moment that they are needed,\" she says.\n\n\"Whenever we do our exhibits we do them collaboratively with input and advising by community members. So there are some masks that we no longer show because community has said those are not appropriate to be shown ever outside of their ceremonial context.\"\n\nOthers have critiqued the artwork for originating from a tribe that is hundreds of miles from Seattle, halfway to Alaska. The artwork of local peoples such as the Coast Salish could be used instead, they argue.\n\nQwalsius-Shaun Peterson, a Coast Salish artist from the Puyallup Tribe near Tacoma, Washington, is among many indigenous artists who have redesigned unofficial Seahawks logos in the style of their own local culture.\n\n\"People within the tribal communities are just really excited about native iconography of any kind,\" he says.\n\n\"Nobody takes offense\" to the official logo, he adds, adding that it is not a \"misrepresentation\" and instead \"borrows from\" indigenous art.\n\nWatts, who proudly boasts that he's the first person to arrive at games and the last to leave, is using his celebrity status as a superfan to fund raise for multiple charities.\n\nHe also cooks at a food bank, and mentors Native American youths in prison.\n\n\"I really had a different outlook on my entire life\" after connecting with the roots of the logo, Watts says.\n\n\"We're supposed to be the guardians of our tribe. We protect and provide.\"\n\nTotem pole to return to dockland home\n\nAn underwater mystery on Canada's coast\n\nA surprising way of showing gratitude",

    "fullText": "The early round talent in the 2026 NFL draft seems to align fairly well with where the Jacksonville Jaguars' greatest needs are.\n\nJordan Reid of ESPN recently put together his top 50 prospects big board, with a number of the players represented playing positions that should be on GM James Gladstone's radar this offseason.\n\nAs we look at the current state of the Jaguars' roster, this looks like it could be an offseason where GM James Gladstone invests fairly heavily into the defensive side of the ball.\n\nCornerback is a need with Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome both free agents. Defensive end and defensive tackle depth are needs -- not to mention that the Jaguars could use more pass rush juice from the interior.\n\nThen, depending on whether or not Devin Lloyd returns, that will determine how big of a need linebacker is.\n\nOn offense, adding to the offensive line and tight end positions could be on Gladstone's radar. Depth at most positions is always welcomed as well.\n\nAfter trading up for Travis Hunter in last year's draft, the Jaguars do not own their first-round pick this year. However, these rankings help us identify the strengths of this year's draft class.\n\nBelow is a positional breakdown of how Reid's top 50 big board shook out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: 2026 NFL draft: How latest big board aligns with Jaguars needs",

    "description": "An NFL insider has named the Detroit Lions as a serious trade contender for Raiders star Maxx Crosby. Here’s why the fit makes sense.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions just got pulled into one of the biggest trade rumors of the entire offseason.\n\nDuring Super Bowl LX week, NFL insider Jeremy Fowler of ESPN named the Lions as one of several “natural would-be contenders” to pursue Raiders star defensive end Maxx Crosby, a revelation that immediately caught the attention of fans across the league.\n\nThe timing isn’t accidental. Earlier in the week, Fox Sports insider Jay Glazer reported that Crosby may be “done” with Las Vegas, setting off widespread speculation about where one of the NFL’s most relentless pass rushers could land next.\n\nDetroit is firmly in win-now mode, and the idea of pairing Crosby with Aidan Hutchinson is the kind of move that could change the balance of power in the NFC.\n\nCrosby has been one of the league’s most consistent edge defenders over the last seven seasons, earning two All-Pro selections and five Pro Bowl nods. Adding him opposite Hutchinson would give the Lions one of the most feared pass-rush duos in football — something this defense has lacked in high-leverage playoff moments.\n\nAccording to Fowler, Crosby’s priority is clear:\n\n“What has been made clear to me: Crosby wants to be a part of a winner. That’s the priority.”\n\nThat alone puts Detroit squarely in the conversation.\n\nFowler reported that trade interest in Crosby is massive, with more than a dozen teams expected to at least inquire. Among the contenders he specifically listed were the Bills, Lions, 49ers, Cowboys, and Ravens — a group made up almost entirely of Super Bowl-caliber teams.\n\nCrosby has remained loyal to the Raiders throughout his career, but Fowler noted that loyalty could soon be tested. Las Vegas is still far from contention, and Crosby is approaching the heart of his prime.\n\nAny Crosby trade would come at a steep cost — both in draft capital and money.\n\nIf Detroit were to acquire him, Crosby would carry a 2026 cap hit north of $30 million, though he does come with four years of team control after signing a three-year, $106.5 million extension last offseason.\n\nThat number is significant, but for a franchise pushing for its first Super Bowl appearance, it’s the type of financial swing that front offices sometimes decide is worth it.\n\nStatistically, Crosby is exactly what Detroit would be buying:\n\nProven durability and leadership\n\nThe Lions already have their defensive cornerstone in Hutchinson. What they don’t yet have is the elite second edge rusher who forces quarterbacks to pick their poison.\n\nThat’s why the Crosby rumors won’t die anytime soon.\n\nWhether Detroit actually pulls the trigger is another question — but according to ESPN, the Lions are very much in the mix.\n\nThe post NFL Insider Links Detroit Lions to Maxx Crosby appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "Daniel Kolcun didn't hesitate — the day after he was let go from his job, he founded his company Gridiron Football Prep, and got to work.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Daniel Kolcun, owner of Gridiron Football Prep. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI got let go from my job in 2021 as part of a companywide reduction.\n\nAt the time, I had been working in football product management at Wilson Sporting Goods, overseeing football products and working with teams, factories, and leather suppliers across college and professional football.\n\nWherever I went, the same topic of discussion came up: What's the best way to break in a football?\n\nI had been preparing footballs for years as an add-on service within my role for select teams.\n\nDuring COVID, that service expanded when equipment managers didn't have access to their facilities; they would ask for help, and I'd stay late, come in on weekends, or use downtime to prep footballs so they were ready to use.\n\nOver time, I learned how leather behaves in different weather, which products hold up, how to customize prep options to meet quarterbacks' needs, and which processes are duplicative.\n\nAfter the layoff, I had teams who were interested in continuing to work with me. So the day after I was let go, I started an LLC for my company, Gridiron Football Prep.\n\nI run Gridiron Football Prep out of my home in New Jersey with my wife, Emily, who handles product development and business operations. The workload is intense. At any given time, there can be hundreds of footballs in different stages of preparation — brushed, conditioned, balmed, mudded, and drying.\n\nWhen a football leaves the factory, it's missing key elements that prevent it from performing at the highest level. Quarterbacks may find it too slick, too stiff, or inconsistent in moisture, which can affect how the ball feels in their hands. Prepping a football to a quarterback's specific needs, so it feels more worn, tacky, soft, and usable in addition to performing better in different weather conditions.\n\nEvery football goes through a custom, multi-step process. There's brushing to open the leather's pores, conditioning to soften it, balming to add controlled tack, heat to bake products into the leather, and mudding to even the surface and help with moisture management.\n\nThe mud I use comes from New Jersey. I apply it by hand, so it spreads evenly across the leather and acts as an emulsifier, bringing the ball's natural tack to the surface. It also helps manage moisture and gives the football a more consistent color and feel.\n\nThe hands-on work averages at least 30 minutes per ball, but drying time stretches a full batch to about 72 hours. During peak season, I aim to finish roughly 50 footballs a day.\n\nOrders vary. Some college programs send 150 to 200 footballs before a season. Professional teams can go through hundreds over the course of a year. My pricing typically ranges from about $40 to $75 per ball, depending on volume, customization, and turnaround time.\n\nThe goal is simple: I don't want the quarterback thinking about the ball. If they're thinking about grip, something went wrong.\n\nFootball has been a part of my life for decades. I played the sport through high school and college, then stayed in the space through equipment work and product development roles over the years.\n\nI still watch football like a former player, but now I see it through a different lens — one shaped by deadlines, weather forecasts, and preparation cycles. Most of the time, the work I do doesn't show up on screen because that means the football is performing the way it's supposed to.\n\nThen there's the occasional snap where it matters. That might only be 1%. But sometimes, that 1% is enough to justify building a business around it.\n\nI never made it to the NFL as a player, but this is how I contribute to the game now.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDespite decades of public relations attempts to try and make the NFL seem safe, San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle says the game is growing increasingly more dangerous and violent and “it should be that way.”\n\nKittle is one of several key players on the 49ers that suffered a major injury this season, but that doesn’t change his belief that football is meant to be a violent sport.\n\nWith his ankle still in a boot, Kittle appeared Friday on the “Pat McAfee Show” on Radio Row at Super Bowl 60, where he said he’s excited about recovery process.\n\nMORE: George Kittle on Christian McCaffrey turning off Wi-Fi over substation theory\n\nIt was also clear in an exchange with McAfee that Kittle wants the NFL to stop “making to easy” on the quarterbacks.\n\n“I think they still need to work on roughing the passer. I think that’s outrageous still,” Kittle said. “If you get hit in the head … I don’t think that should be a thing unless you get hit helmet-to-helmet on a quarterback. If a (defensive lineman) is swiping to hit a ball and you accidentally hit the quarterback in the head that shouldn’t be a 15-yard penalty. Stop making it so easy on offenses.”\n\nMORE: 49ers injury conspiracy theory, explained: Experts debunk link to Levi’s Stadium electric substation from viral post\n\nKittle is very familiar with one team in the Super Bowl – the Seattle Seahawks. The division foes played each other three times this season.\n\n“Their defense reminds me of the defense I had in 2019,” Kittle said. “They come off the ball, they hit you in the face really, really hard. They penetrate against the line of scrimmage; your offensive line is always in the backfield and their DBs take advantage of that. When you only have to rush four guys, especially when you have elite defensive tackles on the inside, then your DBs are only covering for three, four seconds instead of five, six seconds.”\n\n8 closest NFL MVP votes ever, from 2003 and 1997 ties to first (and only) kicker to win\n\nSam Darnold teams timeline: Full history of QB's NFL career, from Jets bust to 49ers backup to Seahawks stardom\n\nChristian McCaffery hints at 49ers reunion with All-Pro WR\n\n49ers get great news on Rams matchup in 2026 with NFL's Australia announcement",

    "fullText": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Raiders star pass rusher Maxx Crosby said Friday any talk of wanting out of Las Vegas did not come from him.\n\nOne NFL reporter said this week he expected Crosby to be traded because the seven-year veteran didn't want to go through another rebuild. Another NFL reporter said Crosby was especially interested in playing for New England coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nSpeaking from the team facility, Crosby said Friday on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” that he intentionally hasn't spoken publicly this offseason because he learned he “can't control everything.”\n\n“Now that I'm quiet, I've got random people making big statements for me,” said Crosby, wearing a Raiders sweatshirt and skull cap. \"They're like, ‘Maxx must’ve told them this.' For me, I just sit back and laugh because I know my truth and when I go to bed at night, I have a smile on my face because I don't have to explain nothing to nobody.\n\n“I'm getting healthy. I'm in the building every single day. I'm in this building from 6 a.m. when it's dark out, and I'm here until almost 2. ... That's all I care about, so all the noise, that's news to me sometimes.\"\n\nSpeculation about Crosby's future with the Raiders ramped up late last season when the club placed him on injured reserve with two games left because of a knee injury. Crosby was not pleased about the decision and left the building.\n\nThe five-time Pro Bowler could attract a strong trade offer if the Raiders go that route. They are about to enter their third season in a row with a different head coach, with Seattle offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak expected to take the job after Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nLas Vegas comes off a 3-14 record, but will have the first pick in the draft and more than $91 million in salary cap space, according to overthecap.com.\n\nCrosby has had double-digit sacks three of the past four years, and this season had a career-high 28 tackles for loss.\n\nHe said his focus is on rehabilitating from left knee surgery that took place about a month ago.\n\n“I'm ahead of schedule, and it's business as usual,” Crosby said. “It's my eighth surgery in seven years. It's something that I've gotten used to. It's all about perspective, about how you approach what you want to accomplish. I'm willing to run that marathon.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza drops major hint about preferred NFL team originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza insists his focus remains squarely on the NFL Draft process. But the projected No. 1 overall pick and Heisman Trophy winner revealed a bit of his future during a TV interview Friday.\n\nWhile on The Pat McAfee Show, the former Indiana quarterback detailed the offensive systems he has studied in preparation for the next level. In doing so, Mendoza went out of his way to praise Klint Kubiak and the structure of the scheme associated with his coaching tree.\n\n“We actually had a little bit of a Kubiak, kind of McVay system,” Mendoza said, citing his familiarity with outside zone runs, play action concepts and bootlegs. He also pointed to Kubiak’s work with quarterbacks, including the recent development of Sam Darnold, as particularly impressive.\n\nThe breakdown also shows Mendoza is way beyond his years in terms of football IQ. He's able to recognize parts of the game other signal callers tend to gloss over at his age. He noted he was following Kubiak’s offensive breakdowns well before reports linked him to the head coaching vacancy with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nFernando Mendoza says on @TheHerd that he was a huge fan of Tom Brady growing up:\n\n“I read the TB12 book. I was always big on preparation. Because, like Tom, I’m not the biggest, I’m not the fastest, I’m not the strongest. But the edge is in the intellect and preparation.” https://t.co/4VogMUSIaJpic.twitter.com/28IDsgpH2m\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) February 6, 2026\n\nAs examples of how the right structure can accelerate a rebuild, Mendoza referenced the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, franchises he said quickly shifted from the margins to championship contention.\n\nIndiana's Heisman also spoke highly about Tom Brady, who is now a minority owner with the Raiders. Mendoza told Colin Cowherd that Brady’s preparation and discipline resonated deeply with him, particularly given his own lightly recruited background.\n\nMore: Bill Belichick's girlfriend heats up Tom Brady reunion talk\n\nWith Las Vegas holding the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and widely expected to target Mendoza, the connections are difficult to overlook.\n\nWhile he maintains that development remains his priority, Mendoza’s comments suggested a quarterback already envisioning the right fit and perhaps the right franchise for his NFL future.\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nJimmy Kimmel roasts Bill Belichick’s girlfriend over Hall of Fame debate\n\nEx-Indiana QB fires back after portrayal in CBS 60 Minutes interview\n\nSkip Holtz provides update on his father's condition\n\nJason Whitlock slams Shedeur Sanders says 'NFL's Jake Paul' didn't earn Pro Bowl",

    "description": "The NFL will take two of its most iconic teams to two of the world's most iconic stadiums next season, so what is the league's plan and what do its players think?",
    "fullText": "The NFL's bid to capture the attention of the world's sports fans appears to know no bounds.\n\nAmerica's biggest sports league had already confirmed it will make its debut at two of the world's most iconic stadiums next season - Rio de Janeiro's Maracana and the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n\nThen on Thursday, it used its biggest week of the year to announce that two of its most iconic franchises will be playing there.\n\nWith most activities for Super Bowl week being held in San Francisco, Thursday's news that the 49ers will be heading to Australia created a buzz in 'The City'.\n\nThen a few hours later it was revealed that the Dallas Cowboys - known as 'America's Team' - will head to Brazil for the NFL's first game in Rio.\n\n\"Introducing one of the league's most iconic teams to the Maracana Stadium marks a powerful milestone in the continued growth of the sport worldwide,\" said Luis Martinez, general manager of NFL Brazil.\n\nThe Cowboys' opponent and date for the game are yet to be confirmed. The 49ers will face the Los Angeles Rams, with the game expected to take place near the start of the season in September.\n\nNFL executives have repeatedly mentioned the league's desire to become a \"true global sport property\" and they will stage a record nine international games in 2026 - across four continents, seven countries and eight stadiums.\n\nWhere the Super Bowl will be won and lost\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nThe NFL's international presence has expanded dramatically over the past couple of years.\n\nFive international games during the 2024 season increased to seven in 2025, and nine will be played abroad in 2026.\n\nThat has included expanding into Brazil, Spain and Ireland, with Australia and France new territories for 2026, when there will also be a return to Mexico.\n\nNext season there will be games in London (three), Madrid, Melbourne, Mexico City, Munich, Paris and Rio.\n\n\"We're in several new markets, we're excited by that,\" said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell this week.\n\n\"It's the ambition that we have to be a global sport, but it's also the demand that we're having. We're hearing from cities all over the world that want to host these games and they really want to get more American football.\"\n\nGoodell has mentioned venturing into Asia while Abu Dhabi is one of the cities where the NFL has conducted a site visit to examine the possibility of playing a game there.\n\nThis week he reiterated that his ultimate goal is to play 16 international games each season, meaning each of the NFL's 32 teams would play overseas once a year.\n\n\"I think that's an important mark for us to go for, and I think we're well on our way,\" Goodell added.\n\nMini Super Bowls & Christmas games - NFL's bid to become 'truly global'\n\nTwo west coast teams were expected to make the journey for the NFL's first game in Australia, to minimise the impact of travel.\n\nAnd the Rams have been handed an encounter with divisional rivals the 49ers, who have also been regular Super Bowl contenders in recent years, so it makes for an appealing match-up.\n\nAfter being named this season's Most Valuable Player in San Francisco on Thursday, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford said: \"It seems like a long flight, and I hope my back's not too sore afterwards, to be honest with you.\n\n\"But I am excited about it, it's a really cool opportunity. Playing an unbelievable team like the 49ers is going to be a huge challenge. It's a fun rivalry so I think the fans in Australia are going to get a great game.\"\n\nDavid White, interim executive director of the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA) said this week: \"Our members appreciate the global stage. They understand the excitement that the games are generating around the world.\n\n\"But we've got a lot of feedback about not having good experiences because it's inconsistent. It's a seemingly arbitrary approach that clubs take to travel.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nBefore this season's game at Wembley, for example, the Jacksonville Jaguars flew out to London early in the week, while the Rams arrived the day before the game and returned to LA immediately after their 35-7 win.\n\n\"Some teams will stay near the practice site, some will have lengthy commutes for the players after that travel, when they're getting over jet leg,\" said White. \"It depends which team they play for, so it's the lack of standardisation that feels arbitrary.\n\n\"The game requires a certain amount of rest, preparation and restoration in order for players to be safe, so all of that needs to be accounted for if we're going to talk about [travelling] even further away or having more international games. That's a matter of negotiation.\"\n\nThe NFL's current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the NFLPA allows up to 10 regular-season games to held overseas per season.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings became the first team to have two international games in the same season in 2025, playing in Dublin and London on successive Sundays, and linebacker Jonathan Greenard said he \"would not like to do back-to-back [again]\".\n\nBut White said players gave a \"good deal of positive feedback because of the way they went about it. That is the trick.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is possible that 16 games worldwide gets to be too much, but that's for the players to decide once they have all the information.\n\n\"We do have some sense of what makes a positive experience when travelling internationally, and we're collecting data.\n\n\"It's about making sure that the players are at the centre of that debate.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Why Justin Herbert's first-place MVP vote is odd twist to Matthew Stafford victory over Drake Maye originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL was very close to having co-league MVP quarterbacks for the second time ever and first time in 22 years. Instead, the Rams' Matthew Stafford's margin of victory -- one first-place vote -- over the Patriots' Drake Maye (24-23) will go down as the closest decision in league history.\n\nNot since the Colts' Peyton Manning and the late Titans great Steve McNair tied 16-16 and shared MVP in 2003 has there been such a narrow call. Stafford edging Maye was the most expected result at Thursday's Associated Press NFL Honors ceremony, but it still came with controversy considering where the three other first-place votes went.\n\nWhile 47 of the 50 AP voters, which includes national beat reporters and television analysts such as Tom Brady, had a natural split between Stafford and Maye -- much like Josh Allen beating Lamar Jackson for 2024 MVP -- three went in a different direction. Two voters thought Allen should repeat and gave him a follow-up first-place love. But one inexplicably threw away their most valuable vote on Justin Herbert.\n\nMORE:How Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye in closest race since 2003\n\nThere was some logic to Allen's season with the Bills being worthy of some recognition, given it was more efficient than his winning year in many ways. But Herbert's year with the Chargers shouldn't have had a real case.\n\nHerbert wasn't even one of the five finalists \"nominated\" at the 2026 NFL Honors. Stafford, Maye and Allen were joined by Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence and 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who both didn't get any first place votes.\n\nBefore the AP reveals on Friday how all 50 voters ranked their top five from first to fifth, the Herbert voter outed himself -- it was former Pro Football Focus analyst Sam Monson.\n\nI was the Justin Herbert vote.\n\nThe guy had the worst offensive line in the NFL all season and despite that he was working miracles in almost every single game.\n\nStafford's OL became 2/5ths as bad as Herbert's for 5 minutes and he became a turnover howitzer.\n\nHe embodied 'value'.\n\n— Sam Monson (@SamMonsonNFL) February 6, 2026\n\nHerbert did have to deal with a broken-down offensive line with both top offensive tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt going down with season-ending injuries. He was sacked 54 times and the Chargers gave up 60 as a team.\n\nBut Maye also was sacked a ton, 47 times, with his rookie left tackle Will Campbell battling inexperience and injury. Maye led the league in completion percentage (72.0), yards per pass attempt (8.9) and passer rating (113.5). He also rushed for 450 yards.\n\nStafford led the league with his 4,709 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes while averaging 7.9 yards per attempt and rating 109.2.\n\nHerbert's numbers weren't close to either. He averaged 7.3 yards per attempt and rated 94.1. He threw for only 26 TDs with 13 interceptions while passing for fewer than 4,000 yards (3,727 yards). Those kind of mediocre numbers lack both efficiency and profilic nature, two things that count most in the history of the award, with MVP really being \"the best quarterback in the league award\".\n\nMORE:Matthew Stafford says he’s not retiring in 2026 NFL MVP Speech\n\nEvery quarterback that wins MVP has a favorable support system. Herbert might have been let down by his team, but in the end, MVP is an award for individual performance. Had Herbert put up transcendent numbers with those challenges, it's one thing. But one cannot blame Stafford or Maye for having better all-around support systems and taking full advantage.\n\nHerbert didn't deserve that vote, or even a fifth-place one.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Honors celebrated the defining performances and stories of the 2025 season, recognizing excellence that went far beyond the box score. From veteran stars reaching new heights to emerging talents announcing their arrival, this year’s winners reflected the league’s unique blend of longevity, resilience, and evolution. Together, these awards capture the moments and individuals who shaped the NFL’s narrative over the past season.\n\nMatthew Stafford captured his first NFL MVP award after a remarkable 17th season in the league. He led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes. His performance was a career-high and pivotal in the Rams’ offensive success, showcasing both precision and longevity at age 37. Stafford’s journey from years of underappreciated play in Detroit to peak form in Los Angeles adds a compelling arc to his MVP narrative. Despite his veteran status, he announced intentions to continue playing, hinting at even more chapters ahead.\n\nSmith-Njigba emerged as the league’s top offensive weapon, setting franchise records and finishing with 1,793 receiving yards — the most in the NFL for the 2025 season. His route running, consistency, and ability to create separation made him a matchup nightmare for defenses. He became the focal point of Seattle’s attack and proved he’s more than just a deep threat, becoming a true WR1. His production helped elevate the Seahawks into serious playoff contention.\n\nMyles Garrett’s season will go down in history — he shattered the NFL single-season sack record with 23 and logged 33 tackles for loss. His relentless pass rush and ability to disrupt games earned him Defensive Player of the Year honors for a second time. Garrett’s dominance, even when facing constant double teams, illustrated his evolution into one of the truly elite defenders in the league. His impact extended beyond sacks, as he altered offensive game plans weekly.\n\nMcMillan made an immediate splash in his rookie season, leading all first-year players in receiving and showcasing a polished route tree and natural ball skills. His chemistry with his quarterback and knack for big plays gave the Panthers a reliable and explosive weapon. The award signals the start of a potentially incredible NFL career, with McMillan already displaying pro-caliber instincts. His performance brought excitement to Carolina’s offense and optimism for the future.\n\nSchwesinger arrived as a surprise standout, amassing impressive tackle totals and impact plays that anchored the Browns’ defense. His instincts in coverage and physicality in run support distinguished him from his draft class peers. Winning Defensive Rookie of the Year validated his immediate contribution and hinted at future stardom. His emergence added a dynamic element to Cleveland’s defense.\n\nThuney’s performance as an interior offensive lineman earned him the inaugural Protector of the Year award, emphasizing his role in stabilizing the Bears’ offensive front. His pass protection and run-blocking prowess helped elevate Chicago’s offensive efficiency. Known for his intelligence and technique, Thuney became a leader on the line. This award recognizes the importance of unsung linemen who anchor offensive success.\n\nMcCaffrey’s journey back from significant injury was one of the most impressive stories of the season, finishing with over 2,100 scrimmage yards and 17 touchdowns. His versatility — as a runner, receiver, and team leader — made him indispensable to the 49ers’ offense. The award honors not just statistical excellence but resilience and dedication to rehabilitation. His triumphant return energized teammates and fans alike.\n\nVrabel guided the Patriots through a successful turnaround, leading them to an AFC East title and deep playoff push on his first year with the team. His leadership and game management earned recognition as Coach of the Year by his peers. Vrabel’s emphasis on culture and discipline translated into tangible improvement on the field. The award underscores his impact in transforming the Patriots into a contender.\n\nMcDaniels’ role as Assistant Coach of the Year reflects his influence in shaping the Patriots’ offensive identity and maximizing the talent on the roster. Known for his strategic approach and game-planning acumen, McDaniels helped elevate New England’s execution. His contributions were integral to the team’s success and competitive positioning.\n\nWagner was honored for his exceptional leadership on the field and impactful community service off it. The Walter Payton Man of the Year Award recognizes players who demonstrate commitment to their communities, and Wagner’s efforts have extended well beyond football. His charitable initiatives and mentorship work set a standard for NFL players. The award celebrates character and civic contribution.\n\nTaken as a whole, the complete list of 2026 NFL Honors winners tells the story of a season driven by elite play, leadership, and perseverance. Each awardee left a distinct imprint on their team and, in many cases, the broader direction of the league. As the NFL turns the page to a new season, these honorees stand as benchmarks for excellence and reminders of how special the 2025 campaign truly was.\n\nThe post Complete list of winners in 2026 NFL Honors appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Vrabel – who was a three-time Super Bowl champion in eight seasons as a linebacker with the Patriots from 2001-08 – was asked how he will use that experience as a player to coach against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday.\n\n\"I think I always try to use every experience that I've had over the course of 30 years of experience in this league whether that's as a player as a coach to help the team and to help individual players do their job,\" Vrabel said at his Tuesday press conference.\n\n\"You only have so many opportunities to make a play,\" he said. “You have to be ready.\"\n\nVrabel took advantage of those chances as a player. Will he do the same as a coach?\n\nMORE: Revisting Mike Vrabel's time as a Patriots linebacker\n\nVrabel would become the fifth player to win the Super Bowl as a player and coach. A look at those other four individuals:\n\nFlores was a backup quarterback for the Chiefs when they won Super Bowl 4 against Minnesota.

    "description": "New court filing sheds considerable light on Gruden's four-year-old civil action.",
    "fullText": "Former Buccaneers and Raiders coach Jon Gruden's lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell continues. And, as Gruden sees it, the potential financial damages will be very significant.\n\nIn a Case Conference Report filed on Wednesday, February 5, Gruden's lawyers revealed that his losses \"total well over $150,000,000.\" The damages flow from, per the Case Conference Report, \"loss of his employment, interference with future employment opportunities, loss of contract value, loss of sponsorships, reputational damage, costs, expert fees, and attorney fees incurred as a result of this dispute.\"\n\nGruden filed the lawsuit roughly a month after his forced resignation from the Raiders, following reports from the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times containing emails Gruden had sent and received while employed by ESPN. Those emails had been harvested as part of an investigation regarding the Washington Commanders and former owner Daniel Snyder. Gruden contends that the emails were leaked with the specific goal of prompting the termination of his employment.\n\nThe Case Conference Report was prepared following an \"early case conference\" in which the NFL declined to participate. The league, we're told, contends that discovery in the case has been stayed pending the appeal of a denial of a motion to dismiss under the Nevada anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nIn the Case Conference Report, a copy of which PFT has obtained and reviewed, Gruden's lawyers list in the form of mandatory disclosures the potential witnesses in the case. They include: Goodell, various attorneys from the Paul Weiss law firm, former NFL general counsel Jeff Pash, chief NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, Snyder, former Raiders general counsel Dan Ventrelle, Raiders owner Mark Davis, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, attorney Beth Wilkinson, various attorneys from the Reed Smith firm, Desiree Perez of Roc Nation, former NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith, and Gruden.\n\nThe Case Conference Report does not expressly indicate that any, some, or all of these individuals listed will be deposed by Gruden's lawyers, and it does not mention any current attempts to compel their deposition testimony.\n\nThe Case Conference Report lists several specific NFL teams that have potentially relevant information: the Commanders, Raiders, Cowboys, Patriots, Seahawks, Giants, Jets, and Dolphins. It does not identify any of the reporters from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.\n\nIn a separate portion of the Case Conference Report, Gruden's lawyers list various documents that they contend the NFL should disclose \"immediately.\" The documents include all 650,000 documents generated during Wilkinson's investigation of the Commanders and a so-called \"'Blackmail Powerpoint' presented by Daniel Snyder and/or Reed Smith to the NFL Defendants, containing communications by Roger Goodell and Jeff Pash.\"\n\nThe Case Conference Report also states that no settlement discussions have occurred.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the NFL has filed, or plans to file, a petition for appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the question of whether Gruden should be required to pursue his claims through arbitration controlled by the NFL.\n\nThe case has been pending for more than four years, due mainly to the preliminary skirmishes regarding the arbitration question. At some point, depositions will occur and documents will be obtained — unless the case is dismissed or settled.",

    "fullText": "Comedian and actor Drew Desbordes, better known as Druski, had the privilege of joining Barry Sanders in co-presenting the NFL’s Offensive Player of the Year award, which went to Seattle Seahawks superstar Jaxon Smith-Njigba. There was the usual “wrong cue on the teleprompter” gag right before the nominees were announced, and then Druski announced JSN as the winner.\n\nThis isn’t like Cher thinking Luther Vandross won a Grammy from beyond the grave, this was Druski seemingly trying to mispronounce Smith-Njigba’s surname for comedic effect/hoping it goes viral.\n\nDruski mispronounced Jaxon Smith-Njigba's name on purpose, right?\n\nThis was worse than Mike Verbal pic.twitter.com/ZBBMDDHscP\n\n— Ben Brown 🌻 (@BenBrownPL) February 6, 2026\n\nFor those who don’t know Druski either from social media or the T-Mobile commercials, he is a big sports fan and actually aspired to be a sportscaster before turning to comedy. My suspicion is that he 100 percent knew how to pronounce Smith-Njigba’s name and could’ve just said “JSN” from the get-go if he wanted to.\n\nUchenna Nwosu and the Seahawks PR team took Druski to task on this one.\n\n— Uchenna Nwosu (@UchennaN_42) February 6, 2026\n\nHall of Famer Barry Sanders drew the short straw getting stuck with @druski’s big whiff tonight.

He’ll be looking to win the Super Bowl this Sunday against the New England Patriots, whose head coach is apparently new Coach of the Year winner Mike Verbal.

    "fullText": "In 2026, the Dallas Cowboys will be among the teams taking part in the NFL's international games.\n\nWith the thought that the Cowboys could head down under to Australia and even to Mexico after Jerry Jones made it clear he would be interested in such a move, Dallas now knows where it will be heading in 2026.\n\nIt will be the first time the Cowboys have played an international game since 2014, and coach Brian Schottenheimer's team is off to Rio de Janeiro in 2026.\n\nWe don't know who their opponents will be, but it will no doubt be a huge draw given the Cowboys are involved.\n\nAfter a failed 2025 season, the Cowboys will now look towards the 2026 season as one where they can mount a bounce-back and make the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.\n\nAnd playing in Brazil will certainly have its perks.\n\nMost of all, the marketing side, which we know Jerry and the Cowboys will eat up.\n\nSchottenheimer will lead his Cowboys to a place they've never played an NFL game before, nor the NFL, as Maracanã Stadium will host the game, with the previous outings in Brazil being played in São Paulo, so it will be another career first for the head coach.\n\nWhat is rather interesting about the Cowboys playing in Brazil is that, as we understand it, it will be a home game at AT&T Stadium, and so the franchise is giving up the revenue that goes with that.\n\nBut of course, there are riches to be mined internationally, too.\n\nReportedly, the Cowboys' potential opponents for the game are the Buccaneers, Titans, Jaguars, Niners, Cardinals, and Ravens.\n\nThat is, providing the NFL doesn't make it an NFC East showdown, which does seem highly unlikely, but you never know in the NFL.\n\nSo there will be a lot to monitor over the coming weeks and months, as the Cowboys go international for the first time in over a decade, with Schottenheimer's new-look Dallas team leading the way.\n\nThe Ravens loom as a good opponent for the Cowboys, as do the 49ers, but they are already heading to Australia to face the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nEither way, the Cowboys are going to be part of the international series, and that's exciting.",

    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL in the British amateur game with the London Warriors.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people.

Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018.

    "fullText": "As the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots prepare for a high-stakes Super Bowl rematch at Levi’s Stadium, anytime touchdown props remain the most electric way to get skin in the game.\n\nWhether you’re banking on Kenneth Walker III to exploit a gap in the New England front or expecting Drake Maye to call his own number on a red-zone scramble, the anytime TD market allows you to turn every trip inside the 20 into a potential celebration.\n\nJoin us as we delve into this popular Super Bowl props market with odds, Super Bowl picks, and insightful TD trends.\n\nBettors have been banking big on Kenneth Walker III, who leads all players with four postseason touchdowns. That includes a sizzling three TD performance against the 49ers in which he ran for 116 yards on 19 carries.\n\nThe bruising back should continue to carry the load for the Seahawks, who will be without Zach Charbonnet, who sustained a season-ending ACL injury against San Francisco.\n\nLooking for extra value? Drake Maye's anytime TD odds have been boosted to +350 by our friends at BET99. You won't find a better price on this market in Canada.\n\nRhamondre Stevenson hasn't scored in the postseason yet, but he finished the regular season with at least one TD in three straight games, crossing the goal line a collective six times in those outings. Expect the Pats' RB1 to scamper into the end zone again on Sunday.\n\nRashid Shaheed is a home run threat and faces a man-heavy scheme from the Patriots, which also him to utilize his speed and seperation. Seattle is also using the WR in the running game with tricky handoffs. He has options on how to get inside the end zone.\n\nRead more of Jason's Super Bowl LX predictions and picks before game time.\n\nMack Hollins has been in and out of the lineup with injuries, but he logged more snaps during the AFC Conference Championship than any other New England Patriots wide receiver, signaling clear trust when he’s healthy. It’s a steep price, but one that makes sense for a receiver who should be competing for the team lead in targets.\n\nNot only is Drake Maye the only Patriot to score a rushing touchdown this postseason, but he's already logged 141 rushing yards on 24 carries against three elite defenses, including two games with double-digit attempts. Don't be surprised to see him call his own number when it matters most.\n\nElijah Arroyo is Josh's longshot Super Bowl TD pick. Although not a primary option, the Seahawks tight end is expected to see around 40% of the snaps and run roughly 30% of the routes.\n\nRead Josh's Super Bowl touchdown prop picks for even more analysis.\n\nJosh expects Stevenson to get all the work to the red zone, but Maye will take the ball over the threshold as the Seahawks have allowed just five RB rushing TDs this year. Shaheed, meanwhile, has breakaway speed and can contribute on both special teams and on offense, while Hollins' price is too long to not add for a +8500 monster moonshot.\n\nRead more of Josh's insights in his Seahawks vs. Patriots Predictions, Picks & Best Bets.\n\nAn anytime touchdown bet involves wagering on whether a specific player will score a touchdown at any point during the game, not just the first TD.\n\nFor example, if you bet on Patriots running back Rhamondre Stevenson to score an anytime touchdown and he finds the end zone at any time during the Super Bowl, you win the bet.\n\nThis type of bet is popular because it allows for more scoring opportunities, and you can often choose players based on advantageous matchups. The odds can vary based on the player’s scoring potential and the strength of the team’s offensive scheme.\n\nHere are some of the key factors oddsmakers consider when setting touchdown prop odds:\n\nPlayer performance: Historical data on a player's scoring ability, including past touchdowns, carries, and target share, is crucial.\n\nMatchup analysis: The opposing defense's strengths and weaknesses are evaluated, including how well they defend against specific positions.\n\nInjury reports: Injuries to key players can impact a player's likelihood of scoring. Check out our NFL Injuries page to stay up to date before making your wager.\n\nGame script: Oddsmakers consider potential game scenarios, such as whether a team is expected to be ahead or behind and how that may impact their strategy.\n\nPublic sentiment: Betting patterns and public perception can also sway odds. If a player is very popular or a big favorite, sportsbooks may adjust their odds to mitigate risk. You can check out our Covers NFL picks consensus to see how the public is leaning.\n\nThe Super Bowl has evolved into a pass-heavy spectacle, as seen in Super Bowl 59, where five of the seven total touchdowns were caught by wide receivers.\n\nThe table below tracks every anytime touchdown over the last decade of Super Bowls from Super Bowl 50 to Super Bowl 59.\n\nWRs have scored 50% of all TDs in the last 3 Super Bowls.\n\nOften all or nothing. Saquon Barkley had 25 carries but 0 TDs in SB 59.\n\nTravis Kelce has been the standard, but SB 59 saw a TE shutout.\n\nJalen Hurts holds the record with 4 career SB rushing TDs.\n\nCooper DeJean’s pick-6 in 2025 was the first since Super Bowl 50.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL, playing in London's Finsbury Park in the British amateur game.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him.

    "fullText": "The Senior Bowl was last week, and the Arizona Cardinals now have a new head coach. We can now begin to firmly look ahead toward the NFL draft.\n\nNFL.com's Bucky Brooks released a new mock draft of the first round.\n\nThe Cardinals have the third overall pick, and he has them going with an offensive lineman.\n\nThe Cardinals must determine if Kyler Murray remains the franchise quarterback. If his time in the desert is indeed done, as many have speculated, the lack of QB depth in the 2026 draft class could prompt the team to look elsewhere for help at the game's most important position. In this case, Arizona adds a foundational piece to its struggling offensive line, which contributed to a 38.7% pressure allowed rate -- the fourth-highest mark in the league in 2025, per Next Gen Stats.\n\nThis pick makes sense. The Cardinals need to figure out the quarterback situation, but they won't likely be selecting one in the first round. They have questions at as many as four starting spots on the offensive line, so landing Fano to lock down right tackle would be a great plan to pair with Paris Johnson.\n\nHowever, while the pick makes sense, it would mean breaking from a three-year trend. The Cardinals have only selected players from the SEC and Big Ten in the first and second rounds in three years with Monti Ossenfort as general manager.\n\nKnowing that, someone like linebacker Arvell Reese out of Ohio State makes sense, but he goes second overall in these projections.\n\nOssenfort obviously could break from his tradition, but it will be something to watch as we approach the draft in the mweeks to come.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs has made an impact on WR Kayshon Boutte this season.\n\nBoutte was available at Day 2 of Super Bowl week on Tuesday. He, along with several other players, in addition to coaches, spoke to the media with Super Bowl LX just days away. Boutte was asked about his missed connections with quarterback Drake Maye in the postseason, as well as his struggles on and off the field that he divulged with The Players’ Tribune, among other questions.\n\nPer Blitz Sports Media’s Ryan Linkletter, Boutte gave Diggs his just due when asked about the latter’s impression on the wide receiver room in New England.\n\n“I would say personally for my development, I felt like it was always good to have a great receiver come in. I felt like it always pushed me to be great,” Boutte said. “So I think that’s one thing I told myself in the offseason. Whatever he do, I’m going to match it. Just to try to get myself to where I want to be.”\n\nDiggs was signed by the Patriots after recording six 1,000-yard receiving seasons in six of the seven years before he arrived in New England. The two-time All-Pro receiver opened the field up for Boutte with the attention he garnered from opposing defenses.\n\nBoutte caught a career-high 71.7 percent of his passes in 2025 — up 8.5 percent from 2024 — with additional career-highs in yards per target (12), as well as yards per reception (16.7). Diggs distinguishably improved the three-year veteran’s potential for yardage this season. His work in the locker room paid dividends behind the scenes.\n\nBoth wide receivers look to put a stamp on their dynamic as the featured pass-catchers on the outside for New England with a win at Super Bowl LX on February 8.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Kayshon Boutte: Stefon Diggs ‘pushed me to be great’ in 2025",

    "description": "Nakobe Dean's re-signing would be a no-brainer if a recent market value projection proves an accurate guess.",
    "fullText": "A crap shoot, an inexact science. For all of the time and energy that Philadelphia Eagles coaches and scouts put into player evaluations, that's how the NFL Draft is described. Simply put, regardless of how hard these guys work to dissect these NCAA prospects, there are no guarantees about what they will or won't become at the next level.\n\nTake Nakobe Dean, for example. He's one of the better recent examples of that. His final year with the Georgia Bulldogs was the stuff of legend. We saw him blitz and make plays in the open field. Heck, we saw him intercept a pass while covering a guy in the slot once.\n\nWhen his final season ended at UGA, he had won the Butkus Award and been named a Unanimous All-American. Oh, and by the way, he was part of a College Football Playoff National Championship-winning roster.\n\nThe NFL Draft came. Surely he'd be a first-round draftee. That's what we thought. He was invited to Las Vegas as one of the sure-fire first-round prospects. That's when adversity came. He slid to Round 3, and Philadelphia made him the 83rd-overall selection.\n\nThere were rumors of a concealed injury, the likely reason he wasn't taken as high as some thought he should have gone. His first year at football's highest level was spent largely with him playing on special teams.\n\nYear two ended with a trip to the Eagles' injured reserve. In year three, he took on an expanded role and played well, but he again landed on the IR. Year four was again a contract season. He again missed time due to injury. That brings questions as we are knee-deep into another offseason. The most obvious one is as follows.\n\nSpotrac shared his market value recently. They see a four-year deal worth $31,599,724 as being fair. That's an annual salary of $7,899,931. This deal would rank 326th among active players. Here are two questions.\n\nFirst, would Philadelphia be willing to keep him around for that price? Second, would that interfere with their ability to sign needed defensive talent later on? One has to hope that the answers to those questions are 'yes' and 'no'. A record-breaking salary cap figure is projected for the coming 2026 NFL season.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, the Eagles have an embarrassment of riches at the linebacker position. Zack Baun is as good a player as comes at the position. Philadelphia has Jeremiah Trotter Jr., Jihaad Campbell, and Smael Mondon all waiting in the wings.\n\nThat said, one could understand why Philadelphia would keep Dean around or let him walk. We'll see what happens, especially since they have to make other decisions about contributors, namely Dallas Goedert and Reed Blankenship.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Nakobe Dean's projected price tag could make re-signing a no-brainer",

Some fans have gone so far as to say they will boycott the performance, while others are perfectly fine with the global music star taking the stage.\n\nMORE: Bad Bunny’s new Super Bowl 2026 trailer sends clear message ahead of halftime show\n\nKevin Durant, however, falls into a different category altogether. The longtime NBA veteran recently spoke candidly about Bad Bunny and his music, offering a personal perspective as the Super Bowl LX halftime show approaches.\n\nDurant appeared on Kay Adams’ Up and Adams podcast on Wednesday, where he shared that he has not listened to any of Bad Bunny’s songs. When the former NFL Network reporter asked Durant, “I want to know how you’re doing?” he replied, “Doing better. We’ll see in the morning.” Later, when Adams said, “Well enough to like to dance to Bad Bunny, [Super Bowl] halftime?” Durant simply confessed, “I haven’t listened to Bad Bunny before.”\n\nKay Adams: \"I want to know how you're doing?\"\n\nKevin Durant: \"Doing better.

His albums, including ‘YHLQMDLG’, ‘El Último Tour del Mundo’, and ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, were huge hits. His ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’ especially made history because a Spanish-language album became one of the most popular in the United States and worldwide.\n\nBut some NFL fans are unhappy about Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl. He has been outspoken on social and political issues, especially about U.S. immigration policies and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).\n\nHe made a high-profile speech at the 2026 Grammys condemning ICE actions and calling for empathy toward immigrants, which upset many conservative viewers. These critics see him as too political and say his views don’t fit a traditionally neutral sports event.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Kevin Durant stuns NFL world with honest Bad Bunny confession ahead of Super Bowl halftime show appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Veteran punk rockers Green Day, who are also vocal critics of the president, are performing at the Super Bowl opening ceremony.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nTurning Point USA announced that MAGA country singer Kid Rock will headline its “All American Halftime Show,” scheduled to take place at the same time as the official halftime performance from Latin superstar Bad Bunny, who predominantly sings in Spanish.\n\nTrump also offered the dubious explanation that he was unwilling to travel to California because it was “just too far away,” despite regularly flying around the world and having attended last year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nHe told the New York Post that he would be welcomed by the crowd if he dared to go. “They like me,” he said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Davis Ingle insisted that Trump would receive a warm welcome if he attended Super Bowl LX in person.\n\n“President Trump is working hard on behalf of the American people,” Ingle told Zeteo. “If he did attend the Super Bowl, he would receive a warm welcome because America knows he has done more to help this country than any other president in history.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "On Sunday, one billionaire family will walk away from the Big Game a few dividends richer.\n\nWhile fans are focused on the matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots, the owners of both teams have their own stakes in the outcome, with billions in franchise value on the line.\n\nThe NFL is one of the biggest businesses in the world, accounting for 30 of Forbes' top 50 sporting franchises of 2025.\n\nAnd while star players and coaches are certainly deserving of credit for that fact, it's often the owners who are responsible for the key decisions made by their franchise.\n\nKansas City Chiefs co-owner and CEO Clark Hunt, for example, hired head coach Andy Reid in 2013; the Chiefs have since appeared in five Super Bowls, winning three.\n\nOwners aren't only judged by their fanbases, though; they're judged by the players, too. Last year, the NFL Players Association released its third annual club report cards, based on a survey completed by 1,695 active players.\n\nOne of the categories players were surveyed about was ownership, which was graded based on how willing players believe an owner is to invest in the team's facilities, how much they contribute to a positive team culture, and how committed they are to building a competitive team. Each owner was given a letter grade ranging from an F- (0-49) to an A+ (97-100), which are included below.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the NFL's team owners, from how they acquired their team, to their NFLPA grade, to how the team's performed during their tenure.\n\nAll owner net worths were accurate as of February 3, 2026.\n\nMichael Bidwill is a third-generation owner of the Arizona Cardinals, inheriting the team after his father, Bill Bidwill, died in 2019. Forbes estimated in 2015 that the family's net worth was $1.4 billion.\n\nThe Cardinals were originally purchased by Michael Bidwill's grandfather, Charles, in 1933 for $50,000 — now, they're worth $5.5 billion, ranking as the 45th most valuable sports team in the world, per Forbes.\n\nUnder Michael Bidwill's leadership, the team has made just one wild-card playoff appearance, which they lost in 2021, and he was given a D- by the NFL Players' Association; the report said players feel that he \"only slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a November 2023 investigation by ESPN detailed a number of workplace misconduct allegations from current and former Cardinals employees. Bidwill told the outlet in a statement that the team has \"worked hard over the last several years to improve our culture across the board,\" adding, \"We have more to do and, as I have said to every member of the Cardinals organization, that includes my own work to grow and improve as a leader.\"\n\nThe Cardinals did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHome Depot cofounder Arthur Blank, who Forbes estimates is worth $11.1 billion, purchased the Atlanta Falcons in 2002 for $545 million, famously writing the agreement on a cloth napkin during a December 2001 meeting with seller Taylor Smith. The sale was finalized just a couple of months later in February 2002.\n\nUnder Blank's leadership, the Falcons have had nine winning seasons, including eight playoff berths and a Super Bowl LI appearance in 2017. Blank also built Mercedes-Benz Stadium and was named the 2021 Sports Philanthropist of the Year by ESPN. He was given an A+ ranking by the NFLPA.\n\nPer Forbes, the Falcons are the 29th-most-valuable sports team in the world, worth $6.35 billion.\n\nAt 65, Allegis Group founder Steve Bisciotti, who Forbes estimates has a net worth of $8.5 billion, is one of the youngest owners in the NFL. He bought a minority stake from the previous owner, Art Modell, in 2000 and completed his purchase in April 2004, spending a total of $600 million, ESPN reported at the time.\n\n\"We're proud of what we're giving to Baltimore. You have to make the playoffs to have the opportunity to compete for championships, and championships are our goal. We want to be a consistent winner that avoids big lulls and not being in the playoffs for any length of time,\" Bisciotti has said.\n\nThe Ravens have won two Super Bowls under Bisciotti (2000 and 2012) and are consistently competitive, posting one of the strongest postseason records in the NFL under Bisciotti's ownership.\n\nForbes valued the team at $6.1 billion, ranking it 33rd most valuable in the world. Bisciotti received an A rating from the NFLPA.\n\nIn October 2014, energy billionaire Terry Pegula, now estimated to have a net worth of $9.3 billion, purchased the Buffalo Bills with his wife, Kim Pegula, for $1.4 billion in cash, outbidding the likes of Donald Trump and Jon Bon Jovi.\n\nIn December 2024, Terry Pegula and the Bills added 10 limited partners to the team's ownership group, described as \"non-controlling, minority interests.\" Some of these partners include former US National Team soccer player Jozy Altidore and former NBA players Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady.\n\nThe diversification of ownership came after Kim Pegula was declared legally incapacitated in March 2023 following a brain injury sustained during cardiac arrest in June 2022. Kim Pegula is still listed as a co-owner by the Bills organization, but her duties as president have been assumed by Terry Pegula, who maintains the titles of co-owner, CEO, and president.\n\nDuring the Pegulas' tenure, the Bills have become a formidable team, with eight playoff appearances, including the 2020 AFC Championship. The Pegulas also own the Buffalo Sabres in the NHL.\n\nForbes reported that the Bills are worth $5.95 billion, ranking them 37th among the world's most valuable sports teams. Pegula was given a B in ownership by the NFLPA.\n\nTerry and Kim Pegula are the parents of WTA No. 6 player Jessica Pegula.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist David Tepper purchased the Carolina Panthers in 2018 for $2.275 billion, ESPN reported. Tepper has an estimated net worth of $23.7 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n\"I am thrilled to begin this new era of Carolina Panthers football and am humbled by the overwhelming excitement and support for the team,\" Tepper said at the time.\n\nUnder his ownership, the Panthers endured several losing seasons and missed the playoffs through 2024. In the 2025 season, Carolina finished 8-9, won the NFC South, and made its first playoff appearance since 2017.\n\nThe team is valued at $5.7 billion, making it the 40th-most-valuable team in the world, tied with the NBA's Miami Heat, according to Forbes.\n\nTepper was given a D- in ownership by the NFLPA; in the report card, players expressed frustration over the stadium's use of synthetic turf rather than natural grass. Players also said Tepper \"only slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and is \"only somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nThe Panthers did not respond to Business Insider's previous request for comment.\n\nIn February 2025, the Chicago Bears announced the team's longtime principal owner, Virginia Halas McCaskey, had died at age 102.\n\nHer son, George McCaskey, has served as the team's chairman since 2011, following the death of his brother, Michael McCaskey, and continues to serve in that role.\n\nHalas McCaskey had been the oldest and longest-tenured team owner in the NFL, having inherited the team in 1983 after her father, Hall of Famer and Bears founder George Halas Sr., died.\n\nUnder her ownership, Halas McCaskey saw the Bears reach four NFC Championship Games and two Super Bowls, including a win in 1986. The team has struggled in recent years, finishing the 2024 season 5-12, but they had a stronger season this year, finishing with an 11-6 record and winning their first playoff game in 15 years.\n\nThe McCaskey family was awarded an A- in ownership by the NFLPA.\n\nIn 2015, Forbes estimated the McCaskey family had a net worth of $1.3 billion, and the team, which is worth $8.2 billion today, was reported to be the 10th most valuable sports team in the world in a tie with the MLB's New York Yankees.\n\nMike Brown inherited the Cincinnati Bengals in 1991 after the death of his father, Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown.\n\nPaul Brown founded the Bengals in 1967 after cofounding and coaching the Cleveland Browns (who, yes, bear his name) for more than a decade.\n\nIn 2011, the Brown family purchased the remaining 30% of the team they didn't own for $200 million in cash, becoming the sole owners of the Bengals, the NFL reported, citing Forbes. Mike Brown and his family have an estimated net worth of $5 billion.\n\nMike Brown is the Bengals' principal owner and team president. After decades of struggle, the Bengals found success in recent years thanks in part to quarterback Joe Burrow and wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, who led the team to Super Bowl LVI in 2021, losing 23-20 to the LA Rams.\n\nMike Brown received a C ownership rating from the NFLPA.\n\nFormer Pilot Company CEO Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Dee Haslam, purchased a 70% stake in the Cleveland Browns from Randy Lerner in 2012 for $1 billion. Jimmy Haslam has an estimated net worth of $8.7 billion, per Forbes.\n\nSince the Haslams took over, the Browns have had just two winning seasons, in 2020 and 2023.\n\nThey were given a C+ ownership rating by the NFLPA and, per Forbes, the team is worth $6.4 billion, making it the 28th most valuable franchise in the world.\n\nJerry Jones is the man behind the most valuable sports franchise in the world — the Dallas Cowboys — worth $13 billion, per Forbes.\n\nThat's more than 90 times what Jones paid for the team in 1989. (He paid H.R. Bright $140 million.) He and his family now have an estimated net worth of $20.8 billion, per Forbes.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the Cowboys won three Super Bowls (1992, 1993, and 1995), but they haven't made it beyond the divisional round of the playoffs since.\n\nJones was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017 — the 15th owner to receive such an award — and was given a B in ownership by the NFLPA in 2025.\n\nIn August 2022, the Walton-Penner Family Ownership Group purchased the Denver Broncos from the Pat Bowlen Trust for $4.65 billion, the NFL reported.\n\nThe controlling ownership designation was transferred from Rob Walton — heir to the Walmart fortune — to his son-in-law, Broncos CEO Greg Penner (who's married to Carrie Walton Penner), in October 2023. Rob Walton and his family have an estimated net worth of $142.5 billion, per Forbes.\n\nPenner oversaw the hiring of Broncos head coach Sean Payton, who, alongside rookie quarterback Bo Nix, took the team to its first playoff game since its Super-Bowl-winning 2016 season.\n\nThe Broncos are tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 18th-most-valuable sports team in the world, with a reported value of $6.8 billion.\n\nThe Walton-Penner family was given an A ownership ranking by the NFLPA.\n\nSheila Ford Hamp became the principal owner and chair of the Detroit Lions in June 2020, after inheriting the team from her mother, Martha Firestone Ford.\n\nFirestone Ford had previously taken over the team in 2014 after the death of her husband, Bill Ford Sr., who'd purchased the Lions in 1963 for $6 million. In 2015, Forbes estimated the Ford family had a net worth of $2 billion.\n\nUnder Sheila Ford Hamp's leadership, the Lions have entered an unprecedented era of success, thanks in large part to her hires, GM Brad Holmes and head coach Dan Campbell.\n\nThe Lions, valued at $5.4 billion, ranked 48th among the world's most valuable sports franchises in 2025.\n\nSheila Ford Hamp received a B+ in ownership from the NFLPA in February 2025.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are the only publicly owned team in the NFL.\n\nFans have owned the franchise for more than a century, and there have only been six stock offerings, the most recent being in 2021, with stocks worth $300. Per the Packers, the franchise is owned by more than 539,000 people who own more than 5.2 million shares.\n\nThe Packers are the 23rd most valuable sports team in the world, worth $6.65 billion, according to Forbes, and they were given an A- in ownership by the NFLPA.\n\nAnd if you're wondering how the team is actually run: It's governed by an unpaid board of directors and a seven-member executive committee.\n\nIn 1999, the Houston Texans were founded by Janice and Bob McNair. When Bob McNair died in 2018, ownership was transferred to Janice. Then, in March 2024, it was transferred to their son, Cal McNair, via a vote. Per Forbes, Janice McNair and the family have an estimated net worth of $7.3 billion.\n\nCal McNair had already been serving as the team's chair and CEO since July 2018 and January 2019, respectively.\n\nThe Texans finished the 2025 regular season 12-5 and defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-6 in the wild-card round of the playoffs before losing to the New England Patriots in the divisional round.\n\nForbes reported that the Texans are the 17th most valuable sports franchise in the world, worth $7.4 billion. Cal McNair was given an A ownership rating by the NFLPA in 2025.\n\nSince June 2025, the Indianapolis Colts have been owned by Jim Irsay's daughters — Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, and Kalen Jackson — following the longtime owner's passing in May 2025.\n\nCarlie Irsay-Gordon is the team's principal owner and CEO. Like her father, Irsay-Gordon worked her way through multiple areas of the Colts organization, like marketing, community relations, and football operations, before becoming CEO.\n\nTheir grandfather, Robert Irsay, originally purchased the team — then known as the Baltimore Colts — in 1972 for $12 million. He moved the team to Indianapolis in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, his son, Jim Irsay inherited the team at just 37 years old. He served as the team's principal owner, chairman, and CEO during his life, and had an estimated net worth of $4.8 billion at his time of death.\n\nUnder Jim Irsay's leadership, the Colts won 10 division titles and made two Super Bowl appearances, including a win in 2007.\n\nThe Colts are the 38th most valuable sports franchise in the world, in a tie with the Houston Rockets, worth $5.9 billion, and Irsay was given a B in ownership by the NFLPA in 2025.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have been owned by the Hunt family since the beginning. Lamar Hunt Sr. founded the team in 1959 as the Dallas Texans, and the team was moved to Kansas City in 1963. After Lamar Hunt Sr.'s death in 2006, ownership was divided between his wife, Norma, and their four children: Clark Hunt, Sharron Hunt Munson, Daniel Hunt, and Lamar Hunt Jr. As of 2024, the family has an estimated net worth of $24.8 billion, per Forbes.\n\nClark Hunt (pictured above with his wife and children) became the team's CEO in 2010 and has since been responsible for team decisions, including the hiring of head coach Andy Reid in 2013.\n\nReid has since become the winningest head coach in franchise history with three Super Bowl victories alongside quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nForbes ranked the Chiefs, worth $6.2 billion, as the 32nd most valuable franchise in sports.\n\nClark Hunt's ownership rating rose from an F- in 2024 to a C- in 2025; in the report card, players said they feel he \"moderately contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nMark Davis, who has an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion, inherited the Las Vegas Raiders (then the Oakland Raiders) in 2011 after the death of his father, Al Davis.\n\nAl Davis originally purchased a 10% stake in the team in 1966 for $18,500 and increased his ownership to 67% before his death.\n\nIn October 2024, Mark Davis expanded the team's ownership, selling 5% to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, 5% to Knighthead Capital Management cofounder Tom Wagner, and 0.5% to former NFL defensive lineman Richard Seymour.\n\nThe following month, Davis agreed to sell an additional 15% of the franchise, with equal stakes going to Silver Lake co-CEO and Endeavor board chairman Egon Durban and Discovery Land Company founder and chairman Michael Meldman.\n\nDespite the changes, Davis remains the team's principal owner and was given an A rating by the NFLPA in February 2025. The Raiders are reportedly worth $7.7 billion, making them the 13th-most-valuable sports team in the world.\n\nIn 2018, Dean Spanos became the principal owner of the Los Angeles Chargers (previously the San Diego Chargers) after the death of his father, Alex Spanos.\n\nThe elder Spanos had owned the team since 1984, after purchasing a 60% stake for $70 million, ESPN reported. He went on to buy out minority owners' shares to own 97% of the team, which was passed on to his four children. In 2018, the Spanos family had an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion.\n\nDean Spanos took over daily operations as team president in 1994, and has passed along day-to-day duties to his sons, AG and John Spanos, who now work as president of business operations and president of football operations, respectively.\n\nIn October 2024, billionaire Tom Gores purchased a 27% stake in the team for $750 million.\n\nThe Chargers are tied with the Chicago Bulls and Mercedes (F1) as the 34th most valuable sports franchise in the world, worth $6 billion.\n\nSpanos' NFLPA ownership ranking improved from a C+ in 2024 to an A in 2025. In the latest report card, Spanos was given a 9.6/10 rating for his \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities\"; players also said he \"significantly contributes to a positive team culture\" and is \"extremely committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nIn August 2010, Stan Kroenke paid $750 million to become the principal owner of the St. Louis Rams. He had previously been a minority owner of the team, purchasing a 30% stake in 1995 and increasing it to 40% stake by 1997.\n\nIn 2016, fellow NFL owners approved Kroenke's proposal to move the Rams back to Los Angeles, and in 2021, he opened SoFi Stadium, home to both the Rams and the Chargers.\n\nThe LA Rams are worth $10.5 billion, according to Forbes, making them the third most valuable team in sports, behind the Dallas Cowboys and the Golden State Warriors, while Kroenke himself has an estimated net worth of $21.3 billion.\n\n\"Stan has the vision, resources, inspiration and creativity to create the right setting for the NFL in Los Angeles,\" Jerry Jones has said, calling him \"a valuable asset to the National Football League.\"\n\nSince 2010, the Rams have made seven playoff appearances, all under head coach Sean McVay. The Rams won the Super Bowl in 2022 at home at SoFi, becoming just the second team to win the Super Bowl at home.\n\nKroenke was given a C ownership rating by the NFLPA.\n\nHe also owns Premier League team Arsenal FC.\n\nIn January 2009, billionaire Stephen M. Ross completed his purchase of the Miami Dolphins for a total of $1 billion. Ross had initially purchased a 50% stake in the franchise in February 2008 for $550 million, and the following January, he purchased an additional 45 percent of the team, leaving 5% to previous owner Wayne Huizenga, ESPN reported.\n\nAfter his 2009 purchase, Ross said, \"That is the most important thing, and the thing that drives me — creating and being part of a winning organization. There is nothing more important than that.\"\n\nToday, Ross is the chairman of the board, managing general partner, and owner of the team, which is worth a reported $7.5 billion, making it the 15th most valuable franchise in sports in a tie with the Los Angeles Clippers. Ross has an estimated net worth of $17 billion.\n\nThe Dolphins were the highest-ranked team in the league by the NFLPA, earning an A or A+ in all categories, including treatment of families, the locker room, weight room, training staff, head coach, and ownership. Ross himself earned an A+ ranking, one of only three owners to receive such high praise.\n\nIn June 2005, Red McCombs sold the Minnesota Vikings to brothers Zygi and Mark Wilf, their cousin Lenny Wilf, and their co-investors for $600 million. Zygi Wilf is widely reported to have an estimated net worth of $1.3 billion, although it hasn't been reported by Forbes.\n\nToday, Zygi Wilf is the chairman and control owner of the team, though the trio's individual stakes have never been divulged, Sport Business Journal reported.\n\nThe Vikings ranked as the second-best team in the NFL, according to the NFLPA's 2025 report cards, earning A+ marks in ownership, head coach, locker room, and treatment of families.\n\nUnder the Wilfs' ownership, the team opened US Bank Stadium in 2016 — the largest construction project in Minnesota's history — and has made multiple playoff appearances, though the Vikings haven't reached the Super Bowl since 1976.\n\nThe Vikings are the 31st most valuable team in sports, worth $6.25 billion, per Forbes.\n\nRobert Kraft is one of the best-known owners in the league. He purchased the New England Patriots in 1994 for $172 million and now has an estimated net worth of $13.8 billion.\n\nThrough the purchase, Kraft became the team's chairman and CEO, and he pledged \"to help bring a championship to New England.\"\n\nMore than 30 years later, the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history with six Super Bowl victories from 10 appearances. This year, they're going for a record seventh win.\n\nPer Forbes, the Patriots are worth $9 billion — more than 52 times what Kraft bought the team for.\n\nHe received a D ownership ranking from the NFLPA. On the report card, Kraft was rated 6.15/10 for his \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities,\" and players said he \"slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\" Kraft announced that a new, $50 million training facility is expected to open this year.\n\nThe Patriots did not previously respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn 2018, Gayle Benson inherited the New Orleans Saints from her husband, Tom Benson, after his death. She has an estimated net worth of $7.9 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nTom Benson had previously purchased the team in 1985 for about $70 million.\n\nIn 2021, Gayle Benson told The Times-Picayune that after her death, the succession plan is to sell the Saints and the NBA's New Orleans Pelicans (which she also owns) to a buyer who promises to keep the teams in New Orleans and donate all the proceeds to charities.\n\n\"When Tom bought this team, he didn't have a lot of money. Everything that he had, had to be given to keep the team. He worked really hard to get the Pelicans here. He sacrificed a lot. I want to make sure that we keep the teams here. I want them to stay in New Orleans forever,\" Benson said.\n\nBenson was given an A ranking in ownership by the NFLPA. The Saints, worth $5.3 billion, did not make Forbes' list of 50 most valuable sports teams in 2025, but it ranks 31st most valuable out of all 32 NFL teams.\n\nThe New York Giants were founded in 1925 by Tim Mara and have been part of the Mara family ever since.\n\nTeam ownership was passed to Tim's sons, Jack and Wellington Mara, in 1959, and now the team is run by principal owner, CEO, and president John Mara, who took over in 2005 after his father, Wellington's, death. John Mara had been with the organization since 1991.\n\nHowever, while John Mara is listed as the team's principal owner, he's actually shared ownership with Steve Tisch since 2005.\n\nSteve Tisch's father, Preston Robert Tisch, purchased a 50% stake in the Giants in 1991, and after his death, Steve became chairman and executive vice president.\n\nTogether, Mara and Tisch helped plan and build MetLife Stadium, and the team has won two Super Bowls (2008 and 2012) under their leadership. However, the team has struggled in recent years, winning just four games last season.\n\nStill, the Giants are the fourth most valuable team in sports, worth $10.1 billion. Tisch has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion, Forbes reported, while Mara reportedly has an estimated net worth of $500 million.\n\nTisch was not named in the 2025 report card; Mara was given a C+ ownership ranking by the NFLPA.\n\nWoody Johnson — of Johnson & Johnson lineage — purchased the New York Jets in 2000 for $635 million. Forbes estimated in 2024 that the Johnson family had a net worth of $16 billion.\n\nThe Jets have struggled under his leadership, having failed to make the playoffs for the past 15 seasons. Johnson was also accused of letting his teenage sons, Brick and Jack, make decisions for the organization, as reported by The Athletic and ESPN's Rich Cimini in 2024.\n\nJohnson denied those claims in a January 2025 interview with the New York Post, telling the outlet they were \"unsubstantiated\" and that his son Brick \"has no role in the organization.\" Johnson added, \"When you're losing games, it gives people the artistic license to kind of do what they want.\"\n\nWhen reached by Business Insider for a comment in January 2025, a representative for the Jets shared the earlier comments made to the New York Post.\n\nThe Jets finished the 2025 season 3-14 and will be looking to greatly improve under new head coach Aaron Glenn and new GM Darren Mougey, and without quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was released by the team in February 2025.\n\nJohnson's ownership ranking declined from a B- in 2024 to an F in 2025. In the report card, players said they feel he \"does not contribute to a positive team culture\" and is \"somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\" The Jets declined to comment on the rating when reached by Business Insider.\n\nStill, the team is considered the 12th most valuable franchise in sports, worth $8.1 billion, per Forbes.\n\nBusinessman Jeffrey Lurie purchased the Philadelphia Eagles in 1994 for $185 million. He now serves as the team's chairman and CEO, and he and his family have an estimated net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Eagles have made the playoffs numerous times and won two of their four Super Bowl appearances.\n\nLurie received a B ranking from the NFLPA, and the team is worth $8.3 billion, per Forbes, making it the ninth-most-valuable franchise in sports.\n\nSimilar to the Mara family and the Giants, the Pittsburgh Steelers have been part of the Rooney family since 1933, when the team was founded by Art Rooney. He remained the team's chairman until his death in 1988.\n\nAfter his death, his son Dan Rooney took over ownership until his death in 2017.\n\nNow, Dan's son, Art Rooney II, is responsible for most of the franchise's stake. However, he's been an active member of the organization since 1989, when he was first on the team's board of directors. He was named president of the Steelers in 2003.\n\nSince 2017, the Steelers have made six playoff appearances, though they've failed to get past the divisional round. Despite recent difficulties, the Steelers remain one of the most successful franchises in NFL history, with six Super Bowl wins from eight appearances.\n\nThe Steelers are the 26th most valuable team in sports in a tie with Ferrari (F1), worth $6.5 billion. In 2015, Forbes reported that the Rooney family had an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion.\n\nArt Rooney II received a D in the NFLPA's ownership ranking. He was given a 6/10 for his \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities,\" and players feel he \"slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and is \"committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nThe Steelers did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn 1977, Edward DeBartolo Sr. paid $13 million for the San Francisco 49ers to give to his son, Edward DeBartolo Jr.\n\nEdward DeBartolo Jr. ran the 49ers organization throughout the '80s and '90s, leading to five Super Bowl wins and securing his position in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. But in 1998, DeBartolo pleaded guilty \"to not reporting a bribe from a Louisiana government official,\" Forbes reported, so his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, took over ownership in 2001. DeBartolo Jr. was pardoned by Donald Trump in February 2020.\n\nDeBartolo York and her husband, John York, have been cochairs of the team since then, while their son, Jed York, has been CEO since 2010.\n\nIn March 2024, ESPN reported that Jed York was moving to become the team's principal owner. \"I think it's just a move from a family standpoint to just keep this team in our family for generations to come,\" he said, per ESPN.\n\nThough the team hasn't won a Super Bowl since 1994, it has remained competitive. In the last six seasons, the 49ers have made four NFC Championship and two Super Bowl appearances.\n\nThe 49ers are the eighth most valuable franchise in sports, worth $8.6 billion, and the DeBartolo-York family received an A- in ownership from the NFLPA. They have an estimated net worth of $8.4 billion.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are owned by the Paul G. Allen Estate.\n\nPaul G. Allen was the cofounder of Microsoft alongside Bill Gates. He purchased the Seahawks in 1997 for $194 million.\n\nAt the time of his death in 2018, he had an estimated net worth of $20.3 billion. His estate has since been controlled by his sister, Jody Allen. In July 2024, Sports Illustrated reported she is the team's principal owner and that there's a \"mandate that she eventually sells the team and donates the proceeds to charitable causes\" that Paul Allen supported.\n\nOther members of the Seahawks' senior leadership include president Chuck Arnold and GM John Schneider.\n\nThe Seahawks have been steady since 2018, making multiple playoff appearances and, in the 2025 season, advancing to the Super Bowl, their first NFC Championship and Super Bowl berth since 2014.\n\nThe team is valued at $6.7 billion by Forbes, making it tied with the Boston Celtics for 21st most valuable sports franchise. Jody Allen was given a C+ in ownership.\n\nOwnership of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is split between the six siblings of the Glazer family: Avram Glazer, Bryan Glazer, Darcie Glazer Kassewitz, Edward Glazer, Joel Glazer, and Kevin Glazer.\n\nThe team was purchased by their father, Malcolm Glazer, in 1995 for $192 million, and they inherited it after his death in 2014. As of 2024, the Glazer family has an estimated net worth of $10.2 billion.\n\nThe NFLPA's team report card gave the family a D+ in ownership, a slight improvement from 2024's D- ranking. Players feel the family \"slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\" The report also gave the family a 6.5/10 rating for \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers did not respond to a previous request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe Buccaneers have won two Super Bowls (2003 and 2021) under the Glazer family and are worth $6.6 billion, according to Forbes, making the team the 24th highest valued franchise in the world in a tie with Manchester United, which is also owned by the Glazer family.\n\nAmy Adams Strunk, who has an estimated net worth of $2.8 billion, is the controlling owner and cochair of the Tennessee Titans, having inherited the team in March 2015 after the death of her father, KS \"Bud\" Adams, in 2013. (Adams founded the team as the Houston Oilers in 1960.)\n\nSince 2015, the Titans have had six winning seasons, including five playoff berths.\n\nAs an owner, Adams Strunk has worked to increase the team's staff by more than 150% and has been a key figure in getting approval for a new stadium, the Titans reported. She was awarded a B in ownership by the NFLPA, and the team is ranked as the 30th-most-valuable sports franchise, worth $6.3 billion, per Forbes.\n\nIn 2023, investor Josh Harris purchased the Washington Commanders from Dan Snyder for a record $6.05 billion. He made the purchase through the Harris Ownership Group, which includes limited partners like former NBA star Magic Johnson, investor David Blitzer, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.\n\n\"I feel an awesome responsibility to the city of Washington,\" Harris said after the sale, per ESPN. \"I know what I've got to do. It comes down to winning. It's on me and on our ownership group to deliver. That's what we're going to do.\"\n\nHarris has an estimated net worth of $10.7 billion, per Forbes.\n\nHarris was given an A in ownership by the NFLPA after his second season with the team. The Commanders are the 14th most valuable franchise in sports, worth $7.6 billion, per Forbes.\n\nIn the 2024 season, the Commanders made their first NFC Championship since 1992 under the leadership of head coach Dan Quinn and rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels.",

    "description": "Senior figures in sport maintained personal contact with Jeffrey Epstein, while others were discussed regarding potential deals.",
    "fullText": "Senior executives in Formula 1, football and American football maintained their links with Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction for a sex offence, documents included in the latest Epstein files release show.\n\nMillions of new files relating to the notorious American financier were released last Friday.\n\nThey included emails and text messages between Epstein and some public figures who - before the files were released - claimed they had distanced themselves from him following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nThe files also include documents that show discussions about potential business deals involving Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, and high-level sports executives.\n\nBeing named in the documents does not in itself indicate any wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to emails between Epstein and Jean Todt - the former president of motorsport governing body the FIA and team boss of Ferrari during the early 2000s - Todt visited Epstein at the latter's New York home in 2017.\n\nIn May of that year, Epstein emailed Todt to say \"jean, sorry it was so short and Terje did not give me any notice in advance to help with the fun\".\n\n'Terje' appears to be Norwegian diplomat Terje Rod-Larsen, who the files show was also in contact with Epstein, and sent a text message to the American saying: \"Think it could be useful for you to meet Jean Todt. Sent you his contact info. Call him and invite him for coffee.\"\n\nReplying to Epstein, Todt wrote: \"It was nice to get to know you through our common friend Terje. Let me know if you come to Paris or Geneva. I will be back in New York in mid-July.\"\n\nThe following day, Epstein sent an email to Eduardo Teodorani - now chairman and vice-president of the Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the UK - saying: \"i had jean todt to my house ? odd guy.\"\n\nTeodorani replied: \"Very. But why?\" No further replies are visible in the documents.\n\nTodt's name was first mentioned to Epstein in 2013, when another contact - French diplomat Olivier Colom - emailed him to say: \"Going out at Jean Todt tonight. Do you know him? I introduced Terje to him lately. Good man.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted Todt, who is now the United Nations' special envoy for road safety, for comment.\n\nFlavio Briatore - now executive adviser and de-facto team principal of the Alpine F1 team - also maintained contact with Epstein, according to the files.\n\nOne email from 2010, sent by a person whose identity is redacted, said: \"Flavio Briatore would like to speak with you. He can be reached at his office in London.\"\n\nLater the same year, Epstein referred to Briatore as \"my Italian friend\" in an email chain discussing the potential purchase of an aircraft by Mohamed Al Fayed - the late businessman who has been accused of multiple alleged rapes and attempted rapes.\n\nBriatore was also mentioned in a conversation between Epstein and Lord Mandelson - the former business secretary and US ambassador, who is facing an investigation into alleged misconduct in public office. The subject was a property in Chelsea, which Epstein was told Briatore wanted to sell.\n\nBBC Sport has approached Briatore's representative for comment.\n\nThe files show Crystal Palace investor Josh Harris remained in contact with Epstein via email and phone calls for many years after his conviction, including joining him for a breakfast meeting in 2013 after which he sent an email saying \"thank you for inviting me\".\n\nHarris - whose private equity firm Apollo Global Management also owns NBA team the Philadelphia 76ers, NHL team New Jersey Devils, and the NFL team Washington Commanders - also contacted Epstein in 2016, saying he was \"happy to catch up\" at some point in the future.\n\nA spokesperson for Harris said: \"Josh Harris never had an independent relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Harris sought to prevent Epstein's attempts to develop a corporate relationship with Apollo. As these emails indicate, Harris sought to avoid meeting with Epstein, cancelling meetings and having others return his calls.\"\n\nEmails sent to Epstein also appear to show he conducted two meetings with Todd Boehly - now co-owner and chairman of Chelsea - in 2011, three years after Epstein's conviction.\n\nThe emails suggest Epstein wanted to be introduced to Boehly, who at the time was co-owner of baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers, and a managing partner at global asset management firm Guggenheim Partners.\n\nNeither Boehly nor Chelsea have made a public comment.\n\nCeltic owner Dermot Desmond was mentioned twice in emails sent to Epstein in 2010 on behalf of golf resort developer Gerald G Barton.\n\nIn the messages, Epstein was told by somebody writing on behalf of Barton that Irish billionaire Desmond - a golf resort owner - was willing to provide millions of dollars to help co-fund golf developments.\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Celtic for a response from Desmond.\n\nNew York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch repeatedly sent complimentary emails to Epstein in the early 2010s, and Epstein appeared to be attempting to arrange meetings between Tisch and women.\n\nIn one, in 2013, he told Tisch, \"I can bring the Russian if you like\".\n\nIn a statement, Tisch said: \"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments.\n\n\"I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.\"\n\nThe NFL says it is deliberating whether to conduct a formal investigation into Tisch.\n\n\"We are going to look at all the facts,\" said commissioner Roger Goodell when asked at a news conference about Tisch's conduct.\n\n\"We're going to look at the context of those [messages]. We're going to try to understand that and we'll look at how that falls under the policy,\" Goodell said.\n\nIn 2016, the billionaire property developer Andrew Farkas apologised on behalf of himself and Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross for the condition of the mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, that Epstein visited, and a year later Farkas told Epstein that Ross would be willing to provide up to $100m of funding for a project also part-funded by Epstein.\n\nBBC Sport has approached the Miami Dolphins for comment.\n\nThe files also include contact between sports figures and Ghislaine Maxwell - serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her role in Epstein's crimes - that took place before her former partner's conviction.\n\nCasey Wasserman - chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games and founder of marketing agency Wasserman - exchanged sexually charged emails with Maxwell in 2003.\n\nWasserman told her \"I miss you\", asked \"can I book that massage now?\" and requested to see Maxwell in \"a tight leather outfit\".\n\nWasserman's agency represents some of the most high-profile athletes in the world.\n\n\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said.\n\n\"I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"\n\nDavid Wassong, who - according to an online profile - advises entrepreneurs and businesses, sent a message to Maxwell in 2003 asking \"are you going to send me names and numbers of people to play with in Ireland?\"\n\nMaxwell replied with the phone number of former F1 driver Eddie Irvine. She also introduced Irvine to other acquaintances in the same year, according to emails.\n\nIrvine has previously admitted attending parties organised by Epstein and Maxwell in New York and Miami, and says he saw Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's accuser Virginia Giuffre at one event, but presumed she was about 20.\n\n\"I knew Ghislaine reasonably well,\" Irvine said in 2020. \"I spoke to her from time to time and I spoke to [Epstein] from time to time. Ghislaine was always super-sweet and a super-nice lady.\n\n\"When I was around, it was just a normal dinner, just parties. There'd just be a party where some people would turn up and some people wouldn't. But about that other stuff, I have no idea.\"",

    "fullText": "Eyewitness News has learned the murder of former NFL player Kevin Johnson may be connected to three separate murders of homeless people living in encampments along the L.A. River near Willowbrook, sometimes called Compton Creek.\n\nAll four homicides occurred in the same general location in the 1300 block of East 120th Street between October 2025 and January 2026. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department noted that all four victims were unhoused individuals who were living in encampments in the area.\n\nJohnson's body was found at a homeless encampment next to Compton Creek on Jan. 21. His cause of death was listed as \"blunt head trauma\" and \"stab wounds,\" and the manner of death was ruled a homicide, according to L.A. County Medical Examiner records.\n\nORIGINAL REPORT: Former NFL player Kevin Johnson stabbed to death at LA homeless encampment\n\nFormer NFL player Kevin Johnson was found dead at a homeless encampment in the Los Angeles area. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.\n\nAccording to sources close to the investigation, the string of murders in the Compton Creek area began on Oct. 5, 2025, when a woman, identified as 52-year-old Michelle Steele, was shot in the head. She died in the hospital on Nov. 12, 2025.\n\nThree weeks later, on Dec. 4, a homeless man identified as 52-year-old Octavio Arias was murdered in the same area. According to L.A. County Medical Examiner records, Arias died from head and neck trauma.\n\nThe fourth victim, following the murder of Kevin Johnson, was identified as Mauro Alfaro, also in his 50s. According to sources, Alfaro was killed on Jan. 26, and the cause of death was blunt force trauma.\n\nThe L.A. County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau says investigators are now looking into the possibility that all four murders were done by the same killer. A suspect has not been identified.\n\nDetectives are still trying to determine motives in the killings and trying to figure out if the suspect is someone who is upset with homeless people being in that area, or if drugs or gangs may be involved. Sources say there is no concrete evidence linking the cases together.\n\nEight detectives are working the case, and say they are having a hard time getting information from the homeless population in the area. County workers have been conducting outreach in the area, trying to get the homeless population to move out into other housing.\n\nAnyone with information should call homicide detectives at 323-890-5500 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS(8477).\n\nJohnson, a native of L.A., played for the Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders from 1995 to 1997.\n\nAfter his career in the NFL ended, he played in the Arena Football League with the Orlando Predators and L.A. Avengers.",

    "description": "One NFL analyst provided a piece of offseason advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "NFL.com analyst Kevin Patra has a piece of advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason: re-sign or replace linebacker Devin Lloyd.\n\n\"The Jags seem unlikely to use the franchise tag on Lloyd (projected at $28.2 million, per Over The Cap),\" wrote Patra. \"If he prices himself out of Jacksonville, there will be a gaping hole in the middle of Campanile’s D that needs to be filled.\"\n\nLloyd did a bit of everything for the Jaguars' defense this past season and brought a high-impact presence. When he missed time briefly with an injury during the middle portion of the season, his absence was noticeable.\n\nLloyd finished the season totaling 25 pressures as a blitzer during the regular season, and ranked 11th among linebackers in PFF's run defense grade. In coverage, he recorded five interceptions and two pass breakups.\n\nAs Patra pointed out, the franchise tag won't be an option at that amount. As a free agent, Lloyd is going to garner interest from a number of teams. Spotrac is projecting that he earns a three-year deal worth $60.4 million.\n\nFor a Jaguars team that's a bit short on cap space currently and has other needs to address -- like the defensive line and cornerback -- does Jacksonville have the flexibility to bring Lloyd back at that amount?\n\nIf Lloyd doesn't return, there will certainly be a void to fill in the middle of the Jaguars' defense and no obvious fill-in next to Foye Oluokun.\n\nCurrent on the roster options to potentially take over for Lloyd include Ventrell Miller, Jack Kiser, Yasir Abdullah, and Jalen McLeod.\n\nAddressing this position early on in the draft could be a real possibility for Jacksonville. Anthony Campanile's defensive scheme and his coaching background at the linebacker position may have to be tasked with elevating this unit as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: What Jacksonville Jaguars must accomplish during 2026 NFL offseason",

    "description": "Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks lands with the Chargers in ESPN's latest NFL mock draft after a strong Senior Bowl showing.",
    "fullText": "Former Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks is projected to be selected by the Los Angeles Chargers with the No. 22 pick, according to ESPN's latest 2026 NFL mock draft.\n\nAccording to analyst Matt Miller, his reasoning is pretty straightforward: the Chargers need more of a true anchor on the defensive line, and Banks fits the mold as a nose tackle who can hold ground against the run while still bringing some juice as a power rusher.\n\nBanks is listed at 6-feet-6-inches and 339 pounds, and Miller describes him as an \"aggressive bull rusher\" with rare first-step quickness for a guy built like that.\n\nBanks' most recent season with the Gators didn't look normal on paper because he was limited to two games due to a foot injury. That's the type of thing that can quietly stall a prospect's momentum, especially when draft cycles move as fast as they do. But that's also where the Senior Bowl comes in.\n\nHis week in Mobile, Alabama, was well-received by scouts, and it sounds like the practices helped reintroduce him as a disruptor instead of \"the injured guy who missed time.\"\n\nBanks still has plenty of runway left in the pre-draft process, and his medicals and testing will matter a ton. But getting slotted in the first round, even in a mock, is the kind of headline that sticks. It puts Banks firmly in the \"name to know\" tier as draft talk heats up.\n\n\"The run on edge rushers before this pick leaves the Chargers with some interesting decisions. Do they add to an offensive line that was marred by injury in 2025 or try to fix a D-line that still needs a true anchor to help defend the run?\n\n\"With the talent that's left on the board, Banks would be very enticing as the nose tackle Los Angeles is missing. The 6-foot-6, 339-pounder is an aggressive bull rusher with rare first-step quickness for his size. Think Vita Vea, but with better length. Banks missed all but two games last season due to a foot injury, but his Senior Bowl performance was well-received by scouts, who saw the explosive play in the trenches that excited them entering the 2025 season.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

    "description": "Former LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane is expected to be selected early in the 2026 NFL Draft. Here are three ideal fits for the former Tiger.",
    "fullText": "Former LSU football cornerback Mansoor Delane made his mark during his lone season at LSU, earning first-team All-American honors and finishing as a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, which is given to the nation’s top defensive back.\n\nHis impressive 2025 campaign has firmly put him in the conversation for an early first-round pick in the NFL Draft in April. Where he might come off the board is up for debate, with some mock drafts having him go in the early to mid-teens, while one recent mock draft had him taken in the top five.\n\nThe goal of this piece is to take a look at some teams that fit the former Tiger best, but his notoriety limits the options to some extent. It’s highly unlikely Delane makes it past the middle of the first round, so we’re going to limit the available options to teams who are projected to be within range to select him.\n\nThis isn’t only a great fit because Delane would be joining two former Tigers in Cincinnati, though that certainly heightens the intrigue for LSU fans. The Bengals had one of the NFL’s worst passing defenses in 2025, ranking in the bottom quartile of the league in passing EPA/Play, passing success rate allowed, and explosive pass percentage allowed, according to ESPN’s Sam Hoppen.\n\nGiving them a corner with Delane’s talent has proven to be a major factor in turning around defenses in the past, and there are few in the league who need that sort of talent injection more than Cincinnati.\n\nThe Rams were one of the NFL’s best teams this season, and a draft-day trade with the Falcons last offseason landed them what has become the 13th overall pick. Although their defense certainly wasn’t a terrible unit by league standards, their passing defense certainly wasn’t a strength, allowing 7.6 yards per pass attempt this season.\n\nMany mock drafts have the Rams selecting Tennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy over Delane, but Delane feels like the more likely — and smart — pick. This Rams team wants to maximize its Super Bowl window while Matthew Stafford is still playing, and McCoy didn’t play a snap in 2025 due to an injury during the 2024 college football playoff. Despite concerns about Delane’s size and athleticism, he offers the Rams elite coverage play that they don’t have to draft based on year-old tape.\n\nThe Jets are a distinctly different situation from the Rams. This isn’t a team trying to max out a Super Bowl window; it’s a team that’s trying to reload a defensive roster that’s devoid of talent. The draft strategy that works best for a team like this is taking the best player available, and if Delane is still on the board at 16, he certainly qualifies.\n\nAdditionally, Delane would be a great fit for Aaron Glenn’s man-coverage-heavy defense. According to Pro Football Focus, Delane posted the second-best man-coverage grade among Power Four cornerbacks in 2025, meshing perfectly with a Jets defense that ran man coverage fourth-most in the league this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Three likely draft destinations for LSU football corner Mansoor Delane",

    "fullText": "Following an electric 2025 season that saw him hoist both the national championship and the Heisman trophy as an Indiana Hoosier, Fernando Mendoza now finds himself as the runaway favorite to be the first overall pick of the 2026 NFL Draft. That means that professional scouts and coaching staff alike will now be assessing not just his athleticism, but his attention to detail, pattern recognition, general recall, and the overall state of his mental capacities.\n\nThere’s a lot that goes into studying and understanding an NFL playbook, but according to one of Mendoza’s former classmates, the Las Vegas Raiders are going to love what they see in Mendoza when they finally get to interview him and quiz him.\n\nA former UC Berkeley student, claiming to have shared a contracts law class with the future first-overall draft pick during his time at the university, suggested that the professor of their class was notorious for giving student athletes, specifically football players, a hard time. “If you are a football player at Cal, there is, unfortunately, a stereotype,” she noted.\n\n“The professor would ask a law question and then ask one of the football players like, ‘Why is this, this?’ or ‘Why is this that?’ Fernando always knew his shit. Like, he would shut up the professor because he would be so impressed that he knew what was going on, and mind you, this is a law class at Berkeley.”\n\nSuffice to say, Mendoza’s competitiveness extends well beyond the football field, and he wasn’t going to be shown up by some uppity law professor from the West Coast. Although the fan did also suggest that the instructor’s confrontations with student athletes were never hostile and predominantly friendly.\n\n“The professor would always tease football players and most of the football players would tease him back, and it would just be some kind of banter.” she recalled. Nevertheless, that kind of attention to detail and willingness to understand the finer points of any subject is exactly what head coaches and coordinators will be looking for in Mendoza’s upcoming interviews.\n\nThrow in the fact that the 22-year-old has one of the most positive attitudes of any prospect in recent memory, and it’s safe to say that this will be a slam dunk for the Raiders on night one of this year’s draft. “Even though he was being teased by the professor, he would just be smiling. He would answer whenever he was asked. He was such a genuine, humble guy.”\n\nMuch has been made of Mendoza’s squeaky clean image, but as more personal testimonies, like this one, begin to come to the forefront, it becomes readily apparent that he is in fact as nice as everyone says he is, and that will certainly go long way in securing him a lengthy career in the National Football League.\n\nThe post “Fernando Mendoza Used to Regularly Stump His Own Law Professor”: Berkeley Law Student Puts Insane Allegations Against Heisman Winner appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "The NFL is returning to Mexico in 2026. The last time there was a regular-season game in Mexico was in 2022 when the Arizona Cardinals \"hosted\" the San Francisco 49ers. Since then, Estadio Azteca was undergoing major renovations.\n\nHowever, games return. The league announced on Monday that there will be regular-season games in Mexico City in the newly named Estadio Banorte (previously Estadio Azteca) for the next three seasons. The game in 2026 will be in December.\n\nAs the Cardinals have played twice in Mexico, and NFC teams have nine home games in 2026, it will be something to watch. They perhaps will end up either as the designated home team, as they have been in both previous trips there, or the road team.\n\nThe announcement gives the league nine international games in 2026.\n\nOne game in Melbourne, Australia, and the LA Rams will be one of the teams\n\nOne game in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nOne game in Mexico City, Mexico\n\nOne game in Paris, France, with the New Orleans Saints as one of the participating teams\n\nThe Cardinals could viably play in Melbourne or Paris, as they will face the Rams and Saints in 2026, both on the road.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "NFL mock draft season is upon us, and for the first time in several years, the New England Patriots will be picking late in the draft.\n\nIn his latest two-round 2026 NFL mock draft, ESPN’s Matt Miller has the Patriots selecting edge defender Cashius Howell with the 31st overall pick and Indiana wide receiver Elijah Sarratt in the second round with the 63rd overall pick.\n\nBoth would bring instant playmaking ability to the team. Howell was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year after leading the conference with 11.5 sacks. He also recorded 31 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, six pass deflections and one forced fumble.\n\nThe standout defensive star was a unanimous All-American who could develop into a top pass-rushing option for the Patriots.\n\nAs for Sarratt, he would give Patriots quarterback Drake Maye another big-bodied playmaker to target downfield. He finished his collegiate run with 65 catches for 830 yards and 15 touchdowns. He earned Second-Team All-Big Ten honors and served a key role in Indiana's national championship run.\n\nIt's easy to forget that the Patriots are still a rebuilding team after their magical Super Bowl run this season. But there are notable areas for them to significantly improve their roster in the offseason.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: ESPN two-round 2026 mock draft has Patriots picking two impact players",
