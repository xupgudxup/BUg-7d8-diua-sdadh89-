    "fullText": "Game update (Sunday evening): With Buffalo’s loss to the Eagles, the Patriots have clinched the AFC East.\n\nGame update: New England’s blowout win over the New York Jets moves the Patriots one step closer to clinching the AFC East. If the Bills lose or tie against the Eagles later today, the Patriots will clinch the AFC East title.\n\nIf Buffalo wins that game, New England can clinch the AFC East with a win over the Dolphins next week.\n\nNew England’s win also prevents the Broncos from clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The Patriots can still catch Denver in that race. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nThe New England Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the AFC East in Week 15, when they blew a 21-0 lead and lost to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nBut the upstart Patriots can finish the job in Week 17, albeit with a little bit of help.\n\nHere is how the Patriots can clinch the AFC East for the first time since the 2019 season, Tom Brady’s last campaign in New England.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nHere are the full AFC standings entering Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC East standings entering Week 17:\n\nHere are the current AFC East standings:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x",

    "fullText": "It turns out the New Orleans Saints can win and have their cake and eat it, too. Sunday's win over the Tennessee Titans improved the Saints' record to 6-10 on the year, but it didn't drop the Saints any further down in the 2026 NFL draft order. They're still projected to pick at eighth overall by the experts at Tankathon.\n\nNow, we shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves. There are still a couple of prime-time games left to play and Monday night's matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams could shake things up if the Falcons lose and join the Saints at 6-10. Still, we have a good idea at where many teams will be picking, even if the draft order won't really begin to lock into place until after next week's games.\n\nStill, we're talking about going from eighth to potentially ninth. That would happen if the Falcons lose and their strength of schedule is calculated to be lower than New Orleans'. Right now, the Saints own that tiebreaker at .492 against Atlanta's .498. Margins don't get much slimmer than that.\n\nBut don't expect any help from the Rams. They're still competing for playoff seeding and they happen to own Atlanta's first round draft pick, so they're doubly motivated to beat up on the dirty birds. Of course there's a scenario where the Falcons lose and the Saints remain at No. 8. We just won't know until the dust settles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Saints' big Week 17 win didn't hurt their chances",

    "fullText": "NFL standings: Updated AFC, NFC playoff pictures for Week 17 of 2025 season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhat 14 teams are positioned to make the NFL playoffs in the 2025 regular season, from the eight division winners to six total wild cards?\n\nWhat would the seeding look like in the race for Super Bowl LX?\n\nHere are the answers in Sporting News' latest look at how the postseason field is coming together in both conferences going into the late Sunday and Monday games of Week 17:\n\nNFL Week 17 picks against the spread\n\n1. Denver Broncos, 13-3 (champions, AFC West)\n\nThe Broncos clinched the division title after holding off the Chiefs on Christmas night and then watching the second-place Chargers lose to the Texans on Saturday. They will need to beat the Chargers or see the Patriots lose to the Dolphins to earn the top seed in Week 18.\n\n2. New England Patriots, 13-3 (champions, AFC East)\n\nThe Patriots clinched the division title with their win over the Jets coupled by the Bills losing the Eagles. They can still earn the top seed over the Broncos with a win over the Dolphins and a Broncos loss to the Chargers in Week 18.\n\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars, 12-4 (first place, AFC South)\n\nThe Jaguars, who have clinched at least an AFC wild-card berth, still lead the division by a game over the Texans after their win over the Colts. The Jaguars will win the division with a win over the Titans or a Texans loss to the Colts in Week 18.\n\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers, 9-7 (first place, AFC North)\n\nThe Steelers, who got shocked by the Browns on Sunday, ssaw their division lead over the Ravens shrink after one game after the Ravens beat the Packers on Saturday night. The Steelers will now host a de facto division championship game vs. the Ravens in Week 18.\n\n5. Houston Texans, 11-5 (second place, AFC South)\n\nThe Texans, who have clinched at least a wild-card berth, kept the pressure on the Jaguars in the division after beating the Chargers on the road on Saturday. The Texans have the top wild-card spot thanks to a head-to-head sweep of the Bills and Chargers. The Texans need the Jaguars to lose to the Titans in Week 18 and also beat the Colts to win a third consecutive division title.\n\n6. Los Angeles Chargers, 11-5 (second place, AFC West)\n\nThe Chargers have clinched a playoff berth and will settle for being a strong wild-card team again. They lose the head-to-head tiebreaker vs. the Texans from Week 17 but hold the common-games tiebreaker over the Bills going into Week 18.\n\n7. Buffalo Bills, 11-5 (second place, AFC East)\n\nThe Bills have clinched a playoff berth but saw their five-year division reign end with their home loss to the Eagles in Week 17 coupled with the Patriots' rout of the Jets. The Bills are playing for only wild-card position now and could rest players vs. the Jets.\n\nNFL WEEK 17 PICKS: Against the spread | Straight-up predictions\n\nThe Ravens kept their division title hopes alive by winning a tough interconference matchup at the Packers on Saturday night and then watching the Steelers lose on Sunday, setting up that winner-take-all rematch in Pittsburgh.\n\nMORE: Giants, Raiders overtake Titans in race for No. 1 pick in draft\n\n8. Indianapolis Colts (8-8)\n10. Miami Dolphins (7-9)\n11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-10)\n12. Kansas City Chiefs (6-10)\n13. Cleveland Browns (4-12)\n14. New York Jets (3-13)\n15. Tennessee Titans (3-13)\n16. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)\n\nThe Colts were eliminated from playoff contention before facing the Jaguars, once the Texans beat the Chargers. The Chiefs continued their freefall, suffering their fifth consecutive defeat—now without Patrick Mahomes—against the Broncos on Christmas night. The Raiders got closer to locking down the top overall drat pick in 2026.\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks, 13-3 (first place, NFC West)\n\nThe Seahawks lead the 49ers and Rams by 1.5 games in the division after their big win over the Panthers in Carolina on Sunday. They will clinch the division title with a losses or ties by both the 49ers on Sunday night and the Rams on Monday night. The Seahawks can take the No. 1 seed with a 49ers tie with the Bears and a Rams loss or tie vs. the Falcons.\n\n2. Chicago Bears, 11-4 (champions, NFC North)\n\nThe Bears clinched the division title on Saturday night before their tough road game against the 49ers on Sunday night, thanks to the Packers losing to the Ravens, which put Green Bay too far behind going into Week 18. The Bears can now focus on beating the 49ers to keep pace with the winning Seahawks in the race for the top seed.\n\n3. Philadelphia Eagles, 11-5 (champions, NFC East)\n\nThe Eagles clinched the division title in Week 16 and stayed in play for the No. 2 seed by winning a tough interconference matchup over the Bills in Buffalo. The Eagles need the Bears to have a lesser record to move up because of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n\n4. Carolina Panthers 8-8 (first place, NFC South)\n\nThe Panthers still lead the Buccaneers by a game after their home loss to the Seahawks because of the Buccaneers' road loss at the Dolphins. The division comes down to the rematch in a de facto NFC South championship game with Carolina going to Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n5. San Francisco 49ers, 11-4 (second place, NFC West)\n\nThe 49ers would be the division champions plus No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs if they beat the visiting current No. 2 Bears on Sunday night and finish a sweep of the visiting Seahawks in Week 18.\n\n6. Los Angeles Rams, 11-4 (third place, NFC West)\n\nThe Rams have clinched at least a wild-card spot but now the division title is out of their control in relation to the Seahawks and 49ers. They're looking at best finishing in second place in the West.\n\n7. Green Bay Packers, 9-6-1 (second place, NFC North)\n\nThe Packers, who clinched a wild-card berth with the Lions losing to the Vikings on Christmas, can no longer win the division title over the Bears after losing at home to the Ravens on Saturday night. They should rest their several injured key players, led by Jordan Love, in Week 18 after locking into this last playoff seed.\n\nMORE: Derrick Henry bulldozes Packers to keep Ravens' playoff hopes alive\n\nThe Buccaneers stayed alive despite their loss Sunday at the Dolphins because the Panthers also lost to the Seahawks, The division title comes down to a one-and-done in Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n8. Minnesota Vikings (8-8)\n9. Detroit Lions (8-8)\n10. Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1)\n12. Atlanta Falcons (6-9)\n13. New Orleans Saints (6-10)\n14. Washington Commanders (4-12)\n15. Arizona Cardinals (3-13)\n16. New York Giants (3-13)\n\nThe Lions were the most recent team to be eliminated with their loss to the Vikings on Christmas day, which also came with them falling into last place in the division.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2025 regular season is coming to a close. Week 17 is here, with teams only having two games left to try to make a bid for postseason contention.\n\nEntering the week, 10 of the 14 total playoff spots up for grabs across the AFC and NFC were clinched. That list grew larger on Christmas, with the Packers landing a spot in the postseason after the Lions were eliminated following their shock defeat to the Vikings. The Houston Texans also beat the Los Angeles Chargers which clinched a playoff berth for the Texans and eliminated the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe top four seeds in each conference go to the division winners, regardless of their record compared to non-division winners. The overall No. 1 seed in both the AFC and NFC will earn a first-round bye in the playoffs and will not play until the Divisional round. That team will also hold home-field advantage until the Super Bowl, assuming it does not lose before then.\n\nDivision winners will also host a wild-card game, which can provide a significant advantage over a road team forced to travel. While it may feel like only one or two major games remain, there is enough variability in the seeding that nearly every game in Week 17 played a role in a team’s clinching scenario.\n\nHere is more on the teams that have clinched a playoff berth inWeek 17.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff standings going into Week 17\n\nHeading into Week 17, 10 of the 14 playoff spots across both conferences had been clinched, and each conference was in the exact same scenario. The Houston Texans were the second team to clinch during Week 17, punching their ticket with a win over the Chargers on Saturday.\n\nThe Packers booked their trip to the playoffs despite a Week 17 defeat at the hands of Baltimore, benefiting from Detroit’s Christmas Day loss to Minnesota.\n\nBoth the Carolina Panthers and the Pittsburgh Steelers had the chance to clinch in Week 17, but both teams lost and will be playing for the division in Week 18.\n\nThere are also other playoff implications in play, with some teams able to clinch their division and lock in a top-four seed.\n\nBelow is a look at the NFL's projected playoff bracket as it stands in Week 17.\n\n1. Denver Broncos (BYE)\n2. New England Patriots vs. 7. Buffalo Bills\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. 6. Los Angeles Chargers\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers vs. 5. Houston Texans\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks (BYE)\n2.

If the Bills lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles later today, the Patriots will wrap up the division title.\n\nIf the Bills win that game, the Patriots will have to wait until Week 18 to clinch the division. New England would just need a win over the Miami Dolphins to clinch their first division title since 2019.\n\nNew England’s win also denied the Broncos a chance at wrapping up the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nTwo AFC East rivals meet on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\n\nOne team has already clinched a playoff spot, but the other would love to play spoiler.\n\nHere is what is at stake Sunday when the New York Jets host the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Buffalo Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. The Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the division back in Week 15 when they blew a 24-7 halftime lead to the Bills, but still remain in the driver’s seat in the division title race. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early.

A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nWith the Jets already eliminated from the playoffs, this game has no tiebreaker implications between the two teams.\n\nHowever, it could play a role in the chase for the AFC East title. Right now the Patriots have a one-game lead over the Bills, and with the two teams having split the season series, the second tiebreaker is division record. New England has a 3-1 record in AFC East games (with the Jets and Miami Dolphins remaining) while the Bills are 3-2, with the Jets on the schedule in Week 18. A New England loss to the Jets opens the door to the Patriots and Bills finishing with the same division record, which would then move the AFC East title to the third tiebreaker, which is record in common games. Right now the Patriots are 9-1 in those games while the Bills are 9-2, but a loss to the Jets would drop New England to 9-2.\n\nWhich would potentially mean the AFC East title would be decided by the fourth tiebreaker, AFC record.

Remove them from your Week 17 lineups once confirmed.\n\nWe'll obviously exclude those who already were ruled OUT or INACTIVE for Thursday and Saturday games.\n\nTo check every player practice report and health designation every week, bookmark our NFL injuries tracker.\n\nWR DK Metcalf, Steelers - SUSPENDED\n\nRB Bhayshul Tuten, Jaguars - INACTIVE\n\nWR Kayshon Boutte, Patriots - OUT\n\nWR Calvin Austin III, Steelers - OUT\n\nK Jason Sanders, Dolphins - OUT\n\nThese fantasy names are expected to play in Week 17, but confirm their status before locking them into your lineups.\n\nStay tuned as questionable, injured players are confirmed to be ready to play in fantasy Week 17 around 11:30 a.m. ET for 1 p.m. kickoffs, 2:30-3 p.m. for late-window Sunday games, and from 6:30-7 p.m. ET for Sunday Night Football.\n\nWR Marvin Harrison Jr., Cardinals\n\nTE Dalton Kincaid, Bills (late window)\n\nTE Dawson Knox, Bills (late window)\n\nThe biggest injury watch for fantasy players heading into championship matchups unfortunately will last until Sunday Night Football, when Kittle's 49ers host the Bears.\n\nKittle (ankle) will test his low-to-mid ankle sprain pregame, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, but a source tells ESPN's Adam Schefter that No. 85 isn't expected to play.\n\nIf you're waiting on confirmed Kittle news when SNF inactives go live, consider these TE pivots:\n\nTE Jake Tonges, 49ers -- his direct replacement: Luke Farrell has mostly been used in complementary work and could vulture a touchdown, but Tonges has scored at least 11.8 PPR PPG in three of Kittle's five games missed this season.\n\nLucky enough to put Kittle in the flex position behind another tight end? Put these names on your watch list for an easy last-minute add from the waiver wire:\n\nWR Kendrick Bourne, 49ers (especially if Ricky Pearsall's knee and ankle injuries also keep him sidelined)\n\nRead more about George Kittle Week 17 fantasy replacements.\n\nThe Bears wideouts now leave fantasy managers in a predicament if they have no backups; they'll likely have to wait until tonight to get clearer word on their status.\n\nPick up Luther Burden immediately. If he's not available, try for the 49ers' Kendrick Bourne or the Falcons' David Sills V, who are widely available.\n\nEagles at Bills, heavy rain: Bills receivers are risky weekly plays anyway, so Josh Allen and James Cook remain must-starts. Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley should be valued as normal, while A.J. Brown (WR2) and DeVonta Smith (WR2/Flex) remain playable with small dings. TE Dallas Goedert should see plenty of midrange targets in the inclement weather.\n\nSteelers at Browns, periods of rain: Pittsburgh will continue relying on its ground game of Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell, especially with DK Metcalf suspended. Cleveland's offense looks primed to focus on TE Harold Fannin and RB Dylan Sampson, if they're both active, with a side of RB Raheim Sanders.\n\n👀 More updates on major Week 17 fantasy news:\n\nTaysom Hill Week 17 fantasy outlook\n\nGreatest fantasy games: Did Derrick Henry make the list after Week 17?\n\nThis week's fantasy football rankings were updated Sunday at noon ET.\n\nWe've based these fantasy football rankings on full-point PPR scoring except where otherwise noted.\n\nNEW - FANTASY TOOLS: NFL Player Stats | NFL Transactions | NFL Depth Chart",

While Buffalo has clinched a playoff berth, it are still fighting for the AFC East crown and the right to host a home playoff game.\n\nThis highly anticipated showdown between two championship-caliber teams is packed with contrasting narratives.

    "fullText": "The demolition of Hawai’i’s Aloha Stadium is finally underway after several delays.\n\nOnce home to the NFL Pro Bowl, college football’s Hawaiʻi Bowl and University of Hawaiʻi football, Aloha Stadium is transitioning into a new scaled-down stadium with an accompanying entertainment district.\n\nAs part of the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project, the new stadium is set for a projected grand opening in March 2029, and is expected to have a seating capacity of 22,500, less than half of the previous 50,000 seats it held.\n\n“The demolition/dismantling of Aloha Stadium has begun,” Aloha Stadium Authority chairman Eric Fujimoto said at the NASED monthly meeting on Dec. 18. The removal of furnishings and the subsequent dismantling of the facility are expected to take approximately 10 months.\n\nThe beginning of the demolition process marks a major milestone for a plan that has been repeatedly delayed. The reopening of the stadium was initially scheduled to be on time for the Rainbow Warriors’ football season in 2028, but was pushed back to 2029 in August of this year.\n\nBefore its final closing after years of maintenance issues, Aloha Stadium was an innovative steel-constructed venue with movable seating sections for different sports and events.\n\nHowever, the stadium, also known as the Metal Mecca, met its downfall because of that very design structure.\n\nThe steel structure was not a good match for Hawai’i’s humid climate, which led to severe, damaging rust that required frequent repairs.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the stadium with a costly history was put to rest.\n\nWith the demolition now in full swing, attention turns to the broader vision of the NASED project. The construction of the new, smaller stadium and the surrounding entertainment district is expected to cost the state $350 million.\n\nThe new Aloha Stadium’s entertainment district is expected to include 4,000 to 4,500 housing units, multiple hotels, retail and dining spaces and cultural attractions. Residential construction is projected to take place shortly after the opening of the newly renovated Aloha Stadium, as early as 2029 or 2030.\n\nDiego Rivera - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe University of Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors celebrate linebacker Jalen Smith's (3) fumble recovery during an NCAA football game against the Utah State Aggies, Saturday, October 11, 2025.\n\nAfter playing its home games at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex since the closing of Aloha Stadium, University of Hawai’i football is set to move back into the new facility in 2029 under a license agreement negotiated with Hawai’i Athletics Director Matt Elliott.\n\n“While there is still much work ahead, the progress being made gives all of us reason to be optimistic,” Elliott said in a September press release. “We are excited to see momentum building and remain committed to doing our part to bring this long-awaited vision to life.”\n\nAs demolition progresses and construction plans take shape, the NASED project ushers in a new era for Hawai’i sports.",

    "fullText": "Game result: The Texans beat the Chargers 20-16 on Saturday to clinch a playoff berth. They remain behind the Jaguars in the AFC South, but they cannot be eliminated from division contention if the Jaguars win on Sunday. The Chargers have already clinched a playoff berth, but the loss officially eliminates them from AFC West contention. They drop to the No. 7 seed and with Houston holding the tiebreaker over them, it’s unlikely they get much higher in the seeding.\n\nHouston jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter and looked like they might cruise to victory. They never fell behind, but LA fought back and cut the lead to one possession late in the fourth quarter. Special teams miscues once again cost them in the loss. They cut the lead to 20-16 and then missed a field goal. They made a key illegal contact penalty on a third down sack and couldn’t get the ball back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have already clinched a playoff spot.\n\nThe Houston Texans can join them this weekend, starting when the two teams meet Saturday at SoFi Stadium.\n\nHere is where both the Chargers and the Texans stand in the AFC playoff race.\n\nFor the Texans, 2025 has been a tale of two seasons. Houston began the year with three straight losses and went 3-5 over the first half of the season, but a seven-game winning streak has the Texans on the cusp of a playoff berth.\n\nHouston will clinch a playoff spot with a win or a tie in that game against the Chargers.\n\nHowever, even if the Texans lose to the Chargers, they can still clinch a playoff spot on Sunday. Houston is in the playoffs if the Indianapolis Colts lose or tie against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. And speaking of the Jaguars, Houston remains alive in the race for the AFC South title. With wins in their final two games and one loss from the Jaguars down the stretch, the Texans are AFC South champions.\n\nAs for the Chargers, they locked up a playoff spot when the Indianapolis Colts lost to the San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nBut Los Angeles remains alive in the AFC West race. The Denver Broncos moved one step closer to claiming the division title on Christmas night with a win over the Kansas City Chiefs. But with a win over the Texans, the Chargers can wrap up the division title in Week 18, as they take on the Broncos in the final game of the season. A loss or a tie against Houston would eliminate the Chargers from the AFC West race.\n\nHere are the current AFC standings following Denver’s win on Thursday night:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nThis game could have an impact on seeding between the two teams, under the NFL’s tiebreaker formula. As you can see above, right now the Chargers are the No. 5 seed with an 11-4 record, but the Texans are 10-5, down in the No. 7 spot.\n\nIf Houston wins, the two teams would have matching 11-5 records. The Texans’ win would give them a tiebreaker advantage over the Chargers should they finish tied at the end of the season. However, if Houston, Los Angeles, and Buffalo all finish tied at the end of the year, then their respective conference records will be the determining factor. Entering Week 17, the Chargers have an 8-2 record in AFC games, as do the Texans, while Buffalo is 8-3.",

Here's how the NFL playoff picture looks heading into Saturday night in Week 17:\n\n1. Broncos (13-3) Clinched the AFC West, cosing in on the No. 1 seed in the AFC.\n\n2. Patriots (12-3) Would lose the common-games tiebreaker to the Broncos.\n\n3. Jaguars (11-4) The clear favorites in the AFC South.\n\n4. Steelers (9-6) In the driver's seat in the AFC North.\n\n5. Bills (11-4) Probably won't catch the Patriots in the AFC East, but they've clinched a playoff berth.\n\n6. Texans (11-5) Clinched a playoff berth.\n\n7. Chargers (11-5) Clinched a wild card, will likely rest starters in Week 18.\n\n8. Colts (8-7) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n9. Ravens (7-8) Their chances of catching the Steelers in the AFC North are slipping away.\n\n10. Dolphins (6-9) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n11. Chiefs (6-10) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n12.

Raiders (2-13) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n1. Seahawks (12-3) Beating the Rams gave them a leg up on the race for the No. 1 seed.\n\n2. Bears (11-4) If the Bears win one more game or the Packers lose one more game, the Bears win the NFC North.\n\n3. Eagles (10-5) Clinched the NFC East.\n\n4. Panthers (8-7) In the driver's seat in the NFC South.\n\n5. 49ers (11-4) Currently own the tiebreaker over the Rams thanks to a better record in the NFC West.\n\n6. Rams (11-4) Losing to the Seahawks means they're likely to have to win three road games, instead of two home games, to reach the Super Bowl.\n\n7. Packers (9-5-1) Clinched a playoff berth. Would need to win both their remaining games and have the Bears lose both their remaining games to win the NFC North.\n\n8. Vikings (8-8) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n9. Lions (8-8) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n10. Buccaneers (7-8) Out of contention for a wild card, but they can still win the NFC South.\n\n11. Cowboys (7-8-1) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n12.

    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts (8-7) have been eliminated from AFC playoff contention. They won seven of their first eight games before the schedule toughened, quarterback Daniel Jones suffered two injuries and the defense sometimes struggled late.\n\nHere are the 10 players who will count the most toward their 2026 salary cap — which won't be known until the spring but is project to be in the $304 million range.\n\n(2026 salary cap hit, per Spotrac, with final season of current contract)\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $29 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: The sixth-year veteran led the Colts with 76 catches and 7 receiving touchdowns through 15 games. He averaged 10 yards per catch. He had 9 receptions in a game twice.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $26.6 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: The 10th-year veteran has missed five games with a neck injury and was placed on season-ending IR; it's the second straight season he missed at least five games. Through 15 weeks, he had 27 tackles 4 sacks and 13 quarterback hits.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $24.2 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: Another year, another Pro Bowl. The left guard has been so honored in all eight seasons, and he has been an All-Pro three times.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $20.2 million, 2027\n\n2025 performance: The 8th-year player signed for 3 years up to $54 million in the offseason. However, his 2025 was interrupted three times by concussions. He appeared in 7 games with 25 tackles, 7 passes defended and a fumble recovery.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $17.5 million, 2029\n\n2025 performance: The 2022 3rd-round draft by the Colts helped Quenton Nelson anchor the left side of the offensive line before an elbow injury knocked him out for a game.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $15.6 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: The 6th-year player was in the NFL MVP conversation after scoring 3 touchdowns in a game 5 times in the Colts' first 10 games. As the Colts faded late, so did Taylor, averaging 70 rushing yards and scoring 2 total TDs in a late 5-game stretch.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $15 million, 2028\n\n2025 performance: In his first season with the Colts, the 5th-year player led them with 4 interceptions and 8 passes defended through 15 games. He also had 72 tackles.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $14.3 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: The 9th-year player had 49 tackles, 5 quarterback hits, 1/2 sack and 1 interception through 15 games.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $13.2 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: The 9th-year player had 44 tackles, an interception returned for a touchdown and 6 passes defended through 15 games.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $10.8 million, 2027\n\n2025 performance: The No. 4 overall pick of the 2023 draft appeared in 2 games before suffering an eye injury in a freak accident during pregame warmups in Week 6. Fun fact: Richardson had 1 completion in 2025 — to himself, for a 9-yard gain.\n\n(The team-specific numbers will change with each transaction)\n\nNFL 2026 projected salary cap, per Spotrac: $304.3 million\n\nColts 2026 salary cap space available: $53.9 million, 11th most\n\nColts active salaries for 2026: $249.6 million\n\nColts 2026 dead cap: $2 million\n\nJoel A.

With that comes the matchups that will be set soon and the playoff opponents for each team.\n\nAs we enter Week 17, the results of these games will shift who plays who, and we will track that all here.\n\nThe number one see gets a first-round bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs.\n\nEntering Week 17, the Denver Broncos have a chance to clinch the number one seed but it’s going to take a lot of work. It is likely to stretch to Week 18.\n\nPittsburgh can clinch the four seed with a win OR a Ravens loss.\n\n2. New England Patriots (12-3)* host 7. Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)*\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)* host 6. Houston Texans (11-5)*\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6) host 5. Buffalo Bills (11-4)*\n\nThe NFC bracket is wide open entering Week 17, but the Seahawks can clinch the one seed with a win and some NFC West help.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers can clinch the four seed with a win and a Buccaneers loss.\n\n2. Chicago Bears (11-4)* host 7. Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)\n3. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)** host 6. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)*\n4. Carolina Panthers (8-7) host 5. San Francisco 49ers (11-4)*\n\n*: Clinched playoff berth\n**: Clinched division title\n***: Clinched no. 1 seed\n\nSaturday 4:30 p.m. result: The Texans beat the Chargers 20-16 to punch their ticket to the playoffs and keep their AFC South hopes alive. They cannot be eliminated from division contention this week if the Jaguars win on Sunday. The result also secured the AFC West title for the Broncos and leaves open the door for the Broncos to clinch the No. 1 seed. Denver is guaranteed can clinch home field through the AFC bracket if the Patriots, Jaguars, and Bills all lose on Sunday.\n\nChristmas 8:30 p.m. result: Denver’s win moved the Broncos one step closer to locking up the AFC West, and perhaps the No. 1 seed in the conference. Denver can clinch the AFC West on Saturday if the Chargers lose or tie against the Houston Texans. The Broncos can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference this weekend, but they will need a lot of help to accomplish that goal. Denver locks up the No. 1 seed with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nChristmas 4:30 p.m. result: The Lions lost to the Vikings, which officially clinched a berth for the Packers and eliminated the Lions. That solidifies all but one team in the playoff field. The Packers currently hold the final wild card berth, but still have an outside shot at the NFC North title. The seeding is not set for the six teams already in the field. The final team to join the field will be the NFC South champion, and that team is all but certain to be the No. 4 seed.\n\nWe will update as more Week 17 results come in.",

    "fullText": "Lamar Jackson injury history: A complete timeline of injuries for Ravens QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere is no doubt Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is one of the most electrifying players in the NFL when healthy, but keeping him 100% healthy has been a challenge at times.\n\nBetween MVP campaigns in 2019 and 2023, Jackson ended two seasons on the sidelines due to injury, and 2025 quickly began to get away from the Ravens when another injury struck.\n\nIt’s likely no coincidence Jackson’s fully healthy seasons have been far and away his best. After recovering from injury in 2022, Jackson returned to MVP form, winning his second MVP award in 2023 before putting together an even more impressive campaign the following season from a statistical standpoint.\n\nHere’s a look back at Jackson’s injury history and how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nMORE:Explaining the Lamar Jackson trade rumors\n\nAfter missing one game for a pre-playoff break in 2019 and another due to COVID-19 in 2020, Jackson missed his first games because of injury in 2021.\n\nWhile a non-COVID illness initially cost him a game against the Chicago Bears in 2021, Jackson went on to miss the Ravens’ final four games of the season with a significant ankle sprain. He suffered the injury early in a loss to the Cleveland Browns in Week 14, and Baltimore limped to an 0-5 finish and missed the playoffs with Jackson out of the mix.\n\nJackson struggled to match his MVP production in 2022, throwing 10 touchdowns over his first three starts but just seven over his final nine before going down with a sprained PCL in his knee.\n\nDespite being labeled week to week and hoping for a playoff return, Jackson missed the final five games of the regular season and the Ravens’ wild-card matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals. Baltimore went 3-3 without Jackson, including a playoff loss, and some wondered whether he had played his last down as a Raven with his contract set to expire after the season.\n\nAfter plenty of speculation about his future, Jackson agreed to a five-year, $260 million contract extension to remain in Baltimore long term.\n\nMORE:Inside Lamar Jackson's family tree\n\nJackson suffered a hamstring injury against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4 of the 2025 season and didn't return for a month, missing games against the Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Bears with a bye week sandwiched in-between.\n\nThe injury cost Jackson a bit longer than he hoped, as the Bears game had been targeted by the Ravens as his potential return date, but he looked every bit like himself in his return against the Miami Dolphins. Unfortunately for Jackson, that momentum did not last.\n\nAfter returning from a hamstring injury, Jackson struggled to play anything like he did in 2024, throwing four touchdowns and five interceptions across seven starts following his return against the Dolphins.\n\nIn the meantime, Jackson battled various ailments that kept him out of practices. Jackson missed practice time with injuries to his ankle, toe and knee, also missing a practice due to illness. While those injuries never kept him out of a game, his performance appeared to be impacted by them.\n\nJackson exited a prime-time game against the New England Patriots with a back contusion and did not return. He was summarily ruled out of the Ravens’ Week 17 game against the Packers. While Jackson did not receive a formal diagnosis beyond a “deep tissue bruise,” the injury was painful enough that he could not return to a pivotal game against an AFC contender.\n\nMORE: Where does Lamar Jackson rank among the 13 greatest Ravens of all time?\n\nBefore his back contusion deep into the 2025 season, Jackson missed 17 games over eight NFL seasons, including the playoffs. Here is the complete breakdown:\n\nJackson's 17 missed games include two due to pre-playoffs rest and two due to illness. His longest injury-related absence spanned six games, as Jackson missed the Ravens' final five regular season games and a playoff game with a sprained PCL in his knee in 2022.",

The Houston Texans beat the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday, which precludes Jacksonville from clinching the division title on Sunday if they beat the Colts. However, a win over Indianapolis would leave Jacksonville in first place holding a one game lead over Houston heading into Week 18.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars clinched a playoff berth this past week, but can clinch something more important in Week 17. They are in control of their fate in the AFC South and clinch the division title as soon as this week. They need a win and some help from their Houston division-mates.\n\nThe Jaguars face the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday and are 5.5-point favorites. Jacksonville will be without right guard Patrick Mekari due to a back injury, while center Robert Hainsey is questionable with a groin injury. The Colts will be without center Tanor Bortolini (concussion) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (back). Their list of questionable players includes cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and right guard Dalton Tucker (shoulder).\n\nIf the Jaguars clinch the AFC South, it would be their first playoff appearance and division title since 2022. That year, they beat the Chargers in the Wild Card round and then lost to the Chiefs in the Divisional Round. They have won their division four times prior to this sesason.\n\nThe Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win and a Texans loss or tie against the Chargers on Saturday. Houston is traveling to LA for the game and is a 1.5-point underdog.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nDenver Broncos: 13-3 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nNew England Patriots: 12-3 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nBuffalo Bills: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)",

    "fullText": "Update (Saturday): The Broncos have clinched the AFC West title. The Chargers lost 20-16 to the Texans on Saturday, which officially clinched the division title for Denver. They could clinch the top seed with some more help on Sunday, but for now they’re guaranteed a top three seed in the 2026 NFL Playoffs.\n\nUpdate (Christmas night): Denver’s win over the Chiefs on Christmas night keeps both of their scenarios alive for Week 17. The Broncos will clinch the AFC West with a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans on Saturday night. Denver can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nThe Denver Broncos travel to GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas night to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnd the Broncos can make it a wonderful Christmas for themselves and their fans with a win over their division rivals, and a little bit of help from around the rest of the league. Denver can clinch both the AFC West, and the No. 1 seed in the AFC, here in Week 17.\n\nThe Denver Broncos last won the AFC West back in 2015.\n\nPeyton Manning — yes, the guy from the commercials — was their starting quarterback.\n\nBut Denver can clinch the AFC West title this week, officially bringing to an end the Kansas City Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nNot only can Denver clinch the AFC West this weekend, but the Broncos also have a narrow path to clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC, something that again the team has not accomplished since that 2015 season.\n\nHowever, Denver would need a lot of help to wrap that up this weekend.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nSo you’re saying there’s a chance …\n\nHere are the full AFC standings heading into Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC West standings entering Week 17\n\nHere are the full AFC West standings with two weeks left in the season:\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x",

    "fullText": "The NFL has fined Chicago Bears defensive end Austin Booker for a couple of illegal hits on Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love in last Saturday night's game, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nBooker was fined $11,636 total for his two hits on Love, including one that knocked Love out of the game with a concussion. It was the more controversial call of the two considering Love lowered his helmet to initiate helmet-to-helmet contact. But Booker was flagged, and now penalized, regardless.\n\nWhen Love exited the game, the Bears defense struggled against backup quarterback Malik Willis, whose mobility proved to be an issue. But Chicago's bend-don't-break defense, coupled with quarterback Caleb Williams' fourth-quarter heroics, was able to pull off an improbable 22-16 overtime win.\n\nMeanwhile, the NFL did not fine Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon for his late hit on wide receiver DJ Moore early in the first quarter. But Moore got the last laugh as he scored the game-winning touchdown in overtime with Nixon draped over him in the end zone.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears DE Austin Booker fined for two hits on Packers QB Jordan Love",

    "fullText": "After finishing their 2024 campaign with a 6-11 record and in fourth place in the NFC West, the San Francisco 49ers knew they needed to make changes, and that's exactly what they did.\n\nSan Francisco, still led by John Lynch and Kyle Shanahan, brought in a new defensive coordinator, made impactful trades and signed free agents that they hoped would contribute.\n\nLess than a year later, the 49ers are already stamped to go to the postseason and could finish as the top team in the conference if they win their final two games of the season.\n\nLooking back at all of the moves they made during the offseason, a few stand out, and Pro Football Focus' Bradley Locker even listed the signing of backup quarterback Mac Jones as one of the 20 best free-agent signings of 2025.\n\n\"As Purdy missed eight games due to a lingering early-season toe ailment, Jones stepped up masterfully in his stead,\" Locker wrote. \"The former Patriot posted a 76.0 PFF passing grade across his eight starts, racking up an 80.1% adjusted completion rate. Indeed, Jones still ranks 16th among quarterbacks in WAR despite not playing since Week 10.\n\nPurdy’s performance of late — highlighted by his 96.6 overall mark in Week 16 — has shut down the idea that Jones could have realistically supplanted him. Still, the former first-round pick acted as a lifeline to lift the 49ers to an 11-4 record.\"\n\nSigning Jones wasn't a no-brainer at the time, as he was coming off a tough end to his time in New England and a mediocre one-year stint in Jacksonville.\n\nHowever, Jones did well in his eight starts, leading San Francisco to a 5-3 record while completing 69.6% of his passes for 2,151 yards, 13 touchdowns and six interceptions.\n\nEven better, the deal Jones signed is for two seasons, so the 49ers could keep him around for 2026 or flip him for a draft pick or another player at a position of need this upcoming offseason.\n\nMore 49ers: 49ers won't have to face top Bears WR in Week 17 matchup\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: NFL analyst says 49ers made one of the 20 best signings last offseason",

Meanwhile, Los Angeles has also averaged 27.8 points across their past five home games.\n\nUltimately, both teams feature capable offenses led by experienced quarterbacks, and with defenses flagged so frequently week after week, it’s hard to see the Texans and Chargers going Under in ideal conditions at SoFi Stadium.\n\nHouston has surrendered the second-fewest yards and lowest EPA per play while allowing the fewest points per game and ranking second in turnover differential. The Texans also pace the NFL in pass rush win rate and rank second in run stop win rate, so there are a lot of feathers in the Houston hat.\n\nWhile the Chargers are definitely legit, I expect the makeshift Los Angeles offensive line to have its hands full on Saturday afternoon.\n\nTurning to the final leg of this same-game parlay, Houston star Nico Collins has cleared this total in six of the past eight games while averaging 5.3 receptions, 8.8 targets, and 90.1 receiving yards per game.\n\nThe Chargers haven’t been gashed through the air with the seventh-lowest yards per attempt allowed, but they have multiple cornerbacks considered day-to-day with injuries, and Collins is a matchup nightmare with a sizable 23.4% target share this season.\n\nNico Collins Over 63.5 receiving yards\n\nBolts quarterback Justin Herbert has topped this total in nine of 15 games this season, and he’s averaged 242.6 passing yards per home game this season.\n\nJustin Herbert Over 217.5 passing yards\n\nNico Collins Over 63.5 receiving yards\n\nSpread: Texans -1.5 (-105) | Chargers +1.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Texans -125 | Chargers +105\n\nOver/Under: Over 39.5 (-110) | Under 39.5 (-110)\n\nHouston has won six of its last 11 road games (+2.50 Units / 19% ROI).

    "fullText": "Broncos unlikely to break major team record which at one point seemed like a lock originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 1984 Chicago Bears are probably safe.\n\nThat season, they had 72 sacks in 16 games, still the most in NFL history. But at one point this season, the Broncos were on a torrid pace, racking up 46 sacks in their first 10 games and looking like they would shatter that mark.\n\nBut they have cooled off and after sacking Kansas City Chiefs third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun just one time on Christmas night, they will need a small miracle to break that record.\n\nThe Broncos have 64 sacks on the season and need eight to tie the Bears and nine to surpass them. They had one game this season – in Week 13 against the New York Jets– where they sacked Justin Fields nine times. But the Chargers, who the Broncos will face in Week 18, are not the Jets.\n\nIn the first meeting between the Broncos and Chargers this season, back in Week 3, the Broncos sacked Justin Herbert five times. The Chargers do have a depleted offensive line, but nine sacks is probably too much to ask for.\n\nSo what happened? Why did the Broncos' pass rush slow down?\n\nTheir opponents began to place much more focus on stopping the pass rush, realizing that the Broncos had an all-time great unit. Nik Bonitto hasn't had a sack in any of the team's last three games. Jonathon Cooper – who had seven sacks in the first nine games – has a total of one sack in the last seven games.\n\nWith that sack, the Broncos break the franchise's all time single season sack record.\n\nNew record: 64 and counting\n\n— Romi Bean (@Romi_Bean) December 26, 2025\n\nThat is the trend that the entire defense has been on. If Bonitto and Cooper are not going to threaten the quarterback, the team is not going to rack up any sacks. Over the course of the last three games, the Broncos have gotten sacks from the likes of Dondrea Tillman, Jonah Elliss, Malcolm Roach and even Riley Moss, but not their superstar edge rushers.\n\nThe 64 sacks the Broncos have gotten are already the most in franchise history and currently, good for 12th-most in league history.\n\nREAD: Houston Texans can help Broncos achieve their first goal on Saturday\n\nBut it does speak volumes for how good that Bears defense was to get 72, a mark the Broncos likely aren't going to touch, and they'll even have an extra game to do it as the Bears did that in a 16-game season while the league now runs a 17-game season.\n\nBroncos take former player from Chargers ahead of Week 18 showdown between teams\n\nBroncos hand out game ball to ironic player following big Christmas win over Chiefs\n\nBroncos earn first season sweep of Chiefs in over a decade, improve to 13-3 on the season\n\nDenver Broncos should ask Santa for these 4 things for Christmas\n\nBroncos on Christmas: Two of ugliest losses in recent team history came on the holiday",

There are still several great players available, and S Caleb Downs could be one of the top options. Safety is not a position of need for New Orleans, but this is all about the best player available and talent. Downs is one of the best players in the draft.\n\nIf positional value were removed, Downs would be in the race for #1 overall. He can play throughout the defense, is a great tackler, and plays like a cornerback in coverage. Instead of safety, where his central college position is, Downs could play slot corner for the Saints. This would both fill a need and add top-end talent to the roster. This would become an even better pick if Alontae Taylor, who is out of contract after this season, leaves in free agency.",

    "fullText": "Amidst departures to the NCAA transfer portal and opt outs for the Citrus Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, the Texas Longhorns received some positive news for the 2026 season on Friday when junior safety Jelani McDonald announced his return for his senior campaign.\n\nAt 6’2 and 199 pounds, McDonald has prototypical size and explosiveness for the position that could allow him to become one of the first safeties taken in the 2027 NFL Draft if he stays healthy and maintains his developmental trajectory.\n\nOut of Waco Connally, McDonald was a late riser in the 2023 recruiting class, receiving his offer from the Longhorns in October when he was committed to Oklahoma State. TCU also factored into McDonald’s recruitment, hosting him for an official and unofficial visit late in the process, but it was McDonald’s time on the Forty Acres in December that ultimately sealed his decision to spurn his father’s alma mater and signed with Texas.\n\nA triple jumper, high jumper, and basketball standout at Connally, McDonald played quarterback, wide receiver, and on defense in high school, allowing him to finish the cycle as a consensus four-star prospect ranked as the No. 74 player nationally and the No. 2 athlete, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.\n\nThe athlete classification certainly fit McDonald, as it wasn’t clear whether he would grow into a linebacker in college even as he displayed the ability to play cornerback despite his height. As a freshman, McDonald m0ved between nickel back, linebacker, cornerback, and safety.\n\nWhile McDonald developed behind the scenes shuffling through positions to determine his future role, he played on three special teams units for the Horns as a true freshman, recording two tackles against Oklahoma State in the Big 12 Championship game.\n\nAs a sophomore, McDonald showed signs of becoming a rising star as he was thrust into playing time due to injuries, totaling 33 tackles, one tackle for loss, one interception, and one pass broken up with four starts over 14 games.\n\nMcDonald took another step forward as a full-time starter in 2025, leading the team in tackles with 73 (43 solo) thanks to late-season injuries sustained by redshirt senior safety Michael Taaffe and junior linebacker Anthony Hill Jr., notching four tackles for loss, three interceptions, three passes broken up, and a fumble return.\n\nWith McDonald returning, Texas has one starter back at the safety position with Taaffe exhausting his eligibility.",

Statistically, they have the worst red-zone D in the league this season.”\n\nThe Patriots are giving up a staggering 74% of touchdowns when opponents reach the red zone, making it the worst rate in the NFL.\n\nNew England will likely face a handful of powerful offenses in the postseason, and it won’t be able to compete if it doesn’t limit opposing teams to field goals.\n\nThe Patriots need to focus on improving their red zone defense over the next two weeks, especially as they face the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, both of whom will be starting backup quarterbacks.\n\nWhy NFL Writer Would’ve Loved To See Myles Garrett On Patriots This Season",

    "fullText": "Houston (10-5) at Los Angeles Chargers (11-4)\n\nSaturday, 4:30 p.m. EST, NFL Network\n\nAgainst the spread: Texans 8-7, Chargers 9-6\n\nSeries record: Chargers lead 6-4.\n\nLast meeting: Texans beat Chargers 32-12 in NFC wild-card game in Houston on Jan. 11.\n\nLast week: Texans beat Raiders 23-21; Chargers beat Cowboys 34-17.\n\nTexans offense: overall (19), rush (23), pass (16), scoring (19).\n\nTexans defense: overall (1), rush (4), pass (4), scoring (1).\n\nChargers offense: overall (11), rush (6), pass (13), scoring (T-16).\n\nChargers defense: overall (3), rush (T-10), pass (6), scoring (8).\n\nTurnover differential: Texans plus-15; Chargers plus-3.\n\nCB Derek Stingley Jr. was selected as the AFC Defensive Player of the Week after returning an interception for his first career touchdown against the Raiders. He also forced a fumble and had a pass defensed in the win. The All-Pro is tied for the team lead with four interceptions and is the only player in the NFL to have at least four interceptions in each of the past three seasons. With Sunday’s performance, he became the first player in franchise history to have a forced fumble and an interception return for a touchdown in a game.\n\nRB Omarion Hampton had 85 yards rushing and a touchdown on 16 carries against the Cowboys, his most productive showing in three games since returning from a broken ankle. The rookie first-round pick from North Carolina has 516 yards on the ground and four total touchdowns in eight games. The Chargers will need to maintain offensive balance against the outstanding Texans defense.\n\nTexans DE Will Anderson Jr. vs. Chargers' offensive line. Improved pass protection kept QB Justin Herbert from being sacked in Dallas, which in turn allowed the offense to have one of its best performances of the season. However, the difference in quality between the Cowboys’ pass rush and what Anderson and company will bring is stark. Anderson has a career-high 11 1/2 sacks, and his 17 tackles for loss have been just as important in creating obvious passing downs. He has a tackle for loss in 10 of the past 11 games and all seven road games this season.\n\nTexans: RB Woody Marks and LB Azeez Al-Shaair are set to return after missing last week’s game with injuries. … LT Aireontae Ersery is listed as questionable and could miss the game with a thumb injury. … RT Trent Brown (ankle/knee) will not play.\n\nChargers: LT Jamaree Salyer (hamstring), return specialist Derius Davis (ankle), CB Benjamin St-Juste (shoulder) and rookie S R.J. Mickens (shoulder) have all been ruled out. … DL Teair Tart (groin) and RG Mekhi Becton (knee) are questionable. The Chargers estimated Becton would have been a full participant if they had practiced Thursday, which bodes better for his availability.\n\nThe Chargers won the most recent meeting in the regular season, leaving Houston with a 34-24 triumph on Oct. 2, 2022. … The Texans are facing the Chargers at SoFi Stadium for the first time. They came up with a 27-20 victory in September 2019 in their only other trip to Los Angeles since the Chargers left San Diego in 2017.\n\nThe Texans can clinch a playoff berth with a win or tie, or a loss or tie by the Colts. … Houston’s seven-game winning streak is the longest active streak in the NFL and tied for the second longest in franchise history behind a nine-game winning streak in 2018. … DeMeco Ryans is the first head coach in franchise history to win 10 games in three consecutive seasons. … Houston’s defense leads the NFL in yards (272.3) and points (16.6) allowed. … QB C.J. Stroud has had at least 200 yards passing in five straight road games. … RB Nick Chubb had 42 yards of offense last week and had 170 yards of offense and a touchdown in his only career game against the Chargers in 2021 while with Cleveland. … WR Nico Collins had 59 yards receiving last week for his eighth straight game with at least 55 yards receiving. He had seven catches for 122 yards and a touchdown in a playoff win over the Chargers last season. … The Chargers have won 11 games in consecutive seasons for the third time in franchise history (1979-80, 2006-07). … Jim Harbaugh is one of eight NFL head coaches to have multiple 11-win seasons with two different organizations. … The Chargers defense has 13 takeaways (three fumbles, 10 interceptions) in its past six games after getting eight through its first nine games. … Justin Herbert threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns against the Cowboys, his third game this season with multiple touchdowns passes and no interceptions. … WR Ladd McConkey needs two receptions to pass Keenan Allen (148) for most in Chargers history through a player’s first two seasons. … OLB Tuli Tuipulotu got his 13th sack of the season versus the Cowboys. He can become the fifth player in Chargers history with 14 or more in a season (Khalil Mack, Shawne Merriman, Leslie O’Neal, Lee Williams). … S Derwin James Jr. needs one sack to become the third player in NFL history with 600 tackles, 20 sacks and 10 interceptions in his first 100 games (Roquan Smith, Karlos Dansby).\n\nFacing two of the strongest rush defenses in the league, neither Omarion Hampton nor Woody Marks is likely to put up big numbers on the ground. Desperate fantasy owners with limited options will have to gamble that either tailback could make up for it as outlets in the passing game, as Marks was a tremendous receiver in college and Hampton has displayed good hands in his first season.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Rams (11-4) at Atlanta (6-9)\n\nAgainst the spread: Rams 11-4; Falcons 8-7\n\nSeries record: Rams lead 49-30-2\n\nLast meeting: Rams beat Falcons 31-27 on Sept. 18, 2022, in Inglewood, Calif.\n\nLast week: Rams lost at Seattle 38-37 in overtime; Falcons won 26-19 at Arizona.\n\nRams offense: overall (1), rush (5), pass (2), scoring (1).\n\nRams defense: overall (16), rush (12), pass (19), scoring (6).\n\nFalcons offense: overall (14), rush (8), pass (17), scoring (25).\n\nFalcons defense: overall (14), rush (25), pass (8), scoring (21)\n\nTurnover differential: Rams plus-12; Falcons plus-1\n\nLB Nate Landman had five tackles, a sack and a tackle for loss in the Rams’ loss to the Seahawks. Landman, who leads the team with 123 tackles and has forced four fumbles, has been a revelation for the Rams adding range and instincts at a position they have tended not to value. Landman, who played for Atlanta in 2022-24, will be important in trying to corral Falcons RB Bijan Robinson as both a runner and receiver.\n\nRobinson leads the NFL with 131.5 scrimmage yards per game. He needs 151 scrimmage yards to break William Andrews’ team record of 2,176 set in 1983. Robinson has at least 100 combined rushing and receiving yards in 10 games this season.\n\nRams WR Puka Nacua will be a difficult matchup against a short-handed Falcons secondary. Atlanta CB Mike Hughes is expected to miss his second consecutive game with an ankle sprain, leaving undrafted rookie Cobee Bryant and backup C.J. Henderson to work with starter A.J. Terrell. Henderson was signed from the practice squad last week and had a game-saving interception at Arizona. Nacua leads the NFL with 114 catches for 1,592 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nRams:: WR Davante Adams (hamstring) and RG Kevin Dotson (ankle) could be held out as the Rams will prioritize making sure both key players are ready for the playoffs. … S Quentin Lake (elbow) will return to practice next week and could be available for the regular-season finale against the Cardinals. … CB Roger McCreary is expected to play this week after sustaining a groin injury in his Rams’ debut Nov. 23 that led to a stint on injured reserve.\n\nFalcons: Hughes was declared unlikely to return this week by coach Raheem Morris and is expected to miss his second consecutive game. ... WR Drake London (knee) was limited in practice. London returned against Arizona after missing four games. He briefly left the game against the Cardinals after appearing to aggravate the injury but Morris expressed confidence in London's status this week. CB Clark Phillips III (triceps, illness) was designated to return from injured reserve on Wednesday.\n\nThe Rams have won the past two regular-season games against the Falcons, scoring at least 31 points in both games. … The Falcons ended Rams coach Sean McVay’s first season with a 26-13 victory in the NFC wild-card round in January 2018. … Atlanta has won both postseason matchups in this series, which goes back to 1966.\n\nRams QB Matthew Stafford needs two touchdown passes in his last two games to set a single-season career high. He had 41 scoring throws in 2011 with the Detroit Lions and again in 2021 with Los Angeles. … Stafford leads the NFL with 40 TD passes with only five interceptions. ... The Rams have scored 30 points in three straight games for the first time since 2018, when they did it in four straight. … Nacua had a career-high 225 yards receiving in the loss to the Seahawks. It was his third straight game with over 100 yards and sixth of the season. … The previous time the Rams led the league in scoring was in McVay’s first season as head coach in 2017. They have done it six times since the AFL-NFL merger. … TE Colby Parkinson has six touchdown receptions this season and needs one more to set the Rams’ single-season record at the position. … DL Kobie Turner got his first career interception against the Seahawks. Turner needs 2 1/2 sacks in his last two games to set a career high; he had nine sacks as a rookie in 2023. … Morris was the Rams defensive coordinator from 2021-23. ... Atlanta assistant coaches who previously worked on McVay's staff in Los Angeles: offensive coordinator Zac Robinson (2019-23), pass game specialist/game management Tim Berbenich (2023), offensive assistant K.J. Black (2022-23), assistant offensive line coach Nick Jones (2021-23) and director player performance John Griffin (2021-23). ... The Falcons rank second in the league with 50 sacks, five away from their team record of 55 set in 1997. ... Three of the Falcons' six wins came in prime-time games against Minnesota, Buffalo and Tampa Bay. Atlanta lost a prime-time game at San Francisco.\n\nFalcons TE Kyle Pitts has at least six catches in four straight games, including seven for 57 yards and a touchdown last week. His 395 receiving yards in the past four games are the most by a tight end in a four-game span in franchise history. Pitts has set career highs with 80 catches and five touchdown receptions this season and has been especially effective with Kirk Cousins at quarterback.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "A Florida man shot and killed his wife and shot his stepdaughter earlier this week before fatally shooting himself after an argument over an NFL game, authorities said.\n\nJason Kenney, 47, took his own life hours after killing his wife, Crystal Kenney, Dec. 22, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a press conference.\n\nJudd said the murder occurred after Crystal Kenney suggested to her husband that he turn off Monday’s NFL game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFlorida Man Facing Death Penalty For Killing 18-Year-old Girlfriend, Unborn Child After She Refused Abortion\n\nJason Kenney had been drinking, and the argument escalated, prompting his wife to tell her 12-year-old son to call 911.\n\nThe boy ran to a neighbor’s home when he heard gunshots. Responding deputies found Crystal Kenney dead and a 13-year-old girl who had been shot in the shoulder and face.\n\nShe is recovering in a hospital.\n\n\"She said, ‘I begged him, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, and he shot me anyway,’\" Judd said.\n\nArkansas Mom Found Shot To Death With Two Children Wrote Cryptic Facebook Post Months Before Killings\n\nThe boy was unharmed, as was Jason and Crystal’s 1-year-old daughter, who was home at the time of the shooting. She was found by deputies asleep in her crib.\n\nAfter the shooting, Jason Kenney fled and called his sister, who lives in upstate New York, Judd said. He told her he had \"done something\" wrong and that it would be the last time they would talk.\n\nHe then drove to his father’s home, where deputies found him. As deputies attempted to get him out of a shed, Jason fatally shot himself, Judd said.\n\nDuring a search of the family’s home, deputies found a note Crystal wrote to her husband urging him to get help.\n\n\"You’re drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God,\" the note states, Judd said.\n\nThe surviving children are in the custody of grandparents.\n\n\"The entire family was destroyed,\" Judd said. \"Our homicide detectives are distraught.

(KSNW) — From the moment they hit the gridiron, Mike and Blake Bell were inseparable.\n\nFor two identical twin brothers, a bond could be centered around anything, but for the Bell boys it was always football.\n\nFor nearly their entire lives, they were on the same team. In high school both attended Bishop Carroll, in college they both played for Colorado State, but on draft day things took a turn. Taken second overall by the Chiefs, Mike made Mark a promise.\n\n“The sports information guy said I needed to get over to Kansas City, and I told them, I wasn’t leaving until Mark got drafted,” said Mike Bell.\n\nAfter three rounds, Mark eventually got drafted in the fourth. In a time crunch, Mike would have to leave for Kansas City, but on the way there, he quickly learned that Mark was taken by an AFC West rival.\n\nMaize senior shooting guard leads by example on and off the field\n\n“I’m flying to Kansas City, and as I’m getting off the plane, the pilot comes out and says, I just wanna let you know they radioed up and your brother got drafted to the Seahawks,” said Mike Bell.\n\nThe two faced off twice a year on the opposite side of the ball, with Mike eventually getting the best of Mark in their NFL debut.\n\n“The first play wasn’t that good for me,” Mark said laughingly. “We had some really great memories, though. My mom and dad and the whole family would bring a bus down to Arrowhead to come watch us play, it was really special.”\n\nAnd with all of those great memories, come a legacy that the two brothers will share forever.\n\n“They remember us as the football guys, even though we’ve done different things since then, it’s amazing how that kind of follows you and it just goes with you for your whole life,” said Mike Bell.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

    "description": "The Broncos face the Chiefs in Kansas City on Christmas. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "When the NFL schedule makers sat down to craft the Christmas slate of games, they likely envisioned the clash between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs as a battle for the AFC West title.\n\nWhile the Chiefs have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Broncos can wrap up their first AFC West title since 2015 with a win tonight, and a little bit of help from the Houston Texans on Saturday. In addition, Denver can also secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but they will need a little more help here in Week 17 to clinch the top seed.\n\nLet’s start with the AFC West title. Denver can clinch the division title this week, officially bringing to an end the Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nIn addition, Denver can also wrap up the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week, and the lone bye week in the AFC playoffs.\n\nBut they would need a lot of help to get that done.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWith the Chiefs already eliminated from the playoffs, this game will not have any tiebreaker implications for the Chiefs and Broncos directly.\n\nBut it could play a role for the Broncos when it comes to seeding, in a very narrow scenario.\n\nLooking at the AFC West, the Broncos lead the division with a 12-3 record, while the Chargers are in second place with an 11-4 record. If Denver beats the Chiefs and the Chargers beat the Texans on Saturday, the two teams will meet in Week 18 with the division title up for grabs.\n\nWhy? Because the Chargers against Denver earlier this season, and another win in Week 18 in this scenario, would see the two teams finish at 13-4. The first tiebreaker in a division is head-to-head record, which woudl give the Chargers the AFC West title.\n\nThen the Broncos would be seeded somewhere from No. 5 to No. 7, depending on how the Bills finish, who could also end the year with a 13-4 record. If, again in this scenario, the Bills finish with the same 13-4 record as Denver, the tiebreaker will be conference record. Right now, Buffalo is at 8-3, and they have one AFC game remaining so they would finish at 9-3 in this scenario.\n\nDenver right now has a 7-3 record in AFC games, and would finish at 8-4 in this scenario, dropping them behind the Bills.\n\nAgain, this is a very specific hypothetical, but this game could matter in a tiebreaker scenario.",

    "fullText": "LSU Tigers star safety AJ Haulcy is ending his college football career as he declares for the NFL draft, per Hayes Fawcett of On3Sports.\n\nLike teammate Mansoor Delane, Haulcy transferred to the Tigers this past season with hopes of getting more eyes on him and building up his draft stock. Both players succeeded in big ways.\n\nHaulcy led LSU in tackles this past season with 88. He also added three interceptions, four passes broken up, and a forced fumble. He held his own in coverage and was a thumper in the run game. There's nothing else the Tigers could have asked him to do.\n\nThere was a four-week stretch where he finished with at least 12 tackles in each game. It felt like he was involved in every play that went into the box. His best individual game was in the losing effort against the Texas A&M Aggies, when he had 12 tackles with an interception and a pass break up.\n\nThe Texas native is a major college football success story. He came out of high school as a three-star recruit. 247Sports had him ranked as the 150th best safety in that class and the 266th best player in his home state.\n\nHe was viewed with more respect as a transfer, but he still ended up outplaying those expectations. He was the 151st player in the portal and the third-ranked safety. Now, he's going to be one of the first safeties taken in the NFL draft, receiving some second-round evaluations.\n\nHaulcy now becomes the third player from this Tigers team to declare for the draft, joining Delane and Aaron Anderson.",

    "fullText": "Chiefs vs. Broncos live score, updates, highlights from 2025 NFL Christmas game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Broncos\n\nThe NFL on Christmas Day delivers an AFC West rivalry matchup unlike any seen in the last decade, as the Denver Broncos (12-3) travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs (6-9) at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nIn a stunning reversal of roles, the Broncos enter as the dominant force, aiming to secure the AFC West title and remain firmly in the driver's seat for the conference's crucial No. 1 overall seed and the coveted first-round bye. With the Los Angeles Chargers breathing down their necks, a victory over the crippled Chiefs would officially clinch the AFC West for Denver, ending Kansas City's unprecedented nine-year reign as division champions and marking this holiday game as perhaps the most significant in Denver's last ten years.\n\nFor the three-time defending AFC Champion Chiefs, this prime-time holiday slot is a bittersweet stage for an unfamiliar role. Having already been officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era, the Chiefs have seen their season completely unravel, suffering a losing record for the first time since 2012. The franchise is currently battling devastating injuries, with Mahomes and his backup Gardner Minshew both sidelined by ACL injuries, leaving the offense to be managed by third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun. The team that was once the gatekeeper of the AFC has become a hollow shell of its dynasty self.\n\nThe stark contrast in stakes presents a unique challenge to the streaking Broncos, who must overcome a late-season loss to the Jaguars that snapped their 11-game winning streak. Head Coach Sean Payton is stressing focus, emphasizing that despite the Chiefs' struggles, a division title and the No. 1 seed are still their stated goals. A win in Kansas City, where the Broncos have historically struggled, would not only solidify their resurgence but would also serve as the ceremonial passing of the torch, ushering in a new era of dominance in the AFC West.\n\nThis Christmas night contest marks a seismic shift in the AFC power structure. What was once the annual, late-season coronation of the Chiefs is now the potential crowning moment for the Broncos — a team ready to reclaim the top spot in the AFC West and send a clear message to the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Chiefs vs. Broncos on Christmas.

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Playoffs get started on Saturday, January 10 with four teams kicking off the Wild Card round. The playoff field will feature 14 teams with 12 of them playing that first weekend and the No. 1 seed in each conference getting a bye to the Divisional Round. This year, the opening round features two games on Saturday, three games on Sunday, and one game on Monday.\n\nEight teams will face off in the Divisional round, with that weekend featuring two games on Saturday the 17th and two games on Sunday the 18th. The Conference Championship round follows with the final four teams facing off on Sunday the 25th. The final two teams square off in Santa Clara, California at Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, February 8, 2026.\n\nThe field is slowly filling up as teams punch their ticket for the 2026 NFL Playoffs. Below is each team that has clinched a playoff berth.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (34-26) to improve to 12-2.\n\nThe Broncos have not won a lot of pretty games this season, but they keep on chugging along. Bo Nix has made plays when they’ve mattered most and the Broncos have emerged as arguably the best team in the AFC. They clinched their playoff berth with a comeback win over the Packers and moved a game up on the Patriots for the No. 1 seed. They remain two games up on the Chargers and can clinch the AFC West title and the No. 1 seed with a win and some help in Week 16.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Detroit Lions (41-34) to improve to 11-3\n\nWeek 16 update: The Rams lost to the Seahawks in overtime on Thursday Night Football to drop to second place in the NFC West, pending the outcome of 49ers-Colts on Monday. LA is now 11-4.\n\nThe Rams are playing as well as anybody right now and are headed back to the playoffs. They fell behind by ten points against Detroit, but a big third quarter got them back and they controlled things in the fourth quarter. They are tied with the Seahawks atop the NFC West, but hold the tiebreaker edge for the time-being due to their first head-to-head win over Seattle back in Week 11. The two squads face off in Week 16 with first place in the division and the No. 1 seed in the NFC on the line.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Seahawks (38-37) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Seahawks won a wild overtime thriller over the Rams to clinch a playoff berth. More importantly than securing a playoff berth, the Seahawks moved into first place in the NFC West and took over the No. 1 seed in the conference. They’ve won five straight and close out the season one the road against the Panthers and 49ers. The division title will likely go down to the wire in Week 18.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Washington Commanders (29-18) to improve to 10-5.\n\nThe Eagles have struggled in recent weeks after a 4-0 start, but they are headed back to the playoffs. They rolled over the Commanders in the second half to clinch the NFC East title. It was their second straight win after losing three straight to the Cowboys, Bears, and Chargers. They will head into Week 17 sitting a game back of the Bears for the No. 2 seed and two back of the Seahawks for the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nThe 49ers still have to play on Monday Night Football, but they got good news on Sunday with the Lions loss to the Steelers. San Francisco still has a chance at the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the conference, but they at least know they are officially headed back to the playoffs. They host the Bears in Week 17 and finish the season against at home against the Seahawks.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (22-16) to improve to 11-4, coupled with the Detroit Lions losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nChicago has bigger things in mind, but they at least know they’ll be playing in the postseason. The Bears win the Packers firmed up their lead in the NFC North, and they now have a division-clinching scenario in Week 17. The Bears travel to face the 49ers next week and close out the season at home against the Lions.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Baltimore Ravens (28-24) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Patriots held off Derrick Henry and the Ravens to punch their ticket to the 2026 NFL Playoffs. They remain a game up on the Bills in the AFC East and can clinch the division title next week with a win and a Bills loss. They also moved into a tie with the Broncos for the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Denver has the tiebreaker heading into Week 17 based on the common games tiebreaker.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Denver Broncos (34-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Jaguars are headed back to the playoffs for the first time in three years. They clinched a wild card berth, but will be more focused on the division title. They head into week 17 with an 11-4 record and a one-game lead on the Texans for the division title. They sit in third place in the overall NFC standings and are a game back of the Patriots and Broncos for the top two seeds.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Cleveland Browns (23-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Bills punched their ticket, but the division title is still a possibility. The Patriots lost in Week 16, and the Bills win moved them to only a game back in the division. Buffalo is currently the sixth seed and is riding a four-game win streak as they head toward the playoffs.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Dallas Cowboys (34-17) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Chargers are headed back to the playoffs for a second straight season. They are guaranteed a spot, but still have a shot at the AFC West title. The Broncos loss in Week 16 allowed the Chargers to cut the division lead to one game with two weeks remaining. The Chargers and Broncos face off in Denver in Week 18, so if both teams win in Week 17, that game will be for the division title, and maybe the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Minnesota Vikings (23-10)\n\nThe Packers had two clinching scenarios, one if they won or tied their game against the Ravens on Saturday of Week 17, and one if the Lions lost or tied their game against the Vikings. Detroit ended up losing and Green Bay punched their ticket. The Packers are effectively two games back of the Bears in the NFC North, but they still have a chance at the division title if they can win out and the Bears lose out.",

    "description": "The Lions face the Vikings in Minneapolis on Christmas Day. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "Game result: The Lions are officially done for the season. They have one more game, but they will not be headed to the playoffs. They committed six turnovers, including five by quarterback Jared Goff in a 23-10 loss to the Vikings. The Lions defense kept the team in it, holding the Vikings to only two touchdowns in spite of all the turnovers, but Detroit’s offense could get nothing done.\n\nThe Lions loss also helped the Packers punch their playoff ticket. Green Bay could have clinched their own spot with a win on Saturday over the Ravens, but now they head into that game looking to gain ground on the Bears in the NFC North.\n\nThe Detroit Lions sit on the verge of playoff elimination and need help the final two weeks of the 2025-26 NFL regular season. They can help themselves to start when they face the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas Day. The game kicks off at 4:30 p.m. ET and Detroit is a 5.5-point road favorite.\n\nThis is the second matchup of the season between these two teams. The Vikings won 27-24 in the first game in Detroit. J.J. McCarthy made his return from a high ankle sprain to throw for two touchdowns. The team added 142 rushing yards and held the Lions ground game to just 65 in the win. McCarthy will not play in this game due to a fracture in his throwing hand. Max Brosmer will get the start in his place.\n\nThe Lions had a chance to climb back into the mix last week, but a loss to the Steelers cost them. They have no control over their destiny and could be eliminated regardless of their outcome this week. The Lions are eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to the Vikings or if the Packers win or tie against the Ravens on Saturday. Green Bay is a 2.5-point favorite at home in that game.\n\nEven if the Lions win and the Packers lose, they would still need to win in Week 18 at the Bears and have the Packers lose on the road to the Vikings. It’s possible this could happen, but the odds are not great.\n\nUsing The Athletic playoff simulator, the Lions currently have a 4% chance of making the playoffs. If they beat the Vikings and the Packers lose to the Ravens, their chances increase to 14%.\n\nTiebreakers don’t matter in this situation due to the Packers having a tie on their record. Green Bay has the head-to-head tiebreaker over Detroit, but if the Lions tie the Vikings or Bears to close they season, they are eliminated from playoff contention.",

    "description": "Will we see Luke in an NFL uniform?",
    "fullText": "On Dec. 22, 2022, Bret Bielema received a Christmas present from Starkville, Mississippi: Ole Miss Quarterback Luke Altmyer transferring to the Illinois Fighting Illini. With three years of eligibility remaining, it would give Bielema and the Illini some much-needed time and the option of stability under center.\n\nThe first year did not go entirely as planned. Altmyer got his feet wet, but his numbers were not that good. He played only nine games due to injury, but he had some good games that gave Illini fans an idea of what to expect, completing 175 passes in 270 attempts (64.8%). He threw for 1,883 yards (209.2 YPG) with 13 TD and 10 INTs (his QB rating was 131.9). He also rushed for 282 yards on 94 carries with three TDs.\n\nIn 2024, his improvement was nothing short of remarkable. Whereas the year prior, he looked rattled at times and unsure of where or when to throw the ball. In ‘24, he seemed more poised, more confident, and better able to read the field. He passed for 2,717 yards, 211 completions in 347 passes with 22 TDs and only six interceptions (a 144.0 QB rating). His rushing yards were down 217 yards on 99 carries with 4 TDs, but that was due to inconsistent line play, allowing 32 sacks.\n\nThis season, he has continued to improve. With a bowl game yet to play, he has already surpassed his yards total from last season, 2,811 yards on 226 of 332 passing. He has attained his highest completion percentage of 68.1% and his highest passer rating of 157.1. He has 21 TDs with only five interceptions.\n\nAltmyer will go down as one of the best quarterbacks in Illinois history. Many people have said he is the best QB at Illinois since Kurt Kittner, with some comparing his leadership to Jeff George. Here are some of the reasons why.\n\nMost TDs in a career tied for 2nd with Juice Williams at 56 (leader is Kurt Kittener with 64).\n\nMost passing yards he is 5th with 7,411(626 yards behind 4th place Juice Williams).\n\nCompletion percentage among starters is 1st at 64.5%.\n\nTD% % with over 500 attempts at 5.9.\n\nYards per play with over 1,000 yards 2nd 7.4 (John Paddock leads with 8.9).\n\nYards per game 3rd at 218 (Tony Eason is 1st with 300.4 and Dave Wilson is 2nd with 286.7)\n\nPasser rating as a starter (minimum 10 starts) at 145.\n\nHow he is looked at nationally:\n\nESPN has him rated as the 12th best in the NCAA this season\n\nProfootballnetwork.com has him listed as #8 in QB power rankings going into the upcoming bowl game.\n\nHe is in the top 25 nationally for completion percentage (68.1%) and passing touchdowns (21).\n\nMost draft analysts have Altmyer as a fifth to seventh-round draft pick. They cite him as being a stable NFL backup QB in a West Coast or RPO offensive scheme.\n\nAmong the attributes they like about him are his performance in clutch situations, his release and touch, his ability to throw high-velocity, accurate passes, his read progression in passing situations, his ability to navigate the pocket, his toughness, his preparedness, and his mental approach to the game.\n\nSome of the cons to his game are his frame, as they cite at 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds, whether he has the durability to withstand an NFL pass rush competition, a hitch in his throwing motion under pressure, the ability to throw in tight coverage, and an athletic ceiling not being a modern dual threat QB.\n\nHe is being compared to NFL backups Cooper Rush and Gardner Minshew in terms of his NFL trajectory. In four mock drafts I have seen so far, he could be taken in the fifth round by Tampa Bay, the sixth round by Minnesota, or the seventh round by either the Bears or Houston.\n\nWith one game to go and an invite to the Senior Bowl, it is a fair bet to say that in the fall of 2026, Luke Altmyer will be on an NFL roster somewhere, probably as a trusted backup. I can see the four teams mentioned in the mock draft models, but I would not rule out teams like Pittsburgh, San Francisco, New England, or Green Bay. Certainly, back-to-back bowl wins would improve his stock, as will a good showing in the Senior Bowl. All in all, the future looks very good for Luke Altmyer.",

    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders are hosting the Dallas Cowboys on Christmas day. This game doesn’t mean anything for the playoffs with both teams already eliminated. The Cowboys were knocked out of contention last week when the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Commanders to clinch the NFC East. Washington is down to their third-string QB in Josh Johnson, and they added last year’s third-string QB (Jeff Driskel) this week with both Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota out.

    "description": "Mile High Report’s Christopher Hart gives his picks for Week 17 of the 2025 NFL regular season.",
    "fullText": "Week 17 of the NFL regular season is upon us. Only two more weeks of regular season picks are left. My Week 16 picks were not optimal. I picked just 9 of 16 games correctly. Through fifteen weeks I’m now sitting at 160-80 with predictions. Let’s see if I can do better than I did last week.\n\nChristmas Day (Early Game) —Dallas Cowboys at Washington Commanders\n\nHad events played out differently in the regular season, this game could have been garnered huge playoff implications. Unfortunately, these NFC East rivals are both eliminated from playoff contention. I think the Cowboys end up winning this one on the road.\n\nChristmas Day (Afternoon Game) — Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe only way the Lions can make the playoffs is by winning out and the Packers losing their final two games. It’s a longshot, but stranger things have happened. Not that he has been great, but J.J. McCarthy won’t be playing in this one. That being said, I think Detroit will win this one easily.\n\nChristmas Day (Night Game) — Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Broncos lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars last Sunday. Denver still controls their own destiny and can earn the AFC’s top seed if they beat the Chiefs and Chargers the next two weeks. They’ve got a lot of mistakes to clean up, but I have a feeling they will deliver Broncos Country a present on Christmas night and beat Kansas City.\n\nSaturday Football (Afternoon Game) — Houston Texans at Los Angeles Chargers\n\nBoth the Texans and Chargers are poised to make the postseason. The only question is will it be as a wildcard team or division champion. The stakes are huge for both of them. Houston’s defense has been the strength of their team and Justin Herbert has impressed despite numerous key losses to their offensive line. All things considered, I think DeMeco Ryans has his team ready to win this one.\n\nDeMeco Ryans on the game vs the Chargers:\n\n“No doubt about it. It’s defintley a playoff game. It was a playoff game for us last week. That’s where you want to be in December, playing meaningful games & that’s what this team has earned.” pic.twitter.com/sRbAg9pofV\n\n— Houston Stressans (@TexansCommenter) December 23, 2025\n\nSaturday Football (Evening Game) — Baltimore Ravens at Green Bay Packers\n\nThe Ravens aren’t out of the playoffs yet, but their chances of making the postseason are slim. Currently, the Packers are the NFC’s seventh seed and can punch their playoff ticket with a win. With a back contusion suffered in Week 16, there is a good chance Lamar Jackson doesn’t play. If so, that should make the Packers heavy favorites in this one. I’m taking Green Bay at home.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Arizona Cardinals at Cincinnati Bengals\n\nThis Sunday game is an uninteresting matchup with two teams out of playoff contention. After laying a goose egg a few weeks ago, the Bengals kicked things into high gear last weekend and scored a lot of points. I think they will do the same on Sunday, as the Cardinals are in a tailspin having lost seven games in a row. I’m picking Cincinnati.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Pittsburgh Steelers at Cleveland Browns\n\nThe formula is simple for the Steelers to make the postseason. A win over the Browns guarantees them the AFC North title and the opportunity to host a Wild Card round playoff game. Could the Browns play spoiler? Sure, but don’t count on that. I’m confident that Pittsburgh takes care of business here.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — New Orleans Saints at Tennessee Titans\n\nThe Saints have won three in a row and are now 5-10 on the season. Meanwhile, the Titans are a 3-12 team coming off a victory against the Chiefs in Week 16. There isn’t anything compelling about this matchup to really write about. That being said, I’ll take New Orleans on the road.\n\nTHREE IN A ROW DUBS#Saints | @Gatorade pic.twitter.com/br2Fm49xjA\n\n— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) December 21, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis Colts\n\nThe Jaguars earned a playoff berth defeating the Broncos last weekend. They have a path to the AFC’s top seed, though it will take some help. In order for that to happen, beating the Colts who have dropped five games in a row is a must. Based on what I saw against Denver last Sunday, I like their chances against Indianapolis.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Miami Dolphins\n\nThe Buccaneers started off the season hot but have dropped three games in a row. They have to win this game, and the Panthers need to lose against the Seahawks in order to keep their postseason hopes alive. I’m expecting both of those things to happen, with the Week 18 Buccaneers/Panthers matchup deciding who wins the NFC South.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — New England Patriots at New York Jets\n\nThe Patriots have a path to the top seed in the AFC. In order for that potentiality to become reality, finding a way to beat the Jets on the road needs to take place. I have no concerns about their ability to do so. I don’t think this game will be close at all. I’ve got New England winning on the road in a landslide.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Seattle Seahawks at Carolina Panthers\n\nThe Seahawks defied the odds and rallied late to defeat the Rams in Week 16, whilst the Panthers were able to defeat Tampa Bay. Both these teams want this game. Seattle winning would pretty much assure them the top seed in the NFC. A Panthers win would give them a shot at the NFC South title if the Buccaneers wind up losing. A lot is at stake in this one, but I think Seattle gets a huge road win.\n\nThe Rams would be eliminated from both the #1 seed and NFC West title race if the Seahawks beat the Panthers and the 49ers beat the Bears in Week 17. pic.twitter.com/5H1p6Zi0Ba\n\n— Brian Nemhauser (@hawkblogger) December 23, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — New York Giants at Las Vegas Raiders\n\nSporting 2-13 records, the Giants and Raiders are the worst teams in their respective conferences. The loser of this game will have the upper hand relative to earning the #1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. But maybe something crazy happens and it ends in a tie. Who knows? I don’t really care. I’ll just pick the Giants for the heck of it.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills\n\nBoth the Eagles and Bills have clinched playoff berths. Philadelphia won the NFC East and will get to host a playoff game. The Bills aren’t out of the AFC East race yet but need some help for that to happen. I ultimately expect the Patriots to take that division. Even so, I think the Bills beat the Eagles. It should be a fun matchup either way.\n\nSunday Night Football — Chicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers\n\nBoasting 11-4 records, the Bears and 49ers are also in the postseason. Each team has a slim path to the top seed in the NFC. What both of them have accomplished this year is impressive. I certainly didn’t have either of them securing 11 wins this season. This might be the most fun matchup of Week 17 and should be a great primetime game for all football fans to enjoy. I’m taking the 49ers in this one.\n\nMonday Night Football — Los Angeles Rams at Atlanta Falcons\n\nThe Rams definitely need to find a way to win this game after being stunned by the Seahawks in Week 16. Dropping that game plummeted their chances of being the NFC’s top seed. I’ve got Los Angeles winning this one. And guess what? A victory will make the first-round pick they get from Atlanta better in the ‘26 NFL Draft.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys will travel to Maryland to face the Washington Commanders on Christmas Day.\n\nBoth these NFC East teams are eliminated from postseason contention. However, they'll be the opening act for the NFL on Christmas.\n\nThe Cowboys' season was a tale of two sides of the ball. The Dallas offense was one of the more exciting units in the entire league. With Dak Prescott playing at an elite level, throwing the ball to both CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, it was thrilling to watch the Cowboys' offensive attack.\n\nHowever, their defense was one of the worst in the NFL. It got so bad that Jerry Jones brought in some defensive assets to help the struggling unit. While it seemed to improve the defense's overall state, it was not enough to save their season.\n\nAs for the Commanders, it was an unlucky season to say the least. Every week it felt like another key player on their team was injured. Whether it was Jayden Daniels, Terry McLaurin, Austin Ekeler and the list goes on.\n\nWhile neither team has anything to gain, there's always a level of effort for divisional games.\n\nHere's how to listen to Commanders vs. Cowboys on Christmas.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channel 225 (away), 226 (home)\n\nCommanders radio channels: BIG 100 (WBIG-FM 100.3 FM)\n\nCowboys radio channel: 105.3 The Fan (KRLD-FM)\n\nThe Commanders vs. Cowboys game can be listened to on SiriusXM on channels 225 (Cowboys), and 226 (Commanders)\n\nLocally, fans in the Washington area can tune into BIG 100 (WBIG-FM 100.3 FM). In Dallas, fans can listen on 105.3 The Fan (KRLD-FM).\n\nIf you are a new subscriber to SiriusXM, you can get your first month for free. Listen to every NFL game live, plus other sports like college football, MLB, NBA, NHL, NASCAR and more.

Obviously, many people will be watching on Netflix. Every single time you see one of those guys run on the field with the orange gloves and say, TV timeout, or the players get a breather, they'll throw it back to the studio,\" said Long, \"Scott and I will be covering all the happenings from that drive, looking ahead, all the storylines you could think of.

I believe this aligns with the 'MO' (Main Objective) in Detroit. We've got to earn it. We've got to scratch and claw.\"\n\nKansas City notably defeated Detroit earlier this season in Week 6 at Arrowhead Stadium, while the Vikings will play spoiler as hosts of the second game of the doubleheader.\n\n\"The Minnesota Vikings. I mean, I don't know if you're on social media, but there's been a lot of memes about the Minnesota Vikings, particularly their young quarterback, and what I've seen is that the defense has rallied around this guy. \"The protectors on the offensive side rally around this guy,\" said Long. \"You take a look around the NFC North, and the Bears and the Packers are the two teams most likely to make the playoffs. These two teams are fighting for respect, and they know that next year starts now, especially for a guy like J.J. McCarthy. We know how good their coach is. We know about their defense, but the one big question mark is that quarterback. So we're going to find out more about that on Christmas.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kyle Long explains his role on Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

    "fullText": "NFL execs recently weighed in on who they believe should be the NFL's Coach of the Year, and among those mentioned was the Jacksonville Jaguars' Liam Coen.\n\nThe NFL Network's Tom Pelissero polled 30 execs, asking them to vote on who they believe should win each major end-of-season award, such as MVP, Coach of the Year, and others.\n\nWhen it came to Coach of the Year, New England's Mike Vrabel was the clear-cut winner if it were up to the NFL execs. He received 13 votes.\n\nChicago's Ben Johnson was second with six votes, while Coen was third with four votes.\n\nUnder Coen, the Jaguars have made one of the biggest turnarounds in football, going from four wins a season ago to 11 wins with still two games left in the regular season.\n\nJacksonville has clinched a playoff spot, but they also still find themselves in the mix for the AFC's No. 1 seed.\n\nTrevor Lawrence is playing some of the best football of his career over the last month under Coen. The offense has scored 30-plus points in five of their last eight games as well.\n\nNot to be overlooked either is the staff that Coen has assembled around him, which includes offensive coordinator Grant Udinski and defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile, who has turned the Jaguars into a takeaway-heavy defense.\n\nHowever, perhaps what stands out the most about this Coen-led Jaguars team is their resiliency.\n\nAfter blowing a 19-point fourth-quarter lead to Houston, the Jaguars were 5-4, and it felt like a fork in the road moment for this team. But since then, Jacksonville has won six games in a row, which tells us a lot about the makeup of this team under Coen's leadership.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: NFL execs put Jaguars Liam Coen in Coach of the Year conversation",

He's moving like the Lamar Jackson that we're used to\".\n\nBut if you look at his other injuries - toe, ankle, knee, and now his back - I feel like he's a bit more fragile at the moment, after all the hits he's taken. He's had injuries adding up over the years, so is his style of play sustainable?\n\nI really hope his Super Bowl window hasn't closed because he's so wonderful to watch.\n\nI just think there needs to be a bit of a shake-up at Baltimore because there were some odd moments in Sunday's game, with the play calling and top players making big mistakes in big moments. At the end of the season, someone's got to take responsibility.\n\nThe two main things they've struggled with is Lamar not being healthy and having zero pass rush. I just don't understand it - defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike went down early in the season, so why you wouldn't find an impact player from a pass-rush perspective?\n\nThe Ravens used to have this attitude. Teams used to be scared of that pass rush, that defensive line, and they've kind of lost that.\n\nIt's the same with the Bengals and Chiefs. Although you keep winning, and that means you don't have high draft picks, you've got to be able to build depth in those moments.\n\nIf you're investing on one side of the ball, you've got to draft on the other side. You've got to find ways to strengthen an already elite team - the team that's done it best is the Philadelphia Eagles and their general manager Howie Roseman.",

    "fullText": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (WGN) — While Caleb Williams, DJ Moore and the Chicago Bears’ offense received most of the praise for last weekend’s dramatic, come-from-behind victory over the Green Bay Packers, it would have never happened had it not been for kicker Cairo Santos.\n\nIn a press release on Wednesday, the NFL announced Santos was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for Week 16 after his efforts in the Bears’ 22-16 overtime win versus the Packers.\n\nHow improbable was the Chicago Bears’ OT win over the Green Bay Packers?\n\n“Cairo navigating the wind … It was just unbelievable with the gusty conditions out there. You guys saw all of the paper cups and all of the things flying and floating all over the field,” Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower said. “For him to have the mental fortitude to stay focused and play the conditions is what we talk about doing.\n\n“Not trying to beat the conditions, not being upset about the conditions, but play the conditions. I thought he did an excellent job of that and struck the ball really well … It helped us a ton.”\n\nSantos converted all three of his field goal attempts in a driving wind—from 46, 51 and 43 yards—and his lone point-after attempt. He was also the only NFC kicker to score at least 10 points and make 100% of his kicks, including one from 50 yards or longer.\n\n“It was super gusty. It was a tough day today,” Santos said after the game. “My first 46-yarder was against the wind, and all the other ones were with the wind. IN the fourth quarter, we were kicking with the wind, but it was more of a crosswind. So, we just had to play a perfect ball and trust it.”\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, wind gusts reached as high as 25-30 mph on Saturday at Soldier Field.\n\nOn top of his ten points scored, he also helped Chicago’s special teams unit recover an onside kick with 1:59 remaining in regulation against Green Bay.\n\n“Cairo’s done so much work on campus here, and he’s done it in the offseason too—I’m talking about all different types of kicks,” Hightower said. “I’ve tried to stop him at times from kicking onside kicks so much, like, ‘Hey, it’s time to go in.’ And he keeps doing it. There’s so much work that’s been put in from that standpoint that it’s not an accident.\n\n“He put work in for it and he hit a really good ball.”\n\nHis one make from 50+, a 51-yarder in the fourth quarter, was his 25th made field goal of 50-plus yards as a member of the Bears, the most by any kicker in franchise history.\n\n“I don’t have many words, man. It’s special to do this with you guys—coaches, players,” Santos said after receiving a game ball from Ben Johnson in the postgame locker room.\n\nOver the last two seasons, under Special Teams Coordinator Richard Hightower, the Bears have earned five Special Teams Player of the Week awards, tied with the Denver Broncos for the most in the NFL.",

To do that for 19 seasons is incredible. You want that in your leader…He’s a Hall of Famer in my view, and I’m just really happy for him to see him recognized properly.”\n\nTomlin has received a good amount of praise and respect over the last few days just weeks after many fans and media members were calling for the Steelers to fire him.

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

The investigation will focus on if the fan violated the Lions' guest code of conduct.\n\nHere is the Lions fan code of conduct. The team found no violation and does not plan to action against the fan, who identified himself to the @freep as Ryan Kennedy. But the NFL is now following up with the team after hearing from DK Metcalf and others in his appeal hearing. pic.twitter.com/H4nyqbLX1K\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 24, 2025\n\n“The matter remains under review,” an NFL spokesman told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review in an email.\n\nMetcalf's two-game suspension was upheld, the league announced Tuesday evening, ending his regular season.\n\nThe incident occurred in the second quarter of Sunday's game. While the Lions' offense was on the field, Metcalf approached a fan sitting in the front row and wearing a blue wig. After exchanging words with the fan, Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at the fan's head.\n\nWhile the incident was captured on the broadcast, it was not seen by officials.\n\nDK Metcalf appears to have an altercation with a Detroit fan pic.twitter.com/a478Zjg3tR\n\n— NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) December 21, 2025\n\nBecause of that, Metcalf was not penalized and was not ejected from the contest.\n\nThe fan claimed Metcalf threw a punch because the fan taunted the wideout with his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius.\n\nOn Monday, however, sources told Tom Pelissero of NFL Network that the fan used a derogatory term when taunting Metcalf about his mother. That source also claimed the fan called Metcalf \"something we both know you don't call a Black man.\"\n\nThe fan's attorney released a statement Monday calling the allegations against the fan, Ryan Kennedy, \"completely false.\"\n\n\"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the 'N-word,' the 'C-word,' or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game.\n\n\"These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nDuring his Tuesday news conference, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said that although he doesn't condone Metcalf's actions, he supports the wide receiver.\n\n“He did explain to me why he did what he did, and I certainly don’t condone the behavior, but I support DK,\" Tomlin said. \"And I really don’t have a lot to add other than what I just told you.\"\n\nKennedy was escorted from his seat but not ejected from the stadium. The Lions told The Athletic on Tuesday that the team did not plan to take action against Kennedy.\n\nThe Steelers finish the regular season against the Cleveland Browns this Sunday and the Baltimore Ravens in Week 18. Pittsburgh can wrap up the AFC North title this week by beating Cleveland or with a loss by the Ravens to the Green Bay Packers.",

    "description": "Here’s how we think the Denver Broncos will do vs the Kansas City Chiefs during Week 17 action in the NFL.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos will look to turn the page quickly on their tough loss a few days ago with a road win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. The Chiefs are down to their third string quarterback and have nothing left to play for. This is a game the Broncos should win and if they don’t, then the real questions begin.\n\nWe’re pretty confident that this won’t be the case. The Broncos should coast to victory like they did against Kansas City in the final game of last season when they were resting starters instead of being long-eliminated from contention.\n\nDenver Broncos at Kansas City ChiefsP.M. Mile High time\nGEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri\nATS Betting Lines: Denver -13.5\nMoneyline Odds: Denver -1200 / Kansas City +750\nOver/Under: 36.5\nNote: All odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nCollectively, our Mile High Report staff is predicting a Broncos 27-11 win on the road over the Chiefs. Here’s how each of us predicted things would go individually:\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe line in this game is crazy…. if only because the over/under stands at 36.5. They expect the Chiefs offense to sputter and the Broncos offense to be ho-hum. I checked the weather and that isn’t going to be a factor at all it appears. Given all that, I’ll be cheeky here and predict a backdoor cover and an under. Now I just wait for the officiating crew to make it happen! – Tim Lynch\n\nThis one isn’t difficult. The Broncos should beat the Chiefs. It shouldn’t be close. The defense will be looking to make a statement, which should mean bad things for a 3rd string QB. Bo Nix will want some redemption from the loss to Jacksonville. – Adam Malnati\n\nAfter an incredible 11-game winning streak, the Broncos finally suffered their first loss since Week 3 of the regular season. On Christmas, they will play the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Even though the Chiefs will be playing their third-string quarterback, Denver can’t underestimate their division rival. The Broncos have to play a complete game, limit the miscues and mistakes, and find a way to win. Their hopes of an AFC West title and #1 seed depend on it. Ultimately, I believe the Broncos can bounce back to get their thirteenth win of the season. – Chris Hart\n\nNix and the Broncos should win this game. As others have noted, KC is down to their third-string QB and have been eliminated from the AFC Playoffs. But crazy things happen in December at Arrowhead. So Denver can’t look passed this game or just lollygag and expect to get the win. Approach this game like a must-win game, which it is, and put the poor showing against the Jags behind everyone. Take nothing for granted, play a complete game, and make Chiefs Kingdom’s Christmas a little less enjoyable. – Ian St. Clair",

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals need a quarterback this offseason. The question is whether they'll be able to find one in the first round of the NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "How have we gotten here? This Arizona Cardinals’ season was supposed to lead to the playoffs. At the very least, it was supposed to lead to contention. Christmas week should have been about setting the stage for a heavyweight showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nInstead, the Bengals are 5-10 and the Cardinals are somehow even worse, at 3-12.\n\nSo now, that familiar time of year has arrived, far earlier than anyone had hoped. It’s mock draft season.\n\nThis year’s draft class is widely considered to be a thin group, but that’s OK for the Cardinals. They currently hold the No. 6 pick. The big question, though, is where they’ll be able to find their quarterback of the future.\n\nSo for the first time, here are our top 10 projected picks of the 2026 NFL Draft. As always, this mock draft is without trades.\n\nIf the Giants do ultimately end up with the No. 1 pick, a trade becomes highly likely. New York already has a promising young quarterback, Jaxson Dart, while the rest of the top 10 is packed with quarterback-needy teams — including the Cardinals, of course.\n\nWould Arizona pony up the package required for the top selection? That’s a question for general manager Monti Ossenfort and, potentially, head coach Jonathan Gannon, if he retains his job. But it might be the best path to a quarterback, given the teams currently ahead of them.\n\nIf the Giants beat the Raiders this week, though, Las Vegas will jump into the No. 1 spot. Unlike the Giants, the Raiders desperately need quarterback help and would not likely trade the pick.\n\nAs for Reese, he could be the top non-quarterback off the board, as a versatile, explosive player who can line up off the edge or at linebacker. It’s just unlikely it will actually be at the No. 1 pick after trades.\n\nMendoza, this year’s Heisman Trophy winner, is noted for his elite football intelligence and ability to play on-time within an offense. If this Cardinals’ coaching staff remains in place, that will be an appealing proposition, given that they preferred Jacoby Brissett to Kyler Murray for those reasons. The problem will be getting a high enough draft pick to secure Mendoza, who is the betting favorite for the top pick.\n\nSome expect Moore to remain in school, as he has made just 18 career starts and could earn a nice NIL payday if he returned to Oregon. But as his draft stock climbs, so too do his chances of declaring. That would be a major boost for the Cardinals, who need as many quarterbacks as possible in this class to help their chances of finding one. On the field, Moore stands out with his accuracy and creativity as a passer.\n\nAs has been the case for most of the past five decades, the Jets need a quarterback this spring. But if they end up behind the Raiders and Browns, that might require a trade up. Fortunately for New York, they have five first-round picks over the next two years — ammunition that the Cardinals can’t match.\n\nAs for Bain, he’s a powerful edge rusher who just notched three sacks against Texas A&M in the College Football Playoff. He could be the first defensive player off the board.\n\nUnlike the quarterback-needy teams around them, the Titans are in a great spot. Their top offseason priority will be finding talent to help support Cam Ward. And no matter where they end up, they should be able to draft either Tate or Jordyn Tyson, the top two wide receivers.\n\nSo, this is the Cardinals’ conundrum. Only two quarterbacks are currently seen as top-five picks, and one of them might stay in college.\n\nTrading up would be expensive, especially for a team that has holes all over its roster. Ty Simpson — the potential third quarterback off the board — would be a reach. There are few good options, unless their pick moves up over the next two weeks.\n\nAll of that could leave the Cardinals looking to another position. That’s where Fano comes in. He’s an athletic player who is widely considered the top tackle in the class. Pairing him with Paris Johnson Jr. would give the Cardinals their tackle duo of the future and boost an offensive line that has struggled in 2025.\n\nPurely from a talent perspective, Love might be the best player in this class. But as with Ashton Jeanty last year, the issue is positional value. Washington would be passing up on much-needed defensive help to draft Love.\n\nStill, the idea is tantalizing: a hyper-talented running back to pair with Jayden Daniels. That would give Washington one of the league’s most dangerous rushing attacks and reduce the need for Daniels to play hero ball, potentially helping him stay healthier.\n\nTyler Shough has been a pleasant late-season surprise, removing the Saints from the list of teams that need quarterback help. Drafting Tyson to pair with Chris Olave would suddenly create the potential for an exciting offense in New Orleans.\n\nWhile a homecoming with Tyson might be enticing for local fans — especially after missing out on Cam Skattebo last year — the fit doesn’t make much sense for the Cardinals. Wide receiver is one of their few positions of strength.\n\nIn many ways, Downs is the Jeremiyah Love of the defensive side — an elite talent at a non-premium position. The Bengals, though, need all the help they can get on defense, no matter where it comes. Downs would be a nice fit.\n\nSimpson is the wild card of this quarterback class. He could return to college, with only one year of starting experience under his belt. He could also slip to the back of the first round, due to both his lack of his experience and his struggles late in the season. Or teams could be wooed by his processing ability and early-season tape, shooting him up draft boards. All three options are on the table for now.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Early Arizona Cardinals 2026 NFL mock draft",

Oh, how times have changed.\n\nThe Chiefs are one of six teams playing on Christmas this season, as they cap the holiday by hosting the Denver Broncos, but the shoe is on the other foot this time.

McCarthy tries to prove he should enter 2026 as the team's starting quarterback.\n\nIn the nightcap, the Chiefs host the Broncos in a game that once looked like it might decide the AFC West but now only impacts the Broncos as they try to earn a first-round bye in the AFC.\n\nLive stream: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe first games of the Christmas Day tripleheader will be broadcast on Netflix, with the third and final contest airing on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nIan Eagle (play-by-play), Nate Burleson and Matt Ryan will be on the call from Northwest Stadium for Cowboys vs. Commanders, while Noah Eagle (play-by-play) will make it a family affair as he calls Lions vs. Vikings alongside Drew Brees.\n\nAl Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit will call Broncos vs. Chiefs in prime-time on their typical broadcast home of Amazon Prime Video.\n\nListen to the NFL's Christmas Day slate live with SiriusXM on channel 88, NFL Radio, for the national call.\n\nCorresponding channels for team-specific calls will be released in the days leading up to the Christmas tripleheader.\n\nNew subscribers get their first month of SiriusXM for free.

McCarthy (hand) out this week. pic.twitter.com/Dz1iknCZSL\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 23, 2025\n\nBefore this past Monday’s primetime game, the Colts waived Rypien, who had previously been signed to the active roster a week prior to serve as the QB3 against Seattle, in order to create a spot for activated veteran starting defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, coming off injured reserve.\n\nIt was a little bit surprising that the Colts didn’t elect to carry Rypien and declare him inactive—as a possibility as the emergency QB3 during Monday night’s loss. It’s not that there was a strong chance he would need to be called upon by any means, but a 44-year-old Philip Rivers is presumably at least a little less durable than the average NFL starter, and especially fresh off his couch and with five years of retirement.\n\nNot to mention, rookie Riley Leonard is just a few weeks removed from a knee injury, who has been serving as the Colts’ QB2 since Rivers’ surprising arrival.\n\nAt any rate, Rypien’s stint with the Colts ends without him appearing in an NFL game. The 29-year-old veteran quarterback was signed to the Indianapolis practice squad in mid-October before his signing and release.\n\nHe now reunites with the Vikings, his old squad that he spent last season with and this entire past offseason. However, he has yet to appear in an NFL game Minnesota either. In his 5-year career, he has appeared in 11 games, making 4 starts though.\n\nFor the Colts, Rypien was presumably a candidate to return to their practice squad—should he clear waivers. However, it appears as though he’ll be taking at least a brief pit stop in Minnesota until McCarthy returns.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDuring a key matchup between the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, DK Metcalf gave the NFL an incident to settle.\n\nThe Steelers' star receiver, in his first year with the team as it pursues the AFC North title, was seen swiping at a Lions fan in the stands as he stood on Pittsburgh's sideline at Ford Field.\n\nBecause officials didn't see the interaction, which was caught by the CBS broadcast, Metcalf wasn't disciplined in the game — but he was considered sure to be hearing from the NFL afterward. On Monday, the NFL announced a suspension for Metcalf that is set to heavily impact the Steelers' final playoff push.\n\nHere's what to know about Metcalf's suspension after the Steelers star was seen hitting a Lions fan in Week 16.\n\nWhat to know about DK Metcalf getting physical with a spectator\n\nMeet Ryan Kennedy, the fan that DK Metcalf threw a punch at during Lions-Steelers game\n\nOn Monday, Tom Pelissero reported that the NFL is suspending Metcalf for two games without pay for his physical confrontation with a Lions fan. Metcalf appeal that ruling, but on Tuesday, the two-game suspension was upheld, per Adam Schefter.\n\nThe NFL's statement on the suspension called it \"conduct detrimental to the NFL,\" saying that \"Metcalf's actions violate league policy, which specifies that 'players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day.\"\n\nFrom the NFL on DK Metcalf being suspended two games for his physical confrontation with a fan Sunday. pic.twitter.com/zopnwRAI0A\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) December 22, 2025\n\nSome level of punishment was expected for Metcalf after Sunday's incident.\n\nMetcalf was not disciplined by the officials for his interaction with a Lions fan on the sideline. However, that was because the referees did not see the interaction.\n\nHe appeared to be the one who initiated the physical contact with the fan, which means his situation is unlike that of Lamar Jackson's earlier in 2025, when the Baltimore Ravens quarterback pushed a Bills fan who had slapped his teammate's helmet. In that instance, the NFL did not punish Jackson, as the fan was banned from NFL stadiums and the matter was \"addressed by the club,\" per ESPN.\n\nWhen a player initiates the physical interaction with a fan, it's typically a different story for the league. Metcalf is now set to miss the Steelers' final two regular-season games; he will also be missing out on $277,777 per game check, per Jonathan Jones.\n\nMORE:What to know about the NFL's personal conduct policy\n\nMetcalf will be eligible to return to the Steelers roster on Monday, Jan. 5, after Week 18 is over.\n\nThat means he will miss Pittburgh's final two games of the regular season against the Browns and Ravens.\n\nHere's the moment Metcalf was seen hitting a Lions fan in Sunday's game.\n\nCBS reporter Tracy Wolfson said the fan said something to Metcalf before he swiped at him.\n\nPer ESPN, the Detroit Free Press spoke to the fan in the altercation, and he identified himself as Ryan Kennedy from Pinckney, Michigan. He said he called Metcalf by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.\n\n\"I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,\" Kennedy told the Free Press, per ESPN. \"I'm a little shocked.

Kennedy said that the incident occurred because he called Metcalf by his full name, and the Steelers receiver did not like that.\n\n\"He doesn’t like his government name. I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,\" Kennedy said. \"I’m a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me.

Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy last year when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and reported the fan to security.\n\nAfter some rumors over Kennedy using hateful language in the incident, the Lions fan released a statement denying that he used any racial or derogatory language to Metcalf in the interaction through his lawyer.\n\n\"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game.

    "fullText": "Who is the Lions fan that DK Metcalf punched? What to know about Ryan Kennedy and his history with Steelers WR originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Detroit Lions in Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season, but it wasn't without controversy.\n\nIn the first half, a clip went viral on social media of Pittsburgh wide receiver DK Metcalf appearing to punch a Lions fan in the stands. It was a quick clip, and no context was provided for the interaction at the time, but the video itself looked bad for the pass-catcher.\n\nMetcalf finished out the game because, by the current rule, the NFL can't intervene in a possible player disqualification unless there is a flag. Since the Steelers' offense wasn't even on the field, there were no flags, as the referees weren't even aware it had happened. He was, however, suspended two games by the league, a ruling that was then upheld after an appeal.\n\nWhile the public may never know exactly what happened to cause Metcalf to react that way, he may have a history with the fan.\n\nHere is more on the Lions fan that Metcalf punched in Week 16.\n\nMORE: DK Metcalf throws punch at fan during Lions-Steelers game\n\nThe Lions fan whom Metcalf punched is named Ryan Kennedy.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press was able to track him down after the game for his side of the story. He said he was \"a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me. I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n\nInitially, when asked his name, Kennedy said, \"My name is 'Biggest Detroit Lions Fan Ever that got attacked by DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.'\"\n\nAbout the incident, Kennedy said, \"He doesn’t like his government name. I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt. I’m a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me. I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n\nLions officials talked to him, and he was not thrown out of the game.\n\nMORE: Will DK Metcalf be suspended by NFL for punching fan?\n\nThe public may never officially know the truth behind what caused the incident. Kennedy told the Detroit Free Press after the game that he called the wide receiver by his legal name, causing the outburst.\n\nSources told NFL Network's Tom Pelissero that Kennedy and Metcalf have history. Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy last year when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and he reported the fan to stadium security.\n\nChad Ochocino said on a live stream appearance with Shannon Sharpe that sources told him that the fan called Metcalf a racial slur, and then made derogatory comments about the player's mother, but none of these claims have been confirmed.\n\nMetcalf's real name is DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, but he prefers to go by DK.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture in Week 16\n\nAfter the claims from Ochocinco that Kennedy used racial or derogatory language against Metcalf, the Lions fan, via his lawyer, released a statement denying that report.\n\nThe statement reads, \"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game. These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nGiven that the incident is now likely going to be a legal matter, Kennedy had no further comment at this time.\n\nRyan Kennedy, the fan involved in the DK Metcalf altercation Sunday, has issued a statement through an attorney “categorically denying using the “N-word,” the “C-word,” or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident.\n\n“These allegations are completely false.” pic.twitter.com/pQUbBYa0ww\n\n— Brooke Pryor (@bepryor) December 22, 2025\n\nHere is the initial clip that went viral on social media.\n\n#Steelers WR DK Metcalf upset with a fan… pic.twitter.com/eoZJjIiXHw\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 21, 2025\n\nHere is the clip released later from a different angle.\n\nAnother angle of the DK Metcalf incident with a #Lions fan during Sunday’s game:\n\n(via alexhamed3/IG, h/t @BussinWTB)pic.twitter.com/YTEjVwDZcohttps://t.co/d0lOJ9lu8e\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 22, 2025\n\nAnd a third look at the incident released the day after.\n\nAnother angle of the DK Metcalf incident with a Lions fan has been released....\n\n(via keiffer_kennedy/IG, h/t @premefootball)pic.twitter.com/CwXWQZqAuIhttps://t.co/Ej5KLXFtUz\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 22, 2025\n\nIt was reported the morning after the incident that Metcalf may actually have a history with Kennedy.\n\nAccording to Pelissero, Metcalf may have run into Kennedy at a Seahawks game last season, and the wide receiver may have reported him to stadium security.\n\nHow Travis Kelce's retirement decision is easy with no Patrick Mahomes\n\nPanthers take control of NFC South with massive win over Buccaneers\n\nMyles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record with obscure half sack\n\nGardner Minshew suffers potential ACL tear in first Chiefs game without Patrick Mahomes\n\nQuinshon Judkins out for season after gruesome leg injury vs. Bills",

    "title": "Shedeur Sanders has a role for Browns no matter what happens in 2026 NFL draft",
    "description": "Cleveland Browns QB Shedeur Sanders has shown development but the 2026 NFL draft could bring Dante Moore, Fernando Mendoza",
    "fullText": "In sports, in general, in 2025, there is no room for nuance. We know there is here at DBN in our comment section and in The Feed, but the general sports world speaks in certainties that really don’t exist and cliché sayings (both old and new) that lack detail.\n\nDuring the Cleveland Browns’ Week 16 game against the Buffalo Bills, I was reminded of a few of those certainties and clichés. For example, many have buried QB Shedeur Sanders as having no chance of being a top-level starter in the NFL, while others have looked at the exact same performances and seen enough to know for sure the Browns should build around their fifth-round quarterback.\n\nThe cliche “if it hits your hands, you should catch it” came up after Sanders’ first interception. In my analysis, Sanders’ throw was behind and thrown too hard for RB Quinshon Judkins to be able to haul it in easily. A great receiver may have been able to make the catch, but assuming Cleveland’s running back should have caught it was too far for what I saw. For others:\n\nEh make a play.\n\nThat definitely wasn’t too hard. Definitely was too behind…but also catch the ball.\n\n— Michael Keefe (@GarageBeersMike) December 21, 2025\n\nFor what it is worth, Michael Keefe is a friend of mine who understands football and has an amazing sports voice (literal voice); we just disagree here. I’ll forever argue in the nuance, especially when most others are only arguing on the extremes and in clichés.\n\nWhich brings us back to Sanders’ future:\n\n“Shedeur deserves more time to develop with a better OL and better weapons”.’\n\nAnd \n\n“You can’t pass on Mendoza or Moore in the Top 3 if one is there”\n\nCan both be true, IMO #DawgPound\n\n— CLEology (@_CLEology) December 22, 2025\n\nYes, Clay (another sports friend of mine), both can be true.\n\nJason Lloyd of The Athletic pointed out what the raw data has told us about both Dillon Gabriel and Sanders:\n\nGabriel has a higher Expected Points Added per dropback than Sanders — although that isn’t really saying much since Gabriel and Sanders have the two lowest figures in the league this season. Sanders has thrown for more yards and is averaging more yards per attempt, but Gabriel has a higher completion percentage, a higher passer rating and a higher touchdown-to-interception ratio.\n\nThe big difference, as you turn to the film that has led to that data, is that Sanders’ play looks like a rookie quarterback who is making big mistakes, but is also growing and developing. Whether it is the deep throws to Isaiah Bond, the feathered throws to Harold Fannin Jr., the successful scrambles at key moments, or his improved (still shaky) pocket presence, Sanders has shown that he could develop into a starter in the NFL…\n\n… but the Browns are going to have a top pick in the 2026 NFL draft to select a quarterback, Dante Moore or Fernando Mendoza, that they’ll likely have a much higher prospect grade on.\n\nIf Cleveland doesn’t have a high grade on Moore, Mendoza, or another quarterback, they would look to build around Sanders, even if they trade down to hedge their bets for a QB in the 2027 NFL draft. If the Browns didn’t have a pick where they could select one of the top quarterbacks (something Sanders could still impact in the last two weeks of the season), the team would continue to develop Sanders with an improved group of players around him and veteran QB Deshaun Watson supporting him as his backup.\n\nBarring a win or two, Cleveland will be selecting at the top of the upcoming draft and, most likely, picking a quarterback.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Sanders doesn’t have a role with the Browns. As is true with all rookie quarterbacks, I’m always in the “sit them until they are ready, plus a game or two” camp of development. Sanders could have all of training camp and the start of the 2026 NFL season to prove he is a capable starter in the NFL. Auditioning for Cleveland and every other team in the NFL while Moore, Mendoza, or whoever sits and waits.\n\nEven if Sanders is the backup, the young QB will have all of camp and preseason to audition for a starting job on other teams. This season has shown (with undrafted rookies starting in multiple places) the dire need for quality quarterback play around the league. If Sanders is able to show his development, even if designated as a backup, he’ll have a chance to start for another team in the very near future, and the team would get a quality return if their fifth-round pick proves he is a starting-caliber QB.\n\nThe Browns have gone decades with just one starting-level quarterback (Baker Mayfield) on their roster. In 2026, there could be two in Cleveland if the Browns select a quarterback high in this year’s draft and Sanders continues to develop. If that happens, whoever is in charge of the front office will have a difficult decision to make. A great problem to have.\n\nShedeur Sanders has shown signs that he could develop into a starting-level quarterback, and the Cleveland Browns are likely to draft a quarterback high in the 2026 NFL draft. Both are true, and Sanders’ role with the Browns will continue in 2026.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPhilip Rivers wife: Tiffany Rivers\n\nPhilip Rivers dad: Steve Rivers\n\nOne of the longtime quarterbacks to emerge from the 2000s in the NFL, Philip Rivers certainly lived up to his first-round price tag in the 2004 Draft.\n\nA member of the Los Angeles Chargers franchise for over a decade, including some time in San Diego, Rivers later spent time with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe gunslinger can be found all over NFL all-time passing leaderboards, a durable quarterback who consistently put up solid numbers on an annual basis. Rivers is also well-known for his large family with his wife, Tiffany.\n\nHere's what to know about Philip Rivers' family.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Philip Rivers' Hall of Fame case\n\nPhilip Rivers has 10 kids — seven daughters and three sons — with his wife, Tiffany Rivers. When the youngest child, Andrew Joseph Rivers, was born in November 2023, the oldest Rivers child, Halle Rivers, was 21 years old.\n\nMORE: Full Joe Flacco teams timeline\n\nYes, Philip Rivers is, in fact, a grandfather. His oldest daughter, who was born in 2002 — before he was drafted into the NFL in 2004— has a child.\n\nMORE: What is Justin Herbert's net worth?\n\nHere's what to know about the 10 children of Philip Rivers.\n\nOf Philip Rivers' 10 children, three are sons. The oldest of the bunch is Gunner Rivers, who was born in 2008. Gunner goes by his middle name — his first name is also Philip, like his dad.\n\n\"It's kind of crazy because we're wearing his jersey and sometimes people say 'Hi, Philip Rivers,' because I am wearing the jersey,\" Gunner said in 2019, per People. \"But they don't actually know that I'm actually Philip Rivers! Gunner is my middle name.\"\n\nGunner Rivers was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was five years old. His mother, Tiffany, told People in 2019 that she recalled Gunner \"starting to get really weak and tired,\" and his diagnosis was confirmed through a blood test. Since then, the family has helped him manage the condition.\n\n“What we’ve learned through our experience is that these kids are warriors,” Philip Rivers told PEOPLE. “We have seen firsthand the tremendous responsibility it is for these children to have the discipline to manage the disease with the support of family, and their health providers to live their best lives.”\n\nPhilip and Tiffany sold custom products through Tiffany's swimwear brand, Hermoza, to raise money for diabetes foundations in 2019.\n\nLike his father, Gunner became the starting quarterback at his high school, St. Michael Catholic in Alabama, as a freshman. Philip has coached the team led by his son, saying in 2023 that he doesn't have a desire to coach any higher than high school.\n\n“I think I would have gone right into it had that been what I wanted to do,” Philip Rivers told AL.com. “But, really, I’ve longed to coach my boys and these other 15-18 year-old boys since I was 25. I’m good right here.”\n\nPer AL.com, with Gunner as his starting quarterback, Philip Rivers led St. Michael Catholic to the playoffs in 2023 for the first time in school history. As of 2025, Gunner was a junior and beginning to eye college recruiting, with Philip Rivers telling AL.com that the family was keeping up with college football more because of it.\n\n247Sports has rated Gunner as a four-star quarterback prospect in the class of 2027, listing offers from Auburn, Miami, Boston College and more. And naturally, 247Sports scouting director Andrew Ivins compared Gunner's play style to his father's.\n\n\"Modern pocket passer with elite pedigree that wins with touch, timing and sound decision-making. Owns more of a unique shot put-like release, but makes it work, much like dad did many moons ago,\" Ivins wrote of Gunner Rivers. \"Projects at this stage as a high-end distributor with a rare set of intangibles that has a chance to be a difference-maker at the game’s highest level.\"\n\nAs for Peter Rivers, born in 2011, his father described him as an \"old soul\" to the Indianapolis Star in 2020. Peter also loves sports, his father said.\n\n“He kind of reminds me of a little slot receiver,” Philip Rivers said of Peter, per IndyStar. “Kind of like a Wes Welker.”\n\nThe youngest son is Andrew, who was born in October 2023. He was the Rivers' 10th child.\n\n“It’s awesome. Tiffany is awesome,” Philip Rivers told AL.com when Andrew was born. “It doesn’t matter if it’s the first child or the 10th child. It’s an awesome miracle every time. Everyone is home now, and everyone is good.”\n\nPhilip and Tiffany Rivers have seven daughters. The oldest is Halle, who was born in July 2002 — around two years before Philip reached the NFL, while he still was playing football at NC State. Tiffany also went to NC State.\n\nPer People, Halle previously said that she's used to the public interest that comes with having a quarterback father.\n\n\"He's been famous since before I was born,\" Halle said, per People. \"It's just been normal kind of my whole life. ... He's an NFL quarterback; he's doing a million different things every day, but every day he comes home, and he wants to be with us. If he has one extra minute that he could do something else, he'll be with us.\"\n\nIn 2020, Philip Rivers told the Indianapolis Star that Halle reminds him of his wife.\n\n“She reminds me, big-time, of her mom, which is a big compliment,” Rivers said, per the Indianapolis Star. “The biggest compliment I can probably give.”\n\nAs of 2025, Halle Rivers has a child of her own, making Philip and Tiffany grandparents. Philip announced in May 2025 that he had a new grandson.\n\nCaroline Rivers was the couple's second child, born in 2005, when Philip was beginning his Chargers career.\n\n“Caroline is very strong-willed, and I say that as a huge compliment,” Rivers said of Caroline in 2020. “She’s kind of a go-getter in that regard.”\n\nGrace Rivers, born in 2006, was nicknamed \"Combo\" by her parents at a young age, per the Indianapolis Star, for being like a blend of her mother and her father. She played both tennis and basketball.\n\n“She goes with the flow,” Philip Rivers said of Grace.\n\nBorn in 2010, Sarah Rivers was the couple's fourth daughter. Philip said in 2020 that Grace had gotten into swimming as she tried to find a sport she enjoyed.\n\n“Sarah’s got a big personality, loves to talk,” Philip Rivers said. “She is chatty, and I say that in a good way.”\n\nIn 2013, Philip and Tiffany welcomed their seventh child, Rebecca Rivers, and in 2015, Clare Rivers was their eighth child. Philip called Rebecca \"strong-willed\" to the Indianapolis Star in 2020; he also shared that Clare was born exactly two years after Rebecca, so they share a birthday.\n\n“They use the term they’re 'birthday sisters',” Philip Rivers said. “They enjoy having the same birthday right now. I don’t know if it will be the same when they’re 12 or 14.”\n\nAnna Rivers is the couple's youngest daughter. She was born in March 2019, with the Chargers' social media accounts announcing her birth.\n\nSHE'S HERE.\n\nWelcome to the world, Anna Rivers 👶 https://t.co/oafdNNI6lI\n\n— Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) March 26, 2019\n\nBefore Anna was born, Tiffany told WWD that the arrival of their seventh daughter would be a generational experience for the Rivers family.\n\n“This is the third generation in Philip’s family, who has seven girls and two boys so we were pretty excited about that,\" she said. \"When we told his 91-year-old grandfather, he said, ‘You didn’t have to go to the doctor to find that out. I could have told you — that’s family history.’ ”\n\nPhilip Rivers has one known grandson, as his oldest daughter, Halle, welcomed a son. In a video shared by Jon Gruden in May 2025, Philip shared that he had become a grandfather.\n\nMORE:Meet Justin Herbert's full family\n\nPhilip Rivers' wife is Tiffany Rivers. The two met in middle school in Alabama, then began dating in high school before attending North Carolina State University together then getting married in 2001 during their freshman year of college. Since then, Philip and Tiffany have welcomed 10 children.\n\nPhilip told The Chastity Project that he remembered first seeing Tiffany when he was young.\n\n“With Tiffany, I remember pointing her out at a ballgame at the ball field when I was young,” he said. “But I remember telling my mom, ‘Hey Mom, see that girl over there, she’s a good girl.’ And she was centered on faith and Christ. She had those values that I was looking for.”\n\nPhilip also said that while he grew up in the Catholic Church, his wife converted and became a Catholic the day before their wedding.\n\n“My wife had a lot to do with it, she’s a convert and she actually became Catholic the day before we got married,\" Philip told Life Teen, per The Christian Post. \"There’s so many gifts from the Faith to appreciate and it strikes people differently, but the one-ness of the Church wherever you are, Raleigh, San Diego, Alabama.

Quarterback Brock Purdy and tight end George Kittle went down with injuries in Week 1, causing each to miss time before the franchise returned to the Bay for its home opener.\n\nOther key players to miss time include wide receivers Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings, while star linebacker Fred Warner was carted off the field in Week 6.\n\nHere is a closer look at the 49ers' injuries, how the team has been impacted in comparison to other NFL franchises and a year-by-year timeline of absences to key players.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 18 greatest 49ers players ever\n\nThe 49ers have been one of the NFL's most injured teams for several years running.\n\nSan Francisco has been a top-10 most-injured team in six of seven seasons between 2018 and 2024, with the lone exception being the 2023 season.

WR Brandon Aiyuk and S Malik Mustapha both began the 2025 season on the PUP list with serious knee injuries, and they were joined on the sidelines by other key players along the way.\n\nQB Brock Purdy and TE George Kittle both sustained injuries in Week 1, with Purdy missing multiple games and Kittle being placed on IR. In Week 3, DE Nick Bosa suffered a season-ending torn ACL. Two key wide receivers, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall, also missed multiple games early in the season, and Pearsall's absences lingered into the final few weeks of the season.\n\nIn Week 6, veteran linebacker Fred Warner had to be carted off the field in an air cast in a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He will miss the remainder of the season with a broken and dislocated right ankle.\n\nIn the same week, after the loss, wide receiver Jauan Jennings told the media that he is playing with not only broken ribs, but also both high and low ankle sprains.\n\nIn Week 16, Kittle also exited with an ankle injury, not long after San Francisco had already secured a playoff berth.\n\nMORE:George Kittle plans to leave NFL for WWE when 'it hurts to put pants on in the morning'\n\nRB Christian McCaffery: 13 games missed\n\nWR Brandon Aiyuk: 10 games missed\n\nP Mitch Wishnowsky: 8 games missed\n\nOT Trent Williams: 6 games misssed\n\nRB Jordan Mason: 5 games missed\n\nRunning back Christian McCaffrey's Achilles injury was the cloud that loomed large over the 49ers' season in 2024.

Meanwhile, two of their biggest rivals, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets, are expected to be near the top of the draft order.\n\nBoth Miami and New York might be eyeing a rookie quarterback in the first round. Pro Football Focus’s Gordon McGuinness released a mock draft on Monday that had the Dolphins moving up from Pick No. 10 to No. 1 by trading with the New York Giants to secure Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.\n\n“Projected trade: New York Giants send No. 1 overall pick to Miami Dolphins for No. 10, No. 44, a 2027 first-round pick and a 2027 second-round pick,” McGuinness wrote.\n\n“With Tua Tagovailoa benched ahead of the Dolphins’ Week 16 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, it’s obvious that Miami is in the market for a new quarterback. In this mock draft, they get aggressive to move up for one.\n\n“Mendoza recorded a 6.2% big-time throw rate and a 2.3% turnover-worthy play rate this season, which compares well with recent No. 1 overall picks Cam Ward (6.3%, 3.3%) and Caleb Williams (6.2%, 3.6%).”\n\nThe Dolphins will likely be on the lookout for a replacement for Tagovailoa.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSince he entered the league in 2019, DK Metcalf has been known as one of the NFL's most productive wide receivers -- but also one of its most explosive personalities.\n\nFirst with the Seattle Seahawks, then with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Metcalf has earned a bit of a reputation for off-the-field antics, including the NFL having to discipline him. While Metcalf's dominance on the field has been a sight to behold at times, he's also been a distraction to his team at others.\n\nMetcalf has a long list of fines from the league for incidents ranging from fights and unnecessary roughness penalties, plus a 2025 suspension due to his physical interaction with a Detroit Lions fan.\n\nHere's a full timeline of Metcalf's off-the-field incidents since he entered the NFL.\n\nWhat to know about DK Metcalf getting physical with a spectator\n\nMeet Ryan Kennedy, the fan that DK Metcalf threw a punch at during Lions-Steelers game\n\nMetcalf has picked up 16 career fines from the NFL, per Spotrac, and the first came in December 2020.\n\nMetcalf, as part of a touchdown celebration, jumped into the stands — which were without fans during ongoing COVID-19 protocols — and took the broadcast camera from Fox's camera operator, moved it around a bit, then returned to the field.\n\nThe NFL then fined him $6,131 for that celebration.\n\nLmao DK Metcalf stealing the media camera and using it for his TD celebration. #Seahawkspic.twitter.com/I9mmXWevBi\n\n— Samuel Gold (@SamuelRGold) December 13, 2020\n\nIn a two-week span in October 2021, Metcalf was hit with a pair of NFL fines. First, after a matchup against the Saints, he earned a fine for unsportsmanlike conduct after a few scrums with cornerback Marshon Lattimore. Both players were fined for their roles in the incidents, seen shoving, grabbing at face masks and jawing at each other throughout the night.\n\nThen, on Halloween during the 2021 season, Metcalf was hit with a taunting fine in Week 8 after a Seahawks win over the Jaguars.\n\nMetcalf leaped up and hugged the goal post during a celebration, which he said was a reference to Antonio Brown previously doing the same, but the NFL wound up fining him $6,949 for the antics.\n\nHOW did @dkm14 make this catch 😱😱 😱\n\n📺: #JAXvsSEA on CBS pic.twitter.com/fQYMx6dVSY\n\n— x - Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) October 31, 2021\n\nMetcalf responded to his fine on social media, surprising at how much he was fined for a simple hug of the goal post.\n\nShiiii, Ain’t no hug worth that much bruh https://t.co/d16dwXb6vwpic.twitter.com/15FPHrRKy0\n\n— DeKaylin Metcalf (@dkm14) November 6, 2021\n\nThe 2021 season continued to be a busy one for Metcalf in Week 10, when his emotions boiled over during a 17-0 loss to the Packers. With less than two minutes remaining in the game, the receiver got into a fight with Packers safety Henry Black after grabbing Black's facemask during a scuffle.\n\nMetcalf was ejected for fighting, then also received a $6,949 fine.\n\n#Seahawks WR DK Metcalf has been ejected after this altercation with #Packers DB Henry Black.pic.twitter.com/Ry1jdhIOpd\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) November 15, 2021\n\nPlenty of NFL players debate with officials, pleading their case for the right call, but Metcalf seemed to have taken it too far in November 2022. In Week 10, he was flagged during the Seahawks' matchup against the Buccaneers after arguing an uncalled defensive pass interference penalty in the end zone.\n\nThe NFL proceeded to hit him with a $29,785 fine for arguing with an official, and while Metcalf appealed the fine, it was upheld. Per Adam Schefter, Metcalf was said to asked the official in the game if a play was pass interference, and the official was said to respond, “Did I throw a flag?”\n\nToward the end of the 2022 regular season, Metcalf received two fines from the NFL. The first came following Week 13 against the Rams, as Metcalf heat-butted opposing cornerback Jalen Ramsey and was called for unsportsmanlike conduct, then fined $10,609.\n\n“Yeah, I head-butted him on purpose,” Metcalf said, per the Seattle Times. “The official’s right there. [Ramsey] pushed me, so I head-butted him. It’s football.”\n\nThen, when the Seahawks and Rams met a few weeks later in January, Metcalf was fined another $21,219 for unsportsmanlike conduct in an exchange with Ramsey.\n\nMetcalf's troublemaking against the Rams continued into the 2023 season. In Week 1, Seattle took on L.A., and Metcalf had an ugly series where he blindsided safety Ahkello Witherspoon with a late hit to the ground, which wasn't part of the play.\n\nThat was then followed by a taunting penalty, meaning Metcalf received a pair of fines for a total of $21,854 from the NFL.\n\nFrustrations boiling over for the Seahawks right now 😬\npic.twitter.com/GvF7Kbkdqn\n\n— PFF (@PFF) September 10, 2023\n\nSeahawks head coach Pete Carroll later said Metcalf had to start to \"elevate above\" the antics, as his fines and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties were becoming a theme.\n\n\"DK and I talked for a long time last night about [how] that's not what we can allow to happen because that means that they can control him and get after him,\" Carroll said on his Seattle Sports 710-AM radio show, per ESPN. \"So, he has to elevate above that. So it's a challenge. This is nothing new. DK's been an emotional, feisty, fiery player since the day he got here, and that is who he is. But he has to also manage that so they don't take advantage of it.\"\n\nThe penalties continued for Metcalf in Weeks 2 and 3 of the 2023 season, as he was first flagged for a facemask on safety Kerby Joseph against the Lions, resulting in a fine of $10,927.\n\nThen, in Week 3, Metcalf was fined $16,391 by the NFL for an unnecessary roughness penalty against the Panthers, which resulted from him laying an illegal blindside block on a Carolina defender.\n\nWeek 6 of the 2023 season saw Metcalf get into a spat with Cincinnati Bengals DB Cam Taylor-Britt. The receiver shoved Taylor-Britt to the ground from behind after the whistle, and it resulted in a $16,391 fine for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nWhat a stupid play by DK Metcalf.

During the Steelers' matchup against the Detroit Lions, Metcalf was seen swiping at a Lions fan in the stands as he stood on Pittsburgh's sideline at Ford Field.\n\nOfficials did not see the interaction, so he was not penalized in the game, but CBS' broadcast caught Metcalf hitting the Lions fan.

Kennedy said he called Metcalf by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, which prompted the receiver's physical reaction.\n\n\"I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,\" Kennedy told the Free Press, per ESPN. \"I'm a little shocked. Like everyone's talking to me. I'm a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n\nNFL Network's Tom Pelissero also reported that Kennedy and Metcalf had a history, as Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy in 2024 when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and had previously reported the fan to security.\n\nAfter rumors over whether or not Kennedy used hateful language in the incident, the Lions fan released a statement denying that he used any racial or derogatory language to Metcalf in the interaction through his lawyer.\n\n\"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game. These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nRyan Kennedy, the fan involved in the DK Metcalf altercation Sunday, has issued a statement through an attorney “categorically denying using the “N-word,” the “C-word,” or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident.\n\n“These allegations are completely false.” pic.twitter.com/pQUbBYa0ww\n\n— Brooke Pryor (@bepryor) December 22, 2025\n\nMORE: Ranking the best players in Steelers history",

    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals will almost certainly, once again, be on the lookout for help in the defensive secondary.\n\nDon’t be surprised if the Bengals take yet another stab at finding a cornerstone cornerback in the draft after a number of misses in recent years.\n\nA recent mock draft from Sports Illustrated’s Daniel Flick has the Bengals tapping into Joe Burrow’s alma mater of LSU to grab cornerback Mansoor Delane.\n\nThe Bengals have the NFL’s worst defense, ranking last in total yards, scoring and rushing yards allowed and No. 29 in passing yards allowed. Delane is the draft’s best cornerback, and his elite instincts and route anticipation enable him to thrive in both man and zone coverages. The 6' 0\", 190-pound Delane has above-average ball skills, with two interceptions and 11 pass breakups this season, and is a physical, willing tackler in run support. He’s the complete package and should start as a rookie.\n\nDelane was a unanimous All-American and First-Team All-SEC in 2025. He recorded 45 tackles and two interceptions this season and just recently officially declared for the draft.\n\nThe Bengals have DJ Turner and Dax Hill as long-term options. But the Cam Taylor-Britt experiment is over and the search for higher-end prospects will start once again.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bengals Wire: Bengals won't make fans happy in top 10 NFL mock draft",

    "description": "At 8-6, the Colts are on the outside looking in at the playoff picture, but 44-year-old Philip Rivers coming in off the couch is one of the great stories of this NFL season.",
    "fullText": "Just think, for a moment, how you’d look in a pair of form-fitting football pants and a tight-around-the-belly jersey. Would you look like a honed specimen of humanity, lean and taut and ready to explode? Or would you look like 10 pounds of sausage in a five-pound casing, busting the seams?\n\nIf you’re being honest, you, me, and pretty much everyone both of us knows would look a whole lot more like a sausage than a specimen. A whole lot like Philip Rivers does, honestly.\n\nBut the difference between Philip Rivers and us, of course, is that we aren’t starting at quarterback on Monday Night Football.\n\nRivers and the briefly-mighty, now-floundering Indianapolis Colts take on the San Francisco 49ers in a matchup that, from a sheer talent standpoint, looked a whole lot more attractive back in September than it does now. Ball-knowers will scoff at Rivers and wonder who in the world would want to watch a 44-year-old grandfather run around for three hours.\n\nTo which I would say: Everyone. Everyone would love to see that. Because what Rivers is doing is both awesome and ridiculous.\n\nIn any other career, Rivers would be hitting his prime at age 44, old enough to have learned the ropes but young enough to have the energy and desire to do more. In sports, though, he’s impossibly ancient, a relic who could burst into a pile of dust with one good sack. Hopefully he won’t, but that’s the line on most aged pro athletes.\n\nPlayers like Tom Brady and LeBron James have redefined the possible parameters of a late-career athlete, but then again, Tom Brady and LeBron James are arguably the GOATs of their respective sports. They played for such a high level for so long that their age-related decline merely brought them down to star level.\n\nRivers wasn’t ever in that stratosphere, though he had a few years in the mid-2000s — you know, about two decades ago — when he garnered some Pro Bowl nods and MVP votes. He ran with all the speed of the changing seasons, yes, but he also possessed two valuable attributes — an orbital-launch arm and a surpassing knowledge of potential defensive schemes.\n\nThat’s how he was able to come back and mesh with the Colts so quickly last week against Seattle. He played within himself, tossing a nifty 18 of 27 completions for 160 yards, with a long of just 17 yards. He had an adjusted yards gained per pass attempt of 3.52 — quite the falloff from the 8- to 9-yard average of his best days. Against San Francisco, he could fare even better; the 49ers trail Seattle in every major defensive category.\n\nBut stats are for nerds. What Grandpa Rivers did last week was ball, plain and simple. And now he’s getting a chance to take Indy on a last-ditch playoff run? Come on, how can you not love this?\n\nAt 8-6, Indianapolis sits in the dreaded first-team-out spot, well behind 10-5 division rival Houston for the final spot in the AFC playoffs. After this week, the Colts have games against the Texans and Jaguars, both teams they’re staring up at in the playoff bracket. The Athletic gives Indianapolis just a 3 percent chance of making the playoffs, which is a rough prognosis given the Colts’ 7-1 start to 2025.\n\nThat’s tough news for the franchise and the city, but on a micro level, a great story is unfolding. Rivers is the embodiment of every former football player — whether high school, college or just two-hand touch Turkey Bowl — who would love to get one more turn in the arena, one more play with the ball in their hands, one more chance to rear back and throw it deep. He’s living the dream that if you keep in shape, if you keep your edge — if not your waistline — then maybe, just maybe, they’ll call your number one more time. Father Time is undefeated, yes, but you can always move the ball against him if you want it badly enough.\n\nRivers’ return is a hell of a story, however it ends. But it’d be nice if he went out with at least one more victory. Why not a prime-time one?",

    "description": "Week 16 reshaped the NFL playoff picture. Here is where things stand ahead of Colts-49ers",
    "fullText": "Week 16 saw several teams clinch playoff spots, and changed the pecking order in both the NFC and the AFC.\n\nIn the NFC, we have a new team in the No. 1 spot, and just two playoff spots left up for grabs as five teams have now clinched.\n\nIn the AFC, the race for the No. 1 spot remains tight, as six teams remain alive in the chase for the bye week.\n\nHere is the full state of play in the NFC ahead of Monday Night Football:\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (10-5) – xy\n\nWashington Commanders (4-11) – e\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ny – Team has clinched their division\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nThanks to Sunday’s action, only two playoff spots are left up for grabs in the NFC.\n\nLet’s start at the top of the conference. Seattle’s huge overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams not only punched the Seahawks’ ticket for the playoffs, but it put them in the driver’s seat for the No. 1 seed in the conference. Seattle now controls their destiny in the chase for the top spot, as wins in their final two games (over Carolina and San Francisco) would give them the No. 1 seed.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles became the first team to clinch their division, as they wrapped up the NFC East with their win over the Washington Commanders on Saturday night. Philadelphia also became the first team to win the NFC East in back-to-back seasons since … the Eagles accomplished that feat back in 2004.\n\nSpeaking of the Panthers, Carolina moved into a playoff spot with their win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. If the postseason began today the Panthers would be in as the No. 4 seed. Tampa Bay’s loss dropped them out of the playoffs, and behind the Minnesota Vikings in the standings. The two teams have matching 7-8 records, but the Vikings have a better conference record.\n\nTampa Bay can still win the division, however, as they play Carolina in Week 18.\n\nChicago’s win over the Packers moved the Bears one step closer to an NFC North title, while putting Green Bay’s playoff chances onto shakier ground. Still, with the Lions losing to the Steelers on Sunday afternoon, the Packers still have some breathing room.\n\nChicago also clinched a playoff spot with the Lions’ loss, as did the 49ers.\n\nHere is what the NFC Wild Card matchups woulkd look like if the playoffs started today:\n\nNo. 7 Green Bay at No. 2 Chicago\n\nNo 6 San Francisco at No. 3 Philadelphia\n\nNo. 5 Los Angeles at No. 4 Carolina\n\nSeattle would have the No. 1 seed and the bye week.\n\nHere is the state of play in the AFC:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nLet’s start at the bottom of the playoff teams. Houston’s win over the Raiders gives the Texans a two-game lead over Indianapolis in the win column, ahead of the Colts’ game tonight against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers and the Buffalo Bills have matching 11-4 records, but the Chargers have a better AFC record (8-2 vs. 8-3) than the Bills, so the Chargers slot into the No. 5 slot while the Bills settle for No. 6. Los Angeles has two more AFC games remaining (Houston and Denver) while the Bills just have the Jets remaining on their list of AFC opponents.\n\nDenver’s loss to Jacksonville, coupled with New England’s win over the Baltimore Ravens, tightened things at the top of the AFC as both teams have matching 12-3 records. The Broncos remain in the top spot due to a better record in common games (6-0 versus 4-1), and Denver has clinched that tiebreaker. However, in addition to the Patriots and Broncos, the Jaguars, Chargers, Bills, and Texans are all alive in the chase for the No. 1 pick.\n\nHere is what the AFC playoffs would look like if they began today, with Denver having the bye week:\n\nNo. 7 Houston at No. 2 New England\n\nNo. 6 Buffalo at No. 3 Jacksonville\n\nNo. 5 Los Angeles at No. 4 Pittsburgh\n\nThere are going to be some new fans around the league rooting for the 49ers tonight.\n\nFirst, let’s start with what this game means for the teams playing on Monday Night Football. The 49ers clinched a playoff spot when the Lions lost to the Steelers, and are now jockeying for position in the NFC pecking order. If the 49ers defeat the Colts, they will improve to 11-4, tying them with the Los Angeles Rams. But the 49ers would move into the No. 5 spot and drop the Rams down to the No. 6 spot, thanks to San Francisco’s better division record. San Francisco is 4-1 in NFC West games, while the Rams are 3-2.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Seahawks are 3-2 in NFC West games as well, and they play San Francisco in Week 18 having already lost to the 49ers back in Week 1.\n\nIf the 49ers lose, they will remain in the No. 6 slot.\n\nAs for the Colts, they enter Monday Night Football on the outside looking in. A win would not move Indianapolis into a playoff spot, but they would close to within one game of the Texans for the No. 7 spot.\n\nBut if the Colts lose, they will be eliminated from AFC South title contention, and they would drop two games behind the Texans in the race for a playoff spot with two games remaining.\n\nIn addition, if the Colts lose, the Chargers, Bills, and Jaguars all clinch playoff spots.",

    "description": "A look at the NFC playoff picture and the Detroit Lions’ dwindling postseason odds and clinching scenarios.",
    "fullText": "With a devastating loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions have dropped to 8-7 on the season, and their playoff hopes are about as realistic as Calvin Johnson coming out of retirement. Here’s a look at what the playoff picture looks like, the Lions’ remaining playoff scenarios, and where the rest of the division and conference looks like.\n\nThe Lions can no longer win the NFC North, and the Bears are just a single win away from clinching their first division title since 2018. It’s a tough pill to swallow for Lions fans, as it appears Ben Johnson was the perfect hire for the Bears.\n\nThe Lions are actually in danger of falling into fourth place in the NFC North, and a loss to the Vikings on Christmas would nearly seal it. Both teams would be 8-8, the Vikings would finish with a season sweep of the Lions, and Detroit would finish the season with a tough matchup against a Bears team that may be still looking to clinch the division.\n\nOf course, maybe it would be a blessing in disguise for the Lions to finish last in the division so that they could play a fourth-place schedule next year (which would like feature games against the Giants, Titans, and Cardinals).\n\nWild Card race (top three advance)\n\nThe Lions’ best potential record is 10-7, meaning they can only mathematically catch the 49ers and Packers. But because the 49ers have locked in the tiebreaker over the Lions due to their conference record (8-2 vs. 5-5), the Packers are the only team Detroit can actually catch.\n\nObviously that would require the Lions to win both of their remaining games (at Vikings, at Bears), but the Packers would also have to lose out. Green Bay has the 7-8 Baltimore Ravens this upcoming week, who lost Lamar Jackson to a back injury on Sunday night. And they finish out with the Vikings, who lost J.J. McCarthy to a throwing hand injury on Sunday. Even though the Packers are struggling and have a bunch of injuries of their own, that seems very unlikely to happen.\n\nThe New York Times only gives the Lions a 6% chance to make the playoffs. NextGenStats has Detroit at 8%.",

Obviously, he missed last season with the injury, but it's kind of his first go-around,\" said Rollins, \"Which Lions are we going to get? Lions from last year that dominated and maybe made an early playoff exit, or are we going to get a Lions team that misses the playoffs this season? It's going to be very interesting to see.

The Browns moved up to the third spot after the early Week 16 games on Sunday, but saw the Las Vegas Raiders fail to knock off the Houston Texans in a very close game that would have helped Cleveland move up even further.\n\nThe Browns close loss to the Buffalo Bills was made much worse by the significant injuries to RB Quinshon Judkins. While there was a positive estimate after the game, Cleveland fans await confirmation on whether Judkins’ ligaments are intact.\n\nWith just one game left in Week 16, the Browns remain locked into the third spot in the 2026 NFL draft order, with the pick they acquired from the Jacksonville Jaguars likely awaiting the results in the NFL playoffs.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (via Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (via Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (via Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (via Jacksonville Jaguars)\n\nThe Giants and Raiders play each other next week, with Las Vegas also set to play the (zombie) Chiefs in Week 18. The Browns seem destined to pick in the top two in the 2026 NFL draft at this point, as long as they lose their final two games.",

It’s been a great experience here today and I don’t know what the future holds for me, but it was a special day for me and my family.”\n\n.@T_Hill4 on the past 9 years in New Orleans and what this city means to him pic.twitter.com/xSyUa2O99c\n\n— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) December 21, 2025\n\nHill restructured his contract last offseason, and there are no contractual ties to keep him in New Orleans beyond 2025. He started the year on the PUP list after having his 2024 campaign cut short by a significant knee injury that included a torn ACL, and it makes sense for a rebuilding Saints team to move in another direction.\n\n“I can tell you, I have so much love for the city of New Orleans and this fan base and the way that they’ve embraced me and my family,” Hill said.\n\n“It’s been really special. I wouldn’t want to play somewhere else, but there’s a lot of circumstances that are out of your control and I understand the nature of this business. I’m not thinking that way right now, but we’ll tackle that when we get there.”\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it.”\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Kellen Moore\n\nNew Orleans first-year coach Kellen Moore, who is Hill’s third head coach in his time with the Saints, shared what Hill has meant to the franchise.\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it,” Moore said. “His ability to play every phase of the offense and contribute on special teams is really special.\n\n“He’s an A-plus person, an A-plus human being and an A-plus player. Our young guys can learn a lot from him.”\n\n#Saints HC Kellen Moore on Taysom Hill:\n\n\"This league talks about trying to get Taysom Hills on your football team ... no one seems to be able to duplicate it.\" pic.twitter.com/JtZkkQWbVr\n\n— NOF (@nofnetwork) December 21, 2025\n\nIn Sunday’s game, Hill delivered an effort that was vintage Swiss Army Knife.\n\nHe led New Orleans in rushing, made plays from his tight end position and even threw a touchdown with under two minutes to play.\n\nThat score was something the Saints acknowledged they were trying to get for Hill, in case he doesn’t return.\n\nWhen he heard the team was trying to get Hill a touchdown, Olave made sure he was on the field at a point in the game when he didn’t need to be in the contest risking injury.\n\n“Definitely wanted to be a part of that, especially knowing they wanted to get Taysom a touchdown, so I wanted to be a part of that — a deep ball, too — so I definitely wanted to be in there,” Olave said.",

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Seahawks edge Patriots for new No. 1; Jaguars, Bears also rise; Packers fade for Week 17 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRanking all 32 teams in the NFL from best to worst for every week in the 2025 regular season has been a wild ride. With such a top-heavy league, the hierarchy can see a big change based on a few particular results.\n\nThat has often caused teams to jump high or fade fast in relation to the others near the top. Even the back end has seen some significant reshuffling of late.\n\nHere's Sporting News' latest breakdown from the tippy top to rock bottom coming out of Week 16:\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture after Week 16 results\n\nThe Seahawks won that thriller over the Rams with the offense rebounding after a slow passing start. They need Sam Darnold to cut down on the mistakes and keep raising the big plays to live up to their lofty playoff position.\n\nThe Patriots went into more of an offensive slump in Baltimore with Drake Maye cooling and being contained again, putting their chances of stealing the AFC East in serious jeopardy.\n\nMORE: Patriots clinch playoff spot for first time since 2021\n\nThe Rams had no problems moving the ball without Davante Adams with Matthew Stafford spreading the ball around and getting more from the running game. But the secondary issues in Seattle became more prevalent when the front cannot get pressure.\n\nThe Broncos couldn't find enough clean offense from Bo Nix to make another fourth-quarter comeback in what looked more like a blowout loss to the Jaguars. Their defense, having key lapses, is a shaky late development.\n\nThe Jaguars had their true statement victory in Denver, making six straight wins. Their road domination and finishing well in the fourth quarter bodes well for their playoff profile.\n\nMORE: 6 reasons why Jaguars are legitimate Super Bowl contenders\n\nThe Bears should be thrilled to have the late-game comeback mode of Caleb Williams, always giving them a chance. Chicago is pushing toward being a tough out in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: Bears take control of NFC North with win over Packers\n\nThe Bills were caught in a tough battle down the road in Cleveland as Josh Allen's clunker against a tough defense was saved by James Cook and the running game. The defense was fortunate to face a team with limited weapons to survive\n\nThe Chargers went into Dallas and used it for a get-well offensive game with more juice from their defense, too. Justin Herbert needed that and so did Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe 49ers should have loved the fact that the Seahawks took down the Rams on Thursday night. Their offense is red-hot and a win over the Colts would give them control of the division in the final two weeks.\n\nThe Eagles have got their offensive groove back with Saquon Barkley running well and Jalen Hurts' passing efficiently everywhere to silence the critics. They don't need to worry about the division anymore and can focus on getting into top shape for their Super Bowl defense in the playoffs.\n\nThe Packers saw Jordan Love get concussed in Chicago with Malik Willis playing well enough to win, but had too many offensive, defensive and special teams lapses to create a bigger mess than injuries.\n\nThe Texans were able to hold off the Raiders with resilient offense and just enough of their trademark defense. The hiccup is excusable with a win, but much must be fixed before facing the Chargers next week.\n\nMORE: Texans keep playoff hopes alive by escaping with win over Raiders\n\nThe Steelers found their running game again in Detroit to balance out the stellar run defense. They keep getting better at the right time to get into the playoffs on an uptick with Aaron Rodgers.\n\nThe Lions have been struggling to run the ball at will like they did last season and taking that element away, as the Steelers did. That and an injury-depleted defense have been the downfall for Detroit as a playoff contender.\n\nThe Panthers showed a lot of moxie in outlasting the Buccaneers with Bryce Young winning the biggest passing duel of his career. They have a great shot at making some noise should they get into the NFC playoffs.\n\nMORE: Panthers take control of NFC South with massive win over Buccaneers\n\nThe Colts will try to do more with a game Philip Rivers on Monday night against the 49ers with their season on the line, but the defense also may not oblige in a tough spot.\n\nThe Ravens had another defensive meltdown and other fourth-quarter big mistakes to blow another big lead, this time vs. the Patriots, spelling doom for a bad overall season, now maybe with Lamar Jackson not finishing healthy.\n\nMORE: Ravens' path to the postseason gets bleaker with loss to Patriots\n\nThe Buccaneers are making too many mistakes late in games, from the defense to Baker Mayfield. They can still get into the playoffs but there will be less inspiration for them to last long against a tough wild-card draw.\n\nThe Vikings can't seem to keep J.J. McCarthy healthy right when he builds positive momentum, but they still grounded out another win with enough clutch plays and more needed tough defense against what was a promising Giants offense.\n\nThe Cowboys look like they're running out of gas offensively to keep trying to make up for historically horrible all-around defense. This disappointment can't be blamed on Dak Prescott.\n\nThe Falcons are working to finish strong with wins over the Buccaneers and Cardinals making them feel better about the future of Raheem Morris as head coach. Credit Morris for getting them to be inspired with nothing left on the line.\n\nThe Chiefs can't be expected to win with their defense not having a pass rush and their offense not having a passing game minus Patrick Mahomes, Gardner Minshew and their top wide receiver. The fact they lost so easily on the road to the Titans is just so shocking.\n\nMORE: How Travis Kelce's retirement decision is easy with no Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe Saints took care of the lesser Jets at home with Tyler Shough chucking well with help from diverse weapons under Kellen Moore. He should go into Year 2 as the starting QB and the defense is also playing with a lot of late conviction.\n\nThe Bengals showed almost no life in Week 15 against the Ravens but got up off the mat to rip an overmatched and lesser-motivated Dolphins team with Joe Burrow needing that get-well performance late to try to end the season on a positive.\n\nThe Dolphins have faded fast from their rally back into playoff contention with dismal performances against the Steelers and Bengals in consecutive losses. Mike McDaniel can feel the heat again with the Tua Tagovailoa benching backfiring.\n\nThe Commanders just haven't fielded enough reliable defense all season long, with their age and youth showing in all the wrong places. They will just hope everything will change again with a healthy Jayden Daniels leading the offense.\n\nThe Titans are seeing a much-improved Cam Ward in recent weeks and it added up to a nice confidence-building win against the reeling Chiefs at home.\n\nThe Browns fought hard against the Bills with Shedeur Sanders showing the kind of fight and play that gets him a full-season audition as the starter in 2026 despite the defense falling apart around Myles Garrett.\n\nMORE: Myles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record with obscure half sack\n\nThe Cardinals' positive offensive vibes have hit a wall with Jacoby Brissett and the rest of their backups, who have had too much pressure to compensate for a Jonathan Gannon potential lame-duck defense.\n\nThe Jets did their best to stay competitive with Brady Cook starting again at quarterback but the bigger problem is Aaron Glenn's shell of an overall defense. They are a really lost, bad team.\n\nMORE: Updated NFL draft order after Week 16\n\nJaxson Dart was due for a clunker and the Vikings' defense delivered it to him. The lumps have been there enough to go forward with a new coaching system all-around.\n\nThe Raiders showed more life with their offense in of all places, Houston against the Texans' nasty defense. They also played their most inspired defensive game in weeks. It still wasn't enough to overcome their lack of execution.",

    "title": "Patriots game day roster: NFL Week 16 vs. Ravens",
    "description": "A look at the Patriots’ game day roster for their Week 16 game on Sunday night.",
    "fullText": "With Robert Spillane sidelined throughout the game, the New England Patriots’ linebacker group had a disappointing outing last week versus the Buffalo Bills. The challenge will not be any easier for the position on Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nNot only will Spillane miss a second straight game because of an ankle injury, the Ravens feature one of the best run games in the NFL. Led by the two-headed monster of quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry, they are entering Sunday as the league leaders in yards per carry (5.2).\n\nWith Spillane out, that means the task on stopping this potent an attack will fall on replacement starting duo Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. As head coach Mike Vrabel pointed out on Friday, however, they will not be the only one in the spotlight.\n\n“Everybody that goes to the game is going to play and have a role, and we ask everybody to prepare as starters,” Vrabel explained. “That’s something that’s important. And so, Gibby will start in there, and then different guys will play, packages and everything else.”\n\nNew England’s full game day roster against the Ravens looks as follows:\n\nQuarterback (2): Drake Maye (10), Joshua Dobbs (11)\n\nRunning back (4): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), D’Ernest Johnson (34), Jack Westover (37 | FB/TE)\n\nWide receiver (5): Kayshon Boutte (9), Stefon Diggs (8), Mack Hollins (13), DeMario Douglas (3), Kyle Williams (18 | KR)\n\nTight end (2): Hunter Henry (85), Austin Hooper (81)\n\nOffensive tackle (3): Vederian Lowe (59 | LT), Morgan Moses (76 | RT), Thayer Munford Jr. (74)\n\nInterior offensive line (5): Jared Wilson (58 | LG), Garrett Bradbury (65 | C), Mike Onwenu (71 | RG), Ben Brown (77), Caedan Wallace (70)\n\nInterior defensive line (5): Christian Barmore (90), Khyiris Tonga (95 | FB), Cory Durden (94), Eric Gregory (55), Joshua Farmer (92)\n\nDefensive edge (5): Harold Landry III (2), K’Lavon Chaisson (44), Elijah Ponder (91), Anfernee Jennings (33), Bradyn Swinson (43)\n\nLinebacker (5): Jack Gibbens (51), Christian Elliss (53), Jahlani Tavai (48), Marte Mapu (15), Chad Muma (49)\n\nCornerback (5): Christian Gonzalez (0), Carlton Davis III (7), Marcus Jones (25 | PR), Charles Woods (22), Miles Battle (35)\n\nSafety (4): Jaylinn Hawkins (21), Craig Woodson (31), Dell Pettus (24), Brenden Schooler (41)\n\nSpecialists (3): Andy Borregales (36 | K), Bryce Baringer (17 | P/H), Julian Ashby (47 | LS)\n\nThe Patriots’ front seven is seeing some changes compared to last week. Not only is Chad Muma active as extra depth at linebacker and on special teams just five days after getting claimed off waivers from the Indianapolis Colts, two recent inactives are also up this week: Eric Gregory will provide additional depth at defensive tackle, while Bradyn Swinson should help on the edge.\n\nSwinson’s presence on the game day roster comes in light of starter Harold Landry being questionable with a knee injury. The fifth-round rookie has appeared in one game so far, playing 10 snaps in the kicking game but none on defense.\n\nInactives (5): QB3 Tommy DeVito (16), WR Efton Chism III (86), TE C.J. Dippre (82), OT Marcus Bryant (52), LB Robert Spillane (14)\n\nPractice squad (16): RB Jashaun Corbin (30), WR John Jiles (83), WR Jeremiah Webb (29), OL Sebastian Gutierrez (72), OL Andrew Rupcich (67), OL Brenden Jaimes (61), OL Mehki Butler (63), DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (98), DT Leonard Taylor III (93), DT Fabien Lovett Sr. (96), LB Amari Gainer (45), LB Otis Reese (54), CB Brandon Crossley (46), CB Kobee Minor (19), S Richie Grant (39), S John Saunders Jr. (23)\n\nPractice squad/exempt (1): TE Thomas Odukoya (88 | IPPP)\n\nPractice squad/injured (2): RB Craig Reynolds, LB Darius Harris\n\nReserve/injured (11): FB Brock Lampe, OT Yasir Durant, CB Marcellas Dial Jr., DT Jaquelin Roy, RB Lan Larison, RB Deneric Prince, DT Isaiah Iton, RB Antonio Gibson, DT Milton Williams, CB Alex Austin, OT Will Campbell, RB Terrell Jennings\n\nReserve/retired (1): OL Wes Schweitzer\n\nWith no players elevated from the practice squad, a total of five players were ruled out on Sunday. The list includes no surprises, with Spillane, who was deemed inactive ahead of the weekend already, as the only noteworthy absence.\n\nThe Patriots’ game against the Ravens will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.",

    "fullText": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers rookie safety Lathan Ransom has experienced the dramatic highs and lows of playing in the NFL in his first season.\n\nOne week after a crucial penalty that led to a costly loss to the New Orleans Saints, Ransom redeemed himself on Sunday by intercepting Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left to seal the Panthers' 23-20 win over the Buccaneers — allowing Carolina to vault into sole possession of first place in the NFC South.\n\n“I faced a lot of adversity, and I heard noise from everybody last week,” Ransom said. “... (But) that’s how you shake back.”\n\nRansom couldn't have felt much worse last week on the flight home from New Orleans after he was flagged for hitting sliding Saints quarterback Tyler Shough with 9 seconds left on a bang-bang play. Officials flagged Ransom for unnecessary roughness, and the 15-yard penalty turned a difficult 61-yard field goal attempt into a far more makable one from 46 yards.\n\nCharlie Smyth put it through the uprights to complete the Saints' 20-17 come-from-behind win.\n\nHad the Panthers defeated the Saints, they would have only needed to beat the Bucs on Sunday to clinch the NFC South and end a seven-year playoff drought. Instead, the loss left the Panthers on the outside of the playoff bubble.\n\nRansom said he was hard on himself.\n\nBut the fourth-draft pick from Ohio State decided early last week that instead of dwelling on the mistake he'd use it as motivation.\n\n“I understand that the game is not won or lost by one play, but people behind their phone are going to have their own opinions,” Ransom said. “I just heard all the noise — listened to it and used it as fuel for this game.”\n\nRansom leaned on the support last week of veteran defensive leaders such as Jaycee Horn, Derrick Brown and Mike Jackson, who shares the locker next to him.\n\nJackson and others advised to look ahead, not back and keeping playing at full speed.\n\n“He responded like a grown man should,\" Jackson said. “At the end of day, everyone was talking trash to him, like he shouldn't be in the game and this and that. And today he responded like he should be. I'll just say I'm proud of him. Because at the end of the day it's grown man football and he showed that.”\n\nPanthers coach Dave Canales greeted Ransom on the sideline with a huge hug after interception, and smiled as he spoke about the rookie after the game.\n\n“That’s a great story,” Canales said. “That’s fantastic and it’s just about belief and having confidence in our guys to be able to be studs about the things we need to work on and be studs about the different decisions that come up. I love that for Lathan — for him to be able to make the winning play, the biggest play of the game for us.”\n\nThe Panthers will need more big plays from Ransom and other young players if they hope to dethrone the Buccaneers, who have won the last four NFC South titles.\n\nCarolina can clinch the division with a win next week against Seattle and a Tampa Bay loss to Miami. But if the Bucs win, it will come down to a rematch in Week 18 for the division title.\n\n“I’ve learned a bunch throughout the season, especially from that first game,” Ransom said. “You’re going to learn. It’s a learning process. You’re playing with the best of the best. I learn more and more every game and I try to take those teachings into the next game.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "The Texans face the Raiders in Houston on Sunday. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 16.",
    "fullText": "Game result: The Texans beat the Raiders, 23-21, in Week 16. Houston improves to 10-5 on the year and stays at the No. 7 seed in the AFC Playoff picture. Houston remains a game behind the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC South, who moved to 11-4 with their win over the Denver Broncos on Week 16.\n\nThe Houston Texans are closing in on a playoff berth, but it will be at least another week before they will have a clinching scenario. The Texans host the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 16 and this is a game they absolutely cannot lose.\n\nThe Texans are 9-5 and have won six straight in a streak that has included wins over the Jaguars, Bills, Colts, and Chiefs. They beat the Cardinals 40-20 last week. The Texans face a Raiders squad that is 2-12 and has lost eight straight games. Last week, the Raiders were thumped by the Eagles 31-0 in Philly.\n\nHouston is a 14.5-point favorite, which is the biggest spread of Week 16.\n\nThe Texans are in second place in the division sitting one game back of the Jaguars. Houston and Jacksonville split their season series and the Texans have a half game lead for the divisional tiebreaker (4-1 vs. 3-1). The Jaguars are traveling to face the Broncos this weekend, so if they lose that but win their two remaining games, the tiebreaker would go to record in common games.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colts sit a game back of the Texans and still has one game left with them. Houston won the first game in Week 13. The Colts need to see the Texans lose in Week 16 or 17 to create a situation in which the Colts can finish ahead of them.\n\nThe Texans are in seventh place and hold the final wild card spot ahead of the 8-6 Colts and 7-7 Ravens. If the Texans win and the Colts lose, Houston would have a wild card clinching scenario in Week 17 when they travel to face the Chargers. The Texans enter Week 16 with a 98% chance of making the playoffs at The Athletic’s playoff simulator. Houston has a 58% chance of claiming a wild card berth and a 40% chance of winning the division.\n\nThe Raiders are a common opponent for the Texans and Jaguars. There is a very real chance the Texans and Jaguars finish tied and it common opponents. They are also a common opponent with the Chargers, but Houston and LA will have a head-to-head tiebreaker sorted out when they meet in Week 17.",
