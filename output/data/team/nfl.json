    "title": "Can a nepo baby be an underdog? The remarkable rise of Shedeur Sanders",
    "description": "The quarterback was seen as living off his father’s name when he entered the NFL. But he has slowly started to prove himself at the Cleveland Browns",
    "fullText": "It seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, the Cleveland Browns’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.\n\nHe excelled at two colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most dramatic stock crashes in league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.\n\nEarlier this week Sanders was named the Browns starter for the rest of the season, inviting even more scrutiny of a an already polarizing player. His supporters say Sanders is entitled to his shot; his critics say he lacks the skills to play in the NFL, question his attitude and paint him as a spoiled rich kid. Every argument seems to excavate deeper feelings about Deion Sanders, his Prime Time father who paved the way for his son’s success. In the age of the nepo baby, Shedeur makes for a strange underdog story.\n\nThere are expectations that come with being a starting quarterback in the NFL, after all. In addition to the requisite physical attributes and arm talent, the cliche dictates that quarterbacks are men of character – players who speak in the first person plural, deflect credit, absorb blame and lead with modesty. It’s how the quarterback position became shorthand for a standard of American leadership that was largely reserved for conservative white men until recently. But Shedeur doesn’t even resemble the Black quarterbacks who have in the last few years broken from that tradition and transformed the league. Instead, in character at least, he resembles his father. Deion is a flashy, brash and supremely self-confident two-sport superstar universally recognized as one of the best players in NFL history.\n\nAfter becoming the first Browns quarterback to win his first start since the team’s 1999 relaunch, a soundbite of Shedeur effectively congratulating himself for playing well despite his limited practice time overshadowed the more diplomatic remarks he’d make in praise of the team later. (“Imagine what a full offseason looks like,” he beamed. “It gets dangerous!”) When he was asked last Sunday if a botched two-point conversion attempt had worked during practice, he laughed. (“I don’t think you call plays in a game that didn’t work in practice,” he cracked.) After being criticized for his remarks in the media earlier this season, he was asked about the Browns’ quarterback situation. Sanders repeatedly answered by grinning and then silently moving his mouth in response – which had fans jokingly referring to him as Mime Time in a nod to his father.\n\n“We want our quarterbacks to be very, very humble,” says Louis Moore, the Michigan State history professor and author of The Great Black Hope: Doug Williams, Vince Evans, and the Making of the Black Quarterback. “He’s not that. He’s grown up believing that he’s allowed to have confidence in himself. The world beats down a lot of young Black kids, and Deion never let it happen.”\n\nThe biased nature of the scrutiny on Shedeur, especially when things don’t go his way, often results in fans bringing up racism. They further wonder whether Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski holds a grudge against the Sanders family because his father-in-law, Tim McCarver, had an infamous run-in with Deion during the latter’s baseball career.\n\nBut the issue isn’t quite so black and white. Somehow, the Sanders family manage to inspire Obama-level respect and enthusiasm among Black Americans (who helped make Shedeur’s Browns jersey a bestseller) while also having Donald Trump in their corner. The current president hasn’t hesitated to cannonball into the Shedeur Sanders discourse, calling NFL owners “stupid” for letting him fall in the draft and trumpeting “I TOLD YOU SO!” on social media after Shedeur led the Browns past the Raiders. Trump couldn’t let those moments pass without making some mention of Shedeur’s “exceptional genes” in what was otherwise a forceful show of support.\n\n“I’m just thankful for [Trump] even taking time out of his day to speak out,” said Shedeur, reveling in his nepo baby status. While Peyton Manning was determined to overshadow his father Archie’s fruitless years with the New Orleans Saints and Bronny James shrinks from the allusions to the more prominent Lakers player in his family, Shedeur has been happy to share a spotlight with his famous father for more than a decade.\n\nA good chunk of his adolescence was documented on Deion’s Family Playbook, a reality TV series that ran on Oprah’s cable channel. Shedeur then played under his father when Deion coached at Mississippi’s Jackson State University and the University of Colorado, and the pair were instrumental in reviving both of those programs. Wherever Shedeur goes, there’s usually a camera following him – and oftentimes his older brother Deion Sanders Jr, the architect of the family’s vast online media presence, is the one holding the camera. Around family, Shedeur reverts from a football star to a little brother who gets razzed about his fashion choices and his position on his father’s sibling power rankings.\n\nBeing Deion Sanders’s son made Shedeur savvy to how NFL storylines are shaped, and the one he’s crafted about himself strikes the media – who are used to taking charge of the narrative – as presumptuous. He calls himself “legendary”, shrugs off brickbats (“You think I’m worried about what critics say?”) and throws words like “destiny” around when projecting his career path. Resentments linger about his starry approach to the draft process that may well have cost him the chance to be picked higher. It was thought that Deion was the one quarterbacking things behind the scenes at this year’s draft, but he has since revealed that it was Shedeur who may have rebuffed higher draft opportunities in Philadelphia and Baltimore because he didn’t want to sit behind two established starters, Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson – a pretty smart read as it turns out.\n\n“I know the fight behind the fight,” Deion Sanders said earlier this season. “I know what’s been transpiring behind the curtains, and I’m just proud of him. Because he’s not just saying the right things, he’s doing and living the right things. That’s just who he is … He’s a Sanders.”\n\nShedeur has only played in four NFL games, two of those against bad teams, which is too small a sample size to make concrete pronouncements about his career. But his performances so far for the Browns, a team who have sunk the careers of countless quarterbacks, hint that he is dramatically better than his lowly draft position suggests. And while his chance to finish out the season is the first true vote of confidence he has received since joining the organization, there’s a sense that he isn’t so much playing for his Browns future as he is playing for the chance to thrive elsewhere. That’s because the Browns made a $230m commitment to the injured Deshaun Watson and are determined to see if they can get their money’s worth when he returns to fitness. With this season long lost, really all that Shedeur has to play for is trade value, pride and teammate Myles Garrett shattering the single-season sack record – but of course that’s the popular spin.\n\nFor Shedeur, it’s just the latest chapter in a story that ends with him going down as the one of the biggest underdog success stories in sports – the draft afterthought who became an NFL legend. (Sound familiar?) That dissonance of an underdog with privilege shows the extent to which nepo babies have taken over the narrative.",

    "description": "The Browns lost yet another one, and this time to the measly Titans. So, yeah, we have some thoughts.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns' 31-29 loss to the Tennessee Titans in Week 14 was a study in frustrating contradictions.\n\nOn one hand, the team showed flashes of a potentially bright future, particularly on the offensive side of the ball. Rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a statistical performance that should give the organization and its fans genuine hope for the future, leading the offense on a thrilling, if ultimately incomplete, fourth-quarter comeback attempt. His connection with fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. was explosive and dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the loss starkly illuminated the systemic flaws that have plagued the Browns throughout this disappointing season. The defense, usually a bedrock of strength, struggled significantly, particularly against the run game, allowing a career-day for Titans running back Tony Pollard. Furthermore, the persistent issues on the offensive line and costly mistakes, including a momentum-killing interception and two failed two-point conversions, proved to be the difference against a struggling Titans team.\n\nThis defeat, dropping the Browns to 3-10, was a painful reminder that potential, even when dazzling, is no substitute for consistency and flawless execution, especially when facing a team desperate for a win.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the snowy, frustrating afternoon at Huntington Bank Field.\n\nShedeur Sanders showed another significant step in his development on Sunday, logging the best statistical game by a rookie quarterback this year with 364 yards passing and three touchdowns, plus a rushing score.\n\n23/42, 364 pass yds, 3 pass td, 29 rush yds, 1 rush td, 1 int\n\nmore highlights on https://t.co/xMzvHOeNay pic.twitter.com/mfCA7cgkGc\n\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 8, 2025\n\nSanders showed up when the team called his number, orchestrating two late touchdown drives. However, the one play he definitely wants back is a costly third-quarter interception on what looked to be a scramble drill attempt, where he overshot his man, flipping the game's momentum.\n\nSanders is still holding onto the ball longer and more often than any other quarterback in the league, leading to unnecessary pressure, sacks, and backbreaking turnovers. But if his can be ironed out further and his internal clock can be sped up, the Browns might just have their future quarterback already at the helm, proving he can handle the NFL stage.\n\nThe rookie tight end out of Bowling Green, Harold Fannin Jr., continued his impressive run as a leading pass-catcher for the Browns.\n\nFannin racked up 114 yards and a touchdown on eight receptions against the Titans, marking a career-high for the young player and joining Ozzie Newsome as the only rookie tight ends in Browns history to record a 100-yard receiving game.\n\nHis blend of size, hands, and route-running ability makes him a matchup nightmare, and he is quickly solidifying his place as a core component of the Browns' offense for years to come. In an offense struggling for consistent playmakers, Fannin Jr.'s emergence is a major win.\n\nLinebacker Devin Bush has been lights out for Jim Schwartz's defense this season.\n\nAgainst the Titans, he added a key interception to his stat sheet, reading quarterback Cam Ward's eyes perfectly for a 44-yard return that set up a Browns scoring drive. Bush is playing like the dynamic, first-round pick the Steelers thought they were getting out of Michigan all those years ago.\n\nDevin Bush intercepts Cam Ward!\n\nTENvsCLE on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/adKxo8zSCL\n\nIn a league that values three-down linebackers, his strong, consistent performance this year, especially in coverage, has positioned him for a substantial contract in the upcoming free agency period.\n\nThe myth of the weather advantage was definitively debunked on Sunday. As the snow fell, the Titans' lead grew, largely due to the Browns' defense slipping and sliding all over the grass.\n\nThe conditions seemed to hamper Cleveland’s pursuit angles and tackling, leading to a career game from Titans running back Tony Pollard, who ran for 161 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nTony Pollard 65-yard TOUCHDOWN.\n\nTENvsCLE on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/UZ9c5ifvfN\n\nThe Titans' effective ground-and-pound strategy mitigated the Browns' fearsome pass rush, turning the supposed home-field edge into a distinct disadvantage for the defense.\n\nWhile Shedeur Sanders' tendency to hold onto the ball for a long time certainly allows for more pressure to be created, the offensive line is not without blame.\n\nThe unit's lack of consistency in play and availability has been a recurring and season-long problem, culminating in a performance where key starters suffered significant injuries. With starting center Ethan Pocic reportedly suffering a likely season-ending Achilles injury and other starters battling injuries, the unit is in shambles.\n\nThe team is likely looking to replace four of the five starters this offseason. A number that could be jumping to five of five if veteran left guard Joel Bitonio finally decides to hang up the cleats at season's end.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns vs. Titans: 5 takeaways from Cleveland's NFL Week 14 loss",

    "description": "The Bills are two games behind New England but favored to win.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are tied for the best record in the NFL. And yet, they're not even favored at home this week.\n\nAn oddsmaker's power ranking doesn't always match public perception or a team's record. The Buffalo Bills are very unlikely to win the AFC East but they are still the favorites to win the AFC. The Bills have the shortest odds to win the conference at +375. That belief in the Bills is reflected in this week's point spread.\n\nThe Bills, who lost to the Patriots at home back in Week 5 and are two games behind New England in the standings, are 1-point favorites at BetMGM vs. the Patriots on Sunday. That's an interesting line.\n\nThe Patriots have been slighted a bit for playing the easiest schedule in the NFL so far this season, but winning 10 games in a row is difficult no matter the opposition. And the Patriots do have good road wins at Buffalo and at Tampa Bay. The Bills have Josh Allen, but they haven't been great. They have bad blowout losses to the Falcons and Dolphins. Last week they were in danger of losing to the Bengals at home until Christian Benford had a magical pick-6 and turned the game around. You can pick holes in New England's season if you wish, but the same can be done to the Bills. On top of it all, the Patriots are well rested coming off their bye week.\n\nMaybe Josh Allen plays the superhero role and keeps the Bills' chances at an AFC East title alive (the Patriots clinch the division title with a win on Sunday) but we'll give some respect to the Patriots and make them the pick at +1. It seems like getting proper respect won't be easy for this Pats team.\n\nHere are the rest of the picks for Week 15 in the NFL, with odds from BetMGM:\n\nIt's hard to back either team. The Bucs are coming off a miserable loss to the Saints, and their offense is in a slump. More specifically, Baker Mayfield is in a slump. His rating the last four games is 65.2. On the other side, the Falcons have lost seven of eight, and the last two gams were a loss to the lowly Jets and a 28-point loss to the Seahawks. But, we have to pick one of them.\n\nThe Bengals beat the Ravens 32-14 on Thanksgiving, in Baltimore. Not much has changed since. The Ravens are showing, week after week, they're not very good. So why are they favored here? Theoretically the Ravens could suddenly emerge as the stellar team everyone though they would be this season, but we've been waiting for that for months and it hasn't happened.\n\nIt seemed last week like the Commanders had one good performance left in them this season, and it came two weeks ago in a crushing overtime loss to the Broncos. Last week's effort against the Vikings was startlingly bad. They might already have their luggage packed for the trip to Cancun. The Giants aren't great either but they are rested after a bye.\n\nThere will be a few instances this week of teams in look-ahead spots. It's not all that common in the NFL, but how will the Bears get up to face the Browns when they know the Packers are coming to town six days later? The Browns have a good defense and until the past couple weeks, the theme of the Bears season was having a bunch of close wins, mostly over bad teams.\n\nThe only reason to believe in the Chiefs laying this many points is the argument that they are in must-win mode. But they've been in must-win mode for weeks. It hasn't mattered. The Chiefs aren't as bad as their 6-7 record (they're No. 6 in DVOA, haters) but this line seems a point or two too high. Would it be that surprising to see the Chargers win straight up?\n\nThe Eagles look broken and the Raiders are the NFL's worst team. What fun. Geno Smith is unlikely to start this week for the Raiders, which actually might not be a bad thing. Still, I can't take the Raiders. If there was ever a get-right spot for the Eagles, this is it. If they struggle here, they're really in trouble.\n\nBrady Cook might get the start for the Jets because Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor are hurt. Cook is an undrafted rookie who threw for 11 touchdowns in 12 games last season at Missouri. He'd be operating in an offense that hasn't been good no matter who is playing at quarterback. Anything seems possible in this weird NFL season, but this is a bad spot for the Jets.\n\nThe problem with taking the Cardinals is it's hard to figure out how they score on the NFL's best defense. But it's not like the Texans offense is a scoring bonanza either. Last week we took the Cardinals, based on the fact that a large number of their losses have been close. It didn't work out last week. Let's try again.\n\nThe Broncos certainly aren't without flaws, but a 2.5-point home underdog? That's surprising. Both 11-2 teams are underdogs at home this week, which says a lot about the wide-open nature of the NFL this season. Another factor in backing Denver: The Packers play at Chicago in Week 16 for what practically amounts to the NFC North title game. It shouldn't surprise anyone if they have an eye on that game.\n\nThis one is an even more extreme look-ahead spot. The Rams play at Seattle four days after this game in a meeting that could determine the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The Rams are a veteran team with a great coach, but how could they not be thinking a little bit about that game? Also, the Lions have extra rest after playing on Thursday night, which is usually an edge. Even if the Rams play well, the Lions have a good enough offense to always be in play for a backdoor cover. Be careful if you're taking the Rams here.\n\nThe Panthers have had a really weird season, with multiple quality wins and some miserable losses. One of those losses came to the Saints, and it wasn't all that close with New Orleans thoroughly outplaying Carolina in a 17-7 game. How could we know which Panthers team will show up? We'll hope for the one that is fighting for a division title late in the season.\n\nThe Titans have actually covered the spread in four of their last five games. It's not a good team but one that is still playing hard. The 49ers should blast the Titans. But that's not how the NFL typically works.\n\nThe Colts have eight wins and it wasn't just because of Daniel Jones. It has been a pretty good team this season, despite a recent slide. Yes, it's scary to depend on 44-year-old Philip Rivers or whoever plays quarterback against one of the NFL's best defenses. It could get ugly. But as is said often in this space, double-digit underdogs usually look hopeless, and then they somehow cover.\n\nProof that it would take a court order for the networks to flex a Cowboys game out of prime time. It's time to test whether Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy is turning a corner. He looked good last week, but that came against a really bad Commanders defense. If he can go on the road and have another positive outing against a Cowboys defense that has been better since the Quinnen Williams trade, maybe the narrative surrounding him will start to change. But let's see it happen first.\n\nThis is a strangely interesting game. The Dolphins started 1-6 but have rallied and aren't dead in the playoff race at 6-7. The Steelers can have some awful games, but they lead the AFC North at 7-6. It's a test for that Dolphins hot streak, considering they've been mostly beating bad teams and doing it with Tua Tagovailoa producing very little.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets were blown out in Week 14, losing 34-10 to the Miami Dolphins in Week 14.\n\nTheir record stands at 3-10 with four games remaining. The real-time 2026 NFL draft order is becoming clearer every week.\n\nThe Jets are slated to possess two first-round picks in 2026, their own and the one originally belonging to the Indianapolis Colts, as a result of the Sauce Gardner blockbuster trade. New York entered the weekend with their own selection at No. 7 overall and it did not change following Sunday's results.\n\nFive 3-10 teams are currently scheduled to own picks 4-8, and head coach Aaron Glenn's squad has the second-best strength of schedule (.541) among that group.\n\nThe Jets stay at No. 7 in the draft order, per ⁦@tankathon⁩ pic.twitter.com/M3Sl1GqZk7\n\n— Brian Costello (@BrianCoz) December 8, 2025\n\nIn better news, the pick originally belonging to the Colts was slated for 23rd overall entering Week 14. Following the Colts' blowout loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, it has improved to No. 21. Starting quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles injury and Indianapolis fell to third place in the AFC South.\n\nThe Jets still don't own a top-five selection. If quarterbacks Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields aren't able to return following their Week 14 injuries, it's difficult to imagine the Jets winning a game with rookie undrafted QB Brady Cook in the lineup. We'll be monitoring the updated draft order every week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Where are the Jets' Round 1 picks after Week 14 loss?",

Players become eligible five years after ending their career and, in his first year of eligibility, Rivers has been named a semi-finalist for the class of 2026.\n\nIf he remains on the Colts' practice squad, he will maintain his eligibility, but if he is elevated to the active roster, he will not be eligible again until the class of 2031.",

After playing games in the German city in both 2022 and 2024, the NFL announced Wednesday it will return to Munich in both 2026 and 2028 for regular-season games.\n\nThe move is part of a multiyear partnership with both the city of Munich and FC Bayern Munich. Games will be hosted at Allianz Arena, where FC Bayern Munich plays its home games.\n\nThe NFL today announced it will return to Munich, Germany in 2026 and 2028 to play regular season games, as part of a multi-year partnership with the City of Munich and FC Bayern Munich.\n\nThe games will be played at the FC Bayern Munich Stadium.\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 10, 2025\n\nFC Bayern Munich confirmed the partnership, with the mayor of Munich, Verena Dietl, expressing excitement over \"spreading the enthusiasm\" for American football in the city.\n\n\"I’m delighted about the extension of our contract with the NFL and it once again shows the importance and strength of Munich as a sporting city. The previous games not only won the hearts of the fans, but also strengthened our successful cooperation with the NFL. Together, we’re committed to promoting American football in Germany and spreading the enthusiasm for the sport far beyond the stadiums. I'm looking forward to the upcoming games in 2026 and 2028, which will not only bring top-class sport, but also valuable impetus for grassroots sport in our city.\"\n\nThe NFL has played regular-season games in Munich two other times. The Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers played at Allianz Arena in 2022, with the Bucs coming out on top. Two years later, the Carolina Panthers beat the New York Giants in Munich.\n\nGermany is no stranger to hosting NFL games at this point. In addition to those two contests, the Indianapolis Colts and Atlanta Falcons played a regular season game in Berlin, Germany earlier this year. The Colts won thanks to a tremendous performance from running back Jonathan Taylor.\n\nThe NFL has not announced which teams will take part in the Munich game in 2026 or 2028.\n\nIn recent years, the NFL has pushed to expand play outside the United States. The league has scheduled a number of international games each year, with six taking place during the 2025 NFL season. The NFL has played at least one game in the United Kingdom regularly since the 2007 season and has expanded international play to Brazil, Spain and Mexico, among other countries, in recent seasons.\n\nThe 2026 Munich game marks one of six international games announced by the NFL for next season. In addition to playing in Germany next year, the NFL will also play in Australia, Brazil and Mexico. The league will also play two games in the United Kingdom in 2026.\n\nThe league announced the Los Angeles Rams will play in the Australia game and that the Jacksonville Jaguars will appear in one of the games in the United Kingdom, but have not revealed any other teams taking part in international games next season.",

    "description": "We’re back in the top 10 baybeee",
    "fullText": "As Week 15 approaches, we rounded up the latest NFL power rankings to get a sense of how the Jaguars are viewed nationally.\n\nTrevor Lawrence has taken major strides the past two weeks. It’s all starting to click in the new offense.\n\nThey played once at Levi’s Stadium this year. Could they be returning?\n\nMost shocking statistical ranking: Wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr . is 50th in receiving yards\n\nExpectations were pretty high for Thomas after a big rookie season — 1,282 yards (third in the NFL) and 10 TDs — but he has had issues catching the ball (five drops) and rookie Travis Hunter moved ahead of Thomas into the No. 1 receiver role by Week 7 before Hunter ‘s season-ending injury. Thomas did miss three games because of an ankle injury and has had five catches for 115 yards in the two games since his return. But the team now views Jakobi Meyers — whom they traded for on Nov. 4 — as its No. 1 wideout. Thomas has 535 receiving yards so far.\n\nThey’re holding steady at No. 9 − and now firmly atop the AFC South with fifth-year QB Trevor Lawrence playing his most efficient football of the season heading into the stretch drive.\n\nNothing about Jacksonville’s successful season has felt intentional, let alone sustainable, but I think that the Jaguars are turning the corner. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has finally found a good rhythm in the passing game, his receivers are catching the ball again, and the playoff picture is shaping up for the Jags to win a game or two this postseason.\n\nAfter saying all that, I’m positive that this team will repay my belief by embarrassing itself in the next couple of weeks.\n\nBeating the Colts was huge and probably wrapped up the AFC South for them. Still, it’s hard not to wonder how the game would’ve played out if Indy hadn’t lost QB Daniel Jones.\n\nIf you were to ask me to identify Jacksonville’s superpower, I’d probably stumble my way through an answer before mentioning the run defense. But once Daniel Jones was knocked out of Sunday’s game, the Jaguars flexed their muscles and put the Colts away to wrest temporary control of the division. The Texans are coming, but these Jaguars are making things work in Liam Coen’s first season. He might be running third in the Coach of the Year race behind Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson, but Coen’s offense looked nice early against Indy before slowing down after halftime. All in all, though, this team is playing good football at the right time. Jacksonville has allowed just 13 points per game over the past four, and it’s looking like the Jags could face undrafted rookie Brady Cook at QB when the Jets come to town this Sunday.\n\nThe Jaguars took control of the NFC South on Sunday, and there’s a good chance they secure their first division title since 2022 by winning three of their final four games.\n\nWith Daniel Jones injured for Indianapolis, the Denver Broncos are probably the only playoff-caliber challenge left on Jacksonville’s schedule. If the Jags don’t play down to the competition against the Colts, Jets and Titans, they’ll host a playoff game.\n\nHow Jacksonville actually fares in the postseason will hinge on Trevor Lawrence’s play and the defense’s ability to force turnovers. The Jaguars haven’t won the turnover battle and lost a game since Week 2.\n\nAs wrong as I was about how Ben Johnson’s demeanor was going to translate to leading an NFL locker room, I may have been equally wrong about Liam Coen. Just look at the immaculate vibes taking place here.\n\nSunday changed everything in the AFC South. The Colts lost Daniel Jones, and the Jaguars picked up a critical win. It’s hard to watch the Jaguars and Texans and believe Jacksonville is the better team right now (more on the Texans in a bit) but they do lead the division. The AFC South might come down to whether the Jaguars can beat the Broncos or the Texans can beat the Chargers, because the other remaining games for both teams are all winnable.\n\nFrom Josh Kendall and Chad Graff:\n\nThe Jaguars’ first-year coach is in a neck-and-neck race with the Bears’ Ben Johnson for the most performative postgame locker room speeches. After Jacksonville won for the fifth time in six games Sunday, Coen looked on the verge of breaking his players’ hands high-fiving. He has the players believing, though. Josh Hines-Allen was even talking about the Super Bowl after recording his seventh sack.\n\nThe Jaguars’ average rank this week is 9.6 (last week: 11.2).\n\nThe #Jaguars keep on climbing pic.twitter.com/mJqYwcOuw0\n\n— Duval 22 (@duval22dotcom) December 10, 2025\n\nWhere would you rank the team, Jaguars fans?

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals announced a practice squad addition and had a player from the practice squad depart. Cornerback Chigozie Anusiem, who had been on the practice squad since the start of the season, was signed by the Las Vegas Raiders to their active roster.\n\nThe Cardinals announced the signing of receiver Steven Sims, who had a tryout with the team on Monday.\n\nSims is 5-10 and 176 pounds. He has been in the NFL since 2019, playing for Washington, Pittsburgh, Houston and Baltimore. He has played in 53 games, starting six, and has 78 career receptions for 704 yards and five touchdowns. He also has averaged 25.2 yards on kick returns with a touchdown in his career.\n\nIt would not be a surprise to see him elevated this weekend to return kicks against the Houston Texans.\n\nWith Anusiem's departure, the Cardinals have 16 players on the practice squad. They have one vacancy. Here is the current makeup of the unit.\n\nDL Denzel Daxon (international exemption)\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

That would suggest it's a value.\n\nAnd if 44-year old Philip Rivers comes out with a mojo that only he can have, the Colts could win this game for sure.\n\nMORE: How the 6-7 meme sums up the Chiefs' season perfectly\n\nThe spread, in the ballpark of 13 or 14 points, is a tough one, too.\n\nYes, Seattle is playing great.

    "description": "Mendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also probably be a top candidate for a job in finance.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",
