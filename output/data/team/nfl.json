    "fullText": "We’re heading into the final week of the 2025 NFL season, and the Rams won’t know where they stand for the postseason until we get to the other side of it.\n\nAs of right now, the Rams are slotted in at the No. 6 Wild Card spot, but things could shift depending on how Saturday’s late game between the Seahawks and 49ers shakes out. If the Seahawks win on Saturday, and the Rams beat the Cardinals on Sunday, then LA can wrap up the fifth seed. That would involve traveling to face the four-seed, which will be the NFC South winner. The Buccaneers are penciled into that spot right now after Saturday afternoon’s win over the Panthers, but they now need the Falcons to lose to the Saints on Sunday to cement their NFC South win.\n\nIf the Rams lose and the 49ers win, the Rams will stay in the sixth seed. In that case, they’ll play either the Eagles or the Bears to kick off the postseason, and I think it goes without saying that the 5-seed is the better option here.\n\nHere are the updated standings before Saturday’s games kick off in Week 18.\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks (13-3) – Clinched playoff spot\n2. Chicago Bears (11-5) – Clinched NFC North\n3. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5) – Clinched NFC East\n4. Carolina Panthers (8-8)\n5. San Francisco 49ers (12-4) – Clinched playoff spot\n6. Los Angeles Rams (11-5) – Clinched playoff spot\n7. Green Bay Packers (9-6-1) – Clinched playoff spot\n11. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9)",

    "fullText": "Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers held off Carolina 16-14 on Saturday to keep their playoff hopes alive to the bitter end of the NFL season.\n\nThe victory prevented the Panthers from locking up the NFC's last post-season berth and leaves both teams anxiously watching Sunday's results to learn which one progresses.\n\nTampa Bay edged an error-strewn, rain-soaked clash, taking an early lead and relying on cautious tactics and multiple field goals to cling on.\n\n\"We just found a way to win right there -- tough divisional opponent, and we did everything we could today,\" said Bucs' quarterback Mayfield.\n\n\"Sit back and see what happens tomorrow,\" said Mayfield, who threw for a touchdown, completing 16-of-22 attempted passes for 203 yards.\n\nDespite both teams ending the regular season with an 8-9 losing record, one of them is still guaranteed to win the historically weak NFC South division and reach the playoffs.\n\nWhether the Bucs or the Panthers advance now depends on the outcome of a clash between two teams with no hope of reaching the playoffs -- the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints.\n\nTampa Bay, who have won the NFC South for the past four years and started this season well before imploding, will be rooting for the bottom-placed but in-form Saints.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolina must rely on inconsistent Atlanta. If the Falcons win, a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9 would see the Panthers edge through on head-to-head results.\n\nTampa Bay scored on the game's opening drive, as tight end Cade Otton belatedly caught his first touchdown of the season, and the Bucs soon added a field goal.\n\nBut following an intercepted Baker Mayfield pass, a wide-open Tommy Tremble grabbed a Panthers touchdown with a clever, mazy run.\n\nWith torrential downpours hampering both sides, another interception -- this time off Carolina's Bryce Young -- set up another Bucs field goal for a 13-7 half-time lead.\n\nRain eased in the second half, but not before kicker Ryan Fitzgerald slipped to miss a 54-yard Panthers field goal attempt.\n\nNerves grew among the home crowd as Tampa Bay adopted ultra-cautious tactics to protect a slender lead.\n\nBut favorable decisions by officials -- a missed penalty, plus two pass interference calls -- helped Tampa Bay reach a 16-7 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter yet another rain-soaked Panthers fumble, and a blocked Tampa Bay field goal attempt, Jalen Coker caught an eight-yard touchdown with just over two minutes remaining to bring Carolina hope.\n\nBut the Buccaneers held on. A grinning Mayfield said he will now learn if his season will continue into the playoffs \"from my own couch.\"",

    "description": "Tampa Bay's 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers means the NFC South title will be decided on the NFL regular season's final day.",
    "fullText": "The NFL runs a risk every May when its schedule comes out – hoping those “TBD” slots it reserves for the Saturday of Week 18 ultimately get filled by games worthy of the standalone broadcast windows.\n\nJan. 3 provided further proof that the league knows what it’s doing – serving up a pair of matchups with massive postseason stakes. And even then, the schedule makers got another win – the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers actually failing to decide the NFC South title (more on that later).\n\nThat won’t be the case Saturday night, when the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks will definitively decide who wins the NFC West and the conference’s No. 1 overall playoff seed.\n\nBut, for now, here are the winners, losers – and otherwise – from Saturday’s games:\n\nThe Bucs and Panthers now knotted with 8-9 records, the winner of the division is still unknown. In a vacuum, Tampa Bay owns the common-games tiebreaker that puts the team in its near-perennial spot atop the division. But if the Falcons create a three-way tie by winning Sunday, Carolina would get the tiebreaker by virtue of a 3-1 mark against the Falcons and Bucs, eclipsing the other two teams.\n\nStill undefeated. The footing at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium was bad, and it was evident as players slipped, kicks were affected, and the general quality of play was impacted in such a critical game.\n\nThe home of “Monday Night Football” continues to enjoy an expanded presence late in the season, broadcasting both of Saturday’s consequential duels with another to come during the wild-card round of the playoffs. A year from now, ESPN will have the Super Bowl for the first time – though it will be simulcast on ABC. And Disney’s NFL footprint is only likely to continue growing ahead of its pending deal to acquire NFL Network, RedZone Channel and other media assets owned and controlled by the NFL, the crossover between the entities already readily apparent.\n\nHey, a team eliminated from postseason contention weeks ago now has something tangible to play for Sunday in its finale against the New Orleans Saints. Not only might a season-ending four-game winning streak save this coaching staff but knocking off the Bucs in the process would be especially sweet.\n\nThe Carolina running back, who ran for nearly 1,100 yards in 2024 for the Dallas Cowboys but was grossly undervalued by them and the free agent market has essentially matched that figure this season and earned a $1 million bonus Saturday by reaching 1,350 yards from scrimmage. Dowdle, who signed a $2.75 million contract with the Panthers before the season – and prior to hitting his incentive Saturday and others previously – should see a lot more green on the market a few months from now.\n\nIn what might have been the 14-year veteran's final game – or at least the linebacker's last one with the Bucs, his contract set to expire after the season – he recorded six stops Saturday to tie Hall of Famer Derrick Brooks as the most prolific tackler in franchise history.\n\nWith Carolina set up in the Bucs’ red zone early in the fourth quarter and trailing by nine, Dowdle slipped while tossing the ball back to QB Bryce Young on an apparent flea flicker. Fumble … and pretty much game, set and match. Tampa Bay didn't actually convert the turnover into points but did burn nearly six precious minutes off the clock before getting a field-goal try blocked. (Regardless, Dowdle still gets to keep his milli.)\n\nFUMBLE! The @Buccaneers jump on the loose ball 😤\n\nCARvsTB on ESPN/ABC\nStream on @NFLPlus and ESPN App pic.twitter.com/T7Pln5ymPn\n\nWhether it was the lateral that was prematurely blown dead − though the officials still moved the Panthers back 7 yards − or the dubious offensive pass interference against Tetairoa McMillan, which wiped out his 32-yard reception, the zebras were especially unkind to Carolina as it tried to whittle down a 13-6 halftime deficit.\n\nKicking off Saturday without injured starters – especially studs like all-universe LT Trent Williams and WR1 Ricky Pearsall – was hardly an ideal way to take on the mighty Seahawks defense with so much hanging in the balance.\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFC South playoff spot up for grabs after Bucs top Panthers",

He then had to prepare for his first NFL start on Christmas night on just three days' notice, and wound up throwing for just 66 yards. Expect a better performance with 10 days to prepare for this one.\n\nQBs Kenny Pickett and Aidan O'Connell. With Geno Smith dealing with a significant ankle injury, coach Pete Carroll said he expected both to play. Each will have a chance to show that the Raiders should bring him back next season or for one of the other 31 clubs to take notice.\n\nRaiders RB Ashton Jeanty vs. Chiefs defensive front. This hasn't been the kind of season Jeanty envisioned, but he is 112 yards from 1,000. He might have trouble reaching that milestone against a Chiefs defense that ranks 10th in allowing 104.9 yards per game. But Kansas City has given up 409 yards rushing in missed tackles, according to Next Gen Stats. Jeanty has gained 350 yards after breaking tackles, so he might have a chance.\n\nChiefs: RG Trey Smith (ankle) is unlikely to play. The Chiefs already have OTs Jawaan Taylor, Wanya Morris and Josh Simmons on injured reserve, along with Mahomes, Minshew, CBs Trent McDuffie Chris Roland-Wallace and Jaylen Watson, LB Leo Chenal and WRs Rashee Rice, Nikko Remigio and Tyquan Thornton.\n\nRaiders: QB Geno Smith (ankle) likely won't play. ... DT Adam Butler (bicep) wasn’t as seriously hurt as feared and could play. ...

The Chiefs and Raiders have met in three playoff games with Kansas City winning two of them.\n\nKansas City has lost five straight and seven of its past nine. ... The Chiefs are assured of their first losing season since 2012, the year before Andy Reid took over as coach. They went 2-14 that season under Romeo Crennel. ... Kansas City has had 272 yards of offense combined over the past two weeks. It has not eclipsed 275 yards in any of its past four games. ... Chiefs TE Travis Kelce needs 46 yards receiving to reach 13,000 for his career. He has caught a pass in 189 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NFL and longest streak in franchise history. ... DT Chris Jones needs one sack to tie Neil Smith (85 1/2) for third most in Chiefs history. ... The Raiders have lost 10 consecutive games, tied with a skid last season for the fifth-longest skid in franchise history. Another defeat would tie for the third longest which was set in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. The Raiders' longest losing streaks were 19 games in the 1961-62 seasons and 16 in 2013-14. ... Las Vegas' losing streak is the longest active one in the NFL. ... The Raiders have a point differential of minus-193, worst in the NFL. ... Their average point different is minus-12.1 per game. If it doesn't improve, that will be the highest since the 2020 New York Jets finished with a minus-13.4 average. ...

LB Devin White's 168 tackles are second to Miami's Jordyn Brooks, who has 174. ... ... The Raiders have held opponents to zero or negative yards on 95 rushing plays, tied with Minnesota for best in the league. ... A victory would give Las Vegas coach Pete Carroll 173 for his career, which would move him into a tie for 16th with Jeff Fisher. Carroll is currently tied with Bill Parcells.\n\nThe Chiefs defense might be worth a look given the Raiders offensive struggles.

    "description": "Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo should be no stranger to upcoming open head coaching interviews.",
    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s Jordan Raanan, Indianapolis Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo is among the initial top interview candidates for the New York Giants current head coaching vacancy:\n\n“The first assignment is to find a new head coach. The Giants fired Brian Daboll almost eight weeks ago and named Mike Kafka the interim head coach,” writes Ranaan.\n\n“The team had a head start on compiling a list of candidates that includes former NFL head coach Mike McCarthy, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, former Raiders coach and Giants player Antonio Pierce and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, among others. Kafka will also be given an interview.”\n\nWhoever is ultimately hired in New York will replace Brian Daboll, who coached the Giants from 2022-25.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Anarumo has been linked to an NFL head coaching opening, as he’s previously been connected in-season as a top candidate for the Tennessee Titans vacancy through multiple league reports respectively.\n\nNicknamed the “Mad Scientist,” the 59-year-old veteran defensive coordinator has been lauded for his ability to tailor his defensive gameplans weekly to stopping the opposing competition, even giving the likes of Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes some trouble in the past among other elite quarterbacks.\n\nIn his debut campaign with the Colts, there’s no question that Anarumo has been a significant upgrade to his Colts veteran defensive coordinator predecessor Gus Bradley.\n\nWhen healthy and going right, the Colts had a formidable unit this season.\n\nThat being said, after losing arguably the defense’s three best players down the season’s late stretch due to key injuries, namely to DeForest Buckner, Sauce Gardner, and Charvarius Ward, the Colts defense has since fallen on some hard times to close out this season. It no longer recently resembles the Top 10 defensive unit that it was for the majority of the 2025 campaign because of the loss of its best players.\n\nIt’s hard to win on defense in the NFL without your horses. Much less, there’s personnel issues with the Colts lack of consistent outside pass rush that go beyond Anarumo and key injuries down the final stretch.\n\nAnarumo has paid his coaching dues, has a track record of success, and is deserving of strong consideration for any NFL head coaching opening this upcoming offseason. However, it would be a real shame if he only gets to coach the Colts defense for one season. To me, he’s a top candidate to return in Indianapolis as defensive coordinator even in the rare case that Colts head coach Shane Steichen surprisingly doesn’t.\n\nGiven that we really didn’t see this unit fully together healthy upon Gardner’s arrival, Anarumo’s coaching best is still theoretically yet to come in Indianapolis—if we even get to see it again.",

    "title": "Drake Maye Could be the NFL MVP",
    "description": "It’s seemingly a race between him and Matthew Stafford, but just reaching this point is amazing for the UNC alum",
    "fullText": "After the 2024 draft, if you could have laid money down on which quarterback of the trio of Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, and Drake Maye would win the NFL MVP first, you probably would have gotten some long odds on Maye.\n\nOf the three, he was considered the biggest “project” going into the NFL. Those odds, if anything, seemed longer after the Washington Commanders invested heavily in their team going into the 2024 season and Daniels was able to take his team to the NFC Title game, losing to the eventual champ Philadelphia Eagles. Meanwhile, the Patriots were still suffering from the malaise at the end of the Bill Belichick era as first-year coach Jerod Mayo struggled to find any traction, and while Maye had showed some promise he ended his season on the sidelines as the Patriots tried — and failed — to get the number one overall pick for 2025.\n\nSo the deck seemed stacked for Maye to have an ascendent season. Mayo was out right after that last game, and Maye didn’t really provide much comment to reporters when the season concluded. In came Mike Vrabel as the head coach and Josh McDaniels as the offensive coordinator. The Patriots made moves in the offseason, but staring at being in the same division as the Buffalo Bills and 2024 MVP Josh Allen, the vibe for the team going into 2025 was hoping to use an easier schedule to finish above .500 and build toward having a consistent team for the first time in years.\n\nAfter a start that seemed to be what people were expecting, Maye had a signature game against Allen and the Bills in front of a national audience in Buffalo. It was enough to where Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth were calling for respect to be given to Maye and the offense, and included a game-winning field goal drive. That game was one of a ten-game winning streak for New England, and during that stretch highlight after highlight would pop on social media.\n\nMaye and the Patriots stumbled against the Bills after the bye and were again on Sunday Night Football, this time against Baltimore. By this point talk had gotten loud of Maye being the NFL MVP, but his loss to Buffalo seemingly ceded the title to the Rams’ Matthew Stafford. That week, though, things seemingly flipped back in Maye’s favor. First off, the other seeming contender in Matthew Stafford lost a close game to Seattle on Thursday Night and ceded control of the division to the Seahawks. Then on Sunday, Maye delivered yet another signature performance that included an 11-point fourth-quarter comeback, 380 yards in the air, two touchdowns, and a game-clinching run after the defense helped give the team a chance.\n\nEdge of our seats 🤯 pic.twitter.com/oVUiYbocXZ\n\n— z – New England Patriots (@Patriots) December 23, 2025\n\nMaye followed that up this past weekend with a foot-on-the-throat approach that showed he and the Patriots may have found another gear.\n\nDrake Maye MVP level performance was legendary against the #Jets\n\nFirst QB to ever have 90% completion percentage, 250+ yards and 5 TDS.#NEPats \n\n pic.twitter.com/DNAGtE3U2r\n\n— NFL Numbers Guy (@NFLNumbersGuy) December 29, 2025\n\nMatthew Stafford followed by losing to the Atlanta Falcons on the road and now all of a sudden, Drake Maye is the betting favorite to win the MVP. He would be the first Tar Heel alum to do so since Lawrence Taylor in 1986.\n\nAll of this is bittersweet for UNC fans. Earlier in the week on 98.5 The Sports Hub, a host during drive time was recounting this historic rise and mused “he’s obviously so talented you look at those years at North Carolina and wonder how they didn’t win more.” Fans likely felt that disturbance in the force and screamed “MACK BROWN, PHIL LONGO, AND CHIP LINDSEY!” Those that watched those amazing two years of Maye under center could see the talent, the skill and know that the combination of inept coaching on defense and some lack of support on offense really kept Maye from achieving the heights he should have.\n\nStill, it’s a source of pride for UNC fans that had to hear in the lead-up to the draft about how Maye was the weakest of the top three. Those that watched knew, and there’s a delicious irony that the former Patriots and current UNC coach likely wouldn’t have taken Maye for that team — and now Maye is on the doorstep of his first major NFL award and leading the Patriots back to the top tier of the NFL.",

    "description": "Returning to the Colts didn't just mean another hefty paycheck for Philip Rivers. It meant access to a strong health plan for another five years.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers caused quite a stir when he returned to the NFL in December 2025 as a 44-year-old grandpa.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts, plagued by injuries and with limited options, called up their former quarterback to try to salvage a season that started red-hot. Rivers spent the majority of his NFL career with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, but signed with the Colts in 2020 and played one full season before retiring after a playoff loss in January 2021.\n\nAnother clock reset as soon as he was added to the Colts' active roster: Rivers extended his NFL-sponsored health insurance, which was set to expire in 2026, by another five years.\n\nThis benefit emerged from the 2006 NFL-NFLPA agreement, which stipulates that players who are on any NFL roster for three or more seasons are entitled to five years of health insurance after retirement.\n\nIt's particularly advantageous to Rivers, a father of 10. Each of his kids is under the age of 26, making them each eligible as dependents. His wife, Tiffany, is also eligible.\n\nAs for the actual medical plan, here are some highlights of his benefits, as outlined in The NFL Player Insurance Plan published in 2020.\n\nHealth insurance plans vary tremendously from company to company, and also from plan to plan within the same company. I decided to see how the NFL plan stacks up to the High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) I'm enrolled in. Compare it to yours if you're curious.\n\nAnnual deductible. This is the amount you pay each year before insurance starts covering most costs.\n\nNFL plan: $850 per person / $1,700 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $3,000 per person / $6,000 per family\n\nWhile an NFL player only has to spend $850 on covered care before insurance kicks in, I'd have to spend $3,000 out-of-pocket before coverage begins. Note that my plan literally has \"high deductible\" in its name, but the tradeoffs for high upfront costs include a lower premium and access to a tax-advantaged savings account called an HSA.\n\nOut-of-pocket maximum. This is the most you have to pay in a year for covered health care, after which the insurance plan pays 100% of covered costs for the rest of that plan year.\n\nNFL plan: $2,000 per person / $5,000 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $6,000 per person / $12,000 per family\n\nWith a cap of $2,000 per person, an NFL player's worst-case medical year is fairly limited, whereas I'd be on the hook for $6,000. Of course, I'm taking fewer hits working behind a desk rather than behind an offensive line.\n\nPremium. This is the fixed amount you pay regularly — usually every month — to keep your health insurance active.\n\nNFL plan: $0/month. According to the 2020 NFL Player Insurance Plan, \"The Clubs fund the NFL Player Trust that pays for the benefits provided and insurance premiums owed under the Plan.\"\n\nMy HDHP: I also pay $0. Again, the tradeoff is the higher deductible.\n\nFor Rivers, returning to the Colts didn't just mean another hefty paycheck; it meant access to a strong health plan with low deductibles, capped out-of-pocket costs, and broad medical coverage.\n\nThe Colts are officially out of the playoffs, and he'll be sitting out during Week 18. If he retires for good this year, he and his family don't have to worry about shopping around for insurance until 2031.",

New Orleans Saints passer Tyler Shough and Tennessee Titans first overall pick Cam Ward were featured in a Mic'd Up clip from NFL Films to give us a look at each rookie's day at the office. It's clear they both have a strong presence, but you can see why guys are rallying around Shough after the Saints had a rough start to the season.\n\n\"Do your job all day,\" Shough said in the huddle, \"Great feet, great eyes, great technique. Make a play.\"\n\nIt's also clear that Shough has developed great chemistry with his leading wide receiver Chris Olave. He approached Olave on the bench late in regulation to tell him, \"We got to throw the ball to win the game. Throw the ball to win the game so whatever it takes bro.\" After connecting with Olave on a touchdown pass, the pair celebrated all the way back to the bench.\n\n\"Oh my God. Oh my God,\" Shough gasped, leaping to chest-bump Olave. \"I told you I'm gonna get you.\"\n\nShough vs Ward Mic'd Up 🔊\n\nJust 2 rising rookies putting on a clinic@Saints | @Titans | @InsideTheNFL pic.twitter.com/j6bm1njj8t\n\n— NFL Films (@NFLFilms) December 31, 2025\n\nIt's a really cool look at how Shough conducts himself on game days.

    "fullText": "The marathon is over. Sunday marks the end of the NFL regular season.\n\nIn recent years, Week 18 has signaled the end for the Chicago Bears. Not so this year. For the first time since 2020, the Bears are headed to the postseason. They have bigger goals on the horizon, starting with next week’s wild-card round of the playoffs.\n\nBut first, they have a matchup with the Detroit Lions. Sunday’s game has playoff implications. The simplest result is this: Win Sunday and they lock up the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a matchup with the No. 7 Green Bay Packers. A loss complicates matters a little, but the Bears are at least guaranteed a home game as NFC North champions.\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson already has declared his team is “playing to win.” Lions coach Dan Campbell said his squad will be competing, despite the fact they have nothing left to play for.\n\nThe Bears (11-5) square off against the Lions (8-8) on Sunday at Soldier Field (3:25 p.m., Fox-32). Here are five things to watch ahead of Week 18 — plus the Tribune’s predictions for the game.\n\nThe NFL season is a brutal, physical journey from the time training camp starts in July until the playoffs in January.\n\n“This is a race,” Johnson said on the day training camp began in July. The Bears are nearly at the end of the race now, and it has been a marathon more than a sprint.\n\nJust think about where the Bears and the Lions were nearly four months ago. In Week 2, the Lions cruised to a 52-21 win over the Bears at Ford Field. The Bears fell to 0-2, while the Lions looked like the team that won 15 games a year ago.\n\n“It’s early in the season and you’re still getting to know your team a little bit,” Johnson said this week as he reflected on that game. “Being in that locker room after that game and how that felt — you don’t always remember exactly what was said or anything like that, but you always remember how you felt in those moments.”\n\nMuch has changed in the 15 weeks since then. The Bears are gearing up for a playoff run, and the Lions will be watching the postseason from home. Things change rapidly in the NFL. After that loss in Detroit, the Bears won their next four games and nine of 10.\n\nThe Lions, on the other hand, started the season 7-4 and in a favorable position before losing four of the next five. A Christmas Day loss in Minnesota eliminated the Lions from postseason contention.\n\nCampbell suggested the Lions will play their starters, but he left some gray area with regard to players battling injury, which includes top receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and tackle Penei Sewell.\n\n“I think if it’s — we’re sitting there borderline, and the player, it could be hard (to play) or we think they’re setting themselves up for a long-term risk, then no, it’s not worth it,” Campbell told members of the Detroit media.\n\nWilliams needs 109 passing yards to break the Bears’ single-season record. Erik Kramer set the mark with 3,838 yards in 1995. Jay Cutler came close to topping it with 3,812 yards in 2014, but the record has stood for 30 years.\n\nChicago Bears QB Caleb Williams on 4,000 yards: ‘I was brought here for those types of things’\n\nWilliams has surpassed 109 passing yards in every game this season. Also in play is a 4,000-yard season, something no Bears quarterback has done. Ever. With 3,730 yards this season, Williams needs 270 to reach the milestone.\n\nThe primary goal remains to win the game. But Williams said this week that he believes he’s in Chicago to rewrite the record books at the quarterback position.\n\n“In 100 or however many years, it has never been done,” Williams said. “So it symbolizes something.”\n\nWilliams has played some of his best football over the last three games. In wins against the Cleveland Browns and Packers and a road loss to the San Francisco 49ers, he has averaged 274 passing yards with six touchdown passes and zero interceptions.\n\n“I’m playing better than I have,” Williams said. “These last three games, but even going back to some of the other games, some of the stats may not show it, but I feel that I’m playing better. I said it’s going to start showing here soon, and that’s a small sample of that. I’ve got to keep growing, keep getting better.”\n\nAbout that Week 2 beatdown in Detroit …\n\nThat’s exactly the type of game that the old Bears would’ve let bleed into the next week. A year ago, this same franchise lost on a brutal Hail Mary at Washington and went on to lose 10 consecutive games. Losing became inevitable.\n\nWhile the early-season loss in Detroit might have felt like a “here we go again” moment, Johnson has never let his team think too much about any one game.\n\n“That can kind of go one or two ways after that, right?” linebacker T.J. Edwards said. “And I think that shows where we’re at right now … having that belief in one another. It’s rare to have in a team where everyone is on the same page and everyone is understanding what we’re trying to get done. When those things are going wrong, it allows us to come together and make sure that it doesn’t stay that way.”\n\nColumn: Chicago Bears are ‘moving on to Detroit’ — but they won’t go far in playoffs if defense doesn’t improve\n\nIt’s a pertinent message this week, when the Bears are looking to brush off Sunday night’s loss in San Francisco. The Bears have built all sorts of momentum this season. They’ve been, all things considered, relatively healthy. Although the defense struggled against the 49ers, the team has played well overall during the toughest part of the schedule down the stretch.\n\n“It kind of just goes with Ben’s messaging every week,” Edwards said. “He’s been the same. He’s been consistent. So it’s easy for us to kind of follow. But it’s a week-to-week league, right? So after big wins, celebrate for a second and then you’ve got to get back to work, and after big losses it’s no different because there’s another one coming up.”\n\nThe Bears want to head into the postseason on a positive note. A win against the Lions would do that.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Commanders will also kick off at 3:25 p.m. If the Bears lose Sunday and the Eagles win, the Eagles would jump the Bears for the No. 2 seed, dropping the Bears to No. 3.\n\nThe No. 2 seed will play the Packers, who are locked in at No. 7. The No. 3 seed will play someone from the NFC West, either the 49ers or Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe Bears probably would rather take their chances against the Packers, a team they’ve played close twice already, winning once in dramatic fashion. The No. 2 seed also would play at home in the divisional round if it wins its first playoff game.\n\nReports out of Philadelphia have suggested the Eagles might sit their starters Sunday. That will be a situation to monitor. The Commanders, though, could start third-string quarterback Josh Johnson, so anything could happen even if the Eagles rest up for the playoffs.\n\nJohnson has said the Bears are playing to win, but might that change if the Eagles are down by two touchdowns at halftime?\n\nOdunze has missed four games with a foot injury. The Bears receiver hasn’t played since Nov. 28 in Philadelphia. Odunze has not participated in practice this week.\n\n“We’ll see how this week goes,” Johnson said when asked about Odunze.\n\nRookie receiver Luther Burden III suffered a quad injury on the last play against the 49ers but has been back on the practice field this week. That’s a good sign for the Bears.\n\nIn Detroit, a number of key starters have been on the injury report, including linebacker Alex Anzalone (concussion), defensive tackle Alim McNeill (abdomen), Sewell (ankle), St. Brown (knee/ankle) and left tackle Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness).\n\nBoth teams will release one more injury report Friday.\n\nThe Bears are looking to tighten things up defensively after a woeful showing in San Francisco and along come the Lions, who have some key injury concerns on offense involving wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and left tackle Taylor Decker, among others. Injuries also have rocked the Lions secondary, and opposing quarterbacks, with the exception of Minnesota Vikings undrafted rookie Max Brosmer last week, have lit up the Lions of late. The Bears have plenty of motivation with the No. 2 seed in the NFC there for the taking, even with reports that the Eagles, also in contention for that seed, are expected to rest key players for their finale against the Commanders.\n\nWeek 18 is weird. But I’m going to take Johnson’s word when he says the Bears are playing to win. I’m not convinced the Lions truly are, no matter what they say. They have nothing to play for. Beyond Week 18 weirdness, though, the Bears have shown in the second half of the season that they’re the better team. I think they cap off a remarkable turnaround with win No. 12.\n\nThe Lions are fizzling to a disappointing finish. The Bears have several incentives in this rematch: Secure the No. 2 seed, redeem the loss of a winnable game against the 49ers and avenge Week 2’s blowout loss in which the Lions ran up the score (don’t let anyone convince you otherwise). The Bears need to sharpen all phases heading into the playoffs, and the injury-riddled Lions look like sacrificial lambs.",

    "fullText": "Auburn football wide receiver Eric Singleton has punched his ticket to the 2026 NFL Draft. His announcement came via his social media.\n\nA massive transfer from Georgia Tech for the Tigers a year ago, Singleton played a total of three seasons in his collegiate. He spent two seasons with the Yellow Jackets recording over 700 yards in both seasons. This year with the Tigers he finished with 534 yards receiving on 57 receptions and three touchdowns. Singleton career totals were 2,002 yards receiving on 162 receptions and 12 receiving touchdowns.\n\nHugh Freeze's offense never seemed to fully unlock Singleton's potential at Auburn. The junior wide receiver had his lowest receiving and total yards at Auburn. Singleton did see a uptick after the Freeze firing and offensive coordinator Derrick Nix took over play calling. Against Vanderbilt, he hauled in 11 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown\n\nPreseason CBS Sports ranked him a top-10 receiver in the 2026 draft. Singleton's draft stock could rise in the coming months at the NFL Combine with a chance to showcase his speed and route running ability.\n\nContact/Follow us @TheAuburnWire on  X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "One of Missouri football’s best defensive players from the 2025 season is entering the NFL Draft process early.\n\nRedshirt sophomore Josiah Trotter, who spent one season with the Tigers and starred at the second level of Mizzou’s 2025 defense, has declared for the NFL Draft as a third-year entrant, he announced via his social media on Thursday, Jan. 1.\n\nIf he wanted them, Trotter had two years of remaining eligibility. He started his career at West Virginia and redshirted his first year in the sport. Trotter was a freshman All-American for the Mountaineers in 2024 before transferring to Mizzou.\n\nInstead, he’ll go through the draft process, and all indications suggest he will be a top-100 prospect this year.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Mizzou learned that fellow third-year and potential NFL Draft entrant Cayden Green will not declare for the draft and instead will return to Columbia in 2026.\n\nAll Glory to God pic.twitter.com/LB5N0p9DEv\n\n— Josiah Trotter (@TrotterJosiah) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Tigers are now waiting on a decision from one final third-year player: defensive end Damon Wilson II, who can stay or declare for the draft.\n\nTrotter was Mizzou’s leading tackler in his lone season in Columbia, racking up 84 total tackles, which included 13 hits behind the line of scrimmage and two sacks.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Trotter as the third-best run-stopping linebacker in the Southeastern Conference and as a top-five pass-rushing LB in the league.\n\nHe has significant professional pedigree in his family.\n\nHis father, Jeremiah Trotter Sr., was a four-time Pro Bowler and Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer who spent more than a decade in the league.\n\nJosiah Trotter’s older brother, Jeremiah Trotter Jr., was on the Eagles roster than won the Super Bowl last season.\n\nMock Draft Database has Trotter listed at No. 107 on its consensus big board for the 2026 draft, which is a fourth-round slot. It would not be a surprise to see the 6-foot-2, 237-pound linebacker climb higher as he goes through the NFL Scouting Combine and Pro Day.\n\nIt’s a significant loss for Mizzou’s defense.\n\nThe Tigers announced earlier Thursday that standout sophomore Nicholas Rodriguez will return in 2026. But, Mizzou is also set to lose two more players from its core, four-player rotation in Khalil Jacobs and Triston Newson to eligibility.\n\nThat means Missouri likely will be active in the transfer portal looking to fill those gaps.\n\nMore: Missouri football needs a QB for 2026.

    "description": "The NFL wraps up the 2025-26 regular season this weekend with Week 18. We break down which teams have something to play for and who is resting players.",
    "fullText": "We’ve made it! Week 18 of the NFL season is here and soon the playoffs will commence. But, we do have a few loose ends to tie up before we get to all that. We have the bulk of the teams destined for the playoffs already known, but there are a few stragglers and of course the dreaded jockeying for playoffs seeding. Guessing what NFL coaches will do is not something you want to make a living off of. But, we should be able to narrow this down enough to have a good idea as to who needs to win, who wants to win, and who doesn’t care if they win.\n\nBookmark this post, as we will continue to update as news comes in.\n\nThe Falcons gave the Buccaneers some late Christmas coal in their stocking by beating the Rams in Week 17. If the Falcons win this week over the Saints, the Buccaneers are eliminated from the playoffs even if they beat the Panthers on Saturday. The good news for us playing fantasy is that the NFL made that scenario moot with the Saturday game. Both teams will play for the win. If the Panthers win, they win the division and the playoff spot. If the Bucs win, they have to wait for the winner of the Falcons-Saints to decide the NFC South champion between the Panthers and Bucs.\n\nThis game isn’t as desperate as win and in, but whoever wins will get the No. 1 seed in the NFC and whoever loses will fall to the No. 5 seed. This one is pretty cut and dry and both teams will play their starters in hopes for a win.\n\nThe Steelers blew a chance to wrap up the AFC North as they laid an egg against the Browns in Week 17. The Ravens won their game against the Packers, making this matchup for all the marbles. Whoever wins, wins the North, the No. 4 seed, and the only playoff spot left in the AFC.\n\nThe Chargers have already announced they are resting Justin Herbert. The Broncos on the other hand need a win to get the No. 1 seed, which comes with a bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. They can still get that No. 1 seed if they lose and the Jaguars and Patriots both lose, but they won’t leave that one up for chance. They should play their starters until the game is in hand.\n\nThe Dolphins have nothing to play for, but the Patriots could finish with the 1, 2, or 3 seed in the AFC. To get the No. 1 seed they will need to win and for the Broncos to lose to the Chargers who are resting Herbert. If the Broncos win, the Patriots just need to beat the Dolphins to get the No. 2 seed. They could also lose and as long as the Jaguars lose, they’d still get the No. 2 seed. If they lose and both the Jaguars and Broncos win, then they end up with the No. 3 seed.\n\nThe Patriots should want that No. 2 seed enough to play all out.\n\nThe Titans have been eliminated from playoff contention for a while now and a loss can only help their draft position. The Jaguars on the other hand have come on like gangbusters and even have an outside shot at the No. 1 seed with a win. Unfortunately, the Chargers going with Trey Lance over Justin Herbert and the Patriots getting a relatively easy matchup with the Dolphins likely throws a wrench in those plans, as they’d need both teams to lose to get that coveted 1 seed.\n\nThe Jaguars do have to beat the Titans if they want to secure the AFC South title over the Texans, and the No. 3 seed though. And, a win of course gives them a shot at the No. 1 and 2 seeds if the Broncos or Patriots were to falter. They theoretically could fall all the way to the No. 7 seed with a loss. So they’re playing to win.\n\nThe Colts have been eliminated and will give rookie quarterback Riley Leonard the start over Phillip Rivers. The Texans have a wide variety of seedings possible between the No. 3 seed and the No. 7 seed. A win and a Jaguars loss to the Titans would give them the AFC South title and the No. 3 seed. A win secures them the No. 5 seed if the Jaguars win, while a loss could knock them down to the No. 6 or 7 seeds. These scenarios should be enough for them to do everything they can to win this week.\n\nIf the Bears win, they get the No. 2 seed. If they lose and the Eagles win, they get the No. 3 seed. Head coach Ben Johnson appeared adamant that they would play to win after their loss to the 49ers. A win and they face the Packers in the first round of the playoffs. If they lose, they’ll get the No. 3 seed and either face the 49ers or Rams at home. I’d expect them to play to win, but if news changes, we’ll update this post.\n\nThe Eagles and Bears are tied together this week as they both hope to grab the No. 2 seed in the NFC. The Bears have the inside track, as a win gives them the No. 2 seed, while the Eagles need a win and for the Bears to lose. When asked, head coach Nick Sirianni was non-committal as to if anyone would rest. The Eagles are guaranteed the No. 3 seed if they lose and/or the Bears win, but the No. 2 seed is worth playing for if they want.\n\nThe Jets have been out of contention for a while now and need a loss to keep or better their current No. 3 pick. The Bills currently have the final playoff seed at No. 7, but could move up to No. 5 or 6 with a win. To move up to the No. 5 seed they’ll need to win and for the Texans and Chargers to lose. To get the No. 6 seed they’ll need to win and have one of the Texans or Chargers lose.\n\nAt this point we’re waiting on head coach Sean McDermott to give us more intel on if he’ll play starters, but we do know all world QB Josh Allen isn’t 100% right now and beating the Jets isn’t exactly that tough. If I were them, I’d rest Allen. And at this point I wouldn’t want to trust Bills starters in fantasy games.\n\nHead coach Sean McVay says his starters will play this week, but there isn’t a whole lot to play for. If they win and the 49ers lose, they’d get the No. 5 seed. All other scenarios end them with the No. 6 seed. I could see McVay giving his starters a half and then shutting things down. I’d rather not rely on Rams players this week if I can help it.\n\nUPDATE 1/1 — Chris Olave will not play on Sunday. Nick Underhill is reporting a blood clot was detected in his lung. He will be fine, but is not going to play the season finale.\n\nThe Saints and Falcons are both eliminated from playoff contention, but Saturday afternoon could open the door this game to mean something. If the Bucs beat the Panthers on Saturday, a Falcons win over the Saints would clinch the NFC South for the Panthers. Even if the Panthers win on Saturday and clinch the division, Saints-Falcons is one of the more entertaining rivalries from the fans’ perspective. Whether it impacts the starting options for each team is unclear.\n\nJim Harbaugh announced that Trey Lance would get the start in Week 18 against the Broncos, which likely means other starters should see rest or limited work as well. But, even if all the other starters were a go, Lance is going to have a hell of a time against the Broncos defense in Denver.\n\nUPDATE 1/1 — Jordan Love has passed concussion protocol, but with the Packers unable to move out of the No. 7 seed, Clayton Tune will get the start, per Jason B. Hirschhorn.\n\nThe Packers are locked into the No. 7 seed, so they will rest key starters.\n\nThe Raiders and Chiefs have no playoff hopes left, but the Raiders currently have the No. 1 pick in the 2026 drat and they’d like to keep it. They’ve sat their best defensive player Maxx Crosby and now they’re going to sit Geno Smith for a combination of Kenny Pickett and Aidan O’Connell, per Vinny Bonsignore.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Times NFL writer Sam Farmer examines the matchups and makes his predictions for Week 18 of the NFL season.\n\nAll lines and over/under numbers are according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nLast week, Farmer posted a 9-7 (.563) record. Through the first 17 weeks of the season, he is 164-92 (.641).\n\nUsing point spreads with the scores Farmer predicted, his record against the spread in Week 17 would have been 4-12 (.333). For the season, his record against the spread is 120-136 (.469).\n\nAll times are Pacific and TV reflects broadcasts in the Los Angeles area.\n\nSaturday, 1:30 p.m. TV: ABC, ESPN.\n\nLine: Buccaneers by 3. O/U: 44½.\n\nThis was a three-point win by the Panthers when these teams met two weeks ago and figures to be just about that close in the rematch. Hard to trust Tampa Bay, which has lost seven of its last eight games. This showdown comes down to the wire and Carolina wins with a field goal to clinch the NFC South title.\n\nPick: Panthers 24, Buccaneers 21\n\nSaturday, 5 p.m. TV: ABC, ESPN.\n\nLine: Seahawks by 1½. O/U: 49½.\n\nAs hot as Seattle is, San Francisco is surging and has the experience and home crowd at its back. It will be a really physical game and the winner claims the conference title. Seattle has lost seven of eight to the 49ers with the only win being last season and by three points.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Packers are locked in as the No. 7 seed, and the Vikings are playing for pride. Have to believe with all the injuries his team has dealt with, Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur is going to make preserving health a priority. So no matter what happens at quarterback, I like the Vikings winning at home.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Philip Rivers experiment was so much fun, but now it’s back to planning for the future with Riley Leonard. Division crown is a longshot for Texans, but they can still improve their seeding.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nLine: Jaguars by 11½. O/U: 47½.\n\nThe Titans were on the wrong end of a laugher when these teams met at the end of last month. Now they’re playing for pride whereas the Jaguars have every incentive to keep their foot on the gas. The Jaguars have won seven in a row, averaging 30 points during that streak.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nHere are a couple teams who are out of the playoff race but have assembled winning streaks. The Falcons handled the Saints pretty easily in New Orleans last month and should win a closer game at home.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nIt’s a small consolation but the Cowboys are determined to finish with a .500 record, so they’re incentivized. Pride and a pass rush will keep the three-win Giants in this one. Figures to be reasonably high-scoring, although that could be tempered by a bitter-cold breeze.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nBengals coach Zac Taylor says it’s “an absolute nightmare” for his team to face Myles Garrett, and that might be so, but Cincinnati gets the edge in this one. Joe Burrow over Shedeur Sanders. The Bengals have six wins and the Browns have four. Do you still call that state bragging rights?\n\nCertainly not a meaningless game for the Rams. They need to gather some momentum heading into the postseason, because at the moment they’re rolling backward. The Cardinals have surrendered an average of 37 points in the past four games (all losses). Rams roll, but what does it portend?\n\nLine: Broncos by 11½. O/U: 36½.\n\nThe Chargers are resting Justin Herbert and other starters, so this is about getting out of Denver without injuries. Trey Lance has accounted for himself well in those rare chances he gets, but he’ll be under heavy pressure from that Broncos pass rush. These teams keep it on the ground to make it a quick one.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Bears need to recapture some of their swagger after losing at San Francisco, and the Lions are leaking confidence by the week. Six turnovers? Really? The Lions are going to play hard for Dan Campbell, but disdain for a division rival will only take them so far.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Bills can improve their playoff seeding with a win, and the Jets have packed it in for the season. Buffalo needs to wash away the foul taste of that one-point loss to Philadelphia, plus the Bills want to turn off the lights at Highmark Stadium in style. Should be pretty lopsided.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nTalk about coming full circle. This will feel like an exhibition game. Better buy a program so you can figure out who’s on the field. The Chiefs have a better roster, and they feed the ball at Travis Kelce early and often. Disappointing seasons for a pair of future Hall of Fame coaches.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nLine: Patriots by 10½. O/U: 45½.\n\nThe No. 1 seed is within reach for the Patriots. The Dolphins are playing for pride and individual contract incentives. Barring a bizarre twist, this one is pretty straight-forward. Mike Vrabel has his New England players ready to enter the playoffs on a roll — and in the frosty cold.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Eagles and Bears kick off at the same time, so Philadelphia will have to play hard in case it can move up for that No. 2 seed. Washington put up something of a fight when these teams met two weeks ago. Philadelphia is prone to offensive lapses, though, so this might not be a blowout.\n\nSunday, 5:20 p.m. TV: NBC, Peacock.\n\nIt’s winner-take-all in the AFC North. Judging by their performances last week, the Ravens should win going away. But that’s not how this rivalry works. These games are almost always super close, and Pittsburgh rarely loses at home to Baltimore. Aaron Rodgers comes through.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Mile High Report’s Christopher Hart gives his picks for Week 18 of the 2025 NFL regular season.",
    "fullText": "Week 18 of the NFL regular season is finally here. I was 10-6 with my Week 17 picks. With just sixteen games left, I’m 170-86 on the season. That’s over 65-percent accuracy which is quite good, but far below my 70-percent average from last season. Let’s see how well I do for the final week of regular season games.\n\nSaturday Football (Afternoon Game) — Carolina Panthers at Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nWith the Atlanta Falcons upsetting the Los Angeles Rams on Monday Night Football, the Buccaneers’ path to the postseason had a wrench thrown int. They must now win and have the New Orleans Saints defeat the Atlanta Falcons to secure the NFC South and earn a playoff berth. That’s unfortunate news for them. Can they finally end their four-game win streak and do their part to get to the postseason? I think so.\n\nSaturday Football (Night Game) — Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers\n\nThis NFC West heavyweight matchup is for the division title and the number one seed in the NFC. Both of these teams have defied the odds and impressed all season. This is going to be a must-watch game for all football fans. The 49ers inched out a close victory in their first matchup in Week 1. I expect this will be another close game. I’ve got the 49ers finding a way to gut this key game out in front of a hometown crowd.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — New Orleans Saints at Atlanta Falcons\n\nBoth the Saints and Falcons have reeled off multi-game winning streaks after starting off the season horribly. As mentioned above, Tampa Bay fans are desperately hoping the Saints finish the season off on a high note and earn their fifth-straight victory. And guess what? I’m predicting that to happen. Based on my picks, the Buccaneers are in the playoffs as the NFC South champions.\n\nSunday Football (Earl Game) — Cleveland Browns at Cincinnati Bengals\n\nThe Browns were able to upset the Pittsburgh Steelers and play spoiler last weekend. I don’t expect them to have the same success against the Bengals, who have notched back-to-back wins with impressive offensive performances. I’ve got Cincinnati at home in this one.\n\n\"That was sick.\"\n\nMic'd Up | @altafiber pic.twitter.com/L23CO3bMBo\n\n— Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) December 31, 2025\n\nSaturday Football (Evening Game) — Green Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe Packers have dropped three in a row. Luckily, they already punched their postseason ticket. Meanwhile, the Vikings are riding a four-game winning streak. I’m not sure if the Packers are expected to rest players or not. They are the seven seed in the NFC regardless of the outcome. My bet is that is the case. With that in mind, I’ll take Minnesota at home.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Dallas Cowboys at New York Giants\n\nAnother game, another division rivalry matchup. With the Giants beating the Las Vegas Raiders last week, they find themselves on the outside looking in with respect to the #1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Cowboys? Out of the playoffs for the second season in a row. Even so, I’ve still got Dallas winning this one.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Tennessee Titans at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nThere are some ways the Jaguars can still be the #1 seed in the AFC. That seems improbable. With a win against the Titans, they will be the AFC South champions and get to host a playoff game. I feel confident that scenario will happen.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans\n\nAfter a rough start to the year, DeMeco Ryans and the Texans have really done well down the stretch. Their defense has been the strength of their team that has carried them all season long. I’m predicting a win at home, which will likely lock them in as the #5 seed in the AFC playoff race.\n\nSafe to say we were all feeling the same way as Coach 😅\n\n🤘 | #SonyPartner pic.twitter.com/RV3lcloW0P\n\n— Houston Texans (@HoustonTexans) December 31, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — New York Jets at Buffalo Bills\n\nA failed two-point conversion attempt at the end of last week’s game officially kicked the Bills out of contending for the AFC East title. That belongs to the New England Patriots. Regardless, I think they will find a way to beat the Jets who’ve been awful the entire season. I’m taking Buffalo at home.\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Detroit Lions at Chicago Bears\n\nWith the Bears losing to the 49ers, they have no shot at the #1 seed in the NFC. They are assured the second or third seed no matter what happens in this game. Some thought Ben Johnson might rest his players, but he stated earlier in the week they are playing to win—indicating the starters will be a go for Sunday’s division rivalry game against the Lions. Division games are always tough, and the Lions are a gritty team, but I think the Bears find a way to end the season off with a big victory. I’m taking Chicago.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — Kansas City Chiefs at Las Vegas Raiders\n\nIt makes my heart smile the Chiefs and Raiders have had down seasons. I don’t really care who wins this game. I’m taking Kansas City here which will officially gift the Raiders the #1 pick next April.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Los Angeles Chargers at Denver Broncos\n\nThe Chargers and Broncos are both in the playoffs. Los Angeles will be a wild card team, but the Broncos can earn the AFC’s top seed, first-round bye and homefield advantage by taking down their rivals in front of Broncos Country on Sunday. That’s a result I’m hoping for and believe will happen. Obviously, I’m taking Denver.\n\nThrowing it 🔙 at @EmpowerField this Sunday 😤 pic.twitter.com/W6u2xonlyU\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 30, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Miami Dolphins at New England Patriots\n\nIf the Patriots beat the Dolphins and the Broncos lose to the Chargers, New England will be the top seed in the AFC. With that at stake, they will certainly be playing their starters. I believe Drake Maye, who might even be the front runner for MVP honors, is going to have another huge game and deliver the Patriots their fourteen victory of the season.\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Arizona Cardinals at Los Angeles Rams\n\nAfter their last second loss to the Falcons, the Rams are now relegated to being either the fifth or sixth seed in the NFC. Bummer for them. Whether they rest their starters or not, I think they defeat the Cardinals who have dropped eight games in a row. I’m picking Los Angeles.\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Washington Commanders at Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Eagles will be the second or third seed in the NFC no matter what happens here. They still have the perks of being the NFC East division winners and get to host a playoff game. The rumor is they may rest some starters. Even so, I think they beat Washington who’ve looked terrible for the entire season.\n\nSunday Night Football — Baltimore Ravens at Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nThe Steelers had a chance to make the playoffs and secure the AFC North division title had they beat the Browns last weekend. Unfortunately, they didn’t rise to the occasion and lost to the lowly Browns. That sets up a primetime matchup in Week 18 against the Baltimore Ravens. Baltimore was able to outduel the Green Bay Packers in Week 17. The Ravens are expected to have Lamar Jackson and a few players back for this game. It’ll be a tough go of it on the road, but I think Baltimore is poised to come back and win the division. Pretty impressive given how bad they were earlier in the season.",

    "fullText": "Going into the final week of the regular season, the Denver Broncos (13-3) are tied with the best record in the NFL, and they currently hold the AFC's No. 1 playoff seed.\n\nOverall, the Broncos are a well-balanced team with the NFL's fourth-best scoring defense and the AFC's seventh-best scoring offense. If there's one area where coach Sean Payton's squad is taking, it's takeaways.\n\nDenver ranks 25th in the league with a -5 turnover differential. If the Broncos are going to make a deep run in the NFL playoffs, that number has to improve.\n\n\"The one area that has to improve is the turnover margin, and that can happen,\" Payton said. \"We did a collective of the last 25 years of Super Bowl winners. It’s something like 114 in the plus. There’s been one Super Bowl winner in the last 25 years [in the negative] -- I’m just talking about when the playoffs begin, if that makes sense. When the playoffs begin, the Rams recently were the only minus-two turnover team. The rest added up to some crazy number, and so that’s something we have to improve on.”\n\nDenver has 17 giveaways this season (11 interceptions and six lost fumbles), which ranks 13th-best. A more concerning total is just 12 takeaways (nine interceptions and three fumbles), which ranks fifth-worst in the NFL. In addition to protecting the football, the Broncos need to force more takeaways. If they don't, the odds will be against them as they seek a fourth Super Bowl title.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Sean Payton reveals key area Broncos must improve in playoffs",

For the first time in his NFL career, the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback is preparing for a Week 18 start knowing that no matter what, the season ends on Sunday.  The Bengals made it to the Super Bowl in 2021 and the AFC championship game in ’22 along with being in contention for a playoff spot up until the last game in 2024.",
    "fullText": "CINCINNATI (AP) — Joe Burrow is in unfamiliar territory.\n\nFor the first time in his NFL career, the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback is preparing for a Week 18 start knowing that no matter what, the season ends on Sunday.\n\nBurrow was injured in 2020 and ‘23. The Bengals made it to the Super Bowl in 2021 and the AFC championship game in ’22 along with being in contention for a playoff spot up until the last game in 2024.\n\n“Obviously, you want to win a Super Bowl, you want to win MVPs, you want to be in the playoffs every year,” Burrow said. “My goals at this point are just going out and playing as good as I can and continuing to improve, finding ways to continue to be great and continue to find self improvement.”\n\nThe Bengals (6-10) close out the season on Sunday at home against the Cleveland Browns (4-12). While the Bengals defense has struggled this season, Burrow also missed more than half of the season because of a toe injury that required surgery.\n\nDuring the offseason, as Burrow works to get stronger, the front office will also need to strengthen the roster. Burrow said that he has a great line of communication with the front office and ownership.\n\n“I think my job is to No. 1, play as well as I can. No. 2, continue to improve, and No. 3, be the conduit between coaching staff, front office and the locker room,” Burrow said. “Relay feelings that players have, relay sentiments in the locker room because coaches and front office, they aren’t down there every day and they don’t understand a lot of the things that go on in the locker room. I think (as a) quarterback, your job is to relay some of those things.”\n\nFollowing three years where the Bengals have missed the postseason, Burrow said that there will need to be some changes for the Bengals to get back to contention in the AFC.\n\nBut unlike last season, when he stumped for re-signing players such as Tee Higgins and Mike Gesicki, Burrow is speaking \n\n“We want to be competing for championships every year,” Burrow said. “We don’t want to be in the spot we are in now, so something’s got to change, whether it’s players we have continuing to improve and get better and play championship-caliber football, or bringing in guys that will or whatever it may be.”\n\nRight now, Burrow’s main focus is preparing for a vaunted Browns’ defense and preparing for one of the top pass rushers in Myles Garrett. Burrow has been sacked 11 times by Garrett in nine meetings.\n\nGarrett is one sack away from setting the single-season record for sacks. While that presents a big challenge, the Bengals also have one of their best offensive lines in years. Because of the development of right tackle Amarius Mims and left guard Dylan Fairchild, the Browns will see a much-improved Bengals’ offensive line than what they faced in Week 1.\n\n“I think they’re playing exponentially better than they were at the time,” Burrow said. “I know they’re excited about the challenge, but I know (the Browns’) front is tough to deal with, starting with (Garrett). They have a lot of other guys, too, that can be very challenging to handle up front. I know they’re excited for it.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Jets are 3-13 and in the middle of a very rough 2025 season. Aaron Glenn's first year as head coach has, to say the least, been a major disappointment.\n\nBut will the Jets move on from him after just one season? It's been a question at the forefront of many fans' minds, thanks to the brutal 0-4, negative 107 point differential, December, the Jets are coming out of.\n\nAccording to Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated, the Jets have a clear plan in place for Glenn beyond the 2025 season. Unfortunately for any fans hoping the Jets cut ties with Glenn, there haven't been any discussions of that nature this season.\n\n\"Here's the reality of the Jets' situation:\" Breer reports, \"There has been no discussion at the upper reaches of the organization about moving on from Aaron Glenn after one year.\"\n\nDespite a rough 2025 season and very little optimism on the roster with so many holes to fill, the Jets organization doesn't plan to cut ties with Glenn after one year.\n\nIn fact, Breer's report suggests that no such conversations have even been happening. Woody Johnson and the Jets organization aren't giving up on Glenn just yet.\n\nMore: Jets expected to make 'significant' roster moves in offseason on defense\n\nEven if the Jets turn in another rough Week 18 showing against the Buffalo Bills, the Jets aren't planning to move on from Glenn after the 2025 season.\n\nJustin Fields was a major miss, and the Jets' front office, led by Darren Mougey, traded away multiple key defenders for a huge return of draft capital.\n\nThis Jets rebuild was never going to be a one-year fix. And it might not even be fixed in 2026 either. The Jets need to be patient, and for now, that looks to be the case in giving Glenn another year at least to figure things out.\n\nBreece Hall makes history despite Jets commanding loss\n\nAaron Glenn questions Jets’ effort after Week 17 blowout to Patriots\n\nWhy Jets benefit from Patriots' Morgan Moses earning $1.5 million incentive\n\nHow Jets' Aaron Glenn can follow Kyle Shanahan, Dan Campbell coaching paths\n\nNFL history doesn't bode well for Aaron Glenn amid Jets' 3-win season",

    "title": "2026 NFL Draft: 12 prospects to watch in Miami vs. Ohio State playoff",
    "description": "Which 2026 NFL Draft prospects the Detroit Lions should be watching on New Year’s Eve.",
    "fullText": "With the Detroit Lions eliminated from the 2025-26 playoffs, many fans have turned their attention to the offseason—and for many, that means turning their attention to the NFL Draft. Whether you’re just getting into the process or have been studying this draft class all year, the College Football Playoffs are an excellent opportunity to watch several of this year’s top prospects, while also consuming some entertaining football.\n\nOne of the most intriguing games in the College Football Playoff is Miami vs. Ohio State on December 31, 2025, at 7:30 p.m. ET. This game features a plethora of players that should interest the Lions based on projected needs and schematic fits.\n\nSo, let’s take a look at a dozen players Lions’ fans should be paying attention to.\n\nDetroit will enter the offseason looking to add talent to its offensive line, and depending on a few potential retirements, the Lions may need to replace multiple starters or secure future starters, both at tackle and on the interior.\n\nTop prospect: Francis Mauigoa, RT, Miami (6-foot-6, 325)\n\nOne of the most talented and consistent offensive tackle prospects in this draft class, Mauigoa should be a plug-and-play right tackle in the NFL, though it’s also being reported that some teams like him inside at guard as well. The Lions should very much have Mauigoa on their radar in the first round, regardless of how their offensive line shakes out this offseason.\n\nAustin Siereveid, LT, Ohio State (6-foot-5, 325) is a redshirt sophomore who is expected to return to school, but could surprise. With experience at LT, LG, and RG, he’s a talent on the rise.\n\nAnez Cooper, RG, Miami (6-foot-6, 347) is a three-year starter at right guard with the size and power to fit the Lions’ scheme. Likely a Day 3 prospect who could rise with a good offseason.\n\nWhile the best edge player in this game most certainly is Arvell Reese (LB/ED, Ohio State, 6-foot-4, 240), it would be surprising if the Lions were within striking distance to get this hybrid demon. A Micah Parsons/Frankie Luvu/Kyle Van Noy-type of player, Reese would completely change the Lions’ defense if they traded up to acquire him.\n\nMore than likely, the Lions will stick with a more traditional edge player, which leads up to…\n\nTop prospect: Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-foot-2, 277)\n\nBain has first-round talent, but his body type doesn’t match what NFL teams typically look for on the edge. He is shorter than most and lacks the desired length. However, for the Lions, his body type isn’t too far away from Josh Paschal’s (6-foot-2 1/2, 270) — though Bain’s arms are quite a bit shorter. In addition to his pass rush promise, Bain also has the positional range to move up and down the defensive line.\n\nAkheem Mesidor, EDGE, Miami (6-foot-2 1/2, 273) starts on the opposite edge from Bain but offers a similar skill set and maybe even more positional range. Mesidor is even closer to a Paschal-like clone and could end up making his living in the NFL as a 3-technique.\n\nKenyatta Jackson, Jr., EDGE, Ohio State (6-foot-6, 260) plays a lot of 4i in the Buckeyes’ scheme, which is easily translatable to the current Lions scheme, and why the Lions drafted Tyleik Williams out of Ohio State in the first round last year. Jackson could be an option for the Lions on Day 2.\n\nWith Alex Anzalone on an expiring contract—and coming off a recent contract dispute with the Lions—Detroit may be in the market to find a starting WILL linebacker.\n\nTop prospect: Sonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-foot-4, 238)\n\nA freaky athlete that would be a plug-and-play WILL linebacker, but would likely cost the Lions a first-round pick to acquire, but his upside is Jack Campbell-esque.\n\nWesley Bissainthe, LB, Miami (6-foot-2, 226) is a four-year contributor for the Hurricanes with appealing coverage traits. He’s not a complete package for most NFL teams, but there’s enough to get him drafted, and he has the skills to carve out a specialty role at the next level.\n\nThe Lions will enter the offseason with a potential starting slot/nickel role to fill (Amik Robertson is a pending free agent), as well as needing a starting-level safety (or two) to carry the load while Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph recover from injuries.\n\nThe out-of-the-box prospect: Caleb Downs (SAF, Ohio State, 6-foot-0, 205).\n\nOne of the most complete and reliable football players in this draft class, Downs can play two-deep, drop into the box as a rover, play over the slot, rarely misses tackles, and is a dynamic playmaker. There is an argument to be made that Downs is the most talented player in this draft class, but with the NFL not valuing the safety position, he could slide into the Lions’ range. For as much responsibility as the Lions put on their safeties, there’s an argument to be made that they can’t pass up a player with his talents, and when Branch and Joseph return, you live in three-safety sets.\n\nStarting NB: Keionte Scott, DB/NB, Miami (5-foot-11, 195)\n\nEvery year, I tend to fall in love with a defensive back (Devon Witherspoon in 2023, Mike Sainristil in 2024, and Malaki Starks in 2025). This year, Scott is closing in on that title. While he’ll be listed as a corner in most draft guides, I see him as a starting nickel, who is more likely to be cross-trained at safety rather than at outside corner. Aggressive, hits like a linebacker, closes with conviction, and is a more than capable blitzer, Scott is an exciting prospect to watch.\n\nWhile adding to the running back room would be a luxury, I also believe you can’t have enough talented running backs, especially with the way the new special teams rules are designed in the NFL.\n\nSleeper prospect: Mark Fletcher Jr., RB, Miami (6-foot-2, 225)\n\nA bruising downhill runner with experience in multiple blocking schemes, he’s productive both on the ground and in the passing game. If available on Day 3, he’d be a solid complement piece in the Lions running back room, would challenge Jacob Saylors for a reserve power role with the potential to be a David Montgomery replacement a few years down the road.",

    "title": "Secret Superstars 2025: Xavier Watts keeps proving the NFL wrong",
    "description": "The NFL let Notre Dame safety Xavier Watts fall to the third round of the 2025 draft. The Atlanta Falcons couldn’t be happier about that.",
    "fullText": "Throughout the 2025 NFL season, SB Nation’s Doug Farrar writes about the game’s Secret Superstars — those players whose performances might slip under the radar for whatever reasons. In this installment, we focus on Atlanta Falcons rookie safety Xavier Watts, who was ignored by the NFL until the third round of the 2025 draft. The Falcons couldn’t believe that, and now, they feel quite blessed that the rest of the league let them pick Watts off as he’s picked opponents off… especially against the Rams on Monday night.\n\nWhen you’re a draft analyst, there are times when you have absolutely no idea what the NFL is thinking. There are times when a prospect has all the tape, all the metrics, and all the potential to be a first-round talent in the pros, and for whatever reason, the pros don’t agree.\n\nThis was the case in my pre-draft analysis of Notre Dame safety Xavier Watts. The safety position in the 2025 draft was basically a three-man race to the top with Watts, Georgia’s Malaki Starks, and South Carolina’s Nick Emmanwori as the primary guys, and it just depended on which type of defender you preferred. Emmanwori went to the Seattle Seahawks with the 35th overall pick in the second round to be head coach Mike Macdonald’s new Kyle Hamilton (Macdonald had helped Hamilton become what he is as Baltimore’s defensive coordinator in 2022 and 2023), and that’s worked out pretty well so far. Starks went to the Ravens with the 27th overall pick in the first round, and he’s played well for the most part.\n\nWatts, who I believed to be the best deep-third safety in this class by a fairly wide margin — and if you don’t have a credible deep-third safety in today’s NFL, your defense is utterly hosed — somehow lasted until the 96th pick in the third round.\n\nBased on his college performance, this made less than no sense to me.\n\nMaybe the NFL saw Watts as a tweener at 5’11¾” and 204 pounds. Or perhaps his 4.58-second 40-yard dash and 1.58-second 10-yard split scared people off. But this was a guy coming off a killer season in a major program, and he was shutting down some of the NCAA’s best passing games. In 2024, Watts allowed 17 catches on 32 targets for 179 yards, 115 yards after the catch, no touchdowns, six interceptions, four pass breakups, and an opponent passer rating of 30.1. This after a 2023 season in which he allowed 19 catches on 32 targets for 198 yards, 88 yards after the catch, no touchdowns, seven interceptions, and an opponent passer rating of 37.8. And as a deep safety last season (67% of his overall snaps), Watts picked off as many passes (four) as he allowed catches.\n\nI don’t know what more the NFL needed to see, but new Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich was more than happy to profit from this major miscalculation.\n\nXavier Watts in four seasons at Notre Dame: 1 TD allowed (in 2022!), 13 interceptions, 10 pass breakups, and an opponent passer rating of 41.9. This guy will deny enemy quarterbacks from anywhere and everywhere on the field. Slot, single-high, two-deep, you name it. pic.twitter.com/KpoAQ9p0av\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) March 31, 2025\n\n“It’s funny, you create these clusters of players at every position and, and obviously you have needs, and best on board, and there’s a lot of things that go into this,” Ulbrich said after the Watts pick. “When I kept putting my safety cluster together, we were looking at this third to fourth round as kind of like the honey-hole for that. To tell you the truth, I didn’t even put Watts on it, because I had him as a second-round guy, and I thought he was going to be long gone. If we had had our second, he would have definitely been part of that conversation. The fact that we didn’t have that second anymore, I thought he was out of the conversation, and then he ends up being there.”\n\nWatts was just as happy to be there, as he had patterned his overall game on Jessie Bates III, who would now be a teammate and mentor.\n\n“I’m really excited to be teammates with him,” Watts said of Bates post-draft. “I just think we’re very similar. We’re similar in size. He gets the ball. He’s a playmaker. He can tackle well. So, I feel like we’re very similar in all aspects of the game of football.”\n\nAfter the Falcons’ 27-24 win over the Los Angeles Rams on Monday night, we’re guessing that everybody is even happier that Watts lasted as long as he did in the draft. In that game, Watts picked off two of Matthew Stafford’s passes, and while he did allow two big-play receptions (weirdly enough, two 27-yard catches by fellow rookie Terence Ferguson, the Rams’ outstanding tight end from Oregon), if you kill as many drives as you help sustain, anybody will take that ratio.\n\nWeirdness from Xavier Watts: The only two catches he allowed against the Rams on Monday night were two 27-yard plays to TE Terrance Ferguson. Go figure. pic.twitter.com/G98LlEdJsH\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) December 30, 2025\n\nWatts’ two interceptions were another matter. The first came with 1:48 left in the first half, and Watts was in the deep third, taking receiver Xavier Smith upfield in Cover-3. The Falcons did a nice job of disguising their intentions, as it looked like two-deep pre-snap, but Bates came down to rob the hook/curl area, and Watts used his open-field speed to take the ball away. This was an excellent combination of athleticism and acumen.\n\nXavier Watts' first pick against the Rams. This could be MOFC or MOFO pre-snap, but it becomes Cover-3, and Watts reads the vert to Xavier Smith all the way. A little Xavier-on-Xavier crime. LB Kaden Elliss also does a great job downfield. pic.twitter.com/qhLkMZwiTU\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) December 30, 2025\n\nThe second Watts pick came with 9:13 left in the game — this was fourth-and-2 from the Atlanta 27-yard line, and the Falcons up 24-17. This was also Cover-3, but Bates was the deep safety this time, while Watts was in the box, waiting to jump on Stafford’s in-cut to Ferguson. Here’s where Watts got his own back against his most formidable opponent on the night, and he nearly ran this one back. Again, the Falcons threw a wrinkle at Stafford — when cornerback Dee Alford followed Xavier Smith’s pre-snap motion, that was a man coverage tell… and then, it wasn’t. It’s possible that Stafford thought it was man coverage, and Watts might follow Smith on the vertical seam bender. As it turned out, Smith was completely uncovered upfield, but it mattered not.\n\nXavier Watts' second interception against the Rams. Falcons give a man tell with a motion follow, flip to zone, and Watts jumps the quick in to Terrance Ferguson. More advanced defensive tactics. pic.twitter.com/pnhI4h0jYC\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) December 30, 2025\n\nWatts was also ready with the truck stick when necessary.\n\nWatts man wow pic.twitter.com/vzKBH8YWu9\n\n— Irish Muse (@NdMuse) December 30, 2025\n\nNow, Watts has the most interceptions for a Falcons rookie since Deion Sanders’ five in 1989, and there are likely a whole lot of NFL shot-callers who are re-discussing their evaluations of Watts as the draft came around.\n\n“Yeah, that’s little bro right there,” Bates said of Watts after the Rams game. “Just to watch him come in and how urgent – he was able to pick up on things. To see it translate to the field, I knew it throughout training camp, through OTAs, the way that he could process installs and stuff like that. I’m just proud of him. I’m proud of him for sure.”\n\nHead coach Raheem Morris was twice as happy about his two safeties.\n\n“Two game ball winners today. Obviously, Jessie, he’s been that way since he’s been in the league. He touches the football, scores points, makes big-time plays. He did it today. And his young counterpart, Xavier Watts, has continued to show up throughout the course of the year and just get better and better, and play at a very high level.”\n\nThe NFL’s blunder is the Falcons’ gain, and that should continue to play itself out as Xavier Watts continues to grow and develop into the true defensive force he already was.",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns are less than one week away from deciding on the future of head coach Kevin Stefanski.\n\nAfter six seasons as the head coach in Cleveland, many have thoughts on his status with the franchise. With just seven wins in two seasons as well, there is reason to believe his time in Northeast Ohio might be coming to an end.\n\nSo what is next for Stefanski? ESPN's Jeremy Fowler has a few ideas. Speaking about the future of the current Cleveland head coach, the NFL insider has stated that he expects Stefanski to be considered for other vacant head coaching jobs around the league.\n\nSpecifically, Fowler names the New York Giants as a team that may strongly inquire about Stefanski's services if he finds himself as a free agent after the 2025 season concludes. Here is what Fowler had to say on the Browns' current head coach:\n\n\"Cleveland is a spot people are keeping an eye on, with the idea that Kevin Stefanski could be a head coach candidate elsewhere if the Browns do move on... Stefanski might be the strongest retread candidate in the eyes of many. The Giants would be an ideal fit.\"\n\nStefanski does have two NFL Coach of the Year awards under his belt, and that is sure to count for something.\n\nOne interesting aspect to keep an eye on, however, is that Stefanski would be due a buyout from the Browns if he were fired. Coaches have to surrender that buyout, however, if they take a coordinator position or another head coaching job the following season. This is why Mike Vrabel, fresh off his firing from the Tennessee Titans, took a role as a consultant with the Browns. He still got his hands dirty, and he still maintained the contractual obligations of his buyout.\n\nIf Stefanski is fired, would Vrabel perhaps return the favor before the two-time NFL Coach of the Year looks for another job in 2027?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns HC Kevin Stefanski might not be free agent for long if fired",

    "description": "The New York Giants are looking ahead to the 2026 NFL draft and here are some prospects they should scout during the New Year's Eve bowl games.",
    "fullText": "On New Year's Eve -- Wednesday -- bowl season kicks into high gear with five games, including the Cotton Bowl Classic, a College Football Playoff matchup. All 32 teams will have eyes on these games, including the New York Giants, who will have a top-7 pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants could still climb up to No. 1 overall and are likely to trade down for additional draft assets should they pick somewhere in the top-3. Despite rumors and speculation, it's doubtful they target a quarterback with Jaxson Dart, a 2025 first-round pick, under center.\n\nWith limited games remaining, Giants scouts have one final major opportunity to evaluate top prospects in live game settings.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the players the Giants should key in on today.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker\n\nAlthough the Giants' offensive line improved in 2025, they still have some issues along the interior. Greg Van Roten is an impending free agent, and the team has an out in Jon Runyan Jr.'s contract should they decide to move on.\n\nWith that in mind, Gennings Dunker could intrigue them as a potential late-second-round pick.\n\nHere's what Bleacher Report had to say about Dunker:\n\nGennings Dunker is a rugged, powerful in-line blocker built with the right stuff, but will need to kick inside to guard to mitigate his middling movement skills. He has the traits to carve out a role and crack a lineup on his rookie deal in a run-first, play-action-heavy offense.\n\nDunker is a 6'5\", 315-pound offensive line prospect, who entered the Iowa program as a 3-star recruit in the 2021 class.\n\nDunker started 11 games in 2024 at right tackle, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors. He started 11 games at RT during the '23 season and one in '22 at right guard.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Texas tight end Jack Endries\n\nMichigan is a mess right now due to various off-field reasons, but that doesn't mean it will be devoid of prospect talent on Wednesday. The opt-outs on both sides will hurt, but there's still something to watch for.\n\nWhile the Giants don't necessarily need a tight end, they could look for some depth in the mid-rounds, and Jack Endries is an intriguing option.\n\nHere's what NFL Draft Buzz had to say about Endries:\n\nWhat separates Endries from typical move tight ends is his football instincts and technical refinement rather than raw athleticism. He finds soft spots in coverage with veteran-like instincts and has eliminated the concentration drops that plagued his freshman season, but his modest frame and average speed ceiling prevent him from becoming a true mismatch weapon against NFL athletes.\n\nEndries represents the modern evolution of the position where receiving ability often outweighs traditional tight end responsibilities, but his blocking limitations create roster construction challenges that could affect his draft stock. His consistent production and technical soundness suggest he'll find a role somewhere in the middle rounds, yet the inability to contribute meaningfully in run support may cap his upside as anything more than a situational contributor.\n\nMichigan RB Justice Haynes (may not play)\n\nGame notes: Michigan linebackers Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham, offensive lineman Gio El-Hadi, have opted out of this game. Meanwhile, Texas had 12 players enter the transfer portal, and several more opted out of this game. There are too many to list, so keep track here.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese\n\nThis is the big game of the day and one that will be heavily attended by NFL scouts. What makes it more notable for the Giants is that several top-end talents will fall right into their range (from No. 1 to No. 7) -- most of whom play positions of need. Moreover, several have already been mocked to the Giants.\n\nGiants Wire has covered safety Caleb Downs quite a bit, so we went with linebacker Arvell Reese in the player spotlight instead.\n\nHere's what Mel Kiper Jr. had to say about Reese:\n\nThis is a complete football player. Reese jumps off the Ohio State tape, playing the game like a veteran. I see natural instincts at the linebacker position that allow him to make plays most guys just can't make, and he has the burst to get home when turned loose as a pass rusher. Reese has been a big riser in this class.\n\nArizona State TE Chamon Metayer\n\nGame notes: Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson, cornerback Keith Abne, offensive lineman Max Iheanachor, and running back Raleek Brown won't play. Duke corner back Chandler Rivers, offensive lineman Brian Parker, and edge rusher Vincent Anthony will also sit out.\n\nGame notes: Utah offensive linemen Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu, and edge rushers John Henry Daley and Logan Fano will not play in this game. Nebraska running back Emmett Johnson Jr. will also sit this one out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Prospects Giants should watch during New Year's Eve bowl games",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Saints quarterback Drew Brees is on a fast track to the Pro Football Hall of Fame — and few would argue otherwise.\n\nThe Super Bowl XLIV champion was named one of the 15 finalists for the Class of 2026, placing him one step away from enshrinement in Canton.\n\nThe Hall’s 50-member selection committee will vote on the finalists next month, with the results announced Feb. 5 during “NFL Honors.” Under the current format, between three and five modern-era finalists will be inducted, marking the second year of the revised process.\n\nBrees’ résumé is among the strongest in NFL history. He ranks second all-time to Tom Brady with 80,358 passing yards and 571 touchdown passes. After spending the first five seasons of his career with the San Diego Chargers, Brees signed with New Orleans in 2006 — a move that changed both his career and the franchise’s trajectory.\n\nHe became the face of a city rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina and ultimately led the Saints to their first Super Bowl title following the 2009 season, earning Super Bowl MVP honors in a win over Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nOver his career, Brees was selected to 13 Pro Bowls, won AP Offensive Player of the Year twice (2008, 2011), earned first-team All-Pro honors in 2006 and was named second-team All-Pro four times.\n\nJoining Brees as finalists are first-year eligibles Larry Fitzgerald, Jason Witten and Frank Gore. Willie Anderson, Torry Holt, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri earned automatic finalist status after advancing to the final seven for the Class of 2025.\n\nReturning finalists include Eli Manning, Reggie Wayne, Jahri Evans, Marshal Yanda, Terrell Suggs and Darren Woodson, while defensive tackle Kevin Williams reached the finalist stage for the first time in his sixth year of eligibility.\n\nThe committee will also consider senior candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood, along with coach Bill Belichick and contributor Robert Kraft. Between one and three of those candidates will be inducted.\n\nOnly four people were inducted last year, making it the smallest Hall of Fame class in the past 20 years.",

But he has a history of overseeing explosive offenses, particularly at the college level.\n\nKelly led Oregon to a 46-7 record and a national championship game appearance from 2009 to 2012 before spending four years as an NFL head coach — three with Philadelphia and one with San Francisco. He returned to the college ranks as UCLA’s coach from 2018-23, leading the Bruins to a 35–34 record. He was offensive coordinator at Ohio State under Ryan Day last year, helping the Buckeyes win the national championship.\n\n“This program and university are clearly on the rise, and the values of the people and this place align with my own,” he said in a statement. “I am grateful for the opportunity. There is tremendous potential under Coach Braun’s leadership, and I’m ready to contribute to this team.”\n\nKelly was the most prominent assistant hired by Pete Carroll in his first season as Las Vegas' coach after leading the Seattle Seahawks for 14 years. He reportedly received a $6 million contract, the highest for an NFL offensive coordinator. But he never lived up to the deal. Las Vegas' offense ranked among the NFL's worst when he was fired.\n\nEven so, Northwestern coach David Braun called hiring Kelly “a program-defining change” that “is reflective of our long-term commitment to the pursuit of championships\" in a statement.\n\nThe Wildcats are 19-19 in three seasons under Braun. They went 7-6 this year and beat Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl.\n\nNorthwestern is set to move into a new stadium next season after playing home games the past two years at a temporary lakefront facility and at Wrigley Field.\n\n\"This is a seminal moment for our program under David Braun’s direction and another indication that we are prepared to pursue the highest standard of excellence in all that we do,” athletic director Mark Jackson said in a statement.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Diggs' lawyers petitioned to move the arraignment to March, though she has not yet made a ruling.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the Matthew Stafford vs. Drake Maye MVP debate\n\nThe NFL typically waits until legal cases are resolved before issuing suspensions, which is why Kansas City Chiefs WR Rashee Rice wasn't suspended until 2025 for an incident that occurred in March 2024.\n\nAs long as that precedent stands, there isn't any reason to expect Diggs to be suspended by the league at any point this season.\n\nThe only exception could be a scenario in which Diggs is placed on the Commissioner's Exempt List, which the NFL describes as \"a special player status available to clubs only in unusual circumstances.\" Use of the Commissioner's Exempt List is rare, but it can allow a player to not count against a team's 53-man roster while facing serious criminal charges.\n\nAt this time, there is no reason to believe the NFL is considering placing Diggs on the Commissioner's Exempt List, meaning he is eligible to continue playing.\n\nThe Patriots issued a statement on Tuesday addressing the charges against Diggs:\n\n\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs. Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.”\n\nThe NFL also released a statement saying the league is aware of the matter and will not comment further.",

    "description": "On an eight-game win streak, are the Texans among the top five teams in the NFL entering Saturday's afternoon bout against the Chargers?",
    "fullText": "On an eight-game win streak with victories over four potential playoff rosters, are the Houston Texans among the top three teams entering this weekend's regular-season finale?\n\nNope. Instead, it's another week of losing ground at the worst time possible.\n\nNope. Instead, Houston moves outside the top five because of a close call against a bad roster.\n\nFresh off a 20-16 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, the Texans sit at 11-5 and are officially back in the playoffs. They're still a half-game out of first place, but bolstering the league's No. 1 defense in total yards and scoring has made the case for them as perhaps the most complete roster in the AFC South.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars, who can clinch the division title on Sunday with a win over the Titans, still own the AFC South. A loss would take them out of the conversation should Houston win, but a win could clinch home-field advantage with losses by New England and Denver.\n\nAs for the Texans, even though they remain in second place for the division, they once again lost a bit of traction in Nate Davis' latest NFL power rankings for USA TODAY Sports, remaining idle at No. 7 overall.\n\n\"Now on an eight-game heater, their league-best defense − stifling, opportunistic and rude to opposing quarterbacks − should keep them in just about every game. But can an often limited offense, particularly in the run game, hold up its end of the bargain − especially if a franchise that's never reached the AFC title game winds up on the postseason road?\" Davis wrote.\n\nHouston secured an interception on Justin Herbert before halftime behind the return of Azeez Al-Shaair into the starting lineup after missing last week's game against the Las Vegas Raiders. That, along with two missed kicks from Cameron Dicker, were among the many issues that cost Los Angeles a chance as the No. 1 seed in the AFC.\n\nFor Indianapolis, its season went south after the season-ending injury to Daniel Jones. Losing six of their last seven games, the Colts were knocked out of the playoff picture following Houston's win on Saturday. They appeared at No. 21.\n\n\"Nunc Coepi, fellas … just not sure who you're beginning with next,\" Davis wrote.\n\nAcross the AFC South, the Jaguars took a step back after having a close call with the Colts. Yes, they won, but Trevor Lawrence didn't throw a touchdown pass and was limited as a runner outside of two red-zone scores.\n\n\"Why aren't they No. 1 … even though they might wind up there in the overall AFC standings? Their seven-game winning streak, most of those victories of the decisive variety, is currently second only to Houston's. The Jags are committed to the run, take the ball away and can rush the passer. But as well as QB Trevor Lawrence has played since Thanksgiving, he also remains an unproven commodity − at the professional level anyway − when it comes to January football,\" Davis wrote.\n\nAs for the Titans, they remained idle after losing late against the New Orleans Saints. For the first time this season, Cam Ward looked promising, but it was rookie Chimere Dike who earned the accolades from Davis and the Pro Bowl voters.\n\n\"Congratulations to Pro Bowl WR Chimere Dike, who's had a historic rookie season … even if he's not the rookie the Titans had hoped would have a historic season,\" Davis wrote.\n\nElsewhere around the league, the Los Angeles Rams are ranked No. 1 and the Seattle Seahawks are ranked No. 2 as the two leaders toward a Super Bowl run.

    "fullText": "BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:30 GMT). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 21:00 GMT.\n\nThere are just two places left to play for in the NFL play-offs heading into the final week of the season but plenty more to be decided, including both top seeds and four division titles.\n\nThe NFL schedulers have come up trumps as the two remaining play-off spots can be decided in two head-to-head matches.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens renew their fierce rivalry for the AFC North spot and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers need to beat the Carolina Panthers to have a chance of winning the NFC South.\n\nDenver, New England and Jacksonville could all end up as top seeds in the AFC, while the San Francisco 49ers host the Seattle Seahawks in a straight-up fight to claim top spot in the NFC.\n\nStar quarterbacks falter as 49ers eye home Super Bowl - best of week 17\n\n49ers win thriller after Browns upset Steelers - NFL week 17 recap\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (9-7) / Baltimore Ravens (8-8)\n\nThe winner of Pittsburgh against Baltimore will get the fourth seed, with division champions rewarded with a home game in the wildcard round regardless of their record.\n\nBuffalo and Los Angeles are locked in as wildcards while Houston need a win and Jacksonville defeat to jump from fifth to third.\n\nDenver will finish top seed with a win but if they lose then New England or even the Jaguars could pinch that coveted top spot.\n\nCarolina Panthers (8-8) / Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9)\n\nCarolina or Tampa Bay will get the fourth seed and home tie depending on who wins the NFC South, but there's an added wrinkle as the Panthers could lose and still claim the division depending on Atlanta's result.\n\nGreen Bay are locked in seventh and Los Angeles could still get fifth - which when you consider could be the difference between a trip to the Eagles or Panthers/Buccaneers is well worth fighting for.\n\nThat top spot match-up between Seattle and San Francisco is the highlight though, with the difference being a first-round bye and considerable home advantage or having to go on the road being huge in the play-offs.\n\nThe top seed in the NFC and AFC both get a first-round bye and home advantage throughout the play-offs.\n\nThe remaining six teams take part in Wildcard Weekend, with three division winners playing at home against three wildcard teams - the second seed playing seventh, third hosting sixth and fourth facing fifth.\n\nFrom there, the top seeds enter the fray by hosting the lowest remaining seed left, with the next highest seed at home against the next lowest seed in the Divisional Round.\n\nThe Championship games are then contested with again the highest seed remaining hosting the game - which is why finishing in top spot can be so important.\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (01:20, Monday)\n\nThese two teams really do not like each other and they have had some street fights in their time - so a bare knuckle battle for the division will be a brutal ending as the 272nd and final regular season game on the schedule.\n\nBaltimore started 1-5 and have lost three of the past five while the Steelers have been consistently inconsistent all season, yet thanks to an unusually weak division this year one side will make the post-season.\n\nAaron Rodgers almost clinched a play-off return on Sunday but the 42-year-old just couldn't find a late touchdown pass against lowly Cleveland.\n\nMissing dominant receiver DK Metcalf, suspended after an altercation with a fan, could cost Pittsburgh dear.\n\nTwo-time MVP Lamar Jackson is a doubt for Baltimore with a back injury, but running back Derrick Henry exploded for over 200 yards and four touchdowns in his last game.\n\nHenry could be the x-factor here in a straight play-in game - the winner goes to the play-offs, the loser goes home.\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers (01:00, Sunday)\n\nThe NFC West title is up for grabs but more importantly all the trappings of the top seeding as San Francisco host Seattle at Levi's Stadium - which also hosts February's Super Bowl.\n\nIt looks like attack versus defence here with the 49ers the league's top scorers since Brock Purdy returned from injury in week 11, coming off their first back-to-back 40-point games in 30 years.\n\nAnd they need it as without star defenders Fred Warner and Nick Bosa they've also been leaking points - as witnessed during their wild shootout win over Chicago on Sunday.\n\nSeattle's defence is the second best in the NFL with just over 18 points a game allowed and the team moved to 7-1 on the road this season after smothering Carolina on Sunday - allowing Bryce Young to pass for just 54 yards.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is the only man ever to have successive 13-win seasons with two different teams, but he leads the league with 20 turnovers after an interception and fumble in Carolina.\n\nDarnold was in this position last season with Minnesota, but lost in Detroit before having a play-off nightmare against the Rams. He needs to avoid sloppy turnovers to avoid a repeat.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21:30 Saturday)\n\nBaker Mayfield was in the early MVP race but the Buccaneers have fallen off a cliff since with four straight defeats making it seven losses in eight games.\n\nCarolina have also fluffed their lines though when given the chance, so one team will stumble over the line - and not much will be expected of either in the play-offs.\n\nFor the Panthers it is a win-and-in game as victory will book a play-off spot, but not for Tampa Bay as even if Carolina lose they will still take the division if Atlanta beat New Orleans.\n\nThat's because wins for the Bucs and Falcons would see all three teams finish on 8-9 - the first three-way division tie since 2011 - and Carolina hold the best record in head-to-head matches.\n\nTennessee Titans @ Jacksonville Jaguars (18:00, Sunday)\n\nMiami Dolphins @ New England Patriots (21:25, Sunday)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Denver Broncos (21:25, Sunday)\n\nDenver should really get the job done here as Chargers boss Jim Harbaugh has already said he will rest quarterback Justin Herbert and any other starters that need it with a wildcard the best they can do.\n\nThe Broncos have the tiebreaker edge on the Patriots so just need to win, but should Denver stumble, New England can bag top spot with a win over Miami.\n\nJacksonville need to beat the Titans, as they should, and have the Broncos and Patriots both lose to claim an unlikely top seed.\n\nThe Jags will just have to focus on victory though, as they could suffer a big trapdoor fall if they suffer an upset defeat with Houston waiting in the wings.\n\nA Jacksonville loss and Houston victory will give the Texans the AFC South title, third seed and a home play-off tie with the Jags hitting the road as a wildcard.\n\nAll three sides are big favourites to win so things really should stay as they are, but funny things can happen in the NFL.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21:30)\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers (01:00, Sunday)\n\nNew Orleans Saints @ Atlanta Falcons (18:00)\n\nCleveland Browns @ Cincinnati Bengals (18:00)\n\nGreen Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings (18:00)\n\nDallas Cowboys @ New York Giants (18:00)\n\nTennessee Titans @ Jacksonville Jaguars (18:00)\n\nIndianapolis Colts @ Houston Texans (18:00)\n\nNew York Jets @ Buffalo Bills (21:25)\n\nMiami Dolphins @ New England Patriots (21:25)\n\nDetroit Lions @ Chicago Bears (21:25)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Denver Broncos (21:25)\n\nKansas City Chiefs @ Las Vegas Raiders (21:25)\n\nArizona Cardinals @ Los Angeles Rams (21:25)\n\nWashington Commanders @ Philadelphia Eagles (21:25)\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (01:20, Monday)",

    "description": "Notre Dame football got great news on Monday as head coach Marcus Freeman won’t entertain NFL offers, and here are the top social media reactions.",
    "fullText": "It was a huge Monday for Notre Dame football, as head coach Marcus Freeman turned down the NFL to stay in South Bend.\n\nThere were multiple rumors about teams going after the Irish head coach, especially after the disappointing end to the year with missing the College Football Playoff. In the end, Freeman never reportedly took an interview and will continue his quest to win a championship for Notre Dame.\n\nIt can’t be understated how huge this news is, as Freeman has turned the program into what many thought he couldn’t, a perennial national championship contender. Last year was proof the Irish are close, and hopefully this season is motivation for 2026.\n\nAs social media always does, it was quick to react to the news. Here are some of the top reactions to Notre Dame retaining Marcus Freeman for at least another season.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL franchises that had been in communication with him about their jobs that he was staying at Notre Dame, sources tell Sports Illustrated pic.twitter.com/UHJV3WV7rV\n\n— Sports Illustrated (@SInow) December 29, 2025\n\nInteresting that it was multiple teams that went after Freeman, as it was only really known that the New York Giants were interested. Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde had at least one other team who saw him as a good fit for their organization.\n\nA win for college football https://t.co/xF2VfL08AE\n\n— J.D. PicKell (@jdpickell) December 29, 2025\n\nCollege football won today, keeping one of its best away from the professional ranks. Notre Dame clearly is the biggest winner here, but this move sends waves across the top-levels of the game.\n\nMarcus Freeman off the market for NFL teams ... https://t.co/hsJrl3gWDa\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) December 29, 2025\n\nWas there ever really a true market for Freeman, anyone could say that they were interested. You have to wonder how he’ll react if he’s asked about this in a future press conference.\n\nSources confirm coach Marcus Freeman will be back at Notre Dame for the 2026 season and will receive an enhanced contract with the school, as athletic director Pete Bevacqua indicated earlier this month. @ByPatForde first reported.\n\n— Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) December 29, 2025\n\nWorth every penny. Give Freeman a blank check. Don’t let him leave South Bend.\n\nTHE GOAT IS BACK LETS RIDE COACH!!! https://t.co/J7BGjfEJZ8\n\n— ☘️ (@WeAreNDFans) December 29, 2025\n\nThis might be a bit of an overreaction, but getting Freeman back is huge for the 2026 season. He’s the driving force behind the program and will have a loaded team next fall.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL teams that had been in contact with him about their head-coaching openings that he’s staying at Notre Dame, sources told Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde 👀 Natty incoming 2026?\n\n— Talia Baia (@talia_baia) December 29, 2025\n\nGet used to it, as long as Freeman is in South Bend, this is the new normal. Notre Dame should continue to contend for championships and should be one of the few teams that can actually win-it-all next fall.\n\nGreat move by Freeman and ND to shutdown the NFL talk so quickly.\n\nI remember the Brian Kelly to NFL talk after the national championship game run lingered for a long time (Kelly made no secret he was actively interested).\n\nIt really killed our momentum in recruiting & retention.\n\n— G'Irish Talk 🎙️ (@GIrish_Talk) December 29, 2025\n\nWith the transfer portal season coming up, having stability at the head coaching position is huge, and Notre Dame now has that. Players won’t have to worry if Freeman will leave after the window closes, as he’s already announced his return.\n\nI ask myself that every day, but I think his time at Notre Dame is not going to be much longer. Two offseasons in a row he's shown some level of interest in other jobs, mainly in the NFL. Even more so this offseason. If ND is as good as I think they will be in 2026, could be his…\n\n— Bryan Driskell (@CoachD178) December 29, 2025\n\nDriskell is one of the best on the Notre Dame beat, and hopefully his gut is wrong. You can’t deny his read on the situation, it has been back-to-back off-seasons dealing with Freeman potentially heading off to the NFL. Time will tell what ends up happening, but what we know now is that he’ll be coaching Notre Dame next fall.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Social media reacts to Marcus Freeman staying with Notre Dame for 2026",

    "fullText": "With the Buffalo Bills’ one-point loss on Sunday to the Philadelphia Eagles, the New England Patriots were crowned the champions of the AFC East.\n\nThis snapped a franchise record of five consecutive division championships for Buffalo.\n\nWith this streak snapped, the Bills became owners of a new NFL record.\n\nThe Bills became the first team in NFL history to win five or more consecutive division titles and not make a Super Bowl appearance during their run.\n\nThere are only five other franchises in the Super Bowl era to have ever won their division five or more years in a row.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings’ “Purple People Eaters” won the NFC Central six seasons in a row, spanning from 1973 to 1978. Like Buffalo, Minnesota has never won a Super Bowl. However, during this time, the Vikings made appearances in 1974, 1975, and 1977.\n\nThen there was the Pittsburgh Steelers’ “Steel Curtain.” This iteration of the Steelers won their division from 1974 to 1979. They appeared in and won four Super Bowls during those six years.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams held the record for most consecutive divisional titles for 30 years after winning seven in a row starting in 1973. These Rams’ seasons usually ended in a conference championship loss to one of the other teams on this list, but they did manage to make one Super Bowl in the final year of their run.\n\nMost recently, we have the Kansas City Chiefs, whose failure to win the AFC West this season ended their stab at the Patriots’ record. The Chiefs made five Super Bowls during their nine-year reign atop the division, winning three.\n\nBut none compares to New England’s NFL record 11-year division title streak starting in 2009 and ending when Buffalo claimed its first.\n\nThe Patriots appeared in eight straight AFC Conference Championship Games, made five Super Bowl appearances and lifted three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nDrake Maye Boasts ‘It’s Harder To Light Me Up Than You Think’",

    "description": "Will the ax fall on Kevin Stefanski, Mike McDaniel or Shane Steichen? We'll know the day after the 2025 NFL regular season wraps.",
    "fullText": "For 18 teams, the 2026 NFL season begins once Week 18 ends. For a select few, that means leaving losing coaches behind and starting fresh. While there are always a handful of firings across the course of the season — this year that included Tennessee Titans play-caller Brian Callahan and New York Giants former NFL coach of the year Brian Daboll — there's no worse day to be a struggling NFL coach than the day after the season is finished.\n\nBlack Monday is the scourge of underperforming playbook architects. It will claim a handful of careers to ring in the new year January 5, opening the door to coaching interviews and new hires that will energize fan bases across the world — though whether that's a good thing or bad thing will hinge heavily on the candidate. So who could be the recipient of bad headlines the first day after the 2025 NFL regular season ends?\n\nGlenn should be at the top of this list, but New York's reported insistence it will keep him suggests he's safe barring an absolute disaster in Week 18. We cannot rule this out, because absolute disaster has been a hallmark of Glenn's first season as an NFL head coach.\n\nHe started his tenure with seven straight losses. Somehow, the four-game losing streak in which he's currently mired feels worse; his Jets have been outscored by an average margin of just under 27 points per game — and that includes showdowns with sub-.500 teams like the Dolphins and New Orleans Saints. Injuries and trades have depleted both sides of the ball, but you'd be hard pressed to find anything New York does well in 2025.\n\nJustin Fields, Glenn's flier QB addition, has been either injured or terrible this fall. Garrett Wilson's injury turned the receiving corps into a host of replacement-caliber players. None of the team's three starting wideouts in Week 17 began their season on the Jets' active roster. Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams were traded in-season. Qwan'tez Stiggers, Dean Clark and Jarvis Brownlee have all made multiple starts in the secondary — a group that has yet to record an interception this fall.\n\nKeeping Glenn suggests owner Woody Johnson is chalking a brutal 2025 up to an undermanned depth chart and some bad personnel decisions. Still, it's tough to look at the Jets defense and its massive regression from Robert Saleh's peak and think Glenn has the ability to map out a cogent plan as the season wears on and the world changes around him.\n\nHe's set to get another try with multiple first round draft picks and more than $90 million in salary cap room for 2026. Failing there could set the Jets up for another generation of regret.\n\nStefanski is Cleveland's Sisyphus, only if management stepped in to give him a larger, heavier boulder after he'd cleared the halfway point of his mountain. The coach who guided Baker Mayfield to the franchise's first playoff win since 1994 and won 11 games by making Joe Flacco the NFL comeback player of the year (in just six games) has been constantly hamstrung by his franchise's inability to find a viable quarterback.\n\nCleveland traded three first round picks before handing Deshaun Watson a fully guaranteed $230 million despite more than 20 accusations of sexual misconduct and what the NFL itself described as \"predatory behavior\" dating to his time in Houston. For the privilege of blocking the team's most obvious pathways to roster improvement, Watson has played 19 games in four seasons and been the NFL's 48th-best quarterback when on the field.\n\nHis absence has cleared the way for the Browns to improve from 32nd in scoring offense last season to... 31st. The offensive line, once a strength, has devolved into one of the league's worst units. Bright spots remain thanks to Quinshon Judkins and Harold Fannin Jr., but there may not be a coach alive or dead who could coax this team to a respectable record.\n\nAfter that playoff win in his debut, Stefanski has had a losing record in four of the last five seasons. He deserves better. Cleveland firing him could clear him up to actually receive it. Expecting the Browns to do better with his replacement, however, is a tough ask.\n\nMorris got the Atlanta job over Bill Belichick. While he's been better (and less of a circus) than the nine-time Super Bowl winner has at North Carolina, he hasn't inspired confidence. Somehow, remarkably, Morris found a way to beat the Buffalo Bills but lose to the New York Jets — threading a needle that completes the world's tackiest jacket.\n\nQuarterback play has been an issue, with Michael Penix Jr.'s injury giving way to a diminished Kirk Cousins and spurts of inspiring play cropping up like islands in a sea of mediocrity. Atlanta has a galaxy of high level skill players, but thanks to injury and ineffectiveness ranks only 22nd in expected points added (EPA) per play this fall. Pouring draft capital into the pass rush has improved the defense, but that unit has gone from 20th in EPA allowed to... 19th.\n\nOutside help will be difficult to find. Releasing or trading Cousins would shave up to $35 million from the team's 2026 salary cap — useful, considering it's already over the estimated spending limit next fall — but may not be practical with Penix recovering from his third ACL tear. The team's first round pick is owed to the Los Angeles Rams as a result of the trade that made James Pearce a Falcon (he was drafted with the 26th overall selection. Atlanta's pick is shaping up to land in or around the top 10. It's not ideal!).\n\nThat could give Morris one more chance to clean up the mess he's maintained for the past two seasons. If he can fix the defense and lean on guys like Drake London and Bijan Robinson on offense, it could be enough to rise to the top of the NFC South's shallow pool. The help will have to mostly come from within the franchise. With a still-young core, the opportunity for a turnaround will persist. So far, Morris has proven incapable of seizing it.\n\nHow much of the Colts' injury-related crashout will be heaped at the feet of Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard? Indianapolis was once 7-1. Now it's at risk of finishing 2025 with a losing record.\n\nSteichen and Ballard came into the year on the hot seat, emerged as potential award winners over the first half of the season and then shrank from the spotlight as things went sour. Injuries to Daniel Jones and Anthony Richardson didn't help, but that doesn't explain a defense that ranked 10th in expected points added (EPA) per play allowed in the first half of the season slid to 23rd in the second half. Sure, a rise of three-and-outs from an offense eventually commandeered by a 44-year-old Philip Rivers didn't help. Even so, that's a dramatic backslide for a team that held three opponents to 14 points or fewer through Week 8 and has held a single opponent to fewer than 20 points in the nine weeks since.\n\nThe Colts are heading into their first full offseason without former owner Jim Irsay at the helm in four decades. Current principal owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon and her sisters have been raised in a football world and understand the big swings he took to make Indianapolis great for a long stretch (and bad-to-mediocre for a longer one). Would they opt for a clean break to start fresh this January? Or did Jones' revival and subsequent injury create enough plausible deniability to run it back next fall?\n\nInjury luck has been unkind to Gannon, certainly. But it doesn't excuse the fact he's won 30 percent of his games in Arizona over nearly three full seasons. With Kyler Murray shut down for the season (officially due to a foot injury, but unofficially because he was uninspiring and lacked the efficiency and consistency of, big sigh, Jacoby Brissett), the Cardinals have lost eight straight games. Despite a 3-13 record, they may not wind up with a top-three draft pick from it thanks to the league's hardest strength of schedule.\n\nEven without a top-two pick in a two-quarterback draft (we'll see how the spring workouts shake out for Ty Simpson et al), we may have seen the end of the Murray era in Arizona. The former first overall pick has played more than 11 games only once in his last four seasons. His 0.084 EPA per dropback ranks 23rd among 53 quarterbacks to play at least 500 snaps in that stretch, which isn't terrible but also hasn't resulted in success. The Cardinals haven't had a winning season since 2021.\n\nTrading away Murray would create more than $35 million in salary cap savings and a clean slate for a team unable to get out of its own way. Would Arizona trust a new franchise quarterback to the head coach who engineered a top-three offense in Philadelphia to get the job, then built the league's 17th-best offense in the three years that followed? While Gannon coaxed another forgettably solid year out of Brissett, his lack of wins suggests the ceiling for another veteran QB wouldn't be much higher in 2026.\n\nMcDaniel has been able to make more from less, turning around a team that looked absolutely cooked to start the season (1-6) en route to a .500-ish record. That's happened without Tyreek Hill in the lineup and followed the benching of Tua Tagovailoa. Rookie seventh round pick Quinn Ewers may not be the team's future, but McDaniel installed an offense around him that allowed him to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 17 to further dim the Bucs' Super Bowl hopes.\n\nThat's all encouraging. It does not change the fact McDaniel failed to make Tagovailoa more than a fantasy football star, an 0-2 playoff record or a 9-14 record in December or later. The unconventional head coach has done a great job adding a slick layer of sheen atop his franchise that begins to flake apart under modest scrutiny. He's had one season with a top 20 scoring defense. He hasn't cracked the top 20 in scoring offense either of the last two years.\n\nLike Gannon above, McDaniel's franchise is on the verge of swapping out a once-touted, highly paid and since-benched quarterback in service of a fresh start. But Tagovailoa's contract, injury history and the smoldering crater his 2025 play created makes him considerably more difficult to trade and there's nearly $100 million worth of dead salary attached to the $212 million extension he signed in (deep exhale) 2024. Miami isn't bad enough to land a top prospect on an inexpensive salary in the draft. Its best option may be hoping for a Sam Darnold or Baker Mayfield-type revival from a journeyman veteran.\n\nThat could benefit McDaniel, who supercharged Tagovailoa just long enough to be an albatross around the team's neck and just won a game with a seventh round rookie behind center. McDaniel's place in Kyle Shanahan's coaching tree suggests a special appreciation for getting the most out of flawed passers. But four seasons of underwhelming returns and no playoff success to speak of may shuffle him back to the coordinator ranks for a few years instead.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: 6 NFL coaches on the hot seat for Black Monday",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Matthew Stafford reached a career milestone, though his three interceptions hurt the Rams' chances of winning a game and perhaps his own of winning the NFL's MVP.\n\nStafford set a career high in touchdown passes in a season with 42 when he hit Puka Nakua for an 11-yard score with 2:46 to play, but the Falcons answered with a 51-yard field goal with 21 seconds left and upset the Rams 27-24 on Monday night.\n\nStafford was 22 for 38 for 269 yards with two touchdowns and a season-high three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown. It was the quarterback's first three-interception game since Week 1 of the 2022 season.\n\n“He’s a total stud,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “We wouldn’t be in a lot of the great situations we’re in without him. But tonight was, it was a night that he’s capable of playing better.”\n\nStafford helped rally the Rams from a 24-3 second-half deficit to tie the score at 24 on his scoring toss to Nakua. His first touchdown was a 27-yard pass to Terrence Ferguson in the third quarter that pulled the Rams within 24-10.\n\nStafford was also sacked three times, which matched a season high, but didn't feel like the Falcons' pressure was overwhelming.\n\n“Every week is a new challenge,\" Stafford said. \"Just because you play good one week doesn’t mean you’re going to play good the next, and vice versa. So just got to go out there and continue to trust what we’ve done all year, and then we got to just show up and make the plays on game day.”\n\nStafford’s previous high for touchdowns in a season was 41, which he accomplished twice. He had 41 in 2011 with the Lions and in 2021 with the Rams.\n\nStafford was the betting favorite to win the first MVP award of his 17-year career ahead of Patriots second-year quarterback Drake Maye. On Sunday, Maye had a near-perfect afternoon against the Jets, presumably closing the gap on Stafford. Maye was 19 for 21 for 256 yards and five touchdowns in New York as the Patriots rolled to a 42-10 win. He played the first six possessions of the game and led the Patriots to six touchdowns.\n\nStafford is averaging 278 passing yards per game to Maye's 262.7, has 42 passing TDs to Maye's 30 and the quarterbacks are even with eight interceptions apiece. Maye's big day against the Jets pulled him virtually even with Stafford in passer rating prior to the Falcons game. Maye also has 409 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns while Stafford has -2 rushing yards and no rushing touchdowns on the season. Maye's completion percentage, which leads the NFL, is 71.7 to Stafford's 65.2 (18th).\n\nThe Patriots clinched the AFC East on Sunday and enter Week 18 with a 13-3 record, while Stafford's Rams are 11-5 and will enter the playoffs as a wild card. The Patriots will close the regular season at home against the Dolphins and still have a shot at the No. 1 seed in the AFC, so Maye figures to play. Los Angeles will host the Arizona Cardinals and McVay said Monday his starters will play.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Finding the best fits for mid-round quarterbacks in the 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe story of the 2026 NFL Draft's quarterback class will be defined by its thinning at the top. Fernando Mendoza is the odds-on favorite to go 1.01. If he declares, Oregon's Dante Moore shouldn't last much longer. But this isn't the class the football world was sold, and teams' actions early in the offseason will reflect that.\n\nInstead, we are left with an unsteady crop of quarterbacks, many of whom decided to return to school. The seniors that aren't afforded that option are headed to the league with less hype than the summer suggested and little expectations of rookie-year playing time.\n\nIn an NFL era that has rendered the Day 2 quarterback an endangered species, several passers may fall into Day 3. While that has consequences for their rookie contracts, it could also open the door for more competitive teams offering a promising path to development.\n\nGarrett Nussmeier, LSU: Arizona Cardinals\n\nA Day 2 option that I've penciled into prior mock drafts is Nussmeier heading to the desert. It may not come as early as initially anticipated, but there's reason to believe that both parties could benefit from a fresh start.\n\nKyler Murray has proven he isn't the answer in Arizona. He may return for one last stand, but at some point, the Cardinals will need a new option under center. Unlike the out-of-structure prowess that Murray enjoys, Nussmeier projects more like a game manager. Similar to Jacoby Brissett, Nussmeier can win pre-snap and run the offense as it's intended, opening up the middle of the field and feeding receivers with more consistent targets.\n\nThe Cardinals prefer Brissett's style to Murray. Opting for Nussmeier provides a similar skill set with more credibility as a long-term option.\n\nNussmeier dealt with an injury to his midsection and wasn't quite as polished in 2025. As the floor drops on his stock, Arizona can take a shot on a new passer without wasting resources on a potential first-round prospect in 2027.\n\nJohn Mateer, Oklahoma: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nThe Buccaneers have been beneficiaries of Baker Mayfield's career resurgence. Unfortunately for Tampa, his step back has left them closer to quarterback purgatory than they would like to admit.\n\nI'm lower than most on Mayfield, but this isn't an indictment on his status as next year's quarterback. He'll likely return and do so with the optimism of a healthier squad (and probably a new head coach). We know that this offense can work around Mayfield's measurable shortcomings, and living with his volatility has been a welcome part of the experience. Thus, a pivot to Mateer in April makes sense.\n\nMORE: Cole Payton gives Senior Bowl a small-school boost at quarterback\n\nMateer wouldn't start right away, but his similarities to Mayfield make him a viable backup in this offense and provide the Buccaneers with an off-ramp if contract talks get messy.\n\nMateer needs development before he starts on Sundays. He's more comfortable out of structure than inside it, draws pressure on himself in the pocket, and can be too reliant on his legs. Still, that mobility should amplify a below-average backfield in ways that Mayfield's scrambling has not.\n\nAt Oklahoma, Mateer's play style and moxie made him the Sooners' spiritual successor to Mayfield. He could have a similar opportunity in a perpetually-winnable NFC South.\n\nCarson Beck, Miami: Indianapolis Colts\n\nIndianapolis has created a special kind of catastrophe. Daniel Jones seems likely to return, albeit off an Achilles and not necessarily ready for Week 1. With limited mobility, he's a tough passer to trust. An orbital fracture further curtailed Anthony Richardson's development. I don't know what the Year 4 version of him looks like, and after his historically poor performances in 2024, I'm not sure I (nor Shane Steichen) want to find out.\n\nThe Colts don't have the ammo to take an early-round passer, either. This is a room that, as currently constructed, has one of the lowest floors in football.\n\nIndianapolis needs a polished passer who can keep Steichen's offense on the tracks and do enough for the ground game to churn out victories. Early on Day 3, Miami's Carson Beck might be the best bet to do so.\n\nDespite flashing early in the year (and entering the 2025 cycle as the preseason QB1), Beck profiles as a backup who has more present-day competence than long-term upside. He's played a lot of college ball against premium competition and has enough tools to trust with playing time. Throw in the allure of Steichen's wizardry and squint hard enough, and Beck is a low-risk dice roll of getting the Colts out of this mess.\n\nDrew Allar, Penn State: Detroit Lions\n\nIt was a nightmare season for everyone in Happy Valley, none more than Drew Allar.\n\nOnce a first-round hopeful, Allar began the cycle as a Day 2 option with enough upside to get Round 1 looks. He struggled in 2025, and an ankle injury ended his college career.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty in this profile. His broken ankle could dampen his athleticism, limit a skill-set that wasn't particularly twitchy, or keep him from getting crucial reps for his intangible development. He could also be fine! But no longer is Allar a polarizing passer for teams to take at a discount.\n\nAllar never proved he could cash in on his elite physical traits, even with Penn State's army of top recruits. Now, he enters the league without a real platform year and injury concerns headlining his profile.\n\nAllar needs to land on a team with a strong offensive infrastructure and no demand to play in Year 1. Few teams check those boxes like the Detroit Lions. Jared Goff isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and it doesn't make sense to move him until after the 2026 season, regardless of his performance.\n\nYet, the Lions' window is closing fast, and as Super Bowl aspirations shrink, patience for Goff will follow. There's a world in which the 2027 Lions are led by another quarterback, leaving at least one season for Allar to get healthy and develop in the incubator of Detroit's offense. Armed with an elite ground game, quality receivers, and a good young coach, Allar makes about as much sense on paper as a Day 3 project can get.\n\nCole Payton, North Dakota State: Carolina Panthers\n\nThere's a fog of war that comes with evaluating NDSU talents. The talent gap between the Bison and their competition is as fierce as any in college football, and their NFL quarterbacks have reflected that uncertainty. Carson Wentz was an MVP favorite who quickly became a castaway. Easton Stick never stuck, and Trey Lance will start in Week 18 on his third team in as many years.\n\nPayton doesn't have to follow any of those paths, but the pre-draft circuit will be crucial in selling himself to NFL evaluators.\n\nThe Panthers can't get away with drafting a quarterback in Round 1, especially if they win in Week 18 and get to host a playoff game. That doesn't change their circumstances under center, where Young has taken a bumpy road to below average.\n\nEventually, Carolina will look to move off of Young and the limitations of being the league's shortest passer. Payton offers an imposing frame as a rusher and surplus arm talent, earning him some looks as a potential starter. Sitting behind Young gives him a chance to learn under quarterback guru Dave Canales, and if he gets a chance to play, that same volatility could serve the Panthers well.\n\nIf Payton starts and plays well, Carolina can strike gold and justify moving on from Young. If the jump from NDSU to the NFL is too large for Payton to clear, he might be bad enough to get the Panthers a top pick. In either scenario, he's unlikely to set the career mark for lowest yards per completion, unlike Carolina's current quarterback.\n\nEmmett Johnson scouting report: Nebraska's back makes case for RB2\n\nTop prospects the Kansas City Chiefs can pick after Patrick Mahomes' injury\n\nArch Manning's NFL Draft decision means doubling down on Texas\n\nLaNorris Sellers' 2026 NFL Draft decision leaves more questions than answers",

Far later in the week, Game 272, as NBC will continue to drill into our heads, features the AFC North title fight between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.\n\nAnnouncers: Chris Fowler, Dan Orlovsky, Louis Riddick, Katie George, Peter Schrager\n\nAnnouncers: Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, Lisa Salters, Laura Rutledge\n\nAnnouncers: Spero Dedes, Adam Archuleta, Aditi Kinkhabwala\n\nAnnouncers: Ian Eagle, JJ Watt, Evan Washburn\n\nAnnouncers: Tom McCarthy, Logan Ryan, Amanda Balionis\n\nAnnouncers: Kevin Kugler, Daryl Johnston, Allison Williams\n\nAnnouncers: Chris Myers, Mark Schlereth, Jen Hale\n\nAnnouncers: Adam Amin, Drew Brees, Kristina Pink\n\nAnnouncers: Jim Nantz, Tony Romo, Tracy Wolfson\n\nAnnouncers: Chris Lewis, Kyle Long, Tiffany Blackmon\n\nAnnouncers: Kevin Harlan, Ross Tucker, Melanie Collins\n\nAnnouncers: Andrew Catalon, Charles Davis, Jason McCourty, AJ Ross\n\nAnnouncers: Joe Davis, Greg Olsen, Pam Oliver\n\nAnnouncers: Kenny Albert, Jonathan Vilma, Megan Olivi\n\nAnnouncers: Kevin Burkhardt, Tom Brady, Erin Andrews, Tom Rinaldi\n\nAnnouncers: Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth, Melissa Stark\n\nThis article originally appeared on The List Wire: NFL announcer assignments for Week 18",

    "description": "Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka told reporters on Monday afternoon that he has “no doubt” rookie Jaxson Dart is a legitimate NFL franchise quarterback.",
    "fullText": "The Giants were able to snap their nine-game losing streak in Las Vegas on Sunday, but they still find themselves sitting at 3-13 with just one game left to play.\n\nWhile there hasn’t been much to cheer about this year for the Big Blue faithful, there are some things they can take away from the campaign with an eye towards the future.\n\nEasily the biggest is the play of rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart.\n\nDart began the season as Russell Wilson’s backup, but he quickly jumped up the depth chart as the offense struggled in the early-going, and has put forward plenty of positives.\n\nThough there have been some bumps along the way as expected with a young QB, the Ole Miss product has shown that he has what it takes to be very successful in this league.\n\nInterim head coach Mike Kafka certainly agrees, telling reporters on Monday afternoon that he has “no doubt” Dart is a legitimate NFL franchise quarterback.\n\nKafka said the 22-year-old playmaker has been a pleasure to work with throughout his rookie campaign, and he’s seen tremendous growth from him as a leader both on and off the field.\n\n“He’s learning every day, absorbing as much as he can, and putting his own fingerprint on things,” Kafka said. “That’s what’s most important is you see the growth and you see a player that’s continuing to learn from the good, the bad, and continuing to take steps forward and continuing to step up and rise to the occasion when things aren’t great.\n\n“Those are the leadership qualities you’re seeing from Jaxson, and as a player, he’s going to continue to grow and get better -- I’m proud to be working with him and happy for him, and I’m excited to continue to do that this week.”\n\nDart has accounted for 22 touchdowns (13 passing, nine rushing) while throwing just five interceptions over his first 11 starts, seven of which have been against playoff teams.\n\nHe’s completed 63.2 percent of his passes for 2,042 yards and has also rushed for 455 yards.",

    "title": "NFL coaching hot seat: Who's feeling most heat, which established guys are under pressure",
    "description": "Week 18 is upon us, which means Black Sunday and Monday are, too. Here are the names to know on the coaching hot seat as the NFL regular season draws to a close.",
    "fullText": "We’ve made it to Week 18 in the NFL season, which means we’re only days away from Black Sunday and Monday, the colloquial term for all the head coach firings that inevitably take place once the season ends.\n\nTwo head coaches, the Tennessee Titans’ Brian Callahan and the New York Giants’ Brian Daboll, have already lost their jobs. How many more will join them?\n\nWe’re taking the temperature of the coaches on or approaching the hot seat all week./\n\nRecord with team: 2-14, first season\n\nWhy he might get fired: Carroll was supposed to bring stability to the franchise, but it’s been more losing under the 74-year-old former Super Bowl winner. The Raiders haven’t won since Week 6, the offseason trade for Carroll’s preferred QB Geno Smith hasn’t yielded much, the offensive and special teams coordinators were both fired in November, and now there’s a dispute with Maxx Crosby over the star pass rusher being placed on injured reserve. None of this reflects well on Carroll, who may be in over his head trying to fix a franchise where the rot goes much deeper (and higher).\n\nWhy he might be safe: There was a reason Carroll was hired. He is almost 40 games over .500 for his NFL career, and that’s counting this season’s debacle. Also, Mark Davis has paid out a lot of money for failed coaches over the past few years and maybe he doesn’t want to shell out for Carroll too. Still, it’s hard to find a great reason to stick with Carroll, given hiss age and the Raiders’ need of an organization-wide reset.\n\nRecord with team: 45-58 (including playoffs), sixth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Browns are headed for a fourth losing record in six years under Stefanski, as well as a second straight year picking in the top-five of the draft. The cataclysmic Deshaun Watson trade is partly on Stefanski, who recruited him in the spring of 2022, and for all of Stefanski’s offensive acumen, none of the 13 (!) quarterbacks who’ve started under his watch has proven to be the long-term solution.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Stefanski has done quite a bit with limited talent, especially on offense, and team owner Jimmy Haslam might give him a chance to actually develop a highly drafted QB. Stefanski has also been to the playoffs twice and maintains a steady demeanor, win or lose. He has won NFL Coach of the Year twice, and it’s not like this would be an attractive opening for this cycle’s top candidates.\n\nRecord with team: 14-18, second season (this stint)\n\nWhy he might get fired: Morris hasn’t been flat-out bad, but the Falcons have regressed this season and the overall operation feels shaky under his watch. While he might end up a fall guy alongside general manager Terry Fontenot, who oversaw an all-in 2025 that included trading away the team’s first-round pick next spring, Morris also hasn’t made a strong case for himself.\n\nWhy he might be safe: As mentioned above, the Falcons’ current mess is more on Fontenot. That doesn’t mean Morris is blameless — the McVay tree magic that Atlanta doubtlessly sought by bringing him in along with offensive coordinator Zac Robinson hasn’t materialized — but it also means team owner Arthur Blank might give him another year.\n\nRecord with team: 15-35, third season\n\nWhy he might get fired: Gannon was hired in part to toughen up Arizona’s defense, and that hasn’t really happened. This year’s unit is 26th in EPA per play allowed, 27th in success rate allowed, and in general hasn’t taken a step forward despite 17 of Gannon’s 28 draft picks being on that side of the ball, including six of seven last spring. It’s hard to say the Cardinals are demonstrably better than they were when Gannon was hired.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Kyler Murray is the biggest question lingering over the franchise, and Gannon might be winning more with better QB play. Perhaps team owner Michael Bidwill gives him a chance to prove it. He did have the Cardinals on an upward trajectory through his first two seasons.\n\nRecord with team: 34-32 (including playoffs), fourth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The story of the McDaniel era (thus far) is starting with a bang and petering out, both in the micro and macro. He made the playoffs his first two seasons (including a hallowed 70 burger against the Broncos), but lost six of the last seven in 2022 and four of his last six in 2023. Since then, his motion-heavy, speed-oriented offense has been less effective against the league as a whole, and off-field issues (including players reportedly running out defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who won a Super Bowl with the Eagles last season) suggest McDaniel doesn’t have much command of the locker room.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Tua Tagovailoa’s limitations and concussion concerns have limited the Dolphins, and if they don’t bring him back next season, the salary cap hit would be so big that team owner Stephen Ross might decide it’s worth keeping McDaniel around one more year to get out from under it.\n\nRecord with team: 3-13, first season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Jets have been largely non-competitive, and that’s not what anyone expected in Glenn’s first season. He earned respect as a Pro Bowl player and the Lions’ defensive coordinator the past few seasons, but the Jets’ defense has regressed, the quarterback play has been bad, and the Jets were big-time sellers at the trade deadline. Justin Fields was benched in November and defensive coordinator Steve Wilks was fired in December. There aren’t many more heads to roll here.\n\nWhy he might be safe: At the league meetings in October, team owner Woody Johnson was candid that the Jets’ problems were at QB, not with Glenn. That carries a lot of weight, and Johnson’s stance reportedly hasn’t changed. The Jets also have five first-round draft picks the next two drafts, and there’s ample opportunity for Glenn to reshape the franchise in his image.\n\nRecord with team: 193-123 (including playoffs), 18th season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Ravens have been surprisingly mediocre this season, and it can’t all be attributed to Lamar Jackson’s injuries. Their defense has yo-yo’d between outright bad and competent, and some of Harbaugh’s in-game decisions have drawn scrutiny. Harbaugh has failed to get back to the Super Bowl with a two-time MVP quarterback in Jackson, and there’s a general sense that a breath of fresh air at head coach might be good for the Ravens.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Harbaugh has had only two losing seasons, and the stability he brings the organization is valuable. If he’s not back, it won’t be because he became a bad coach overnight.\n\nRecord with team: 200-125-2 (including playoffs), 19th season\n\nWhy he might get fired: A few weeks ago, fans were chanting “Fire Tomlin” during a blowout loss to the Bills. Then the Steelers took control over the AFC North and all was forgotten. But a loss to the 4-12 Browns, when Pittsburgh had a shot to clinch the division, forced a winner-take-all game against the Ravens in Week 18. Would a loss in that game, and no playoff berth, restart the talk about the Steelers and Tomlin both needing fresh starts?\n\nWhy he might be safe: Tomlin is a very good coach and to the chagrin of many Steelers fans, has had unending support from ownership. The Steelers value continuity, so they wouldn’t make a rash decision on Tomlin’s future. And it seems even more unlikely they’d make a move if the Steelers win the AFC North in the season finale.\n\nRecord with team: 35-35, fourth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Buccaneers went on a long losing streak, dropping seven of eight and losing control of a weak NFC South. The Bucs’ downturn came as they got healthier, which was confusing. There were some bad losses, and for a coach without a great career record, maybe there isn’t a reason to believe things will be decidedly better in 2026.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Bowles did lead the Buccaneers to three division titles in his first three seasons, albeit in a mediocre NFC South. And the Buccaneers are still alive to win the division this season, even though they’re 7-9. Teams usually don’t fire coaches after making the playoffs, even if it comes with a losing record.\n\nRecord with team: 57-64-1, seventh season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Bengals have missed the playoffs three straight seasons in Joe Burrow’s prime. Some of that can be attributed to Burrow’s injuries, but the Bengals’ deficiencies in protecting Burrow have contributed to his injuries. And the team around Burrow, particularly the defense, hasn’t been very good in a few years. Burrow expressed earlier this season that he wasn’t having fun, and while he has not pinned that on Taylor, the Bengals need to figure out what changes need to be made to keep Burrow happy.\n\nWhy he might be safe: One run to the Super Bowl is doing a lot of the heavy lifting on Taylor’s résumé. That came back during the 2021 season. But that has carried the reputation of the Bengals being annual contenders in the AFC, if Burrow could just stay healthy. Also, this is the Bengals, and they’re not going to want to pay someone who isn’t coaching for them anymore.\n\nWhy he might not get the job: It’s hard to point to the Giants’ record after Kafka replaced Brian Daboll and get excited. He has fired defensive coordinator Shane Bowen and assistant defensive line coach Bryan Cox since taking over, which is the type of chaos that doesn’t look great on an interim coach either.\n\nWhy he might get the job: Kafka has been mentioned as a future head coaching candidate in previous years, for his work as an offensive coordinator. And while the team’s record hasn’t been good, there have been close losses to good teams in that stretch.\n\nWhy he might not get the job: It was a forced arrangement after the team realized Brian Callahan needed to be fired. McCoy at least had some head-coaching experience. Hiring an interim who has put together a 2-8 record wouldn’t go over well with the fanbase.\n\nWhy he might get the job: Give McCoy this much: The Titans have played better late in the season, even if it hasn’t resulted in many wins. But it would be stunning if the Titans settled on McCoy after another miserable season.",

    "description": "Will the Birds play to win in the regular season finale? Here’s a potential clue.",
    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles have opened as 7.5-point home favorites against the Washington Commanders in Week 18, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nWe’ve yet to learn of the Eagles’ official intentions when it comes to playing starters or not but this line seems to suggest they’re not just going to fold with the No. 2 seed potentially available to them. Or maybe it’s about the Birds’ backups being able to beat Washington anyway.\n\nElsewhere of interest to the Eagles, the Chicago Bears are just 1.5-point home favorites against the Detroit Lions in Week 18. Surprised the Bears aren’t favored by more since they have motivation to win to secure the No. 2 seed and the Lions have already been eliminated from playoff contention. Seems like the odds-makers are expecting Dan Campbell’s team to put up a fight regardless.\n\nIf you parlay the Eagles’ moneyline and the Lions’ moneyline together, the odds for that scenario are +160. It’s not likely, no, but it’s hardly far-fetched.\n\nThe thinking here is the Eagles will be playing to win in Week 18. The Commanders might not merely lay down after not liking how Philly beat them in Week 16. But their effort might not matter much with Josh Johnson potentially starting at quarterback for them.\n\nI think the Eagles win and cover, perhaps even if Tanner McKee and the backups play most of the game.

    "fullText": "The final Sunday in 2025 provided football fans with a memorable game that featured plenty of offensive firepower.\n\nWith how the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers moved the ball and scored, it felt like a game that would end with whatever team had the ball last.\n\nCaleb Williams and the Bears had their shot with 2:15 left in the game, down by four points.\n\nThe Bears quarterback led his team on a 15-play drive that ended on the 49ers’ 2-yard line after Williams attempted to extend the play to find an open receiver. With the 49ers’ defense closing in, Williams threw a pass into the end zone, but it fell short.\n\nWild ending to an incredible game. pic.twitter.com/Xe6pJkBfEa\n\nThe Bears lost 42-38, which eliminates them from contention for the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Still, as NFC North champions, they will host at least one playoff game at Soldier Field.\n\nHere are the five players who raised and lowered their stock in the Week 17 shootout at Levi’s Stadium.\n\nWilliams had one of his best passing performances of the season, completing 25 of 42 throws for 330 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nHis first TD pass of the day — to rookie Luther Burden III — was a perfectly thrown 35-yard strike in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWilliams’ second TD pass — to Colston Loveland in the second quarter– displayed some of his elite quarterback traits. Williams drew the 49ers’ defense offside with his cadence, kept his eyes downfield after the snap, then threw a dart to his rookie tight end for a 36-yard score.\n\nCaleb Williams gets the 49ers on the hard count.\n\nTouchdown, Colston Loveland\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWith how well the 49ers’ offense played, Williams needed to match Brock Purdy on the other side. For a majority of the game, that’s exactly what he did. However, he missed some throws.\n\nOn the final drive, Williams was heavily pressured on a first-and-10 play. He ran away from the pressure to his right but couldn’t complete a pass to wide-open Devin Duvernay on what might have been a game-winning TD.\n\nthis was 7 pic.twitter.com/WzuR5ONtEM\n\n— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) December 29, 2025\n\nIt only took one play for the former All-Pro cornerback to change the game.\n\nJohnson jumped Jauan Jennings’ slant route and deflected Purdy’s first pass on the first play of the game into the air. T.J. Edwards intercepted the ball and returned it 34 yards for a pick six.\n\nT.J. EDWARDS, PICK-SIX ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nJohnson finished the game with zero receptions allowed on one target. He wasn’t targeted for the remainder of the game after helping cause the pick six, but he also played limited snaps in the second half.\n\nJohnson has given up just seven receptions on 12 targets for 142 yards in six games this season, and he has one interception. It shows just how important keeping Johnson healthy is to the Bears’ defense.\n\nThe Bears’ rookie wide receiver returned to action after missing last week’s win over the Green Bay Packers and quickly made an impact.\n\nEntering their third drive, the Bears had failed to record a first down. Then Williams found Burden for a 10-yard gain on second down. Three plays later, Williams connected with Burden on an explosive 35-yard TD pass, giving Chicago’s offense its first points of the game late in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nBurden finished as the game’s leading receiver with eight receptions on nine targets for 138 yards and the TD. He was injured on the final play of the game, and head coach Ben Johnson didn’t have an immediate update on the rookie’s condition.\n\nThe Bears’ veteran linebacker had the daunting task of trying to contain Christian McCaffrey. The entire defense, especially Edmunds, failed to keep the 49ers’ versatile playmaker in check.\n\nMcCaffrey finished the first half with 18 carries for 121 yards and one TD. He added two receptions for 20 yards as a pass catcher before halftime.\n\n: NBC\nNFL+// https://t.co/Zkva0Y3QRRpic.twitter.com/Lw0glXcnaP\n\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) December 29, 2025\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Edmunds allowed seven receptions on seven targets for 55 yards and two TDs.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense, which features plenty of motions and shifts, forced Edmunds and the rest of the Bears’ defensive front to react slowly, and San Francisco benefited throughout the game, finishing with 496 total yards (200 rushing, 296 passing).\n\nThe Bears cornerback dealt with a hamstring injury and an illness throughout the week, but he was able to start against the 49ers.\n\nHe’s had a remarkable season, but this wasn’t a good showing. Per Pro Football Focus, Wright gave up four receptions on five targets for 73 yards in just the first half.\n\nWright looked a step slow and couldn’t stay in front of opposing receivers.\n\nThe post Five Bears whose stock went up or down in NFL Week 17 loss to 49ers appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",

I see him each and every day, he works real hard. Even after practice. I feel like it just carries on throughout this whole team.”\n\nMaye had a fantastic performance in the Patriots’ 42-10 victory against the New York Jets on Sunday, throwing for 256 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nHenderson and Maye need to put together a few more standout performances in the coming weeks to help ensure the Patriots win every postseason game they play in.\n\nPatriots’ Stefon Diggs Shares Why He Loves Playing For Mike Vrabel",

Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns have been historically inept, posting just three winning seasons during the same span.\n\nThe Steelers should dominate the Browns. And yet, that hasn’t been the case at all recently.\n\nCleveland beat Pittsburgh again on Sunday, spoiling the Steelers’ chance to clinch the AFC North with a 13-6 upset. Pittsburgh looked completely helpless on offense for much of the game, failing to score a touchdown and getting shut out during the second half.\n\nIt wasn’t a fluke, either, as the Browns are now 6-1-1 against the Steelers in their last eight meetings in Cleveland. Pittsburgh has lost its last four trips there.\n\nSplit season series 6 out of 7 yr\n\nNo PIT win in CLE without Ben Roethilsberger since Week 12, 2003.\n\n— Andrew Siciliano (@AndrewSiciliano) December 28, 2025\n\nEven worse, the Steelers haven’t won in Cleveland without Ben Roethlisberger since the 2003 season.\n\nDivisional games are often close and tend to produce upsets, but there’s no excuse. Pittsburgh needs to do a better job taking care of business against the Browns, especially this late in the season when Cleveland has a rookie QB under center and nothing to play for.\n\nThe Steelers’ loss this week could come back to haunt them if they lose to the Baltimore Ravens in their season finale, which would cost them the division and a playoff spot. Pittsburgh could have clinched a postseason berth with a win in Cleveland, which should have been relatively easy. Instead, the Steelers laid an egg and now face a win-or-go-home scenario.\n\nIf they lose, they’ll have no one to blame but themselves.\n\nMore Steelers: Myles Garrett Trolls Steelers After Humiliating Loss To Browns\n\nThe post Steelers’ Bizarre Struggles Against Browns Continue With Embarrassing Loss appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "When the Chicago Bears traveled to Motown for their Week 2 matchup against the Detroit Lions, the Lions won big, 52-21. The Lions and their fans were fired up for that game, and it had a playoff-like atmosphere, because they wanted to make a statement and stick it to Ben Johnson for leaving to become the Bears’ head coach.\n\nHindsight tells us that the Week 2 win for Lions’ fans was like their Super Bowl, because earlier this week, their team was eliminated from the playoffs. So they can raise the “Beat Ben Johnson in his first game back” banner and enjoy the offseason!\n\nBut seriously, the (8-8) Lions are still a dangerous team with a high-powered offense, and the (11-5) Bears will need to bounce back after the loss in San Francisco to lock up the two seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Week 18 Lions vs Bears rematch is in Chicago, and our partners at FanDuel Sportsbook have the Bears as a 1.5-point favorite, with the game’s point total over/under at 49.5.\n\nBoth Chicago and the (11-5) Philadelphia Eagles are vying for that second seed, and they’ll both play in the late afternoon window. Philadelphia is a 7.5-point favorite over the visiting Washington Commanders, and if the Bears and Eagles finish with the same record, Chicago holds the tiebreaker.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the early odds for these games?\n\nDo you think the Bears will win and lock up the two seed?",

    "fullText": "Game update (Sunday evening): With Buffalo’s loss to the Eagles, the Patriots have clinched the AFC East.\n\nGame update: New England’s blowout win over the New York Jets moves the Patriots one step closer to clinching the AFC East. If the Bills lose or tie against the Eagles later today, the Patriots will clinch the AFC East title.\n\nIf Buffalo wins that game, New England can clinch the AFC East with a win over the Dolphins next week.\n\nNew England’s win also prevents the Broncos from clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The Patriots can still catch Denver in that race. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nThe New England Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the AFC East in Week 15, when they blew a 21-0 lead and lost to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nBut the upstart Patriots can finish the job in Week 17, albeit with a little bit of help.\n\nHere is how the Patriots can clinch the AFC East for the first time since the 2019 season, Tom Brady’s last campaign in New England.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nHere are the full AFC standings entering Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC East standings entering Week 17:\n\nHere are the current AFC East standings:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x",

    "fullText": "It turns out the New Orleans Saints can win and have their cake and eat it, too. Sunday's win over the Tennessee Titans improved the Saints' record to 6-10 on the year, but it didn't drop the Saints any further down in the 2026 NFL draft order. They're still projected to pick at eighth overall by the experts at Tankathon.\n\nNow, we shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves. There are still a couple of prime-time games left to play and Monday night's matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams could shake things up if the Falcons lose and join the Saints at 6-10. Still, we have a good idea at where many teams will be picking, even if the draft order won't really begin to lock into place until after next week's games.\n\nStill, we're talking about going from eighth to potentially ninth. That would happen if the Falcons lose and their strength of schedule is calculated to be lower than New Orleans'. Right now, the Saints own that tiebreaker at .492 against Atlanta's .498. Margins don't get much slimmer than that.\n\nBut don't expect any help from the Rams. They're still competing for playoff seeding and they happen to own Atlanta's first round draft pick, so they're doubly motivated to beat up on the dirty birds. Of course there's a scenario where the Falcons lose and the Saints remain at No. 8. We just won't know until the dust settles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Saints' big Week 17 win didn't hurt their chances",

    "fullText": "NFL standings: Updated AFC, NFC playoff pictures for Week 17 of 2025 season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhat 14 teams are positioned to make the NFL playoffs in the 2025 regular season, from the eight division winners to six total wild cards?\n\nWhat would the seeding look like in the race for Super Bowl LX?\n\nHere are the answers in Sporting News' latest look at how the postseason field is coming together in both conferences going into the late Sunday and Monday games of Week 17:\n\nNFL Week 17 picks against the spread\n\n1. Denver Broncos, 13-3 (champions, AFC West)\n\nThe Broncos clinched the division title after holding off the Chiefs on Christmas night and then watching the second-place Chargers lose to the Texans on Saturday. They will need to beat the Chargers or see the Patriots lose to the Dolphins to earn the top seed in Week 18.\n\n2. New England Patriots, 13-3 (champions, AFC East)\n\nThe Patriots clinched the division title with their win over the Jets coupled by the Bills losing the Eagles. They can still earn the top seed over the Broncos with a win over the Dolphins and a Broncos loss to the Chargers in Week 18.\n\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars, 12-4 (first place, AFC South)\n\nThe Jaguars, who have clinched at least an AFC wild-card berth, still lead the division by a game over the Texans after their win over the Colts. The Jaguars will win the division with a win over the Titans or a Texans loss to the Colts in Week 18.\n\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers, 9-7 (first place, AFC North)\n\nThe Steelers, who got shocked by the Browns on Sunday, ssaw their division lead over the Ravens shrink after one game after the Ravens beat the Packers on Saturday night. The Steelers will now host a de facto division championship game vs. the Ravens in Week 18.\n\n5. Houston Texans, 11-5 (second place, AFC South)\n\nThe Texans, who have clinched at least a wild-card berth, kept the pressure on the Jaguars in the division after beating the Chargers on the road on Saturday. The Texans have the top wild-card spot thanks to a head-to-head sweep of the Bills and Chargers. The Texans need the Jaguars to lose to the Titans in Week 18 and also beat the Colts to win a third consecutive division title.\n\n6. Los Angeles Chargers, 11-5 (second place, AFC West)\n\nThe Chargers have clinched a playoff berth and will settle for being a strong wild-card team again. They lose the head-to-head tiebreaker vs. the Texans from Week 17 but hold the common-games tiebreaker over the Bills going into Week 18.\n\n7. Buffalo Bills, 11-5 (second place, AFC East)\n\nThe Bills have clinched a playoff berth but saw their five-year division reign end with their home loss to the Eagles in Week 17 coupled with the Patriots' rout of the Jets. The Bills are playing for only wild-card position now and could rest players vs. the Jets.\n\nNFL WEEK 17 PICKS: Against the spread | Straight-up predictions\n\nThe Ravens kept their division title hopes alive by winning a tough interconference matchup at the Packers on Saturday night and then watching the Steelers lose on Sunday, setting up that winner-take-all rematch in Pittsburgh.\n\nMORE: Giants, Raiders overtake Titans in race for No. 1 pick in draft\n\n8. Indianapolis Colts (8-8)\n10. Miami Dolphins (7-9)\n11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-10)\n12. Kansas City Chiefs (6-10)\n13. Cleveland Browns (4-12)\n14. New York Jets (3-13)\n15. Tennessee Titans (3-13)\n16. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)\n\nThe Colts were eliminated from playoff contention before facing the Jaguars, once the Texans beat the Chargers. The Chiefs continued their freefall, suffering their fifth consecutive defeat—now without Patrick Mahomes—against the Broncos on Christmas night. The Raiders got closer to locking down the top overall drat pick in 2026.\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks, 13-3 (first place, NFC West)\n\nThe Seahawks lead the 49ers and Rams by 1.5 games in the division after their big win over the Panthers in Carolina on Sunday. They will clinch the division title with a losses or ties by both the 49ers on Sunday night and the Rams on Monday night. The Seahawks can take the No. 1 seed with a 49ers tie with the Bears and a Rams loss or tie vs. the Falcons.\n\n2. Chicago Bears, 11-4 (champions, NFC North)\n\nThe Bears clinched the division title on Saturday night before their tough road game against the 49ers on Sunday night, thanks to the Packers losing to the Ravens, which put Green Bay too far behind going into Week 18. The Bears can now focus on beating the 49ers to keep pace with the winning Seahawks in the race for the top seed.\n\n3. Philadelphia Eagles, 11-5 (champions, NFC East)\n\nThe Eagles clinched the division title in Week 16 and stayed in play for the No. 2 seed by winning a tough interconference matchup over the Bills in Buffalo. The Eagles need the Bears to have a lesser record to move up because of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n\n4. Carolina Panthers 8-8 (first place, NFC South)\n\nThe Panthers still lead the Buccaneers by a game after their home loss to the Seahawks because of the Buccaneers' road loss at the Dolphins. The division comes down to the rematch in a de facto NFC South championship game with Carolina going to Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n5. San Francisco 49ers, 11-4 (second place, NFC West)\n\nThe 49ers would be the division champions plus No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs if they beat the visiting current No. 2 Bears on Sunday night and finish a sweep of the visiting Seahawks in Week 18.\n\n6. Los Angeles Rams, 11-4 (third place, NFC West)\n\nThe Rams have clinched at least a wild-card spot but now the division title is out of their control in relation to the Seahawks and 49ers. They're looking at best finishing in second place in the West.\n\n7. Green Bay Packers, 9-6-1 (second place, NFC North)\n\nThe Packers, who clinched a wild-card berth with the Lions losing to the Vikings on Christmas, can no longer win the division title over the Bears after losing at home to the Ravens on Saturday night. They should rest their several injured key players, led by Jordan Love, in Week 18 after locking into this last playoff seed.\n\nMORE: Derrick Henry bulldozes Packers to keep Ravens' playoff hopes alive\n\nThe Buccaneers stayed alive despite their loss Sunday at the Dolphins because the Panthers also lost to the Seahawks, The division title comes down to a one-and-done in Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n8. Minnesota Vikings (8-8)\n9. Detroit Lions (8-8)\n10. Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1)\n12. Atlanta Falcons (6-9)\n13. New Orleans Saints (6-10)\n14. Washington Commanders (4-12)\n15. Arizona Cardinals (3-13)\n16. New York Giants (3-13)\n\nThe Lions were the most recent team to be eliminated with their loss to the Vikings on Christmas day, which also came with them falling into last place in the division.",

    "fullText": "NFL teams to clinch playoff spot: Updated 2025 playoff bracket after Packers punch ticket to postseason in Week 17 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2025 regular season is coming to a close. Week 17 is here, with teams only having two games left to try to make a bid for postseason contention.\n\nEntering the week, 10 of the 14 total playoff spots up for grabs across the AFC and NFC were clinched. That list grew larger on Christmas, with the Packers landing a spot in the postseason after the Lions were eliminated following their shock defeat to the Vikings. The Houston Texans also beat the Los Angeles Chargers which clinched a playoff berth for the Texans and eliminated the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe top four seeds in each conference go to the division winners, regardless of their record compared to non-division winners. The overall No. 1 seed in both the AFC and NFC will earn a first-round bye in the playoffs and will not play until the Divisional round. That team will also hold home-field advantage until the Super Bowl, assuming it does not lose before then.\n\nDivision winners will also host a wild-card game, which can provide a significant advantage over a road team forced to travel. While it may feel like only one or two major games remain, there is enough variability in the seeding that nearly every game in Week 17 played a role in a team’s clinching scenario.\n\nHere is more on the teams that have clinched a playoff berth inWeek 17.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff standings going into Week 17\n\nHeading into Week 17, 10 of the 14 playoff spots across both conferences had been clinched, and each conference was in the exact same scenario. The Houston Texans were the second team to clinch during Week 17, punching their ticket with a win over the Chargers on Saturday.\n\nThe Packers booked their trip to the playoffs despite a Week 17 defeat at the hands of Baltimore, benefiting from Detroit’s Christmas Day loss to Minnesota.\n\nBoth the Carolina Panthers and the Pittsburgh Steelers had the chance to clinch in Week 17, but both teams lost and will be playing for the division in Week 18.\n\nThere are also other playoff implications in play, with some teams able to clinch their division and lock in a top-four seed.\n\nBelow is a look at the NFL's projected playoff bracket as it stands in Week 17.\n\n1. Denver Broncos (BYE)\n2. New England Patriots vs. 7. Buffalo Bills\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. 6. Los Angeles Chargers\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers vs. 5. Houston Texans\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks (BYE)\n2. Chicago Bears vs. 7. Green Bay Packers\n3. Philadelphia Eagles vs. 6. Los Angeles Rams \n4. Carolina Panthers vs. 5. San Francisco 49ers\n\nHere's how the standings in both conferences break down in Week 17, along with the other teams that are still in the playoff hunt.",

    "description": "The Patriots travel to face the Jets on Sunday. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "4 p.m. window update: The Eagles beat the Bills courtesy of a last second stop on a Buffalo two-point conversion attempt. The Bills loss means the Patriots have clinched the AFC East title. They now will play for the No. 1 seed in Week 18.\n\nGame update: The Patriots’ blowout win over the Jets has New England on the cusp of clinching the AFC East title. If the Bills lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles later today, the Patriots will wrap up the division title.\n\nIf the Bills win that game, the Patriots will have to wait until Week 18 to clinch the division. New England would just need a win over the Miami Dolphins to clinch their first division title since 2019.\n\nNew England’s win also denied the Broncos a chance at wrapping up the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nTwo AFC East rivals meet on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\n\nOne team has already clinched a playoff spot, but the other would love to play spoiler.\n\nHere is what is at stake Sunday when the New York Jets host the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Buffalo Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. The Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the division back in Week 15 when they blew a 24-7 halftime lead to the Bills, but still remain in the driver’s seat in the division title race. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nWith the Jets already eliminated from the playoffs, this game has no tiebreaker implications between the two teams.\n\nHowever, it could play a role in the chase for the AFC East title. Right now the Patriots have a one-game lead over the Bills, and with the two teams having split the season series, the second tiebreaker is division record. New England has a 3-1 record in AFC East games (with the Jets and Miami Dolphins remaining) while the Bills are 3-2, with the Jets on the schedule in Week 18. A New England loss to the Jets opens the door to the Patriots and Bills finishing with the same division record, which would then move the AFC East title to the third tiebreaker, which is record in common games. Right now the Patriots are 9-1 in those games while the Bills are 9-2, but a loss to the Jets would drop New England to 9-2.\n\nWhich would potentially mean the AFC East title would be decided by the fourth tiebreaker, AFC record. Entering Week 17 the Bills have a better record in conference games, 8-3 versus 7-3.",

If he's not available, try for the 49ers' Kendrick Bourne or the Falcons' David Sills V, who are widely available.\n\nEagles at Bills, heavy rain: Bills receivers are risky weekly plays anyway, so Josh Allen and James Cook remain must-starts.

    "fullText": "The demolition of Hawai’i’s Aloha Stadium is finally underway after several delays.\n\nOnce home to the NFL Pro Bowl, college football’s Hawaiʻi Bowl and University of Hawaiʻi football, Aloha Stadium is transitioning into a new scaled-down stadium with an accompanying entertainment district.\n\nAs part of the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project, the new stadium is set for a projected grand opening in March 2029, and is expected to have a seating capacity of 22,500, less than half of the previous 50,000 seats it held.\n\n“The demolition/dismantling of Aloha Stadium has begun,” Aloha Stadium Authority chairman Eric Fujimoto said at the NASED monthly meeting on Dec. 18. The removal of furnishings and the subsequent dismantling of the facility are expected to take approximately 10 months.\n\nThe beginning of the demolition process marks a major milestone for a plan that has been repeatedly delayed. The reopening of the stadium was initially scheduled to be on time for the Rainbow Warriors’ football season in 2028, but was pushed back to 2029 in August of this year.\n\nBefore its final closing after years of maintenance issues, Aloha Stadium was an innovative steel-constructed venue with movable seating sections for different sports and events.\n\nHowever, the stadium, also known as the Metal Mecca, met its downfall because of that very design structure.\n\nThe steel structure was not a good match for Hawai’i’s humid climate, which led to severe, damaging rust that required frequent repairs.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the stadium with a costly history was put to rest.\n\nWith the demolition now in full swing, attention turns to the broader vision of the NASED project. The construction of the new, smaller stadium and the surrounding entertainment district is expected to cost the state $350 million.\n\nThe new Aloha Stadium’s entertainment district is expected to include 4,000 to 4,500 housing units, multiple hotels, retail and dining spaces and cultural attractions. Residential construction is projected to take place shortly after the opening of the newly renovated Aloha Stadium, as early as 2029 or 2030.\n\nDiego Rivera - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe University of Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors celebrate linebacker Jalen Smith's (3) fumble recovery during an NCAA football game against the Utah State Aggies, Saturday, October 11, 2025.\n\nAfter playing its home games at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex since the closing of Aloha Stadium, University of Hawai’i football is set to move back into the new facility in 2029 under a license agreement negotiated with Hawai’i Athletics Director Matt Elliott.\n\n“While there is still much work ahead, the progress being made gives all of us reason to be optimistic,” Elliott said in a September press release. “We are excited to see momentum building and remain committed to doing our part to bring this long-awaited vision to life.”\n\nAs demolition progresses and construction plans take shape, the NASED project ushers in a new era for Hawai’i sports.",

They remain behind the Jaguars in the AFC South, but they cannot be eliminated from division contention if the Jaguars win on Sunday. The Chargers have already clinched a playoff berth, but the loss officially eliminates them from AFC West contention. They drop to the No. 7 seed and with Houston holding the tiebreaker over them, it’s unlikely they get much higher in the seeding.\n\nHouston jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter and looked like they might cruise to victory. They never fell behind, but LA fought back and cut the lead to one possession late in the fourth quarter. Special teams miscues once again cost them in the loss. They cut the lead to 20-16 and then missed a field goal. They made a key illegal contact penalty on a third down sack and couldn’t get the ball back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have already clinched a playoff spot.\n\nThe Houston Texans can join them this weekend, starting when the two teams meet Saturday at SoFi Stadium.\n\nHere is where both the Chargers and the Texans stand in the AFC playoff race.\n\nFor the Texans, 2025 has been a tale of two seasons. Houston began the year with three straight losses and went 3-5 over the first half of the season, but a seven-game winning streak has the Texans on the cusp of a playoff berth.\n\nHouston will clinch a playoff spot with a win or a tie in that game against the Chargers.\n\nHowever, even if the Texans lose to the Chargers, they can still clinch a playoff spot on Sunday. Houston is in the playoffs if the Indianapolis Colts lose or tie against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. And speaking of the Jaguars, Houston remains alive in the race for the AFC South title. With wins in their final two games and one loss from the Jaguars down the stretch, the Texans are AFC South champions.\n\nAs for the Chargers, they locked up a playoff spot when the Indianapolis Colts lost to the San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nBut Los Angeles remains alive in the AFC West race. The Denver Broncos moved one step closer to claiming the division title on Christmas night with a win over the Kansas City Chiefs. But with a win over the Texans, the Chargers can wrap up the division title in Week 18, as they take on the Broncos in the final game of the season. A loss or a tie against Houston would eliminate the Chargers from the AFC West race.\n\nHere are the current AFC standings following Denver’s win on Thursday night:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nThis game could have an impact on seeding between the two teams, under the NFL’s tiebreaker formula. As you can see above, right now the Chargers are the No. 5 seed with an 11-4 record, but the Texans are 10-5, down in the No. 7 spot.\n\nIf Houston wins, the two teams would have matching 11-5 records. The Texans’ win would give them a tiebreaker advantage over the Chargers should they finish tied at the end of the season. However, if Houston, Los Angeles, and Buffalo all finish tied at the end of the year, then their respective conference records will be the determining factor. Entering Week 17, the Chargers have an 8-2 record in AFC games, as do the Texans, while Buffalo is 8-3.",

With that comes the matchups that will be set soon and the playoff opponents for each team.\n\nAs we enter Week 17, the results of these games will shift who plays who, and we will track that all here.\n\nThe number one see gets a first-round bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs.\n\nEntering Week 17, the Denver Broncos have a chance to clinch the number one seed but it’s going to take a lot of work. It is likely to stretch to Week 18.\n\nPittsburgh can clinch the four seed with a win OR a Ravens loss.\n\n2. New England Patriots (12-3)* host 7. Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)*\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)* host 6. Houston Texans (11-5)*\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6) host 5. Buffalo Bills (11-4)*\n\nThe NFC bracket is wide open entering Week 17, but the Seahawks can clinch the one seed with a win and some NFC West help.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers can clinch the four seed with a win and a Buccaneers loss.\n\n2. Chicago Bears (11-4)* host 7. Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)\n3. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)** host 6. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)*\n4. Carolina Panthers (8-7) host 5. San Francisco 49ers (11-4)*\n\n*: Clinched playoff berth\n**: Clinched division title\n***: Clinched no. 1 seed\n\nSaturday 4:30 p.m. result: The Texans beat the Chargers 20-16 to punch their ticket to the playoffs and keep their AFC South hopes alive. They cannot be eliminated from division contention this week if the Jaguars win on Sunday. The result also secured the AFC West title for the Broncos and leaves open the door for the Broncos to clinch the No. 1 seed. Denver is guaranteed can clinch home field through the AFC bracket if the Patriots, Jaguars, and Bills all lose on Sunday.\n\nChristmas 8:30 p.m. result: Denver’s win moved the Broncos one step closer to locking up the AFC West, and perhaps the No. 1 seed in the conference. Denver can clinch the AFC West on Saturday if the Chargers lose or tie against the Houston Texans. The Broncos can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference this weekend, but they will need a lot of help to accomplish that goal. Denver locks up the No. 1 seed with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nChristmas 4:30 p.m. result: The Lions lost to the Vikings, which officially clinched a berth for the Packers and eliminated the Lions. That solidifies all but one team in the playoff field. The Packers currently hold the final wild card berth, but still have an outside shot at the NFC North title. The seeding is not set for the six teams already in the field. The final team to join the field will be the NFC South champion, and that team is all but certain to be the No. 4 seed.\n\nWe will update as more Week 17 results come in.",

    "fullText": "Lamar Jackson injury history: A complete timeline of injuries for Ravens QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere is no doubt Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is one of the most electrifying players in the NFL when healthy, but keeping him 100% healthy has been a challenge at times.\n\nBetween MVP campaigns in 2019 and 2023, Jackson ended two seasons on the sidelines due to injury, and 2025 quickly began to get away from the Ravens when another injury struck.\n\nIt’s likely no coincidence Jackson’s fully healthy seasons have been far and away his best. After recovering from injury in 2022, Jackson returned to MVP form, winning his second MVP award in 2023 before putting together an even more impressive campaign the following season from a statistical standpoint.\n\nHere’s a look back at Jackson’s injury history and how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nMORE:Explaining the Lamar Jackson trade rumors\n\nAfter missing one game for a pre-playoff break in 2019 and another due to COVID-19 in 2020, Jackson missed his first games because of injury in 2021.\n\nWhile a non-COVID illness initially cost him a game against the Chicago Bears in 2021, Jackson went on to miss the Ravens’ final four games of the season with a significant ankle sprain. He suffered the injury early in a loss to the Cleveland Browns in Week 14, and Baltimore limped to an 0-5 finish and missed the playoffs with Jackson out of the mix.\n\nJackson struggled to match his MVP production in 2022, throwing 10 touchdowns over his first three starts but just seven over his final nine before going down with a sprained PCL in his knee.\n\nDespite being labeled week to week and hoping for a playoff return, Jackson missed the final five games of the regular season and the Ravens’ wild-card matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals. Baltimore went 3-3 without Jackson, including a playoff loss, and some wondered whether he had played his last down as a Raven with his contract set to expire after the season.\n\nAfter plenty of speculation about his future, Jackson agreed to a five-year, $260 million contract extension to remain in Baltimore long term.\n\nMORE:Inside Lamar Jackson's family tree\n\nJackson suffered a hamstring injury against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4 of the 2025 season and didn't return for a month, missing games against the Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Bears with a bye week sandwiched in-between.\n\nThe injury cost Jackson a bit longer than he hoped, as the Bears game had been targeted by the Ravens as his potential return date, but he looked every bit like himself in his return against the Miami Dolphins. Unfortunately for Jackson, that momentum did not last.\n\nAfter returning from a hamstring injury, Jackson struggled to play anything like he did in 2024, throwing four touchdowns and five interceptions across seven starts following his return against the Dolphins.\n\nIn the meantime, Jackson battled various ailments that kept him out of practices. Jackson missed practice time with injuries to his ankle, toe and knee, also missing a practice due to illness. While those injuries never kept him out of a game, his performance appeared to be impacted by them.\n\nJackson exited a prime-time game against the New England Patriots with a back contusion and did not return. He was summarily ruled out of the Ravens’ Week 17 game against the Packers. While Jackson did not receive a formal diagnosis beyond a “deep tissue bruise,” the injury was painful enough that he could not return to a pivotal game against an AFC contender.\n\nMORE: Where does Lamar Jackson rank among the 13 greatest Ravens of all time?\n\nBefore his back contusion deep into the 2025 season, Jackson missed 17 games over eight NFL seasons, including the playoffs. Here is the complete breakdown:\n\nJackson's 17 missed games include two due to pre-playoffs rest and two due to illness. His longest injury-related absence spanned six games, as Jackson missed the Ravens' final five regular season games and a playoff game with a sprained PCL in his knee in 2022.",

The Houston Texans beat the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday, which precludes Jacksonville from clinching the division title on Sunday if they beat the Colts. However, a win over Indianapolis would leave Jacksonville in first place holding a one game lead over Houston heading into Week 18.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars clinched a playoff berth this past week, but can clinch something more important in Week 17. They are in control of their fate in the AFC South and clinch the division title as soon as this week. They need a win and some help from their Houston division-mates.\n\nThe Jaguars face the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday and are 5.5-point favorites. Jacksonville will be without right guard Patrick Mekari due to a back injury, while center Robert Hainsey is questionable with a groin injury. The Colts will be without center Tanor Bortolini (concussion) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (back). Their list of questionable players includes cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and right guard Dalton Tucker (shoulder).\n\nIf the Jaguars clinch the AFC South, it would be their first playoff appearance and division title since 2022. That year, they beat the Chargers in the Wild Card round and then lost to the Chiefs in the Divisional Round. They have won their division four times prior to this sesason.\n\nThe Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win and a Texans loss or tie against the Chargers on Saturday. Houston is traveling to LA for the game and is a 1.5-point underdog.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nDenver Broncos: 13-3 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nNew England Patriots: 12-3 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nBuffalo Bills: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)",

They could clinch the top seed with some more help on Sunday, but for now they’re guaranteed a top three seed in the 2026 NFL Playoffs.\n\nUpdate (Christmas night): Denver’s win over the Chiefs on Christmas night keeps both of their scenarios alive for Week 17. The Broncos will clinch the AFC West with a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans on Saturday night. Denver can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nThe Denver Broncos travel to GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas night to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnd the Broncos can make it a wonderful Christmas for themselves and their fans with a win over their division rivals, and a little bit of help from around the rest of the league. Denver can clinch both the AFC West, and the No. 1 seed in the AFC, here in Week 17.\n\nThe Denver Broncos last won the AFC West back in 2015.\n\nPeyton Manning — yes, the guy from the commercials — was their starting quarterback.\n\nBut Denver can clinch the AFC West title this week, officially bringing to an end the Kansas City Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nNot only can Denver clinch the AFC West this weekend, but the Broncos also have a narrow path to clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC, something that again the team has not accomplished since that 2015 season.\n\nHowever, Denver would need a lot of help to wrap that up this weekend.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nSo you’re saying there’s a chance …\n\nHere are the full AFC standings heading into Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC West standings entering Week 17\n\nHere are the full AFC West standings with two weeks left in the season:\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x",

    "fullText": "The NFL has fined Chicago Bears defensive end Austin Booker for a couple of illegal hits on Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love in last Saturday night's game, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nBooker was fined $11,636 total for his two hits on Love, including one that knocked Love out of the game with a concussion. It was the more controversial call of the two considering Love lowered his helmet to initiate helmet-to-helmet contact. But Booker was flagged, and now penalized, regardless.\n\nWhen Love exited the game, the Bears defense struggled against backup quarterback Malik Willis, whose mobility proved to be an issue. But Chicago's bend-don't-break defense, coupled with quarterback Caleb Williams' fourth-quarter heroics, was able to pull off an improbable 22-16 overtime win.\n\nMeanwhile, the NFL did not fine Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon for his late hit on wide receiver DJ Moore early in the first quarter. But Moore got the last laugh as he scored the game-winning touchdown in overtime with Nixon draped over him in the end zone.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears DE Austin Booker fined for two hits on Packers QB Jordan Love",

    "fullText": "After finishing their 2024 campaign with a 6-11 record and in fourth place in the NFC West, the San Francisco 49ers knew they needed to make changes, and that's exactly what they did.\n\nSan Francisco, still led by John Lynch and Kyle Shanahan, brought in a new defensive coordinator, made impactful trades and signed free agents that they hoped would contribute.\n\nLess than a year later, the 49ers are already stamped to go to the postseason and could finish as the top team in the conference if they win their final two games of the season.\n\nLooking back at all of the moves they made during the offseason, a few stand out, and Pro Football Focus' Bradley Locker even listed the signing of backup quarterback Mac Jones as one of the 20 best free-agent signings of 2025.\n\n\"As Purdy missed eight games due to a lingering early-season toe ailment, Jones stepped up masterfully in his stead,\" Locker wrote. \"The former Patriot posted a 76.0 PFF passing grade across his eight starts, racking up an 80.1% adjusted completion rate. Indeed, Jones still ranks 16th among quarterbacks in WAR despite not playing since Week 10.\n\nPurdy’s performance of late — highlighted by his 96.6 overall mark in Week 16 — has shut down the idea that Jones could have realistically supplanted him. Still, the former first-round pick acted as a lifeline to lift the 49ers to an 11-4 record.\"\n\nSigning Jones wasn't a no-brainer at the time, as he was coming off a tough end to his time in New England and a mediocre one-year stint in Jacksonville.\n\nHowever, Jones did well in his eight starts, leading San Francisco to a 5-3 record while completing 69.6% of his passes for 2,151 yards, 13 touchdowns and six interceptions.\n\nEven better, the deal Jones signed is for two seasons, so the 49ers could keep him around for 2026 or flip him for a draft pick or another player at a position of need this upcoming offseason.\n\nMore 49ers: 49ers won't have to face top Bears WR in Week 17 matchup\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: NFL analyst says 49ers made one of the 20 best signings last offseason",

    "fullText": "The Houston Texans visit SoFi Stadium to take on the Los Angeles Chargers in a marquee Week 17 matchup today.\n\nAll eyes will be on this tape-measuring matchup, and my Texans vs. Chargers predictions are calling for this total to go Over the number.\n\nRead \n\nTexans vs Chargers Best bet: Over 39.5 (-115)\n\nThis is the lowest total of the season for the Los Angeles Chargers, and while the Houston Texans boast an elite defense, I expect both offenses to put up enough points to hit the Over on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Texans have found an offensive rhythm, averaging 25.4 points per game and ranking 11th in dropback EPA during their seven-game winning streak, hitting the Over in consecutive outings. Meanwhile, Los Angeles has also averaged 27.8 points across their past five home games.\n\nUltimately, both teams feature capable offenses led by experienced quarterbacks, and with defenses flagged so frequently week after week, it’s hard to see the Texans and Chargers going Under in ideal conditions at SoFi Stadium.\n\nHouston has surrendered the second-fewest yards and lowest EPA per play while allowing the fewest points per game and ranking second in turnover differential. The Texans also pace the NFL in pass rush win rate and rank second in run stop win rate, so there are a lot of feathers in the Houston hat.\n\nWhile the Chargers are definitely legit, I expect the makeshift Los Angeles offensive line to have its hands full on Saturday afternoon.\n\nTurning to the final leg of this same-game parlay, Houston star Nico Collins has cleared this total in six of the past eight games while averaging 5.3 receptions, 8.8 targets, and 90.1 receiving yards per game.\n\nThe Chargers haven’t been gashed through the air with the seventh-lowest yards per attempt allowed, but they have multiple cornerbacks considered day-to-day with injuries, and Collins is a matchup nightmare with a sizable 23.4% target share this season.\n\nNico Collins Over 63.5 receiving yards\n\nBolts quarterback Justin Herbert has topped this total in nine of 15 games this season, and he’s averaged 242.6 passing yards per home game this season.\n\nJustin Herbert Over 217.5 passing yards\n\nNico Collins Over 63.5 receiving yards\n\nSpread: Texans -1.5 (-105) | Chargers +1.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Texans -125 | Chargers +105\n\nOver/Under: Over 39.5 (-110) | Under 39.5 (-110)\n\nHouston has won six of its last 11 road games (+2.50 Units / 19% ROI).

    "fullText": "Broncos unlikely to break major team record which at one point seemed like a lock originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 1984 Chicago Bears are probably safe.\n\nThat season, they had 72 sacks in 16 games, still the most in NFL history. But at one point this season, the Broncos were on a torrid pace, racking up 46 sacks in their first 10 games and looking like they would shatter that mark.\n\nBut they have cooled off and after sacking Kansas City Chiefs third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun just one time on Christmas night, they will need a small miracle to break that record.\n\nThe Broncos have 64 sacks on the season and need eight to tie the Bears and nine to surpass them. They had one game this season – in Week 13 against the New York Jets– where they sacked Justin Fields nine times. But the Chargers, who the Broncos will face in Week 18, are not the Jets.\n\nIn the first meeting between the Broncos and Chargers this season, back in Week 3, the Broncos sacked Justin Herbert five times. The Chargers do have a depleted offensive line, but nine sacks is probably too much to ask for.\n\nSo what happened? Why did the Broncos' pass rush slow down?\n\nTheir opponents began to place much more focus on stopping the pass rush, realizing that the Broncos had an all-time great unit. Nik Bonitto hasn't had a sack in any of the team's last three games. Jonathon Cooper – who had seven sacks in the first nine games – has a total of one sack in the last seven games.\n\nWith that sack, the Broncos break the franchise's all time single season sack record.\n\nNew record: 64 and counting\n\n— Romi Bean (@Romi_Bean) December 26, 2025\n\nThat is the trend that the entire defense has been on. If Bonitto and Cooper are not going to threaten the quarterback, the team is not going to rack up any sacks. Over the course of the last three games, the Broncos have gotten sacks from the likes of Dondrea Tillman, Jonah Elliss, Malcolm Roach and even Riley Moss, but not their superstar edge rushers.\n\nThe 64 sacks the Broncos have gotten are already the most in franchise history and currently, good for 12th-most in league history.\n\nREAD: Houston Texans can help Broncos achieve their first goal on Saturday\n\nBut it does speak volumes for how good that Bears defense was to get 72, a mark the Broncos likely aren't going to touch, and they'll even have an extra game to do it as the Bears did that in a 16-game season while the league now runs a 17-game season.\n\nBroncos take former player from Chargers ahead of Week 18 showdown between teams\n\nBroncos hand out game ball to ironic player following big Christmas win over Chiefs\n\nBroncos earn first season sweep of Chiefs in over a decade, improve to 13-3 on the season\n\nDenver Broncos should ask Santa for these 4 things for Christmas\n\nBroncos on Christmas: Two of ugliest losses in recent team history came on the holiday",

    "fullText": "Feelings around the New Orleans Saints’ season have gone in an entirely different direction in recent weeks, and with that, their draft pick continues to fall.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (previously owned by Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (previously owned by the Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (previously owned by the Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (previously owned by the Jacksonville Jaguars)\n\nLike the past few weeks, the Saints dropping in the draft order is not the end of the world. There are still several great players available, and S Caleb Downs could be one of the top options. Safety is not a position of need for New Orleans, but this is all about the best player available and talent. Downs is one of the best players in the draft.\n\nIf positional value were removed, Downs would be in the race for #1 overall. He can play throughout the defense, is a great tackler, and plays like a cornerback in coverage. Instead of safety, where his central college position is, Downs could play slot corner for the Saints. This would both fill a need and add top-end talent to the roster. This would become an even better pick if Alontae Taylor, who is out of contract after this season, leaves in free agency.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL has delivered some fantastic matchups with huge playoff implications for Week 17. It kicks off on the Saturday doubleheader with all four organizations fighting for a postseason spot.\n\nTo start, the Los Angeles Chargers will host the Houston Texans. Then, the Baltimore Ravens will travel to legendary Lambeau to take on the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe Chargers need to win this game for any chance at claiming the AFC West. Heading into Week 17, they are two games behind the Broncos, but face Denver in Week 18. The Texans are hanging on to that last playoff spot with all they have. Luckily for them, Houston has one of the most terrifying defensive units in the entire NFL.\n\nThe Ravens are still alive to win the AFC North. Baltimore will play the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18; this game could very well determine the division. As for the Packers, they continue to shift from Super Bowl contenders to barely in the playoffs every week. The injury to Micah Parsons will no doubt hurt those championship aspirations.\n\nThe Sporting News has everything you need to know about the Chargers-Texans and Packers-Ravens, including kickoff times and broadcast information.\n\nChargers vs Texans: 4:30 p.m. ET\n\nPackers vs. Tavens: 8:00 p.m. ET\n\nSaturday's NFL slate kicks off at 4:30 p.m. ET as the Chargers host the Texans, followed by the Packers vs. Ravens at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nSaturday's Chargers-Texans matchup will be broadcast nationally on NFL Network.

    "fullText": "Amidst departures to the NCAA transfer portal and opt outs for the Citrus Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, the Texas Longhorns received some positive news for the 2026 season on Friday when junior safety Jelani McDonald announced his return for his senior campaign.\n\nAt 6’2 and 199 pounds, McDonald has prototypical size and explosiveness for the position that could allow him to become one of the first safeties taken in the 2027 NFL Draft if he stays healthy and maintains his developmental trajectory.\n\nOut of Waco Connally, McDonald was a late riser in the 2023 recruiting class, receiving his offer from the Longhorns in October when he was committed to Oklahoma State. TCU also factored into McDonald’s recruitment, hosting him for an official and unofficial visit late in the process, but it was McDonald’s time on the Forty Acres in December that ultimately sealed his decision to spurn his father’s alma mater and signed with Texas.\n\nA triple jumper, high jumper, and basketball standout at Connally, McDonald played quarterback, wide receiver, and on defense in high school, allowing him to finish the cycle as a consensus four-star prospect ranked as the No. 74 player nationally and the No. 2 athlete, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.\n\nThe athlete classification certainly fit McDonald, as it wasn’t clear whether he would grow into a linebacker in college even as he displayed the ability to play cornerback despite his height. As a freshman, McDonald m0ved between nickel back, linebacker, cornerback, and safety.\n\nWhile McDonald developed behind the scenes shuffling through positions to determine his future role, he played on three special teams units for the Horns as a true freshman, recording two tackles against Oklahoma State in the Big 12 Championship game.\n\nAs a sophomore, McDonald showed signs of becoming a rising star as he was thrust into playing time due to injuries, totaling 33 tackles, one tackle for loss, one interception, and one pass broken up with four starts over 14 games.\n\nMcDonald took another step forward as a full-time starter in 2025, leading the team in tackles with 73 (43 solo) thanks to late-season injuries sustained by redshirt senior safety Michael Taaffe and junior linebacker Anthony Hill Jr., notching four tackles for loss, three interceptions, three passes broken up, and a fumble return.\n\nWith McDonald returning, Texas has one starter back at the safety position with Taaffe exhausting his eligibility.",

Statistically, they have the worst red-zone D in the league this season.”\n\nThe Patriots are giving up a staggering 74% of touchdowns when opponents reach the red zone, making it the worst rate in the NFL.\n\nNew England will likely face a handful of powerful offenses in the postseason, and it won’t be able to compete if it doesn’t limit opposing teams to field goals.\n\nThe Patriots need to focus on improving their red zone defense over the next two weeks, especially as they face the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, both of whom will be starting backup quarterbacks.\n\nWhy NFL Writer Would’ve Loved To See Myles Garrett On Patriots This Season",

He also forced a fumble and had a pass defensed in the win. The All-Pro is tied for the team lead with four interceptions and is the only player in the NFL to have at least four interceptions in each of the past three seasons. With Sunday’s performance, he became the first player in franchise history to have a forced fumble and an interception return for a touchdown in a game.\n\nRB Omarion Hampton had 85 yards rushing and a touchdown on 16 carries against the Cowboys, his most productive showing in three games since returning from a broken ankle. The rookie first-round pick from North Carolina has 516 yards on the ground and four total touchdowns in eight games. The Chargers will need to maintain offensive balance against the outstanding Texans defense.\n\nTexans DE Will Anderson Jr. vs. Chargers' offensive line. Improved pass protection kept QB Justin Herbert from being sacked in Dallas, which in turn allowed the offense to have one of its best performances of the season. However, the difference in quality between the Cowboys’ pass rush and what Anderson and company will bring is stark. Anderson has a career-high 11 1/2 sacks, and his 17 tackles for loss have been just as important in creating obvious passing downs. He has a tackle for loss in 10 of the past 11 games and all seven road games this season.\n\nTexans: RB Woody Marks and LB Azeez Al-Shaair are set to return after missing last week’s game with injuries. … LT Aireontae Ersery is listed as questionable and could miss the game with a thumb injury. … RT Trent Brown (ankle/knee) will not play.\n\nChargers: LT Jamaree Salyer (hamstring), return specialist Derius Davis (ankle), CB Benjamin St-Juste (shoulder) and rookie S R.J. Mickens (shoulder) have all been ruled out. … DL Teair Tart (groin) and RG Mekhi Becton (knee) are questionable. The Chargers estimated Becton would have been a full participant if they had practiced Thursday, which bodes better for his availability.\n\nThe Chargers won the most recent meeting in the regular season, leaving Houston with a 34-24 triumph on Oct. 2, 2022. … The Texans are facing the Chargers at SoFi Stadium for the first time. They came up with a 27-20 victory in September 2019 in their only other trip to Los Angeles since the Chargers left San Diego in 2017.\n\nThe Texans can clinch a playoff berth with a win or tie, or a loss or tie by the Colts. … Houston’s seven-game winning streak is the longest active streak in the NFL and tied for the second longest in franchise history behind a nine-game winning streak in 2018. … DeMeco Ryans is the first head coach in franchise history to win 10 games in three consecutive seasons. … Houston’s defense leads the NFL in yards (272.3) and points (16.6) allowed. … QB C.J. Stroud has had at least 200 yards passing in five straight road games. … RB Nick Chubb had 42 yards of offense last week and had 170 yards of offense and a touchdown in his only career game against the Chargers in 2021 while with Cleveland. … WR Nico Collins had 59 yards receiving last week for his eighth straight game with at least 55 yards receiving. He had seven catches for 122 yards and a touchdown in a playoff win over the Chargers last season. … The Chargers have won 11 games in consecutive seasons for the third time in franchise history (1979-80, 2006-07). … Jim Harbaugh is one of eight NFL head coaches to have multiple 11-win seasons with two different organizations. … The Chargers defense has 13 takeaways (three fumbles, 10 interceptions) in its past six games after getting eight through its first nine games. … Justin Herbert threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns against the Cowboys, his third game this season with multiple touchdowns passes and no interceptions. … WR Ladd McConkey needs two receptions to pass Keenan Allen (148) for most in Chargers history through a player’s first two seasons. … OLB Tuli Tuipulotu got his 13th sack of the season versus the Cowboys. He can become the fifth player in Chargers history with 14 or more in a season (Khalil Mack, Shawne Merriman, Leslie O’Neal, Lee Williams). … S Derwin James Jr. needs one sack to become the third player in NFL history with 600 tackles, 20 sacks and 10 interceptions in his first 100 games (Roquan Smith, Karlos Dansby).\n\nFacing two of the strongest rush defenses in the league, neither Omarion Hampton nor Woody Marks is likely to put up big numbers on the ground. Desperate fantasy owners with limited options will have to gamble that either tailback could make up for it as outlets in the passing game, as Marks was a tremendous receiver in college and Hampton has displayed good hands in his first season.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Rams (11-4) at Atlanta (6-9)\n\nAgainst the spread: Rams 11-4; Falcons 8-7\n\nSeries record: Rams lead 49-30-2\n\nLast meeting: Rams beat Falcons 31-27 on Sept. 18, 2022, in Inglewood, Calif.\n\nLast week: Rams lost at Seattle 38-37 in overtime; Falcons won 26-19 at Arizona.\n\nRams offense: overall (1), rush (5), pass (2), scoring (1).\n\nRams defense: overall (16), rush (12), pass (19), scoring (6).\n\nFalcons offense: overall (14), rush (8), pass (17), scoring (25).\n\nFalcons defense: overall (14), rush (25), pass (8), scoring (21)\n\nTurnover differential: Rams plus-12; Falcons plus-1\n\nLB Nate Landman had five tackles, a sack and a tackle for loss in the Rams’ loss to the Seahawks. Landman, who leads the team with 123 tackles and has forced four fumbles, has been a revelation for the Rams adding range and instincts at a position they have tended not to value. Landman, who played for Atlanta in 2022-24, will be important in trying to corral Falcons RB Bijan Robinson as both a runner and receiver.\n\nRobinson leads the NFL with 131.5 scrimmage yards per game. He needs 151 scrimmage yards to break William Andrews’ team record of 2,176 set in 1983. Robinson has at least 100 combined rushing and receiving yards in 10 games this season.\n\nRams WR Puka Nacua will be a difficult matchup against a short-handed Falcons secondary. Atlanta CB Mike Hughes is expected to miss his second consecutive game with an ankle sprain, leaving undrafted rookie Cobee Bryant and backup C.J. Henderson to work with starter A.J. Terrell. Henderson was signed from the practice squad last week and had a game-saving interception at Arizona. Nacua leads the NFL with 114 catches for 1,592 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nRams:: WR Davante Adams (hamstring) and RG Kevin Dotson (ankle) could be held out as the Rams will prioritize making sure both key players are ready for the playoffs. … S Quentin Lake (elbow) will return to practice next week and could be available for the regular-season finale against the Cardinals. … CB Roger McCreary is expected to play this week after sustaining a groin injury in his Rams’ debut Nov. 23 that led to a stint on injured reserve.\n\nFalcons: Hughes was declared unlikely to return this week by coach Raheem Morris and is expected to miss his second consecutive game. ... WR Drake London (knee) was limited in practice. London returned against Arizona after missing four games. He briefly left the game against the Cardinals after appearing to aggravate the injury but Morris expressed confidence in London's status this week. CB Clark Phillips III (triceps, illness) was designated to return from injured reserve on Wednesday.\n\nThe Rams have won the past two regular-season games against the Falcons, scoring at least 31 points in both games. … The Falcons ended Rams coach Sean McVay’s first season with a 26-13 victory in the NFC wild-card round in January 2018. … Atlanta has won both postseason matchups in this series, which goes back to 1966.\n\nRams QB Matthew Stafford needs two touchdown passes in his last two games to set a single-season career high. He had 41 scoring throws in 2011 with the Detroit Lions and again in 2021 with Los Angeles. … Stafford leads the NFL with 40 TD passes with only five interceptions. ... The Rams have scored 30 points in three straight games for the first time since 2018, when they did it in four straight. … Nacua had a career-high 225 yards receiving in the loss to the Seahawks. It was his third straight game with over 100 yards and sixth of the season. … The previous time the Rams led the league in scoring was in McVay’s first season as head coach in 2017. They have done it six times since the AFL-NFL merger. … TE Colby Parkinson has six touchdown receptions this season and needs one more to set the Rams’ single-season record at the position. … DL Kobie Turner got his first career interception against the Seahawks. Turner needs 2 1/2 sacks in his last two games to set a career high; he had nine sacks as a rookie in 2023. … Morris was the Rams defensive coordinator from 2021-23. ... Atlanta assistant coaches who previously worked on McVay's staff in Los Angeles: offensive coordinator Zac Robinson (2019-23), pass game specialist/game management Tim Berbenich (2023), offensive assistant K.J. Black (2022-23), assistant offensive line coach Nick Jones (2021-23) and director player performance John Griffin (2021-23). ... The Falcons rank second in the league with 50 sacks, five away from their team record of 55 set in 1997. ... Three of the Falcons' six wins came in prime-time games against Minnesota, Buffalo and Tampa Bay. Atlanta lost a prime-time game at San Francisco.\n\nFalcons TE Kyle Pitts has at least six catches in four straight games, including seven for 57 yards and a touchdown last week. His 395 receiving yards in the past four games are the most by a tight end in a four-game span in franchise history. Pitts has set career highs with 80 catches and five touchdown receptions this season and has been especially effective with Kirk Cousins at quarterback.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "A Florida man shot and killed his wife and shot his stepdaughter earlier this week before fatally shooting himself after an argument over an NFL game, authorities said.\n\nJason Kenney, 47, took his own life hours after killing his wife, Crystal Kenney, Dec. 22, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a press conference.\n\nJudd said the murder occurred after Crystal Kenney suggested to her husband that he turn off Monday’s NFL game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFlorida Man Facing Death Penalty For Killing 18-Year-old Girlfriend, Unborn Child After She Refused Abortion\n\nJason Kenney had been drinking, and the argument escalated, prompting his wife to tell her 12-year-old son to call 911.\n\nThe boy ran to a neighbor’s home when he heard gunshots. Responding deputies found Crystal Kenney dead and a 13-year-old girl who had been shot in the shoulder and face.\n\nShe is recovering in a hospital.\n\n\"She said, ‘I begged him, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, and he shot me anyway,’\" Judd said.\n\nArkansas Mom Found Shot To Death With Two Children Wrote Cryptic Facebook Post Months Before Killings\n\nThe boy was unharmed, as was Jason and Crystal’s 1-year-old daughter, who was home at the time of the shooting. She was found by deputies asleep in her crib.\n\nAfter the shooting, Jason Kenney fled and called his sister, who lives in upstate New York, Judd said. He told her he had \"done something\" wrong and that it would be the last time they would talk.\n\nHe then drove to his father’s home, where deputies found him. As deputies attempted to get him out of a shed, Jason fatally shot himself, Judd said.\n\nDuring a search of the family’s home, deputies found a note Crystal wrote to her husband urging him to get help.\n\n\"You’re drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God,\" the note states, Judd said.\n\nThe surviving children are in the custody of grandparents.\n\n\"The entire family was destroyed,\" Judd said. \"Our homicide detectives are distraught. When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under it, just like the nuclear family should be.\"\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — From the moment they hit the gridiron, Mike and Blake Bell were inseparable.\n\nFor two identical twin brothers, a bond could be centered around anything, but for the Bell boys it was always football.\n\nFor nearly their entire lives, they were on the same team. In high school both attended Bishop Carroll, in college they both played for Colorado State, but on draft day things took a turn. Taken second overall by the Chiefs, Mike made Mark a promise.\n\n“The sports information guy said I needed to get over to Kansas City, and I told them, I wasn’t leaving until Mark got drafted,” said Mike Bell.\n\nAfter three rounds, Mark eventually got drafted in the fourth. In a time crunch, Mike would have to leave for Kansas City, but on the way there, he quickly learned that Mark was taken by an AFC West rival.\n\nMaize senior shooting guard leads by example on and off the field\n\n“I’m flying to Kansas City, and as I’m getting off the plane, the pilot comes out and says, I just wanna let you know they radioed up and your brother got drafted to the Seahawks,” said Mike Bell.\n\nThe two faced off twice a year on the opposite side of the ball, with Mike eventually getting the best of Mark in their NFL debut.\n\n“The first play wasn’t that good for me,” Mark said laughingly. “We had some really great memories, though. My mom and dad and the whole family would bring a bus down to Arrowhead to come watch us play, it was really special.”\n\nAnd with all of those great memories, come a legacy that the two brothers will share forever.\n\n“They remember us as the football guys, even though we’ve done different things since then, it’s amazing how that kind of follows you and it just goes with you for your whole life,” said Mike Bell.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

    "fullText": "When the NFL schedule makers sat down to craft the Christmas slate of games, they likely envisioned the clash between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs as a battle for the AFC West title.\n\nWhile the Chiefs have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Broncos can wrap up their first AFC West title since 2015 with a win tonight, and a little bit of help from the Houston Texans on Saturday. In addition, Denver can also secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but they will need a little more help here in Week 17 to clinch the top seed.\n\nLet’s start with the AFC West title. Denver can clinch the division title this week, officially bringing to an end the Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nIn addition, Denver can also wrap up the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week, and the lone bye week in the AFC playoffs.\n\nBut they would need a lot of help to get that done.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWith the Chiefs already eliminated from the playoffs, this game will not have any tiebreaker implications for the Chiefs and Broncos directly.\n\nBut it could play a role for the Broncos when it comes to seeding, in a very narrow scenario.\n\nLooking at the AFC West, the Broncos lead the division with a 12-3 record, while the Chargers are in second place with an 11-4 record. If Denver beats the Chiefs and the Chargers beat the Texans on Saturday, the two teams will meet in Week 18 with the division title up for grabs.\n\nWhy? Because the Chargers against Denver earlier this season, and another win in Week 18 in this scenario, would see the two teams finish at 13-4. The first tiebreaker in a division is head-to-head record, which woudl give the Chargers the AFC West title.\n\nThen the Broncos would be seeded somewhere from No. 5 to No. 7, depending on how the Bills finish, who could also end the year with a 13-4 record. If, again in this scenario, the Bills finish with the same 13-4 record as Denver, the tiebreaker will be conference record. Right now, Buffalo is at 8-3, and they have one AFC game remaining so they would finish at 9-3 in this scenario.\n\nDenver right now has a 7-3 record in AFC games, and would finish at 8-4 in this scenario, dropping them behind the Bills.\n\nAgain, this is a very specific hypothetical, but this game could matter in a tiebreaker scenario.",

    "fullText": "LSU Tigers star safety AJ Haulcy is ending his college football career as he declares for the NFL draft, per Hayes Fawcett of On3Sports.\n\nLike teammate Mansoor Delane, Haulcy transferred to the Tigers this past season with hopes of getting more eyes on him and building up his draft stock. Both players succeeded in big ways.\n\nHaulcy led LSU in tackles this past season with 88. He also added three interceptions, four passes broken up, and a forced fumble. He held his own in coverage and was a thumper in the run game. There's nothing else the Tigers could have asked him to do.\n\nThere was a four-week stretch where he finished with at least 12 tackles in each game. It felt like he was involved in every play that went into the box. His best individual game was in the losing effort against the Texas A&M Aggies, when he had 12 tackles with an interception and a pass break up.\n\nThe Texas native is a major college football success story. He came out of high school as a three-star recruit. 247Sports had him ranked as the 150th best safety in that class and the 266th best player in his home state.\n\nHe was viewed with more respect as a transfer, but he still ended up outplaying those expectations. He was the 151st player in the portal and the third-ranked safety. Now, he's going to be one of the first safeties taken in the NFL draft, receiving some second-round evaluations.\n\nHaulcy now becomes the third player from this Tigers team to declare for the draft, joining Delane and Aaron Anderson.",

    "fullText": "Chiefs vs. Broncos live score, updates, highlights from 2025 NFL Christmas game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Broncos\n\nThe NFL on Christmas Day delivers an AFC West rivalry matchup unlike any seen in the last decade, as the Denver Broncos (12-3) travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs (6-9) at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nIn a stunning reversal of roles, the Broncos enter as the dominant force, aiming to secure the AFC West title and remain firmly in the driver's seat for the conference's crucial No. 1 overall seed and the coveted first-round bye. With the Los Angeles Chargers breathing down their necks, a victory over the crippled Chiefs would officially clinch the AFC West for Denver, ending Kansas City's unprecedented nine-year reign as division champions and marking this holiday game as perhaps the most significant in Denver's last ten years.\n\nFor the three-time defending AFC Champion Chiefs, this prime-time holiday slot is a bittersweet stage for an unfamiliar role. Having already been officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era, the Chiefs have seen their season completely unravel, suffering a losing record for the first time since 2012. The franchise is currently battling devastating injuries, with Mahomes and his backup Gardner Minshew both sidelined by ACL injuries, leaving the offense to be managed by third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun. The team that was once the gatekeeper of the AFC has become a hollow shell of its dynasty self.\n\nThe stark contrast in stakes presents a unique challenge to the streaking Broncos, who must overcome a late-season loss to the Jaguars that snapped their 11-game winning streak. Head Coach Sean Payton is stressing focus, emphasizing that despite the Chiefs' struggles, a division title and the No. 1 seed are still their stated goals. A win in Kansas City, where the Broncos have historically struggled, would not only solidify their resurgence but would also serve as the ceremonial passing of the torch, ushering in a new era of dominance in the AFC West.\n\nThis Christmas night contest marks a seismic shift in the AFC power structure. What was once the annual, late-season coronation of the Chiefs is now the potential crowning moment for the Broncos — a team ready to reclaim the top spot in the AFC West and send a clear message to the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Chiefs vs. Broncos on Christmas.
