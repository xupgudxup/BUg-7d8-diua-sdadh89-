    "fullText": "Michael Irvin had a serious problem with San Francisco hosting Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHall of Famer Michael Irvin criticized San Francisco as the worst Super Bowl LX host he’s experienced, urging the league never to return the championship game to the Bay Area.\n\nIn a recent YouTube video, Irvin said the game at Levi’s Stadium was overshadowed by a lackluster host-city experience. He described the week as “blah” and said San Francisco “just wasn’t jumping” like a Super Bowl city should.\n\n“This was a horrible Super Bowl,” Irvin said. “They should never ever, ever, ever bring the Super Bowl back to San Francisco. In all the years of going to a Super Bowl, this was the worst.”\n\nIrvin spent the week leading up to the game working Radio Row at Moscone Center and attending league- and sponsor-run events across the city. He said the atmosphere around those festivities, from the streets to the parties didn't match the magnitude of the big game.\n\n“The people, blah. The buildings out here looked blah. When you go into events it was blah,” Irvin said. “I’m thinking there should be so much money out here because the tech is out here, right? But it all looks so blah.”\n\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion also criticized traffic and street closures in downtown San Francisco, saying it was nearly impossible to get around during the days leading up to the game.\n\n“I hope the people of San Fran don’t hate me for it, because I’ve had great times here,” Irvin said. “But this, no more. You cannot bring the Super Bowl back here anymore.”\n\n49ers trade rumor is bad news for Steelers, Vikings, Dolphins, Jets\n\nTyreek Hill teases possible reunion with Chiefs after Dolphins release\n\nDolphins trade rumor could lead to deal with Cowboys or Lions\n\nGiants, Lions, Raiders get good news from Ravens free-agent rumor\n\nSteelers rumor suggests Pittsburgh could make 'surprise' offseason move",

    "description": "With the NFL combine near, here is a look at which running backs were invited and a positional breakdown from the Indianapolis Colts' perspective.",
    "fullText": "The NFL combine begins soon, running from Feb. 23 to March 2. To preview this important pre-draft event, we will be taking a position-by-position look at which prospects were invited and the level of need that the Indianapolis Colts have at each spot.\n\nThe NFL combine is held at Lucas Oil Stadium and is an opportunity for the top NFL draft prospects in this year’s class to go through measurements and various on-field drills, some of which are specific to their position group, and others measure the player’s overall athleticism.\n\nFor NFL teams, this event is another data point for them as they build out their draft profiles and big boards. However, it’s a significant data point, with players potentially flying up and down draft boards depending on how they perform.\n\nIn addition to the on-field drills, teams also get the opportunity to meet with players one-on-one as well, which is another important part of the evaluation process as they get to know them both on and off the field.\n\nTaylor is still under contract through 2026, so the need remains relatively low. With Taylor still just 27 years old, he could be a potential contract extension candidate this offseason.\n\nHowever, while the need at running back may not be high, the Colts could still make an addition here. Adding an inexpensive veteran option in free agency or a mid to late round pick in the draft to bolster the depth and competition behind Taylor could be on Chris Ballard's radar.\n\nBentley was on the practice squad last season, and Giddens was often inactive, still needing to develop parts of his game, particularly in pass protection.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Indianapolis Colts' 2026 NFL combine preview: running backs",

    "description": "Should the Tennessee Titans re-sign OT Oli Udoh? Previewing NFL Free Agency for GM Mike Borgonzi.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Music City Miracles’ Tennessee Titans 2026 NFL Free Agency Primer! The negotiating window period begins on March 9th, but the Titans are able to re-sign their own free agents before then. General manager Mike Borgonzi is equipped with more than $100 million in cap space and will collaborate with new head coach Robert Saleh on their shared vision for the 2026 Titans.\n\nThe Titans are currently scheduled to possess 29 free agents (19 unrestricted), including several key starters and role players. Over the next few weeks, we’ll take an in-depth look at each free agent and provide arguments for why the Titans should, or shouldn’t re-sign that player. We’ll also offer our final verdict and a prediction to go along with our analysis.\n\nToday, we’re analyzing offensive tackle Oli Udoh.\n\nUdoh ended up playing a valuable swing role for the Titans behind starters JC Latham and Dan Moore Jr. As far as backup tackles go, he performed reasonably well. Pro Football Focus assigned identical overall and pass-blocking grades of 55.0. The Titans’ offense rarely suffered specifically because Udoh was in the lineup.\n\nPFF also credited Udoh with allowing 19 pressures, three sacks, and being whistled for six penalties. That’s a fair amount of negative plays for a tackle who earned just 274 reps at left and right tackle. Perhaps the Titans could identify a more suitable reserve tackle in free agency.\n\nSpotrac does not have a projected contract for Udoh. He signed a one-year, $1,170,000 million contract with the Titans last offseason. An extension would probably be in a similar range, maybe with a slight raise in pay.\n\nThe Titans should re-sign Udoh. His level of play improved as the campaign progressed forward. Udoh wasn’t a drive-killer when he entered games, and that’s the realistic expectation for reserve tackles. The former Elon standout was even better than recent starters at tackle for the Titans like Dennis Daley, Nicholas Petit-Frere, and Andre Dillard.\n\nThe Titans re-sign Udoh to another one-year contract.",

    "description": "The NFL is inching toward the 2026 NFL Combine, so you better believe mock drafts are flying all over the […]",
    "fullText": "The NFL is inching toward the 2026 NFL Combine, so you better believe mock drafts are flying all over the place. And with the Minnesota Vikings holding the 18th overall pick, NFL.com’s Daniel Jeremiah believes Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores will scoop a Harrison Smith replacement: Oregon safety Dillon Thieneman.\n\nNFL.com ties Minnesota to Thieneman as the Smith succession plan, signaling a 2026 secondary transition.\n\nIt’s not yet clear whether Smith will retire, but if so, Thieneman might have the juice to fill his shoes.\n\nAnother mock draft for the Vikings — more defense.\n\nJeremiah: Thieneman to Vikings at No. 18\n\nBecause Lewis Cine didn’t pan out and the fact that Smith may indeed retire soon, Minnesota will need a safety for the long haul. Jeremiah thinks Thieneman is the right guy.\n\nHe wrote Tuesday, “After studying Thieneman’s impressive 2025 tape at Oregon, I went back and watched the film from his career at Purdue, where he played in 2023 and ’24. His range and playmaking skills were evident back then, too. He would be an excellent replacement for Harrison Smith.”\n\nJeremiah continued the defensive trend for the Vikings’ spot in mock drafts. Most editions have the club selecting a defensive back or defensive lineman.\n\nThieneman is 6’0 and 200 pounds and will turn 22 in August. He’s known for his versatility at safety, which sounds like a page from the Smith playbook. His ball-tracking is elite for a rookie prospect, and he is known for high football IQ. NFL.com recently compared him to Jevon Holland, a safety for the New York Giants.\n\nA to Z Sports‘ Rob Gregson on Thieneman: “You turn on three years’ worth of tape from Thieneman, and it just gets better and better. After bursting on to the scene as a true freshman in 2023, where he recorded six interceptions, Thieneman then led the Big-10 in tackles in 2024, before doing a little bit of everything for the Ducks in 2025.”\n\n“You’re betting on instincts and explosion with Thieneman. He may not be elite laterally and challenged in terms of his man coverage projection, but if you need a player who can play the high post, poach the middle as a robber, and align as a box safety for a plus one help in the run game, Thieneman is your guy.”\n\nNFL.com’s Lance Zierlein: “Savvy three-year starter with NFL size, speed and alignment versatility. Thieneman is an extension of his defensive coordinator, aligning and adjusting the secondary to motion and pre-snap shifts. He’s an instinctive, rangy safety who can roll down into big nickel or robber positioning.”\n\n“He has a good feel for play design and route concepts in zone but has average change of direction to match breaks in man. He’s not a big thumper near the line, but he rushes into the action with a relentless pursuit that should allow him to keep stacking high scores in the tackle columns. Thieneman checks important boxes for teams looking to add versatile playmakers in the secondary.”\n\nThe 2026 Safeties + a Smith Verdict\n\nIf one pretends that Smith will indeed retire, Minnesota’s safety group would look like this in 2026 with Thieneman:\n\nIt’s also worth noting that, as of February 18th, there’s been no official retirement announcement from Smith, which is a bit odd. He can still call it quits, but with each day that passes, Smith is more likely to return for Year No. 15, especially with Flores back in the saddle as the defensive coordinator.\n\nThieneman ranks No. 37 on the Consensus Big Board at the time of this article’s publication. He might be a 2nd-Round commodity. If the Vikings don’t reach and pick him at No. 18, the team’s draftboard might resemble this, based on the best player available and long-term roster need:\n\nEmmanuel McNeil-Warren (S, Toledo)\n\nKayden McDonald (DT, Ohio State)\n\nJordyn Tyson (WR, Arizona State)\n\nThe NFL draft is about nine weeks away. Minnesota has at least nine picks line up this cycle — four more than last year, when the club had a skimpy cupboard due to the expensive Dallas Turner trade in 2024.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this year, domestic violence allegations against Chiefs receiver Rashee Rice surfaced on Instagram. New allegations have emerged against Rice in a lawsuit that was initiated earlier this week.\n\nVia James Newell of The Athletic, the civil complaint filed Monday in Dallas County District Court includes the following contentions: \"Defendant Rashee Rice and Plaintiff Dacoda Jones lived together. Following an escalation in violent behavior, in December, 2023, Defendant Rashee Rice strangled Plaintiff Dacoda Joans [sic] at their shared home in Victory Park, Texas. Defendant Rashee Rice continued to repeatedly assaulted Dacoda Jones over the course of their relationship through July, 2025. Defendant Rice has grabbed, choked, strangled, pushed, thrown, scratched, hit, and headbutted Ms. Jones, as well as hit her with inanimate objects. Additionally, he has engaged in other violent and abusive behaviors towards Ms. Jones, including throwing objects, destroying property, punching walls, and breaking furniture, as well as locking her out in the middle of the night. Many of these behaviors occurred while Ms. Jones was pregnant.\"\n\nThe league previously commenced a review based on the allegations from Instagram. The league undoubtedly will expand the investigation to include the claims made in the new lawsuit.\n\nRice served a six-game suspension to start the 2025 season, following a guilty plea to a March 2024 street-racing incident. His history could result in enhanced penalties, if the league finds he violated the Personal Conduct Policy again.\n\nThe situation also potentially impacts Rice's probation resulting from the street-racing incident. The agreement was announced in July; if any potential abuse occurred after the five-year period of probation commenced, he could face an argument that he violated the terms of his probation.",

    "fullText": "As the Detroit Lions continue to balance a win-now roster with long-term cap flexibility, it’s no surprise to see several key contributors showing up in early 2026 NFL free agency rankings.\n\nAccording to Daniel Popper of The Athletic, three Lions defenders landed inside his positional rankings ahead of the 2026 offseason, a reminder that Detroit’s depth and development on defense hasn’t gone unnoticed around the league.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the Lions players who made the list and what it could mean for Brad Holmes’ offseason decisions.\n\nVeteran linebacker Alex Anzalone checks in at No. 49 overall in Popper’s rankings, with a projected contract of two years, $21 million.\n\nAnzalone has quietly been one of the most reliable pieces of Detroit’s defense over the past five seasons. He’s averaged nearly 100 tackles per year with the Lions and continues to thrive as a rangy, athletic off-ball linebacker.\n\nPopper highlights Anzalone’s speed, coverage versatility, and pass-rush value, noting that his 29.0% pressure rate ranked second among all off-ball linebackers. While he may not be the most physical run defender, his ability to blitz, cover, and diagnose plays keeps him highly valuable — especially in modern defenses.\n\nComing in at No. 79, edge rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad is projected by Popper to command a two-year, $18 million deal.\n\nMuhammad put together a breakout 2025 season, finishing with 11 sacks, the most among Detroit’s impending free agents. While he doesn’t have elite size or athletic traits for an edge defender, his efficiency stands out.\n\nPopper points to Muhammad’s ability to win late in reps, strong hand usage, and consistent pressure, noting that he ranked 14th in pressure rate among players with at least 250 pass-rush snaps.\n\nThat production makes him an ideal situational pass rusher — the kind of player teams covet for third-down packages.\n\nDefensive tackle Roy Lopez lands at No. 107 in the rankings, with a projected two-year, $12 million contract.\n\nLopez isn’t flashy, but his value lies in doing the dirty work. Popper describes him as a stout, technically sound nose tackle who can hold ground against double teams while still offering some interior push on passing downs.\n\nFor a Lions defense that has emphasized toughness and gap integrity up front, Lopez’s ability to stack blockers and control the interior has been quietly important.\n\nSeeing three Lions defenders ranked by Daniel Popper reinforces just how many tough decisions Detroit may face in the 2026 offseason. Retaining all three won’t be easy, especially with cap constraints looming, but each player fills a specific role that aligns with Dan Campbell’s defensive identity.\n\nWhether Brad Holmes chooses to re-sign, replace, or reshuffle these spots, one thing is clear: the rest of the league is paying attention to Detroit’s talent pipeline — and it’s going to cost real money to keep it intact.\n\nThe post 3 Detroit Lions Included in 2026 NFL Free Agency Rankings appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Birmingham City have confirmed the sale of their women’s team to Shelby Companies Limited (SCL).\n\nThe Championship club, owned by Americans Tom Wagner and NFL legend Tom Brady, announced that SCL combined with several independent investors to complete the purchase.\n\nSCL have acquired a 97% stake in the team, while the remaining three per cent was purchased by a group of independent investors.\n\nThis group includes popular businesswomen and world-renowned sporting icons.\n\nOne of the biggest names on the board is Birmingham and England Lionesses legend Karen Carney.\n\nCarney is one of the most respected figures in club football. She represented England 144 times during an outstanding international career.\n\nSince retiring from football, she has become a familiar and trusted voice on television, working as a pundit and commentator for broadcasters including ITV and TNT Sports.\n\nAnother high-profile investor in the Championship club is former World Tennis Association (WTA) number one Kim Clijsters.\n\nClijsters won multiple Grand Slam titles during a remarkable tennis career.\n\nOne of her most memorable achievements came at the US Open. She won the tournament as an unseeded player after stepping away from tennis to become a mother.\n\nClijsters was also appointed Honorary President of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nBirmingham believe that the acquisition will “elevate the focus on the women’s team and help it to deliver on the stated ambition for the Club to compete at the highest levels in the women’s game”.\n\nThe new ownership group has decided against making immediate changes, so the current leadership team will continue running the day-to-day operations at the club.\n\nThe Birmingham City Women’s Football Club Board said: “The ambition is to go beyond anything that Birmingham City Women has achieved before – domestically and internationally.\n\n“And in the process, inspire a new generation of young girls, who will get the opportunity to perform in the planned women’s stadium within the Birmingham Sports Quarter.\n\n“This transaction will be a catalyst to make it happen.”",

    "description": "Here are some potential targets if the Eagles move off Jahan Dotson and explore free agency to find a replacement.",
    "fullText": "The life of a slot receiver on a Nick Sirianni-led Philadelphia Eagles team can be pretty uneventful. Sure, you're on the field, but for the most part, you're seen as expendable. Shortly after entering the NovaCare Complex, you were told that A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert will get the lion's share of targets.\n\nJahan Dotson's fate seemed sealed once we learned that Philadelphia was declining the fifth-year option on his rookie deal. There's been no extension announced, so we're going to assume we've seen his last game in an Eagles jersey. Here are a few options if free agency is explored to find a replacement.\n\nMaybe he's too rich for the Eagles' blood. Maybe he's less expensive than exercising Dotson's fifth-year option would have been. Who knows? One thing is certain. Alec Pierce is more than likely on the lists of every NFL team that will shop for a new wide receiver on the open market.\n\nDeebo Samuel doesn't have much left. Jauan Jennings seems to be too rich for Philadelphia's blood (and that's if he gets out of San Francisco). Rashid Shaheed is, seemingly, however, everything that Quez Watkins was supposed to become.\n\nHe has the hands that Watkins never had. Hmmm... Did Shaheed even drop a pass this season? Oh, and by the way, he's a nice option to return kicks, something the Eagles struggled with last season.\n\nIf Romeo Doubs were to land in Philadelphia, he might change Coach Sirianni's mind about ignoring the third receiver. This young man is too good to ignore.\n\nHe consistently wins contested catches, but sometimes that's a sign of something else. 'Contested catches' can sometimes mean guys are struggling to get open.\n\nEverything we've seen from Wan'Dale Robinson has come from seeing him play on an NFC East rival's roster. Often, he has had to do that without decent quarterback play. The G-Men added Jaxson Dart, and that helped. He had the best season of his career with Malik Nabers out.\n\nRobinson notched 92 receptions, 1,014 yards, and four TDs. He averages 9.2 yards per reception for his career, so he hasn't traveled very far down the field for the most part, but in this offense, the underneath stuff might be all that he needs to do.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Free Agency: 4 targets Eagles could sign to replace Jahan Dotson",

    "fullText": "On Friday, the NFL Players Association fired long-time security officer Craig Jones, whose eloquent email challenging the state of union leadership emerged last year, during the quickly-unfolding turmoil that resulted in the abrupt resignation of NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell.\n\nAfter being fired, Jones sent a new email to various current and former NFLPA employees. PFT has obtained a copy of the email, and has verified its authenticity.\n\nBecause Jones speaks directly to players in his email, and because plenty of players visit this space from time to time, we've decided to post the message in full.\n\nBefore posting, we invited the NFLPA to respond to all or any portion of it. The union declined to comment.\n\nHere's the full content of the Craig Jones email:\n\n\"Good day. My name is Craig Hampton Jones, and for 17 1/2 years, I was in the employ of the NFLPA. I served the union and the players we served with professional carriage, dedication, and with an enthusiasm for excellence. Through the years, I earned the respect of my peers and the players we served.\n\n\"On Jan. 18, 2026, I was informed that I was being placed on administrative leave for sending emails. On Feb. 13 2026 while in the throes of a family member being murdered on Jan. 25, while caring for my 94 year old mother who suffers with dementia, I received an email from Kim Murray that I was terminated immediately for sending emails deemed antagonistic.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Lloyd Howell's debacle and resignation, I sent an all staff email asking how we as a union move forward, cleansed of the miasma of Lloyd Howell's strip club schemes to undermine the NFLPA if chief architects of those schemes were still employed at the NFLPA.\n\n\"Another email that was deemed antagonistic was asking Jalen Maybin how you chose a new Executive Director with the same obvious flawed format that chose Lloyd Howell. My query was deemed antagonistic. But on Feb. 3, 2026, at the NFLPA press conference, 42 minutes in, Mike Jones of [The Athletic] asked Mr. Maybin, the exact same question I asked Mr. Maybin. At the same press conference, 54 minutes in Johnathan Jones of CBS Sports asked Mr. Maybin as well about the integrity of a selection process that is done 'oscuro.' My termination is nothing more than retaliation because I spoke simple truths to corrupt jaundice power. I couldn't stand silently by and watch the undermining of a storied union dedicated to the players whose trust we had earned with employees of commitment and a consistent well spring of results for our players.\n\n\"Charlatans bought in by Lloyd Howell in his attempt to pimp like Anamika Gupta and Matt Curtin, still lurk the halls of the NFLPA. And to make matters worse, the eunuch-esque leadership of David White and Jaylen Maybin and the jaded leadership of the HR department, morale is low in absence of prodigious leadership akin to Gene Upshaw and DeMaurice Smith.\n\n\"But players of today and storied players of yesteryear . . . don't despair or lose faith in the NFLPA.\n\n\"Even though the loyal workforce was eviserated [sic] unjustly by the Lloyd Howell banana republic and his leftover operatives still attempt to contaminate, please know players that there is still a small collective of honest, hardworking ethical staff who on most nights take their work on your behalf home with them because their regard for the players they behold as sacred.\n\n\"And despite the stench that still permeates in the ranks of some executive leadership, the rank and file of the employees who champion player concerns have faith that one day soon, players will again step up to preserve their gains and perform an exorcism within NFLPA executive leadership. The players once again becoming truly their brothers keeper will restore the union back to its illustrious mission. Always know players... with men of courage and altruism at the helm of leadership, the employees will ensure that you will never walk alone.\n\n\"To my former co-workers whom I hold so dear...you know who you are. I genuflect in your honor on how you continue unselfishly you to serve players with unwavering verve and professional aplomb as executive ineptitude swirls still around you. Don't despair. Muhammad Ali once told me, 'the deeper the pressure, the greater the poise.' You will always be cherished.\n\n\"I love you. Please remember what I always told you that I will always protect you so you can get home to your loved one's first, then I can go home to my love ones. Don't worry about me. No go fund me. I will for free any day protect what is right for free. As a prostate cancer survivor, I have no fear of the folly of fragile egotistical men. Tim Christine. I will always be indebted to the quasar light of your leadership. Finally to Don Davis and Zamir Cobb. I wish you well. You could have stood up for me.\n\nThe email strongly suggests that Jones will be exploring his options for a possible legal challenge to the termination. The union currently is defending a lawsuit filed by former in-house counsel Heather McPhee.\n\nAgain, the NFLPA has declined to comment on the termination of Jones, or as to the contents of his email.",

    "description": "The NFL's franchise tag window opened on Tuesday. Will the Broncos use one this offseason?",
    "fullText": "Beginning today, NFL teams are allowed to place one-year franchise (or transition) tags on one player ahead of the 2026 season. The deadline to place a one-year tag is March 3.\n\nIf a player is tagged, they have until July 15 to reach a long-term extension. If no extension is reached before that date, the player will spend the 2026 season on a one-year tag deal.\n\nDue to the high salaries associated with the tags, the Denver Broncos seem very unlikely to use one this offseason. The team's most notable pending free agent on offense is running back J.K. Dobbins, but the cost to franchise tag a running back is $14,536,000.\n\nThe club's most notable defensive player is defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers. Depending on whether he's categorized as a defensive end or defensive tackle, JFM's tag would be either $27,322,000 or $26,311,000. Either figure would likely be far out of Denver's offseason budget.\n\nDobbins might be a candidate to re-sign on a team-friendly, one-year deal, but it looks like JFM will be allowed to test the open market next month. The Broncos are not expected to tag either player before the March 3 deadline.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL free agency: Will Broncos use franchise tag in 2026?",

That doesn’t that is enough for the empire Roger Goodell has helped expand.\n\nAfter NBC and the NBA agreed to a contract for Sunday Night basketball, it was revealed the NBA will be paid $2.45B per year.

It’s clear the NFL product is much more valuable. Is it worth a fuss over $450M margin?\n\nAfter all, the league is doing plenty well both in the owners’ and player’s pockets.

For the past two years, the NFLPA has released report cards grading every single franchise from locker rooms, equipment, stadium and many more factors. Arizona hasn’t graded well in these reports, but the NFL stepped and filed a grievance against the NFLPA from publicizing these criticisms of teams and owners, and winning in the process.\n\narbitrator Scott E.

    "fullText": "Three-year NFL veteran and safety for the Cleveland Browns, Ronnie Hickman, was assaulted by a group of four individuals following a confrontation in the lobby of a Sixty Les hotel located on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York. The incident occurred at approximately 4:30 am after a group of individuals, who remain unidentified, approached Hickman shortly after he entered the building.\n\nAccording to the local authorities who originally spoke with the New York Post, police are actively investigating the matter, as well as whether or not Hickman’s status as a professional athlete had any influence in their decision to approach him. “The suspects slugged Hickman and took off,” the official report states.\n\nThe franchise itself confirmed that Hickman “was a victim of assault early Monday morning at a New York City hotel,” and a personal representative of the Ohio State product also informed the post that “Ronnie was treated for minor injuries at an area hospital after the incident, was later released, and is home resting with his family.”\n\nThe incident, unfortunately, comes right after Hickman had managed to enjoy a career-defining breakout. After recording just 70 total tackles with the Browns throughout all of 2023 and 2024, he managed to finally become a full-time starter in 2025.\n\nThe 2023 undrafted free agent tallied 103 combined tackles throughout his 17 starts this past season, snagging two interceptions and deflecting seven passes along the way. At this time, police have admitted that no arrests have been made and that all four of the primary suspects remain at large.\n\nStaff members who were on site at the time of the assault have also refused to offer up any sort of comments on the issue, but given the upscale nature of the establishment, it’s widely speculated that Hickman may have been profiled. The 24-year-old prospect is set to become a restricted free agent later this offseason, and will likely be resigning with the Browns for a “projected contract between $7 million to $8 million.”\n\nABC7 has suggested that Hickman was, in fact, identified by the four individuals, and that things only escalated after Hickman refused to acknowledge them, but that has yet to be confirmed by either official sources or any of the members in Hickman’s camp.\n\nThe post Cleveland Browns News: Ronnie Hickman Attacked by Goons in Sixty Les Hotel’s Lobby, No Arrests Yet appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Who do you want the Eagles to draft?",
    "fullText": "Some of us may have the day off, but mock drafts never do.\n\nAfter a brief pause in 2024, Howie Roseman got back to trading first-round picks last year. He sticks to that habit by sending a late third- and fourth-round pick to the Vikings so he can snag another big-play machine for an Eagles offense that disappointed in 2025. Tyson dealt with multiple injuries at the college level but could prove to be a steal here, thanks to his ability to win downfield.\n\nIn this mock the Eagles trade up to 18 with the Vikings. If something like this were to happen, this would be another “how are teams letting the Eagles do this” move. Tyson has a lot of love in the draft community. I don’t quite get the hype, but that’s just me.\n\nHe may not have as much love in the NFL community though, as his injury history is a big concern. He missed time in 2022 and 2023 from a torn ACL, MCL, and PCL. He missed time in 2024 with a broken collarbone. He missed time in 2025 with injuries to both hamstrings.\n\nThe Eagles have work to do along the offensive line this offseason, especially with the injury issues that 35-year-old right tackle Lane Johnson had in 2025. Iheanachor had a great week at the Senior Bowl that fortified his status as one of the highest-upside players in this class. He has terrific size at 6-foot-6 and 330 pounds, plus his nifty footwork allows him to hold up in pass protection.\n\nIheanachor will need time to develop, as he did not play high school football and must refine his technique. (He took nine penalties in 2025, too.) Philly would be an ideal landing spot since he can sit and learn behind a future Hall of Famer for at least a year.\n\nIheanachor is a risk, but that has never stopped the Eagles.\n\nIheanachor moved to America from Nigeria when he was 13 and as Yates says, he didn’t play football in high school, starting his career at East Los Angeles College, a JUCO, transferring after two seasons. He started all 14 Sun Devil games this year, and 5 last year. A team that can have him continuing to bake as a backup makes sense, he’s got a lot of room to grow. He moves pretty stiff, and he looks like he’s still figuring things out. I’d also like to see my big OT play with some nastinesses, which I didn’t see from him.\n\nThe need to develop is to be expected, he wasn’t playing football five years ago. But new OL coach Chris Kuper has no track record of development, and Lane Johnson has missed time in every season since 2015, so his primary backup is going to see the field.\n\nIf AJ Brown moves on this offseason, the Philadelphia Eagles could turn to Washington’s Denzel Boston to fill the X-receiver role. Boston blends size, skill, and scoring ability into a package tailor-made for the NFL, offering a proven knack for turning targets into explosive plays.\n\nBoston’s fluidity, tempo management, and zone IQ also give him polished route-running skills, making him a true X-receiver prospect with immediate impact potential. For the Eagles, he offers the kind of contested-catch ability and downfield production that can change the dynamic of the passing game from day one.\n\nWe can go ahead and skip the “if.” One reason is that this is a good draft for big WRs, replacing AJ Brown, at least in theory, will be an option in the draft. Along with Boston, Ohio State’s Carnell Tate–who won’t be on the board when the Eagles currently pick, Jordyn Tyson, Louisville’s Chris Bell, and Notre Dame’s Malachi Fields are options too.\n\nBoston does a really good job of using his size as a weapon, but he’s not just a contested catch merchant, his separation is good too. He might not run the fastest 40 but he can go get the ball down the field. I’m a fan.",

    "fullText": "Every offseason brings speculation, projection models, and plenty of debate — but nothing captures long-range anticipation quite like the way-too-early MVP odds. Before a single snap of the season is played, sportsbooks and analysts are already trying to forecast which superstar will dominate the narrative across the NFL landscape in 2026. These early numbers don’t just reflect talent — they reflect team trajectory, offensive stability, durability, and the ever-important storylines that shape voter perception.\n\nAt the front of the conversation are familiar faces who’ve already proven they can carry franchises and command national attention. Josh Allen remains a perennial contender because of his rare blend of physicality and high-volume production. Lamar Jackson continues to redefine quarterback play with explosive dual-threat impact that can reshape games week to week. Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes is almost permanently positioned in MVP discussions simply because excellence has become routine.\n\nJust behind them sit elite passers still chasing that defining MVP season. Justin Herbert possesses statistical upside that could translate into award recognition if team success follows. And Joe Burrow continues to build a résumé centered on precision, composure, and winning in high-leverage moments.\n\nOf course, “way too early” is the operative phrase. Injuries, breakout stars, coaching changes, and unexpected team surges will inevitably reshape the race. But right now, these odds offer a snapshot of who the football world expects to define the 2026 season — and whose performance could ultimately shape the league’s competitive hierarchy.\n\nOdds: +550\nAllen’s MVP case always starts with his physical dominance — few quarterbacks can stress defenses as both a power runner and vertical passer the way he does. If his efficiency stabilizes late in the season and turnover swings tighten up, he becomes incredibly hard to beat in voting. A top seed paired with highlight-reel production would make him the clear betting favorite.\n\nOdds: +650\nJackson’s ceiling is still unmatched when his rushing explosiveness and passing rhythm peak at the same time. Voters tend to reward his dual-threat dominance when his offense is built around his improvisational strengths. Another season where he controls tempo and stays healthy deep into January would put him squarely in the MVP spotlight again.\n\nOdds: +1000\nMahomes is almost permanently in the MVP conversation because of how consistently he elevates his offense regardless of surrounding personnel. If his statistical output rebounds into league-leading territory while maintaining elite situational play, the narrative momentum quickly returns. He’s the classic “never count him out” candidate when big moments pile up.\n\nOdds: +1000\nHerbert’s MVP path hinges on translating elite arm talent into sustained team success over a full season. When his deep passing and high-volume production align with efficient red-zone execution, his numbers look historic. A breakout year in the win column could finally convert his statistical brilliance into major award recognition.\n\nOdds: +1000\nBurrow’s candidacy thrives on precision, timing, and leadership in high-leverage moments. When his offense operates at peak efficiency and he controls games late, voters tend to gravitate toward his poised style. If he combines elite passing totals with another deep playoff push narrative, his MVP momentum can surge quickly.\n\nEarly MVP odds are less prediction and more temperature check — a reflection of reputation, momentum, and projected opportunity. They highlight who the league believes will matter most before the season even begins. And while the eventual winner often emerges from unexpected circumstances, these early favorites set the stage for the narratives, rivalries, and performances that will define the 2026 MVP race.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Way too early NFL MVP odds for 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

However, fans were impressed by Kelce’s witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood” in one of the creatives shared via an Instagram carousel.\n\nTravis Kelce referenced Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The New Heights podcast’s official Instagram account shared a carousel showcasing their wholesome Valentine’s Day greetings. The first slide in the carousel read, “Wood you be my Valentine?” accompanied by an animated tree and Kelce smiling.\n\nFor those who missed it, this is a reference to Swift’s raunchy track “Wood” from her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl. Notably, the global pop star has dedicated the song to her fiancé. The lyrics make a cheeky reference to Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, and his manhood as well. Swift sings, “New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood) / I ain’t gotta knock on wood” (via Page Six).\n\nFans are loving Kelce’s sweet tribute to Swift and lavished praise in the comments section. One fan commented, “Y’all had the opportunity to do the funniest thing and you did! Good job!!!” A second fan wrote, “These are too good,” accompanied by a laughing emoji. A third fan penned, “WOOD YOU BE MY VALENTINE HAHAHAHAHAH 13/13,” accompanied by clapping emojis. Finally, one fan remarked, “The wood one is my fav.”\n\nFans joked that Kelce is redeeming himself after previously not understanding a witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood.” During the Wednesday, January 21, episode of New Heights, Kelce joked that “Taylor’s gonna kill me” for missing a clear reference to Swift’s song “Wood.”\n\nThe post Travis Kelce’s Valentine’s Day Card Comes With Taylor Swift Twist appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "description": "NFL general managers will have to be creative in coming up with trades this offseason.",
    "fullText": "Player trades in the NFL have become more common in recent years, and one NFL insider believes the trend will continue this offseason.\n\nOn a recent episode of “The Adam Schefter Podcast,” the ESPN NFL reporter said it may be tougher for teams to get impact players this season through traditional means, meaning teams will likely be involved in more trades.\n\n“When we talk about the draft, and we’ll see how it shakes out over time, people aren’t all that excited about the draft,” Schefter said. “We got a free-agent class that’s not really deep. We’ve got a draft that is not considered really deep. You know what that tells me? More trades. That’s what it tells me. It tells me we may get more wheeling and dealing in trades than we’ve had in other years.”\n\nSchefter added that although he has not heard any specific trades that are brewing, he sees the activity around the Nov. 4 trade deadline as an indication of teams willing to make more deals to fix their rosters.\n\nThe trade market could be utilized by teams to acquire quarterbacks. This year’s quarterback draft class is not projected to be as strong as recent years, with Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza expected to go as the first overall pick and Alabama’s Ty Simpson appearing to be the only other quarterback projected as a first-round selection.\n\nKyler Murray (Arizona Cardinals) and Mac Jones (San Francisco 49ers) are expected to be the top targets on the trade market, with Raiders quarterback Geno Smith also expected to garner interest.\n\nOn the defensive side, Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby could be another player moved, although it has been previously reported that a deal for him could come after he finishes recovering from a knee injury he suffered late last season.",

    "title": "2026 NFL mock draft tracker: 40 mocks, 21 prospects for Dallas Cowboys",
    "description": "There are so many mock drafts.",
    "fullText": "At the end of January, we published our first mock draft database of the season. At the time, 21 of the 25 mocks (84%) were projecting the Cowboys to take a linebacker, with Sonny Styles (17 mocks, 68%) the clear favorite. The second most popular position was cornerback with 15 picks (60%), followed by edge rushers with 11 picks (44%). The early consensus seemed to be LB Sonny Styles with the 12th pick and a CB with the 20th pick, a combo offered by 10 of the 25 mocks or 40% of the time.\n\nBut a lot has happened since then: The Super Bowl came and went, this year’s salary cap was announced, the Senior Bowl is behind us, and the Cowboys look to have completed their coaching hires, so it’s again time to turn our attention to the very serious business of mock drafting.\n\nOn the hypothesis that the predictive value of multiple mock drafts is greater than that of a single mock, we are taking a survey of 40 different mock drafts today. Importantly, all 40 mocks were published on or after February 1st, giving us a big data set of the latest mock drafts. And here are all those 40 mocks, and which two players they have the Cowboys selecting.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nThat’s a ton of info to digest, with 21 different prospects mocked to the Cowboys somewhere in the first round, so let’s look at a few more digestible extracts from this exercise, starting with how this round of mocks compares to the last one.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nMock Draft distribution by Player Posiition\n\nWhat we see here is a shift away from linebackers to edge rushers, plus a strong increase in “other positions” that didn’t get much attention in January. Naturally, this produces some “winners and losers” among the players mocked to Dallas:\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nMock Draft distribution by Player Posiition\n\nSonny Styles still remains the consensus favorite for the Cowboys, but his lead over other prospects has dropped. At cornerback, the attention in the mock drafts shifted towards the top two guys in this draft class, Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy at the expense of the other corners in this class. At edge, the Cowboys are completely out of the Rueben Bain and David Bailey sweepstakes, but Cashius Howell and T.J. Parker are new names popping up in the mocks. Safety is getting some mock interest, but having Caleb Downs dropping all the way to No. 12 seems more like a pipe dream than anything else at the moment. But keep an eye on Emmanuel McNeill-Warren, he’s been getting increasing interest lately. Also, why anybody would have the Cowboys invest their No. 12 pick in a WR, RB, or DT is completely beyond me.\n\nBut all of that doesn’t yet tell us too much about how the first round could play out for the Cowboys. For that, I plotted where seven specific players were taken in each of the 50 mocks. Those seven players are:\n\nThe top safety, and maybe the best player in the draft, Caleb Downs\n\nThe consensus top pick from the 40 mocks, Sonny Styles\n\nThe top six edge rushers in the 40 mocks\n\nThe top four corners mocked to the Cowboys\n\nHere’s how often each player was taken at which spot in the 50 mocks:\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\n40 Mock Drafts – Summary Results\n\nThis table illustrates how the first round could likely play out for the Cowboys and the prospects they are interested in. One of the top two pass rushers, Bain or Bailey, is headed to Tennessee (#4) with the other one likely going to Washington (#7). Caleb Downs is a top 10 pick, and has a hard stop at Cincinnati (#10), though there is a slim chance he could fall to the Cowboys.\n\nLB Sonny Styles could be a consideration for Washington at #7, but they should happily bite on one of the falling pass rushers, so there’s a 70% (28 of 40 mocks) chance he’ll be available at #12 for the Cowboys. Barring Caleb Downs falling to them (12.5% chance), the Cowboys should have the option of picking between Styles (70%) or cornerbacks Mansoor Delane (37.5%) or Jermod McCoy (50%). Which of the two corners fall depends on what Miami does at #11.\n\nThe mocks seem to agree, for now, that pass rusher is the likely pick at #20 for the Cowboys, and depending on which player the Cowboys have their eyes on, they might even consider trading down from the 20th spot if they can find a team interested in moving up.\n\nOverall, that leaves the Cowboys with a lot of options, and if you boil it down to position combinations, here are the most frequent combinations among the 40 mocks:\n\nTo get a little more clarity on which player could be available for the Cowboys, you can look up the player ranking on your favorite big board, you can make up your own ranking, and you could even use a consensus big board to figure out such a ranking.\n\nOr we could look at the average draft position for each player based on the 40 mocks above, which is exactly what you’ll see in the table below. I included all LBs, CBs, edge rushers and safeties that were mocked to the Cowboys at least once, and added four more players to round things out (LB Arvell Reese, DE Rueben Bain, DE David Bailey, CB Avieon Terrell). To arrive at the average rank, I calculated the average across the 40 mocks, and where a player fell out of the Top 32, I used the 33th spot to calculate the average draft position.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nWithin the confines of this 40-mock data set, that gives the Cowboys plenty of options, with the big caveat that it’s still a long way to go to the draft.\n\nWhat would be your choice right now, based on these 40 mocks and the 21 prospects mocked to the Cowboys?",

However, then Illinois defensive backs coach Aaron Henry immediately saw something in him that others missed. “I really believe the Good Lord just creates people who are a little bit different, I saw that the first day I got to campus. There was no denying that. He played so hard. He was not ducking contact,” he told FoxSports.\n\nHenry knew Witherspoon wasn’t ready for Big Ten physicality and focused on reshaping Devon’s body and refine his game. Devon never said no to any challenges put forth to him.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks ended up drafting Devon with the 5th overall pick in the NFL Draft. Three Pro Bowls later,  he has been arguably the heartbeat of the turnaround of the franchise who are now Super Bowl Champions.\n\nAs the new defensive back’s coach settles into South Bend, Aaron Henry will be able to walk into the locker room with immediate credibility.

    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts had three different quarterbacks start games this past season. So, where did each of them land in NFL.com's starting quarterback rankings?\n\nNick Shook recently ranked all 63 quarterbacks who made a start last season. Based on their play in the regular season and playoffs, he then listed those quarterbacks from 1 to 63, placing them in tiers.\n\nMaking a big jump and landing in Tier 2 was Daniel Jones. For more on Jones' ranking and why Shook placed him there, you can find that here.\n\nBut what about Phillip Rivers and Riley Leonard?\n\nRivers came in at No. 36 and in Tier 5. A few others in this category included Kyler Murray, Joe Flacco, Spencer Rattler, and others.\n\n\"The 44-year-old proved he could still succeed with his brain; his arm, however, showed his age,\" Shook wrote.\n\nIn his three games, Rivers completed 63% of his passes for 544 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nThe Colts, unfortunately, did not win any of those games, but Rivers routinely put the offense into favorable looks pre-snap and helped that unit sustain drives and hang around in games, giving Indianapolis a chance.\n\nThe Colts needed stability at quarterback, and Rivers was able to provide that.\n\nLeonard, meanwhile, came in at No. 47 in these rankings and in Tier 6. Carson Wentz, Shedeur Sanders, Russell Wilson, and others were in this tier.\n\n\"Riley Leonard made one start and was shockingly effective, slinging the ball around the yard as if there was no tomorrow in a high-scoring loss to Houston,\" Shook wrote.\n\nAs Shook said, Leonard's start against Houston -- a very good defense -- in Week 18 was quite good. He completed 21-of-34 passes for 270 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.\n\nIt wasn't perfect by any means, but Leonard always found a way to respond. Could he be the Colts' backup quarterback in 2026?\n\nAnthony Richardson would appear in a couple of games before being placed on IR, but did not make any starts. So he did not qualify for Shook's rankings.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Every starting QB from 2025 ranked: Where do Colts QBs land?",

    "description": "Six quarterback prospects that the Packers could target in the 2026 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "In the last three drafts, Brian Gutekunst has selected two quarterbacks on Day 3. The Green Bay Packers general manager drafted Sean Clifford in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft and Michael Pratt in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nWith Jordan Love's backup, Malik Willis set to hit the open market and fetch a big payday, the Packers could be in the market to invest another Day 3 pick as they look to find a new backup for Love.\n\nLet's dive into some Day 3 quarterbacks who could be targets for the Packers during the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe winningest quarterback in college football history started his collegiate career at South Dakota State University, where he helped guide the Jackrabbits to two national championships. He has that \"it\" factor and he's not going to sink the ship. He'd keep Green Bay’s offense on track if he were forced into action. Much like Willis, the former SDSU quarterback can do damage with his legs. This past season at Iowa, he picked up 49 first downs with his legs. During his time in Brookings, he picked up 146 first downs on the ground and also had 60 runs of 10-plus yards.\n\nMark Gronowski is tough as nails. Tweaks his shoulder and still punches in the rushing touchdown to put Iowa up 24-16 at the half against Nebraska. pic.twitter.com/8f8Vn3tQJi\n\n— KCRG Sports (@KCRG_Sports) November 28, 2025\n\nPayton helped guide the Bison to a national championship during his first season as a starter. The southpaw quarterback threw for 2,719 yards and 16 touchdowns. Payton added 777 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. A former baseball player, Payton has the arm strength to rip throws into tight windows. He's able to navigate the rush and make accurate throws on the move. He has good acceleration when he gets outside the pocket and runs with the determination of a running back.\n\nNDSU QB Cole Payton is one of those draft, stash, & “develop” QB prospects you take mid draft. \n\nCrazy throw right here lol. Multiple reasons to buy in and see what you can mold him into. pic.twitter.com/RYnL21qVyW\n\n— Damian Parson💰 (@DP_NFL) February 6, 2026\n\nMrton has a quick setup and gets the ball out quickly. He sees the field well and understands where his outlets are. He's athletic in the pocket and comfortable making throws outside the pocket. He's got good zip on short and intermediate throws and shows good accuracy. Over the past two seasons, Morton threw for 5,900 yards and 47 touchdowns.\n\nBehren Morton is a productive and multi-faceted QB with elastic arm action, placing among nations leaders in categories of both efficiency and explosiveness@BehrenMorton also sits among the top of @TexasTechFB record books for career passing yds + total offense #WreckEm https://t.co/JHBsJ9lQ8t pic.twitter.com/cGLixeoPrd\n\n— Shane Coughlin (@Shane__Coughlin) January 10, 2026\n\nThe transfer from Boise State, Green passed for 5,868 yards and 34 touchdowns during his two seasons at Arkansas. Standing at 6-6 and 229 pounds, Green looks good off the bus and he has a rocket for an arm. Now it will be up to an NFL coaching staff to harness that natural arm strength and help him spray the ball accurately all over the field. Green can do damage with his legs, rushing for 1,379 yards and 16 touchdowns during his two seasons with the Razorbacks.\n\nA Texas native, Robertson started his collegiate career at Mississippi State before transferring to Baylor. This past season, Robertson threw for 3,681 yards and 31 touchdowns. He's a natural gunslinger with easy-looking arm talent. He has a quick reaction to get the ball out and on time.\n\nUSD's all-time leader in passing yards and completions is going to impress teams when he gets in front of them. He's a leader and an impressive individual off the field. At 6-5, 225 pounds, the USD quarterback is well built. He finished this past season with 2,876 yards and 26 touchdowns. The Minnesota native and Iowa State transfer has ties to Green Bay. Bouman's father, Todd Bouman, a long-time backup NFL quarterback, spent a minute with the Packers in 2006 as the team's backup quarterback after Aaron Rodgers got injured.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: 6 QB targets for Packers on Day 3 of 2026 NFL Draft",

    "description": "Could the Cowboys look to trade UP in the 2026 NFL Draft?",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NFL Draft quickly approaching, mock drafts and draft conversation are at their peak. For the Dallas Cowboys, who currently do not own a day two pick in the draft, many fans and analysts are looking at potential trade back scenarios from the 12th or 20th overall pick to pickup an additional second- or third-round pick on day two.\n\nBut Zach Wolchuk of 105.3 The Fan asked an interesting question on Twitter on Thursday that got the brain spinning. Could the Cowboys use their two first-round picks this year to move up in the draft, while also picking up a day two pick with their trade partner?\n\nIn Wolchuk’s scenario, he asked if people would be okay trading the 12th and 20th overall pick to the Cleveland Browns for the 6th and 39th overall pick? In most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent. But in this draft class that is substantially weaker than most, first round grades will likely max out at around 14. So realistically, the player the Cowboys would be drafting at 20 will more than likely have a second-round grade. If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nIn most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent.

If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nDallas trades the 12th and 20th (616 value points) overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft to Cleveland for the 6th and 39th (599 value points) overall pick. Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the sixth overall pick and edge rusher R Mason Thomas with the 39th overall pick.\n\nDallas trades the 12th, 20th, and 215th overall pick (617 value points) to the New Orleans for the 8th, 42nd, 73rd, and 189th (618 value points) overall pick. Using Pro Football Focus’ draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the eighth overall pick, cornerback Colton Hood with the 42nd overall pick, and linebacker Jacob Rodriguez with the 73rd overall pick.\n\nDallas offers the 12th, 20th, and 150th overall pick (629 value points) to Kansas City for the 9th and 74th overall pick and cornerback Trent McDuffie (619 value points). Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. with the ninth overall pick and safety Kamari Ramsey with the 74th overall pick.\n\nWith both the New York Giants and Washington Commanders picking inside the top 10 and unlikely to hand their divisional rival a blue chip talent, that leaves just a handful of spots that make sense for the Cowboys to consider. Given the value it would take to move into the top five, th Cowboys only have a few options to consider, but those couple options could give the Cowboys a chance at a player they would not be able to consider at 12, while also landing a quality player on day two and/or three.\n\nThere are only a few players likely to motivate the Cowboys to trade up in this draft. Ohio State safety Caleb Downs being one. Miami edge rusher Reuben Bain Jr. being one. But players like Texas Tech edge rusher David Bailey, LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane, and Ohio State linebacker Sonny Styles are also a few names to consider in this exercise.",

    "fullText": "Another NFL insider has connected the Indianapolis Colts to free agent defensive end Trey Hendrickson.\n\nThe NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe recently shared what he is hearing about Trey Hendrickson and the Cincinnati Bengals, and mentioned as a team to watch were the Colts.\n\n\"From what I understand, a team source told me, he figures it's unlikely for these two sides (Hendrickson and the Bengals) to reunite going into next season,\" Wolfe said. \"And so what does that mean? Do the Bengals let him go in free agency? Do they try to slap the franchise tag on him and trade him? A difficult decision for Cincy because their relationship has not been great in recent weeks.\n\nWolfe continued, \"And I'm told that if this deal does end up happening, free agency-wise, keep an eye on the Indianapolis Colts. It's a team that wants to be aggressive; they made the big splash move for Sauce Gardner mid-season. Lou Anarumo has a lot of familiarity with Trey Hendrickson. They just hired a D-line coach named Marion Hobby, who coached Trey Hendrickson for four years in Cincinnati.\n\n\"When they were all together, Lou, Marion, and Trey Hendrickson, they had 57 sacks in four seasons. Four Pro Bowl seasons. They're going to be aggressive in trying to get him if he does reach the market, or even if it's a sign and trade. It could be a big splash move for the Indianapolis Colts.\"\n\nTHE WOLFE OF BALL STREET: EARLY OFF-SEASON PREVIEW\n\n- Why Travis Hunter offense vs. defense usage will change a lot in 2026\n- Keep an eye on Trey Hendrickson and Indianapolis Colts\n- Browns could go with Shedeur Sanders and/or Deshaun Watson at QB, pass on drafting QB high again pic.twitter.com/1pQ60wmKm3\n\n— Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) February 14, 2026\n\nAs Wolfe alluded to with all the connections he made between the Colts and Hendrickson, Indianapolis' interest doesn't come as much of a surprise.\n\nFor one, more pass-rush help is needed. The Colts need to bolster their defensive end depth this offseason and need more pass-rush juice from that position group.\n\nIn addition to that, he will be very familiar with Lou Anarumo's defensive scheme after spending several seasons playing for him while the two were with the Bengals. Hendrickson's most productive seasons came with Anarumo as his defensive coordinator.\n\nAnd of note, the Colts have reportedly expressed interest in Hendrickson previously. Last offseason, when the Bengals were potentially trading Hendrickson, the Colts reportedly called Cincinnati to check in.\n\nAfter GM Chris Ballard was more aggressive in free agency last offseason, it sounds like the Colts plan to take a similar approach this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts free agency: Indianapolis again connected to Trey Hendrickson",

    "description": "George Pickens' future is up in the air at the time of writing, and that lends itself to all sorts of scenarios that could potentially play out.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys and George Pickens are getting set for a big offseason of contract talks, and you can bet it won't be smooth sailing.\n\nWith the Cowboys set to franchise Pickens, just as our own Mike Fisher reported back on November 27, that has led some to think the franchise could look to trade the Pro Bowl receiver and get something in return.\n\nIn truth, trading Pickens doesn't seem like a move that winning football teams make, and one could only imagine the backlash if the Cowboys trade Micah Parsons and then Pickens in back-to-back offseasons.\n\nAt the time of writing, we don't get the sense that Dallas wants to trade George, with Fish stating that some sections of people inside The Star would have an aneurysm if that were to happen.\n\nSo that tells you what the franchise thinks of Pickens.\n\nIt is here where NFL Network's Ian Rapoport offers his thoughts on what might entice Dallas to trade Pickens.\n\n“They’re going to franchise tag him, I just wonder what happens next,” Rapoport said. “He had a breakout year. These are the guys you don't let walk in free agency, and he's been great. What I really don't know is, are the Cowboys going to get an offer for Pickens that would allow them to trade him?\n\"They acquired him for a three, what if they franchise-tagged [Pickens], he gets the long-term deal that he wants, and they [Cowboys] get a two back? That's incredible value. I wonder if that's something that would be palatable for the Cowboys.\"\n\nIf I were Dallas' general manager, a second-round pick would not be enough for me to move on from Pickens. In truth, given what we saw George do, not only for the offense as a whole, but for individual players, I'm not sure I'm letting him go at all. Barring a godfather-like offer, of course.\n\nInstead, use the cap space and draft picks to rebuild the defense, while keeping the offense together.\n\nThis isn't the first time we have heard Dallas trading Pickens and getting a second-round pick back, and one thing we know about Rapoport is that he doesn't say things for the sake of it.\n\nSo there might be some merit to his line of thinking. He got that from somewhere.\n\nHow Jerry Jones approaches Pickens' contract will tell us a lot about where the owner's mind is regarding building a roster capable of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nThe offense with Pickens is more than capable of winning it all. It just needs a defense that can complement it.\n\nIf you trade away Pickens, you lose a huge part of what makes your offense great.\n\nAnd in the process, might throw away a chance at finally making that NFC Championship game.",

The 42-year-old entered 2025 on a one-year deal with the intention of it being his final season. However, he kept the door open to return in 2026, and now the Steelers await his decision.\n\nIn terms of his performance in 2025, Rodgers threw 24 touchdowns to just seven interceptions and led the Steelers to an AFC North championship. It’s because of that year-long outing that Nick Shook of NFL Media ranked Rodgers as the No. 16 quarterback amongst all 63 to start a game in 2025.\n\n“Aaron Rodgers bested Father Time for much of 2025 and is the primary reason the Steelers even reached the playoffs,” Shook writes. “He produced some of his best games of the last three or four years and can definitely still fill a starting job somewhere in this league if he wants it.”\n\nRodgers was sandwiched between Brock Purdy (No. 15) and Baker Mayfield (No. 17).\n\nShould Rodgers return, he would reunite with his former head coach in Green Bay, Mike McCarthy.\n\nLet us know what you think in the comments. Be sure to bookmark Behind the Steel Curtain for all the latest news, breakdowns, and more!\n\nMason Rudolph sides with Joey Porter on Big Ben comments\n\nAntonio Brown defends Ben Roethlisberger after Joey Porter comments\n\nCam Heyward ends retirement speculation\n\nJoey Porter calls out Ben Roethlisberger for being a bad teammate",

    "description": "Part 3 of @wiltfongjr’s Bears roster turnover series focuses on the tight ends. Does Chicago have the best duo in the league?",
    "fullText": "Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson changed his offensive scheme from what he used in Detroit to better utilize his roster, but a few principles remained. He wants to run the ball, use play action, and get his tight ends involved. He also expects his tight ends to be versatile so that he can line them up anywhere on the field.\n\nIn 2025, the Bears used the sixth-highest percentage of 12 personnel (1 running back, 2 tight ends) in the NFL and the fifth-highest percentage of 13 personnel.\n\nJohnson’s offense will continue to evolve schematically, but I can’t see Ben deviating too far from his use of tight ends, which makes this an important position that needs quality depth.\n\nHere’s how the Bears’ tight end room currently shapes up.\n\nColston Loveland – Signed through 2028* – Loveland was one of the most dynamic rookies in the NFL, and this was after a slow start to the season. He flashed elite traits and appears primed to push for the Pro Bowl next season. His athleticism makes him a perfect “move” tight end, but he didn’t seem to mind lining up as the Y and blocking either. It’s easy to see why the Bears valued his skill set at 10 overall in the draft, and why his ceiling is even higher than that of a perennial Pro Bowler.\n\n*Bears have the fifth-year option for 2029.\n\nCole Kmet – Signed through 2027 – The Bears could save about $8 million if they move on from Kmet, but I think it’s more likely they rework his deal and sign him to an extension. Kmet has become a reliable in-line blocker, but he’s athletic enough to line up wide or in the backfield. He’ll likely never approach the 73 receptions he had in 2023, but he plays an important role in Johnson’s offense.\n\nLoveland and Kmet make up one of the best tight end duos in the NFL.\n\nDurham Smythe – Free agent – The 30-year-old veteran played in a quarter of the Bears’ offensive snaps (293) and the sixth-most snaps on special teams (230). I can see the Bears bringing him back on another one-year deal.\n\nThe next three players spent time on Chicago’s practice squad in 2025 and signed reserve/futures contracts.\n\nStephen Carlson – Signed through 2026 – Carlson has been with the Bears since 2023, but he’s only appeared in three games. He’s a solid veteran option to call up from the practice squad, but at 29 years old, he’s probably never going to crack a 53-man roster.\n\nNikola Kalinic – Signed through 2026 – The 29-year-old began his career in the CFL in 2019, and the Bears are his fourth NFL team since 2022. He played in two games for the Bears in 2025, making 3 special teams tackles.\n\nQadir Ismail – Signed through 2026 – The Bears are his fifth NFL team since being a Ravens UDFA in 2024. At 6’6”, 232 pounds, he’s a good athlete who started his collegiate career as a quarterback for Villanova and finished it as a wide receiver for Samford. His dad, Qadry, was a ten-year veteran in the NFL.\n\n2026 OUTLOOK – Assuming Kmet stays, the Bears won’t be addressing this position with big money in free agency or a high draft pick. However, some bottom of the depth chart competition should come from a UDFA or two.\n\nWhat do you think will happen at tight end this offseason?",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The sports media is ignoring the story, but wealthy sports figures are all over the Epstein files.\n\nChild sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein did not want to ingratiate himself only to billionaires. He wanted to spend time with people who shaped the culture, and as we saw during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show, nothing shapes the culture quite like the athletic industrial complex.\n\nThe website Front Office Sports went through the latest tranche of hurriedly redacted Epstein files, and it is shocking just how many NFL franchise owners are in these e-mails and assorted documents. They include—and this is a partial list—Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots; Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants and first cousin of Jessica Tisch, the current New York City police commissioner; Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins; Zygi Wilf, owner of the Minnesota Vikings; and Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons. There are more NFL owners in the Epstein files than attended the Super Bowl.\n\nDenials have already been sputtered, and the owners’ public relations machines are working in overdrive to deny that they are anything more than incidental acquaintances of Epstein. But how many were actually friends with Epstein is less relevant than the fact that everyone who associated with Epstein ignored and excused what was often happening in plain sight around them. And as hard as their PR mavens are working to deflect attention, the sports media is working just as hard to ignore it all.\n\nAfter all, who could possibly imagine that Kraft would be involved in anything illicit when it comes to exercising power over young women? ESPN has essentially not covered the sports figures involved with Epstein. There are scant few articles under the byline “ESPN News Services,” which draws from the Associated Press. There has been no investigative journalism or televised commentary on one of their yak-fests. When one considers that the NFL now owns a portion of ESPN, not to mention that the NFL is central to much of its programming, the network’s blasé attitude toward the story is odious.\n\nEven more damning in the released files is the repeated presence of LA 2028 Olympic chairman Casey Wasserman. He says he did nothing wrong, though two Los Angeles supervisors and two members of the City Council have now called for him to resign from his role with the Olympic organizing committee. LA City Council member Monica Rodriguez said that Wasserman represents “a threat to the integrity of the games.”\n\nWassermans’s clients are already leaving his talent agency in protest. Olympian Abby Wambach and popstar Chappell Roan have dropped Wasserman and are calling for him to step down from the agency that bears his name.\n\nOf course, by any moral marker, Wasserman should not be allowed within 500 yards of the Olympics (or a school). His e-mails to Epstein’s partner in child trafficking, Ghislaine Maxwell, date back 20 years and include unredacted tidbits like, “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” LA Mayor Karen Bass, however, has not joined the call for him to disappear from the 2028 Games, already being called “The Epstein Olympics.”\n\nThe unconvincing excuses for keeping Wasserman at his post include the difficulty of replacing the chair of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee at this late of a date, as well as his ability to raise corporate cash. After what the organizing committee described as an “internal investigation,” Wasserman, whose grandfather Lew Wasserman was one of Hollywood’s most powerful people, is staying on as chair. We need to fight to see every page of the Epstein files with only the names of the survivors and victims redacted—but that is not enough. To paraphrase journalist Nolan Higdon, it is becoming more and more difficult to “shield the architects of the second Gilded Age”—and they deserve no such protections.\n\nThe Epstein files have exposed that global elites have never been wealthier and more influential, but they’ve become drunk on power after decades of plunder. This second Gilded Age isn’t ending until the exposure is total and its criminal offenders are frog-marched out of the owners’ boxes.",

    "fullText": "On Thursday night, President Donald Trump announced that five former National Football League players with criminal records will receive pardons, including one late former Houston Oilers player.\n\nBefore he was drafted into the NFL, Billy Cannon was a standout tight end at Louisiana State University, where he won the coveted Heisman Trophy in 1959.\n\nCannon joined the Bud Adams-owned Houston Oilers under new head coach Lou Rymkus, the same calendar year he won the Heisman, shortly after a contract dispute with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe All-Pro set a record in first season for all-purpose yards and helped the Oilers to an AFL Championship.\n\nHis later seasons with the team were marred by injuries and back problems, and he successfully requested a release from the team in 1964 before signing with the Oakland Raiders, then ending his NFL career with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nCannon continued on and eventually became a dentist after his career. According to a report from ESPN, Cannon later admitted to counterfeiting in the 1980s after a series of bad investments and debts left him penniless.\n\nHe served two years in a Texarkana prison. He later died in 2018 in Louisiana.\n\nOther players pardoned included Joe Klecko, Jamal Lewis, Travis Henry, and Nate Newton of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story you think we should cover?

    "description": "Two NFL draft analysts have some good news for the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "Two of the best NFL draft analysts in the business, Daniel Jeremiah and Jordan Reid, have some good news for the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nAddressing cornerback and edge rusher are likely two items fairly high up on GM James Gladstone's offseason to-do list, and this year's draft class has a lot of talent at those positions.\n\nOn the edge rusher position, Jeremiah had this to say: \"If you need an edge rusher, this is a good draft to double up. The depth of the class is impressive. I've got 10 guys worthy of a spot in top 50 players. There's another layer of traitsy players beyond that group.\"\n\nThe Jaguars are positioned well here with Josh Hines-Allen and Travon Walker, but depth is a need. Beyond those two, the only other defensive ends under contract as of now are Danny Striggow and BJ Green.\n\nJacksonville could also use more steady pass-rush production from the rotational members of their defensive front.\n\nHere are the top 10 defensive ends in this year's draft from Mel Kiper's big board:\n\n1. Rueben Bain Jr., Miami (Fla.)2. Keldric Faulk, Auburn3. Zion Young, Missouri4. Akheem Mesidor, Miami (Fla.)5. Dani Dennis-Sutton, Penn State6. Caden Curry, Ohio State7. LT Overton, Alabama8. Jack Pyburn, LSU9. Max Llewellyn, Iowa10. Vincent Anthony Jr., Duke\n\nReid then had this to say about the cornerback and safety positions: \"This is a fantastic DB class. I have a huge cluster of 2nd and 3rd round grades at both safety and CB right now. The testing and on-field drills will be fun to watch at the Combine. Interested to see who separates from the group.\"\n\nAt cornerback, the Jaguars still have Jourdan Lewis, Jarrian Jones, and Travis Hunter, but Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome are free agents.\n\nThe level of need that Jacksonville has at this position will be dependent on what happens in free agency with Brown and Newsome, or whether an outside addition is made.\n\nSafety is less of a need, but perhaps is still a position that Gladstone could add to. Andrew Wingard is set to be a free agent, but on the roster are Eric Murray, Antonio Johnson, Caleb Ransaw, and Rayuan Lane.\n\nHere are Kiper's top cornerbacks in this year's draft:\n\n1. Jermod McCoy, Tennessee2. Mansoor Delane, LSU3. Avieon Terrell, Clemson4. Brandon Cisse, South Carolina5. Colton Hood, Tennessee6. D'Angelo Ponds, Indiana7. Chris Johnson, San Diego State8. Julian Neal, Arkansas9. Chandler Rivers, Duke10. Keionte Scott, Miami (Fla.)\n\nThe Jaguars do not have a first-round pick this year, but Jacksonville owns 11 picks in total, including four in the top 100. So the opportunity to address both edge rusher and cornerback with early-round picks does exist.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Lots of talent for Jaguars at 2 key positions of need",

He will join a large ownership group that includes former NFL running back Marshawn Lynch, Golden State Warriors guard Gary Payton II, Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd and musician Billie Joe Armstrong, lead singer of Green Day, which performed before Super Bowl 60 last Sunday.\n\n“Bringing my business acumen and sports fandom together as part of the Oakland Roots and Soul ownership group is truly special,” E-40 said in a statement. “This move is about investing in a sport that connects the world. I look forward to working closely with the ownership team to continue to amplify the fan experience while delivering successful results on the field.”\n\nE-40 will perform at the Oakland Roots season opener against New Mexico United on March 14 in the USL Championship. The Soul plays in the USL W League.\n\nHe’s often seen at sporting events in the Bay Area. E-40 has been spotted courtside at Golden State Warriors games, and he is a vocal San Francisco 49ers supporter. He created the song “Niner Gang,” which derives from the popular saying for their fans, “Bang, bang, Niner Gang.” When the San Francisco Giants were making World Series runs in the early 2010s, E-40 attended home games and traveled to road games to support. He was also the featured performer when the Cal Golden Bears football team held “Bay Appreciation Day” in 2024.\n\nE-40, a Vallejo, Calif., native, was honored by the city in October 2023. The city had a one-mile stretch of Magazine Street renamed “E-40 Way.”\n\nWith the Warriors back in San Francisco, the Raiders now in Las Vegas and the Oakland A’s now playing in West Sacramento, the soccer clubs have emerged as a source of pride and new alternatives for pro sports in Oakland. They’ve also been a leader in celebrating town culture and community.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSan Francisco Giants, Soccer, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

However, a trading party takes on $34M this season in salary–unless Arizona takes on some of that salary.\n\nThen there is also the idea of compensation. That $34M figure will likely influence trade compensation. If the Cardinals were to eat some of that money, it could reasonably be expected that they would get a better return in a trade.\n\nMORE: George Kittle sends message to 49ers, NFL over wild conspiracy theory\n\nThe Cardinals want to get this done quickly, as Murray’s base salary becomes guaranteed four days after the 2026 new league year date. They could potentially post-June 1 release him, but that would leave no return.\n\nMurray has been linked to multiple teams, including the Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, and even the Cleveland Browns. The Colts are uncertain of Daniel Jones’ recovery timeline, the Jets will likely move on from Fields, and the Browns are always looking for a quarterback.\n\nOne thing feels almost certain: Murray will be in a different uniform only a few years after signing a hefty contract extension.

Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen shared the RB2 role, while Jack Kiser and Rayuan Lane were core special teams contributors.\n\nJonah Monheim stepped in at center on a few occasions when needed.\n\nUndrafted rookies BJ Green and Danny Striggow also made the 53-man roster and went from only helping on special teams to filling rotational roles on defense.\n\nIn terms of Year 1 from this rookie class, the Jaguars didn't get a ton of high-end contributions. However, Jacksonville's ability to get steady contributions from Day 3 picks and UDFAs is a good sign for the future, Gladstone said, and the strong processes that Jacksonville has in place.\n\n\"At this point, there's plenty of room for optimism,\" Gladstone said of the draft class.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: Jaguars 2025 draft class receives lackluster grade from analyst",

We know how the NFL works, though. This is and 365 day a 365-day-a-year enterprise, and the grind never stops.\n\nAs the Seahawks look towards the 2026 season, and let’s be honest, that’s already happening, one of the biggest questions is the future of Cooper Kupp.\n\nMORE: NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break\n\nFrom a regular-season perspective, Kupp’s first season in Seattle wasn’t great. He finished with just 47 catches for 593 yards and two touchdowns. Kupp wasn’t close to being the same dominating player that he was in his prime with the Los Angeles Rams. While part of that was due to the sheer dominance and overwhelming success of Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the Seattle running game, it was hard not to take note of that.\n\nWith Smith-Njigba dealing with a concussion in the Super Bowl, Kupp stepped up and caught six of 12 targets for 61 yards. It closed out a strong postseason in which he caught 15 passes for 157 yards and a touchdown in three games.\n\nBut with the veteran entering his age-33 season, Seattle has a tough decision to make on Kupp.\n\nHe has a $17.47 million cap hit next season and that comes with $8 million of dead money. While the Seahawks are currently fifth in available cap space at $73 million, releasing Kupp would create a substantial windfall. Seattle is fortunate that Sam Darnold is on an affordable contract for a quarterback, but Kenneth Walker is a free agent, and they can’t ignore the status of their defense.\n\nRashid Shaheed is also a free agent, which means that the Seahawks are thin at the receiver position. But is Kupp the best use of their capital and roster space? He showed this season that he’s not capable of being a true number two receiver, and he’s overpaid to be a third or fourth option. If Kupp is still in Seattle in 2026, it will likely be because his contract was re-done.\n\nOLYMPICS: Norway skier goes viral after displaying insane Winter Olympics speed\n\nSUPER BOWL: Ranking the last 10 NFL Super Bowl champions\n\nMLB: Texas Rangers’ Nolan Ryan jersey giveaway is a bloody mess\n\nMEDIA: Photos of potential suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance released by FBI\n\nVIRAL: Norwegian Olympics star makes stunning girlfriend admission after winning bronze medal\n\nThe post Seahawks have a tough decision to make on star player after Super Bowl win appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "If you build it, they will come?\n\nSome Iowa state senators introduced a bill this week that would expand the state's major economic growth attraction program, creating financial incentives that could lure an NFL team seeking to build a stadium in the Hawkeye State.\n\nTheir target? The Chicago Bears.\n\n\"After years of Bears fans seeking refuge across the Mississippi River from the incompetence, corruption and punitive tax and regulatory climate in the state of Illinois, it is time for the team to join their fans on the west side of the river,\" Republican Scott Webster, one of the legislation's sponsors said in a statement.\n\n\"Iowa can offer the Bears everything they need to build a world-class facility, tax certainty and the public infrastructure they need in a state led by common-sense conservatives.\"\n\nThe recruitment pitch didn't end there.\n\n\"While Illinois and Indiana squabble over this issue, we are ready to get off the sidelines and into the game,\" Kerry Gruenhagen, another senator sponsoring the bill, said in a statement. \"Bringing an NFL team to Iowa would attract jobs, tourism and fans to our state and give us the opportunity to showcase what Iowa really has to offer. Iowans have dedicated themselves to our college sports teams, and we're ready to attract a professional team to our great state.\"\n\nWhile Iowa was the stage for \"Field of Dreams,\" it isn't home to any major professional sports franchises.\n\nOne of the NFL's original franchises, born in 1920 as the Decatur Staleys, the Bears have been seeking a new stadium for years. Tenants of historic Soldier Field, the league's smallest venue in terms of capacity (61,500) in downtown Chicago since 1971, the Bears had planned to move to suburban Arlington Heights, where they own a 326-acre tract of land that used to be the site of Arlington International Racecourse.\n\nBut team president Kevin Warren wrote in a letter to season ticket-holders in December that an inability to get assistance from the state of Illinois in offsetting infrastructure costs around the proposed project had led the team to consider alternatives. The team has committed to paying for construction of a new stadium itself.\n\n\"We have not asked for state taxpayer dollars to build the stadium at Arlington Park. We asked only for a commitment to essential local infrastructure (roads, utilities, and site improvements) which is more than typical for projects of this size,\" Warren wrote. \"Additionally, we sought reasonable property tax certainty to secure financing. We listened to state leadership and relied on their direction and guidance, yet our efforts have been met with no legislative partnership.\n\n\"We have been told directly by State leadership, our project will not be a priority in 2026.\"\n\nWarren specifically cited Northwest Indiana as a potential locale to build a new stadium.\n\nHowever, Illinois officials continue working to find a solution that would keep the Bears, a beloved team and one on the rise after winning the NFC North for the first time since 2018, in the Chicagoland area, where they've played since 1921.\n\n\"There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,\" Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday.\n\n\"But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the Legislature.\"\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Chicago Bears to Iowa?

    "fullText": "Top snubs from the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs we close the book on the 2025 season, the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine will give us our first taste of football for the offseason. The football world will descend upon Indianapolis for a week of interviews, drills, and athletic testing destined to shape the late-winter discourse.\n\nOver 300 prospects will be invited to the event, hoping to boost their draft stocks ahead of the pro day circuit. Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss won't be among them.\n\nFear not, Chambliss was not left off the list for character concerns or bureaucratic oversight. Rather, it's an indictment of the NFL's expectations for his pending hearing, which is challenging the NCAA's decision to deny his waiver for eligibility. It seems like Chambliss is headed back to school, allowing us to focus on the prospects who were snubbed from the Scouting Combine.\n\nBlack, after six college seasons, will play the majority of his rookie season at 25 years old. That developmental path (and his age-adjusted production) isn't kind to his draft stock, and it may be the biggest reason he isn't headed to Indianapolis.\n\nHowever, Black put himself on NFL radars in 2025, playing a significant role on a championship-winning offense. Black ran for 1,040 yards and 10 scores this past season. He boasts NFL-level athleticism with the speed to hit home runs, experience with zone and gap runs, and enough size to check the box.\n\nIn a world where Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Georgia Tech's Haynes King are getting Combine invites, it becomes difficult to gather why Kaliakmanis won't be among the participants in Indianapolis.\n\nKaliakmanis was incredibly productive for Rutgers, ranking eighth in EPA and seventh in EPA/DB -- between Pavia and King -- in 2025. He's not a lock to get drafted, but Kaliakmanis looks the part of a mid-Day 3 pick and a prototypical backup quarterback at the next level. With a big arm and multiple seasons of starting experience, it's surprising that he hasn't gotten more love.\n\nTyren Montgomery, WR, John Carroll\n\nPerhaps the most notable admission from the Combine festivities is John Carroll's Tyren Montgomery. His wild ride to Mobile culminated in a strong Senior Bowl performance, proving that a Division III standout could play with the best upperclassmen the Division I could offer.\n\nAn excellent athlete at 6'1\", 190 pounds, Carroll seems like a prospect the NFL would want to see get as many reps as possible during the pre-draft process. Given that nearly 50 receivers were invited to the event, Montgomery should have received an invitation.\n\nFoster stood out on my preseason board as a potential low-end starter headlining the Kansas offensive line. All he's done in the time since is continue to win in pass protection.\n\nFoster has SEC pedigree after three seasons in the middle of Texas A&M's line, then he took a step forward against Big 12 competition. With adequate measurables and a track record of success, his median projection still looks like a solid backup center.\n\nTerion Stewart, RB, Virginia Tech\n\nStewart won't be in Indianapolis because of his production. Just 469 yards in his first year of Power 4 play isn't all that impressive, and nine career receptions is laughably little work through the air.\n\nMORE: Meet the three contenders for RB2 in the 2026 NFL Draft\n\nHowever, Stewart has intriguing fundamentals, fun burst, and elite contact balance, perhaps making him a role player at the next level. It will be an uphill climb to raise his stock during the pre-draft process, but his film made a worthy case for Indianapolis. I expect him to be a priority free agent in April, much like Raheim Sanders.\n\nHaynes shares a lot of similarities with Wake Forest's Demond Claiborne, who rightfully rose up boards in a bad running back class. The Georgia Tech back is undersized and limited to a rotational role at the next level. Still, Haynes has the athleticism, footwork, and instincts to make plays on Sundays.\n\nHaynes is a former receiver who stands out as a natural pass-catcher out of the backfield. As an integral piece of Georgia Tech's run-heavy attack, an inefficient season shouldn't have cost him the chance to show out at the Scouting Combine.\n\nFive prospects who make sense for Klint Kubiak's Las Vegas Raiders\n\nFive winners from the 2026 Senior Bowl\n\nSeattle Seahawks Super Bowl mock draft\n\nPatriots mock draft: How New England can get Drake Maye the help he needs",

    "fullText": "Maxx Crosby’s future remains up in the air as we speak. The star defensive end didn’t end the 2025 NFL season on the best of terms with the Las Vegas Raiders. The AFC West team shut him down for the final two weeks of the regular season, which caused issues in their relationships.\n\nAs the days go by, it seems that Crosby is closer to the exit door. He has been mentioned as a potential trade target for Super Bowl contenders, including the defending champions Seattle Seahawks, as well as other strong teams such as the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s edition of ESPN’s “Get Up,” former NFL player Jason McCourty floated the idea of the Raiders shipping Crosby to Texas and landing one of the best wide receivers in the league.\n\n“If I’m the Raiders, why not go out and trade Maxx Crosby to the Dallas Cowboys?” He questioned. “You franchise tag George Pickens, you don’t work on a long-term deal. You trade him to the Raiders, get Crosby in exchange.\n\n“Now you just beefed up your defensive line. New coordinator coming over. Maxx Crosby is going to make everybody on the defensive side of the ball better, and of top of that, have you watched the way Maxx Crosby plays the game of football? He plays every single play of the game.”\n\nMaxx Crosby for George Pickens?\n\n@JasonMcCourty lays out a potential Cowboys-Raiders deal pic.twitter.com/Ng0umUEQLj\n\n— Get Up (@GetUpESPN) February 11, 2026\n\nMcCourty added that landing George Pickens would put Fernando Mendoza in a position to succeed with the Raiders. The future No. 1 overall pick won’t have much to work with if he joined the Raiders today, and Pickens is coming off his best season to date.\n\nAccording to Jason LaCanfora of Sports Boom, Maxx Crosby made a final decision on his future with the Raiders. The defensive end reportedly informed minority owner Tom Brady that he won’t suit up for the team again.\n\n“He told (Raiders owner and future Hall of Fame quarterback) Tom Brady he will never play for the Raiders again,” LaCanfora wrote.\n\nHe noted that the same happened with Myles Garrett last season, and he agreed to return to the Cleveland Browns. It remains to be seen if Crosby has a similar path this offseason.\n\nOLYMPICS: Norway skier goes viral after displaying insane Winter Olympics speed\n\nSUPER BOWL: Ranking the last 10 NFL Super Bowl champions\n\nMLB: Texas Rangers’ Nolan Ryan jersey giveaway is a bloody mess\n\nMEDIA: Photos of potential suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance released by FBI\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break\n\nVIRAL: Norwegian Olympics star makes stunning girlfriend admission after winning bronze medal\n\nThe post ESPN analyst proposes Cowboys trade star WR for Maxx Crosby appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "A recent report confirms what has been reported for weeks. The Bears will not receive comp picks for Ian Cunningham leaving to be Atlanta’s GM.",
    "fullText": "According to Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, who emailed the NFL for confirmation, the Chicago Bears will not receive compensatory draft picks for losing assistant general manager Ian Cunningham to the Atlanta Falcons, where he will serve as their general manager.\n\n“The policy for receiving picks pertains to the head coach or the primary football executive,” the NFL told PFT on Tuesday via email. “The primary football executive position was filled by Matt Ryan.”\n\nThis was the expectation all along, since Matt Ryan was hired to be the Falcons’ president of football, a position Cunningham also interviewed for. Had Cunningham been hired for that job, which is Atlanta’s primary football executive, then the Bears would have been awarded two third-round draft picks by virtue of the Rooney Rule.\n\nWhat brought this subject up again was Ryan’s recent declaration that Cunningham will take the lead on roster decisions.\n\nAfter being asked if he would be actively involved in the draft and free agency, Ryan said, “Ian is in charge of that space.” Ryan went on to say that he’s looking forward to learning about the draft process because he’s never even sat in a draft meeting, and that he “has a lot to learn.“\n\nHe reiterated that Cunningham is “driving this boat, and he’s the one that’s leading us moving forward,” but Ryan will be involved and helping out in any way he can. “This is Ian’s regular season right now; he is in it, and he is driving the ship for us.”\n\nEvery team has a primary and a secondary football executive position on file with the league, and no matter what that’s called from team to team, or what the responsibilities for each of those are, there’s no getting around the 1-2 front office hierarchy that each franchise has set up.",

    "fullText": "While Indiana officials play up their efforts to lure the Chicago Bears across the border for a new stadium, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday that he and his staff have made “progress” to incentivize the football team to stay in Illinois.\n\nThe governor’s comments come as Pritzker’s January calendar shows he had two scheduled conversations with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell while Goodell was in Chicago for the Bears-Packers playoff game on Jan. 10.\n\nDuring his time here for the game, Goodell joined Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren and Chair George McCaskey on a tour of the Arlington Heights site the team owns, and sites in northwest Indiana, including one near Wolf Lake in Hammond.\n\nThe first conversation between the governor and Goodell was a scheduled half-hour phone call on Jan. 9, while the second was a half-hour discussion between the two on Jan. 12, according to the governor’s calendar entries. The governor’s office on Monday declined to comment on how the conversations went or what was said.\n\nBut the scheduled talks underscore that efforts surrounding the Bears stadium have not gone dormant, even though the team said in December it was exploring a move to northwest Indiana after negotiations with Pritzker and his Democratic allies in the Illinois General Assembly hit a lull.\n\nThe key sticking points in Illinois have been over how the state would legislatively or financially aid the team in its desire to build a stadium in Chicago’s northwest suburbs. In particular, topics have evolved around assistance for infrastructure around a proposed Arlington Heights stadium, property tax certainty for the team and payment of debt for the Soldier Field renovations done more than 20 years ago at the team’s behest.\n\nSources familiar with the discussions between the Bears and state of Illinois officials said both sides have been meeting regularly since early December to hammer out legislation for this spring’s legislative session in Springfield. The talks have been in line with public infrastructure improvements for or around the Bears stadium site in Arlington Heights and so-called megaprojects legislation that would make it easier for the Bears to negotiate with local governments over property taxes, sources said. In addition, the governor’s office has sought for the Bears to implement measures to make games more affordable, the sources said.\n\nSince the Bears’ December announcement that opened the door to a stadium across the border, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun has said his administration was “working hard” to attract the Bears and has pushed a bill to establish a state authority to “acquire, construct, equip, own, lease, and finance” a sports stadium.\n\nBut on Monday, Pritzker, during an unrelated news conference in southwest Illinois, cast an optimistic tone when he described Illinois officials’ relationship with the Bears these days.\n\n“There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,” he said in Belleville, where he and other lawmakers talked about a bond program meant to spur economic development in Illinois communities. “But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the legislature.”\n\nThe Tribune reported that in late December, Pritzker’s office signed a new $25,000 contract with an outside attorney to continue advising the administration in negotiations with the Bears through the end of June.\n\nPritzker on Monday also reiterated his position on the Bears’ quest for state incentives that he does not want taxpayer money paying for the stadium itself but would be willing to use state money to help the team with infrastructure funding, which generally includes improvements to roads and other transportation-related initiatives.\n\n“We are helping businesses build infrastructure, for example, which they would need, and other things that are sort of available, again, to any business that is growing or building something new in the state of Illinois that’s putting people to work,” the governor said. “You know, those are normal incentives, and that’s what I would expect that we will end up with the Bears, you know, depending on where it goes.”\n\nA team consultant estimated last year that infrastructure improvements from near Illinois Route 53 and changes to a nearby Metra train line could cost more than $850 million in public funds. What’s more, the Bears would likely need megaproject legislation that would allow them to negotiate with local governments over property tax bills.\n\nAnother issue for Bears officials is more than $500 million in outstanding public debt from the controversial 2003 Soldier Field renovation, a tab currently covered by city hotel taxes and, when that falls short, by Chicago’s share of state income taxes. The Bears’ lease at Soldier Field expires in 2033, but it can be broken early with a penalty, and the team says it will take three years to build its new stadium.\n\nBut even with the debt paid off, that alone might not be enough to satisfy state lawmakers who represent swaths of Chicago and are reluctant to incentivize the team to move out of the city limits, even if it’s to Arlington Heights.\n\nIn Springfield a few weeks ago, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, a Democrat from Hillside, sent out a survey to other House Democrats about where they stand on the Bears issue. The results of that survey were not available.\n\nAs for whether he’s taking the Bears’ interest in relocating to Indiana seriously, Pritzker said Monday, “I never take anything as if it’s a bluff.”\n\n“I mean, I’m always concerned about making sure that we’re attracting businesses or keeping businesses in the state of Illinois,” he said. “So we’re in consistent conversation with the Chicago Bears — have been, by the way, for, I don’t know, a year and a half or two years. And specifically, I think there’s a real possibility that many of the things that we put on the table to work with the Bears on are things that they’re willing to do to stay in the state of Illinois.”",

Skattebo made headlines after he did a backflip in the end zone during a Sept. 28 game against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\"I mean, I had to get used to it, but it was different, but I've known that he's been like this, so he's been a superstar since I met him,\" Rodriguez says, of watching Skattebo build up a viral presence on and off the field.\n\n\"It's been awesome,\" Skattebo shares. \"With everything that's been coming my way, I've been taking it in and being able to navigate it in the right way and it's been great.\"\n\nSkattebo has become known for nonstop backflips, an aggressive playing style and running into telephone poles.\n\nSkattebo's mother, Becky Skattebo, previously gave a glimpse into the untraditional tactics her 23-year-old son would practice in his younger years in hopes of going pro during an ESPN interview.\n\n\"He would put his brother's shoulder pads on and he would run into telephone poles,\" Becky told the outlet. \"Once he got onto the field, it was no surprise the punishment he inflicted on his own body and everybody else.\"\n\nSkattebo and Rodriguez first met in college, when Rodriguez was a part of the Hornets cheerleading squad.\n\nSince then, she's been a staunch supporter of Skattebo. When he was selected by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, she commemorated the occasion with a post on Instagram showing the two celebrating.\n\n“I love supporting you, keep making us proud,\" she wrote. \"❤️ time to head back east, go @nygiants!”\n\nShe was there to see the Giants play the Los Angeles Chargers in September 2025, and she sometimes wears her boyfriend’s custom SKATT chain when watching him play.\n\nWhen Skattebo moved east to play for the Giants, Rodriguez joined him. In the summer of 2025, Rodriguez posted a photo of the N.Y.C. skyline on her Instagram Stories, tagging Skattebo and Hoboken, N.J., alongside a house emoji.",

    "fullText": "Had the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl on Sunday, their 2026 home showdown with the Denver Broncos would have been a perfect choice for the NFL's season opener.\n\nSuch a scenario is off the board after the Seattle Seahawks easily took care of business with a 29-13 win over New England in Super Bowl LX. That means Seattle is now set to host the NFL's 2026 season opener.\n\nThe Seahawks are among the Broncos' 2026 opponents, but that game is scheduled to be played in Denver. So the league will have Seattle open the season at Lumen Field against one of their home opponents.\n\nThe defending Super Bowl champion opening the season on the road is not unprecedented, but it is uncommon. Following the 2012 season, the Broncos hosted the Baltimore Ravens in Week 1 of the 2013 season, but that was due to unique circumstances.\n\nThe Ravens had a scheduling conflict with the MLB's Baltimore Orioles, so they were not able to play at home in Week 1, and the league instead scheduled a rematch with the team they knocked out of the 2012 playoffs. Denver won 49-27. The Seahawks don't have a scheduling conflict, so they will open the season at home.\n\nSeattle will also host the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers in 2026, but those teams are set to face off in Australia, likely in Week 1, this season.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Seahawks play Broncos in 2026, but not in season opener",

    "fullText": "Every NFL franchise dreams of reaching the Super Bowl, but for some teams the road to football’s biggest stage has been paved with more heartbreak than triumph. The list of most Super Bowl losses highlights organizations that have repeatedly come close to the ultimate prize only to fall short on the grandest stage. While losses can be tough for fans to swallow, they also reflect sustained excellence — getting to the championship game is itself a rare and remarkable achievement that only a handful of teams enjoy. From perennial contenders to decades-long underdogs, these franchises have forged identities around both drama and resilience.\n\nThe Patriots’ six Super Bowl losses are almost paradoxical when paired with their dynasty status. They reached the Super Bowl so often that disappointment became the price of sustained dominance. Several of those losses were razor-thin, last-minute heartbreaks that still sting New England fans. Ultimately, the volume of losses reflects just how frequently the Patriots lived on the NFL’s biggest stage.\n\nDenver’s Super Bowl losses include some of the most lopsided defeats in big-game history, which made them especially painful. For years, those blowouts defined the franchise more than its wins. Still, the Broncos kept returning, refusing to fade from relevance. Their later championships softened the scars, but those early losses remain unforgettable chapters.\n\nThe Bills’ four Super Bowl losses are unique — all came consecutively, an unmatched run of dominance and disappointment. That early-1990s team was powerful enough to rule the AFC but just couldn’t finish the job. Despite the heartbreak, Buffalo’s fanbase takes pride in that era’s consistency and grit. Those losses became part of the franchise’s identity rather than its undoing.\n\nMinnesota’s four Super Bowl defeats came during an era when the Vikings were perennial contenders. The “Purple People Eaters” defense struck fear across the league, yet the Lombardi Trophy always slipped away. That legacy of being close—but not close enough—has followed the franchise for decades. For Vikings fans, Super Bowl loss is both history and heartbreak.\n\nThe 49ers are better known for perfection in Super Bowls than failure, which makes their three losses stand out. Each defeat came during transitional moments between dominant eras. Rather than defining the franchise, those losses highlighted how high the standard was in San Francisco. Even in defeat, the 49ers were almost always contenders.\n\nAll three of Cincinnati’s Super Bowl losses came against the same opponent, giving the defeats an almost cruel symmetry. The Bengals were competitive in each appearance, often falling just short late. Those losses reinforced the narrative of a franchise knocking on the door but unable to break through. Recent success has reignited belief that history doesn’t have to repeat itself.\n\nPhiladelphia’s Super Bowl losses were emotional, hard-fought games that mirrored the city’s blue-collar identity. Each defeat deepened the hunger of one of the NFL’s most passionate fanbases. Those losses made eventual victory feel earned rather than inevitable. They’re reminders of how long the climb was before reaching the summit.\n\nThe Rams’ Super Bowl losses span multiple cities and eras, reflecting a franchise constantly reinventing itself. Some defeats were defensive struggles, others offensive collapses, but all were defining moments. Each loss forced organizational change and evolution. That adaptability eventually helped lead them back to championship success.\n\nMiami’s Super Bowl losses are often overshadowed by their perfect season and early dominance. Still, those defeats show how even elite teams aren’t immune to regression and disappointment. The Dolphins experienced both sides of football immortality within a short span. Their losses serve as a reminder that dynasties are fragile.\n\nDallas’ three Super Bowl losses sit quietly behind a louder legacy of championships. Each defeat came during eras of immense expectation and national spotlight. The losses didn’t diminish the brand, but they did humanize it. For “America’s Team,” even defeat became part of the mythology.\n\nThe Chiefs’ Super Bowl losses represent the bridge between old heartbreak and modern dominance. Before their recent success, Kansas City spent decades chasing relevance on the biggest stage. Those losses made the later championships feel transformational rather than routine. They’re proof that patience can eventually pay off in spectacular fashion.\n\nLooking across the history of the Super Bowl, patterns of near-misses and redemption emerge just as vividly as the glory of victory. The teams with the most losses have all carved out unique narratives — some marked by eras of dominance that ended in narrow defeat, others by periods of heartbreak that galvanized their fanbases. Yet for every loss on this list, there are lessons learned, legacies built, and the promise of future triumphs still to come. In the end, what matters as much as the losses are the stories of perseverance and passion that define these franchises and their supporters.\n\nThe post Teams with most losses in the Super Bowl appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "With Aden Durde having become the first overseas coach to win the Super Bowl, what does it mean for the NFL and the international game?",
    "fullText": "While most of the Seattle Seahawks' staff charged on to the field at the end of Super Bowl 60, Aden Durde took a moment for himself.\n\nHe was congratulated by one colleague but then threw his headset on to a sideline bench at Levi's Stadium, sat down and gazed skywards.\n\nAs fireworks and confetti filled the Santa Clara air, a smile spread across the Briton's face as it dawned on Durde what he had achieved.\n\nThe 46-year-old from north London had just become the first overseas coach to win American football's biggest prize.\n\nIt was a dream fulfilled, one that began with watching a video of the Chicago Bears team that won the Super Bowl in 1986.\n\nSome 40 years on, now he too is a Super Bowl champion and is inspiring others outside the US to follow their NFL dreams.\n\n\"It feels amazing,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I'm still trying to process it.\n\n\"To come from London and be here, I don't take any of that for granted. I'm so proud.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nDuring five years as defensive co-ordinator of the London Warriors, Durde was able to earn coaching internships with the Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons, before the latter made him Britain's first full-time NFL coach in 2018.\n\nHe progressed through roles with Atlanta and Dallas before Seattle's new head coach Mike Macdonald made Durde his defensive co-ordinator in 2024.\n\n'AD', as he is known at the Seahawks, has since helped create a defence he describes as \"fast, physical, ball-hungry, and they work as a collective\".\n\n\"AD is an absolute game-changer for us,\" said Macdonald on Monday. \"It's not just an incredible story that got him to this point, it's him as a football mind, a football coach.\n\n\"He's someone that has really brought us together, and the way that our defence plays inspired football is a great tribute to how AD operates, and what he brings to our football team and our organisation. I'm really happy for AD.\n\n\"He's just an absolute beast and he's so much fun to work with. He's right there alongside, building this whole thing. It's been a special journey.\"\n\nThe Seahawks dominated the New England Patriots to win 29-13 on Sunday, but Durde has not just become a Super Bowl champion, he has helped forge a defence that will go down in NFL folklore.\n\nSeattle's defence has been dubbed 'the Dark Side' and produced a performance long-time NFL analyst Cris Collinsworth said was \"as good as I have ever seen\".\n\n\"That's pretty cool,\" said Durde. \"But we have to give credit to the players. They made a commitment, they wanted to be the best in the world, and we got the outcome we wanted.\"\n\nWas this the ultimate Super Bowl redemption story?\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nAs he finished speaking to reporters after Sunday's game, with a British flag around his waist, Durde admitted he felt emotional.\n\n\"I'm trying to hold it back, I just want to get out of here,\" he joked.\n\nNFL analyst Phoebe Schecter used to coach with Durde on the NFL's International Player Pathway programme and shared a moment with him on the field.\n\n\"As someone that's known him for quite some time, [I know] he doesn't like to be emotional, but he couldn't help himself,\" she said.\n\n\"The moment is so big, the achievement is so big, and he knows that he's made history.\"\n\nDurde has spoken about being the best he can be, to make it easier for others to follow his lead, and Schecter is excited about what Durde's story means for the international game.\n\n\"Aden's great because he's not just thinking about himself in the moment,\" Schecter said.\n\n\"For years he's been thinking about other people, building the NFL Academy and the International Player Pathway programme. He's constantly sending that elevator back down.\n\n\"I think he knows how much it means, not just to the UK but to the rest of the international space, [for people] to think 'I could be that person one day, I could coach in the NFL'.\"\n\nWhile working with NFL UK, Durde shared an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora and they founded the IPP programme.\n\n\"I remember Osi telling me about [Durde] back in the day and then followed his journey,\" said NFL executive Peter O'Reilly.\n\n\"How talented he is and how well respected he is by his players, and what a great person he is, that just makes him someone you want to root for.\"\n\nThe IPP helped Britain's Efe Obada and Australia's Jordan Mailata get into the NFL, and former rugby league player Mailata won a Super Bowl last year with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"Whether it's coaching or playing, having those role models, those local heroes, where someone in the UK can look up and say 'OK, there's a path for me', is really important - like last year for a young Australian looking at Jordan Mailata,\" O'Reilly added.\n\n\"The IPP is also a great breeding ground for international coaches. You want that mix of coaches, and we've been in engaged in how we build that pipeline, making sure programmes for coaching development are not just US-based but global.\"\n\nAnd Durde has challenged others to take a shot, saying: \"You just have to set goals and understand there's always people out there that do believe in you. You've just got to push forward and go for what you believe in. That's what life's about.\"\n\nWhat's next for NFL as latest international games confirmed?\n\nOnce Durde joined Seattle's on-field celebrations at Levi's Stadium, he was joined by his wife Kate and their two sons.\n\nTheir eldest son, Kane Doyle-Durde, now works as a scout for the Dallas Cowboys and their youngest Dylan is working in coaching.\n\n\"We just hugged, we were grateful for the moment,\" said Durde.\n\n\"A lot of people have sacrificed a lot for me to be sitting here, but you don't see all the people around me that helped me get here. I'm very grateful for them.\"\n\nThey include many back in the UK, who Durde aims to catch up with now the NFL season is over.\n\n\"I've got to get back to London, get this mayhem out of the way,\" he laughed. \"I need to go home.\"\n\nIn particular, Durde is looking forward to seeing his close friend Marvin Allen, one of a few Britons to own a Super Bowl ring having been on the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice squad when they became NFL champions in 2009.\n\nDurde had two interviews for head-coach positions during the current hiring cycle and - although he is set to remain with Seattle next season - Allen is confident he will become the NFL's first overseas head coach.\n\n\"Aden has come from obscurity to take an American sport by storm,\" he said.\n\n\"One day NFL owners will say 'this guy that's comes from nowhere to win a Super Bowl, let's give that guy a go'.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Winning a Super Bowl is the highest mark of success for an NFL head coach. Only a small group of active coaches can say they have done it. Some built long careers around steady success. Others reached the top early in their coaching journey. Each of these coaches shaped their teams in a different way. Their titles show strong leadership, smart planning, and the ability to win on the biggest stage. Here is a look at the active Super Bowl-winning head coaches.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LX)\n\nMike Macdonald is the newest coach to join this list. He led the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl LX win in 2026. Seattle defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to earn its second title in franchise history.\n\nHis defensive game plan was the key to the victory. Seattle’s defense controlled the Patriots’ offense from start to finish. Pressure came from all angles and forced mistakes.\n\nThat championship made Macdonald one of the youngest head coaches to win a Super Bowl. The win also proved his defensive style can work at the highest level. Seattle now looks to build around that success for future seasons.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLVII with Baltimore Ravens)\n\nJohn Harbaugh won his Super Bowl with the Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII. That victory helped define his long career in Baltimore. He became known as a coach who could win with strong defense and smart special teams play.\n\nHis teams stayed competitive through many roster changes. New players came in and old stars moved on. Success continued because Harbaugh adjusted his approach to fit his personnel.\n\nHowever, following a disappointing 2025 regular season, Harbaugh was fired from Balti\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLIV)\n\nSean Payton earned his Super Bowl title with the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV. His offense stood out for its creativity and balance. Play calling became a major part of his reputation.\n\nLater, he moved to the Denver Broncos to begin a new chapter. Experience gives him an edge in building a culture of discipline and preparation.\n\nOffensive ideas from Payton influenced many coaches around the league. His teams often play with speed and confidence. Denver now relies on that knowledge to return to championship form.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LVI)\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a title in Super Bowl LVI. He became known for modern offensive design and clear communication with his players.\n\nYouth never slowed him down. Playoff runs became common under his leadership. Los Angeles stayed competitive in a tough division because of his planning and play structure.\n\nEach season shows his ability to adapt. Changes at quarterback and defense never stopped his teams from finding ways to win. Many see him as one of the smartest minds in football today.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LIX)\n\nNick Sirianni reached the top with the Eagles during a time when offense ruled the league. His coaching focused on balance and teamwork.\n\nRoster development became one of his strengths. Young players improved quickly under his system. Veterans also fit well into his plans.\n\nPhiladelphia built a strong identity with him in charge. Toughness and energy defined the team’s style. A Bowl win confirmed his place among the league’s top young coaches.\n\nAndy Reid leads this list with three Super Bowl titles. His record shows long-term excellence and steady results. Kansas City became a powerhouse under his leadership.\n\nOffensive creativity sets him apart. Play designs keep defenses guessing every season. Quarterbacks thrive in his system because it allows freedom and structure at the same time.\n\nYears of playoff success place him among the best in NFL history. Consistency defines his career more than any single season. Few active coaches match his résumé.\n\nActive Super Bowl-winning head coaches represent the highest level of achievement in the NFL. Each one reached the top through different paths. Some relied on defense. Others built great offenses. Experience and adaptability connect them all. Their championships show what strong leadership can do for a team. As seasons continue, these coaches will try to add more titles and strengthen their legacy.\n\nThe post Active Super Bowl winning head coaches in the NFL appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold leading the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl glory could just be the greatest redemption story ever in the NFL. We take a closer look.",
    "fullText": "The Sam Darnold redemption story is quite something - from being rated as one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL to Super Bowl champion.\n\nIt's a tale of never giving up, of character, unwavering self-belief and persistence, but also a warning for teams not to write a quarterback off too soon.\n\nAs youngsters being drafted into the NFL are at the mercy of circumstance, not every team will fit every rookie and the sport's history is littered with college stars deemed not good enough.\n\nThey often bounce around from team to team, as Darnold did, but never has one plumbed the depths before managing to rise up and claim the sport's ultimate prize in the ultimate NFL redemption story.\n\nSeahawks beat Patriots to win Super Bowl 60 with crushing defensive display - as it happened\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to win Super Bowl\n\nSo how bad was Darnold? Well, the numbers were not great, as after being drafted in 2018 he spent three seasons with the New York Jets and two with the Carolina Panthers - during which time he ranked bottom or near the bottom in several areas.\n\nWins were the main one - just 21 of them in five seasons - but categories like passer rating and completion percentage were the worst of any quarterback during that time.\n\nAs a third pick in the draft he was ridiculed for his \"seeing ghosts\" comment as he struggled, and labelled a bust, but now he's getting fitted for a Super Bowl ring it's clear he was only part of the problem.\n\nFellow Jets quarterbacks Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith and Zach Wilson also all finished dead last in passer rating in their first three seasons with the team. Notice a theme?\n\nThat's a quirk of the NFL Draft system, the best players go to the worst teams, and while some could just be having an off season so can build for success, some have serious issues.\n\nAfter Sunday, Darnold has now won 39 games since leaving New York, including serving two years as a back-up - the Jets have won just 26.\n\nThe Panthers have won 15 to Darnold's 31 since leaving Carolina and even the Vikings and 49ers can't match his wins since he departed.\n\nPeople forget that at just 21 he was the youngest NFL starting quarterback since the 1970 merger - perhaps the young man was just in the wrong place after all.\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\n\"Quarterbacks need tonnes of help to allow you to go show how great you can be. If you do not get that help, you are limited in how great you can be,\" said former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and three-time Super Bowl champion Steve Young.\n\n\"And there are not 32 places in the league today that can give you that help.\"\n\nYoung knows when a team is not a good fit, as he was drafted by a poor Tampa Bay squad and won three games in two seasons before leaving to join the 49ers and eventually becoming a Hall of Fame member.\n\nIronically enough it was a largely forgotten season in San Francisco that also provided the catalyst for Darnold to launch the comeback of all comebacks.\n\n\"I didn't play great football the first few years of my career,\" Darnold admitted after the Super Bowl. \"Then I come here to San Francisco and I think because of that year I was able to learn a tonne. I was able to kind of learn and go to Minnesota and play good football there. I was able to come to Seattle and do the same.\"\n\nWorking in a fully functioning franchise, learning from coach Kyle Shanahan and serving as back-up to Brock Purdy in a Super Bowl saw Darnold head to Minnesota better equipped to succeed.\n\nThe irony of returning to Levi's Stadium for his crowning glory was not lost on him.\n\nA stellar season in Minnesota came after he replaced injured rookie JJ McCarthy, but then more irony in the Vikings opting to stick with the quarterback they drafted saw Darnold move on again.\n\nHe left after massive career highs of 14 wins, over 4,000 yards and 35 touchdowns, but still with question marks after a play-off capitulation against the Rams.\n\nOnce again, he had a point to prove.\n\nQuarterbacks grab all the headlines, for good or bad, but they simply cannot do it all by themselves in this ultimate team sport.\n\nTom Brady regularly had, and needed, a top-10 defence on his side to win Super Bowls, while Patrick Mahomes lost two of them because he was soundly beaten up by opposing defences.\n\nIn Seattle, Darnold found the perfect storm of a team on the up and a defensive head coach assembling a crack unit that would go on to dominate the NFL, needing just a solid quarterback to steer the offence.\n\nHaving the league's leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Super Bowl MVP running back Kenneth Walker also helped, and plenty will say Darnold did not have to do much.\n\nHe became the first quarterback to enjoy successive 14-win seasons with two different teams - only Brady had managed it with one - but still there were questions as he led the league in turnovers, giving the ball away 20 times.\n\nAround 80% of play-off games are won by teams with the fewest turnovers. In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nDarnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.\n\nThe response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.\n\nHe answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.\n\nWas it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.\n\nNo quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.\n\nLuck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.\n\nNone have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it. His redemption story really is one for the ages.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures",

    "fullText": "The NFL inevitably will expand the regular season to 18 games. It's a matter of \"when\" not \"if.\"\n\nAs to the when, it could still happen the season after next.\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the situation, the lingering absence of a specific date for Super Bowl LXII in Atlanta is tied directly to the possibility of the season expanding for the 2027 season. With 17 games, the game would be played most likely on Sunday, February 13. With 18 games, it would slide to Sunday, February 20.\n\nAnd if 18 games comes with a second bye, the NFL likely would have to start the 2027 season on Labor Day weekend. That hasn't happened since 2001.\n\nLast Monday, Commissioner Roger Goodell said it's \"not a given\" that the regular-season will expand. The next day, interim NFL Players Association executive director David White said the players have \"no appetite\" for adding another game.\n\nOnce the NFLPA hires a permanent executive director, the league apparently plans to make a move on moving the season to 18. And the door for 18 by 2027 will remain open until Super Bowl LXII locks into February 13, 2028.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 season is complete after a thrilling Super Bowl. Now the work begins for all 32 teams to retool their roster and prepare for a potential playoff appearance next season. After an offensive coordinator and passing game coordinator change, the Eagles' roster will likely undergo further changes. The Birds have 21 players who'll test the restricted or unrestricted free-agent market during the 2026 NFL offseason. Several key factors include a pending contract extension for Jalen Carter and the contract status for star tight end Dallas Goedert.\n\nReed Blankenship is one of the biggest names on the list, and the defense could look drastically different with Nakobe Dean entering the final year of his rookie deal.\n\nWith the off-season officially underway in Philadelphia, we're looking at nine players who seem likely to depart.\n\nThe 27-year-old Uche played in 12 games and recorded 1 sack.\n\nOjulari saw action in three games before spending the bulk of the season on IR.\n\nThe 2022 sixth-round pick just finished his fourth season in the NFL, and likely played his last game in Philadelphia. A Former college teammate of Jalen Hurts at Oklahoma, eaching the end of his rookie contract. Calcaterra played in 62 games with 22 starts.\n\nA former Commanders first-round pick, Dotson spent two unproductive seasons with the Eagles, playing in 34 games and recording 37 catches on 69 targets for 478 yards and one regular-season touchdown.\n\nA versatile and solid lineman, the 29-year-old played 363 snaps at center and guard, allowing two sacks.\n\nThe Eagles acquired Howell via trade in August, making him the third-string quarterback. He didn't play a single game with the Eagles this season, but could certainly return.\n\nOkoronkwo played in just one game this season and landed on IR.\n\nDillon signed a one-year deal with Philadelphia after missing last season with a neck injury, but things didn't work out. The veteran running back lost his role when the Eagles brought in Tank Bigsby via trade. Dillon, 27, ended up with just 12 rushing attempts for 60 yards this season.\n\nThe Eagles signed Epps to their practice squad at the start of the season and eventually promoted him to the active roster. When rookie Drew Mukuba fractured his ankle, Epps regained his starting role at safety next to Blankenship.\n\nThe 30-year-old veteran signed a one-year deal with the Eagles in the offseason and improved for Vic Fangio as the season went on, outplaying Kelee Ringo and Jakorian Bennett.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Free Agency: 9 Eagles players who seem likely to depart",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump reacted forcefully to Super Bowl 60, calling for immediate change after what he described as a damaging moment for the NFL.\n\nFollowing the game, the former US president focused his criticism on the halftime show and quickly expanded his comments to include league policy.\n\nTrump shared his reaction in a post published by TrumpTruthOnX, responding directly to Bad Bunny’s halftime performance.\n\nHe wrote, “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, ever! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of success, creativity, or excellence.\n\n“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children who are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”\n\nThe comments were uncompromising and immediate. Trump framed the halftime show not as a matter of taste, but as a failure to reflect what he believes the Super Bowl should represent.\n\nAs has often been the case, Trump’s reaction quickly spread across social media, becoming part of the wider debate surrounding the NFL’s entertainment choices.\n\nTrump’s post did not stop at the halftime show. He also used the moment to call out a specific NFL rule change.\n\nHe continued, “This ‘show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the best Stock Market and 401(k)s in history!\n\n“There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a halftime show and watch, it will get great reviews from the fake news media, because they haven’t got a clue of what is going on in the real world, and, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new kickoff rule. Make America great again!”\n\nThe mention of the kickoff rule stood out. Rather than limiting his response to entertainment, Trump shifted attention to on-field changes introduced by the league.\n\nHis criticism suggested frustration with what he sees as unnecessary adjustments to the game itself.\n\nThe NFL’s revised kickoff rule, which was introduced in 2024, has already divided fans, with some praising the improvements and others arguing it removes excitement.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 fallout continues, the former president’s comments ensured the halftime show debate expanded beyond music.\n\nIt became, once again, a flashpoint for how sport, culture, and politics intersect on the biggest stage.\n\nDonald Trump goes off on ‘worst ever’ Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show\n\nImane Khelif has a brutal reminder for Donald Trump, names only way she will ‘respect’ the US President\n\nWho Donald Trump picked as Super Bowl LX winners between Patriots and Seahawks",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen the Seattle Seahawks finally turn the page to the offseason, they'll have a big decision to make on running back Kenneth Walker.\n\nThat's because the former second-round pick is a pending free agent after spending all four of his NFL seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nHere's a look at who much Walker is expected to make in free agency.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Walker is estimated to land a four-year, $33.5 million deal in free agency, which is realistic for a few reasons.\n\nFor starters, Walker will be one of the best running backs available in free agency and should draw plenty of interest.

    "fullText": "NFL legendary wide receiver Randy Moss didn’t mince words when addressing Pro Football Hall of Fame voters snubbing his former coach, Bill Belichick, from the Hall. Belichick’s name appeared on the ballot for the first time this year, but he will have to wait one more year to get inducted into the HOF.\n\nThe decision sparked plenty of reactions from former NFL players. Things got worse after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft also didn’t make it. During a Sunday appearance on ESPN’s “NFL Countdown,” Moss sent a strong message to the voters and the people who put them there. He stated that if they weren’t a player or a coach, they shouldn’t have a say on who gets in.\n\n“I’m not gon’ to really sit up here and just badmouth the Hall, ’cause there are some guys that just got selected to this year’s Pro Football Hall of Fame that I do not want to take the light from,” Moss said. “But one thing about not electing Robert Kraft, not electing Bill Belichick, the one thing that I would talk to all the voters. I really believe, as a football player, if you didn’t play it, if you didn’t coach it, you shouldn’t have a vote. I don’t care who you are, I don’t care how you feel about it. Like I said, I don’t wanna take no shine away from the guys elected today, and that’s it for me.”\n\n\"If you didn't play it, if you didn't coach it, you shouldn't have a vote.\"\n\n—@RandyMoss on Hall of Fame voting after Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were not selected\n\n— NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) February 8, 2026\n\nRandy Moss was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018, following a terrific career as one of the greatest wide receivers the game has ever seen. Eight years later, Belichick had the chance to join him in the Hall, but things didn’t go as expected.\n\nMoss wasn’t the only legend who thought former players and coaches should be the ones voting, not writers and journalists. On Friday, he told Kevin Clark on “This is Football” that only people already in the Hall of Fame should allow or deny entrance to candidates.\n\n“I wouldn’t want the grinch who stole Christmas voting on a beauty pageant,” Sanders said.\n\nDeion Sanders believes only Hall of Famers should vote on the Hall of Fame. \n\n\"I wouldnt want the grinch who stole Christmas voting on a beauty pageant. \"\n\nI said I think writers do a good job following the league.\n\n\"No, they don't\" -Coach Prime.\n\nIncredible This Is Football pic.twitter.com/wIUcIGXeDk\n\n— Kevin Clark (@bykevinclark) February 6, 2026\n\nThe Belichick situation could result in major changes in the voting process.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\n\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NFL legend Randy Moss goes off on HOF voters after Bill Belichick snub appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Sam Darnold has been facing challenges all throughout his time playing football since his days at San Clemente (Calif.). Now the former California high school football star will get his chance on the grandest stage of them all, Super Bowl LX, to show why he’s one of the best to have ever come out of the Golden State.\n\nThrough Darnold’s sophomore and junior seasons with the Tritons, the Super Bowl starting quarterback had seen minimal time on the field at San Clemente, totaling 748 yards and seven touchdowns. It would be Darnold’s senior year where the signal caller would blossom into his own before heading off to become a USC Trojan.\n\nDuring his senior campaign with the Tritons, Darnold had himself a strong season and ended up completing 213-of-314 passes for 2,985 yards and 39 touchdowns. The four-star prospect showed off his wheels on the ground, rushing for 785 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nAfter his high school playing days at San Clemente, Darnold was already committed to USC, making his decision during the summer of 2014 heading into his senior season and would head into a crowded quarterback room with the Trojans.\n\nPlaying two seasons at USC with a redshirt freshman campaign, the 6-foot-3, 221-pound passer completing 549-of-846 passes for 7,229 yards and 57 touchdowns before being selected as the No. 3 pick of the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Jets.\n\nNow heading into Sunday’s Super Bowl matchup with the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Darnold has a chance one more time to prove the naysayers wrong and overcoming one more challenge in his path.\n\n“Sam Darnold was sort of a late bloomer (in high school). USC had their quarterback room all set and it was gonna go from (Cody) Kessler to Ricky Town. A lot of schools early on wanted Sam to play tight end. The issue at that time he wasn’t doing a lot of camps or 7-on-7. First time I saw him at Mission Viejo 7-on-7 tournament and he was outstanding. He made all the the grows and was superb. The way his recruitment went, he to a camp at USC and Clay Helton was the HC at the time. The staff said they had to go after him at the time after seeing him. Oregon, Duke were also after him during the recruitment him. Darnold and his dad went to a lot of USC games. I think that’s a testament to his fortitude. Is it surprising, certainly. Just knowing him and his HC. Knowing he’s a tough kid. He was walking into a very tough QB at USC and he stayed resilient.” – Rivals National Recruiting reporter Adam Gorney\n\nSan Clemente High School, located in the coastal town of San Clemente, California, serves around 3,000 students from the city and surrounding areas, including Capistrano Beach and San Juan Capistrano. Established in 1964, the school is part of the Capistrano Unified School District and boasts a robust athletics program with a strong community presence under the motto “One Town, One Team.” The Tritons are recognized for their competitive spirit across various sports disciplines.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "To prepare the field for an NFL game in less than 18 hours, crews have to strip and repaint the field, clean 2 million square feet of stadium space, and fire up thousands of meals in crowded kitchens, all in a matter of hours.\n\nThe first step in clearing the field and prepping for it to be painted with the Falcons' logo is collecting roughly 5 million pieces of confetti launched from confetti cannons.\n\nCleanup crews use rakes, leaf blowers, and utility vehicles fitted with large nets to collect every last piece — even the smallest piece of debris can interfere with repainting the turf.\n\nThe paint removal process takes around one to two hours to complete.\n\nTo speed things up, P-Rex machines spray a cleaning solution onto painted logos and use spinning brushes and a vacuum to remove the paint.\n\nThe process is surprisingly precise. Too many chemicals can soak the turf, and too much pressure can permanently damage the field.\n\nEvery area has to be cleared of waste, including the private suites, locker rooms, kitchens, and stadium bowl seating.\n\nIn the seating bowl, workers hand-pick everything from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to food containers and pom-poms, with each person assigned a specific type of waste to speed up sorting.\n\nAfter trash is collected from the stands, power-washing crews race behind the waste-collecting crews, scrubbing away spills and sticky residue before the next crowd arrives.\n\nEven though waste is pre-sorted, each bag still has to be inspected.\n\nThe goal: recycle or compost 96% of all waste generated during the event.\n\nOnce paint is removed from the field, the turf must completely dry before repainting can begin.\n\nGrounds crews use this small window of time to prep stencils and get ready to tackle the \"hot areas\" of the field — the center logo and the end zones — which are the most time-consuming.\n\nThe logo is hand-painted using spraying machines that ensure accuracy.\n\nCrews have to pay special attention to the sidelines and end zones to ensure everything is up to code before kickoff.\n\nAbout 100 cooks prepare different menus for concessions, suites, catering, and eight all-inclusive clubs — some serving up to 1,000 people.\n\nAt this game, the stadium's food team sold more than 25,000 hot dogs, 10,000 slices of pizza, and over 5,000 pounds of wings.\n\nThe menu changes for every event, and food is largely prepared in a central kitchen and distributed to multiple secondary kitchens throughout the stadium.\n\nExecutive chef Matt Cooper told Business Insider that having detailed boards allows him to keep track of his massive team and ensure everything runs smoothly.\n\n\"This is the magic behind everything we do,\" he said. \"We have all the chefs, all the supervisors, junior sous chefs, all the cooks, and we're able to kind of move the pieces around. It's a big kitchen, a lot of space, and I love being able to kind of visualize and see the whole team.\"\n\nAt the same time, club spaces are stocked with fruit and sandwich trays, employees place fan giveaway items on every seat inside the stadium, and excitement builds for kickoff.\n\nLights flash, cameras roll, fans cheer, and players take the field, with most of the stadium's attendees oblivious to the overnight operation that made it all happen.\n\nWhen the final whistle blows, it's mere hours before employees at Mercedes-Benz Stadium start planning for the next event.",

    "description": "Iowa State's \"Big Citrus\" offers size and surprising athleticism. Could Domonique Orange be the run-stuffing force the Green Bay Packers desperately need?",
    "fullText": "It may feel a bit too early to start thinking about the 2026 NFL Draft, but mock draft season will be upon us before you know it. In fact, for many fans, mock draft season started the minute the Green Bay Packers' 2025 season ended.\n\nA lot is going to happen between now and April 23rd, when the draft kicks off in Pittsburgh. Right now, the Packers don't have a first-round pick, and they'll start their selections with pick No. 52, which is in the second round.\n\nNot having a first-rounder in the 2026 and 2027 NFL Drafts was part of the price the Packers paid for getting Micah Parsons. They gave a lot to get a lot back in return, and that's just part of the reality general manager Brian Gutekunst will have to work with unless he's able to swing another trade and somehow get back into the first round.\n\nSo who should the Packers target in Round 2 and beyond? There are going to be a ton of names thrown around and many of them will be great picks.\n\nEarlier this week, we focused on Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker.\n\nNow, let's talk about Iowa State defensive lineman Domonique Orange:\n\nOrange may have the best nickname in the 2026 NFL Draft, and you can absolutely make the case that he has one of the best nicknames of all time.\n\nThey call him \"Big Citrus\", and there's a reason for that. Orange checks in at 6-foot-4, 325 pounds.\n\nHe's a big dude, and he knows what to do with his size.\n\nOrange is a run-stuffer, without a doubt. He's the guy you put at nose-tackle or one technique and ask him to take up a double team. The thing about him, though, is that he's surprisingly athletic for his size.\n\nNobody is going to confuse him with Devonte Wyatt, who is actually a great pass-rusher for being 6-foot-3, 304 pounds, but \"Big Citrus\" has the quick-twitch to be able to shoot the gap, and he's good at using his hands to get blockers off him.\n\nDomonique Orange (95) aligned head up on the RT before penetrating and eating the RB\n\nBig Citrus with a healthy dose of vitamin C-eek and destroy. Get it? Thank you for your time\n\n pic.twitter.com/lybgr8haI9\n\n— Anthony Cover 1 (@Pro__Ant) February 6, 2026\n\nThe Packers struggled a bit against the run this past season, averaging 117.7 yards per game given up on the ground.\n\nAdding Orange to this offensive line would go a long way. Speaking of Wyatt, he should be healthy by the start of the 2026 season, so new defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon would be able to pair him and Orange together on the inside. Both of those players will demand double-teams, but so does Micah Parsons on the edge.\n\nOrange is projected as a third-round pick but the Packers would absolutely be justified taking him in the second round. Even if they don't select him at No. 52, there's a chance he's still there at pick No. 84 in the third round, but if they like him, they may want to jump on him while they're able to in round two.\n\nPackersRoundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "description": "The daughter of NFL Hall of Famer Tom Mack reflects on growing up with a legendary player who balanced football, work, and family.",
    "fullText": "On the occasion of my father's 82nd birthday, I called him to wish him well. As we chatted, I told him about a social media post shared by his former team, the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nMy dad doesn't pay attention to social media, so he wouldn't know that the post had garnered hundreds of likes and comments. Many fans wished him a happy birthday, while others recalled his skill on the field and their favorite memories of watching him play.\n\n\"That's neat,\" my father said in his understated manner. I could hear the smile in his voice.\n\nMy father, Tom Mack, was an offensive lineman for the Los Angeles Rams from 1966 through 1978. He played in 184 consecutive games over 13 seasons, served as team captain, and was named to 11 Pro Bowls. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nBut to me, he's just my dad. He walks his dog, attends church, and shops at Walmart. People usually don't recognize him as one of the game's all-time greats.\n\nWhen I was growing up as the daughter of an NFL player in the 1970s, there were definitely some perks, like the trip our family took to Hawaii when my dad participated in a celebrity rodeo. After home games, my two sisters and I, along with my mom, would greet our dad outside his locker room at the Los Angeles Coliseum. My sisters and I would run around with our autograph books getting signatures from teammates, including Merlin Olsen and Jack Youngblood.\n\nI admit I'm a bit jealous of today's NFL kids, who seem to get on the field regularly. I only stepped on the field with my dad once, for the Pro Bowl in 1979, his final game.\n\nWhile going on the field was rare, seeing him on television was another perk of having an NFL dad, especially back when there were so few channels. He was interviewed on the news and appeared in local commercials. It was especially exciting when he guest-starred on the popular series \"Six Million Dollar Man,\" playing a bad guy in a slow-motion football match against Lee Majors as Steve Austin.\n\nIt wasn't all glamorous, though. Even though he played 13 seasons, his entire career occurred before the advent of cable TV and huge salaries.\n\nIn fact, my dad and his teammates worked other jobs during the offseason. Some of them sold cars or real estate, while my dad worked as a mechanical engineer for a global engineering and construction company.\n\nAs a kid, I didn't think of my dad as someone with two careers. I just knew he went to work. What mattered to me was that he ate dinner with us and came to my soccer games and ballet recitals.\n\nOther people, however, seemed far more interested in what he didn't have.\n\nMy sisters and I were athletic and enjoyed playing sports when women's sports were in their infancy. People asked us constantly if we had any brothers. Whenever I replied no, I was struck by how many strangers asked, \"Didn't your dad want sons?\"\n\nMy dad never made me feel like he wanted sons, and my mom echoed that. He had grown up in the shadow of his own father, who played Major League Baseball, and knew the weight that came with that legacy. He always told me he was happy to raise girls without the pressure to follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhen he retired at the end of the 1978 NFL season, he went to work full-time as an engineer, and my family left the football world behind. Surprisingly, we moved across the country more for his engineering career than for football.\n\nWhen he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999, it was fun to revisit his career. Each summer, he returns to Canton, Ohio, for enshrinement weekend, reconnecting with teammates and other legends. The Rams organization treats him well, too, checking in and welcoming him back to games.\n\nI love it when fans recognize him. When it does, fans get stars in their eyes. From the time I was a little girl until now, I've witnessed my dad remain humble and gracious with every fan he meets.\n\nI think of him not as one of the NFL's greatest players, but simply as my dad. He modeled hard work and humility with a dash of humor, remaining competitive even off the field — he never lost a board game to my sisters or me until we could beat him on our own merit. He took me fishing and camping, taught me to drive a stick shift, and walked me down the aisle.\n\nHe may have been a legendary football player, but I'd argue he's an even greater dad.",

If that vote had gone to Maye instead of Herbert, the outcome of the MVP race may have very well been different.\n\nStafford was named the 2025 NFL MVP after an impressive season under center for the Rams.

    "description": "The Super Bowl team's logo originates with a First Nations tribe in Canada.",
    "fullText": "Wallace Nagedzi Watts had been going to Seahawks games for almost three decades when a historical discovery helped supercharge his fandom - and deepened his connection to his indigenous roots.\n\n\"It kind of changed my whole life,\" says Watts, a prominent fan of the American football team who goes by the name Captain Seahawk.\n\n\"Because of the Seattle Seahawks I started getting back into my culture.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC while driving down to attend the Super Bowl game in Santa Clara, California, where the Seahawks are due to take on the New England Patriots, Watts says \"it's been my life's mission for the last 12 years to notify everyone that the Seahawks logo was copied from the Kwakwaka'wakw tribe on Vancouver Island\".\n\nThe discovery was made during the Seahawks last Super Bowl sting - coincidentally also against the Patriots - in 2014.\n\nAmid city-wide excitement, the Burke Museum in Seattle decided to investigate the origins of the Seahawks logo, which was chosen by the team's manager in the mid-1970s. A black-and-white photo of a ceremonial mask in an old art book revealed the inspiration behind the design, which was then traced to a collection at the Hudson Museum in Maine.\n\nThe museum sent the mask to Seattle on loan, where a ceremony was held featuring both tribal members and team representatives.\n\nThe mask, which was created in the late 1800s and was carved from cedar, had been in private collections since leaving Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where it was created by members of the Kwakwaka'wakw Nation, says Katie Bunn-Marcuse, the curator of Northwest Native Art at the Burke Museum.\n\nThe carving, which is known as a \"transformational mask\" and depicts the ancestral origins of one's family, was created around the time that Canada introduced a ban on many indigenous practices, in a move which decimated many tribes in western Canada.\n\nUsing the mask for its intended purpose, at large gatherings called potlaches, became a crime. Many people went to jail for their cultural practices, however, the Kwakwaka'wakw people continued to hold underground potlaches.\n\n\"The Indian Act banned people gathering and performing their songs,\" says Bunn-Marcuse, adding, that \"the potlatch was the economic and legal system of the coast\". The ban was lifted in 1951, and in 2015 Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that it was part of a \"cultural genocide\", which also included the notorious residential school programme, which separated families and erased local languages.\n\nWatts grew up on a reservation in Port Alberni on the west side of Vancouver Island, in his father's tribal community. But after the discovery of the logo's Kwakwaka'wakw origins, he decided to look into his mother's family history on the other side of the island.\n\nTravelling back to Vancouver Island, he set out on a series of tribal canoe journeys, where he reconnected with Kwakwaka'wakw family members and learned more about their cultural practices.\n\nDuring one trip, he was invited to take place in a ritual in which he was declared a \"warrior\", or guardian of the tribe's culture.\n\n\"I had to dance half-naked in front of a thousand people, and then I came back in warriors clothing. To me it's like being baptised as a Christian. It really changed my life.\"\n\nBruce Alfred, an artist living in Alert Bay, British Columbia, recalls when his cousin started showing up, inspired by his commitment to the Seahawks and his cultural heritage. He says that Watts is not the only person who has been inspired by the NFL team to look into their family history.\n\nAlfred was part of the Burke team that surveyed the mask, and confirmed that it was indeed Kwakwaka'wakw, and had been used in spiritual ceremonies before going into a private collection.\n\n\"After the potlatch ban they took everything away from our people,\" he says, adding that the goal of the government and missionaries was to \"annihilate and assimilate us - either one\".\n\nThe Seahawks are popular throughout Canada's western coast, where no other NFL team exists. Alfred says that many people in his village are Seahawks supporters, and that more people have been inspired to look into their heritage after discovering the team's connection. It comes amid a larger tribal movement to reconnect with the past.\n\n\"There is a resurgence of our people that are stepping up and they're learning the language, the culture, their own identity,\" he says.\n\nAlfred, and other indigenous people who spoke to the BBC, say that unlike other major league sports teams, the Seahawks logo has not sparked backlash because it respectfully borrows from indigenous culture, rather than plays in to racist stereotypes.\n\nThe display of indigenous cultural materials as artworks has been criticised by some tribal people, who see these as sacred tools for worship.\n\nAt the Kwakwaka'wakw exhibit at the University of British Columbia's Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver, one mask is kept under a sheet to symbolically show how some believe these objects should not be displayed, and only taken out for important occasions.\n\nThe debate is always ongoing for museums that display indigenous relics, says Bunn-Marcuse.\n\n\"In community, many of these masks are not brought out until the moment that they are needed,\" she says.\n\n\"Whenever we do our exhibits we do them collaboratively with input and advising by community members. So there are some masks that we no longer show because community has said those are not appropriate to be shown ever outside of their ceremonial context.\"\n\nOthers have critiqued the artwork for originating from a tribe that is hundreds of miles from Seattle, halfway to Alaska. The artwork of local peoples such as the Coast Salish could be used instead, they argue.\n\nQwalsius-Shaun Peterson, a Coast Salish artist from the Puyallup Tribe near Tacoma, Washington, is among many indigenous artists who have redesigned unofficial Seahawks logos in the style of their own local culture.\n\n\"People within the tribal communities are just really excited about native iconography of any kind,\" he says.\n\n\"Nobody takes offense\" to the official logo, he adds, adding that it is not a \"misrepresentation\" and instead \"borrows from\" indigenous art.\n\nWatts, who proudly boasts that he's the first person to arrive at games and the last to leave, is using his celebrity status as a superfan to fund raise for multiple charities.\n\nHe also cooks at a food bank, and mentors Native American youths in prison.\n\n\"I really had a different outlook on my entire life\" after connecting with the roots of the logo, Watts says.\n\n\"We're supposed to be the guardians of our tribe. We protect and provide.\"\n\nTotem pole to return to dockland home\n\nAn underwater mystery on Canada's coast\n\nA surprising way of showing gratitude",

Defensive end and defensive tackle depth are needs -- not to mention that the Jaguars could use more pass rush juice from the interior.\n\nThen, depending on whether or not Devin Lloyd returns, that will determine how big of a need linebacker is.\n\nOn offense, adding to the offensive line and tight end positions could be on Gladstone's radar. Depth at most positions is always welcomed as well.\n\nAfter trading up for Travis Hunter in last year's draft, the Jaguars do not own their first-round pick this year.

    "description": "An NFL insider has named the Detroit Lions as a serious trade contender for Raiders star Maxx Crosby. Here’s why the fit makes sense.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions just got pulled into one of the biggest trade rumors of the entire offseason.\n\nDuring Super Bowl LX week, NFL insider Jeremy Fowler of ESPN named the Lions as one of several “natural would-be contenders” to pursue Raiders star defensive end Maxx Crosby, a revelation that immediately caught the attention of fans across the league.\n\nThe timing isn’t accidental. Earlier in the week, Fox Sports insider Jay Glazer reported that Crosby may be “done” with Las Vegas, setting off widespread speculation about where one of the NFL’s most relentless pass rushers could land next.\n\nDetroit is firmly in win-now mode, and the idea of pairing Crosby with Aidan Hutchinson is the kind of move that could change the balance of power in the NFC.\n\nCrosby has been one of the league’s most consistent edge defenders over the last seven seasons, earning two All-Pro selections and five Pro Bowl nods. Adding him opposite Hutchinson would give the Lions one of the most feared pass-rush duos in football — something this defense has lacked in high-leverage playoff moments.\n\nAccording to Fowler, Crosby’s priority is clear:\n\n“What has been made clear to me: Crosby wants to be a part of a winner. That’s the priority.”\n\nThat alone puts Detroit squarely in the conversation.\n\nFowler reported that trade interest in Crosby is massive, with more than a dozen teams expected to at least inquire. Among the contenders he specifically listed were the Bills, Lions, 49ers, Cowboys, and Ravens — a group made up almost entirely of Super Bowl-caliber teams.\n\nCrosby has remained loyal to the Raiders throughout his career, but Fowler noted that loyalty could soon be tested. Las Vegas is still far from contention, and Crosby is approaching the heart of his prime.\n\nAny Crosby trade would come at a steep cost — both in draft capital and money.\n\nIf Detroit were to acquire him, Crosby would carry a 2026 cap hit north of $30 million, though he does come with four years of team control after signing a three-year, $106.5 million extension last offseason.\n\nThat number is significant, but for a franchise pushing for its first Super Bowl appearance, it’s the type of financial swing that front offices sometimes decide is worth it.\n\nStatistically, Crosby is exactly what Detroit would be buying:\n\nProven durability and leadership\n\nThe Lions already have their defensive cornerstone in Hutchinson. What they don’t yet have is the elite second edge rusher who forces quarterbacks to pick their poison.\n\nThat’s why the Crosby rumors won’t die anytime soon.\n\nWhether Detroit actually pulls the trigger is another question — but according to ESPN, the Lions are very much in the mix.\n\nThe post NFL Insider Links Detroit Lions to Maxx Crosby appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "Daniel Kolcun didn't hesitate — the day after he was let go from his job, he founded his company Gridiron Football Prep, and got to work.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Daniel Kolcun, owner of Gridiron Football Prep. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI got let go from my job in 2021 as part of a companywide reduction.\n\nAt the time, I had been working in football product management at Wilson Sporting Goods, overseeing football products and working with teams, factories, and leather suppliers across college and professional football.\n\nWherever I went, the same topic of discussion came up: What's the best way to break in a football?\n\nI had been preparing footballs for years as an add-on service within my role for select teams.\n\nDuring COVID, that service expanded when equipment managers didn't have access to their facilities; they would ask for help, and I'd stay late, come in on weekends, or use downtime to prep footballs so they were ready to use.\n\nOver time, I learned how leather behaves in different weather, which products hold up, how to customize prep options to meet quarterbacks' needs, and which processes are duplicative.\n\nAfter the layoff, I had teams who were interested in continuing to work with me. So the day after I was let go, I started an LLC for my company, Gridiron Football Prep.\n\nI run Gridiron Football Prep out of my home in New Jersey with my wife, Emily, who handles product development and business operations. The workload is intense. At any given time, there can be hundreds of footballs in different stages of preparation — brushed, conditioned, balmed, mudded, and drying.\n\nWhen a football leaves the factory, it's missing key elements that prevent it from performing at the highest level. Quarterbacks may find it too slick, too stiff, or inconsistent in moisture, which can affect how the ball feels in their hands. Prepping a football to a quarterback's specific needs, so it feels more worn, tacky, soft, and usable in addition to performing better in different weather conditions.\n\nEvery football goes through a custom, multi-step process. There's brushing to open the leather's pores, conditioning to soften it, balming to add controlled tack, heat to bake products into the leather, and mudding to even the surface and help with moisture management.\n\nThe mud I use comes from New Jersey. I apply it by hand, so it spreads evenly across the leather and acts as an emulsifier, bringing the ball's natural tack to the surface. It also helps manage moisture and gives the football a more consistent color and feel.\n\nThe hands-on work averages at least 30 minutes per ball, but drying time stretches a full batch to about 72 hours. During peak season, I aim to finish roughly 50 footballs a day.\n\nOrders vary. Some college programs send 150 to 200 footballs before a season. Professional teams can go through hundreds over the course of a year. My pricing typically ranges from about $40 to $75 per ball, depending on volume, customization, and turnaround time.\n\nThe goal is simple: I don't want the quarterback thinking about the ball. If they're thinking about grip, something went wrong.\n\nFootball has been a part of my life for decades. I played the sport through high school and college, then stayed in the space through equipment work and product development roles over the years.\n\nI still watch football like a former player, but now I see it through a different lens — one shaped by deadlines, weather forecasts, and preparation cycles. Most of the time, the work I do doesn't show up on screen because that means the football is performing the way it's supposed to.\n\nThen there's the occasional snap where it matters. That might only be 1%. But sometimes, that 1% is enough to justify building a business around it.\n\nI never made it to the NFL as a player, but this is how I contribute to the game now.",

I think that’s outrageous still,” Kittle said. “If you get hit in the head … I don’t think that should be a thing unless you get hit helmet-to-helmet on a quarterback. If a (defensive lineman) is swiping to hit a ball and you accidentally hit the quarterback in the head that shouldn’t be a 15-yard penalty.

The division foes played each other three times this season.\n\n“Their defense reminds me of the defense I had in 2019,” Kittle said. “They come off the ball, they hit you in the face really, really hard. They penetrate against the line of scrimmage; your offensive line is always in the backfield and their DBs take advantage of that.

    "fullText": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Raiders star pass rusher Maxx Crosby said Friday any talk of wanting out of Las Vegas did not come from him.\n\nOne NFL reporter said this week he expected Crosby to be traded because the seven-year veteran didn't want to go through another rebuild. Another NFL reporter said Crosby was especially interested in playing for New England coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nSpeaking from the team facility, Crosby said Friday on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” that he intentionally hasn't spoken publicly this offseason because he learned he “can't control everything.”\n\n“Now that I'm quiet, I've got random people making big statements for me,” said Crosby, wearing a Raiders sweatshirt and skull cap. \"They're like, ‘Maxx must’ve told them this.' For me, I just sit back and laugh because I know my truth and when I go to bed at night, I have a smile on my face because I don't have to explain nothing to nobody.\n\n“I'm getting healthy. I'm in the building every single day. I'm in this building from 6 a.m. when it's dark out, and I'm here until almost 2. ... That's all I care about, so all the noise, that's news to me sometimes.\"\n\nSpeculation about Crosby's future with the Raiders ramped up late last season when the club placed him on injured reserve with two games left because of a knee injury. Crosby was not pleased about the decision and left the building.\n\nThe five-time Pro Bowler could attract a strong trade offer if the Raiders go that route. They are about to enter their third season in a row with a different head coach, with Seattle offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak expected to take the job after Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nLas Vegas comes off a 3-14 record, but will have the first pick in the draft and more than $91 million in salary cap space, according to overthecap.com.\n\nCrosby has had double-digit sacks three of the past four years, and this season had a career-high 28 tackles for loss.\n\nHe said his focus is on rehabilitating from left knee surgery that took place about a month ago.\n\n“I'm ahead of schedule, and it's business as usual,” Crosby said. “It's my eighth surgery in seven years. It's something that I've gotten used to. It's all about perspective, about how you approach what you want to accomplish. I'm willing to run that marathon.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza insists his focus remains squarely on the NFL Draft process. But the projected No. 1 overall pick and Heisman Trophy winner revealed a bit of his future during a TV interview Friday.\n\nWhile on The Pat McAfee Show, the former Indiana quarterback detailed the offensive systems he has studied in preparation for the next level. In doing so, Mendoza went out of his way to praise Klint Kubiak and the structure of the scheme associated with his coaching tree.\n\n“We actually had a little bit of a Kubiak, kind of McVay system,” Mendoza said, citing his familiarity with outside zone runs, play action concepts and bootlegs. He also pointed to Kubiak’s work with quarterbacks, including the recent development of Sam Darnold, as particularly impressive.\n\nThe breakdown also shows Mendoza is way beyond his years in terms of football IQ. He's able to recognize parts of the game other signal callers tend to gloss over at his age. He noted he was following Kubiak’s offensive breakdowns well before reports linked him to the head coaching vacancy with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nFernando Mendoza says on @TheHerd that he was a huge fan of Tom Brady growing up:\n\n“I read the TB12 book. I was always big on preparation. Because, like Tom, I’m not the biggest, I’m not the fastest, I’m not the strongest. But the edge is in the intellect and preparation.” https://t.co/4VogMUSIaJpic.twitter.com/28IDsgpH2m\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) February 6, 2026\n\nAs examples of how the right structure can accelerate a rebuild, Mendoza referenced the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, franchises he said quickly shifted from the margins to championship contention.\n\nIndiana's Heisman also spoke highly about Tom Brady, who is now a minority owner with the Raiders. Mendoza told Colin Cowherd that Brady’s preparation and discipline resonated deeply with him, particularly given his own lightly recruited background.\n\nMore: Bill Belichick's girlfriend heats up Tom Brady reunion talk\n\nWith Las Vegas holding the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and widely expected to target Mendoza, the connections are difficult to overlook.\n\nWhile he maintains that development remains his priority, Mendoza’s comments suggested a quarterback already envisioning the right fit and perhaps the right franchise for his NFL future.\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nJimmy Kimmel roasts Bill Belichick’s girlfriend over Hall of Fame debate\n\nEx-Indiana QB fires back after portrayal in CBS 60 Minutes interview\n\nSkip Holtz provides update on his father's condition\n\nJason Whitlock slams Shedeur Sanders says 'NFL's Jake Paul' didn't earn Pro Bowl",

We're hearing from cities all over the world that want to host these games and they really want to get more American football.\"\n\nGoodell has mentioned venturing into Asia while Abu Dhabi is one of the cities where the NFL has conducted a site visit to examine the possibility of playing a game there.\n\nThis week he reiterated that his ultimate goal is to play 16 international games each season, meaning each of the NFL's 32 teams would play overseas once a year.\n\n\"I think that's an important mark for us to go for, and I think we're well on our way,\" Goodell added.\n\nMini Super Bowls & Christmas games - NFL's bid to become 'truly global'\n\nTwo west coast teams were expected to make the journey for the NFL's first game in Australia, to minimise the impact of travel.\n\nAnd the Rams have been handed an encounter with divisional rivals the 49ers, who have also been regular Super Bowl contenders in recent years, so it makes for an appealing match-up.\n\nAfter being named this season's Most Valuable Player in San Francisco on Thursday, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford said: \"It seems like a long flight, and I hope my back's not too sore afterwards, to be honest with you.\n\n\"But I am excited about it, it's a really cool opportunity. Playing an unbelievable team like the 49ers is going to be a huge challenge. It's a fun rivalry so I think the fans in Australia are going to get a great game.\"\n\nDavid White, interim executive director of the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA) said this week: \"Our members appreciate the global stage. They understand the excitement that the games are generating around the world.\n\n\"But we've got a lot of feedback about not having good experiences because it's inconsistent. It's a seemingly arbitrary approach that clubs take to travel.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nBefore this season's game at Wembley, for example, the Jacksonville Jaguars flew out to London early in the week, while the Rams arrived the day before the game and returned to LA immediately after their 35-7 win.\n\n\"Some teams will stay near the practice site, some will have lengthy commutes for the players after that travel, when they're getting over jet leg,\" said White. \"It depends which team they play for, so it's the lack of standardisation that feels arbitrary.\n\n\"The game requires a certain amount of rest, preparation and restoration in order for players to be safe, so all of that needs to be accounted for if we're going to talk about [travelling] even further away or having more international games. That's a matter of negotiation.\"\n\nThe NFL's current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the NFLPA allows up to 10 regular-season games to held overseas per season.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings became the first team to have two international games in the same season in 2025, playing in Dublin and London on successive Sundays, and linebacker Jonathan Greenard said he \"would not like to do back-to-back [again]\".\n\nBut White said players gave a \"good deal of positive feedback because of the way they went about it. That is the trick.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is possible that 16 games worldwide gets to be too much, but that's for the players to decide once they have all the information.\n\n\"We do have some sense of what makes a positive experience when travelling internationally, and we're collecting data.\n\n\"It's about making sure that the players are at the centre of that debate.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

The Patriots have a chance to pass them this weekend, however, if they’re able to upset the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAccordingly, it figures that either Pittsburgh or New England would have had the best play in Super Bowl history, which legendary broadcaster Al Michaels revealed this week during his appearance on the “Fitz And Whit” podcast.\n\nAl Michaels on James Harrison’s Super Bowl Pick six:\n\n\"You've got James Harrison what, for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history.”#steelers\n\nFitz and Whit pic.twitter.com/MIW81OEahF\n\n— Matthew Luciow (@matthewluciow92) February 5, 2026\n\nMichaels discussed the Steelers’ exciting 27-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII, which featured a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown by Pittsburgh linebacker James Harrison off Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. The play set a Super Bowl record and gave the Steelers a 10-point lead heading into halftime.\n\n“You’ve got James Harrison with, what for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history. A hundred-yard interception return at the end of the half. Crazy, down the sideline, he’s almost getting tackled 15 times,” recalled Michaels, who called the game for NBC.\n\nEven though the play happened 17 years ago, Michaels still remembers it like it was yesterday. So do many Pittsburgh fans, as their team hasn’t won a Super Bowl since.\n\nMore Steelers: Steelers Reportedly Expected To Hire New Outside Linebackers Coach\n\nThe post Al Michaels Claims Steelers Had ‘Greatest Play In Super Bowl History’ appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "Why Justin Herbert's first-place MVP vote is odd twist to Matthew Stafford victory over Drake Maye originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL was very close to having co-league MVP quarterbacks for the second time ever and first time in 22 years. Instead, the Rams' Matthew Stafford's margin of victory -- one first-place vote -- over the Patriots' Drake Maye (24-23) will go down as the closest decision in league history.\n\nNot since the Colts' Peyton Manning and the late Titans great Steve McNair tied 16-16 and shared MVP in 2003 has there been such a narrow call. Stafford edging Maye was the most expected result at Thursday's Associated Press NFL Honors ceremony, but it still came with controversy considering where the three other first-place votes went.\n\nWhile 47 of the 50 AP voters, which includes national beat reporters and television analysts such as Tom Brady, had a natural split between Stafford and Maye -- much like Josh Allen beating Lamar Jackson for 2024 MVP -- three went in a different direction. Two voters thought Allen should repeat and gave him a follow-up first-place love. But one inexplicably threw away their most valuable vote on Justin Herbert.\n\nMORE:How Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye in closest race since 2003\n\nThere was some logic to Allen's season with the Bills being worthy of some recognition, given it was more efficient than his winning year in many ways. But Herbert's year with the Chargers shouldn't have had a real case.\n\nHerbert wasn't even one of the five finalists \"nominated\" at the 2026 NFL Honors. Stafford, Maye and Allen were joined by Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence and 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who both didn't get any first place votes.\n\nBefore the AP reveals on Friday how all 50 voters ranked their top five from first to fifth, the Herbert voter outed himself -- it was former Pro Football Focus analyst Sam Monson.\n\nI was the Justin Herbert vote.\n\nThe guy had the worst offensive line in the NFL all season and despite that he was working miracles in almost every single game.\n\nStafford's OL became 2/5ths as bad as Herbert's for 5 minutes and he became a turnover howitzer.\n\nHe embodied 'value'.\n\n— Sam Monson (@SamMonsonNFL) February 6, 2026\n\nHerbert did have to deal with a broken-down offensive line with both top offensive tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt going down with season-ending injuries. He was sacked 54 times and the Chargers gave up 60 as a team.\n\nBut Maye also was sacked a ton, 47 times, with his rookie left tackle Will Campbell battling inexperience and injury. Maye led the league in completion percentage (72.0), yards per pass attempt (8.9) and passer rating (113.5). He also rushed for 450 yards.\n\nStafford led the league with his 4,709 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes while averaging 7.9 yards per attempt and rating 109.2.\n\nHerbert's numbers weren't close to either. He averaged 7.3 yards per attempt and rated 94.1. He threw for only 26 TDs with 13 interceptions while passing for fewer than 4,000 yards (3,727 yards). Those kind of mediocre numbers lack both efficiency and profilic nature, two things that count most in the history of the award, with MVP really being \"the best quarterback in the league award\".\n\nMORE:Matthew Stafford says he’s not retiring in 2026 NFL MVP Speech\n\nEvery quarterback that wins MVP has a favorable support system. Herbert might have been let down by his team, but in the end, MVP is an award for individual performance. Had Herbert put up transcendent numbers with those challenges, it's one thing. But one cannot blame Stafford or Maye for having better all-around support systems and taking full advantage.\n\nHerbert didn't deserve that vote, or even a fifth-place one.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Honors celebrated the defining performances and stories of the 2025 season, recognizing excellence that went far beyond the box score. From veteran stars reaching new heights to emerging talents announcing their arrival, this year’s winners reflected the league’s unique blend of longevity, resilience, and evolution. Together, these awards capture the moments and individuals who shaped the NFL’s narrative over the past season.\n\nMatthew Stafford captured his first NFL MVP award after a remarkable 17th season in the league. He led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes. His performance was a career-high and pivotal in the Rams’ offensive success, showcasing both precision and longevity at age 37. Stafford’s journey from years of underappreciated play in Detroit to peak form in Los Angeles adds a compelling arc to his MVP narrative. Despite his veteran status, he announced intentions to continue playing, hinting at even more chapters ahead.\n\nSmith-Njigba emerged as the league’s top offensive weapon, setting franchise records and finishing with 1,793 receiving yards — the most in the NFL for the 2025 season. His route running, consistency, and ability to create separation made him a matchup nightmare for defenses. He became the focal point of Seattle’s attack and proved he’s more than just a deep threat, becoming a true WR1. His production helped elevate the Seahawks into serious playoff contention.\n\nMyles Garrett’s season will go down in history — he shattered the NFL single-season sack record with 23 and logged 33 tackles for loss. His relentless pass rush and ability to disrupt games earned him Defensive Player of the Year honors for a second time. Garrett’s dominance, even when facing constant double teams, illustrated his evolution into one of the truly elite defenders in the league. His impact extended beyond sacks, as he altered offensive game plans weekly.\n\nMcMillan made an immediate splash in his rookie season, leading all first-year players in receiving and showcasing a polished route tree and natural ball skills. His chemistry with his quarterback and knack for big plays gave the Panthers a reliable and explosive weapon. The award signals the start of a potentially incredible NFL career, with McMillan already displaying pro-caliber instincts. His performance brought excitement to Carolina’s offense and optimism for the future.\n\nSchwesinger arrived as a surprise standout, amassing impressive tackle totals and impact plays that anchored the Browns’ defense. His instincts in coverage and physicality in run support distinguished him from his draft class peers. Winning Defensive Rookie of the Year validated his immediate contribution and hinted at future stardom. His emergence added a dynamic element to Cleveland’s defense.\n\nThuney’s performance as an interior offensive lineman earned him the inaugural Protector of the Year award, emphasizing his role in stabilizing the Bears’ offensive front. His pass protection and run-blocking prowess helped elevate Chicago’s offensive efficiency. Known for his intelligence and technique, Thuney became a leader on the line. This award recognizes the importance of unsung linemen who anchor offensive success.\n\nMcCaffrey’s journey back from significant injury was one of the most impressive stories of the season, finishing with over 2,100 scrimmage yards and 17 touchdowns. His versatility — as a runner, receiver, and team leader — made him indispensable to the 49ers’ offense. The award honors not just statistical excellence but resilience and dedication to rehabilitation. His triumphant return energized teammates and fans alike.\n\nVrabel guided the Patriots through a successful turnaround, leading them to an AFC East title and deep playoff push on his first year with the team. His leadership and game management earned recognition as Coach of the Year by his peers. Vrabel’s emphasis on culture and discipline translated into tangible improvement on the field. The award underscores his impact in transforming the Patriots into a contender.\n\nMcDaniels’ role as Assistant Coach of the Year reflects his influence in shaping the Patriots’ offensive identity and maximizing the talent on the roster. Known for his strategic approach and game-planning acumen, McDaniels helped elevate New England’s execution. His contributions were integral to the team’s success and competitive positioning.\n\nWagner was honored for his exceptional leadership on the field and impactful community service off it. The Walter Payton Man of the Year Award recognizes players who demonstrate commitment to their communities, and Wagner’s efforts have extended well beyond football. His charitable initiatives and mentorship work set a standard for NFL players. The award celebrates character and civic contribution.\n\nTaken as a whole, the complete list of 2026 NFL Honors winners tells the story of a season driven by elite play, leadership, and perseverance. Each awardee left a distinct imprint on their team and, in many cases, the broader direction of the league. As the NFL turns the page to a new season, these honorees stand as benchmarks for excellence and reminders of how special the 2025 campaign truly was.\n\nThe post Complete list of winners in 2026 NFL Honors appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "New court filing sheds considerable light on Gruden's four-year-old civil action.",
    "fullText": "Former Buccaneers and Raiders coach Jon Gruden's lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell continues. And, as Gruden sees it, the potential financial damages will be very significant.\n\nIn a Case Conference Report filed on Wednesday, February 5, Gruden's lawyers revealed that his losses \"total well over $150,000,000.\" The damages flow from, per the Case Conference Report, \"loss of his employment, interference with future employment opportunities, loss of contract value, loss of sponsorships, reputational damage, costs, expert fees, and attorney fees incurred as a result of this dispute.\"\n\nGruden filed the lawsuit roughly a month after his forced resignation from the Raiders, following reports from the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times containing emails Gruden had sent and received while employed by ESPN. Those emails had been harvested as part of an investigation regarding the Washington Commanders and former owner Daniel Snyder. Gruden contends that the emails were leaked with the specific goal of prompting the termination of his employment.\n\nThe Case Conference Report was prepared following an \"early case conference\" in which the NFL declined to participate. The league, we're told, contends that discovery in the case has been stayed pending the appeal of a denial of a motion to dismiss under the Nevada anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nIn the Case Conference Report, a copy of which PFT has obtained and reviewed, Gruden's lawyers list in the form of mandatory disclosures the potential witnesses in the case. They include: Goodell, various attorneys from the Paul Weiss law firm, former NFL general counsel Jeff Pash, chief NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, Snyder, former Raiders general counsel Dan Ventrelle, Raiders owner Mark Davis, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, attorney Beth Wilkinson, various attorneys from the Reed Smith firm, Desiree Perez of Roc Nation, former NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith, and Gruden.\n\nThe Case Conference Report does not expressly indicate that any, some, or all of these individuals listed will be deposed by Gruden's lawyers, and it does not mention any current attempts to compel their deposition testimony.\n\nThe Case Conference Report lists several specific NFL teams that have potentially relevant information: the Commanders, Raiders, Cowboys, Patriots, Seahawks, Giants, Jets, and Dolphins. It does not identify any of the reporters from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.\n\nIn a separate portion of the Case Conference Report, Gruden's lawyers list various documents that they contend the NFL should disclose \"immediately.\" The documents include all 650,000 documents generated during Wilkinson's investigation of the Commanders and a so-called \"'Blackmail Powerpoint' presented by Daniel Snyder and/or Reed Smith to the NFL Defendants, containing communications by Roger Goodell and Jeff Pash.\"\n\nThe Case Conference Report also states that no settlement discussions have occurred.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the NFL has filed, or plans to file, a petition for appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the question of whether Gruden should be required to pursue his claims through arbitration controlled by the NFL.\n\nThe case has been pending for more than four years, due mainly to the preliminary skirmishes regarding the arbitration question. At some point, depositions will occur and documents will be obtained — unless the case is dismissed or settled.",

There was the usual “wrong cue on the teleprompter” gag right before the nominees were announced, and then Druski announced JSN as the winner.\n\nThis isn’t like Cher thinking Luther Vandross won a Grammy from beyond the grave, this was Druski seemingly trying to mispronounce Smith-Njigba’s surname for comedic effect/hoping it goes viral.\n\nDruski mispronounced Jaxon Smith-Njigba's name on purpose, right?\n\nThis was worse than Mike Verbal pic.twitter.com/ZBBMDDHscP\n\n— Ben Brown 🌻 (@BenBrownPL) February 6, 2026\n\nFor those who don’t know Druski either from social media or the T-Mobile commercials, he is a big sports fan and actually aspired to be a sportscaster before turning to comedy. My suspicion is that he 100 percent knew how to pronounce Smith-Njigba’s name and could’ve just said “JSN” from the get-go if he wanted to.\n\nUchenna Nwosu and the Seahawks PR team took Druski to task on this one.\n\n— Uchenna Nwosu (@UchennaN_42) February 6, 2026\n\nHall of Famer Barry Sanders drew the short straw getting stuck with @druski’s big whiff tonight.

    "fullText": "In 2026, the Dallas Cowboys will be among the teams taking part in the NFL's international games.\n\nWith the thought that the Cowboys could head down under to Australia and even to Mexico after Jerry Jones made it clear he would be interested in such a move, Dallas now knows where it will be heading in 2026.\n\nIt will be the first time the Cowboys have played an international game since 2014, and coach Brian Schottenheimer's team is off to Rio de Janeiro in 2026.\n\nWe don't know who their opponents will be, but it will no doubt be a huge draw given the Cowboys are involved.\n\nAfter a failed 2025 season, the Cowboys will now look towards the 2026 season as one where they can mount a bounce-back and make the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.\n\nAnd playing in Brazil will certainly have its perks.\n\nMost of all, the marketing side, which we know Jerry and the Cowboys will eat up.\n\nSchottenheimer will lead his Cowboys to a place they've never played an NFL game before, nor the NFL, as Maracanã Stadium will host the game, with the previous outings in Brazil being played in São Paulo, so it will be another career first for the head coach.\n\nWhat is rather interesting about the Cowboys playing in Brazil is that, as we understand it, it will be a home game at AT&T Stadium, and so the franchise is giving up the revenue that goes with that.\n\nBut of course, there are riches to be mined internationally, too.\n\nReportedly, the Cowboys' potential opponents for the game are the Buccaneers, Titans, Jaguars, Niners, Cardinals, and Ravens.\n\nThat is, providing the NFL doesn't make it an NFC East showdown, which does seem highly unlikely, but you never know in the NFL.\n\nSo there will be a lot to monitor over the coming weeks and months, as the Cowboys go international for the first time in over a decade, with Schottenheimer's new-look Dallas team leading the way.\n\nThe Ravens loom as a good opponent for the Cowboys, as do the 49ers, but they are already heading to Australia to face the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nEither way, the Cowboys are going to be part of the international series, and that's exciting.",

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL in the British amateur game with the London Warriors.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",
