    "fullText": "The NFL is heading back to Munich. After playing games in the German city in both 2022 and 2024, the NFL announced Wednesday it will return to Munich in both 2026 and 2028 for regular-season games.\n\nThe move is part of a multiyear partnership with both the city of Munich and FC Bayern Munich. Games will be hosted at Allianz Arena, where FC Bayern Munich plays its home games.\n\nThe NFL today announced it will return to Munich, Germany in 2026 and 2028 to play regular season games, as part of a multi-year partnership with the City of Munich and FC Bayern Munich.\n\nThe games will be played at the FC Bayern Munich Stadium.\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 10, 2025\n\nFC Bayern Munich confirmed the partnership, with the mayor of Munich, Verena Dietl, expressing excitement over \"spreading the enthusiasm\" for American football in the city.\n\n\"I’m delighted about the extension of our contract with the NFL and it once again shows the importance and strength of Munich as a sporting city. The previous games not only won the hearts of the fans, but also strengthened our successful cooperation with the NFL. Together, we’re committed to promoting American football in Germany and spreading the enthusiasm for the sport far beyond the stadiums. I'm looking forward to the upcoming games in 2026 and 2028, which will not only bring top-class sport, but also valuable impetus for grassroots sport in our city.\"\n\nThe NFL has played regular-season games in Munich two other times. The Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers played at Allianz Arena in 2022, with the Bucs coming out on top. Two years later, the Carolina Panthers beat the New York Giants in Munich.\n\nGermany is no stranger to hosting NFL games at this point. In addition to those two contests, the Indianapolis Colts and Atlanta Falcons played a regular season game in Berlin, Germany earlier this year. The Colts won thanks to a tremendous performance from running back Jonathan Taylor.\n\nThe NFL has not announced which teams will take part in the Munich game in 2026 or 2028.\n\nIn recent years, the NFL has pushed to expand play outside the United States. The league has scheduled a number of international games each year, with six taking place during the 2025 NFL season. The NFL has played at least one game in the United Kingdom regularly since the 2007 season and has expanded international play to Brazil, Spain and Mexico, among other countries, in recent seasons.\n\nThe 2026 Munich game marks one of six international games announced by the NFL for next season. In addition to playing in Germany next year, the NFL will also play in Australia, Brazil and Mexico. The league will also play two games in the United Kingdom in 2026.\n\nThe league announced the Los Angeles Rams will play in the Australia game and that the Jacksonville Jaguars will appear in one of the games in the United Kingdom, but have not revealed any other teams taking part in international games next season.",

    "description": "We’re back in the top 10 baybeee",
    "fullText": "As Week 15 approaches, we rounded up the latest NFL power rankings to get a sense of how the Jaguars are viewed nationally.\n\nTrevor Lawrence has taken major strides the past two weeks. It’s all starting to click in the new offense.\n\nThey played once at Levi’s Stadium this year. Could they be returning?\n\nMost shocking statistical ranking: Wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr . is 50th in receiving yards\n\nExpectations were pretty high for Thomas after a big rookie season — 1,282 yards (third in the NFL) and 10 TDs — but he has had issues catching the ball (five drops) and rookie Travis Hunter moved ahead of Thomas into the No. 1 receiver role by Week 7 before Hunter ‘s season-ending injury. Thomas did miss three games because of an ankle injury and has had five catches for 115 yards in the two games since his return. But the team now views Jakobi Meyers — whom they traded for on Nov. 4 — as its No. 1 wideout. Thomas has 535 receiving yards so far.\n\nThey’re holding steady at No. 9 − and now firmly atop the AFC South with fifth-year QB Trevor Lawrence playing his most efficient football of the season heading into the stretch drive.\n\nNothing about Jacksonville’s successful season has felt intentional, let alone sustainable, but I think that the Jaguars are turning the corner. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has finally found a good rhythm in the passing game, his receivers are catching the ball again, and the playoff picture is shaping up for the Jags to win a game or two this postseason.\n\nAfter saying all that, I’m positive that this team will repay my belief by embarrassing itself in the next couple of weeks.\n\nBeating the Colts was huge and probably wrapped up the AFC South for them. Still, it’s hard not to wonder how the game would’ve played out if Indy hadn’t lost QB Daniel Jones.\n\nIf you were to ask me to identify Jacksonville’s superpower, I’d probably stumble my way through an answer before mentioning the run defense. But once Daniel Jones was knocked out of Sunday’s game, the Jaguars flexed their muscles and put the Colts away to wrest temporary control of the division. The Texans are coming, but these Jaguars are making things work in Liam Coen’s first season. He might be running third in the Coach of the Year race behind Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson, but Coen’s offense looked nice early against Indy before slowing down after halftime. All in all, though, this team is playing good football at the right time. Jacksonville has allowed just 13 points per game over the past four, and it’s looking like the Jags could face undrafted rookie Brady Cook at QB when the Jets come to town this Sunday.\n\nThe Jaguars took control of the NFC South on Sunday, and there’s a good chance they secure their first division title since 2022 by winning three of their final four games.\n\nWith Daniel Jones injured for Indianapolis, the Denver Broncos are probably the only playoff-caliber challenge left on Jacksonville’s schedule. If the Jags don’t play down to the competition against the Colts, Jets and Titans, they’ll host a playoff game.\n\nHow Jacksonville actually fares in the postseason will hinge on Trevor Lawrence’s play and the defense’s ability to force turnovers. The Jaguars haven’t won the turnover battle and lost a game since Week 2.\n\nAs wrong as I was about how Ben Johnson’s demeanor was going to translate to leading an NFL locker room, I may have been equally wrong about Liam Coen. Just look at the immaculate vibes taking place here.\n\nSunday changed everything in the AFC South. The Colts lost Daniel Jones, and the Jaguars picked up a critical win. It’s hard to watch the Jaguars and Texans and believe Jacksonville is the better team right now (more on the Texans in a bit) but they do lead the division. The AFC South might come down to whether the Jaguars can beat the Broncos or the Texans can beat the Chargers, because the other remaining games for both teams are all winnable.\n\nFrom Josh Kendall and Chad Graff:\n\nThe Jaguars’ first-year coach is in a neck-and-neck race with the Bears’ Ben Johnson for the most performative postgame locker room speeches. After Jacksonville won for the fifth time in six games Sunday, Coen looked on the verge of breaking his players’ hands high-fiving. He has the players believing, though. Josh Hines-Allen was even talking about the Super Bowl after recording his seventh sack.\n\nThe Jaguars’ average rank this week is 9.6 (last week: 11.2).\n\nThe #Jaguars keep on climbing pic.twitter.com/mJqYwcOuw0\n\n— Duval 22 (@duval22dotcom) December 10, 2025\n\nWhere would you rank the team, Jaguars fans? Let us know in the comments!",

    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",
