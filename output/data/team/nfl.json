    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals will almost certainly, once again, be on the lookout for help in the defensive secondary.\n\nDon’t be surprised if the Bengals take yet another stab at finding a cornerstone cornerback in the draft after a number of misses in recent years.\n\nA recent mock draft from Sports Illustrated’s Daniel Flick has the Bengals tapping into Joe Burrow’s alma mater of LSU to grab cornerback Mansoor Delane.\n\nThe Bengals have the NFL’s worst defense, ranking last in total yards, scoring and rushing yards allowed and No. 29 in passing yards allowed. Delane is the draft’s best cornerback, and his elite instincts and route anticipation enable him to thrive in both man and zone coverages. The 6' 0\", 190-pound Delane has above-average ball skills, with two interceptions and 11 pass breakups this season, and is a physical, willing tackler in run support. He’s the complete package and should start as a rookie.\n\nDelane was a unanimous All-American and First-Team All-SEC in 2025. He recorded 45 tackles and two interceptions this season and just recently officially declared for the draft.\n\nThe Bengals have DJ Turner and Dax Hill as long-term options. But the Cam Taylor-Britt experiment is over and the search for higher-end prospects will start once again.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bengals Wire: Bengals won't make fans happy in top 10 NFL mock draft",

    "fullText": "This might be the most top-heavy season in recent NFL memory. Following Sunday's games in Week 16, there are now eight teams within one game of having the league's best record, and the San Francisco 49ers could make it nine by Monday night's end. The two teams sitting atop last week's rankings both lost, with the Denver Broncos losing by 14 points at home after standing alone as the best record.\n\nThings are shaping up for an incredible playoff season and with two weeks remaining, seeds are more up for grabs than ever. Meanwhile, if the top if heavy, the bottom is as well. There are seven teams with four wins or fewer, stinking up the joint each and every week. The battle for the No. 1 draft pick is just as intense as that for the No. 1 seeds.

    "fullText": "It's the penultimate week on the regular-season calendar, and we get a Thursday tripleheader for Christmas Day as a holiday treat.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys open proceedings at the Washington Commanders as 5.5-point road favorites before the Detroit Lions travel to Minneapolis to face the Minnesota Vikings (+5.5).\n\nThursday Night Football on Christmas Day sure looked like a marquee matchup before the season started, but the Patrick Mahomes-less Kansas City Chiefs are 13.5-point home underdogs to the Denver Broncos.\n\nThere are some big-time clashes on the weekend, though, with the Houston Texans and Los Angeles Chargers (-1.5) meeting on Saturday and the Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills (-2.5) and Chicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers (-2.5) headline Sunday's action.\n\nLet's look at all the latest Week 17 odds.\n\nView full Cowboys vs. Commanders odds and matchup\n\nRead our Cowboys vs. Commanders picks and predictions (coming soon)\n\nThe Cowboys opened as 5.5-point road favorites for this Christmas Day game. Washington QB Marcus Mariota is day-to-day with a hand injury on the short week. This total hit the board at 49.5 points and jumped to 50.5 with early play on the Over.\n\nAlso see: full Thursday Night Football odds\n\nView full Lions vs. Vikings odds and matchup\n\nRead our Lions vs. Vikings picks and predictions (coming soon)\n\nMinnesota could be without QB1 J.J. McCarthy on Xmas after he left Week 16 with a hand injury. Although his X-rays came back negative, he was unable to grip a football. The Lions are backed against a wall after fumbling a Week 16 home game and need to win out – and get help on the weekend – to make the playoffs. Detroit opened as a 5.5-point road favorite, and some books are already up to -6. The total opened at 46.5 and dropped to 44.5 with one-sided play on the Under out of the gate.\n\nView full Broncos vs. Chiefs odds and matchup\n\nRead our Broncos vs. Chiefs picks and predictions (coming soon)\n\nThe quarterback situation in Kansas City went from bad to worse. Patrick Mahomes’ replacement, Gardner Minshew, suffered a torn ACL in Week 16, leaving the Chiefs offense in the hands of QB3 Chris Oladokun. The Broncos are trying to get right after a home loss to Jacksonville and opened as 10.5-point road chalk, quickly climbing as high as -13.5 for this Christmas Day game. The Over/Under opened at 36.5 and is up to 37.5.\n\nView full Texans vs. Chargers odds and matchup\n\nRead our Texans vs. Chargers picks and predictions (coming soon)\n\nThis is a big battle in the AFC pecking order with Los Angeles opening as a 1.5-point home underdog to Houston and jumping the fence to -1.5 with early opinion on the host Bolts. The total hit the board at 41.5 points, and with two of the top defenses in the NFL butting heads, Under money flooded the market and moved this through the key number of 41 to 39.5 O/U.\n\nView full Ravens vs. Packers odds and matchup\n\nRead our Ravens vs. Packers picks and predictions (coming soon)\n\nThis non-conference contest was supposed to be a marquee matchup in Week 17, but injuries to the two quarterbacks took a lot of star power off the board. Jordan Love (concussion) and Lamar Jackson (back) have a short week to recover for this Saturday kickoff. The Packers opened as 2.5-point home favorites while the total originated at 41.5 O/U. FYI: Also keep an eye on the health of Green Bay backup QB Malik Willis, who is dealing with a shoulder injury.\n\nView full Cardinals vs. Bengals odds and matchup\n\nRead our Cardinals vs. Bengals picks and predictions (coming soon)\n\n“Fun” might be the only thing to play for when the Bengals host the Cardinals in Week 17. Joe Burrow enjoyed himself with a one-sided win over Miami in Week 16, and bookies opened Cincinnati as a 6.5-point favorite, with that jumping to a touchdown spread. The total hit the board at 51.5 points, but with two pass-happy offenses and two terrible pass defenses, this number has soared to 53.5 in the first 12 hours of action.\n\nView full Seahawks vs. Panthers odds and matchup\n\nRead our Seahawks vs. Panthers picks and predictions (coming soon)\n\nThe Seahawks are trying to hold onto the top seed in the NFC while the Panthers are fighting to stay ahead of the Bucs in the NFC South.

Pittsburgh opened as a 5.5-point road chalk, but with star WR DK Metcalf likely facing a suspension after an altercation with a fan, this spread dropped to -4.5. The total hit the board at 35.5 points and slimmed to 34.5 O/U – currently tied for the second-lowest Over/Under of the 2025 season.\n\nView full Saints vs. Titans odds and matchup\n\nRead our Saints vs. Titans picks and predictions (coming soon)\n\nThe Saints opened as 2.5-point road favorites in Nashville and have jumped to field-goal faves in Week 17, bringing with them a three-game winning streak.

    "description": "At 8-6, the Colts are on the outside looking in at the playoff picture, but 44-year-old Philip Rivers coming in off the couch is one of the great stories of this NFL season.",
    "fullText": "Just think, for a moment, how you’d look in a pair of form-fitting football pants and a tight-around-the-belly jersey. Would you look like a honed specimen of humanity, lean and taut and ready to explode? Or would you look like 10 pounds of sausage in a five-pound casing, busting the seams?\n\nIf you’re being honest, you, me, and pretty much everyone both of us knows would look a whole lot more like a sausage than a specimen. A whole lot like Philip Rivers does, honestly.\n\nBut the difference between Philip Rivers and us, of course, is that we aren’t starting at quarterback on Monday Night Football.\n\nRivers and the briefly-mighty, now-floundering Indianapolis Colts take on the San Francisco 49ers in a matchup that, from a sheer talent standpoint, looked a whole lot more attractive back in September than it does now. Ball-knowers will scoff at Rivers and wonder who in the world would want to watch a 44-year-old grandfather run around for three hours.\n\nTo which I would say: Everyone. Everyone would love to see that. Because what Rivers is doing is both awesome and ridiculous.\n\nIn any other career, Rivers would be hitting his prime at age 44, old enough to have learned the ropes but young enough to have the energy and desire to do more. In sports, though, he’s impossibly ancient, a relic who could burst into a pile of dust with one good sack. Hopefully he won’t, but that’s the line on most aged pro athletes.\n\nPlayers like Tom Brady and LeBron James have redefined the possible parameters of a late-career athlete, but then again, Tom Brady and LeBron James are arguably the GOATs of their respective sports. They played for such a high level for so long that their age-related decline merely brought them down to star level.\n\nRivers wasn’t ever in that stratosphere, though he had a few years in the mid-2000s — you know, about two decades ago — when he garnered some Pro Bowl nods and MVP votes. He ran with all the speed of the changing seasons, yes, but he also possessed two valuable attributes — an orbital-launch arm and a surpassing knowledge of potential defensive schemes.\n\nThat’s how he was able to come back and mesh with the Colts so quickly last week against Seattle. He played within himself, tossing a nifty 18 of 27 completions for 160 yards, with a long of just 17 yards. He had an adjusted yards gained per pass attempt of 3.52 — quite the falloff from the 8- to 9-yard average of his best days. Against San Francisco, he could fare even better; the 49ers trail Seattle in every major defensive category.\n\nBut stats are for nerds. What Grandpa Rivers did last week was ball, plain and simple. And now he’s getting a chance to take Indy on a last-ditch playoff run? Come on, how can you not love this?\n\nAt 8-6, Indianapolis sits in the dreaded first-team-out spot, well behind 10-5 division rival Houston for the final spot in the AFC playoffs. After this week, the Colts have games against the Texans and Jaguars, both teams they’re staring up at in the playoff bracket. The Athletic gives Indianapolis just a 3 percent chance of making the playoffs, which is a rough prognosis given the Colts’ 7-1 start to 2025.\n\nThat’s tough news for the franchise and the city, but on a micro level, a great story is unfolding. Rivers is the embodiment of every former football player — whether high school, college or just two-hand touch Turkey Bowl — who would love to get one more turn in the arena, one more play with the ball in their hands, one more chance to rear back and throw it deep. He’s living the dream that if you keep in shape, if you keep your edge — if not your waistline — then maybe, just maybe, they’ll call your number one more time. Father Time is undefeated, yes, but you can always move the ball against him if you want it badly enough.\n\nRivers’ return is a hell of a story, however it ends. But it’d be nice if he went out with at least one more victory. Why not a prime-time one?",

    "description": "Week 16 reshaped the NFL playoff picture. Here is where things stand ahead of Colts-49ers",
    "fullText": "Week 16 saw several teams clinch playoff spots, and changed the pecking order in both the NFC and the AFC.\n\nIn the NFC, we have a new team in the No. 1 spot, and just two playoff spots left up for grabs as five teams have now clinched.\n\nIn the AFC, the race for the No. 1 spot remains tight, as six teams remain alive in the chase for the bye week.\n\nHere is the full state of play in the NFC ahead of Monday Night Football:\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (10-5) – xy\n\nWashington Commanders (4-11) – e\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ny – Team has clinched their division\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nThanks to Sunday’s action, only two playoff spots are left up for grabs in the NFC.\n\nLet’s start at the top of the conference. Seattle’s huge overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams not only punched the Seahawks’ ticket for the playoffs, but it put them in the driver’s seat for the No. 1 seed in the conference. Seattle now controls their destiny in the chase for the top spot, as wins in their final two games (over Carolina and San Francisco) would give them the No. 1 seed.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles became the first team to clinch their division, as they wrapped up the NFC East with their win over the Washington Commanders on Saturday night. Philadelphia also became the first team to win the NFC East in back-to-back seasons since … the Eagles accomplished that feat back in 2004.\n\nSpeaking of the Panthers, Carolina moved into a playoff spot with their win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. If the postseason began today the Panthers would be in as the No. 4 seed. Tampa Bay’s loss dropped them out of the playoffs, and behind the Minnesota Vikings in the standings. The two teams have matching 7-8 records, but the Vikings have a better conference record.\n\nTampa Bay can still win the division, however, as they play Carolina in Week 18.\n\nChicago’s win over the Packers moved the Bears one step closer to an NFC North title, while putting Green Bay’s playoff chances onto shakier ground. Still, with the Lions losing to the Steelers on Sunday afternoon, the Packers still have some breathing room.\n\nChicago also clinched a playoff spot with the Lions’ loss, as did the 49ers.\n\nHere is what the NFC Wild Card matchups woulkd look like if the playoffs started today:\n\nNo. 7 Green Bay at No. 2 Chicago\n\nNo 6 San Francisco at No. 3 Philadelphia\n\nNo. 5 Los Angeles at No. 4 Carolina\n\nSeattle would have the No. 1 seed and the bye week.\n\nHere is the state of play in the AFC:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nLet’s start at the bottom of the playoff teams. Houston’s win over the Raiders gives the Texans a two-game lead over Indianapolis in the win column, ahead of the Colts’ game tonight against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers and the Buffalo Bills have matching 11-4 records, but the Chargers have a better AFC record (8-2 vs. 8-3) than the Bills, so the Chargers slot into the No. 5 slot while the Bills settle for No. 6. Los Angeles has two more AFC games remaining (Houston and Denver) while the Bills just have the Jets remaining on their list of AFC opponents.\n\nDenver’s loss to Jacksonville, coupled with New England’s win over the Baltimore Ravens, tightened things at the top of the AFC as both teams have matching 12-3 records. The Broncos remain in the top spot due to a better record in common games (6-0 versus 4-1), and Denver has clinched that tiebreaker. However, in addition to the Patriots and Broncos, the Jaguars, Chargers, Bills, and Texans are all alive in the chase for the No. 1 pick.\n\nHere is what the AFC playoffs would look like if they began today, with Denver having the bye week:\n\nNo. 7 Houston at No. 2 New England\n\nNo. 6 Buffalo at No. 3 Jacksonville\n\nNo. 5 Los Angeles at No. 4 Pittsburgh\n\nThere are going to be some new fans around the league rooting for the 49ers tonight.\n\nFirst, let’s start with what this game means for the teams playing on Monday Night Football. The 49ers clinched a playoff spot when the Lions lost to the Steelers, and are now jockeying for position in the NFC pecking order. If the 49ers defeat the Colts, they will improve to 11-4, tying them with the Los Angeles Rams. But the 49ers would move into the No. 5 spot and drop the Rams down to the No. 6 spot, thanks to San Francisco’s better division record. San Francisco is 4-1 in NFC West games, while the Rams are 3-2.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Seahawks are 3-2 in NFC West games as well, and they play San Francisco in Week 18 having already lost to the 49ers back in Week 1.\n\nIf the 49ers lose, they will remain in the No. 6 slot.\n\nAs for the Colts, they enter Monday Night Football on the outside looking in. A win would not move Indianapolis into a playoff spot, but they would close to within one game of the Texans for the No. 7 spot.\n\nBut if the Colts lose, they will be eliminated from AFC South title contention, and they would drop two games behind the Texans in the race for a playoff spot with two games remaining.\n\nIn addition, if the Colts lose, the Chargers, Bills, and Jaguars all clinch playoff spots.",

    "description": "A look at the NFC playoff picture and the Detroit Lions’ dwindling postseason odds and clinching scenarios.",
    "fullText": "With a devastating loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions have dropped to 8-7 on the season, and their playoff hopes are about as realistic as Calvin Johnson coming out of retirement. Here’s a look at what the playoff picture looks like, the Lions’ remaining playoff scenarios, and where the rest of the division and conference looks like.\n\nThe Lions can no longer win the NFC North, and the Bears are just a single win away from clinching their first division title since 2018. It’s a tough pill to swallow for Lions fans, as it appears Ben Johnson was the perfect hire for the Bears.\n\nThe Lions are actually in danger of falling into fourth place in the NFC North, and a loss to the Vikings on Christmas would nearly seal it. Both teams would be 8-8, the Vikings would finish with a season sweep of the Lions, and Detroit would finish the season with a tough matchup against a Bears team that may be still looking to clinch the division.\n\nOf course, maybe it would be a blessing in disguise for the Lions to finish last in the division so that they could play a fourth-place schedule next year (which would like feature games against the Giants, Titans, and Cardinals).\n\nWild Card race (top three advance)\n\nThe Lions’ best potential record is 10-7, meaning they can only mathematically catch the 49ers and Packers. But because the 49ers have locked in the tiebreaker over the Lions due to their conference record (8-2 vs. 5-5), the Packers are the only team Detroit can actually catch.\n\nObviously that would require the Lions to win both of their remaining games (at Vikings, at Bears), but the Packers would also have to lose out. Green Bay has the 7-8 Baltimore Ravens this upcoming week, who lost Lamar Jackson to a back injury on Sunday night. And they finish out with the Vikings, who lost J.J. McCarthy to a throwing hand injury on Sunday. Even though the Packers are struggling and have a bunch of injuries of their own, that seems very unlikely to happen.\n\nThe New York Times only gives the Lions a 6% chance to make the playoffs. NextGenStats has Detroit at 8%.",

He will be in attendance for the Detroit Lions at the Minnesota Vikings, providing insight on the NFC North rivals.\n\n\"Well, my hope at that point is that the Bears have locked up a spot in the playoffs, and I don't have to stress. However, they have a hell of a schedule coming up. They got Green Bay and San Francisco, then finished with Detroit,\" said Rollins, \"So for one night only, I will be a Minnesota Vikings fan. Don't tell anybody from Detroit. But yeah, I'm going to be rooting for the Vikings. I'm probably going to need them to take the Lions down a peg so that the Bears can lock in and get it done. But yeah, it should be a fun game.\"\n\nThe streaming service returns on Christmas Day with another NFL global doubleheader, following the Kansas City Chiefs' victory in last year's first-ever broadcast over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nGet ready for some action-packed Christmas magic 🎄 \n\nDallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders at 1 PM ET \nDetroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings at 4:30 PM ET \n\nLIVE on Netflix December 25 pic.twitter.com/pVUKmqtrCM\n\n— Netflix Sports (@netflixsports) December 3, 2025\n\nThe Vikings will rely on 2024 first-round draft pick J.J. McCarthy, who has been inconsistent due to injuries, while the Lions try to regain the dominant form that propelled them last season.\n\n\"Curious to see the progression of J.J. McCarthy and what he looks like in Kevin O'Connell's offense as he goes through sort of what his rookie year is. Obviously, he missed last season with the injury, but it's kind of his first go-around,\" said Rollins, \"Which Lions are we going to get? Lions from last year that dominated and maybe made an early playoff exit, or are we going to get a Lions team that misses the playoffs this season? It's going to be very interesting to see. Looking forward to the matchup, and yeah, I will be saying 'Skol' all afternoon.\"\n\nNetflix's inaugural NFL Christmas games in 2024 smashed streaming records, with the Chiefs vs. Steelers game averaging over 24 million U.S. viewers and reaching nearly 65 million unique viewers across the doubleheader, making it the most-streamed NFL games ever on the platform.\n\nRollins will star in WWE Unreal Season 2, premiering on January 20, 2026: https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-unreal-season-2-release-date-trailer-news.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: WWE Superstar Seth Rollins discusses Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

While there was a positive estimate after the game, Cleveland fans await confirmation on whether Judkins’ ligaments are intact.\n\nWith just one game left in Week 16, the Browns remain locked into the third spot in the 2026 NFL draft order, with the pick they acquired from the Jacksonville Jaguars likely awaiting the results in the NFL playoffs.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (via Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (via Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (via Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (via Jacksonville Jaguars)\n\nThe Giants and Raiders play each other next week, with Las Vegas also set to play the (zombie) Chiefs in Week 18.

It’s been a great experience here today and I don’t know what the future holds for me, but it was a special day for me and my family.”\n\n.@T_Hill4 on the past 9 years in New Orleans and what this city means to him pic.twitter.com/xSyUa2O99c\n\n— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) December 21, 2025\n\nHill restructured his contract last offseason, and there are no contractual ties to keep him in New Orleans beyond 2025. He started the year on the PUP list after having his 2024 campaign cut short by a significant knee injury that included a torn ACL, and it makes sense for a rebuilding Saints team to move in another direction.\n\n“I can tell you, I have so much love for the city of New Orleans and this fan base and the way that they’ve embraced me and my family,” Hill said.\n\n“It’s been really special. I wouldn’t want to play somewhere else, but there’s a lot of circumstances that are out of your control and I understand the nature of this business. I’m not thinking that way right now, but we’ll tackle that when we get there.”\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it.”\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Kellen Moore\n\nNew Orleans first-year coach Kellen Moore, who is Hill’s third head coach in his time with the Saints, shared what Hill has meant to the franchise.\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it,” Moore said. “His ability to play every phase of the offense and contribute on special teams is really special.\n\n“He’s an A-plus person, an A-plus human being and an A-plus player. Our young guys can learn a lot from him.”\n\n#Saints HC Kellen Moore on Taysom Hill:\n\n\"This league talks about trying to get Taysom Hills on your football team ... no one seems to be able to duplicate it.\" pic.twitter.com/JtZkkQWbVr\n\n— NOF (@nofnetwork) December 21, 2025\n\nIn Sunday’s game, Hill delivered an effort that was vintage Swiss Army Knife.\n\nHe led New Orleans in rushing, made plays from his tight end position and even threw a touchdown with under two minutes to play.\n\nThat score was something the Saints acknowledged they were trying to get for Hill, in case he doesn’t return.\n\nWhen he heard the team was trying to get Hill a touchdown, Olave made sure he was on the field at a point in the game when he didn’t need to be in the contest risking injury.\n\n“Definitely wanted to be a part of that, especially knowing they wanted to get Taysom a touchdown, so I wanted to be a part of that — a deep ball, too — so I definitely wanted to be in there,” Olave said.",

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Seahawks edge Patriots for new No. 1; Jaguars, Bears also rise; Packers fade for Week 17 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRanking all 32 teams in the NFL from best to worst for every week in the 2025 regular season has been a wild ride. With such a top-heavy league, the hierarchy can see a big change based on a few particular results.\n\nThat has often caused teams to jump high or fade fast in relation to the others near the top. Even the back end has seen some significant reshuffling of late.\n\nHere's Sporting News' latest breakdown from the tippy top to rock bottom coming out of Week 16:\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture after Week 16 results\n\nThe Seahawks won that thriller over the Rams with the offense rebounding after a slow passing start. They need Sam Darnold to cut down on the mistakes and keep raising the big plays to live up to their lofty playoff position.\n\nThe Patriots went into more of an offensive slump in Baltimore with Drake Maye cooling and being contained again, putting their chances of stealing the AFC East in serious jeopardy.\n\nMORE: Patriots clinch playoff spot for first time since 2021\n\nThe Rams had no problems moving the ball without Davante Adams with Matthew Stafford spreading the ball around and getting more from the running game. But the secondary issues in Seattle became more prevalent when the front cannot get pressure.\n\nThe Broncos couldn't find enough clean offense from Bo Nix to make another fourth-quarter comeback in what looked more like a blowout loss to the Jaguars. Their defense, having key lapses, is a shaky late development.\n\nThe Jaguars had their true statement victory in Denver, making six straight wins. Their road domination and finishing well in the fourth quarter bodes well for their playoff profile.\n\nMORE: 6 reasons why Jaguars are legitimate Super Bowl contenders\n\nThe Bears should be thrilled to have the late-game comeback mode of Caleb Williams, always giving them a chance. Chicago is pushing toward being a tough out in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: Bears take control of NFC North with win over Packers\n\nThe Bills were caught in a tough battle down the road in Cleveland as Josh Allen's clunker against a tough defense was saved by James Cook and the running game. The defense was fortunate to face a team with limited weapons to survive\n\nThe Chargers went into Dallas and used it for a get-well offensive game with more juice from their defense, too. Justin Herbert needed that and so did Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe 49ers should have loved the fact that the Seahawks took down the Rams on Thursday night. Their offense is red-hot and a win over the Colts would give them control of the division in the final two weeks.\n\nThe Eagles have got their offensive groove back with Saquon Barkley running well and Jalen Hurts' passing efficiently everywhere to silence the critics. They don't need to worry about the division anymore and can focus on getting into top shape for their Super Bowl defense in the playoffs.\n\nThe Packers saw Jordan Love get concussed in Chicago with Malik Willis playing well enough to win, but had too many offensive, defensive and special teams lapses to create a bigger mess than injuries.\n\nThe Texans were able to hold off the Raiders with resilient offense and just enough of their trademark defense. The hiccup is excusable with a win, but much must be fixed before facing the Chargers next week.\n\nMORE: Texans keep playoff hopes alive by escaping with win over Raiders\n\nThe Steelers found their running game again in Detroit to balance out the stellar run defense. They keep getting better at the right time to get into the playoffs on an uptick with Aaron Rodgers.\n\nThe Lions have been struggling to run the ball at will like they did last season and taking that element away, as the Steelers did. That and an injury-depleted defense have been the downfall for Detroit as a playoff contender.\n\nThe Panthers showed a lot of moxie in outlasting the Buccaneers with Bryce Young winning the biggest passing duel of his career. They have a great shot at making some noise should they get into the NFC playoffs.\n\nMORE: Panthers take control of NFC South with massive win over Buccaneers\n\nThe Colts will try to do more with a game Philip Rivers on Monday night against the 49ers with their season on the line, but the defense also may not oblige in a tough spot.\n\nThe Ravens had another defensive meltdown and other fourth-quarter big mistakes to blow another big lead, this time vs. the Patriots, spelling doom for a bad overall season, now maybe with Lamar Jackson not finishing healthy.\n\nMORE: Ravens' path to the postseason gets bleaker with loss to Patriots\n\nThe Buccaneers are making too many mistakes late in games, from the defense to Baker Mayfield. They can still get into the playoffs but there will be less inspiration for them to last long against a tough wild-card draw.\n\nThe Vikings can't seem to keep J.J. McCarthy healthy right when he builds positive momentum, but they still grounded out another win with enough clutch plays and more needed tough defense against what was a promising Giants offense.\n\nThe Cowboys look like they're running out of gas offensively to keep trying to make up for historically horrible all-around defense. This disappointment can't be blamed on Dak Prescott.\n\nThe Falcons are working to finish strong with wins over the Buccaneers and Cardinals making them feel better about the future of Raheem Morris as head coach. Credit Morris for getting them to be inspired with nothing left on the line.\n\nThe Chiefs can't be expected to win with their defense not having a pass rush and their offense not having a passing game minus Patrick Mahomes, Gardner Minshew and their top wide receiver. The fact they lost so easily on the road to the Titans is just so shocking.\n\nMORE: How Travis Kelce's retirement decision is easy with no Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe Saints took care of the lesser Jets at home with Tyler Shough chucking well with help from diverse weapons under Kellen Moore. He should go into Year 2 as the starting QB and the defense is also playing with a lot of late conviction.\n\nThe Bengals showed almost no life in Week 15 against the Ravens but got up off the mat to rip an overmatched and lesser-motivated Dolphins team with Joe Burrow needing that get-well performance late to try to end the season on a positive.\n\nThe Dolphins have faded fast from their rally back into playoff contention with dismal performances against the Steelers and Bengals in consecutive losses. Mike McDaniel can feel the heat again with the Tua Tagovailoa benching backfiring.\n\nThe Commanders just haven't fielded enough reliable defense all season long, with their age and youth showing in all the wrong places. They will just hope everything will change again with a healthy Jayden Daniels leading the offense.\n\nThe Titans are seeing a much-improved Cam Ward in recent weeks and it added up to a nice confidence-building win against the reeling Chiefs at home.\n\nThe Browns fought hard against the Bills with Shedeur Sanders showing the kind of fight and play that gets him a full-season audition as the starter in 2026 despite the defense falling apart around Myles Garrett.\n\nMORE: Myles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record with obscure half sack\n\nThe Cardinals' positive offensive vibes have hit a wall with Jacoby Brissett and the rest of their backups, who have had too much pressure to compensate for a Jonathan Gannon potential lame-duck defense.\n\nThe Jets did their best to stay competitive with Brady Cook starting again at quarterback but the bigger problem is Aaron Glenn's shell of an overall defense. They are a really lost, bad team.\n\nMORE: Updated NFL draft order after Week 16\n\nJaxson Dart was due for a clunker and the Vikings' defense delivered it to him. The lumps have been there enough to go forward with a new coaching system all-around.\n\nThe Raiders showed more life with their offense in of all places, Houston against the Texans' nasty defense. They also played their most inspired defensive game in weeks. It still wasn't enough to overcome their lack of execution.",

    "description": "A look at the Patriots’ game day roster for their Week 16 game on Sunday night.",
    "fullText": "With Robert Spillane sidelined throughout the game, the New England Patriots’ linebacker group had a disappointing outing last week versus the Buffalo Bills. The challenge will not be any easier for the position on Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nNot only will Spillane miss a second straight game because of an ankle injury, the Ravens feature one of the best run games in the NFL. Led by the two-headed monster of quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry, they are entering Sunday as the league leaders in yards per carry (5.2).\n\nWith Spillane out, that means the task on stopping this potent an attack will fall on replacement starting duo Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. As head coach Mike Vrabel pointed out on Friday, however, they will not be the only one in the spotlight.\n\n“Everybody that goes to the game is going to play and have a role, and we ask everybody to prepare as starters,” Vrabel explained. “That’s something that’s important. And so, Gibby will start in there, and then different guys will play, packages and everything else.”\n\nNew England’s full game day roster against the Ravens looks as follows:\n\nQuarterback (2): Drake Maye (10), Joshua Dobbs (11)\n\nRunning back (4): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), D’Ernest Johnson (34), Jack Westover (37 | FB/TE)\n\nWide receiver (5): Kayshon Boutte (9), Stefon Diggs (8), Mack Hollins (13), DeMario Douglas (3), Kyle Williams (18 | KR)\n\nTight end (2): Hunter Henry (85), Austin Hooper (81)\n\nOffensive tackle (3): Vederian Lowe (59 | LT), Morgan Moses (76 | RT), Thayer Munford Jr. (74)\n\nInterior offensive line (5): Jared Wilson (58 | LG), Garrett Bradbury (65 | C), Mike Onwenu (71 | RG), Ben Brown (77), Caedan Wallace (70)\n\nInterior defensive line (5): Christian Barmore (90), Khyiris Tonga (95 | FB), Cory Durden (94), Eric Gregory (55), Joshua Farmer (92)\n\nDefensive edge (5): Harold Landry III (2), K’Lavon Chaisson (44), Elijah Ponder (91), Anfernee Jennings (33), Bradyn Swinson (43)\n\nLinebacker (5): Jack Gibbens (51), Christian Elliss (53), Jahlani Tavai (48), Marte Mapu (15), Chad Muma (49)\n\nCornerback (5): Christian Gonzalez (0), Carlton Davis III (7), Marcus Jones (25 | PR), Charles Woods (22), Miles Battle (35)\n\nSafety (4): Jaylinn Hawkins (21), Craig Woodson (31), Dell Pettus (24), Brenden Schooler (41)\n\nSpecialists (3): Andy Borregales (36 | K), Bryce Baringer (17 | P/H), Julian Ashby (47 | LS)\n\nThe Patriots’ front seven is seeing some changes compared to last week. Not only is Chad Muma active as extra depth at linebacker and on special teams just five days after getting claimed off waivers from the Indianapolis Colts, two recent inactives are also up this week: Eric Gregory will provide additional depth at defensive tackle, while Bradyn Swinson should help on the edge.\n\nSwinson’s presence on the game day roster comes in light of starter Harold Landry being questionable with a knee injury. The fifth-round rookie has appeared in one game so far, playing 10 snaps in the kicking game but none on defense.\n\nInactives (5): QB3 Tommy DeVito (16), WR Efton Chism III (86), TE C.J. Dippre (82), OT Marcus Bryant (52), LB Robert Spillane (14)\n\nPractice squad (16): RB Jashaun Corbin (30), WR John Jiles (83), WR Jeremiah Webb (29), OL Sebastian Gutierrez (72), OL Andrew Rupcich (67), OL Brenden Jaimes (61), OL Mehki Butler (63), DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (98), DT Leonard Taylor III (93), DT Fabien Lovett Sr. (96), LB Amari Gainer (45), LB Otis Reese (54), CB Brandon Crossley (46), CB Kobee Minor (19), S Richie Grant (39), S John Saunders Jr. (23)\n\nPractice squad/exempt (1): TE Thomas Odukoya (88 | IPPP)\n\nPractice squad/injured (2): RB Craig Reynolds, LB Darius Harris\n\nReserve/injured (11): FB Brock Lampe, OT Yasir Durant, CB Marcellas Dial Jr., DT Jaquelin Roy, RB Lan Larison, RB Deneric Prince, DT Isaiah Iton, RB Antonio Gibson, DT Milton Williams, CB Alex Austin, OT Will Campbell, RB Terrell Jennings\n\nReserve/retired (1): OL Wes Schweitzer\n\nWith no players elevated from the practice squad, a total of five players were ruled out on Sunday. The list includes no surprises, with Spillane, who was deemed inactive ahead of the weekend already, as the only noteworthy absence.\n\nThe Patriots’ game against the Ravens will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.",

    "fullText": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers rookie safety Lathan Ransom has experienced the dramatic highs and lows of playing in the NFL in his first season.\n\nOne week after a crucial penalty that led to a costly loss to the New Orleans Saints, Ransom redeemed himself on Sunday by intercepting Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left to seal the Panthers' 23-20 win over the Buccaneers — allowing Carolina to vault into sole possession of first place in the NFC South.\n\n“I faced a lot of adversity, and I heard noise from everybody last week,” Ransom said. “... (But) that’s how you shake back.”\n\nRansom couldn't have felt much worse last week on the flight home from New Orleans after he was flagged for hitting sliding Saints quarterback Tyler Shough with 9 seconds left on a bang-bang play. Officials flagged Ransom for unnecessary roughness, and the 15-yard penalty turned a difficult 61-yard field goal attempt into a far more makable one from 46 yards.\n\nCharlie Smyth put it through the uprights to complete the Saints' 20-17 come-from-behind win.\n\nHad the Panthers defeated the Saints, they would have only needed to beat the Bucs on Sunday to clinch the NFC South and end a seven-year playoff drought. Instead, the loss left the Panthers on the outside of the playoff bubble.\n\nRansom said he was hard on himself.\n\nBut the fourth-draft pick from Ohio State decided early last week that instead of dwelling on the mistake he'd use it as motivation.\n\n“I understand that the game is not won or lost by one play, but people behind their phone are going to have their own opinions,” Ransom said. “I just heard all the noise — listened to it and used it as fuel for this game.”\n\nRansom leaned on the support last week of veteran defensive leaders such as Jaycee Horn, Derrick Brown and Mike Jackson, who shares the locker next to him.\n\nJackson and others advised to look ahead, not back and keeping playing at full speed.\n\n“He responded like a grown man should,\" Jackson said. “At the end of day, everyone was talking trash to him, like he shouldn't be in the game and this and that. And today he responded like he should be. I'll just say I'm proud of him. Because at the end of the day it's grown man football and he showed that.”\n\nPanthers coach Dave Canales greeted Ransom on the sideline with a huge hug after interception, and smiled as he spoke about the rookie after the game.\n\n“That’s a great story,” Canales said. “That’s fantastic and it’s just about belief and having confidence in our guys to be able to be studs about the things we need to work on and be studs about the different decisions that come up. I love that for Lathan — for him to be able to make the winning play, the biggest play of the game for us.”\n\nThe Panthers will need more big plays from Ransom and other young players if they hope to dethrone the Buccaneers, who have won the last four NFC South titles.\n\nCarolina can clinch the division with a win next week against Seattle and a Tampa Bay loss to Miami. But if the Bucs win, it will come down to a rematch in Week 18 for the division title.\n\n“I’ve learned a bunch throughout the season, especially from that first game,” Ransom said. “You’re going to learn. It’s a learning process. You’re playing with the best of the best. I learn more and more every game and I try to take those teachings into the next game.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "The Texans face the Raiders in Houston on Sunday. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 16.",
    "fullText": "Game result: The Texans beat the Raiders, 23-21, in Week 16. Houston improves to 10-5 on the year and stays at the No. 7 seed in the AFC Playoff picture. Houston remains a game behind the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC South, who moved to 11-4 with their win over the Denver Broncos on Week 16.\n\nThe Houston Texans are closing in on a playoff berth, but it will be at least another week before they will have a clinching scenario. The Texans host the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 16 and this is a game they absolutely cannot lose.\n\nThe Texans are 9-5 and have won six straight in a streak that has included wins over the Jaguars, Bills, Colts, and Chiefs. They beat the Cardinals 40-20 last week. The Texans face a Raiders squad that is 2-12 and has lost eight straight games. Last week, the Raiders were thumped by the Eagles 31-0 in Philly.\n\nHouston is a 14.5-point favorite, which is the biggest spread of Week 16.\n\nThe Texans are in second place in the division sitting one game back of the Jaguars. Houston and Jacksonville split their season series and the Texans have a half game lead for the divisional tiebreaker (4-1 vs. 3-1). The Jaguars are traveling to face the Broncos this weekend, so if they lose that but win their two remaining games, the tiebreaker would go to record in common games.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colts sit a game back of the Texans and still has one game left with them. Houston won the first game in Week 13. The Colts need to see the Texans lose in Week 16 or 17 to create a situation in which the Colts can finish ahead of them.\n\nThe Texans are in seventh place and hold the final wild card spot ahead of the 8-6 Colts and 7-7 Ravens. If the Texans win and the Colts lose, Houston would have a wild card clinching scenario in Week 17 when they travel to face the Chargers. The Texans enter Week 16 with a 98% chance of making the playoffs at The Athletic’s playoff simulator. Houston has a 58% chance of claiming a wild card berth and a 40% chance of winning the division.\n\nThe Raiders are a common opponent for the Texans and Jaguars. There is a very real chance the Texans and Jaguars finish tied and it common opponents. They are also a common opponent with the Chargers, but Houston and LA will have a head-to-head tiebreaker sorted out when they meet in Week 17.",

    "fullText": "Jason Pierre-Paul will be 37 on New Year’s Day, hasn’t played in an NFL game in two years or produced more than three sacks in any season since helping the Bucs win Super Bowl 55 following the 2020 season.\n\nWhen Tampa Bay signed him to its practice squad on Dec. 9, it wasn’t just to put pressure on opposing quarterbacks. The team felt it could use him to put heat on some of its own players on defense.\n\nBuy FIRE THE CANNONS: 50 Years of Tampa Bay Buccaneers Football\n\nThe Bucs didn’t just need an edge rusher. They needed an edge, someone whose passion might boil over into an opponent’s penalty. A teammate they would watch with a side-eye, never fully sure what he might do next. A player who made opponents uncomfortable and injected an attitude the locker room couldn’t manufacture.\n\nIn addition to an overall lack of consistent pressure from their defensive line and outside linebacker positions, the Bucs lack someone teammates are afraid to let down.\n\nThink about the best Bucs teams from the past. The Super Bowl 37 champions were stuffed with those kinds of players on defense. Warren Sapp. Even safety John Lynch, who is about as even-tempered off the field as anyone you will ever meet, was borderline maniacal between the lines. He knocked his brother-in-law (Bears tight end John Allred) out cold in a 1997 game at Soldier Field.\n\nHardy Nickerson was that guy when Lynch, Sapp and Derrick Brooks arrived.\n\nIt also helps that Pierre-Paul has a resume. He owns 94 ½ career sacks and 21 forced fumbles. Outside linebacker Yaya Diaby leads the Bucs with only six sacks this season.\n\nLess than two weeks after Pierre-Paul was signed to the practice squad, Diaby says he’s benefited from the two-time Super Bowl champion’s counsel.\n\n“It’s been good so far, man,” Diaby said. “I can’t even lie. He’s very intentional with what he’s done and what he sees that we’ve been doing that he can improve upon. Even for me, he’ll come up and say, ‘This is what you can do to get off real faster. You could’ve done this or done that.’\n\n“So, he’s been real intentional in trying to share whatever he can. Even (Wednesday), he was telling me, ‘I don’t know everything. But what I do know, I can help you with that.”\n\nOn Saturday, Pierre-Paul was elevated from the practice squad for Sunday’s game at Carolina. Head coach Todd Bowles had said earlier in the week that Pierre-Paul was “in play” for the NFC South showdown, even with no players forced to miss the game due to injury.\n\n“I think he’s coming in and getting back acclimated systematically in some of the things we’re asking him to do,” defensive pass game coordinator George Edwards. “But I think he’s been very attentive. It’s bought into calling some of the plays he’s done in the past. He’s here working hard, so we’ll see how it goes. You never know when your number is called to be in those situations.”\n\nPierre-Paul’s energy and passion for the game is infectious, Diaby said.\n\n“He loves it, and he’s still got some juice,” Diaby said. “He’s still got some juice.”\n\nThere’s been far too many miscommunications on the Bucs defense this season. Much of it is on the players. Some of it is opponents going fast to prevent an array of blitzes and coverages to be communicated before the snap.\n\nIt’s one of the reasons why there have been so many missed assignments, a player out of position here or there because the communication breaks down.\n\nBowles always has been known for the complexity of his defense and the ability to disguise an array of blitzes. But those take time to communicate.\n\nConsequently, opponents are getting to or staying on the ball quickly between snaps.\n\n“On third down, they speed it up some,” Bowles said. “We expect that. We’ve been getting that for the last two years. We have to have calls ready. We understand that, and we do have calls ready. We expect to get sped up some.”\n\nThe Bucs and Panthers are both 5-1 in games decided by three points or less this season.\n\nWhat makes them able to execute in pressure situations?\n\n“it’s just playing smart football,” Bowles said. ”We have to play smart football, and you can’t beat yourselves and you’ve got to execute.”\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "fullText": "Browns vs. Bills radio coverage: Station, channel, streaming to listen live to NFL Week 16 game broadcast originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills’ dramatic Week 15 victory over the New England Patriots was far more than a simple rivalry win; it was a season-saving, division-defining statement.\n\nTrailing 21-0 in the first half at Gillette Stadium, quarterback Josh Allen led the Bills on a historic comeback, scoring five consecutive touchdowns to erase the deficit and secure the thrilling 35-31 win. The victory was crucial, as it prevented the Patriots from clinching the AFC East title on their home turf and kept Buffalo's own slim division hopes mathematically alive heading into the final three weeks of the season.\n\nMore importantly for their immediate postseason aspirations, that massive win cemented the Bills (10-4) as the leading Wild Card contender in the highly competitive AFC playoff picture. Currently holding the No. 6 seed, Buffalo’s favorable tiebreakers give them a strong foothold as they enter a demanding closing schedule. With the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans nipping at their heels, maintaining momentum is essential to avoid being dragged back into the desperate fight for the final playoff spots.\n\nThat urgency brings the Bills to Cleveland this Sunday for a pivotal matchup against the Browns (3-11). While Cleveland has struggled through a disappointing season, their defense —led by the perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate Myles Garrett —remains highly disruptive. The quarterback battle is one to watch: Shedeur Sanders will make his fifth NFL start against the reigning MVP in Josh Allen.\n\nUltimately, Sunday's clash at Huntington Bank Field is an absolute \"must-win\" for Buffalo. Having survived the biggest challenge of their season by battling back against the Patriots, the Bills cannot afford a letdown against a struggling opponent if they want to secure their spot in the postseason for a seventh straight year. A win would keep the pressure squarely on New England in the AFC East race and put Buffalo on the very brink of officially punching their ticket as the top team in the AFC Wild Card standings.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channel 227 (home), 382 (away)\n\nBrowns radio channel: 92.3 The Fan, 98.5 WNCX and ESPN 850, The Cleveland Browns Radio Network\n\nThe matchup between the Browns and Bills can be found nationally on SiriusXM (channel 88), along with team-specific channels. The Bills can be found on 382 and the Browns on 227.\n\nLocally, fans in the Buffalo area can tune into WGR 550, which carries Bills games throughout Western New York.

    "description": "Who Patriots fans should be rooting for in Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots will try to get back into the win column this week versus the Baltimore Ravens. Naturally, all of our attention is on that particular Sunday night matchup. That said, some of the other 15 games around the NFL this week are also worth keeping a close eye on.\n\nWith that said, welcome to this week’s Patriots rooting guide.\n\nAs a disclaimer, we are looking at games through two primary lenses: New England’s chances of winning the division — which they cannot do this week — as well as earning the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Naturally and given the tiebreaker situation, not every game will be equally important even if it involves common opponents or other teams in the conference or division.\n\nThe Patriots were entering the weekend with a 73% chance of winning the division, according to The Athletic, and are 99+% favorite to make the playoffs (they actually can punch their ticket on Sunday). Their odds for the No. 1 seed are not nearly as good and a mere 10% at the moment.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7) at Carolina Panthers (7-7): Go good game! Division supremacy on the line, but the Patriots do not care who will win this one. | FOX\n\nBuffalo Bills (10-4) at Cleveland Browns (3-11): Go Browns! The Patriots won’t lock up the division this week either way, but Buffalo dropping this one would give them more wiggle room: if the Bills lose and they beat the Ravens, the Patriots would be up two games with two weeks to go. | CBS\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (10-4) at Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1): Go Cowboys! The Chargers entering the competition for the No. 1 seed in the AFC is unlikely but not entirely impossible. This is merely based on keeping another competitor away from the race for the first-round bye in the conference. | FOX\n\nCincinnati Bengals (4-10) at Miami Dolphins (6-8): Go Dolphins! Miami is out of the playoffs, so all wins do over the last three weeks is further weaken the team’s draft position. | CBS\n\nNew York Jets (3-11) at New Orleans Saints (4-10): Go Jets! This is the same we talked about with the Dolphins, namely that the Jets adding some more wins down the stretch would end up hurting their draft stock. | CBS\n\nMinnesota Vikings (6-8) at New York Giants (2-12): Go good game! This all-NFC matchup has no impact on the Patriots. | FOX\n\nKansas City Chiefs (6-8) at Tennessee Titans (2-12): Go Titans! The more games the Chiefs end up losing, the better for New England: they own a Kansas City sixth-rounder next year courtesy of the Joshua Uche trade. The worse their record, the better positioned the pick. | CBS\n\nAtlanta Falcons (5-9) at Arizona Cardinals (3-11): Go good game! Nothing to see here, really. | FOX\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (10-4) at Denver Broncos (12-2): Go Jaguars! This is a big one. If the Patriots want to take over the No. 1 seed in the AFC, they will need Denver to start losing some games. This one against the red hot Jaguars is a realistic candidate. | FOX\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (8-6) at Detroit Lions (8-6): Go Lions! The Steelers missing out on the playoffs would be good news for the Patriots and the sixth-round draft pick they received as part of the Kyle Dugger trade. Obviously, in an ideal scenario, Pittsburgh would still be ahead of the Ravens after Week 16, but a loss here would keep the chances intact of Baltimore eventually leap-frogging their division rivals and pushing them out of postseason contention. | CBS\n\nLas Vegas Raiders (2-12) at Houston Texans (9-5): Go good game! Even though this is a game between two AFC teams, including one competing for a playoff spot, the game has no real impact on New England. | CBS\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (10-4) at Indianapolis Colts (8-6): Go Colts! We end the week with a focus on draft positioning. In the unlikely case the 49ers drop out of the playoff picture in the NFC, the Patriots would benefit: the conditional sixth-round pick acquired in the Keion White trade would be better positioned in that case. | ESPN\n\nThe following games have taken place earlier in the week:\n\nLos Angeles Rams (11-3) at Seattle Seahawks (11-3): Go good game! Given the stakes, this is one of the top Thursday night games in recent memories. And while it has no impact on the Patriots, it should be a fun watch nonetheless. | LA 37, SEA 38 (OT)\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (9-5) at Washington Commanders (4-10): Go good game! A no-impact game from a Patriots perspective. | PHI 29, WAS 18\n\nGreen Bay Packers (9-4-1) at Chicago Bears (10-4): Go Packers! While the game won’t change New England’s playoff outlook, it could end up impacting the draft. The Patriots, after all, own the Bears’ fourth-round pick sent to them by the Chiefs as part of an in-draft trade last year. | GB 16, CHI 22 (OT)\n\nThis article also serves as an open thread for this week’s games.

    "fullText": "Best NFL players ever on the worst teams: Myles Garrett, Calvin Johnson and the 16 most wasted talents in history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCleveland edge rusher Myles Garrett is on the edge of making NFL history.\n\nGarrett – who has 21.5 sacks – can tie the NFL single-season sack record held by former Giants star Michael Strahan and Steelers edge rusher T.J Watt with his next sack. Garrett, of course, is playing for the Browns – who have been eliminated from the AFC playoff race.\n\nThat's going to beg the question: Is Garrett the best player on the worst team in NFL history? We're not just talking about this year. We're talking for the entirety of their career.\n\nSporting News identified 16 NFL stars – including eight Pro Football Hall of Fame players – who fit that description. We ranked those players based on four categories, including worst team winning percentage, playoff appearances (fewest scored higher), Pro Bowl selections (highest to lowest) and NFL MVP or AP Defensive Player of the Year Awards. In the event of a tie, the player whose teams had a lower winning percentage wen\n\nThis balances the great player vs. how good, or in this case bad, their team was.\n\nGarrett is in the top 10 along with another active edge rusher in the NFL. Who else made the list? A look at the 16 best NFL players on the worst teams.\n\nMORE:Tracking Myles Garrett's NFL single-season sacks record chase\n\nTeams: Saints (1999-2001), Dolphins (2002-03, 2005, 2007-10), Ravens (2011)\n\nWilliams – who rushed for 10,009 yards – had a rough start in New Orleans. He played for seven different head coaches – ranging from Mike Ditka to Nick Saban – retired for a year and was suspended for another. Williams played on a 3-13 team in New Orleans and a 1-15 team in Miami.\n\nTeams: Buccaneers (1987-92), Browns (1993-95), Ravens (1996-97), Jets (1998-2003, 2005), Cowboys (2004), Patriots (2006), Panthers (2007)\n\nTeam playoff record: 4–3 (2-3 as a starter)\n\nThe Buccaneers were 28-67 in six seasons after selecting Testaverde with the No. 1 pick in the 1987 NFL Draft. Testaverde was 23-25 in three seasons with Bill Belichick in Cleveland. He spent two seasons in Baltimore before the best stretch of his career with the Jets and made a start in the 1998 AFC championship game against Denver. Testaverde reunited with Bill Parcells in Dallas and Belichick in New England late in his career. He finished with a 90-123-1 record as a starter with 46,233 yards, which ranks 18th on the all-time list.\n\nTeams: Bengals (1996-2007), Ravens (2008)\n\nAnderson – a four-time Pro Bowl selection – played for four different coaches during the late 1990s and early 2000s \"Bungles\" era, and he played on just one winning team in 12 seasons with the franchise. Anderson played in one playoff game – a heart-breaking 31-17 loss to the Steelers in the AFC Wild Card round. Anderson did reach the AFC championship game with rival Balti\n\nTeams: Colts (1983-89), Falcons (1990-93), Vikings (1994-95)\n\nHinton – a seven-time Pro Bowl selection – was the player the Colts got in the John Elway trade. Hinton was a mainstay at tackle, but the Colts had four straight losing seasons after his arrival. Hinton played in four playoff games in his career, which also had stints with the Falcons and Vikings. He probably deserves more Pro Football Hall of Fame consideration.\n\nSanders – who ranks fourth all time in NFL history with 15,269 yards – played on decent teams. Detroit had a winning record in five of his 10 seasons and made the NFC championship game in 1991. Sanders abruptly retired in 1998 after the Lions finished 5-11 in 1998. Sanders' highlight reel has been passed down a few generations – but he never played in a Super Bowl.\n\nTeams: Rams (2004-12), Falcons (2013-14), Patriots (2015)\n\nJackson played on some miserable teams in St. Louis. The Rams averaged three wins per season from 2007-11 – a stretch in which Jackson had five straight 1,000-yard seasons. He finished his career with 11,438 rushing yards, and one of his two career playoff victories was in an abbreviated final season with the Patriots in 2015.\n\nSayers had a brief-but-brilliant career with the Bears, which was cut short by injuries. Sayers played for George Halas for four seasons – a stretch where Chicago compiled a 28-25-3 record. He led the NFL in rushing with 236 carries for 1,032 yards and eight TDs in 1969, a season in which the Bears finished 1-13.\n\nTeams: Saints (1993-2001); Chiefs (2002-05)\n\nRoaf was a dominant tackle in the NFL for the Saints – and he played for three head coaches in Jim Mora, Mike Ditka and Jim Haslett. New Orleans won one playoff game – a 34-24 victory against St. Louis in the NFC Wild Card round – on Dec. 30, 2000. He played four seasons with Kansas City – including two winning teams – to end his career.\n\nTeams: Jaguars (2006-13), Raiders (2014)\n\nJones-Drew helped Jacksonville reach the AFC divisional playoffs in his second season, but it went downhill from there despite a successful career in which he finished with 8,167 rushing yards in nine seasons. MJD played on teams that won an average of three games in his final three seasons between Jacksonville and Oakland.\n\nStephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nCrosby – who has 69.5 career sacks – has been with the franchise since the move from Oakland to Las Vegas. He has endured four straight losing seasons with the Raiders and has played for three coaches in each of the last three seasons. Yet Crosby remains on a trajectory that would get him to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Browns went 0-16 in Garrett's first season, so it's technically been uphill from there. Garrett has played for the same coach for six seasons in Kevin Stefanski, and the Browns did beat the Steelers 48-37 in the AFC Wild Card round on Jan. 10, 2021. It hasn't been all bad for the former No. 1 pick.\n\nJohnson never played on a team that won a playoff game. Detroit finished 0-16 in his second season, but \"Megatron\" continued to produce at a ridiculous level. The six-time Pro Bowl selection had 122 catches for a single-season record 1,964 receiving yards in 2012. Detroit had two winning seasons in nine years with Johnson on the field.\n\nKennedy – an eight-time Pro Bowl selection – never played on a team that won 10 games or \n\nYou can't think about the Tampa Bay creamsicle jerseys without Selmon, the six-time Pro Bowl selection who dominated at defensive tackle for the Bucs despite some woeful teams. Tampa Bay went 0-14 in Selmon's rookie season, and they lost 10 or more games six times in his nine seasons.\n\nButkus – arguably the most-feared defensive player of his era – was on the same teams as Gale Sayers, but the linebacker played two more seasons. Butkus made the Pro Bowl eight times in eight seasons before his final year, in which he played just nine games. He also finished in the top five in the NFL MVP voting twice despite playing for teams that finished with records of 8-8 and 7-9, respectively.\n\nThomas is the easiest choice here. He was a 10-time Pro Bowl selection in Cleveland despite a cast of revolving door of quarterbacks and coaches through one of the most-unstable periods for any franchise in NFL history. Cleveland went 10-6 in Thomas' first season. The Browns never won more than five games over the next 10 years, and Thomas' final season was the 0-16 year in 2017. Despite that, Thomas remains one of the most-beloved athletes in Cleveland sports history.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nYou may have felt that this was the case for some time already in a matter of fact sense, but it became official on Saturday night when the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Washington Commanders. Thanks to losses over the last two weeks to the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings the Cowboys left themselves with only one path into the postseason and that was as the hypothetical winner of the NFC East. That will not come to pass as the Eagles have now won it.\n\nMuch is always made about how the NFC East has not featured a back-to-back champion since 2003 and 2004 when the Eagles did it themselves. They have put that all to an end by doing it once more and on the subject of streaks the Cowboys now have one going themselves as far as playoff absences are concerned.\n\nDallas missed the playoffs last year, they were eliminated around the same time as it happened on December 22nd, which means they have missed the postseason for two years in a row for the first time since 2019 and 2020. Then, like now, the Cowboys were in the final year of one head coach (Jason Garrett) and the first of another (Mike McCarthy). It is almost like that is not necessarily a recipe for success.\n\nThere is a lot of introspection that is necessary from the Cowboys these days and their current playoff drought is representative of that. We talk often about how this team hasn’t been the same since they were bounced from the 2023 Wild Card Round and obviously the evidence here speaks for that as well.\n\nWe now know conclusively that there are only 3 games left on the season for the Cowboys. We also know that their drought for Super Bowl and/or NFC Championship Game appearances (the drought that Stephen Jones didn’t understand to exist) will officially grow to 30 years. It is not an approximation or a rounding up.",

    "fullText": "It's going to be a Blue Christmas for Tua Tagovailoa, who has been benched by the Dolphins. With Miami breaking in a rookie QB, my NFL props are betting on RB De'Von Achane to carry the offense.\n\nSee why I'm backing Achane, Jacoby Brissett, and Aaron Rodgers with my favorite NFL player props for Week 16 in the NFL.\n\nKyler Murray who? Jacoby Brissett gone over his passing yards total in all nine of his starts this season. He has thrown the ball at least 40 times in six straight contests, averaging a whopping 45.7 pass attempts per game over that span.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have struggled to run the ball and have practically abandoned that part of their offense. They are second in the NFL in passing play percentage (65.4%), with that number ballooning to 72.5% over the last six weeks.\n\nThe Cardinals are hosting the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday in a beautiful 76-degree day at State Farm Stadium. That should lead to plenty of throwing from a pair of teams with nothing to play for except pride.\n\nWith the Miami Dolphins starting seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers at QB expect them to lean on their rushing attack against a piss-poor Bengals run defense. Cincinnati is 30th in the NFL in defensive rush EPA and allows a league-high 157.9 rushing yards per game.\n\nEven if the Bengals sell out to stop the run, they won't be able to contain Achane. They allow 5.0 yards per carry when stacking the box, and De'Von Achane averages 5.8 yards per attempt when running against a stacked box.\n\nAchane is coming off a game where he was limited to 60 yards on 12 carries due to a negative game script. However, he had rushed for more than 90 yards in his previous four contests, averaging 130.0 rushing yards per game over that span.\n\nAaron Rodgers is coming off back-to-back contests where he completed 23 passes in wins against the Dolphins and Ravens. The four-time MVP is proving that he still has something left in the tank, and he faces a struggling Detroit Lions pass defense in Week 16.\n\nThe Lions are 25th in the league in dropback EPA since Week 9. Their injury-depleted secondary is getting picked apart with Detroit allowing 24.3 completions per game over the last three contests.\n\nWith the Lions 7-point faves on Sunday, expect a negative game script for the Pittsburgh Steelers with plenty of passing. Rodgers has completed more than 20.5 passes in six of his last nine games and should eclipse that number again.\n\nAfter a red-hot start to the season, Jacksonville Jaguars running back Travis Etienne Jr. has cooled off. Etienne has logged fewer than 60 rushing yards in six of his last 10 games and is averaging just 3.8 yards per carry over that span.\n\nHe was held to fewer than 35 rushing yards and less than 3.0 ypa in two of his last three games. What's especially concerning about those numbers is that they came with a positive game script against terrible Titans and Jets defenses.\n\nHe'll have a much tougher time in Week 16 against a Denver stop unit that allows the second-fewest rushing yards per game (90.9) on 3.9 yards per carry. Etienne is at his best on outside zone runs, where he averages 6.9 yards per rush. However, the Broncos allow just 3.3 yards per rush on outside zone attempts.\n\nNew Orleans Saints wideout Chris Olave reeled in six catches for 85 yards last week. He has logged at least 62 receiving yards in six of his last nine games, and he's finally getting good quarterback play with Tyler Shough under center.\n\nOlave gets a mouth-watering matchup this week at home against the New York Jets, who traded away top corner Sauce Gardner at the deadline. The Jets are 31st in the league in defensive dropback EPA while ranking 28th in DVOA against No. 1 WRs.\n\nOlave has been the Saints' only reliable pass catcher after they traded Rashid Shaheed and Brandin Cooks, so expect him to get fed the ball. This is a five-star play according to EV Analytics, which is projecting 71.57 yards for Olave.\n\nBrissett o37.5 pass attempts (-120)\n\nRodgers o20.5 completions (-138)\n\nEtienne u60.5 rush yards (-114)\n\nOlave o61.5 receiving yards (-114)\n\nMy NFL weekly props column is 39-31 this season for +3.86 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "This 2025 NFL season hasn’t been what was expected from the Arizona Cardinals. In a division full of some of the league’s best ballclubs, the Cardinals aren’t one of them.\n\nBut there are silver linings. And with some, you don’t have to look too hard. Arizona tight end Trey McBride might be this year’s brightest star on the roster. He has already set one league record several weeks ago, and now this past weekend, he set two more.\n\nIn the Cardinals’ 40-20 loss to the Houston Texans this past Sunday, McBride had 12 receptions for 134 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead all pass catchers.\n\nAmong the flow of the game, McBride set two records: 1) “Most consecutive games by a tight end with five or more catches,” and 2) “First tight end in NFL history to have 100 catches or \n\nWith the first record, McBride now has 16 consecutive games, which broke the record of 15 held by Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2018.\n\nLast year, McBride caught 111 passes for 1,146 yards. He now has 105 passes for 1,071 this season with three games remaining.\n\nMcBride can now set his sights on the NFL record for “Most receptions by a tight end in a single season.” The record is 116 catches set by former Cardinal Zack Ertz in 2018 while he was playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. Needing an even dozen in three games shouldn’t be an issue for McBride.\n\nHe is currently ranked #1 in receptions in the league, #2 in targets, #3 in touchdowns, #4 in first down conversions, #6 in total yards gained, and #25 in pass completions of 20+ yards.\n\nTwo weeks ago, McBride broke the NFL record for the “Most receptions by a tight end in his first four seasons in the league.” The old record was set by tight end Jimmy Graham, who had 3,863 yards on 301 receptions. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 13, McBride led all receivers with eight catches for 82 yards and a touchdown, and finished with 309 career receptions. He has since added to that total.",

    "fullText": "With the College Football Playoff kicking off, here are some of the most notable NFL Draft prospects to watch for this weekend.\n\nAlabama against Oklahoma is a rematch from earlier this season. Oklahoma pulled out a close victory against the Crimson Tide 23 to 21 in that game. I expect this game to come right down to the wire once again. We have previously discussed some Alabama prospects like Kadyn Proctor, Tim Keenan III, Deontae Lawson, and Keon Sabb. The Cincinnati Bengals could be looking to add a cornerback to replace Cam Taylor-Britt going into next year. Alabama’s Domani Jackson could be a player who intrigues the Bengals. He feels like a player that could go anywhere from rounds three to five during the draft this year. While he hasn’t had the season that many expected, he is still a solid draft prospect. He is expected to run a 4.3 40-yard dash or potentially even lower. Jackson is a great athlete with return ability, an excellent run defender, and rarely misses a tackle. He has an incredible 2.6% missed tackle rate on the 2025 season.\n\nDomani Jackson (Alabama CB #1)\n-Uses his long frame to force receivers off of their route and disrupt timing of the play\n-Shows scheme flexibility and is capable in both man and zone coverage\n-Has moments where his build and toughness align effectively as a true bump and run… pic.twitter.com/CYIsf4ShLT\n\n— Owen Denny (@OwenDennyNFL) December 4, 2025\n\nOklahoma has a plethora of defensive talent that should be of interest to the Bengals. We have mentioned previously R.Mason Thomas, Robert Spears-Jennings, Kip Lewis, and Gracen Halton. Another player on that defense worth mentioning for the 2026 NFL Draft is Damonic Williams. Williams is a day three space eating defensive tackle. Williams is listed at 6’1” and 323 pounds. He does his best work as a run defender in the middle of the Sooners defense. Williams originally spent a couple of seasons playing for TCU.\n\nDamonic Williams about to wreck SEC O-Lines! 😤\n pic.twitter.com/veDDTDhX1n\n\n— The Main Line (@TheMainLinePod) May 3, 2024\n\nTexas A&M has a lot of talent in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Cashius Howell, Tyler Onyedim, and Albert Regis headline the defensive line. On the offensive line they are loaded with draft-elibile talent like Trey Zuhn III, Dametrious Crownover, Chase Bisontis, and Ar’maj Reed-Adams. If the Bengals decide to not re-sign Dalton Risner, they may look once again toward the draft for a right guard. While that isn’t a guarantee with Jalen Rivers here, it is at least worth mentioning. Reed-Adams is a right guard prospect that could come in and compete to start early. He is a mauling presence on the interior that loves to finish plays, sometimes to his own detriment with penalties. That type of nasty is something this Cincinnati team is missing.\n\nAr’maj Reed-Adams is a DAWG at Right Guard (even took some Right Tackle snaps in this one) pic.twitter.com/tmBzRySVIh\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) May 8, 2025\n\nMiami is equally as impressive on both sides of the ball in the trenches. On offense, they have Francis Mauigoa, Markel Bell, Anez Cooper, and James Brockermyer. On the defensive line they have Rueben Bain Jr., Ahmad Moten Sr., and Akheem Mesidor. Mesidor is an older prospect that will be turning 25 years old. We have seen previously with the pick of Demetrius Knight Jr., that age may not scare the Bengals off from taking an older guy on day two. Mesidor has 30 career sacks between his time at West Virginia and Miami. When healthy, he is an explosive pass rusher with a quick first step and a variety of pass rush moves in his arsenal. He has a 29.9% win rate on true pass sets during the 2025 season.\n\nAkheem Mesidor (#3) Miami vs. Notre Dame – Mesidor will turn 25 years old in April and has put up 7 sacks, 43 pressures, and 4 forced fumbles so far this season. \n\nAt 6’3” 280 pounds he offers inside and outside versatility along the defensive line. He is a high effort player,… pic.twitter.com/gZ8wqkZ7aS\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 26, 2025\n\nOle Miss will be entering this game without former head coach Lane Kiffin. Kiffin will not be coaching in the playoffs after taking the LSU job. Ole Miss still has a ton of talented players and should easily handle Tulane this weekend. Zxavian Harris is a big-bodied defensive tackle I have previously discussed. They also have Dae’quan Wright, Harrison Wallace III, and De’Zhaun Stribling as offensive weapons. Another player that continues to intrigue me is Suntarine Perkins. The Bengals have tried to use Demetrius Knight Jr. as a player that can come off the edge at times with limited results. While Knight did put up two sacks this week, it was while playing the role of a spy on Lamar Jackson. If they want a player with real pass rush juice from the linebacker position, Perkins may be there guy. Perkins had 10.5 sacks last season while playing more on the edge. This year, he has just two sacks but has shown that he can play more as an off-ball linebacker, which he needed to do at only 6’1” 210 pounds.\n\nOle Miss's Suntarine Perkins might be my favorite prospect I watched all summer. Can't remember someone his size (6-1, 210) playing on the line of scrimmage in a major conference and still being a difference maker. \n\nDon't care where he plays, I want him on my football team pic.twitter.com/EAjzxQJC8Q\n\n— Mike Renner (@mikerenner_) July 30, 2025\n\nFor Tulane, there really isn’t much to talk about for the draft. Quarterback Jake Retzlaff is a transfer from BYU that might get a camp invitation. He is unlikely to be on a roster in the NFL next year. The best prospect for them is defensive tackle/defensive end Santana Hopper, but it sounds like he will be entering the transfer portal and remaining in college football next year.\n\nTulane first-team all-conference DL Santana Hopper is expected to enter the transfer portal following the College Football Playoff, sources tell @On3sports. \n\nHas 13 career sacks. https://t.co/wMrfFrcNOy pic.twitter.com/rOyVZFN4v7\n\n— Pete Nakos (@PeteNakos) December 16, 2025\n\nAnother contest that is likely to be heavily one sided features Oregon taking on James Madison. Oregon has a ton of draft-eligible talent including Dante Moore (QB), Noah Whittington (RB), Kenyon Sadiq (TE), Isaiah World (OT), Alex Harkey (OT), Emmanuel Pregnon (OG), Iapani Laloulu (OC), Matayo Uiagalelei (DE), Bear Alexander (DT), A’Mauri Washington (DT), Bryce Boettcher (LB), Jadon Canady (CB), and Dillon Thieneman (S). Thieneman is the most likely player that could end up a Cincinnati Bengal. The rangy safety prospect has good straight-line speed and has been highly productive for both Purdue and Oregon during his time in college football.\n\nDillon Thieneman vs. Indiana pic.twitter.com/WEel3shdxI\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 20, 2025\n\nSimilar to Tulane, there really isn’t much for James Madison as far as draft prospects for this year. Wayne Knight is probably the best prospect on their team. However, the running back is listed at just 5’7”. He is listed at weighing around 190 pounds and has shown impressive contact balance. Knight has rushed for almost 1300 yards in 2025. He has also added almost 400 more yards as a receiver. Knight will have to play out of his mind against Oregon for James Madison to even keep this one close.\n\nJust incredible contact balance from James Madison’s Wayne Knight to pop through here.\n\nHe’s top three in the Sun Belt in rushing yards after contact pic.twitter.com/6IELz0SmUM\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) December 6, 2025",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks pulled off an NFL first in their dramatic, improbable 38-37 win over the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday Night Football.\n\nWhen Sam Darnold threw the decisive pass to Eric Saubert for the game’s final points, the Seahawks became the first team in NFL history to win an overtime game via two-point conversion.\n\nDARNOLD. SAUBERT. @SEAHAWKS WIN! pic.twitter.com/VF2QElidFV\n\nThis year is the first season in which regular season overtime does not automatically end on an opening drive offensive touchdown. The only difference between regular season and playoff overtime (which eliminated “offensive touchdown on first possession wins the game” starting in the 2022 season) is that regular season OT is still just 10 minutes and not 15. Barring a defensive or special teams touchdown (or a safety), both offenses must possess the ball at least once.\n\nThe catalyst for this change was the famous Kansas City Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills AFC Divisional playoff classic in the 201 season, in which Josh Allen never touched the ball in overtime and the Chiefs scored a touchdown on the first possession and never looked back.\n\nWhile we’ve yet to see an opening drive overtime touchdown under the current rules in the playoffs, this is the first time that a team has conceded an overtime touchdown and come back to win the game. The Jacksonville Jaguars scored a touchdown against the Las Vegas Raiders earlier this season, only for the Raiders to respond with their own. Geno Smith’s winning pass to Tyler Lockett was batted down and Jacksonville won.\n\nIt’s only fitting that such a weird thing would first be done by the Seahawks. We expect nothing less.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams' Week 16 loss to the Seattle Seahawks was historic.\n\nThe Rams had everything going for them in the fourth quarter. They had a two-score lead and were dominating on both sides of the ball all night long.\n\nBut the Seahawks didn't quit and managed to rally over the final nine minutes to force the game into overtime, where Seattle again fell behind after a Rams touchdown on the opening possession of the extra frame.\n\nSeattle came storming back, though, and scored its own touchdown before securing the victory with a two-point conversion.\n\nWith the loss, the Rams became the first team since at least 1975 to gain 400 yards or more, have zero giveaways, zero sacks taken and record three or more takeaways and still lose, according to NFL stats guru Dante Koplowitz-Fleming.\n\nPreviously, teams were 79-0 when hitting those marks.\n\nThe loss was enormous for the Rams, who now fall to second place in the NFC West and into the No. 5 seed in the conference.\n\nMeanwhile, the Seahawks move into first place in the division and the No. 1 seed in the conference with two games left to play while also clinching a playoff berth.\n\nBut things are far from settled, as the Rams can still catch the Seahawks, and the same goes for the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe Niners will take the field on Monday night against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nNext week, the the Niners draw the Chicago Bears, while the Seahawks get the Carolina Panthers and the Rams face the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nWhen is Davante Adams coming back?

    "description": "Targeting value in Week 16 NFL betting? We break down three plus-money predictions worth backing, with matchup analysis, betting angles, and odds insight.",
    "fullText": "Plus-money props are where opportunity meets context, and this week offers plenty of both.\n\nA rookie quarterback heading on the road is being undervalued by the market, while two proven veterans are playing with real money on the line as contract incentives come into focus.\n\nMotivation, matchup, and usage all align to create outsized NFL picks at longer odds.\n\nSince returning to the lineup, J.J. McCarthy looks rejuvenated, throwing five touchdown passes against vulnerable Washington and Dallas defenses. The Giants profile similarly when it comes to stopping offenses near the goal line, making this another spot where efficiency should show up on the scoreboard.\n\nNew York ranks bottom five in red-zone defense and is riding an eight-game losing skid, allowing 31.5 points per game. This is a defense that struggles to stop drives, and the Minnesota Vikings are well-positioned to take advantage. McCarthy has also shown he’s not afraid to push the ball downfield, ranking second in air yards per attempt while benefiting from the second-best protection rate in the league at 88 percent.\n\nMinnesota’s red-zone tendencies further support the Over. The Vikings have been ineffective running the ball near the goal line to the point that C.J. Ham handled the short-yardage touchdown last week. As a result, Minnesota ranks among the most pass-heavy teams in the red zone. All signs point toward McCarthy clearing 1.5 passing touchdowns.\n\nStefon Diggs has incentive money firmly in play with three games remaining. He’s three receptions shy of a $500K bonus, and 13 catches away from another $500K, putting a total of $1 million on the line. Diggs has recorded at least three receptions in all but one game this season, but has been quieter recently in a pair of run-heavy matchups against the Bills and Giants.\n\nThat could change this week against Baltimore, a defense allowing the sixth-most receptions to wide receivers. If Diggs wants to make a real push toward that second incentive at 80 catches, the volume needs to start building now. With the Jets up next and a Week 18 matchup against Miami that could turn run-heavy if playoff positioning is settled, this sets up as a spot where Diggs is motivated, and the matchup finally cooperates.\n\nFollow me here, because this angle makes sense. Nick Folk has been one of the most reliable kickers in the league, converting 96.2 percent of his attempts, the best mark in the NFL. This also happens to be his final indoor game of the season before trips to the Meadowlands and Orchard Park in Weeks 17 and 18, where kicking conditions become far less predictable.\n\nFolk sits at 25 made field goals and has significant incentives in play, earning $375K at 27 makes and another $500K if he reaches 30. He kicks for an offense that struggles to finish drives and draws another favorable matchup against the Saints this week. Indoors, the leash is longer, and there’s a real chance the coaching staff is more aggressive with long attempts than they’d consider outdoors. Folk has missed just one kick all season and is 7-for-8 from 50-plus, which could turn a few borderline decisions into field goal tries with real incentive-driven upside.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Thursday delivers a slate built around one game that carries monumental weight in the NFL, as the Seahawks and Rams collide in a pivotal divisional showdown with major playoff implications on the line. While the spotlight shines brightest on the NFC West battle, the night also features a full menu of NHL action where matchups, trends and numbers create value across the board. Here are tonight’s best bets brought to you by BetOnline.ag. All new players get a 50% welcome bonus and up to $250 in free bets.\n\nRundown: A pair of 11-3 teams collide on Thursday Night Football as the Los Angeles Rams travel to Seattle to face the Seahawks, with sole possession of first place in the NFC West on the line.\n\nTonight marks uncharted territory for the NFL. For the first time in league history, two teams with 11 or more wins meet on Thursday Night Football, as the Rams and Seahawks square off with the No. 1 seed hanging in the balance. Given the stakes, the matchup has a strong case as the most significant Thursday night game the league has ever seen.\n\nAccording to FTN’s proprietary metric DVOA (defensive-adjusted value over average), these are two of the best teams ever through 14 games. The statistic has been tracked since 1978, with the 2007 Patriots ranking No. 1 all time after finishing the regular season a perfect 16-0.\n\nHistory in the making 👀\n\nWeek 15 DVOA Ratings ➡️ https://t.co/T1Gel5KrfN pic.twitter.com/azJiozirlq\n\n— FTN Fantasy (@FTNFantasy) December 17, 2025\n\nSeattle and Los Angeles have been elite on both sides of the ball, each ranking inside the top five in scoring offense and scoring defense. Much of that success has been driven by two of the NFL’s premier wide receivers. Seattle’s Jaxon Smith-Njigba leads the league with 1,541 receiving yards on 96 catches, while Los Angeles has leaned heavily on third-year wideout Puka Nacua. The Rams will likely be without Davante Adams, however, as the future Hall of Famer is dealing with a hamstring injury suffered in Sunday’s win over Detroit.\n\nWeather could also a noteworthy factor that affects the outcome. Rain is expected throughout the night in Seattle, conditions that often push offenses to lean on the ground game. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum headline the Rams’ backfield, while Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet carry the load for the Seahawks.\n\nWith first place at stake, key skill players potentially sidelined and slick field conditions in play, expect both defenses to prioritize limiting explosive plays and force long, methodical drives. A slower tempo paired with two elite defensive units points toward a tightly contested game that struggles to reach the projected point total.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Kings (14-10-9) wrap up a three-game road trip as they visit the Tampa Bay Lightning (18-12-3) at Benchmark International Arena.\n\nEntering tonight, both teams are looking to get back on track. Tampa Bay arrives after consecutive losses to the New York Islanders and Florida, while Los Angeles has dropped four straight. Defense has been a common strength, with both clubs ranking inside the top five in goals allowed. Tampa Bay sits fifth and Los Angeles second, with each allowing 2.6 goals per game. That combined average of 5.2 goals comes in slightly below tonight’s projected total.\n\nDefense has not been the lone driver of Tampa Bay’s success this season. Through 33 games, the Lightning are averaging 3.2 goals per game, eighth-best in the NHL. Strong play at both ends of the ice has helped Tampa Bay post a plus-19 goal differential, which ranks fourth in the league.\n\nLos Angeles, meanwhile, has leaned heavily on its defensive structure, but its offense has lagged behind. The Kings enter with the NHL’s 30th-ranked scoring offense and will need to find some consistency to keep the losing skid from growing. With two elite defensive units on the ice, expect scoring chances to be limited and the pace to stay controlled in a low-scoring matchup.",

    "description": "BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team explains why there are three NFL matches on Christmas Day this year",
    "fullText": "The NFL has held at least one match on Christmas Day every year since 2020, with three 25 December fixtures scheduled in 2025.\n\nIt has previously held matches on the holiday, but between 1989 and 2019 would only occasionally schedule regular-season games on that date. This only tended to take place in years when Christmas Day would fall on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday.\n\nEarlier this season, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that from this year onwards there would be three games held every year on 25 December.\n\nSince 2021, two or three games have taken place on Christmas Day each year, with this year being a three-game day, much like in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAll three Christmas Day matches are between teams that have strong rivalries.\n\nThe Washington Commanders will host the Dallas Cowboys in the first game of the day, with the Minnesota Vikings playing at home against the Detroit Lions in the second.\n\nIn the third and final game of the day the Kansas City Chiefs face the Denver Broncos.\n\nWhile all three games kick off on Christmas Day in America, because of time zone differences the Chiefs-Broncos game will actually start in the early hours of 26 December at 01:15 GMT.\n\nStreaming site Netflix will show the first two games, as it did in 2024. The third match will be shown on Prime Video.\n\nIn 1971, the NFL held its first two Christmas Day matches following the merger between the American Football League and National Football League in the previous year.\n\nThose two matches were play-off games and the unpopularity of the decision to host the Christmas Day double-header led to an 18-year gap before matches were played again on 25 December.\n\nThursday, 25 December 18:00: Dallas Cowboys @ Washington Commanders\n\nThursday, 25 December 21:30: Detroit Lions @ Minnesota Vikings\n\nFriday, 26 December 01:15: Denver Broncos @ Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy are there NFL matches on Thanksgiving?\n\nWhy do some NFL rookies struggle in their second year?\n\nWhat are the differences between NFL wide receivers and tight ends?\n\nHow does studying game film work in American football?",

    "description": "Rams vs. Seahawks predictions and NFL picks for Thursday Night Football. Los Angeles stays a step ahead of Seattle.",
    "fullText": "The top spot in the NFC is on the line when the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks face off in a heavyweight Thursday Night Football matchup.\n\nMy Rams vs Seahawks predictions and NFL picks side with the visiting Rams, who have a lot of betting trends on their side.\n\nKickoff is set for 8:15 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in beautiful Seattle, with the game airing on Prime Video on Thursday, December 18.\n\nRams vs Seahawks best bet: Rams -1 (-105)\n\nI like backing betting trends, so it’s near impossible to overlook the Los Angeles Rams in this spot at a reasonable number.\n\nLos Angeles has been one of the most reliable late-season bets in the NFL, compiling a 17–3 ATS record in their last 20 games played in the month of December. That trend has continued this year, with the Rams starting December 2–0 while piling up 86 total points against Arizona and Detroit, surpassing 500 yards of offense in both games. They’re peaking at the right time.\n\nThey’ve also dominated the spread in matchups against the Seattle Seahawks, covering 11 of the last 14 meetings, including five straight at Lumen Field. That level of consistency against a division opponent is hard to dismiss, particularly in a building that’s traditionally been difficult for visitors.\n\nRoad performance has also been a strength. Los Angeles has gone 11–2 ATS in its last 13 road games and owns a 17–5 ATS mark overall since December 1 of last season. Whether home or away, this team has shown an ability to travel and execute in high-leverage spots.\n\nEven setting trends aside, there are reasons for skepticism on the Seattle side.\n\nThe Seahawks escaped with a narrow win over the Philip Rivers-led Colts last week despite being nearly two-touchdown favorites, and while they continue to accumulate wins, Sam Darnold’s play has cooled off. It’s also very fair to question his confidence in standalone, high-pressure games after he completely melted down at the end of last season with the Vikings.\n\nThat concern is amplified by the matchup itself. The Rams are 3–0 against Darnold since the start of last season and forced him into costly mistakes, including a four-interception performance just over a month ago.\n\nTrends alone don’t decide games, but when form, matchup history, and quarterback results all point in the same direction, they deserve attention. On a short week in Seattle, the data suggests the Rams are once again positioned to continue their strong December run.\n\nIn addition to being 3-0 vs Darnold since the beginning of last season, Los Angeles has owned the Seahawks, going 11-3 ATS against them in the last 14 matchups. Look for Kyren Williams to add to his 13 total TDs vs. a Seattle defense that's allowed the most receptions in the NFL to opposing running backs.\n\nKyren Williams anytime touchdown\n\nKyren Williams Over 1.5 receptions\n\nJSN has reached the 100-yard mark in an amazing eight of his last 10 games, including going for 105 vs. the Rams on November 15. Los Angeles has allowed the sixth-most receiving yards to the wide receiver position this season.\n\nKyren Williams anytime touchdown\n\nKyren Williams Over 1.5 receptions\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba Over 95.5 receiving yards\n\nThe Rams have hit their stride during the stretch run of the season with back-to-back wins where they’ve dropped 40+ points and 500+ yards. I’m not going to stand in front of that vs Darnold, who can’t be trusted in big spots like this.\n\nWith the Rams being 17-3 ATS in their last 20 games played in December while also being 11-3 ATS in their last 14 games vs the Seahawks, I’ll happily side with them to cover.\n\nThe Under also profiles well in a matchup between two of the league’s top defenses. These teams rank second and third in points allowed and played to a 21–19 game in November that was tracking even lower before late touchdowns. Unless short fields or defensive scores swing the script, the metrics point toward a lower-scoring game.\n\nSpread: Los Angeles -1.5 (+100) | Seattle +1.5 (-122)\n\nMoneyline: Los Angeles -106 | Seattle -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 42 (-110) | Under 42.5 (-110)\n\nThe Rams are 17-3 ATS in their last 20 games played in December.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe College Football Playoff will feature plenty of great future NFL talent with the 12 teams making the field. While it might not be surprising Ohio State's loaded team dominates the pro prospects, 18 of Sporting News' 32 first-round projections in all are tied to CFP action.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead with five such picks, with Georgia, Oregon, Texas A&M, Alabama and Miami also in line to have multiple selections on Day 1. Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas Tech get on the board, too. That's incredible representation from three-fourths of the CFP teams, which also account for all three QBs and four of the first five overall picks.\n\nHere is the Sporting News' latest NFL Mock Draft ahead of the 2025 College Football playoff.\n\nMORE: Bills, 49ers rise as Packers fade in latest SN Power Rankings\n\n(No. 1-18 order courtesy of Tankathon; No. 19-32 from Week 16 playoff picture)\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Giants, if they stay at No. 1 overall and don't trade out of this pick for a team wanting a quarterback, should consider taking Reese as an all-around force to fix a lot of their defensive issues away from a rather productive pass rush.\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (6-5, 225 pounds)\n\nThe Raiders can't be happy with their quarterback situation post-Derek Carr, with Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett screaming that they need to go after a true, strong, accurate franchise passer solution. Mendoza looks the part with his arm and intangibles, two things that should appeal to the influence of Tom Brady.\n\nMORE: How Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman over Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin\n\nRueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-3, 275 pounds)\n\nThe Titans also don't need a QB after taking Cam Ward No. 1 overall last year, but they can go back to the Hurricanes program to get the game-changing pass-rusher they desperately need for their latest defensive reboot.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State (6-2, 200 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to stop messing around at wide receiver and give either Shedeur Sanders or a different starting quarterback a true go-to all over the field, both in the slot and outside, in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jaxon Smith-Njigba vein, only lacking the hyphen.\n\nDante Moore, QB, Oregon (6-3, 206 pounds)\n\nMoore has the leadership and intangibles to handle being the next shot at a franchise QB in New York as well as the savvy and strong arm. They also need to get a real long-term option after the Justin Fields flop.\n\nTroy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Network\n\nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (6-0, 214 pounds)\n\nThe Cardinals saw the breakdown early of pending free agent James Conner and have had an unhealthy mess of a committee trying to replace him. This may seem like a luxury pick for a team that has a lot of needs, but they can get some tackle help later and Love can be a game-changer for restoring balance and expanding the explosiveness.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC (5-11, 195 pounds)\n\nThe Saints, should they stick with Tyler Shough at QB, need to give him more weapons after depleting the receiving crops beyond Chris Olave. Kellen Moore can have some visions of Lemon being the DeVonta Smith to Olave's A.J. Brown should Shough show big improvement.\n\nMORE: Sporting News' expert predictions for 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State (6-0, 205 pounds)\n\nThe Commanders need to get younger and more impactful in their defense after things fell apart in their secondary and around Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Downs is a terrific do-everything hybrid who would be set up to make a lot of big plays in Dan Quinn's scheme.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson (6-3, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Bengals need to keep beefing up their defensive line to pull out of being atrocious against the run and it doesn't hurt to have some of Woods' inside pass-rush juice to support their end rotation.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee (6-0, 193 pounds)\n\nThe Rams know that cornerback coverage is their biggest weakness on an otherwise loaded roster, with some retooling needed. They keep up the strong defensive pick momentum with the nice-sized, tough McCoy.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT, Miami (6-6, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Dolphins need to get more offensive line help for wherever they go at QB and they can stay in town to get a long-term all-around rock in Mauigoa.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon (6-3, 245 pounds)\n\nThe Chiefs need to be feeling the imminence of Travis Kelce's retirement and can step right into drafting his dynamic go-to receiver replacement to boost Patrick Mahomes again once he returns from his torn ACL.\n\nMORE: Why it's not time to announce the Chiefs dynasty over yet\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Vikings will need to keep working on their secondary with some contract issues ahead and Delane is not that far off in battling McCoy for the status as the best corner in this class.\n\nDavid Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech (6-3, 250 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys will go to work on replacing Micah Parsons' pass rush production with this Lubbock chess piece who has all the moves to get to the quarterback as well as unique dropback coverage ability for the position.\n\nMORE: Full list of stadiums hosting 2025 College Football Playoff games\n\nKeldric Faulk, EDGE, Auburn (6-6, 285 pounds)\n\nThe Ravens should love this complete outside linebacker option who can provide power vs. the run as well as needed pass-rush juice.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Panthers have been feeling the void at linebacker for a while after it was once a strength and GM Dan Morgan should have intrigue to go for his former position with Styles, a versatile talent who makes a lot of plays everywhere along with Reese.\n\nCashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M (6-2, 248 pounds)\n\nHowell can give the Lions the needed strong complementary pass rusher for Aidan Hutchinson to relieve their secondary coverage a lot more next season.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson (5-11, 180 pounds)\n\nThe Jets, after going QB with Moore earlier in this mock, can get their Sauce Gardner replacement with the pick acquired in that trade with Terrell, brother of Falcons star A.J.\n\nMORE: Latest news on QBs entering NCAA transfer portal\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah (6-6, 302 pounds)\n\nThe Texans have gotten surprising returns from rookie Aireontay Ersery and the rest of their rebuilt line but should be in the market to boost pass protection and run blocking at either right tackle or guard with Fano.\n\nT.J. Parker, EDGE, Clemson (6-3, 265 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys shouldn't mind doubling up on pass-rush help here with Parker and Bailey, as Parker can provide more traditional burst and finishing moves from defensive end to help Quinnen Williams in Matt Eberflus' front four.\n\nCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State (6-3, 195 pounds)\n\nThe 49ers seem ready to cut ties with injured Brandon Aiyuk, which means they will need to find a dynamic speedy big target for Brock Purdy to better take advantage of his ace deep passing. Tate would be a natural fit with George Kittle and Jauan Jennings downfield.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 25 Heisman Trophy winners since 2000\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State (6-3, 326 pounds)\n\nThe Bills have been terrible against the run and McDonald is a natural and physically overwhelming run-stopper for the Buckeyes, shooting up boards with his dominant play fron the regular season.\n\nCaleb Banks, DT, Florida (6-6, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Chargers also could bolster their interior to help their front seven in multiple ways and Banks has the right kind of power and pop for Jesse Minter.\n\nBrandon Cisse, CB, South Carolina (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Seahawks didn't trade pending free agent Riq Woolen and will need to find their strong replacement outside to support Devon Witherpoon. Cissee can be seamless in the schme of Mike Macdonald.\n\nMORE: Picks against the spread for all 35 bowl games\n\nR Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma (6-2, 249 pounds)\n\nThe Buccaneers should covet this explosive pass-rusher built to thrive in Todd Bowles' scheme and help restore their old strength on the second level.\n\nTy Simpson, QB, Alabama (6-2, 208 pounds)s\n\nThe Steelers should be in the market for a starting QB early if Aaron Rodgers retires and Simpson's brand of pocket passing would provide plenty of promise.\n\nOlaivavega Ioane, G, Penn State (6-4, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Eagles have had issues at right guard this season and Ioane would be the easy upgrade coming from State College to Philly. sliding over from his left side position in college to start right away and upgrade over Tyler Steen.\n\nCaleb Lomu, OT, Utah (6-6, 304 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to rebuild their offensive line right up there with getting more reliable receivers and Lomu would be a good initial building block, going not long after teammate Fano.\n\nChristen Miller, DT, Georgia (6-3, 305 pounds)\n\nThe Bears need to work on their interior for Dennis Allen's front and Miller would be ideal to help them with their own run-stopping problems.\n\nKC Concepcion, WR, Texas A&M (5-11, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Patriots should love what this dynamic slot can do as the ideal fit in Josh McDaniels' offense to make big plays in the open field after the catch and upgrade over Pop Douglas and other complements to Stefon Diggs.\n\nMORE: Updated list of every college coaching change for 2026\n\nKadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama (6-7, 366 pounds)\n\nThe Rams can again think more about the near future with this second first-rounder with Proctor looking solid as their future long-term tackle on either the right or left side.\n\nC.J. Allen, LB, Georgia (6-1, 235 pounds)\n\nThe Broncos need to cover more ground defensively on the second level and Allen would provide that typical Bulldogs athlete who can get around well vs. run and in coverage.",

    "fullText": "The Patriots suffered a defeat against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, but their chances of securing the AFC East title remain promising.\n\nNew England still has three regular season games remaining, playing the Baltimore Ravens, New York Jets and Miami Dolphins.\n\nBrad Gagnon from Bleacher Report outlined the Patriots’ ideal scenario for the remainder of the regular season.\n\n“Beat the Ravens on the road in Week 16 to show some much-needed resiliency, then clinch the AFC East title by taking care of the division-rival Jets and/or Dolphins to close out the regular season,” Gagnon wrote on Wednesday.\n\nThe Patriots can secure a playoff spot with a win or a tie against the Ravens this Sunday. However, New England will need to wait for the outcome of the last two weeks, which will be determined by division opponents, to see if it can clinch the AFC East title.\n\nNew England currently has an 11-3 record, while Buffalo is at 10-4. If the Patriots win their remaining games, they will secure the AFC East title. However, after losing to Buffalo in Week 15, they lost the head-to-head tiebreaker, as the Patriots and Bills split their matchups this season.\n\nThe next tiebreaker is based on wins against division opponents. The Patriots have a 3-1 record, while the Bills are 3-2 following their loss to the Dolphins.\n\nEven if the Patriots lose to the Ravens but defeat the Jets and Dolphins, New England will still claim the AFC East title, even if the Bills win all their remaining games.\n\nPatriots-Ravens Injury Report: Lamar Jackson Among Starters Missing On Both Sides",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce entered the 2025-’26 NFL season looking to win a fourth Super Bowl with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, but it all fell apart in Week 15. In the fourth quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers, Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL. The Chiefs lost 16-13 and were eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nIt was a very disappointing season for Kansas City as the offense never found a consistent rhythm, even with Mahomes and Kelce playing really well. Following the game, the Chiefs’ tight end refused to speak to the media, citing that it wasn’t the right time.\n\nNow, Kelce has broken his silence on Mahomes’ brutal ACL injury, while sending a possible hint on his future with the Chiefs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jason and Travis Kelce released their “New Heights” podcast after Week 15. Many were waiting to hear what the Kansas City tight end was going to say about Mahomes, but they didn’t expect the possible hint about his future.\n\n“[Patrick Mahomes] is a fearless, fearless warrior when it comes to this football thing,” Kelce said. “He’s gonna make sure that he comes back stronger than ever. Hopefully, the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible. I know right now it’s kind of right around that, Week 1 or the beginning of the season next year. I know he’s going to be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs as soon as possible.”\n\nKelce’s decision to say “the Chiefs” instead of “we” has stirred up some discussion on social media that he has already made up his mind about retirement. In the midst of a tough 2025 NFL season, it is not shocking to hear that Kelce might have already made up his mind after coming off a loss in the Super Bowl.\n\nIf so, this means that Kelce has caught his final pass from Mahomes, as Gardner Minshew appears to be the starting quarterback for the rest of the NFL season. Based on Kelce’s comments, it seems like these will be his final three games in the NFL before entering retirement as well.\n\nFranciso Lindor Traded to LA Dodgers, and 4 Other Destinations Following Weird Trump Rumor\n\n‘We’re going no matter what’: Sirens dismiss Olympic rink worries\n\nAlex Bregman Free Agency Rumors Link Him to Surprise NL West Team in 2025",

    "fullText": "Jason Kelce and his younger brother, Travis Kelce, discussed the possibility of Jason coming out of retirement on the Wednesday, Dec. 17 episode of their New Heights podcast\n\nJason told Travis that he won't be returning to the Philadelphia Eagles because he has a \"loose\" bone stuck in his elbow joint that keeps him from bending his elbow\n\nJason retired from the Eagles in 2024 after 13 years in the NFL\n\nJason Kelce isn’t looking to come out of retirement anytime soon.\n\nThe 38-year-old retired NFL star hung up his cleats after 13 years with the Philadelphia Eagles in March 2024, moving on to serve as a commentator on Monday Night Countdown.\n\nOn the Wednesday, Dec. 17 episode of his and brother Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast, the subject of Jason coming out of retirement and returning to his role as a football center came up when the brothers were discussing Indianapolis Colts quarterback Philip Rivers' return to the NFL at age 44.\n\n“What other retired player should get back out there?” Travis, 36, asked, before noting, “I mean, I know a guy still trying to prove his athleticism and trying to dunk.”\n\nBut Jason quickly shut down the idea that he would come out retirement, explaining that he has a loose bone — which he calls a \"body\" — moving around his arm.\n\n“Travis, I can't bend my elbow right now. I got a loose body,” Jason said. “I can't even touch my head right now because I got a loose body stuck in my f------ elbow joint.”\n\nAccording to the University of Colorado Anschutz sports medicine department, “Loose bodies can happen in your elbow which is small pieces of bone or cartilage that have broken off and are lying or floating free within the joint. This can make it difficult to bend or rotate the joint.”\n\nTravis wasn’t interested in his older brother’s reasoning, saying, “Well, go and get that s--- cleaned out, Jason.”\n\nAnd the father of four revealed, “I'm trying to avoid surgery, Travis!”\n\nTravis wasn’t deterred adding, “We gotta get some rehab going. Are we not rehabbing?”\n\n“There's not a rehab!” Jason argued. “There's just a piece of cartilage that's floating around in there, and it's stuck in my joint. I usually, I can find it and then, like, push it out of the joint and it goes back to being fine. I can't do it right now. It's, like, stuck somewhere. I don't know if it's in the back or in the front, but it isn't leaving.”\n\nAfter Travis suggested Jason “go get an MRI” to help repair the injury, Jason gave his final word, saying, “Anyways, it's not gonna be me.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe subject of Travis’ potential retirement was not discussed during the podcast appearance, though Jason did speak on it during this week’s Monday Night Countdown.\n\n\"In my opinion, to nail that decision, you gotta step away from the game for a little bit,\" Jason said about his brother's retirement plans on Monday, Dec. 15.\n\n\"Play these last three games, enjoy them with your teammates, enjoy them with your coaches... and then let it sink in. It'll come to you with time. There are so many emotions with this game right after a season, especially with the way this one's been,\" he continued.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14, officially ending their playoff chances. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes also tore his ACL during the game, putting him out of commission for months as he recovers from surgery.",

    "description": "Tua Tagovailoa's late 2025 benching is an expensive quarterback proposition for the Dolphins in 2026 unless they can trade him in the 2026 offense.",
    "fullText": "What's next for benched Tua Tagovailoa? Dolphins QB's contract, trade options cloud NFL future originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins will be missing the AFC playoffs for a second consecutive season under Mike McDaniel. While the offensive-minded coach is trying to get off the hot seat with his team eliminated from contention at 6-8, McDaniel has benched starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for poor performance in Week 16.\n\nThe Dolphins had rallied from a 1-6 start to go 5-1 with Tagovailoa at QB, but then were crushed by the Steelers, 28-15, to end Week 15 on Monday night. Although Tagovailoa didn't play well overall in that game,  it was far from his worst outing of another disappointing season. He still threw for 253 yards with 2 TDs and an INT to post a strong 113.2 passer rating.\n\nBut beyond Tagovailoa's play, there's something that has rubbed McDaniel the wrong way. Through his 14 starts, Tagovailoa still leads the NFL with 15 interceptions, a career-high total. The timing was just right for McDaniel to dive into full evaluation mode with rookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers, who will start for the Bengals at home on Sunday.\n\nTagovailoa's benching so late says the Dolphins are desperate to cut ties with him, despite how much money he's owed and uncertainty on whether McDaniel will return in 2026. Here's why Tagovailoa's near future isn't looking so good:\n\nComplete timeline of Tua Tagovailoa's injury history\n\nInside look at Tua Tagovailoa's family tree\n\nWhere does Tua Tagovailoa rank among Alabama's greatest players ever?\n\nTua Tagovailoa's net worth, from career earnings to endorsements and more\n\nTagovailoa is playing on the second year of the four-year, $212 million contract extension, his post-rookie deal. He is owed $56 million in guaranteed money as part of his 2026 compensation. If on the Dolphins' roster next March 15, that jumps up to $3 million more guaranteed from his 2027 salary.\n\nThe Dolphins, at his contract stands without a forced restructure, are stuck taking a massive hit with the release of Tagovailoa. They stand to eat $99 million-plus in dead money, either over one or two years, with a cut in 2026.\n\nThe Dolphins would not be smart to release Tagovailoa, so they would need to think a lot more about trading himif there are no more plans to start him. Trading Tagovailoa would reduce the dead cap hit to $45.2 million with $11.2 in cap money recouped. With a designated June 1 trade, that dead cap cost would be spread over two years with $43 million saved toward the 2026 cap.\n\nMORE:Which NFL coaches are on the hot seat?\n\nTagovailoa should have some interest in the outside market. For that to happen, there will need to be a new adjusted contract down to a one-year prove-it deal. Unless McDaniel is let go, it would be difficult to see Tagovailoa playing for the Dolphins in '26.\n\nThe Raiders and Jets are the two QB-neediest teams in the NFL. Then come teams such as the Steelers, who may see Aaron Rodgers retire after one season in Pittsburgh. The Saints and Browns are not yet locked into their respective non-first-round rookies, Tyler Shough and Shedeur Sanders. The Cardinals also seem headed to having a void after moving on from Kyler Murray, but they are getting some good play from Tua's former backup, Jacoby Brissett.\n\nMORE: Tyreek Hill's cryptic social media message hints at Miami departure\n\nGoing deeper, he can be a contingency plan for the Colts and Chiefs (Daniel Jones and Patrick Mahomes injuries), Vikings (J.J. McCarthy) or Rams (Matthew Stafford successor). Then again, Jones and Marcus Mariota might have more appeal as free agents and the draft should offer at least three first-round quarterbacks.\n\nWhoever takes on Tagovailoa would be taking a shot on damaged goods at still a high price in relation to how he's played in an uber-regressive 2025 season. He's headed to needing to reboot his career as a backup, following the suit of Mariota and Jameis Winston. Unfortunately, his volatility and injury-proneness say he might be more headed the way of the next Carson Wentz, a hard-fading QB with little upside.",

    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles rumor from ESPN reveals possibility of offseason A.J. Brown trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles will have a decision to make on wide receiver A.J. Brown during the offseason.\n\nBrown is unhappy with how things have gone on offense this season and he has made that publicly known. That's something the Eagles can't love, as it draws negative attention and could create problems in the locker room.\n\nThat has led many to wonder if the Eagles could trade Brown during the offseason, and ESPN's Jeremy Fowler is hearing that it's a possibility.\n\n\"I have several candidates, but let's start with A.J. Brown. The weekly concerns about Brown's messaging — from sonnets to soundbites — must be taxing on Philadelphia's locker room, even if players understand the receiver's frustration due to the limitations of the Eagles' passing attack,\" Fowler said. \"Several executives I spoke to believe the Eagles could look to move Brown, who's 28 and still has prime years left.\"\n\nAccording to Over The Cap, the Eagles would incur a $43.4 million dead cap hit in 2026 if they trade Brown before June 1. The post-June 1 trade number is more palatable at $16.3 million.\n\nIs it worth jettisoning Brown and taking on that dead cap hit in order to not have him on the team and complaining publicly anymore?\n\nWe would say no, especially with the Eagles having a huge hole to fill in their offense if they do trade him, but never say never in the NFL.\n\nAs far as compensation is concerned, we could see Philly getting a first-round pick for Brown's services, but no worse than a second-rounder.\n\nWith that pick, combined with the eight projected selections the Eagles have, they will have ample opportunity to add a replacement for Brown to pair with DeVonta Smith, who will turn into Philly's No. 1 if Brown gets traded.\n\nWe've seen the Eagles bite the bullet with dead money to unload one of their players before, so we shouldn't rule out the same happening with Brown.\n\nRaiders rumor details Las Vegas' likely exit strategy with Pete Carroll\n\nJerry Jones highly critical of Matt Eberflus, making his seat even hotter\n\nDetails behind Jets' problems with Allen Lazard revealed after WR's release\n\nZac Taylor, Duke Tobin get Bengals job security update from beat writer",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals suffered another blowout loss on Sunday. This time, it was not to an NFC West opponent. It was a 40-20 road loss to the Houston Texans. They have now lost six games in a row and 11 of their last 12.\n\nAnd in new NFL power rankings for Week 16 by USA TODAY's Nate Davis, they have fallen, which is understandable.\n\nWhere do the Cardinals rank this week?\n\nThe Cardinals now are No. 25, two behind where they were a week ago.\n\nTE Trey McBride and WR Michael Wilson are the only NFL players with at least 40 receptions since Week 11 (both have 44 during that span). Despite all their efforts, the Cards are 0-5 during that stretch.\n\nWe can add to that. Jacoby Brissett has 18 touchdown passes in nine starts. However, they are 1-5.\n\nThey have played six games since head coach Jonathan Gannon said that Brissett would have remained the starter even if Kyler Murray were healthy. They are 0-6 with a minus-95 point differential.\n\nSo it's a weird situation. Brissett's numbers look impressive on the surface. He is getting the ball to McBride and Wilson, who has gotten looks as the No. 1 receiver with Marvin Harrison Jr. missing four of the last five games. Those are good things, they also happen while the Cardinals are trailing by multiple scores. They have lost by three or more scores in four of their last six games.\n\nWhile they play the 5-9 Atlanta Falcons this week and the 4-10 Cincinnati Bengals next week, it still is hard to believe that the Cardinals will win any games the rest of the season.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "One NFL analyst weighed in on Phillip Rivers' performance in the Colts' loss to Seattle.",
    "fullText": "ESPN's Ben Solak doesn't believe that the Indianapolis Colts should start Phillip Rivers at quarterback over these final three games.\n\n\"After one game of Rivers, albeit against a great defense without two starting tackles, I'd play Leonard if and when he's healthy,\" Solak wrote recently. \"I'd play Anthony Richardson Sr. if and when he's healthy.\"\n\nSo what makes Solak feel this way?\n\nIn short, he feels that a key portion of Shane Steichen's playbook was too limited on Sunday with Rivers under center.\n\nAs Solak noted, the Colts' offense leads the NFL entering Week 16 in yards per play from under center. However, with Rivers at quarterback, Indianapolis ran only one such play against Seattle.\n\nWith Rivers' limited mobility, the Colts relied on pistol and shotgun formations.\n\nFrom under center, the Colts have had a very strong running game this season and a very versatile offense. From pistol or shotgun, those elements became more limited.\n\n\"Let me emphasize that point: This was, and remains, the best under-center team in football,\" wrote Solak. \"The running game, in particular, is a strength.\"\n\nSolak added, \"The Colts are highly versatile from under center. They operate a wide range of concepts with a wider set of tags and motions to those runs. With every week, they have changed.\"\n\nWhile Rivers' knowledge of Steichen's offense and his decision-making provided stability at the quarterback position, there was also a lack of explosive plays from the Colts' offense.\n\nUtilizing the quick passing game often, Solak mentions that the Colts had only two pass attempts of 20-plus yards the entire game. The play-action game was also limited as well.\n\nThe caveat to all of this, which Solak made sure to point out, was that the Colts were up against a very good Seattle defense. This, of course, factored into some of the results.\n\nSolak also says that Rivers' performance exceeded his expectations. But what Solak also saw on Sunday from the Colts was a limited playbook.\n\nSteichen has already announced that Rivers will be the Colts' starting quarterback against San Francisco this week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Why one NFL analyst wouldn't start Phillip Rivers at quarterback",

    "fullText": "Despite loss to Josh Allen and Bills, can Drake Maye still challenge for NFL MVP? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots fell back to Earth with their toughest loss of the season. It wasn’t just that they couldn’t afford to lose to the Buffalo Bills, their main divisional rival, but blowing a 21-point lead also raised questions about their status as true contenders.\n\nThe Patriots had dominated with one of the easiest schedules in the league. They even took down the Bills in their first meeting of the season, and they looked poised to make a statement again on Sunday before Josh Allen went berserk in the second half.\n\nMore than that, that loss may have also cost Drake Maye a shot at MVP. When asked about the game, however, he only talked about how bouncing back from this setback will be the actual challenge now:\n\n“Move on to next week and learn from it,\" Maye said, per NFL.com. \"It was a long stretch where we were feeling good about ourselves. Now it's about responding from losing to a good team.\"\n\nJosh Allen made a statement and proved to be the best quarterback in the league right now. He made big play after big play with a three-touchdown performance to bring his team back to seal a 35-31 win. Even so, Maye still has a chance to win MVP.\n\nThe Pats are still in control of their destiny, and at 11-3, they can be the No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the AFC. They will close out the season by facing the Baltimore Ravens before back-to-back matchups with eliminated divisional rivals, the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins. At worst, they should be able to win two of those games.\n\nDrake Maye is leading the league with a completion percentage of 70.9 percent. He has thrown for 3,567 yards and 23 touchdowns to go along with just seven interceptions and a passer rating of 109.1. He also has 362 rushing yards and four scores on the ground.\n\nOf course, Allen’s numbers aren’t half bad, either. He’s thrown for 3,276 yards, 25 touchdowns, and ten picks while completing 70 percent of his passes, all while also logging 535 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns.\n\nAllen’s numbers are slightly better, and he’s the reigning MVP and one of the faces of the league.\n\nBut if Maye leads the Patriots to a 14-win season after winning just four games last year, it’ll be almost impossible not to give him the award.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has the largest lead of the season in NFL MVP odds thanks to a slipup Sunday from the New England Patriots' Drake Maye.\n\nStafford would tie Y.A.Tittle and Rich Gannon as the oldest first-time NFL MVP (37).\n\nMaye was just held under 200 yards passing for the first time all year.\n\nOnly one top-eight finisher in last year’s MVP voting is in the race for this year’s award.\n\nStafford and Maye have been locked in a seemingly two-horse race to win the MVP trophy for more than a month.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Maye was installed as a -120 favorite, while Stafford was back around +120. The 37-year-old, 14 years the senior of Maye, reclaimed a narrow lead one week later, leading into a decisive Week 15.\n\nStafford and the Rams took down the visiting Detroit Lions, 41-34, behind their QB’s 368 yards and two touchdowns against one interception.\n\nMaye and the Pats got off to a hot start against the AFC East rival Buffalo Bills, surging ahead to a 21-0 lead in the second quarter and a 24-7 halftime score. However, their second-half collapse allowed the visiting Bills to steal a 35-31 victory.\n\nMaye was held below 200 passing yards for the first time all season. He finished with 155 passing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and an interception, while the Pats’ winning streak ended at 10 games.\n\nStafford’s shortest odds, -300 at BetMGM, translate to a 75% implied chance to win the award. Maye’s +380 at FanDuel equals a 20.8% implied chance.\n\nThe Rams finish their season by visiting the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons and hosting the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nThe Pats' three-game run includes matchups at the Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets and against the Miami Dolphins.\n\nWhile it seems hard to believe that anyone other than Stafford or Maye could win the MVP, the reigning award-winner is doing his best to surprise.\n\nBuoyed by the comeback victory on Sunday, Bills QB Josh Allen is down to around +500 at the top online sportsbooks. He had 193 passing yards and three touchdowns last weekend and is now fourth in passing TDs, sixth in QBR, and eighth in passing yards.\n\nThe closest challenger is Denver Broncos QB Bo Nix, although his lowest odds are +7,500 at bet365. That gives him just a 1.3% implied chance to take home the award.\n\nJust below Nix is Jordan Love, whose Green Bay Packers fell in Mile High on Sunday. Love is anywhere from +8,000 to +15,000 despite leading the NFL in QBR and ranking fifth in touchdowns and seventh in passing yards.\n\nThe only other player who seemingly has a chance is Sam Darnold. The long shot is +10,000 across the board as he prepares to face Stafford and the Rams on Thursday Night Football.\n\nThe 2025 NFL MVP odds race is nothing like the one a year ago.\n\nWhile Allen is still in the mix after winning last year’s award, none of the other top eight finishers a year ago are in with a shot at the 2025 MVP. Justin Herbert, who finished ninth, is about seventh in odds (anywhere from +10,000 to +15,000), and Darnold, who was 10th last year, is sixth in current odds.\n\nAssuming a quarterback wins the MVP - which seems inevitable - it will mark 13 years since a player at a different position took the award. The last to do so was running back Adrian Peterson.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Ohio State's Carnell Tate gets massive comparison to 42-TD NFL star who won national title originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes continue to be a wide receiver factory.\n\nTheir latest developmental project may just be star wideout Carnell Tate. Through nearly three seasons thus far in Columbus, Tate has continued to improve leaps and bounds, catching the attention of NFL Draft analysts and other football personnel.\n\nOne of those is ESPN's Matt Miller who confidently gave Tate an eye-popping NFL comp: Minnesota Vikings star wideout Justin Jefferson.\n\nMiller was particularly impressed with the way both men play their spots when it comes to spreading the field alongside their ability to generate yards after contact (YAC).\n\n“I know, I know… this sounds wild. But it’s on point when comparing Tate to what Jefferson was at LSU – not what he is doing now in the NFL. Both are 6-foot-3 and around 200 pounds,\" Miller wrote. \"They each excelled as route runners while also being dominant on 50-50 balls thanks to vertical skills and body-adjustment ability. “I’m not predicting Tate will take the NFL by storm and become a top player as quickly as Jefferson did, but their skill sets are very similar when evaluating where they were entering the draft.”\n\nJefferson has caught 42 touchdowns thus far through nearly six NFL seasons. His best season statistically came in 2022 when the Vikings won the NFC North with a 13-4 record. Jefferson's season saw him hit a career-high 1,809 yards while catching eight touchdowns.\n\nThe Vikings would go on to lose in the NFC Wild Card Round to the New York Giants at home, 31-24.\n\nAlthough Tate has more time to grow and develop into a big-game receiver at the next level, it's a telling sign to see that those in the know see immediate benefit for whichever team decides to draft him.",

    "fullText": "Rams vs. Seahawks prediction, odds, pick for Week 16 Thursday Night Football appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nFollowing a wild week of upsets and new storylines in Week 15, Week 16 of the NFL season will begin with this upcoming divisional tilt on Thursday Night Football. The Los Angeles Rams (11-3) will visit the Seattle Seahawks (11-3) as the two sides battle for the top of the NFC West. Check our NFL odds series for the Rams-Seahawks prediction and pick.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams continue their run atop the NFC standings with their latest 41-34 win over the Detroit Lions in Week 15. This tilt against the Seahawks will be their most critical remaining game in deciding the division, but they’ve already secured their berth to the playoffs.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks beat the Indianapolis Colts 18-16 in Week 15, marking their fourth-consecutive win. They’ve won eight of their last nine games with their lone loss during that stretch coming at the hands of Los Angeles. They’ll hope to even the rivalry as the home underdogs.\n\nNFL Odds courtesy of DraftKings\n\n*practice status as of 12/15/2025*\n\nLos Angeles: WR Jordan Whittington, Limited (back) / OL Alaric Jackson, Limited (ankle) / DE Braden Fiske, DNP (ankle) / WR Davante Adams, DNP (hamstring) / S Jaylen McCollough, DNP (illness)\n\nSeattle: LB DeMarcus Lawrence, Limited (quad) / WR Cody White, Limited (abdomen) / OT Charles Cross, DNP (hamstring)\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are 5-2 at home. The Los Angeles Rams are 5-2 on the road.\n\nThe Seahawks are 10-4 ATS overall, 4-3 ATS at home. The Rams are 10-4 ATS overall, 5-2 ATS on the road.\n\nThe Rams are 3-1 against NFC West opponents. The Seahawks are 2-2.\n\nThe Rams are 7-3 outright, 8-2 ATS in their last 10 games against the Seahawks.\n\nBoth teams are 7-2 ATS in their last nine games.\n\nSeattle is 0-5 ATS in their last five home games against the Rams.\n\nThe Rams are 11-2 ATS in their last 13 games on the road.\n\nThe most significant tidbit for either team will be the potential loss of Rams’ WR Davante Adams, who went down with a hamstring injury in Week 15. He leads the NFL in receiving touchdowns (14) and has been an integral part of the added success for QB Matthew Stafford and the busiest WR in football Puka Nacua. The injury to Adams will certainly benefit opposing defenses as they can key their efforts in on Nacua, but it was notably TE Colby Parkinson with a career day against the Lions. With all the weapons around him, Matthew Stafford and this offense are poised for a deep run in the playoffs.\n\nThe Seahawks, who fell to the Rams 22-19 five weeks ago, should rest easy knowing they lost by just a field goal despite QB Sam Darnold’s four interceptions. Their defense played well for the most part given how much time they spent on the field, so this second game at home should see a better showing from the Seattle offense. WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba is making his case for the NFC’s best offensive player as his connection with Sam Darnold has been great to watch all season.\n\nThis Rams’ defense, while solid all season, had a much more lenient effort against the Lions in Week 15. They allowed 30 or more points to their opponent for just the third time all season, the second occasion in the last three weeks. They’re 1-2 when allowing 30+ points on defense, so silencing this Seahawks’ dual-threat offense will be of utmost importance.\n\nWith the injuries seen on the Rams’ offense, expect both defenses to have a significant impact in this game. The Seahawks’ defense ranks fifth league-wide with 22 total takeaways, while the Rams are right behind them with 21 total takeaways. Neither quarterback has been perfect up to this point, so don’t be surprised if we’re in for a low-scoring game on the short week for both teams.\n\nThis matchup will have everything at-stake and while both teams are likely heading for the playoffs, their race atop the NFC West division has been the tightest we’ve seen in all the league. The Rams were the more impressive team in Week 15, but it came at a cost as several key players were banged-up in the process.\n\nThe Seahawks certainly didn’t look their best against Philip Rivers and the Indianapolis Colts, but it was a tough game to scheme against with the unpredictability of a new quarterback under center. I expect the Seahawks to look much better during this game as their defense rises to the occasion against Matthew Stafford. For our final pick, we’ll take the Seattle Seahawks to win a defensive battle at home in this one.\n\nFinal Rams-Seahawks Thursday Night Football Prediction & Pick: Seattle Seahawks +1.5 (-122); UNDER 44.5 (-115)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWe are 15 weeks into the 2025 NFL season, and some teams are jockeying for postseason position, while other players are just trying to put their best attributes on tape in hopes of improving their stock for next year. Speed is one of those key attributes that teams are always looking to stockpile.\n\nWhen the dust settled on Week 15, several playoff contenders were putting the pedal to the metal. A pair of Patriots were back in the mix once again, and one of the league's top defenders showed that speed isn't only a key asset on offense and special teams.\n\nHere is a look at the five fastest players in Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff pictures in Week 15\n\nAll speeds courtesy of NextGen stats.\n\nPlay type: 22-yard kickoff return\n\nThe New England Patriots duked it out with the Buffalo Bills in a huge AFC East divisional matchup.

In Week 15, it all came crashing down.\n\nNot only were the Chiefs ruled out of playoff contention as they dropped to 6-8, but late in the fourth quarter of their loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes went down with an injury that was later diagnosed as a torn ACL.\n\nFrom the start, it appeared to be a knee injury for Mahomes, who then limped back to the locker room with trainers. Postgame, head coach Andy Reid said the injury “didn’t look good,\" leaving some worry for the potential worst-case scenario that was later confirmed: a torn ACL.\n\nHere's the latest on Mahomes' injury, as well as a breakdown of how ACL injuries have impacted players' recovery in the past.\n\nSix reasons why the Chiefs never got over Super Bowl hangover\n\nPatrick Mahomes suffers knee injury on final drive of Chiefs-Chargers\n\nChiefs officially eliminated from NFL playoffs with loss to Chargers\n\nHow long Chiefs are expected to be without Patrick Mahomes after knee injury\n\nFollowing testing, Mahomes was officially diagnosed with a torn ACL on Sunday night, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\n\"An MRI has confirmed that Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in his left knee in today’s game,\" the Chiefs said in a statement. \"Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.\"\n\nMahomes also shared a message to fans on social media.\n\n\"Don’t know why this had to happen. And not going to lie [it] hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again,\" Mahomes wrote. \"Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers.

Mahomes' is considered fully torn, per the Chiefs, but his official timetable for recovery has not yet been revealed.\n\nBecause ACLs are responsible for many rapid movements, especially in football, the average recovery time can be anywhere from 6-12 months in the NFL, with a wide range based on the extent of the tear, whether not surgery is required, the player's age, and plenty more.\n\nPer Bass Medical Group, a torn ACL that requires surgery and rehab typically carries an 8-12 month recovery timeline in the NFL. Meanwhile, a mild MCL sprain is a 2-6 week recovery, and a complete MCL rupture is 3-6 months.\n\nThe severity of a torn ACL is determined in a grading system, like some other injuries.\n\nThe least severe type of ACL injury is a Grade 1 ailment, which means the ligament was stretched but is still intact. In this case, someone may have some mild pain and swelling, but it would not require surgery.\n\nA Grade 2 ACL tear means the ligament is loose, or partially torn. Surgery may depend on the severity of the injury, as it can sometimes heal non-surgically.\n\nThe worst-case scenario with ACL injuries is a complete tear, which is a Grade 3. The ligament is in two pieces, leading to knee instability and more severe pain. This often requires surgery to repair.\n\nIn the 2025 season alone, recent NFL players to be diagnosed with torn ACLs, in some capacity, include New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz and Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr.\n\nNabers' injury came in September, and an MRI confirmed a season-ending torn ACL. He is expected to return by the start of the 2026 season.\n\nErtz's injury was more recent, as he took a big hit in Week 14 that resulted in a torn ACL diagnosis. It's unknown whether the veteran tight end will retire, but he likely wouldn't be able to return until mid-way through the 2026 season.\n\nPenix partially tore his ACL, so his was not as severe as Nabers' or Ertz's. Per ESPN, Penix underwent surgery to have his ACL reconstructed in November with a nine-month recovery period expected, with hopes that he's ready for the start of the 2026 season.",

Could not be more proud of these guys, Could not be prouder [of] our coaching staff and support system. This is [an] unbelievable run. We are playing good football. I wish we had a couple more [games] left. Maybe [a] team in Georgia. Maybe somebody else out there.”\n\nThe season might be over for Santa Margarita Catholic, but when Palmer points to his club is playing its best football of the season, he’s got a valid point.\n\nThe Eagles’ recent run of victories includes impressive wins over nationally ranked teams like De La Salle, Corona Centennial, Orange Lutheran, Mater Dei and Sierra Canyon. Palmer mentioning his wishes of his team possibly playing a team out of Georgia or somewhere else possibly points to seeing themselves crowned as a national champion of high school football.\n\nOne would have to wonder what a matchup between Santa Margarita Catholic and a team like Carrollton (Ga.), Buford (Ga.) or St. Frances Academy (Md.), which won the Overtime Nationals championship last week, would’ve been like. All we’re left with is to imagine what that could’ve turned into.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "description": "Which bets do you like the most?",
    "fullText": "Week 15 was a good one for the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nNot only did they snap their three-game losing streak by dominating the Las Vegas Raiders in a shutout win.\n\nThey also got some help in the form of the Dallas Cowboys, who were 5.5-point betting favorites at home, losing to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday night.\n\nThe Eagles’ magic number to win their division is now down to one.\n\nThis means the Birds can officially clinch the NFC East in Week 16 by beating the Washington Commanders in Maryland on Saturday evening.\n\nIf the Eagles lose that game, they can still clinch the NFC East on Sunday if the Cowboys lose at home to the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nIf neither result works in the Eagles’ favor, they’ll have to try again in Week 17.\n\nThe only way Dallas can win the division at this point is if the Eagles lose their final three games AND the Cowboys win their final three games.\n\nWeek 16 at Washington Commanders\nWeek 17 at Buffalo Bills\nWeek 18 vs. Washington Commanders\n\nWeek 16 vs. Los Angeles Chargers\nWeek 17 at Washington Commanders\nWeek 18 at New York Giants\n\nThe Eagles are on the precipice of becoming the first team to repeat as NFC East champions since they last did it back in 2004.\n\nElsewhere in the NFC playoff picture, the Eagles got help with both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers losing in Week 15. Those results work towards Philly not falling to the No. 4 seed, which is important since that team is likely going to have to host the second place finisher in the NFC West in the Wild Card round. Not an ideal first round matchup.\n\nThe Eagles are currently on track to be the No. 3 seed. If they end up in that position, they’ll host the No. 6 seed. The San Francisco 49ers reside in that position at this moment.\n\nIt’s possible the Eagles can climb up to the No. 2 seed, which is what they had last year. But they’d likely need to win out and also get some help with the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers dropping games.

    "fullText": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — In the below-freezing tunnel of Gillette Stadium, Mike Vrabel held a stat sheet in his left hand and kept his right hand free for greetings.\n\nVrabel extended a fist bump to some of his players and a reassuring chest pat to others. He was not festive but he also was not forlorn. This was not the head-hanging or tunnel walk of silence in which losing coaches so often engage.\n\nIn fact, when tight end Hunter Henry looked down and shook his head after their encounter, Vrabel seemed intent on reminding the veteran: A 35-31 loss to the reigning league MVP and five-years-running division champions is nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n“You know what I mean? This is the National Football League,” Vrabel shouted as Henry disappeared into the locker room.\n\nMike Vrabel reassures his players as they head back to locker room after 35-31 loss to Bills snaps Patriots 10-game win streak: pic.twitter.com/9KBnUR8yYV\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) December 14, 2025\n\nBefore long, receiver Stefon Diggs rounded out the group of players to trickle off the field and Vrabel, too, disappeared into the locker room to address his squad after their first loss since Sept. 21.\n\nThe manner of losing warranted some disappointment, after the Patriots blew a 21-point lead and 17-point halftime lead to the Buffalo Bills and snapped their 10-game winning streak in a stadium where both locker rooms spoke candidly about the seeming inevitably of Josh Allen.\n\nBut there was also reason for the Patriots to appreciate, if not celebrate, the value of their first final-score adversity in months. At 11-3 and atop the AFC East, albeit now just by one game, New England is well on track to host at least one playoff game for the first time since Vrabel’s Titans upset them in a wild-card game six years ago.\n\n[Get more Patriots news: New England team feed]\n\nTriumphing in January if not also February tends to require a degree of callousing. Sunday’s game, in which the Patriots had a host of individual accolades but not the final result they coveted, provided some. No, the division-champion hats and shirts did not leave their boxes Sunday. But the Patriots may have received a more substantive gift.\n\n“It’s good for us,” said Diggs, who’s played in the NFC championship and AFC championship games with the Minnesota Vikings and Bills, respectively. “When you’re playing a team like that, they play from behind. They’re used to playing from behind, fighting back and clawing. … It’s been a while since we lost [and] we probably needed it.\n\n“It’s like a daily dose of your humble pie.”\n\nAre there lessons Patriots can only learn from losses?\n\n“100%,” Stefon Diggs said after loss to Bills. “It’s like a daily dose of your humble pie.” pic.twitter.com/r5y3R9q5l8\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) December 14, 2025\n\nCornerback Carlton Davis, who won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tom Brady, echoed the sentiment.\n\n“We don't want to go into the playoffs not having been scathed,” Davis told Yahoo Sports. “The Patriots organization hasn't been in this position in quite a minute. So it’s good to get a little taste of that playoff atmosphere.\n\n“That’s a playoff team. They go to the big dance every year. So yeah, that was a great warmup for us.”\n\nBeneath a light but steady dusting of snow, the Patriots warmed up more quickly than the Bills.\n\nQuarterback Drake Maye’s MVP case was up for trial amid a relatively soft schedule of opponents. He’d already outlasted the Bills in Buffalo and the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay. Could he also finish off the Bills at home?\n\nFinding Kayshon Boutte 30 yards down the right sideline on third-and-7 aroused the home crowd’s first outburst of “M-V-P” chants. An 8-yard touchdown on a designed run around the left end cued up another chorus.\n\nBefore the first quarter was over, Maye would also scramble up the middle of the field 7 yards for a second rushing score to double the two rushing touchdowns he’d scored in 13 prior games this season. At that point, an uninformed bystander may have confused which quarterback was the dual-threat, reigning MVP.\n\n“Just seeing the defense and trying to use my legs when I can, trying to add an extra element in the red zone to gain an extra hat,” Maye said. “And from there, try to make a play and try to get in the end zone.”\n\nMaye’s success required the Bills defense to respect his legs. That threat aided explosive rookie TreVeyon Henderson in finding creases up the middle to spring a third New England rushing touchdown, Henderson’s second-level dominance carrying him the 52 yards home.\n\nThe Patriots, up 21-0 with 5:53 to play in the first half, held a 91.1% chance of winning, per Next Gen Stats win probability data.\n\nBut that algorithm didn’t account for Josh Allen being Josh Allen … which translated statistically into rebounding from three straight punts to score five straight touchdowns.\n\nAs the third quarter waned and the fourth quarter ratcheted up Buffalo’s intensity, the Bills hit their stride.\n\nCornerback Tre’Davious White intercepted Maye with 1:39 to play in the third quarter, thwarting a chance for the Patriots to respond after the Bills had narrowed New England’s lead to three. White’s interception still set the  Bills up with a daunting 91-yard field. But Buffalo didn’t blink.\n\nAllen converted a keeper on third-and-1 and, when he failed to move the chains on a third-and-2 pass, Bills coach Sean McDermott kept his offense on the field. Facing fourth-and-3 from the 45, again everyone in the stadium was reminded that Allen is inevitable.\n\nAnd thus a 37-yard pass from Allen arrived in the arms of receiver Khalil Shakir, even as Shakir needed to stretch his arms around cornerback Marcus Jones in the process.\n\nFour plays later, on third-and-14, Allen fired a laser to tight end Dawson Knox for Knox’s second touchdown of the afternoon — and the Bills’ first lead of the game.\n\n“I saw Josh rolling out, we work the scramble drill a lot in practice and just threw a frozen rope right in my chest,” Knox said. “I had no choice but to catch that one. Just crazy scramble drill. It was just a five verticals concept. I was supposed to kind of stay on my side of the field.\n\n“Unbelievable throw by Josh Allen, man.”\n\nAnother Henderson unleashing in the form of a 65-yard touchdown (and stellar downfield blocking from Maye) wouldn’t be enough to derail the Bills’ momentum. With a 24-7 second-half advantage and heavy pressure on Maye disrupting the Patriots’ passing game, the Bills gave the Patriots a taste of the challenges that await New England in January.\n\n“That was a playoff game,” Davis said. “When you get down to the end of the season and you start talking about seeding, you start talking about division, that’s a playoff game.\n\n“Maybe we needed this loss to help us correct a couple of things. And so [we know] we’re not invincible, but still a great team.”\n\nThe Patriots want to be clear: Winning was the goal and preference Sunday.\n\n“Of course we’re not happy with that,” Henderson said after a career-high 161 scrimmage yards and two scores. “Of course we wanted to come out with the win.”\n\nBut losing a game in which they outgained the Bills 285 yards to 76 in the first half, also putting the Bills in their largest halftime hole (17 points) of the season?\n\nIf that doesn’t teach New England’s locker room the necessity of playing 60 minutes, the Patriots aren’t sure what will. Linebacker Jack Gibbens was not alone in believing that “the sense of urgency to get things fixed after a loss definitely picks up.” The blueprint that the Bills parlayed — pressure Maye into thinking about the pass rush at the expense of downfield routes, wear down a depleted New England defensive cast with extended drives — will come back to haunt the Patriots if they don’t respond accordingly.\n\nSure, Maye excites the Patriots in the present and the future, his 109.1 passer rating trailing only the Los Angeles’ Rams Matthew Stafford and Detroit Lions’ Jared Goff while his 70.9% completion percentage leads the league.\n\nMaye’s 27 offensive touchdowns are tied for seventh-most in the NFL. His accuracy, play extension and smarts to change plays at the line of scrimmage impress teammates and opponents alike. He has received comparisons to Allen.\n\nBut he’s not there yet. Because there’s a belief that teams develop when a quarterback has already proven they can win and rebound repeatedly in improbable circumstances. The MVPs of recent history have done that. There were days when one just could not explain Allen or Patrick Mahomes or Lamar Jackson or Aaron Rodgers.\n\nMaye, meanwhile, has helped the Patriots start fast and survive attempts to thwart wins. He will continue to build his arsenal of late-game comebacks and fourth-quarter elevations as Allen has in a career that’s already earned him an MVP, albeit not yet the Super Bowl title he eyes.\n\nVrabel will tell Maye, as he tells all his players, that losses like Sunday’s are part of that climb. They’re part of the pursuit of greatness and they’re part of the maturation process that will sharpen a team when games don’t just resemble playoff environments but also carry the elimination actualities. Next week’s visit to the Baltimore Ravens will present yet another chance.\n\nThat sense of resolve settled over the Patriots as the rawness of their loss softened slightly.\n\nVrabel’s call to Henry that “this is the National Football League” didn’t compel the tight end to turn back on his dejected entrance into the locker room. But 16 minutes later, as Hunter addressed reporters from his locker, he had absorbed — consciously or subconsciously — the message.\n\n“This definitely can be a kind of kick in the butt,” Henry said. “We’ve had things go our way and everything go our way the last 10 weeks, so this is definitely a reality check.\n\n“That’s a good football team. We went toe to toe with them in every aspect. But we have to give them credit.\n\n“We’ve got to get a lot better from this — fast.”",

    "title": "2026 NFL Draft Order: NY Giants still hold No. 1 overall pick",
    "description": "The NY Giants hold the No.1 pick after their eighth consecutive loss.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants suffered a frustrating 29-21 loss to the Washington Commanders on Sunday as they returned from their bye week. As a result, the Giants continued to hold the No.1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThere were some flashes, like Abdul Carter having a breakout game, big plays from tight ends Daniel Bellinger and Theo Johnson, DB Dru Phillips, and RB Tyrone Tracy. But there were simply too many miscues and missed opportunities to overcome with late magic. But ultimately it was too little, too late for the Giants and their frantic comeback fell short.\n\nThe loss also highlighted the shortcomings of the Giants’ roster, as the receivers consistently failed to get open, once again forcing Jaxson Dart to hold the ball or take a big hit when scrambling, and struggled to hang onto the ball when they did find separation. This was also (probably) Jermaine Eluemunor’s worst game of the season, as he struggled against veteran pass rusher Von Miller, and the Giants struggled to consistently move the ball in short-yardage situations on the ground.\n\nThe Giants’ eighth-consecutive loss comes one day after Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThat brings us to the upside of the loss for the Giants: there are a number of quarterback-needy teams in the Top 10 of the draft, and it’s possible that Mendoza will be the only highly-regarded quarterback to come out this year. That could make the first overall pick highly valuable if teams like the New York Jets, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns, and New Orleans Saints are all vying for the top quarterback prospect.\n\nNobody wants to see the Giants lose, but trading the first overall pick could net valuable assets to fill multiple holes in the first two or three rounds. The Giants could use a highly-drafted receiver as well as a long-term answer at right tackle. Likewise, the Giants need a long-term answer at right guard and an infusion of youth and athleticism at linebacker.\n\nMost early mock drafts have the Giants drafting a wide receiver or an offensive tackle with their first pick. A sizeable haul of picks could allow them to address both positions with high picks, as well as add one of the talented linebackers or defensive backs in this class.\n\nIt remains to be seen who will make that pick, but the Giants could have a tremendous amount of capital to go with a young roster.\n\nThe Giants’ road to the first overall pick is a tight one. They share a 2-12 record with the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders (who they play in two weeks). The Jets, Browns, and Arizona Cardinals are also each a game out of the first pick at 3-11, though the Saints managed to beat the Carolina Panthers and improve to 4-10 on the season.\n\nNew York still has games against the Minnesota Vikings, the afore-mentioned Raiders, and the Dallas Cowboys to end the season. They remain a team that can compete with any in the NFL, as well as lose to any in the NFL, so no outcome between 1st and 10th overall is out of the question.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch the NFL game tonight\n\nEntering the final quarter of the NFL season, it’s officially do-or-die for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSitting at a precarious 6-6-1 after a damaging Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions, the Cowboys are clinging to life in the NFC playoff picture. The road to the NFC East crown has become a steep uphill climb, with the division-leading Philadelphia Eagles holding a significant advantage at 8-5. For Dallas, the margin for error has evaporated; it can no longer afford the inconsistent performances that have defined its season.\n\nWith the NFC wild-card race stacked — featuring contenders like the Lions, Panthers and Buccaneers — the Cowboys need a near-perfect run to separate themselves. Their remaining schedule features three of four games against NFC opponents with playoff implications. The crucible begins immediately in Week 15 with a pivotal home Sunday Night Football clash against the Minnesota Vikings (5-8).\n\nWhile Minnesota will almost certainly miss the playoffs, it provides a tough matchup for Dallas. The Vikings' defense is coming off a game where it shut out the Commanders, forcing three turnovers and giving up just over 200 yards in a 31-0 win. Offensively, while J.J. McCarthy has had his struggles in his first year as a starter, the Vikings still have plenty of weapons to boats, including a top wide receiver duo in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison; with these two, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, the receiving talent is off the charts.\n\nDallas needs a home primetime win to keep its playoff aspirations alive, while Minnesota is looking to build on the momentum it generated last week.\n\nFollow along for all the action from AT&T Stadium.\n\nSTREAM: Watch Vikings vs. Cowboys LIVE with Peacock\n\nNFL HQ:Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\n\n10:42 p.m.: Williams is back with two big carries.

    "description": "Our Packers vs. Broncos predictions like the Green Bay moneyline on Sunday, December 14.",
    "fullText": "Two of the best teams in football collide at Empower Field at Mile High when the Green Bay Packers visit the Denver Broncos today. Kickoff is at 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS.\n\nMy Packers vs. Broncos predictions and NFL picks call for Green Bay to leave The Centennial State victorious on Sunday, December 14.\n\nPackers vs Broncos Best bet: Packers moneyline (-125)\n\nQuarterback play is the No. 1 reason I’m backing the Green Bay Packers to win on the road against the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High in Week 15.\n\nPackers QB Jordan Love paced the NFL in EPA + CPOE composite while throwing for the second most air yards during a three-game sweep of the NFC North, and Green Bay also ranks higher than Denver in DVOA.\n\nAdd the Pack pacing the league in EPA per play while playing a considerably more difficult schedule than the Broncos, and I’m confident in Green Bay leaving The Centennial State with a win.\n\nDenver has played the fifth easiest schedule per PFF and second-easiest by DVOA, after all.\n\nReturning to the QB comparison, Broncos signal caller Bo Nix ranks 18th in EPA + CPOE composite, and his 6.3 yards per attempt and 63.2 completion percentage are both also below-average marks.\n\nOf course, the Green Bay defense has also allowed the fifth-fewest yards per play and ranks ninth in defensive DVOA, and the Packers generate pressure at a respectable 12th-highest clip despite blitzing at the second-lowest rate.\n\nEven with a pair of solid defenses, I’m expecting both the Packers and Broncos to put points on the board Sunday.\n\nThey’ve both hit the Over in consecutive games, and in addition to the highlighted strength of the Love-led Packers on offense, Nix also has the Broncos ranking above average in offensive DVOA, points per game, and both EPA and yards per play.\n\nGreen Bay wideout Jayden Reed is a big-play threat as a receiver and rusher, and he’s found the end zone 18 times through 36 career games.\n\nAdditionally, while the Broncos have only allowed five touchdowns to opposing wide receivers, three of those scores have come in the past two weeks with Denver dipping to 18th in pass defense DVOA through the two-game stretch after ranking third across the first 12 weeks of the year.\n\nBroncos back RJ Harvey has found the end zone in four of the past six games for seven total touchdowns, and he’s also piled up a healthy 15 carries and five targets in the red zone during the stretch.\n\nJayden Reed Over 0.5 touchdowns\n\nSpread: Green Bay -2.5 (-110) | Denver +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Green Bay -136 | Denver +116\n\nOver/Under: Over 42.5 (-118) | Under 42.5 (-104)\n\nI’m obviously backing the Pack, and I think they’re a more complete team on offense with the defensive gap between the two teams far smaller. Additionally, the Broncos couldn’t pull away from the lowly Washington Commanders and Las Vegas Raiders the past two weeks, while the Packers just swept a tough stretch of three consecutive divisional opponents.\n\nThis spread is where things are tricky because I’m anticipating a close game, and the Broncos have won 10 straight, after all. There’s a strong case for taking the points with Denver, and I particularly think the Broncos are an excellent leg for six-point teasers with the spread moving through multiple key numbers to +8.5.\n\nAs noted, I think this total is just a touch short. Both defenses are excellent, but there are no weather concerns, and the Broncos are no slouches on offense with above-average ranks in in offensive DVOA, points per game, and both EPA and yards per play.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have won four straight road games.

    "fullText": "The 8-5 Indianapolis Colts continue their free fall, turning to Philip Rivers in their trip to Lumen Field to take on the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nMy Colts vs. Seahawks predictions are taking Indy's offense out of the equation, instead focusing on the special talent of Jaxon Smith-Njigba.\n\nFind out \n\nColts vs Seahawks Best bet: Jaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown (-120)\n\nThis is a nightmare matchup scenario for the Indianapolis Colts with the NFL's leading receiver this season lining up against them on the outside.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba has nine touchdowns this season, with multi-touchdown games in two of his last three.\n\nThe Colts have allowed 18 passing touchdowns this season to only 13 rushing touchdowns. Most of those touchdowns have come to receivers that have lined up outside compared to the slot position and on the line.\n\nSmith-Njigba has aligned out wide on 77.4% of his routes this season compared to only 14.8% of routes last season. From wide alignment, he has averaged 12.0 yards per target and caught eight touchdowns.\n\nThe Colts have only allowed 7.4 yards per target to receivers aligned out wide, but they have given up 13 touchdowns, which is tied for second-most in the NFL.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks rank third in the NFL in deep passing and seventh in long passing. Most of that is because of JSN and his ability to make big plays downfield. The Colts' defense ranks 22nd and 26th in those two categories.\n\nThis is a matchup tailor-made for Smith-Njigba to find the endzone.\n\nTo add to my best bet, I'm adding Kenneth Walker III to stay Under his rushing total, as he does most of his damage on outside runs, and the Colts are excellent at defending those.\n\nFinally, I am taking Alec Pierce to stay Under his receptions, as he is a serious deep threat mostly, and I don’t expect Rivers to be launching too many of those in his return.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown\n\nKenneth Walker III Under 57.5 rushing yards\n\nAlec Pierce Under 2.5 receptions\n\nWith Rivers starting, I expect Jonathan Taylor to be heavily involved in both the passing and running games, and he will be needed to literally do it all.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba anytime touchdown\n\nKenneth Walker III Under 57.5 rushing yards\n\nAlec Pierce Under 2.5 receptions\n\nJonathan Taylor Over 97.5 rushing + receiving yards\n\nJonathan Taylor anytime touchdown\n\nThere is no chance that Rivers and the Colts will be able to come into Seattle and beat a team still desperately fighting for the NFC West.\n\nThe Seahawks have a great pass rush, and that is going to be trouble for a 44-year-old quarterback who hasn’t played in five years.\n\nThe Under has hit in three of the last five Colts games, and the Seahawks have only allowed nine points in the previous two games combined, and they haven’t allowed a touchdown in eight quarters.\n\nSpread: Colts +10 (-110) | Seahawks -10 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Colts +425 | Seahawks -600\n\nOver/Under: Over 43.5 (-110) | Under 43.5 (-110)\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts have only hit the moneyline in three of their last 10 away games.

    "description": "Our Panthers vs. Saints predictions see Rico Dowdle starring in a Carolina victory in Week 15.",
    "fullText": "The Carolina Panthers can take another step toward a playoff berth — their first since 2017 — with a win at New Orleans today.\n\nMy Panthers vs. Saints predictions and NFL picks call for the Panthers to roll as road favorites on Sunday, December 14.\n\nPanthers vs Saints Best bet: Panthers moneyline (-156)\n\nThe Carolina Panthers have been wandering through the desert since Cam Newton's peak. They have a seven-season playoff drought and have gone through coaches and starting quarterbacks like Gatorade cups on the sidelines under fiery owner David Tepper.\n\nDave Canales and former top overall pick Bryce Young have stabilized things, however. Carolina has already matched its best win total of the last eight seasons, and the Panthers are in first place in the division by a half game. If they win this week and next, they'll wrap up the division crown before week 17.\n\nCarolina is a road favorite this week, just the second time that's happened in three years. The Panthers haven't handled success well this season. Just as the team seems ready to take a step forward, it's fallen on its face.\n\nThat pattern includes embarrassing losses to the Bills at home and the 49ers on Monday Night Football. It also consists of a 17-7 home loss to these Saints in November.\n\nThat game was the best start of the season for New Orleans Saints rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, who had a career-high 282 passing yards against the Panthers.\n\nAs if the promise of a playoff berth weren't motivation enough, the Panthers will be looking for a bit of revenge against Shough and the Saints, whom several players on Carolina feel they may have overlooked in that first matchup.\n\nThe Saints' offense is bottom five in the league in scoring, turnovers lost, passing touchdowns, and the major rushing categories (yards, TDs, and per carry average).\n\nThe Saints have lost three straight ATS at home, and last week's upset at Tampa Bay was their first time topping the 20-point mark in eight games.\n\nBoth teams have low-scoring offenses. The Saints are in the bottom five in most categories, and Carolina is one of the five worst scorers and, other than rushing yards, is in the bottom half of the NFL in most offensive measures. \n\nThe Panthers have gone under in the last three games; their over/under was as low as 40.5, including the 17-7 (-38) loss to the Saints last month. New Orleans has gone under four of the previous five times they've seen a total of 40.5 or lower, including twice over the previous four games.\n\nThis game should be a low-scoring battle of field goals, but the Panthers will give the ball to Rico Dowdle to kill the clock in the second half. He'll likely reward them with a late touchdown to seal things in what may be the game's only trip to the end zone.\n\nAfter just over a month as a starter, the league has enough film on Shough. He had his worst passing day since his first NFL start last week at Tampa Bay (144 yards).\n\nThis week, he'll be without his top running back as Alan Kamara has been ruled out. Kamara is also a valuable dump-off passing target for Shough, who will be facing a Panthers defense that can apply pressure and force turnovers.\n\nRico Dowdle Over 56.5 rushing yards\n\nTyler Shough under 202.5 passing yards\n\nTyler Shough under 31.5 yards longest pass\n\nThe Panthers are dialed in and ready to break their win one/lose one streak, while the Saints have nothing to play for and will be down one of their top offensive contributors in Kamara. Carolina should be ready to take a step toward wrapping up the division.\n\nWhat you see is what you get with the Panthers. Their ATS outcome has matched their straight-up one for the last 10 games. This is an unfamiliar spot for them, as they haven't been a road favorite very often. Still, in a game that will likely be an old-school smashmouth affair, they should be able to control the time of possession and put the game away late with a superior running game.\n\nThis game will feature plenty of threes and a shortage of sevens. Neither quarterback is a proven playmaker. Young is in game manager mode, and, for this game, that means not taking risks and getting the team in scoring position.\n\nSpread: Panthers -2.5 (-110) | Saints +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Panthers -135 | Saints +115\n\nOver/Under: Over 40 (-110) | Under 40 (-110)\n\nThe New Orleans Saints have hit the team total Under in 12 of their last 20 games.

    "description": "Before hosting Miami in the CFP, Texas A&M Edge Cashius Howell and WR KC Concepcion are projected as first-round NFL Draft selections.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is just six days away from hosting Miami (FL) (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff, as both teams are headed to the tournament for the first time in program history, and will meet for the third time in the last three seasons.\n\nOn paper, both teams are highly similar, possessing NFL talent on both sides of the ball, and their starting quarterbacks, Marcel Reed and Carson Beck, each threw for 25 touchdowns and 10 interceptions during the regular season, connecting with elite playmakers.\n\nFor the Hurricanes, freshman wideout Malachi Toney is a nightmare matchup. At the same time, Texas A&M transfer wide receivers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver combined for over 1,700 yards and 15 total touchdowns, and are a mismatch for every secondary they've faced this season. With Craver expected to return next season, Concepcion will likely declare for the NFL Draft.\n\nOn defense, Texas A&M edge Cashius Howell and Miami defensive lineman Rueben Bain are both considered top 10 prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft, and have a chance to solidify their standing as elite pass rushers on Saturday afternoon. Either way, both players are headed to the draft regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis week, Pro Football Focus's Trevor Sikkema released his latest 2026 Mock Draft, projecting Cashius Howell as the 6th overall pick to the Washington Commanders, who would join former Texas A&M and future Hall of Fame defensive end Von Miller for at least one season.\n\nThe Commanders defense is in a bad place right now, and it starts up front. Howell will face plenty of skepticism about his draft range, given his very short arms for the position, yet he has earned pass-rush grades above 90.0 in three straight seasons, with win rates above 19.0% over that same span.\n\nConcepcion, who finished his first season in College Station with 57 receptions and a team-high 886 receiving yards and 9 touchdowns, paired with two punt return scores, is the perfect addition for any team looking for a Day 1 starting slot receiver and punt returner. According to Sikkema, the San Francisco 49ers will be looking to replace Debo Samuels for the first time in two seasons.\n\nWithout Deebo Samuel, it feels like the 49ers are missing that go-to yards after catch receiver. They are using running back Christian McCaffrey a lot for that, but it’s not quite the same as scheming things up for a receiver. Concepcion is averaging more than 7.0 yards after the catch this year and has that kind of acceleration and athleticism.\n\nFor the Aggies to have any shot at making it to the quarterfinals against No. 2 Ohio State, both Conecpcion and Howell will need to play their best football.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Two Texas A&M starters projected as first-round NFL Draft picks",

The offensive line play for Philadelphia has been poor, to say the least. As a result, the run game and Saquon Barkley, to be specific, have not been as effective.\n\nThe Raiders have been a disaster. However, there are still some bright spots on this roster. Brock Bowers has finally started to look like himself after recovering from his injury, but more importantly, after the firing of offensive coordinator Chip Kelly.\n\nAfter surpassing 100 rushing yards in Week 4 against the Chicago Bears, rookie running back Ashton Jeanty has not exceeded 75 rushing yards in any other game.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams don't have time to think about the 2026 NFL Draft just yet, but they will be in a few months. L.A. currently has two first-round picks thanks to the team's 2025 trade with the Atlanta Falcons, and could be picking in the top-10 depending on how the rest of the season pans out.\n\nIn FOX Sports draft expert Rob Rang's latest mock draft, the Rams go all offense with their first two picks. Rang predicts L.A. takes Utah offensive tackle Spencer Fano with the Falcons' pick and then comes back around with an offensive weapon at the end of the first round with Washington receiver Denzel Boston.\n\nOne of the few areas of concern for the Rams is at right tackle, where Warren McClendon has struggled with inconsistency. The 6-foot-6, 309 pound Fano is surprisingly agile with NFL bloodlines and experience playing both tackle spots.\n\nThere are a lot of gifted receiver tandems in the NFL, but few can match the Rams’ Puka Nacua and Davante Adams’ production. Both, however, have struggled with durability, which could leave Les Snead valuing Boston's similar combination of size and ball skills. With an extra first-round pick to play with, Snead might view adding yet another gifted pass-catcher for Matthew Stafford to target as a cheap and savvy insurance policy.\n\nThe picks make sense on its surface, but both would be luxury selections for the Rams.\n\nMcClendon has been playing like one of the better linemen recently in place of the injured Rob Havenstein. If he finishes strong, the Rams may not need to look at linemen early in the 2026 draft.\n\nMeanwhile, Boston doesn't fill an obvious need for L.A. Nacua will be around for a while and Adams sounds like he'll stick around as long as Stafford is on the team. The Rams have a solid depth of players behind both Jordan Whittington and Konata Mumpfield, so adding Boston now wouldn't give any of the backup receivers a chance to develop.\n\nBoston has been great for Washington over the past two years, though. The 6-foot-4, 209-pounder caught 119 receptions for 1,589 yards and 19 touchdowns over his past 24 games. Drafting him would be a future-looking move for a Rams team looking to maximize it's Super Bowl contention window.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: 2026 NFL mock draft: Rams upgrade offense in first round",

    "description": "With Stafford close to overtaking Rivers on the list (and Rivers not far behind another legendary quarterback), we could see some movement this year.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers is back. Well, sort of back.\n\nAfter working out with the Colts earlier this week following a season-ending injury to starter Daniel Jones and an undisclosed injury to backup Riley Leonard, Rivers officially ended his retirement to sign with the Colts' practice squad. But initially, it seemed Rivers was a contingency plan for the Colts, and that they were hopeful Leonard would be healthy enough to start.\n\nNow, Leonard apparently \"feels great\" and has participated in three consecutive practices as of Friday. But Colts head coach Shane Steichen, who worked with Rivers for six seasons with the Chargers, would not confirm whether or not he planned to start Rivers this weekend, increasing the likelihood that we may see the 44-year-old veteran lace up his cleats for the first time in nearly five years after retiring following the 2020 season.\n\n\"He's got great command in the huddle. He was throwing it well. So we're excited for it. He's fired up for the challenge, getting back into it, getting back in the fold, feeling the pass rush. Got some good work in that,\" Steichen said.\n\n\"I'll say it was pretty good. A guy that hasn't been out there in five years, to go and practice the way he did this week was pretty impressive to watch.\"\n\nThose sound like the words of a coach who is impressed with his quarterback, so maybe it's not so crazy to think we'll see Rivers this week. And if we do, it will be just in time to defend his spot on the NFL all-time passing yards list. You see, Rivers currently ranks seventh in career passing yards, with 63,440 yards. But behind him at number eight on the list is another active quarterback – Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, with 63,163 yards.\n\nFor those whose strong suit isn't math, Stafford trails Rivers by just 277 yards. Stafford has thrown for that amount or more six times this season, including in last week's win over Arizona, where he tallied 281 passing yards. So really, Stafford is one good game away from the record. But this all changes if Rivers gets playing time this weekend.\n\nIf Rivers is back in action, then this becomes a race. And what if Rivers does play, performs well, and is back next year? You see, Stafford is getting older as well, and is currently 37 and playing his 17th NFL season. Yes, he looks to be at the top of his game, but the body won't hold out forever unless you're Philip Rivers, apparently. So who is to say Stafford doesn't end up trapped at eighth?\n\nAnd for another fun fact, Rivers needs just 649 yards to surpass Ben Roethlisberger for sixth all-time on the list. So if Rivers does get rolling or comes back for another year, he might knock Big Ben down a rung on the ladder as well. And above Roethlisberger? Well, that's current Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who passed the former Steelers signal caller at the beginning of this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Can Philip Rivers fend off Matt Stafford on NFL career passing list?",

    "fullText": "Cardinals predicted to replace Kyler Murray, make bold trade in 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNot much has gone right for the Arizona Cardinals in 2025.\n\nThere was some optimism around the team this offseason, but the season has been a complete failure. Entering Week 15, the team is sitting at 3-10 and is buried at the bottom of the NFC West.\n\nQuarterback Kyler Murray has only played in five games this season, and it was recently revealed that he will not return in 2025. Is it possible we've seen the last of Murray in a Cardinals' uniform?\n\nPatrick K. Flowers of Bleacher Nation thinks so. Flowers published an updated mock draft, and he has the Cardinals making a bold move to replace Murray in the first round of the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nFlowers has the Cardinals trading up with the New York Giants for the No. 1 pick and selecting Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.\n\nRegarding the Mendoza selection, Flowers offered the following:\n\nThe Cardinals are going to move on from Kyler Murray. If they don’t trade up with the Giants (who seem intrigued enough in Jaxson Dart to pass on a QB), they’ll almost absolutely be shut out on the big three in the class.\n\nAs Flowers mentioned, it seems likely the Cardinals will move on from Murray. ESPN's Josh Weinfuss recently broke down that possibility, and explained that the Cardinals could save up to $42.5 million if they trade Murray after June 1.\n\nIt's not like the Cardinals were having much success with Murray, anyways. The quarterback went 2-3 as the starter this year and has not been to the playoffs since 2021.\n\nIn Mendoza, the Cardinals would be getting arguably the top quarterback prospect in the 2026 class. Mendoza is the heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy and he led the Hoosiers to a perfect record, Big 10 Championship, and a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\nIn 2025, his first season in Indiana, Mendoza has thrown for 2,980 yards with 33 touchdowns and six interceptions. Mendoza led the FBS in touchdown passes and led the Big 10 in yards per attempt.\n\nMendoza has an NFL arm and solid enough mobility to make some plays with his legs. He moves through his progressions nicely and is able to make throws in tight windows.\n\nIf the Cardinals move on from Murray, Mendoza could start immediately. Jacoby Brissett, who has looked serviceable in relief of Murray this season, is under contract for 2026, so he could be a perfect mentor to Mendoza.",

    "fullText": "Jeremiyah Love mock draft projection: Where will Notre Dame RB get picked in 2026 NFL Draft? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJeremiyah Love has put together two similar monster years as Notre Dame's top running back. His 2025 campaign earned him a trip to New York as a Heisman Trophy finalist.\n\nAfter amassing 2,497 rushing yards and scoring 35 touchdowns the past two seasons, averaging 6.9 yards per carry, Love has emerged as the clear best running back prospect for the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nHere's breaking down Love's talented skill set and how high he can go as a first-round pick when he's selected on April 23:\n\nMORE: The case for and against Jeremiyah Love for the Heisman\n\nLove (6-0, 214) is a well-built power back who also has great explosiveness to reel off long runs. His experience and consistency should make the St. Louis native have a smooth transition to the NFL\n\nLove is a complete back. He's got the power to run well through initial tackles and get tough chunks between the tackles. He's also got the breakaway speed to bounce any run to the outside or open field and go the distance with any touch. He is smart and reads his blocks well, showing exceptional balance, vision and patience. Although he wasn't used a lot as a receiver, he has the good hands to be a difference-maker in the passing game, extending from his rushing assets.\n\nLove might need to get a little stronger to hold up as the same type of power back in the NFL. Like most rookies coming into the NFL, pass blocking will become a greater emphasis to ensure he can stay on the field for three downs.\n\nMORE: College football bowl picks, predictions for CFP games\n\nAlvin Kamara is nearing the end at 31. The Saints have a lot of needs as a rebuilding team, but if they don't go defense or offensive line, Love would be a strong pick for offensive-minded Kellen Moore, who produced a career year out of Saquon Barkley in the Eagles' Super Bowl-winning run last season. Love's home-run attributes would add a needed fresh legs element.\n\nBetween Brian Robinson Jr., Austin Ekeler getting hurt and the team mashing up a committee of Chris Rodriguez Jr., Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Jeremy McNichols, the Commanders need to clean up their backfield and give Jayden Daniels a worthy, healthy young running mate. Adding Love would be much like the Lamar Jackson-Derrick Henry older duo that smashed for the nearby Ravens in 2024.\n\nThe Cardinals saw James Conner break down from his volume and backup Trey Benson also couldn't stay healthy, leaving an ineffective mixed fill-in bag of Bam Knight, Emari Demercado and Michael Carter. Conner will turn 31 in May and has plenty of wear. Love would be the ideal replacement to help whoever's the QB.\n\nMORE: Where Jeremiyah Love projects in SN's latest mock draft\n\nThe Jets may be trending toward moving on from Breece Hall, a pending free agent. Or they could try to keep Hall and draft someone for a dangerous 1-2 punch in the running game, given Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand saw first-hand the major effect of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs to revive the Lions' offense. Either way, bringing some Love to New York would be an option, given the Jets have two first-rounders.\n\nThe Vikings have seen Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason toggle between injury issues and getting a more reliable running game would be huge to take pressure off J.J. McCarthy or whoever their starting QB will be. Love can also provide an extra explosive element for Kevin O'Connell to better open up the passing game.",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza mock draft projection: Will Indiana QB go No. 1 overall in 2026 NFL Draft? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza wasn't expected to be the top quarterback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft. Following his surprise Heisman Trophy-caliber 2025 season at Indiana, however, now he will be taken high in the first round as the first QB off the board on April 23.\n\nWhy has Mendoza shot up draft boards for his play, and what's his pro outlook?\n\nHere's a profile of the Hoosiers passer, including what teams are most likely to draft him:\n\nMORE: The case for and against Fernando Mendoza for the Heisman\n\nMendoza (6-5, 225) has the ideal size as a strong pocket passer. The Cal transfer and Miami high school product was a hit in Curt Cignetti's dynamic offense. He's developed all the physical and mental qualities to be a top-10 pick for a QB-needy team.\n\nMendoza is very accurate with his short-to-intermediate passing. He is a good decision-maker who processes the field well. When he has a clean pocket, he can make all the throws. He also hangs tough in the pocket when facing pressure and is fearless in his execution. Mendoza is an aggressive thrower, but also avoids forcing the ball into coverage. He can zip it to take shots, but also adjust to show touch on passes when needed.\n\nMendoza can scramble for yardage when the defense breaks down and his big frame can help him on quarterback sneaks, but he won't add an element of plus athleticism to a team, as he's far less comfortable throwing on the run and won't provide any designed support for the running game. He will need to learn better how to dissect more complex pressure and coverage schemes in the NFL.\n\nMORE: College football bowl picks, predictions for CFP games\n\nWith the Giants (Jaxson Dart) and Titans (Cam Ward) taking first-round QBs in 2025, it's pretty clear where Mendoza might be headed. Here are the five teams to watch most to draft him\n\nWith Chip Kelly gone from the offense, Pete Carroll can look for a new OC with a pocket passer in mind to replace Geno Smith. It doesn't hurt that Mendoza's Big Ten clutch style would get a stamp of approval from part-owner Tom Brady.\n\nThe Browns will learn more about Shedeur Sanders for the rest of the 2025 season to see whether the rookie fifth-rounder deserves a more extended look to start in '26. If not, Cleveland would be firm play to try again at franchise QB.\n\nMORE: Where Fernando Mendoza projects in SN's latest mock draft\n\nWill the Saints see enough from Tyler Shough to make a call either way on the second-round rookie QB? If they want to go higher into the draft pool for offensive-minded Kellen Moore, Mendoza has the Dak Prescott-like pocket qualities to execute his offense well.\n\nAaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand saw the success of pocket-passing winning with Jared Goff (6-4, 217) in Detroit and may want to go that route to try again to strengthen the position for the long haul.\n\nThe Cardinals are heading to part ways with Kyler Murray and there might be some offensive coaching changes in store, too. Mendoza, Marvin Harrison Jr., Trey McBride and Michael Wilson would make for a good young passing game foundation.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "title": "Can a nepo baby be an underdog? The remarkable rise of Shedeur Sanders",
    "description": "The quarterback was seen as living off his father’s name when he entered the NFL. But he has slowly started to prove himself at the Cleveland Browns",
    "fullText": "It seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, the Cleveland Browns’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.\n\nHe excelled at two colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most dramatic stock crashes in league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.\n\nEarlier this week Sanders was named the Browns starter for the rest of the season, inviting even more scrutiny of a an already polarizing player. His supporters say Sanders is entitled to his shot; his critics say he lacks the skills to play in the NFL, question his attitude and paint him as a spoiled rich kid. Every argument seems to excavate deeper feelings about Deion Sanders, his Prime Time father who paved the way for his son’s success. In the age of the nepo baby, Shedeur makes for a strange underdog story.\n\nThere are expectations that come with being a starting quarterback in the NFL, after all. In addition to the requisite physical attributes and arm talent, the cliche dictates that quarterbacks are men of character – players who speak in the first person plural, deflect credit, absorb blame and lead with modesty. It’s how the quarterback position became shorthand for a standard of American leadership that was largely reserved for conservative white men until recently. But Shedeur doesn’t even resemble the Black quarterbacks who have in the last few years broken from that tradition and transformed the league. Instead, in character at least, he resembles his father. Deion is a flashy, brash and supremely self-confident two-sport superstar universally recognized as one of the best players in NFL history.\n\nAfter becoming the first Browns quarterback to win his first start since the team’s 1999 relaunch, a soundbite of Shedeur effectively congratulating himself for playing well despite his limited practice time overshadowed the more diplomatic remarks he’d make in praise of the team later. (“Imagine what a full offseason looks like,” he beamed. “It gets dangerous!”) When he was asked last Sunday if a botched two-point conversion attempt had worked during practice, he laughed. (“I don’t think you call plays in a game that didn’t work in practice,” he cracked.) After being criticized for his remarks in the media earlier this season, he was asked about the Browns’ quarterback situation. Sanders repeatedly answered by grinning and then silently moving his mouth in response – which had fans jokingly referring to him as Mime Time in a nod to his father.\n\n“We want our quarterbacks to be very, very humble,” says Louis Moore, the Michigan State history professor and author of The Great Black Hope: Doug Williams, Vince Evans, and the Making of the Black Quarterback. “He’s not that. He’s grown up believing that he’s allowed to have confidence in himself. The world beats down a lot of young Black kids, and Deion never let it happen.”\n\nThe biased nature of the scrutiny on Shedeur, especially when things don’t go his way, often results in fans bringing up racism. They further wonder whether Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski holds a grudge against the Sanders family because his father-in-law, Tim McCarver, had an infamous run-in with Deion during the latter’s baseball career.\n\nBut the issue isn’t quite so black and white. Somehow, the Sanders family manage to inspire Obama-level respect and enthusiasm among Black Americans (who helped make Shedeur’s Browns jersey a bestseller) while also having Donald Trump in their corner. The current president hasn’t hesitated to cannonball into the Shedeur Sanders discourse, calling NFL owners “stupid” for letting him fall in the draft and trumpeting “I TOLD YOU SO!” on social media after Shedeur led the Browns past the Raiders. Trump couldn’t let those moments pass without making some mention of Shedeur’s “exceptional genes” in what was otherwise a forceful show of support.\n\n“I’m just thankful for [Trump] even taking time out of his day to speak out,” said Shedeur, reveling in his nepo baby status. While Peyton Manning was determined to overshadow his father Archie’s fruitless years with the New Orleans Saints and Bronny James shrinks from the allusions to the more prominent Lakers player in his family, Shedeur has been happy to share a spotlight with his famous father for more than a decade.\n\nA good chunk of his adolescence was documented on Deion’s Family Playbook, a reality TV series that ran on Oprah’s cable channel. Shedeur then played under his father when Deion coached at Mississippi’s Jackson State University and the University of Colorado, and the pair were instrumental in reviving both of those programs. Wherever Shedeur goes, there’s usually a camera following him – and oftentimes his older brother Deion Sanders Jr, the architect of the family’s vast online media presence, is the one holding the camera. Around family, Shedeur reverts from a football star to a little brother who gets razzed about his fashion choices and his position on his father’s sibling power rankings.\n\nBeing Deion Sanders’s son made Shedeur savvy to how NFL storylines are shaped, and the one he’s crafted about himself strikes the media – who are used to taking charge of the narrative – as presumptuous. He calls himself “legendary”, shrugs off brickbats (“You think I’m worried about what critics say?”) and throws words like “destiny” around when projecting his career path. Resentments linger about his starry approach to the draft process that may well have cost him the chance to be picked higher. It was thought that Deion was the one quarterbacking things behind the scenes at this year’s draft, but he has since revealed that it was Shedeur who may have rebuffed higher draft opportunities in Philadelphia and Baltimore because he didn’t want to sit behind two established starters, Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson – a pretty smart read as it turns out.\n\n“I know the fight behind the fight,” Deion Sanders said earlier this season. “I know what’s been transpiring behind the curtains, and I’m just proud of him. Because he’s not just saying the right things, he’s doing and living the right things. That’s just who he is … He’s a Sanders.”\n\nShedeur has only played in four NFL games, two of those against bad teams, which is too small a sample size to make concrete pronouncements about his career. But his performances so far for the Browns, a team who have sunk the careers of countless quarterbacks, hint that he is dramatically better than his lowly draft position suggests. And while his chance to finish out the season is the first true vote of confidence he has received since joining the organization, there’s a sense that he isn’t so much playing for his Browns future as he is playing for the chance to thrive elsewhere. That’s because the Browns made a $230m commitment to the injured Deshaun Watson and are determined to see if they can get their money’s worth when he returns to fitness. With this season long lost, really all that Shedeur has to play for is trade value, pride and teammate Myles Garrett shattering the single-season sack record – but of course that’s the popular spin.\n\nFor Shedeur, it’s just the latest chapter in a story that ends with him going down as the one of the biggest underdog success stories in sports – the draft afterthought who became an NFL legend. (Sound familiar?) That dissonance of an underdog with privilege shows the extent to which nepo babies have taken over the narrative.",
