    "fullText": "Warriors' recently acquired $60 million star named among NBA's most overrated players originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors may not have paired Stephen Curry with the star he envisioned playing alongside (Giannis Antetokounmpo), but a star is a star at this point.\n\nThe Warriors needed to add another high-caliber contributor to the roster after Jimmy Butler’s ACL injury, and they did just that before the Feb. 5 trade deadline. However, Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz believes the Dubs recently acquired 7-foot-2 star is among the most overrated players in the NBA right now.\n\n“Kristaps Porziņgis has the highest swing rating of any player on this list and is still a productive player when he's on the floor,” Swartz wrote Monday. “Therein lies the problem for the 30-year-old.”\n\n“Porziņgis continues to be plagued by injuries and is currently sidelined with left Achilles tendinitis. He's played just 17 total games for the Atlanta Hawks all season and just five since November. Porzingis was averaging just 45.4 healthy games over the last eight years coming into this season. Injuries have unfortunately robbed him of a potential Hall of Fame career.”\n\n“That didn't stop the Golden State Warriors from making Porziņgis their big trade deadline acquisition, however.”\n\nAccording to Swartz, Porzingis is the 4th most overrated player in the league right now. While Porzingis is unreliable at this stage of his career, he isn’t overrated. The former New York Knicks star is simply injury-prone, making it challenging for him to find a rhythm on the hardwood.\n\nIf Porzingis were regularly active and underperforming on both ends, Swartz would have a legitimate case for including the former lottery pick in the overrated category.\n\nHopefully, for the Warriors’ sake, Porzingis doesn’t experience any devastating injuries moving forward.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors sign 6-foot-5 former Lakers guard to assist Stephen Curry",

    "fullText": "Head coach Andy Farrell issued an impassioned plea for \"keyboard warriors to cop on and try to help\" Sam Prendergast and Jack Crowley amid a \"damaging\" narrative about Ireland's fly-half situation.\n\nCrowley played every minute of Ireland's triumphant 2024 Six Nations campaign and Prendergast has started all but one of the seven championship games since.\n\nPrendergast struggled in Ireland's win over Italy in Dublin on Saturday before being replaced by Crowley, whose high-tempo display leaves Farrell with another selection headache before facing England.\n\nFarrell said: \"Do you know what, I might be talking out of school here, but in my opinion for what's gone on over the last year or something, especially with the keyboard warriors, I think people need to ask themselves, really, sometimes, 'Are we Irish? Do we want people to do well or not?'\n\n\"Because it can be tough for these kids like, you know? It can be tough for these kids. I've seen it, to-ing and fro-ing with both of them, and both of them are strong characters.\n\n\"It takes a lot to break kids like that. But I've seen it affect people, you know. So the keyboard warriors on Twitter or whatever you call it now need to cop on and try and help these kids.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's damaging, you know.\"\n\nIreland survive Italy scare to claim first win\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nItaly captain Lamaro proud perception has changed\n\nFarrell praised Crowley's performance off the bench after the 26-year-old helped steer Ireland to victory against an impressive Italy side who led at half-time only to be denied their first Six Nations win in Dublin.\n\nHowever, Crowley's day ended in frustration when he kicked the ball dead as Ireland chased a last-gasp bonus-point try.\n\n\"He's gutted about the kick into the corner obviously but he did a lot more than that for us,\" added Farrell.\n\n\"He did a lot more good for us than harm and he can be proud of his performance today.\"\n\nOn Prendergast, who missed two conversion attempts, Farrell said: \"He'd be frustrated with bits.\n\n\"Down the line, these two lads, and others, they will be the players that they want to be. Everyone goes through these types of scenarios.\"\n\nPrendergast made his Ireland debut aged 21 in November 2024 but he and Crowley were overlooked by Farrell for last year's British and Irish Lions tour to Australia.\n\nHowever, when asked if he feels he thrust the Leinster player into the unforgiving rigours of Test rugby too early in his career, Farrell said: \"No, I've no problem at all. He was playing outstanding rugby and he will continue to do that.\"\n\nWhile he would have hoped for a more assertive display from Prendergast, there were positives for Farrell to take into Saturday's match against England.\n\nRobert Baloucoune marked his Six Nations debut with a decisive try and Stuart McCloskey notched two try assists in another all-action display in midfield, while Farrell described James Lowe's performance as \"outstanding\" after being dropped for the France defeat.\n\nBut Ireland will be wary of a strong response from England, whose early-tournament momentum was punctured by a resurgent Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday.\n\n\"You could say we have nothing to lose, but we do. We want to win. We want to play better,\" said Farrell, speaking before full-time in the Scotland v England game.",

If we got some other moments right, and didn't make the game of footy so hard on ourselves, the scoreline would have been much closer coming into the last 20.\n\n\"We were playing against good opponents in Wigan. They've been together a long time, they're well drilled and they know what they're doing.\n\n\"We knew we were in for a fight, but we were definitely up for it. We just didn't manage the game well at certain times.\"\n\nWigan Warriors head coach Matt Peet told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\n\"I'm pleased with the result, pleased with the performance, but there's room for improvement.\n\n\"It was probably just about right - I would have accepted that on the way over in terms of my thoughts on it.\n\n\"I liked the character. We were tested early on, it's a challenging place to come, a good team, a sticky pitch, so there was a bit to overcome - and we did.\"\n\nCastleford: Taaffe; Rawalawa, McIntosh, Mapapalangi, Qareqare; Asi, Weaver; Atoni, Hood, Lawler, Lane, Mellor, Stimson.\n\nInterchanges: Singleton, Westerman, Atkin, Hall\n\nWigan: Field; Eckersley, Keighran, Wardle, Marshall; French, Smith; Walters, O'Neill, Thompson, Nsemba, Farrell, Ellis.\n\nInterchanges: Havard, Mago, Partington, Farrimond.",

Known as a gritty, two-way player when healthy, he joins a Phoenix team that is 32-23 at the All-Star break -- 1.5 games out of the 5th seed.”\n\nHighsmith could have been a beneficial role player with the Warriors this season. Sure, the former Philadelphia 76ers forward hasn’t played yet this year due to a knee injury and is undoubtedly a risky investment.\n\nHowever, with the Warriors having limited buyout options and Highsmith emerging as a useful two-way wing the past couple of seasons, there’s no question that Golden State missed out on the 29-year-old.\n\nDuring his last full NBA campaign (2024-25), the Wheeling product averaged 6.5 points and 3.4 rebounds per game with the Miami Heat, shooting 45.8% from the field and 38.2% from three-point land.\n\nAfter Charania’s report, the Warriors will have no choice but to direct their attention to different buyout targets.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers get good Walker Kessler trade news",

E-40 has been spotted courtside at Golden State Warriors games, and he is a vocal San Francisco 49ers supporter. He created the song “Niner Gang,” which derives from the popular saying for their fans, “Bang, bang, Niner Gang.” When the San Francisco Giants were making World Series runs in the early 2010s, E-40 attended home games and traveled to road games to support.

    "fullText": "Golden State Warriors’ loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday would sting heavily, considering they were 16 points up in the third quarter. But their effort cannot be undermined either, with Draymond Green in particular, doing his absolute level best to contain Victor Wembanyama in the game. The way the game was called, however, left the Warriors legend disappointed.\n\nGreen scored 17 points on the night, and his defense on Wembanyama limited him to 26. It was enough for the Spurs, but in the roughly the first half of the game, life was made difficult for the Frenchman. Amidst their physical tussle, though, Wembanyamatoo tried to stop Green by going that extra leg, and at one point, had his arms wrapped completely around him.\n\nA fan pointed this out on social media platform threads, and called Doris Burke, who was commentator for the game, out. Green responded and didn’t hold back on his thoughts on her.\n\n“She will always ignore things happening to me and only half mention the good. And take shots when they are available. Been that way for a while,” Green replied.\n\nGreen has many enemies in the league. Most of them are players who’ve seen his ugly side when he resorts to fights on the court or reacts violently to relatively small incidents. Ask Rudy Gobert and Josef Nurkic. They may not admit it, but they would genuinely avoid altercations with Green.\n\nThis has not helped Green’s reputation among journalists and broadcasters. His ability is not in doubt, and people know how great a defender he can be. However, a chokehold on a multiple-time Defensive Player of the Year is something that becomes difficult to forget.\n\nThat said, commentary should not be biased either. Green has a right to be upset about the fact that Burke rarely says positive things about him, even when he is actually playing well. For instance, against the Spurs on Wednesday, it was one of his better nights of the 2025-26 season.\n\nA small acknowledgment of that would not have hurt and may have prevented this online dig at Burke.\n\nThe post Draymond Green Slams Doris Burke Over Biased Reporting, Using Broadcasts to “Take Shots” at Him appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "We explore the cosy world-building spin-off with Game Freak’s Shigeru Ohmori and his fellow developers – and learn how it began with a Pokémon-hunting dream\n\nPokémon is celebrating its 30th anniversary this month, and everybody knows what to expect from these games by now. The concept is simple: head into a cartoonish paradise full of whimsical creatures, capture them in red-and-white balls and assemble a team of warriors from them, before battling other aspiring Pokémon masters. But the latest entry in the series is different – a game that’s more about building than battling.\n\nIn Pokopia, a refreshingly pacific twist on the series, players are dropped into a virtual world where Pokémon are freed from their spherical prisons and happily roam their natural habitats. There’s one minor caveat – you have to create those habitats by hand, building them from what you can find.\n\nTaking its cues from Nintendo’s all-conquering Animal Crossing, this Switch 2 game sees you rebuilding decaying habitats in order to attract new Pokémon to move into your sanctuary. (Players of the Xbox classic Viva Piñata, rejoice.) It’s a welcome departure from the main series’ long-running training and battling loop. Veteran Pokémon developer Shigeru Ohmori, who started thinking about Pokopia’s concept while working on 2022’s Pokémon games Scarlet and Violet, says that the idea for Pokopia arose after spending many years dreaming about finding Pokémon in tall grass.\n\n“The first Pokémon game I worked on was [2003’s] Ruby and Sapphire,” recalls Ohmori with a smile. “My first project for that game was to create the map – and whenever I put grass on to the map, Pokémon appeared on screen. That feeling of Pokémon appearing when creating the habitat, and then meeting those Pokémon, was something that I really cherished.” He created a basic prototype for Pokopia in his spare time, and then Pokémon’s developers Game Freak brought on Dragon Quest Builders 2 studio Omega Force to help.\n\nThis feeling is lovingly recreated for players in Pokopia. As you create tufts of grass, a Bulbasaur suddenly appears, shuffling his way towards you to say hello. There are no humans to be found anywhere in this virtual utopia. In the strange and initially desolate patch in which you create your Pokémon paradise, you control the adorably wobbling mass of everyone’s favourite shape-shifting jelly, Ditto. Haunted by memories of its former trainer, Ditto decides to take a humanoid shape that you determine in a character creation screen. This is your uncanny-looking avatar, doing its best to approximate a faded memory of a human being.\n\nAfter you’ve customised your Ditto/human-hybrid, you are greeted by a sentient shrub, Professor Tangrowth, complete with a data disc attached to his curly tendrils and a pair of glasses strapped to his chin. The prof informs you that it’s your job to restore this barren land. Where do you begin? In exactly the same way that Ohmori did, all those years ago – by making lush, green grass.\n\nIn order to create new habitats, Ditto borrows moves from each new creature you meet, mimicking their abilities so that you can till the land. Bulbasaur’s ability transforms Ditto’s appendages into floppy, leaf-producing vines. Squirtle’s water gun sees Ditto puke water like a derpy Roman fountain, and Scyther’s cut blesses Ditto with comically oversized razor-sharp blades for arms. In a nice touch, whenever Ditto learns a new move you’re treated to the classic Pokémon level-up music.\n\nFor an hour I wander the barren wasteland, working to turn sand into grass and hacking trees for wood. Everything feels effortlessly charming, with a level of care and polish that elevates Pokopia’s opening 60 minutes above the series’ many middling spin-offs. Like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokopia also allows you to visit friends’ islands and meet their Poké pals, surfing between lands as a Ditto-Lapras or soaring through the skies in the form of a Dragonite.\n\nMarina Ayano, the game’s art director, tells me that she grew up with the franchise – making this something of a dream project. During development, Ayano and the sound director landed on two key words to steer the game’s cutesy and laid-back vibe: “chill and pop”. “Chill is slow and cosy, and pop ensures that everything is colourful … [we wanted] a very universal cuteness,” she says. As I make friends with a Pidgey, build a straw bed for a sleepy Charmander and field a request from an amusingly emo Umbreon who desires a black-painted home, it’s certainly very cute. For Ayano, Pokopia offered a chance to let the cutest Pokémon shine: creatures that are usually cast aside in the mainline games in favour of stronger battlers.\n\nPlaying as a Pokémon rather than the games’ usual human protagonists, you can fully understand – and converse with – every species of Pokémon, and given that Pokémon’s writing is normally pretty bland, the dialogue has unexpected personality. “Because there are no trainers in the game, we really thought about how the Pokémon communicate with each other,” says Takuto Edagawa, Pokopia’s director. “What are they thinking? How are they feeling? We made sure that if you put one piece of furniture anywhere in the world, Pokémon will react based on their personalities. I really liked how it came out.”\n\nPokopia is the first spin-off game that Game Freak has worked on directly, and Ohmori suggests that it may have influenced the direction of future mainline Pokémon games. “Battles have always been the focus, but there are so many [other elements] to these games, and I believe that fans have enjoyed these components as well,” he says. “I would like to show this more and scale the Pokémon games up, outside of battling. And I would like the Pokémon franchise to seek new possibilities to grow the Pokémon world.”\n\nPokopia is released on 5 March; £58.99/$69.99",

    "description": "Draymond Green opened up on finding out he was being floated in trade talks by the Golden State Warriors",
    "fullText": "Leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline, the Golden State Warriors were heavily featured in rumors surrounding a trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo. A deal for the two-time MVP ultimately never materialized, and he remains with the Milwaukee Bucks. However, during the reported trade discussions, the Warriors were faced with a difficult choice of potentially parting with either Draymond Green or Jimmy Butler for salary-matching purposes.\n\nDuring a recent episode of \"The Draymond Green Show,\" the veteran forward admitted that he'd had a conversation with Mike Dunleavy. Green recalled that Dunleavy explained that he could potentially be traded before the deadline, should a move for Giannis pick up pace.\n\n\"I called ,and he asked me about a couple of deals. What do you think of this deal? What do you think of that deal? ...And we talked for quite a while,\" Green said. \"And then he's like, 'And by the way, on Giannis' front, like, obviously we spoke to Giannis, spoke about Giannis. We've talked about what pics we'd send them.' We haven't talked about really the players that will go into the deal, but obviously If we were to do a deal with Giannis, you or Jimmy would have to be in the trade just to make it work. But we're not even there yet. We're not that far down the road. I'm not even sure it's going to happen anyway.\"\n\n\"'But just so you know, all the speculation out there and what people are saying, some of it's true.' I'm like, 'all right, cool.' But what it said to me in that moment was, okay, there's a chance I may get traded for Giannis because he didn't rule it out. He didn't say, we're not putting you in a deal. He said, there's a chance that you or Jimmy would have to go on a deal. So I took that ass, alright. It'll probably be me.\"\n\nGolden State ultimately landed Kristaps Porzingis via trade. Mike Dunleavy Jr. and Joe Lacob might explore a potential move for Giannis during the summer. But for now, Green's long-term partnership with the franchise is set to continue.\n\nWhether that changes in the summer remains to be seen. But, if both Stephen Curry and Porzingis can remain healthy, the Warriors should be capable of enjoying a potentially successful second half of the season and postseason run.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors' Draymond Green discusses being floated in trade talks",

    "fullText": "Golden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy was always going to face tough questions after what turned out to be an underwhelming trade deadline for Dub Nation. Many expected a blockbuster move for Giannis Antetokounmpo, but instead, the Warriors landed Kristaps Porzingis. Does that make them true contenders? Maybe not anymore, but that does not mean Dunleavy lacks confidence in his current group.\n\nThe season took a sharp turn for the worse when Jimmy Butler suffered a torn ACL that will sideline him for a year. That leaves Stephen Curry carrying an even heavier load to keep the Warriorscompetitive. The future Hall of Famer now finds himself more isolated than ever, especially with Draymond Green no longer performing at anything close to his prime level.\n\nSo, it was rumored that both Butler and Green were on the trade block in the Warriors’ attempt to get Giannis. When asked about the same in a recent interview, however, Dunleavy vehemently denied the same.\n\nThe reporters in attendance were trying to find out who exactly it was that the Warriors were okay with parting ways with, and Dunleavy got mad. Things got especially heated when someone, rather casually, declared that Draymond would have had to be a part of the deal to get Giannis to San Francisco.\n\n“No he wouldn’t,” Dunleavy responded. “You’re putting words in my mouth. So, that’s an unbelievable assumption.”\n\nIn most cases, reporters would take that as a cue to change the subject. But that person kept pressing on, asking the Warriors GM if it was Butler on the block instead. Unsurprisingly, it irked Dunleavy even more.\n\n“No, no. We’re not doing that. I’m not going down the roster talking about who’s in trades, who’s not. We don’t do that,” he declared, bringing the conversation to an end.\n\nWhat did raise eyebrows, however, was Draymond’s whole take on the matter. Of course, being a 14-year veteran and a franchise legend, he was talking to the front office about a potential Giannis deal. And according to his words on his podcast, Dunleavy told him that either Butler or he would have to be in a deal if the Greek were to come to the Bay.\n\nWhether Dunleavy would go ahead with that if the Bucks agreed will remain a mystery.

    "description": "The Golden State Warriors wouldn't have traded for Kristaps Porzingis if they didn't believe their medical staff could help him regularly take the court, coach Steve Kerr said Thursday.",
    "fullText": "PHOENIX - The Golden State Warriors wouldn't have traded for Kristaps Porzingis if they didn't believe their medical staff could help him regularly take - and stay on - the court, head coach Steve Kerr said Thursday. Though limited so far this season to 17 games with the Atlanta Hawks, his 18th will be on behalf of the Warriors and soon, they hope.\n\n\"There's a hope we can help him really get right,\" Kerr said at Mortgage Matchup Center before a 101-97 win over the Phoenix Suns, a day after Golden State acquired Porzingis in exchange for Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield.\n\n\"When he's right, he's a hell of a player.\"\n\nPorzingis is set to be introduced through a pregame news conference Saturday in Los Angeles. The oft-unavailable 30-year-old, 7-foot-2 Latvian sharpshooting, lob-dunking, shot-blocking center could help the Warriors salvage their sense of competitiveness the rest of the season.\n\nThat's at least what they were hopeful for Thursday after improving to 3-5 this year since Jimmy Butler tore his right ACL. The Warriors play the Lakers on Saturday, leaving home matchups with the Memphis Grizzlies (Monday) and San Antonio Spurs (Wednesday) before the All-Star break.\n\n\"He was the missing piece to a Boston championship,\" Draymond Green opined postgame. \"When he was with that team, they were really, really tough to beat. Hope that he can bring some of that here, but I like it. I think it'll be a great fit.\"\n\nPorzingis (playing the rest of the season on an expiring $30.7 million contract) isn't the missing piece to a championship this year for Golden State, positioned eighth (28-24) in the Western Conference with Stephen Curry shelved due to runner's knee. Kerr acknowledged the obvious Thursday: Its ceiling is lower this year without Butler, one of the NBA's premier forwards booked next week for ACL repair.\n\nThat said, Porzingis embodies the archetype of the center the smaller Warriors have long admired: a paint-protecting pick-and-pop threat who rolls for lobs while punishing switches. Contain the drive with two defenders and leave him open beyond the arc, where he's a 36.6% career 3-point shooter. Lose him rolling and he'll slam home lobs as one of the NBA's tallest players. Switch a guard or undersized wing and he'll go to work - blending force with a sense of finesse.\n\nIn 518 games for the New York Knicks, Dallas Mavericks, Washington Wizards, Celtics - with whom he won the title in 2024 - and Hawks, he's averaged 19.6 points (with a single-season career high of 23.2 points in 2022-23 and 7.7 rebounds as a primary, secondary and tertiary scorer. Golden State rosters two other centers - Al Horford and Quinten Post - with iterations of Porzingis' skills but without the upside he offers amid his proximity to his prime. Said one NBA scout: \"If Porzingis is healthy, is he better than Quinten Post? Yes. Does he get (the Warriors) over the hump? I don't think so. He's not an elite player.\"\n\nGreen is positioned to pair in the frontcourt beside Porzingis at power forward and highlighted his 3-point shooting - along with the way he exploits undersized defenders.\n\n\"Obviously, him and Jimmy are totally different players,\" Green explained. \"But that thing in particular, to add someone that, he gets the switch, you can throw it in there and punish him, that changes the offense.\"\n\nHis size and shot blocking change the defense.\n\nGreen expressed an eagerness to roam defensively beside Porzingis, who alters shots and deters attacks based on where he's stationed in the paint. Green started Thursday as a small-ball center and can blow up drives through timing and positioning, but playing next to a rim protector frees him to take more risks as a rover.\n\n\"When there's another rim protector out there, you can take those chances,\" he said. \"I've always enjoyed playing with another rim protector on the floor. I just think it really unlocks everything I can do defensively.\"\n\nKerr has experimented with double-big lineups and Horford played beside Porzingis during Boston's championship season of 2023-24. They've exchanged text messages since the trade and Horford knows how Porzingis can help.\n\nFor however long he's with the Warriors - and if and when he's on the court.\n\n\"Right away, his impact is going to be felt,\" Horford said. \"The guy can score the ball, can post … draw fouls. I just feel like he'll be in position to have some success.\"\n\nThis article originally published at How Kristaps Porzingis fits the Warriors: ‘His impact is going to be felt'.",

    "fullText": "Former Indiana University and Center Grove High School star and 2019 Indiana Mr. Basketball Trayce Jackson-Davis has been traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Toronto Raptors for a 2026 second-round pick according to several reports Wednesday night including one from ESPN's Shams Charania.\n\nJackson-Davis, a four-time All-Big Ten pick and 2022-23 consensus All-American at Indiana, averaged 6.6 points and 4.6 rebounds per game in 15.1 minutes per game in three seasons with the Warriors. He started 16 games as a rookie and 37 games last year in his second season, but he appeared in just 36 of the Warriors' 51 games this season and averaged 4.2 points and 3.1 rebounds per game in 11.4 minutes per game this season. The Warriors acquired Al Horford in the offseason and with him, Quinten Post, Draymond Green and others getting minutes at center, Jackson-Davis spent much of the season out of the mix.\n\nThe Warriors also acquired center Kristaps Porzingis from the Hawks for former Pacers guard Buddy Hield and forward Jonathan Kuminga on Wednesday, so moving Jackson-Davis opens up space for Porzingis, who has missed the last 12 games with Achilles tendinitis.\n\nJackson-Davis is one of several players with Indiana ties who have changed NBA teams prior to the trade deadline. Former Purdue, Mishawaka Marian and La Lumiere star Jaden Ivey was traded from the Pistons to the Bulls earlier this week. Former Park Tudor and La Lumiere star Jaren Jackson Jr. was traded along with former IPFW star Jon Konchar from the Grizzlies to the Jazz. Former Lawrence North and Ohio State star Mike Conley Jr. has been traded twice from the Timberwolves to the Bulls and then from the Bulls to the Hornets and might end up being waived and returning to the Timberwolves.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Trayce Jackson-Davis, ex-Indiana basketball star, traded from Warriors to Raptors",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Shortly after helping the Philadelphia 76ers knock off the Golden State Warriors 113-94 on Tuesday for the team's fifth-straight win, rookie guard VJ Edgecombe sat at his locker smiling. This comes after yet another impressive performance for one of the gam's dynamic young guards.\n\nA night after shooting just 1-for-11 in Monday's win over the Los Angeles Clippers to start the team's 5-game road trip, Edgecombe had 25 points on 11-for-20 shooting against the Warriors. There was nothing coach Steve Kerr and Co. could do against the No. 3 overall pick as he made sure the Sixers were in the best position to win the game.\n\nWith that being said, the fact that Edgecombe was able to shake off such a tough performance in LA was an impressive showing. Yes, the Warriors are a scuffling group a bit, but the rookie continues to make strides.\n\n\"I'm gonna be honest, I just flushed it,\" Edgecombe said. \"Last night, I just missed a bunch of open shots. It happens. It happens to everybody. Not every night you gonna make all the shots. Last night (Monday), I was 1-for-11. I missed 10 shots. I was like, 'You know what? I'm not gonna sit here and soak in it, I'm not gonna mope around.' My teammates have extra faith in me, and they literally told me tonight, 'You're due for a good game.'\"\n\nThe rookie guard is a relentless worker. He has a thirst to be great and it's shown on a nightly basis. The Sixers also have real faith in him that he can get going no matter what is going on. The confidence from his team along with the confidence he already has in himself makes him a tough kid.\n\n\"I trust my work,\" Edgecombe said. \"I know I work hard. It's just confidence. It's all confidence. I got my teammates, especially. Once your teammates are trusting you, man, I feel like we can just go out there and go hoop. I don't even have to worry about anything. I don't have to worry if they care if you miss it, you know what I'm saying? At the end of the day, it's a team game. They know I'm gonna make the right plays. Yeah, they just have a ton of faith in me, and I just go out there and go hoop.\"\n\nEdgecombe and the Sixers will now head back to Los Angeles to face the Lakers on Thursday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers' VJ Edgecombe explains his confidence after win over Warriors",

For this article, we begin with the third of nine players who wore the No. 43 jersey for the Warriors.\n\nThat player would be Golden State forward alum Larry McNeill. After ending his college career at Marquette, McNeill was picked up with the 25th overall selection of the 1973 NBA Draft by the (then) Kansas City-Omaha (now, Sacramento) Kings.\n\nThe Hoke, North Carolina native played the first three seasons of his pro career with the Kings. He would also play for (then) New York (now, Brooklyn) Nets, before he signed with the Dubs in 1977. His stay with the team lasted until he was cut by the team that fall.\n\nDuring his time suiting up for the Warriors, McNeill wore only jersey No. 43 and put up 4.5 points and 2.5 rebounds per game\n\nAll stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors jersey history - No. 43 - Larry McNeill (1977)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nGolden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. is the man tasked with potentially trading for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nAs it turns out, these guys go way back.\n\nThe Athletic's Nick Friedell relayed an amazing flashback story about the pair dating back to Dunleavy's late playing days.\n\nBack in 2015, Dunleavy, then a swingman for the Chicago Bulls, lined up for a 3-pointer late in the second quarter of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals against the Milwaukee Bucks. As he rose to take a shot from the left side of the floor, a 20-year-old 7-footer from the Bucks came charging at him well after the ball had left Dunleavy’s hands.\n\nThe force of the contact, in which the Bucks’ big man took a running head start from the center of the floor and trucked into Dunleavy’s midsection with his right forearm, sent the veteran sharpshooter into the Bradley Center’s courtside seats right next to Bucks co–owner Wes Edens and his daughter, Mallory.\n\nThe young Bucks big man, a second-year player from Greece, was upset Dunleavy had taken a shot at his teammate Michael Carter-Williams’ face earlier in the game. He had also been pushed to the ground by Dunleavy seconds before, and his actions earned him a flagrant 2 foul and an ejection from the game. His name?\n\nMORE: Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel set all-time NBA record as Duke rookie foes\n\n“I got no issues with the guy,” Dunleavy said in May 2015, via Friedell. “Nice kid, young kid, going to be a really good player. Doesn’t change my feeling on wanting to get over to Mykonos.”\n\nMORE: Cavs' Nae'Qwan Tomlin didn't even play high school basketball\n\nIt would be quite the full-circle moment, for sure.\n\nIt appears the Bucks would be willing to trade Giannis before the Feb. 5 deadline, or maybe in the summer.\n\nGolden State's best chance to maximize the aging Steph Curry would be to get Antetokounmpo immediately, so as not to miss out on this playoff run.\n\nIf a trade does happen, it'll certainly create some entertaining conversations between Dunleavy and Antetokounmpo.\n\nLakers have the weirdest LeBron-Luka problem\n\n76ers facing a $149 million Joel Embiid contract nightmare\n\nDonovan Mitchell tied a LeBron James record with the Cavs\n\nHow Dillon Brooks is much more than a LeBron hater\n\nCharles Barkley rips NBC and Michael Jordan\n\nThere are 450 players in the NBA, and Lonzo Ball is 460th in field goal percentage",

I’m saying they’re not good at basketball, so focus on hoops,” Brooks said.\n\nThe remark was a clear shot at Green, whose podcast has become one of the most visible player-led platforms in the NBA.\n\nRather than focusing on specific games or moments, Brooks framed his criticism around commitment and performance.\n\nThe tension between Brooks and Green stretches back several seasons.\n\nIt became most visible during the 2022 NBA playoffs, when Brooks’ Memphis Grizzlies faced Green’s Golden State Warriors in a heated second-round series.\n\nThat matchup featured repeated verbal exchanges, physical play, and Brooks’ now-infamous “poke the bear” comments directed at the defending champions.\n\nGreen, a key part of four Warriors championship teams, responded at the time by questioning Brooks’ impact and playoff credentials.\n\nSince then, the two have traded indirect jabs through interviews and media appearances, even after Brooks moved on from Memphis.\n\nBrooks’ latest comments suggest that while the teams have changed, the personal edge has not.

After the game, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said he didn't believe Curry's knee injury was \"anything major,\" but the team will know more on Saturday.\n\nCurry went to the locker room near the end of the third quarter, grimacing and limping slightly after some awkward contact on an and-1. He remained in the locker room at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and the Warriors soon ruled him out for the rest of the game.\n\nAnd that's an AND-ONE\n\n📺 @NBCSAuthentic pic.twitter.com/OFR7kYte2V\n\n— Golden State Warriors (@warriors) January 31, 2026\n\nThe Warriors managed to hang around despite Curry's injury, cutting the deficit to three points midway through the fourth quarter, but ended up losing 131-124 to the East-leading Pistons.\n\n[\nCurry had been dealing with a knee issue over the course of this week. He reportedly first felt something in his knee on Saturday and was listed as questionable with right knee soreness for Sunday's game, but still played that day. However, he did miss Monday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers, the second leg of a back-to-back.\n\nHe went on to play 28 minutes against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday and didn't carry an injury designation going into Friday's game, but clearly the injury resurfaced.\n\nAs usual, a significant Curry injury would be the last thing the Warriors need right now. The team is still learning how to navigate life without Jimmy Butler, who was knocked out for the season by a torn ACL last week.\n\nFriday's loss means Golden State is now 2-4 since Butler's injury, with losses to the Toronto Raptors and Dallas Mavericks. For now, they remain in eighth place in the Western Conference at 27-33, with a 3.5 game cushion to avoid the second play-in game.",

    "fullText": "The future of Giannis Antetokounmpo is an open question among NBA fans and teams alike. The two-time MVP is reportedly available for trade, either ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline or during the summer. Of course, the Golden State Warriors have been cited as a potential suitor, primarily due to how well Giannis and Stephen Curry would potentially fit on the court.\n\nDuring a recent episode of \"The Draymond Green Show\" podcast, Green discussed Golden State's reported interest in Giannis, admitting that he only knows what's being put out by the media, just like the rest of us.\n\n“As of yesterday, everybody’s talking Giannis. Do the Warriors make a trade for Giannis? This is not the podcast where you find that out,” Green said. “I actually don’t have a (expletive) clue. I have no idea. I know what you know — exactly what I saw in red, which is the same thing you saw in red. So I have no clue...I did see that Giannis is preparing for an exit from Milwaukee. Whether that’s at the deadline or the offseason, apparently, it’s inevitable and it’s going to happen.”\n\nGolden State is in need of another superstar talent, especially now that Jimmy Butler has been ruled out for the rest of the season following an ACL injury. Adding Giannis would all but guarantee Golden State would be re-established as one of the top contenders for a championship, both this season and in the years to come.\n\nNevertheless, the Warriors won't be the only team fighting for Giannis in the trade market. When a player of his caliber is available, a bidding war is inevitable. Fortunately, the Warriors have a deep trove of tradable assets, both in terms of draft picks and young, high-upside players. Whether Mike Dunleavy and Joe Lacob can get a deal over the line, either ahead of the trade deadline or during the summer, will remain to be seen.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors' Draymond Green addresses Giannis Antetokounmpo rumors",

The Munster centre broke through off a first-phase scrum move from inside his own half and showed terrific pace to burn the cover defence on the outside to score.\n\nFor the first time in the contest, Warriors were wobbling and when they messed up a lineout near their own 22, Gleeson reacted first to gather and race away to score.\n\nThe pendulum had swung towards the Irish side and when Kilgallen crossed for their fourth try, it was a six-point game.\n\nIn a rare move for Glasgow, Lancaster knocked over a three-pointer to ease the nerves around Scotstoun and ensure Warriors locked up the victory.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: McKay; Rowe, McDowall (c), Yule, Smith; Lancaster, Afshar; Bhatti, Stephen, Walker, Craig, Oguntibeju, Ferrie, Fraser, Miller.\n\nReplacements: Stewart, McBeth, Talakai, Cockburn, Vailanu, Duncan, Oliver, Urwin.\n\nMunster Rugby: Haley; Abrahams, Daly, Kelly, Kilgallen; Butler, Coughlan; Wycherley, Barron (C), Jager, O'Connell, Wycherley, Edogbo, Quinn, Gleeson.\n\nReplacements: Barron, Donnelly, Ryan, Coombes, O'Donoghue, Patterson, Wood, O'Brien.",

    "fullText": "Yes, the Warriors can trade for both Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James. Here's how originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Giannis Antetokounmpo sweepstakes are officially here.\n\nESPN's Shams Charania reported on Wednesday that two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo is \"ready for a new home\" with the Bucks listening to offers ahead of the February 5 trade deadline.\n\nAs you might imagine, it didn't take long for the rumor mill and NBA content machine to crank into hyper drive with seemingly half the league mentioned as a possible suitor. The Heat, Timberwolves, Hawks, Knicks, 76ers, Rockets, Nets and several others have all been most prominently linked to the 31-year-old future Hall of Famer. They all might be tough-pressed to match the Warriors if Mike Dunleavy Jr. puts Golden State's best foot forward.\n\nThat the Warriors are interested in Antetokounmpo should come as no surprise.\n\nWith Jimmy Butler's season-ending torn ACL, Jonathan Kuminga's trade demand, Draymond Green's unwavering commitment to drama-inducing behavior, Steve Kerr's future beyond this season in doubt and Stephen Curry's open frustration with the state of the organization, Golden State's short- and long-term prospects are hanging perilously in the balance.\n\nMORE:Ranking the best Giannis landing spots\n\nOn its own merit, pushing the chips in for Antetokounmpo would be a seismic move unto itself.\n\nBut what if the Warriors dared to dream even bigger? What if Golden State decided that acquiring the Greek Freak wasn't enough to vault back into contention? What if Joe Lacob decided to go for broke and also make a play for LeBron James?\n\nImagine the thought of a Curry-James pick and roll with Giannis waiting in the dunker spot. You'd watch, I'd watch and the those three on the same team would instantly command the respect of every other title contender... regardless of what Curry himself thinks of a potential trade.\n\nThe math works and neither the restrictive aprons nor salary caps would get in the way.\n\nHere is a hypothetical (REPEAT: HYPOTHETICAL) three-team trade that works.\n\n(Editor's note: Fanspo's NBA trade machine is by far the best one out there with updated picks, salaries, restrictions and specific conditional feedback on why trades do or don't work).\n\nWarriors get: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Thanasis Antetokounmpo\n\nLakers get: Draymond Green, Myles Turner, Will Richard\n\nBucks get: 4 future first-round picks, 3 pick swaps, Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, Quentin Post\n\nMilwaukee badly needs to restock its draft capital if its going to enter a full rebuild. And of the teams potentially in the market for Giannis, only the Nets can rival Golden State's war chest of future picks.\n\nThe Warriors can offer up to four first-round picks along with three additional swaps. Only three are listed above as the Warriors have a top-20 protected 2030 pick owed to Washington (if that pick falls between 1-20, in this scenario it would go to Milwaukee).\n\nThe Bucks would be hedging against the Warriors' long-term future with picks out as far as 2032 when Curry would be 43, Antetokounmpo 37 and James well into retirement.\n\nButler would presumably be trade bait for next season on an expiring contract, potentially fetching additional draft compensation though his $56.8 million salary would be difficult to move. Kuminga presents an interesting low-risk upside play while this trade also allows them to move off a sizeable and lengthy commitment to Myles Turner.\n\nMORE: Tracking latest Giannis trade rumors\n\nIf the Warriors stand pat, its a signal they are content to ride out Curry's career as a middling fringe playoff or play-in team.\n\nMoving out the picks for Antetokounmpo immediately extends Golden State's window. Such is the reality when you have two of the NBA's top seven players on your roster.\n\nThe LeBron James piece of the equation is where things get really interesting. That bloated $52.6 salary complicates the money going out and Golden State's most realistic path towards getting James after sending out the money required to bring back Antetokounmpo is to include Draymond Green.\n\nThe Warriors could, instead of Green, cobble enough salary to send the Lakers between Buddy Hield, Al Horford and Moses Moody but doing some would strip what little depth remains in the first place. While breaking up the Curry-Green pairing would hurt, its also difficult to imagine Green fitting in at all offensively with Curry, Antetokounmpo AND James.\n\nThat Curry-Green chemistry can't be replicated but if there's one player on the planet with the IQ to pull off a reasonably proxy overnight, its James. Golden State would probably want some assurances that James would come back for at least one more full season, but even if he doesn't, there's not much tread left on Green's tires either.\n\nBeyond the basketball fit, one also wonders if its simply time. If Kerr and the organization at large is simply worn down and ready to move on, perhaps swapping out Green for James may inject some energy back into Steve Kerr.\n\nMORE:Klay Thompson's dad weighed in on the Giannis rumors\n\nThere's a growing sense of frustration within the Lakers and that was before ESPN's bombshell about the Buss family and potential turbulence with the James relationship.\n\nIn this scenario, the Lakers functionally swap James for Turner and Green in a frontcourt overhaul. Both Turner and Green offer significant upgrades defensively, Turner offers some stretchiness from the 5 to open things up for Luka Doncic and Green would surely be motivated to play with an Everest-sized chip on his shoulder.\n\nMORE:LeBron admits 'no way' he imagined playing on Lakers for 8 years\n\nTurner is under contract for three more seasons with the third a player option while Green owns a player option for next season. Moving James now, even for players with longer commitments, also means they won't have the discount haggling sure to happen this season with James and agent Rich Paul. There are already reports that the Lakers would ask James to take a significant discount, something he's in the past shown no willingness to consider.\n\nIf the Lakers did say yes, it probably also means finding a taker for Deandre Ayton who has an $8 million player option for next year but will surely opt out. If the Lakers could turn Ayton into another shooter, they would fully hand the on-ball keys to Doncic and Austin Reaves with more complementary pieces around the fringes.\n\nIs that more exciting than having LeBron James? Absolutely not. But it does give JJ Redick more outs and roster flexibility.\n\nThere's a million reasons trades like this never happen. It's a massive reset involving three teams with onerous contracts, bloated egos, luxury tax and apron implications and so much more.\n\nWill this happen? Almost assuredly not.\n\nCan it happen? Anything is impossible!",

Curry finished with 27 points after an eight-point first half on 2-of-7 shooting, following in the second half with 5-of-7 shooting and 7-of-8 free-throw shooting.\n\nMoses Moody added 26 points (9-of-15 shooting, 5-of-9 from 3-point range) and Golden State rode eight double-figure scorers for 53.5% shooting, 23-of-54 3-point shooting and 38 assists for 42 baskets.\n\nUtah star forward Lauri Markkanen had 18 points on 6-of-14 shooting while Bryce Sensabaugh scored a team-high 22 points.\n\nThe Warriors (27-22) made 15 first-half threes – a season high for any half – on their way to a 68-55 lead: three apiece from Moody and Hield (during an 11-point, four-minute, second-quarter furry), two from Curry, Melton and Quinten Post and one from Al Horford, Brandin Podziemski and Will Richard.\n\nSharp ball and player movement opened jumpers and active defense forced 11 turnovers in the opening half. Keyonte George attacked for 12 first-half points to keep the Jazz within striking distance, but Markkanen was hounded off the bounce or in the paint en route to 2-of-8 shooting.\n\nCurry widened Golden State's lead to 22 with a 12-point third-quarter burst via two cutting layups, a pullup three, three free throws from a 3-point shooting foul and two free throws from a foul on a drive. A 99-82 advantage was cut with an 11-2 quarter-closing run from the Jazz (15-33), who started it with a triple from George (19 points) and capped with Isaiah Collier's buzzer-beating fastbreak layup.\n\nRichard and Moody started the fourth quarter with back-to-back triples to restore Golden State's double-figure lead.\n\nThe Warriors next play Friday against the Eastern Conference-leading Detroit Pistons at Chase Center.\n\nThis article originally published at Warriors on target from distance, end four-game trip with rout of Jazz.",

Behind a high-powered offensive performance, the Warriors rolled to a 140-124 win over the Jazz to end their four-game road trip.\n\nEight members of the Warriors tallied double-figures on Wednesday with Curry leading the way.

Moody drilled a game-high five 3-pointers in 26 minutes against the Jazz. Moody has now tallied 10 or more points in nine straight games for the Warriors. Over that nine-game span, Moody is averaging 15.2 points per contest.\n\nThe Warriors buried 23 3-pointers on Wednesday, with seven members of the Warriors tallying two or more made triples.

    "description": "The NBA released the list of participants for the Castrol Rising Stars for the 2026 All-Star Weekend. A list intended to celebrate the league’s future stars turned into disrespect for Golden State Warriors fans.",
    "fullText": "The NBA released the list of participants for the Castrol Rising Stars for the 2026 All-Star Weekend. A list intended to celebrate the league’s future stars turned into disrespect for Golden State Warriors fans. With multiple teams getting more than one selection on both rookie and sophomore teams, Dub Nation found not even one of theirs on the list.\n\nTwo years ago, Brandin Podziemski was the sole selection for the Warriors. Last year, their representation increased to two players. This year, the Warriors were among the 15 teams without representation on the sophomore and rookie lists. The Dub Nation is one of the proudest fan bases, and giving them no representation invited voices calling out the league. “Not one Warrior smh,” a fan wrote, expressing discontent with the selection.\n\nLet’s not forget, they were the most dominant team of the last decade, and produced stars like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. So, being denied entry into the list would surely warrant outrage from the fanbase. They were particularly upset with their rookie, Will Richard, getting no recognition.\n\nIn the past, several notable names haven’t made the Rising Star selection. Cam Whitmore, Tari Eason and Andrew Nembhard, who are gradually making their mark in the league, all missed the selection in 2024.\n\nIsaiah Collier, one of the best bench players in the league, was one of the missing names last year. These past snubs have also attracted similar outrage from fans on social media.\n\nThe Warriors fans’ discontent extended beyond representation. They boldly called out the league, with a fan demanding respect for one of their rookies. “Respect Will Richard.” The sentiment is certainly not baseless. The No. 56 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft has vastly outperformed expectations. He made his debut with a 13-point performance.\n\nRichard has emerged as a consistent contributor from the bench. Steve Kerr has shown trust in him, and he won over fans in his first game. He plays on both ends, and his defensive mindset has earned him Rookie of the Year praise from fans on social media. “Will Richard snubbed,” a Warriors fan bluntly called out the selection.\n\nHowever, it’s not only Warriors fans who had an issue with the lack of representation. Remember Hugo Gonzalez, Joe Mazzulla’s instinctive weapon? “Hugo Gonzalez snubbed,” a Celtics fan was clearly upset with his name not being selected. Gonzalez became an instant favorite among the Celtics fans after he made the game-tying 3-pointer to send the game against the Brooklyn Nets into double overtime.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors had one selection. Collin Murray-Boyles, the rookie from Gamecocks, had slowly gotten himself into the starter’s role in the absence of Jakob Pöltl. However, a Raptors fan took issue with one player’s absence from the sophomore roster.\n\n“Where is Jamal Shead?” one fan pointed out. Shead has emerged as the primary backup point guard for the Raptors this season. He is only behind Isaiah Collier for the most bench assists this season. Raptors fans’ issue with him being snubbed was perhaps warranted.\n\nAce Bailey was one of the biggest snubs in the selection. He is the only player from the top 9 rookie selections from 2025 who didn’t make the cut. With Utah having no players on either team, some felt he should have made it.\n\nHowever, with just 21 slots available, deserving players missing out is perhaps unavoidable. However, does it seal a player’s fate? Absolutely not.\n\nThe post Dub Nation Demands Respect After Warriors Star Is Snubbed in NBA Rising Stars Announcement appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said his team won a \"bizarre, sad\" game at the Minnesota Timberwolves in a \"sombre atmosphere\" after the fatal shooting of an intensive care nurse by immigration agents in Minneapolis.\n\nThe death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti on Saturday was the second time in less than a month an American citizen has been killed by federal agents in the city, and has sparked angry protests both locally and in other parts of the US.\n\nThe Timberwolves held a minute's silence for Pretti before Sunday's game, which was punctuated by anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) chants from fans.\n\nAn ICE operation in Minnesota ordered by President Donald Trump's administration has been going on for more than six weeks. ICE agents have the power to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally.\n\nRenee Good, another Minnesota resident, was shot and killed by an ICE agent on 7 January.\n\n\"Honestly, what I felt was that [the Timberwolves'] group was suffering,\" said Kerr after the Warriors' 111-85 win.\n\n\"It was one of the most bizarre, sad games I've ever been a part of. You could feel the sombre atmosphere.\n\n\"Their team, we could tell they were struggling with everything that's been going on. And what the city has been through. So it was a very sad night.\"\n\nWarriors forward Moses Moody, who scored 19 points with eight rebounds and two blocked shots, said you could \"feel the weight of the city\" during the match, which had been postponed for 24 hours after Pretti's death.\n\n\"I couldn't imagine too many different times where that large amount of people are together in the midst of a situation like this, so you definitely felt that,\" said Moody.\n\nStephen Curry led the scoring for the Warriors with 26 points to climb level with Paul Pierce at 19th on the all-time scoring list - finishing the game with 26,397.\n\nAnthony Edwards scored 32 points and recorded 11 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who lost a fifth-straight match.",

    "fullText": "While Minnesota is supercharged with emotions, Stephen Curry demonstrated physical grit of his own. Before he lent heartfelt support to the grieving community that’s rattled by the death of Alex Pretti on Saturday (the day the game was originally scheduled for), Curry led the Warriors to a 111-85 win. All while powering through injuries, getting hurt again, and adding another historic knotch to his resume.\n\nCurry revealed he was following the goings-on in Minnesota while he spent Saturday resting his knee after the game was cancelled. He was listed as questionable before Sunday’s rescheduled game. But he played 28 minutes and was instrumental in the Dubs’ turnaround. Another player stepped on his toe, but that didn’t seem to slow him down.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the Dubs and Wolves have a back-to-back rematch tomorrow. When asked if he would be available tomorrow, Curry said, “If everything goes well, yeah. With the recovery and all that, the minutes tonight weren’t crazy, so hopefully I respond well.”\n\nWhen the Golden State Warriors landed in Minnesota yesterday, some of the players got their workouts in before the game was canceled. The point guard hurt his knee during that. “Kind of something flared up yesterday when we came over to get a workout in. It was super weird,” he revealed.\n\nBut his personal injury update is a lot more concerning when he reveals some persistent issues. “I’ve had stuff going on with quads and whatnot, but it was something that I hadn’t felt before. So, I definitely took advantage of the day off to get right, but hopefully that continues.”\n\nAfter Jimmy Butler’s season-ending ACL tear, followed by Jonathan Kuminga’s indefinite break for bone bruising, the last thing Dub Nation can deal with is an injured Steph. Tomorrow De’Anthony Melton and Al Horford sit out for injury management and fans wouldn’t mind if Steph joined them. Moving up the all-time scoring ladder can wait a little longer.\n\nDespite battling injuries, Stephen Curry had an impressive 26 points, 2 rebounds, 7 assists, and 4 steals. That alone carried him to the 19th spot on the NBA’s All-time Scoring list. He passed John Havlicek and tied Paul Pierce for cracking the top 20 with 26,397 points in his career.\n\nHe’s only 99 points away from catching up to Tim Duncan next. So far this season, Curry has averaged 27.3 points, 5.0 assists, and 3.7 rebounds while shooting 46.8% from the field and 39.8% from the arc.\n\nAnalysts predict he’d crack top 10 soon enough. They, in fact, think he would’ve done it a long time ago had it not been for his injury history that also kept him underpaid for a period of time.\n\nTonight, Curry limped during the empty moments and yet he carried the offense. If he aggravates what is now a sore knee and ends up missing more than one game, the Warriors’ offense will be diminished.\n\nFor now even Steve Kerr is hopeful that Curry will be cleared to play. Steph is still listed as questionable for Monday and they’ve left his status as a game-time decision.\n\nThe post Stephen Curry Shares Worrying Injury Update After Historic NBA Achievement Against Timberwolves appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Chris Finch's voice cracked and faltered as the coach expressed on behalf of the Minnesota Timberwolves their heartbreak for the community's collective fear and pain from the ongoing immigration crackdown, following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a federal officer.\n\nFinch presents a straightforward, no-nonsense approach in his public statements and rarely reveals much emotion, but he was clearly moved by the situation in Minneapolis before his team hosted Golden State on Sunday. The game between the Timberwolves and Warriors was postponed by 24 hours, after Pretti was killed on Saturday.\n\n“I’m more than a resident. This is my home. I love living here. I love being a part of this community. I’ve been embraced from day one. People have been amazing. It’s sad to watch what is happening,” said Finch, who was hired by the Timberwolves five years ago. “On the human level, certainly as somebody who takes great pride in being here, I know a lot of our players feel the same. They all love being here, and it’s just hard to watch what we’re going through.”\n\nThe Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti prior to the national anthem, just as they did for Renee Good before their game on Jan. 8, the day after she was fatally shot by a federal officer. The Trump administration in December launched what the Department of Homeland Security declared the largest immigration enforcement operation in history and earlier this month announced a surge of more officers to push their force past 2,000.\n\nThe NBA announced Saturday that the rescheduling decision was made to “prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community” after Pretti was killed during a confrontation in a commercial district less than 2 miles south of Target Center. Finch said on Sunday that the Timberwolves pushed for the postponement to respect the public grieving process.\n\n“Playing basketball just didn't feel like the right thing to do,” Finch said, thanking the NBA and the Warriors for their support.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr, long one of the league's most outspoken coaches, was measured but clearly moved as he expressed his own sympathy.\n\n“This has always been a great stop on the NBA tour. I love the city of Minneapolis. People here are wonderful, and it’s very sad what’s happening. I feel for the city. There’s a pall that’s been cast over the city. You can feel it. A lot of people are suffering, and obviously a loss of life is the number one concern. Those families will never get their family members back,” Kerr said.\n\nTens of thousands of people swarmed downtown Minneapolis on Friday in protest of the tactics and presence of immigration officers, a crowd the Warriors could see from their hotel as it moved toward Target Center. A smaller protest march took place downtown before the game Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of other voices being raised around the sports world on Sunday. Women's basketball star Breanna Stewart held a sign with \"abolish ICE\" printed on it during introductions at her Unrivaled league game. Minnesota Frost fans during a PWHL game chanted “Ice out now!” The NBA Players Association issued a statement in support of the protests in Minnesota and urged its members to speak up.\n\nThe perspectives in a polarized country vary wildly on what constitutes constitutionally protected protesting and what becomes violent political disruption, and Kerr seemed to sense that tension as he spoke before the game on Sunday.\n\n“People are so angry. There should be an appeal to our better angels to look after one another and to recognize what’s happening. We’re being divided by media for profit, by misinformation. There’s so much out there that is really difficult for all of us to sort of reconcile,” Kerr said. “And so in times like these you have to lean on values and who you are and who you want to be, either as an individual or a country.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) – Waverly basketball has started the season with a 9-2 record, including a win against Lansing Sexton in the “Battle for Michigan Ave.” The Warriors’ success has earned them our Team of the Week award.\n\nSenior leadership is one of the biggest reasons for Waverly’s success so far this season, according to Waverly basketball coach Rod Watts. Derek Thomas II had a team-high 28 points in their win over Lansing Sexton on Saturday. Xavier Pendergrass finished with 17 points.\n\nWatts described Thomas and Pendergrass as forces in the paint and how important it is for his team to feed them early, to establish dominance and get his two playmakers going.\n\n“When you don’t feed the guys inside, they get frustrated and we get frustrated and I get frustrated,” explained Watts. “They may tend not to work for you, so got to feed them early and I think the outside will open up. So this is one of the things got to focus on.”\n\nWaverly is currently on a five-game winning streak and Thomas says he feels this is just the tip of the iceberg for how good he feels his team can be.\n\n“We had dropped two, so going on this win streak to start the year of 2026, it feels really good,” said Thomas. “We feel like we have our best games ahead of us.”\n\nWaverly will look to make it six wins in a row when they face Lansing Everett on January 23rd at 7:00p.m.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere are just two more weeks until the NBA trade deadline on Feb. 5, and one trending topic centers on Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr.\n\nThe playoffs are a far stretch for the Nets, who currently sit at 12-30, so Brooklyn has been heavily involved in trade rumors. Specifically with All-Star hopeful Michael Porter Jr.\n\nAfter being traded from the Denver Nuggets to Brooklyn this offseason, Porter Jr. has become a number-one option for a team for the first time in his career. This has made him a player who's been brought up in rumors. Let's take a look.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors have been teams to watch in a trade involving the Nets' forward, but these talks have slowed down.\n\n\"It no longer appears as if pursuing Porter is a path the Warriors would like to go down in the wake of Butler's injury,\" Brett Siegel of ClutchPoints said. \"The Los Angeles Lakers possibly throwing their hat in the mix for Porter isn't a realistic possibility and something they don't have a desire to do, sources said.\"\n\nAlthough Michael Porter Jr. is on pace for career-highs in points (25.3), rebounds (7.4), and assists (3.2) this season, the contract that is linked to him has made teams uninterested in trading for the 27-year-old.\n\nPorter Jr. has two years remaining on the five-year, $179.2 million deal he signed back in 2021 with the Nuggets.\n\nIt's looking like neither team is interested in picking up the contract of Porter Jr., so a trade is looking less and less likely.\n\nNets take tanking to the next level, ending 10-year drought with this horrific stat\n\nWill the Nets trade Cam Thomas at the NBA trade deadline?\n\nJordi Fernandez demands better physicality from Brooklyn Nets rookie Egor Demin\n\nWarriors trade idea swaps Jonathan Kuminga for 25.7 PPG scorer in All-Star conversation",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO — Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga finally was called off the bench and into action during a 145-127 loss to the Toronto Raptors at Chase Center on Tuesday night.\n\nOn the second night of a back-to-back — with the Warriors now having to go forward without Jimmy Butler, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear Monday night — head coach Steve Kerr said he would look more toward his bench depth, including Kuminga who hadn't played in 16 games due to a coach's decision.\n\nKuminga received a roar from the Chase Center crowd when he subbed into the game to start the second quarter of the contest.\n\nHe finished with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 21 minutes. He added five rebounds and two assists. Teammate Buddy Hield led the team in scoring with 25 points off then bench, including a perfect 6-of-6 from deep, in 19 minutes of play.\n\nThe Warriors were down 41-28 after the first quarter before Kuminga was subbed into the game to start the second period.\n\nIn his first stint, a little under five minutes, Kuminga missed his only shot attempt: An alley-oop tip-in on a pass from Draymond Green. He was fouled but missed both free throws. He managed to grab two rebounds in his limited action.\n\nHis plus/minus was a minus-10 in four minutes and 39 seconds of playing time.\n\nGolden State is looking for a spark from their bench depth after Butler was lost for the season with a torn ACL.\n\nKerr said the Warriors' win over the Miami Heat that Kuminga could see the floor following Butler's devastating injury.\n\n\"Sure, absolutely,\" Kerr said responding to a question about Kuminga playing against Toronto.\n\nWarriors trailed 91-63 when Kuminga returned to the game at the 6:12 mark of the third quarter.\n\nHe scored 12 points in the period, throwing down a ferocious two-handed slam off an alley-oop pass from Green, a couple of mid-range shots through contact and going the length of the court to make a buzzer-beating layup to end the third.\n\nGolden State trailed 108-94 at the end of three quarters. Kuminga played the remainder of the quarter since subbing in at the 6:12 mark and was a plus-4 after the period.\n\nKuminga played the entire fourth quarter as his play continued to help the Warriors to cut into that huge double-digit deficit. It was cut to as low as 11 points.\n\nHowever, the Raptors ran the score back up late and held on to win the game.\n\nHere are Kuminga's average statistics so far though the 2025-26 regular season, prior to Tuesday's game against the Raptors:\n\nThese are Kuminga's career averages through five seasons in the NBA, prior to Tuesday's game against the Raptors:\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jonathan Kuminga returns to court in Warriors' loss to Raptors",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors haven’t succeeded in avoiding the injury bug thus far.\n\nThe Warriors’ star point guard, Stephen Curry, has missed several contests due to quadricep and ankle setbacks, causing the franchise’s offense to suffer on the hardwood.\n\nOn Monday, Jimmy suffered an apparent knee injury against the Miami Heat that looked horrible in real time and on replay.\n\nEssentially, Butler came down awkwardly as he was preparing to finish around the rim and was forced to exit the contest in the third quarter.\n\nAlthough one may argue that it’s too early for Warriors fans to begin panicking, the fact that the six-time All-Star could’t walk off the floor without assistance from his teammates suggests that he could be dealing with a significant injury.\n\nIf Butler is unable to return to action anytime soon, it’s safe to say Curry will have to return to his superhuman ways for the Dubs to survive moving forward.\n\nJonathan Kuminga hasn't played in a game with the Warriors in a month, and the organization’s key role players (Moses Moody, Brandin Podziemski, Quentin Post, Will Richard, etc.) can’t be relied upon to be high-level complementary pieces alongside Curry nightly.\n\nHopefully, Butler, who’s averaging 20.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game on 51.9% field goal shooting and 38.1% three-point shooting this season, isn’t dealing with a season/career-altering injury.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors predicted to reunite with beloved $109 million NBA champion via Jonathan Kuminga trade",

    "fullText": "After knocking down a barrage of 3-pointers in their blowout win over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night, the Golden State Warriors picked up right where they left off on Monday evening with the Miami Heat in town.\n\nLed by former Heat All-Star forward Jimmy Butler, the Warriors came out swinging. Butler tallied 13 first-quarter points to lead the Warriors to a 36-34 lead in the opening frame. Despite Butler's early run, the Heat didn't go away, thanks to former Warrior Andrew Wiggins.\n\nIn his first game back at Chase Center since being traded at the deadline last year, Wiggins tallied 18 first-half points against his former team. With Butler and Wiggins trading buckets, the Warriors were able to cling to a four-point advantage at the first half whistle.\n\nIn the third quarter, Chase Center went quiet as Butler appeared to suffer a knee injury. Butler landed awkwardly on his right knee and went to the ground in pain. Butler exited the game and went to the locker room before being ruled out for the remainder of the game with a right knee injury. After the game, the Warriors revealed that Butler is undergoing an MRI on his knee.\n\nFollowing Butler's injury, the Warriors picked up their teammate with a game-swinging run. At the time of Butler's injury, the Warriors held a two-point lead with under eight minutes remaining in the third quarter.\n\nThe Warriors went on a 12-0 run to take a commanding 15-point lead. Behind their third-quarter run and Brandin Podziemski's fiery finish to the game, the Warriors were able to pull away for a 135-112 win.\n\nPodziemski led the Warriors with 24 points on 9-of-19 shooting from the field with a trio of 3-pointers to go along with six boards and four assists in 30 minutes off the bench. Podziemski scored 17 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nAlong with Podziemski and Butler, the Warriors had five other players tally double-figure scoring numbers on Monday. Six different players hit two or more 3-pointers against the Heat for 24 made 3-pointers. The Warriors have now drilled 20 or more 3-pointers in their last four games.\n\nThe Warriors have now posted a 6-1 record during their eight-game homestand.

    "fullText": "The Knicks were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 126-113 on Thursday night at the Chase Center.\n\n- The Knicks were without Jalen Brunson due to an ankle injury, but they did receive a nice boost, as Landry Shamet was finally deemed ready to return after missing the last 25 games with a dislocated shoulder. Shamet didn't jump back into the starting lineup, though, as it was Miles McBride who slid in in Brunson's place.\n\n- New York was able to get off to a much better start coming off one of their worst offensive performances of the season on Wednesday in Sacramento. Every starter recorded a bucket and they knocked down six of their first seven shots from behind the arc to open a quick double-digit advantage (15-5).\n\nShamet was the first man off the bench halfway through the first, and he immediately knocked down his first shot.\n\n- The Knicks pushed the lead out to as many as 17 points, but Karl-Anthony Towns was forced to the bench after picking up a pair of early fouls, and Golden State was able to flip the momentum. The home team used a 13-2 run to cut the deficit all the way back down to five at the end of the opening quarter (35-30).\n\n- Towns had five points and a game-high six rebounds in the first before being forced to the bench. The big man continued his domination into the second, picking up four more boards and a pair of putback buckets to help keep the slim lead midway through a back-and-forth middle quarter (46-44).\n\n- The Warriors took their first lead minutes later, and they were able to keep it at three heading into the break (62-59). Jimmy Butler led the way with 15 points on 7-of-10 shooting, KAT racked up a first-half double-double, and Mikal Bridges led the Knicks with 12 points.\n\n- Steph Curry didn't make a three during the first half (0-for-5), but it didn't take long for him to snap that skid in the third. The All-Star sharpshooter knocked down his first two coming out of the break as part of a Golden State 13-2 barrage, helping them quickly push the lead out to 11 points (78-67).\n\nMoses Moody added two more triples, giving him seven on the night and a season-high 21 points.\n\n- Each time it looked like the Knicks were ready to take back some of the momentum, the Warriors responded right back. New York simply could not get consecutive stops when they needed them the most, and they found themselves trailing by 12 points heading into the final frame.\n\n- Curry's big second half continued into the fourth, but the Knicks refused to go away, and they used a 10-2 run to get the deficit back down to nine points with just over four minutes remaining. Golden State's hot shooting couldn't be slowed down the stretch, though, and they held on for the victory.\n\nThe Warriors shot 54 percent from the field and 44 percent from behind the arc in the game.\n\n- McBride took advantage of the start with 25 points, Anunoby had 25 as well, Bridges had 21, and Towns had 17 and 20 boards. Shamet knocked down just two of his seven shots in his return and Jordan Clarkson chipped in 11 points, but the rest of the bench combined for just one point.\n\nButler led all scorers with 32 points, Curry had 27, Moody finished with 21 and Brandin Podziemski had 17 off the bench.\n\nCurry got hot after a slow start, making big shots to put this one away late.\n\nKAT 👌 pic.twitter.com/eQNzt8fXJE\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 16, 2026\n\nWelcome back Landry Shamet! pic.twitter.com/6e05v7nXIi\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 16, 2026\n\nThe Knicks return home to MSG to host the Phoenix Suns on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.",

Kings guard Keon Ellis, regarded as a superb defenders, would join Porter in Golden State as the Warriors eye another title for their dynastic core.\n\nThe Kings would get Kuminga and Moses Moody to spearhead their rebuild while shipping Zach LaVine's contract back to Brooklyn, where the Nets could easily absorb it.\n\nThe deal would work financially.

    "fullText": "Following months of turmoil and speculation, 23-year-old forward Jonathan Kuminga has reportedly demanded a trade away from the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAfter signing a new contract this past offseason, Kuminga was not eligible to get traded until January 15. Now that the date has arrived, according to ESPN's Shams Charania and Anthony Slater, the former No. 7 overall pick is now asking his front office for a new home.\n\nThere are not a ton of options that make sense right now, and this could eventually lead to Kuminga simply staying in Golden State. But based on the current market, here are a few ideas that could at least intrigue all parties.\n\nTrade idea: Jonathan Kuminga and draft capital for Malik Monk and Keon Ellis\n\nAccording to The Athletic, while the Kings previously offered the Warriors veteran guard Malik Monk and a top-12 protected pick in the 2030 NBA Draft, that is \"no longer in play\" anymore.\n\nGolden State is reportedly telling teams they only want deals that expire after this season, however, they may have interest in Sacramento's Keon Ellis.\n\nOther reports have speculated that while the Kings would welcome Kuminga, a transaction involving these two teams would likely require a third team.\n\nTrade idea: Jonathan Kuminga, De'Anthony Melton, one first-round pick for Trey Murphy III\n\nHere is more from Charania and Slater about interest from the Pelicans:\n\n\"They've been fond of Trey Murphy III in the past, but the New Orleans Pelicans are rebuffing calls about all of their young wings, league sources said.\n\nIf the right star player is made available, the Warriors would be willing to move multiple first-round draft picks, team sources said, though they are more protective of their first-rounders in 2028 and beyond than their 2026 pick.\"\n\nMurphy is a great fit for the Warriors and likely worth sacrificing draft capital, which the Pelicans could use after trading their first-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nTrade idea: Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht for Jonathan Kuminga\n\nThis trade was suggested by Sam Quinn on The Third Apron podcast with Yossi Gozlan.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, another potential suitor for Kuminga is the Lakers.\n\n\"League and team sources confirmed a report that the Lakers have some interest in Kuminga, though it remains unclear if talks will unfold. The Warriors, the sources said, are aware of the intrigue and waiting to see how that situation evolves.\"\n\nOne reason this trade works is because Hachimura's salary comes off the books after this season, and the Lakers are expected to \"monitor the situation\" involving Kuminga.\n\nTrade idea: Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield for Klay Thompson and Daniel Gafford\n\nWhile the Mavericks are linked to Kuminga, there are not a lot of trade packages that make sense.\n\nHere is more from Jake Fischer (via The Stein Line):\n\nYet the links between Dallas and Kuminga have mostly stemmed from Golden State's interest in the aforementioned Davis, who is now out indefinitely with ligament damage in his left hand and widely regarded, as a result, to be out of trade consideration until the offseason.\n\nThis option is fun because it brings Klay Thompson back to the Bay Area, provides floor-spacing for Cooper Flagg, and could give Dallas an interesting weapon with some upside to their rotation.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Jonathan Kuminga trade rumors: 3 perfect proposals for the Warriors",

    "fullText": "Proposed Warriors trade sends $148.5 million championship duo to 76ers for nine-time All-Star originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf the Golden State Warriors value their slim championship window, they’ll maximize the rest of the trade season.\n\nThere’s no question that trade is needed in the Bay, and with the Dubs possessing enough appealing assets to land a game-changing contributor, they shouldn’t hesitate to make a move sooner rather than later.\n\nIn an alluring trade idea created by Sports Illustrated’s Bryan Toporek, the Dubs would send their $148.5 million championship duo to the Philadelphia 76ers for a nine-time All-Star.\n\n“While the Warriors are now posturing about their willingness to keep (Jonathan) Kuminga past the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline and shop him around in the offseason, it would be in all parties' best interest for Kuminga to find a new home in the next few weeks,” Toporek wrote Thursday.\n\n“Could the Sixers get in on the bidding? Never say never with Sixers team president Daryl Morey, particularly when it comes to buying low on a potentially high-ceiling player. However, Kuminga's current contract and the Sixers' top-heavy salary structure would make it challenging.”\n\n“Kuminga is earning $22.5 million this season. The Sixers have only three players earning more than that: Joel Embiid ($55.2 million), Paul George ($51.6 million), and Tyrese Maxey ($38.0 million).”\n\n“The Warriors did pursue a sign-and-trade with George during the 2024 offseason before he signed with the Sixers, but they'd almost have to include Draymond Green ($25.9 million) in any George deal for salary-matching reasons, which is likely a non-starter for them.”\n\nWhile George’s burst off the dribble and elite scoring prowess are no longer elite, the Fresno State product can still be a positive asset on the hardwood when healthy.\n\nGeorge, who signed a four-year deal with the 76ers in 2025 and has served as the franchise’s No. 3 scoring option, is contributing 16.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game this season while shooting 41.5% from the field and 37.1% from deep.\n\nHowever, with the Warriors being hesitant to part with Green, their do-it-all forward who’s helped them win four championships since the start of the 2014-15 season, there’s a good chance the Dubs and 76ers won’t become trade partners.\n\nMore NBA: Jalen Brunson injury looks like bad news for Knicks",

    "fullText": "Jonathan Kuminga trade rumors: The three-team trade that gets the Warriors the best shooter on the market originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJonathan Kuminga and the Warriors are nearing their end point. The former No. 7 pick of the 2021 draft has only played in five games since Nov. 14, and he's widely expected to get moved soon.\n\nKuminga simply doesn't fit well in Steve Kerr's system. The team knew it when they gave him a two-year, $48.5 million deal with a team option on the second year. As part of that contract, Kuminga had to waive an automatic no-trade clause, making it easier to deal him on Jan. 15 when he becomes trade-eligible.\n\nNow that the Warriors are able to move him, a trade should be coming shortly. His market isn't particularly robust. He hasn't had a good year, and his defensive and feel issues have become all the more prominent. He does have some promise though as a bully ball scorer who can get to the line a ton.\n\nThe Kings are the only team who have been mentioned so far as serious suitors. The issue is that they don't have veterans who the Warriors want back. That makes a three-team trade the most likely outcome. Here is the one that makes the most sense, giving Golden State one last gasp at building something special around Stephen Curry.\n\nMORE: The NBA's biggest surprises in the season's first half\n\nThe Warriors need some more offensive firepower around Curry and Jimmy Butler. Their young players haven't developed enough, and they're missing that electric shooting next to Curry that Klay Thompson provided back in their championship days.\n\nThose types of All-Stars aren't available often, and certainly not at the price that Golden State can afford. Michael Porter Jr. is the exception. He's playing well enough to make his first All-Star team this year. Here's how to get him on the Warriors.\n\nWarriors receive: Michael Porter Jr., Keon Ellis, Tyrese Martin\n\nKings receive: Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody, Buddy Hield\n\nNets receive: Zach LaVine, Devin Carter, 2026 first round pick (via Warriors), 2028 first round pick (via Kings)\n\nNot many people are paying attention to the Nets, who are one of the bottom five teams in the league. MPJ's massive development has thus gone under the radar. He's always been a terrific jump shooter. That hasn't changed — he's hitting close to 40 percent of his 3's.\n\nWhat has changed is everything else. Porter is averaging a career-high 26 points per game in a much larger role than the one he had as a complementary player to Nikola Jokic. He's proving that he can be the No. 1 scoring option on a team.\n\nPorter's not a great defender, but he does have 6-foot-10 height that the perpetually undersized Warriors could use. He's rebounding the ball well, as he always has.\n\nThe big change to his game is that he's actually passing the ball. In Denver, he was a black hole. In Brooklyn, he's averaging a career-high 3.4 assists per game and carrying the Nets to way more wins than that roster deserves.\n\nGolden State badly needs that offensive juice. It falls apart whenever Curry is off the floor. Porter could carry those minutes, as he has in Brooklyn. He is also one of the rare elite scorers who has shown that he is more than capable playing off the ball, as he did while helping the Nuggets to the 2023 title.\n\nKeon Ellis would also be a great add. He's the one player on the Kings who is intriguing. Ellis is a terrific perimeter defender who gets a ton of steals and raises a team's ceiling. He hasn't played nearly enough in Sacramento, much to the chagrin of their fans. He's not a good shot creator, but playing on the Warriors would hide that particular weakness.\n\nThe cost here for the Warriors isn't too bad. Kuminga doesn't hold much trade value. Moses Moody is a good role player who doesn't play huge minutes. Buddy Hield's hot-and-cold play has been mostly cold this year. And that 2026 pick should be somewhere in the late teens or early 20's.\n\nPorter wouldn't be worth this price a year ago, when he was seen as overpaid. He has proven increased his value, and this is a good opportunity for a 27-year-old talent who could lead the next great Warriors team after Curry is gone.\n\nMORE: Fixing the Warriors with a 3-team trade featuring LaMelo Ball and Zion Williamson\n\nThe Kings need to break up their team. As Zach LaVine recently told Dunc'd On's Nate Duncan about their roster, \"The music, if that's what you guys are going for, you can have the most talented people in the world, but if the guitarist and the violin guy, and then somebody that is orchestrating, and somebody on the saxophone, if they are all not playing in the same key, it ain't going to sound like music. It is going to sound like a bunch of instruments playing.\"\n\nSacramento would love to be off LaVine's deal, which will pay him $49 million next year if he opts into the final year of his contract as is widely expected. That contract does not hold positive value, which explains why the Kings would have to give up a 2028 first round pick to the Nets.\n\nAs for the other pieces involved, Devin Carter was a 2023 lottery pick but hasn't been able to carve out a role for himself. Ellis hasn't played a huge role either. Sacramento could easily afford to part ways with those three players.\n\nThe Kings would get two young prospects back to begin to retool their roster. Kuminga could finally get a chance for a bigger role, carrying much more of the offensive load than he did with the Warriors. Moody could also get more minutes on a Sacramento roster that is starved for capable two-way players. This would also foster a reunion with old friend Buddy Hield, who had his best scoring years there.\n\nThis is Sacramento's best shot at getting Kuminga while also shedding LaVine's contract. Ellis and a first round pick is a fair price to pay.\n\nWhen the Nets first acquired Porter, the plan was to try and move him later in the year. That may have changed given how well he's played. He's young enough that they could keep him and try to re-sign him as a focal point of their team. If they were to move him, then they'd have to get a very good offer in return.\n\nThis package is precisely that. The Kings' 2028 pick should be a good one. Sacramento probably won't be able to rebuild fast enough to get out of the lottery by then. The Warriors pick won't be quite as juicy, but this is a good draft class and the Nets should be able to find a rotation player with a pick in the middle of the first round.\n\nThe players that the Nets are getting back aren't too shabby either. LaVine doesn't have much of a market right now due to how much he's paid, but he is inarguably a great scorer. Brooklyn could use the same strategy that they used with Porter, trying to rehabilitate his value and flip him next year when he's on an expiring contract. And Carter has only been in the league for two years. He still has some value as a reclamation project.\n\nPossibly the biggest reason why the Nets say yes to this trade is that Porter has been too good for them. They were supposed to be the worst team in the league and have a great shot at landing one of the three stars in the 2026 draft. Porter has dragged them to too many wins. In trading him, they would be adding two picks, selling high on a player with injury risk, and increasing their chances at landing a franchise-changing talent this summer.\n\nMORE: Ranking 9 most likely stars to be traded, from Giannis to AD",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMost of the talk last offseason regarding the Warriors was around what would happen with RFA Jonathan Kuminga.\n\nIt seemed like Kuminga and the Warriors were looking to go their separate ways, but it was a rough market for Kuminga and other RFAs, so he ended up agreeing to a two-year deal with the Warriors.\n\nDespite the two sides coming to a compromise in the offseason, we could expect Kuminga to be in his final days with the franchise, with a transaction happening sooner rather than later.\n\nTo start, since Kuminga had signed a new contract this summer, the team had to wait a certain amount of time before he was eligible to be traded this season.\n\nThe restriction on when he can be traded is lifted on Thursday this week, meaning he could technically be traded as soon as tomorrow.\n\nMORE: This might finally be the year the Bulls trade Nikola Vucevic at the deadline\n\nThe contract the Warriors gave Kuminga was certainly a short-term deal meant to get the two sides to a temporary solution, as it was evident that was the best that could be done at the time.\n\nThe Warriors find themselves just three games over .500 right now, and only have so much time left to capitalize on a window with Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler.\n\nKuminga hasn't been the only player on Golden State swirling around in trade rumors, so the Warriors could look to get aggressive in search of a second-half of the season surge.\n\nThere's a team option on Kuminga's contract for next season, which is another indicator that the Warriors wanted flexibility in how they deal with Kuminga and his contract.\n\nMORE: Raptors have interest in Domantas Sabonis, but would only give up these 3 players\n\nAs of now, it appears that the Kings remain the team with interest in Kuminga (per Michael Scotto), but that was the case this summer, and no deal was facilitated.\n\nThings could change, though, as the Warriors might choose to move on from Kuminga even if they don't get the exact desired return they hoped for.\n\nHowever, with the deadline quickly approaching and Kuminga eligible to be traded starting Thursday, more serious talks could materialize over the coming days and weeks around a new home for Kuminga.\n\nLeBron James' injury news means one of the NBA's most impressive streaks could be over\n\nWhy Knicks fans will have to root for New York villain Trae Young on the Wizards\n\nCeltics' Jaylen Brown has sarcastic wish granted, gets hefty fine after latest comments\n\nCaitlin Clark gives two-word reaction to Celtics backup center's recent success\n\nTrading for Ja Morant may be impossible for one key reason\n\nCeltics use hilarious NBA 2K data method to prepare for Raptors game",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are counting down the days until Jonathan Kuminga is trade-eligible.\n\nWhen Jan. 15 arrives, the Dubs will have the luxury of exploring franchise-bolstering trades involving the 6-foot-7 NBA champion forward. In a hypothetical three-team deal centered around Kuminga, Golden State would land a 27-year-old ex-Denver Nuggets star.\n\n“The Warriors have not exactly been shy about making their stance on trading Jonathan Kuminga known, and on paper, a trade structure between them and the (Brooklyn) Nets should be pretty straightforward,” ClutchPoints’ Jedd Pagaduan wrote Sunday.\n\n“Alas, the Nets haven't been very interested in Kuminga anyway, which might call into necessity the involvement of a third team. Thankfully for both teams, there is a franchise that remainshead over heels for Kuminga in the Sacramento Kings. That still seems to be Kuminga's likeliest destination, as the franchise currently in shambles has an opening for a primary scoring option, which he could fill in theory.\n\n“To that end, here is a workable three-team trade proposal that satisfies the Warriors, Nets, and Kings' demands (Michael Porter Jr to the Warriors, Zach LaVine, Devin Carter, Buddy Hield, and three future draft picks to the Nets, and Kuminga, Terance Mann, and Moses Moody to the Kings.”\n\nPorter has been on the Warriors’ radar since the 2024-25 trade season. The Missouri product’s deadeye three-point shooting makes him one of the prolific long-range weapons the NBA has to offer.\n\nSince leaving the Nuggets this past offseason, Porter has not only continued to set the nets on fire but also taken his scoring to the next level (thanks to the Nets allowing him to assume No. 1 scorer/playmaking responsibilities).\n\nPorter is contributing 25.9 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game with Brooklyn this season, shooting 49.0% from the field and 39.7% from three-point land.\n\nIn an ideal world, the Warriors would find a way to poach Porter from the Nets and get back on track as a franchise.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors predicted to cut ties with underachieving $86.2 million duo via trade",

    "description": "There was likely a familial relation between two of the fallen warriors—father and son—but the third body’s tie to the two was more unclear.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAmateur archaeologists in Hungary discovered three 1,100-year-old burials of a trio of warriors.\n\nTwo of the warriors were teenagers at the time of their death and a third was likely the father of the youngest warrior.\n\nA range of high-status grave goods was discovered with the burials, including silver, gold, and weapons.\n\nVolunteer archaeologists in Hungary discovered the 1,100-year-old bodies of a trio of warriors—along with not only some unique familial ties among the deceased, but also plenty of elite-level artifacts with gold, silver, and ancient weaponry.\n\nDiscovered outside of Akasztó in Hungary, over 55 miles from Budapest, the three warriors’ graves were dated to the 920s or 930s C.E., a key moment in the Hungarian conquest. Located by volunteers from the Kecskemét Soldier József Museum’s community archaeology program, the bodies were found during an excavation led by archaeologists with the museum.\n\nThe first grave belonged to a warrior who was between 17 and 18 years old at the time of his death, according to a translated statement from the Pulszky Society Hungarian Museum Association. He was certainly part of an elite class, as the grave goods included a silver tarsoly plate, one of only about 30 that have been found in the Carpathian Basin.\n\nThe plate was enough to indicate an elite status for the teenage warrior, but the grave also contained a gold ring set with blue glass stones still on the deceased’s left hand, two gold hoops in his hair, and decorative silver arm and leg rings. The grave itself featured silk, leather, and wooden elements that the experts hope to continue to analyze.\n\nThe warrior’s horse had an interesting final rite as well. The animal—at least the head, legs, and hide—were included in the burial alongside a gilded silver harness. Experts, though, believe the rest of the horse was eaten during the funeral rites or at least burned during the event.\n\nThe museum officials called it “great fortune” the tomb was not robbed, as it is one of the “richest burials in the Tisza region.”\n\nA second tomb held an even younger warrior, likely just 15 or 16 years old. His grave included a bow and a quiver with seven arrows, according to Live Science. Decorative antler plates highlighted the bow handles.\n\nThe third grave featured archery equipment as well, alongside a 10th-century saber. Experts believe the warrior in the third grave was between 30 and 35 years old and likely the father of the youngest warrior, although they believe all three were probably related in some way. The older warrior also had a silver bracelet and a coin-adorned horse harness. In all, the archaeologists uncovered 81 coins, mostly from northern Italy, which the warriors could have obtained while fighting there.\n\nThe museum’s experts said that while all three were likely connected genetically, they may have also been connected through battle, and the father-son duo may have been the first warrior’s bodyguards.\n\nEarly analysis of all three bodies showed they enjoyed a diet high in animal proteins, but there were no clues as to the cause of death of the warrior trio.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

A rolling line-out maul was sent towards the Zebre line, scrum-half Ben Afshar peeled off and drew the defence before popping inside for McDowall to glide over untouched.\n\nFull-back Smith continued his excellent recent form with a fabulous second try, showing tremendous pace and footwork to slice through the defence and go in under the sticks.\n\nZebre struck against the run of play when Bertaccini crossed, but Glasgow re-established the two-score advantage just before half-time when hooker Stephen finished off a driving maul.\n\nThe Italians were not done yet and powered a rolling maul over the line for substitute hooker Quattrini to dot down.\n\nWarriors dampened the visitors' enthusiasm with a brilliantly engineered fourth try to seal the bonus point.\n\nSome exquisite handling created space for Duncan Munn to deftly chip ahead and nobody was beating Dobie in the race to the corner. Weir, having entered the action a few minutes earlier, banged over the conversion from the touchline.\n\nGlasgow used the maul to great effect once again to send substitute Hiddleston over for try number five.\n\nThe sixth almost raised the Scotstoun roof as Dobie made a searing break up the touchline, stepped inside and found Weir to send the club great over for one final try before he moves into an academy coaching role.\n\nDobie added another to round off a very satisfying evening for Franco Smith's side.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: Smith, Munn, McDowall, Yule, Dobie, Hastings, Afshar, Schickerling, Stephen, Richardson, Oguntibeju, Williamson, Ferrie, Darge, Duncan.\n\nReplacements: Hiddleston, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Miller, Oliver, Weir, Lancaster.\n\nZebre: Pani, Belloni, Bertaccini, Lucchin, Batista, Roger, Dominguez, Buonfiglio, Klein, Pieretto, Canali, Carrera, Volpi, Bianchi, Ruggeri.\n\nReplacements: Quattrini, Franceschetto, Nocera, Milano, Odiase, Prinsloo, Montemauri, Morisi.",

(AP) — Stephen Curry scored 26 points in his annual homecoming game in Charlotte, and Golden State defeated the Hornets 132-125 in front of 19,685, the largest crowd ever at the Spectrum Center.\n\nBrandon Podziemski and Jimmy Butler each had 19 points for the Warriors, who’ve won five of six games. Gui Santos added 13 points off the bench, hitting three 3s for Golden State, which went 24 of 49 from beyond the arc.\n\nBrandon Miller led Charlotte with 33 points, while LaMelo Ball finished with 27, going 7 of 10 from 3-point range. Rookie Kon Knueppel added 20 points in his return from a one-game absence because of a sprained ankle.\n\nCharlotte played without starters Miles Bridges and Ryan Kalkbrenner because of injuries.\n\nThe Warriors led 69-64 lead at halftime behind four 3s and 15 points from Curry — who grew up in Charlotte and played college ball at nearby Davidson — and appeared on the verge of blowing out the Hornets after starting the third quarter on a 10-0 run. But Charlotte quickly turned the tables with Ball hitting three 3s, helping the Hornets put together a 32-12 run to take the lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe momentum swung back to the Warriors after Podziemski knocked down two 3s to open the fourth.\n\nThe Warriors held the lead throughout the rest of the fourth quarter and Draymond Green’s tip-in off a Curry miss from deep with 1 minute remaining pushed the lead to six. Butler hit two free throws with 17 seconds left to seal the win.\n\nPodziemski finished 5 of 7 from 3-point range, including a leaning 3-pointer off one foot to beat the shot clock.\n\nThe Hornets lost despite outscoring the Warriors 56-32 in the paint.\n\nATLANTA (AP) — Jalen Johnson scored 34 points and Atlanta overcame Anthony Edwards’ 30 points for Minnesota to beat the Timberwolves and end a seven-game losing streak.\n\nAtlanta took control by outscoring Minnesota 37-23 in the second quarter to lead 70-49 at halftime.\n\nJohnson added 10 rebounds and six assists. Onyeka Okongwu had 17 points and Dyson Daniels added 11 points, eight rebounds and nine assists. Daniels also had two steals and two blocks.\n\nThe Hawks claimed their first win since beating Philadelphia 120-117 on Dec. 14 and improved to 6-11 at home.\n\nThe Hawks were bolstered by the return of Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 16 points in 17 minutes off the bench after missing 10 games with an illness.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Paolo Banchero had 29 points and 10 rebounds and hit the go-ahead basket with 7.5 seconds remaining as Orlando rallied from a 10-point, third-quarter deficit and beat Indiana, sending the Pacers to their 10th consecutive loss.\n\nAs the clock was winding down in regulation, Banchero backed down Aaron Nesmith and banked home an 11-foot shot for the final basket in a game that included 12 ties and 11 lead changes. The power forward finished 12 of 21 from the field and 5 for 7 at the line.\n\nNesmith missed a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 3.1 seconds remaining.\n\nOrlando’s Desmond Bane scored 18, Anthony Black added 15 and former Pacers center Goga Bitadze 14.\n\nThe Magic (19-15), who have been without leading scorer Franz Wagner (22.7 points per game) since Dec. 7 due to a high-ankle sprain, welcomed back point guard Jalen Suggs from a seven-game absence with a hip issue. Suggs had 11 points and three assists.\n\nThe Pacers have the NBA’s worst record at 6-28. The 10-game losing streak matches the fifth-longest in franchise history.\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell scored 34 points, Darius Garland added 19 and Cleveland pulled away in the fourth quarter to defeat Phoenix to snap its four-game winning streak.\n\nIt was Mitchell’s 18th 30-point game this season, third-most in the league, after he had only 10 points in Monday night’s win at San Antonio. The All-Star guard — fourth in the league in scoring at 29.7 points per game — was 10 of 18 from the field, including four 3-pointers, and also had 10 rebounds and seven assists in 30 minutes.\n\nJaylon Tyson had 18 points and Sam Merrill added 16. Evan Mobley (16 points, 10 rebounds) and Jarrett Allen (16 points, 11 rebounds) both had double-doubles.\n\nCleveland has won two straight and improved to 19-16 after going 7-7 in December.\n\nDevin Booker led Phoenix with 32 points, including 20 in the third quarter as the Suns rallied from a 67-54 halftime deficit to get within two late in the quarter. Dillon Brooks had 20 points, all in the first half, and Collin Gillespie added 17.\n\nAfter Phoenix got within 91-89 on a pair of free throws by Jordan Goodwin, the Cavaliers regained control with a 24-5 run as Mitchell scored eight points and Tyson added six. Cleveland was 10 of 13 from the field while Phoenix went 2 of 10.\n\nCleveland’s largest lead was 24 points at 125-101 with less than four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nPhoenix had an 8-5 lead before the Cavaliers scored 16 straight points, including four straight 3-pointers.\n\nThe Suns go into 2026 with a 19-14 record after going 7-5 in December.",

You have to go back to 2016 to find a season with more tryless games.\n\nThe changing of the coach may not be a panacea. But who dictates and implements the culture at a club? Who is responsible for the style of play? Who chooses the players and the supporting coaching staff? We can't change the squad en masse so that leaves one option whether it fits the narrative or not.\n\nEdinburgh need a coach with drive and a sense of purpose because we are rudderless and only our lack of direction is preventing us from running aground entirely.\n\nSandy Smith can be found at The Burgh Watch",

Curry spent 13 seasons as one half of the infamous “Splash Brothers” duo, alongside Thompson. The 3-point chucking pair helped lead the Warriors to four championships in seven seasons.\n\nCurry rocking Thompson’s signature shoes is a fitting way to pay homage to his former teammate, while playing against him, as The Dallas Morning News’ Mike Curtis noted.\n\n“Didn’t notice this until now, but sneaker free agent Stephen Curry is wearing Klay Thompson’s shoes by ANTA,” Curtis reported.\n\nDidn’t notice this until now, but sneaker free agent Stephen Curry is wearing Klay Thompson’s shoes by ANTA. pic.twitter.com/Ih0F69O5wn\n\n— Mike Curtis (@MikeACurtis2) December 25, 2025\n\nCurry became the 22nd player in NBA history to score 26,000+ points in his career in the third quarter of the Warriors’ 10-point win against the Mavs.\n\n26,000 CAREER POINTS FOR STEPH CURRY!\n\nThe 22nd player in NBA history to reach that mark 🤩 pic.twitter.com/JBX4zU0UiA\n\nCurry finished with 23 points on 6-of-18 shooting and a perfect 9-for-9 from the free-throw line. He also finished with four assists and three rebounds. Klay Thompson scored seven points on 3-of-8 attempts off the bench, two rebounds, two assists, one steal, and one block for the Mavs.\n\nMavericks rookie Cooper Flagg impressed Warriors All-Star Stephen Curry with his game-high 27-point performance in Thursday’s Christmas Day matchup. Flagg, who has participated in Curry’s basketball camp before entering the NBA, went 13-of-21 from the floor and finished with six rebounds, five assists, and one block in his first matchup against Steph and the Warriors.\n\nAfter the game, in his walk-off interview, Curry discussed what he sees in Flagg’s future, per NBA on ESPN’s X (formerly Twitter).\n\n“Just a true hooper. Competitor. You forget how young he is — just his presence out there on the court,” Curry said. “So, the future is bright. I’m glad he got this experience in his first year to understand what the bright lights feel like. The league is in good hands.”\n\n\"Just a true hooper.

We've got to start taking care of the ball. We're doing some really good stuff.\"\n\nOne issue for the Warriors this season has been turnovers. Golden State commits 15.6 turnovers per game, which ranks 29th in the NBA. Dunleavy said the Warriors will be fine if they can protect the basketball.\n\n\"Right now there's a little too much talk about fixing the roster and some of these other things going on.

We've got to take care of the ball, and we'll be good.\"\n\nMORE: Ben Simmons is going pro in a sport you'd never expect\n\nGolden State has had several role players emerge this season.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe future status of Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga remains one of the most fascinating in the NBA, and trade talks involving him are growing louder.\n\nBleacher Report's Eric Pincus proposed an eight-team deal that would send Kuminga elsewhere and reunite Klay Thompson with the Warriors. The full trade involves the Warriors, Jazz, Mavericks, Magic, Nets, Nuggets, Raptors and Suns.\n\nGolden State would receive Thompson, Jonathan Isaac, Day'Ron Sharpe, Garrett Temple and a Jazz 2027 first-round pick. Kuminga would head to Utah, along with Hunter Tyson (Nuggets) and Nigel Hayes-Davis (Suns). Buddy Hield, Al Horford and Trayce Jackson-Davis would also be moved from the Warriors in the deal.\n\n\"The Warriors satisfy Curry's wishes, getting Thompson to replace Hield, who has struggled to hit shots this season,\" Pincus said. \"The trio (with Draymond Green) would be on the path to close their historic runs together through the 2026-27 season, provided Green opts into the final year of his contract.\"\n\nMORE: Ben Simmons is going pro in a sport you'd never expect\n\nThompson would return to Golden State, where he spent 13 seasons before being traded to Dallas in the 2024 offseason.

    "fullText": "Things seemed set up for the Golden State Warriors to make another run at a championship during the 2025-26 season. Unfortunately, the high potential they showed after trading for Jimmy Butler earlier this year has completely disappeared, and they enter Christmas Day with a 15-15 record.\n\nMaking matters worse was a Monday argument between Steve Kerr and Draymond Green that ended with the forward leaving the bench and being MIA for much of the third quarter. It was just the latest incident with the team great. While Kerr apologized for the verbal dustup, it may just be the latest sign the organization must move on from the 35-year-old.\n\nIf they did take the bold step of trading Draymond Green before February’s deadline, here are five teams that might target a trade, including the Detroit Pistons.\n\nWhen he was a free agent a few years ago, there were rumblings that Green’s home state team, the Pistons, had interest. In the end, he stayed with Golden State. But now may be the perfect time for him to return home. Detroit owns the best record in the East, and the very young team could use more veteran leadership with rings on its resume.\n\nGreen would certainly be motivated by returning home to a contending team and could be a huge X-factor for Detroit in the second half of the season.\n\nAfter playing well in November, the Miami Heat have struggled mightily in December. Surprisingly, their defense has been the big problem, and they are a bottom-10 team in points against. If they are allowed to move Terry Rozier’s contract while suspended, why not make a trade for Green?\n\nHe would certainly help improve them on defense and be a nice addition to a team that already has Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, and Norman Powell.\n\nThe Houston Rockets are a serious title contender. The loss of Fred VanVleet for the season led to an interesting pivot to going big with their lineup and ball handlers. Certain impact guards may be out of their price range on the trade market, but Green is another big ball handler who could come at a more affordable rate.\n\nPlus, he fits in nicely with their defensive style and is another big moment veteran for a group that aspires to win it all this spring.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns have been one of the nice surprises in the NBA this season. What makes their rise back to relevancy even more interesting is that it has been led by a far better defense than anyone expected. Owner Matt Ishbia is willing to make bold moves, especially when he has a soft spot for a player. Could the Michigan State alum trade for a fellow Spartan before the trade deadline? It should not be ruled out.\n\nPlus, Green and Dillon Brooks on the same team would be must-see TV when it comes to in-game psychology.\n\nThe Warriors have been linked to Dallas Mavericks star Anthony Davis in recent trade rumors. Could a swap for Draymond Green be a possibility?\n\nDallas would certainly be open to it because they would regain a lot of cap flexibility in the deal. Golden State would also welcome the chance to get an elite-level big — when healthy — for the stretch run. Furthermore, Green being reunited with Klay Thompson could be an added motivation for the Golden State legend.\n\nTennessee Titans Doing Research on Top College Football Coach\n\nCavaliers Make Monster Trade For Giannis, and 4 Other Bold Ideas to Save the Season\n\nDallas Cowboys Could Cut Two Pricey Pro Bowl Defenders",

    "description": "The Golden State Warriors veteran forward has offered to come off the bench if it helps the team",
    "fullText": "The Golden State Warriors are still searching for the right combination of talent, both in the starting lineup and off the bench. Steve Kerr's job has been made harder by the team's brutal schedule to start the season and the string f injuries throughout the roster. As such, we're yet to see what the Warriors can do when they're working with a sustained period of health.\n\nNevertheless, Kerr and his veteran leaders are undoubtedly looking for ways to help give the team a boost. According to Kerr, speaking at a post-practice news conference, Draymond Green has offered to come off the bench if the coaching staff believes it will give the team the balance it needs. Kerr, however, is not currently looking to make that change.\n\n“He told me, this year, ‘I'll go to the bench if you need me to.’ I know what Draymond is about,\" Kerr said. \"He's about winning...That's not even a consideration for me right now,” he said, “Because I'm really excited about this starting lineup: Steph, Draymond, Moses (Moody), (Quinten Post), Jimmy, I think it's a great starting lineup for us, because we get the size and shooting of Quentin next to Dray, which takes the pressure off of him. And Dre is at his best next to Steph. He should play most of his minutes with Steph. Those two guys are incredible together.\"\n\nGreen has struggled on offense this season. He's got more personal fouls than he does made field goals. However, he's still an integral part of the starting lineup and is operating as the team's primary playmaker. Furthermore, his defensive IQ and ability to quarterback a defense provide an important leadership dynamic that helps set a tone to begin the game.\n\nNevertheless, if the Warriors continue to struggle building momentum, Kerr may look to experiment with different roster combinations in the future, and there is always the potential for Green to move into a second unit role later in the year.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Steve Kerr reveals selfless offer from Draymond Green",

    "fullText": "Steve Kerr admits the Warriors are a 'fading dynasty' amidst all the team's struggles originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are one of the most successful teams of the 21st century. They have four championships with Steve Kerr as the head coach and Stephen Curry as the superstar. Of course, they also had Draymond Green and Klay Thompson across all championships, which made them a modern NBA dynasty.\n\nUnfortunately, the Warriors' core has aged, as they are in their mid-to-late 30s now. Kerr admits that the Warriors are not at their best anymore, which is an inevitability, considering Father Time is undefeated.\n\nIn today's NBA, the Warriors are one of the teams that are stuck in limbo. They want to be successful, as seen with the quality of players they have on the roster. Unfortunately, their core might be too old to compete against the younger teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nKerr wants his team to remain competitive, but it might not happen anymore because the Warriors' time has passed. They were once a dynasty that almost every other NBA team feared, but now, they are not seen as a title contender anymore.\n\nMore: Cam Johnson and Trey Murphy believe Steph Curry is the most unique player ever\n\nThis is a new look at the Warriors because many have seen them as a perennial contender for almost a decade. Today, they are eighth in the Western Conference standings with a 15-15 record. This is not what people are used to seeing, which is why Kerr is a bit tentative with his current roster.\n\n\"I feel really good about where our team is on the floor, where we're heading, I see the potential in doing exactly what we did last year, to really go on a run, and give ourselves a chance... Most importantly for me, is that there is beauty in the struggle. We are no longer the '17 Warriors dominating the league, we are a fading dynasty, we know that,\" Kerr said about his team and their chances this season.\n\nHe wants his team to play well, as he believes in his players. However, that might not be enough because the Warriors are not the same team they once were during their dynasty era with Curry, Green, Thompson, and Kevin Durant.\n\nMoving forward, the Warriors will work hard to become a top team again, but it is looking unlikely, considering the core's age and how well the rest of the NBA has improved at beating the Warriors.\n\nJalen Williams believes more reps will help solve the Thunder's back-to-back issues\n\nThis Draymond Green stat is atrocious for Warriors legend\n\nNew Stephen Curry video has Warriors fans convinced he has the worst whistle in the NBA\n\nJames Harden blasted as 'foul baiter' by opposing head coach\n\nKevin Durant reacts to being benched for 4th quarter of Rockets loss",

    "fullText": "An especially introspective Steve Kerr told reporters Wednesday that there's beauty in the struggle while he reflected on the state of his Golden State Warriors and the blowup he had with Draymond Green during the third quarter of a 120-97 win over the Orlando Magic two days earlier.\n\nKerr and Green were seen in a heated discussion during a timeout Monday night. After an animated exchange, Green decided to remove himself and left for the Chase Center locker rooms.\n\nAlthough he eventually returned to the bench, he didn't check back into the game.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nKerr said he and his do-it-all forward had a \"great chat\" Wednesday. The longtime Warriors head coach said he and Green apologized to each other as well as to the team.\n\nKerr explained that it was not his finest hour, nor was it a good look for his group.\n\n\"That was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange,\" Kerr said Wednesday.\n\n\"These things, they happen, especially when you get two incredibly competitive people like Dray and me. So over the 12 years we've been together, this has happened occasionally, and I'm not proud of it.\"\n\nKerr added: \"I care so much about Draymond, and the relationship we have is like family. And like family, you go through ups and downs. And my No. 1 goal honestly is for him to finish his career as a Warrior with us fighting — metaphorically, not literally — and competing together until we're both gone. And I believe that's going to happen because I believe in Draymond, and I believe in myself and I believe in everything we've built for 12 years.\"\n\nFull soundbite of Steve Kerr on the heated exchange with Draymond Green:\n\n“I regret my actions in that exchange and I apologized to Dray, he apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\nKerr reflected on their 12 years of winning together, expressing his belief in Green. pic.twitter.com/xpWhHFwZoA\n\n— Kenzo Fukuda (@kenzofuku) December 24, 2025\n\nThe Warriors famously selected Green out of Michigan State with the 35th overall pick in the second round of the 2012 draft. Kerr has coached him from the 2014-15 season on. Since, Green has emerged as a four-time All-Star, one-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. Together, Kerr and Green have won four NBA championships.\n\nWhile Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and then Kevin Durant, consistently shot the lights out, Green has left his own mark on the organization: with defensive tenacity, heady court vision and physical rebounding, plus timely scoring.\n\n\"We have four banners out there, and obviously a lot of people have played important roles in that, but I've said this before, and I truly believe it. I don't think we have any without Draymond. That's how much he impacts winning.\n\n\"So his ability to channel that passion, that emotion, that raw rage that he has is a key component to what makes us successful. And what I said about the other night, I didn't channel my own raw emotion and rage, of which there is plenty. We are far more alike than anyone would ever realize.\"\n\nKerr cited a long history of turning negative moments into positive momentum during his relationship with Green, who Kerr described as \"very complex.\" While Green has racked up technical fouls and served his fair share of suspensions for outbursts during a 14-season NBA career, he's also known for his basketball acumen and his contemplative commentary.\n\n\"We've always, always found a way to not only bounce back, but to make strides as a result,\" Kerr said, via Warriors reporter Kenzo Fukuda.\n\nWith the win over the Magic, the Warriors improved to 15-15. They've won back-to-back games for the fifth time this season. But they've still yet to string together more than three victories in a row.\n\nThis version of Golden State is spearheaded by Curry, Green and Jimmy Butler III. They're all at least 35 years old. Butler is a Warriors transplant who helped spark a second-half run last season, which ended in the Western Conference semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in the first game of the series.\n\n\"Where we are as a team, as an organization, the most important thing for me is for guys to recognize that there's beauty in the struggle. There's beauty in what we're trying to accomplish right now,\" Kerr said Wednesday, via The San Francisco Standard's Danny Emerman.\n\n\"We are no longer the '17 Warriors, dominating the league. We are a fading dynasty. We know that. Everyone knows that. So what is up to us? How do we carry ourselves night to night? How connected are we? And can we give ourselves another swing at the plate? We did that last year. I was really proud of the team last year. Despite the loss to Minnesota, injury to Steph. Who knows how long we would've gone? But we gave ourselves a chance. That's the goal here.\n\n\"We know where we are. We've got to know who we are, we've got to know what's possible, and we've got to take pride in the struggle, because this is part of life.\"\n\nKerr said he believes sorting out the tiff with Green has been a major step in this Warriors team working through its issues.\n\nHe sees an opportunity for Golden State to make another run like last year's.\n\nAs for Green, Kerr wants him to finish his career in a Warriors uniform.\n\n\"He's undyingly loyal and passionate, and I will go to bat for him as long as I'm coaching him here,\" Kerr said, per Emerman. \"Honestly, I'd go to bat for him 20 years from now when we haven't been together. That's how strongly I feel about him. And that's how I want this thing to end with us, whenever that is.\"",

I apologized to Dray. He apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.\"\n\nSteve Kerr on Draymond Green: “Monday night was not my finest hour and that was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange. I apologized to Dray. He apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\n— Joseph Dycus (@joseph_dycus) December 24, 2025\n\nGreen, a four-time champion in 13 seasons with the Warriors, said after Monday's game to reporters that \"tempers spilled over\".\n\n\"I just thought it was best that I get out of there,\" Green said. \"I don't think it was a situation where it was going to get better, so it was best to remove myself.\"\n\nThe cause of the argument Green said was basketball.\n\n\"It's what we do,\" he said. \"We play basketball. It's an emotional game. People lose their emotions sometimes, it happens. It is what it is. We've been at this now for a long time. Sometimes you're with people for a long time there's a level of comfort and it happens. We move forward.\"\n\nReporters on Monday asked if it was something that would linger on, but Green dismissed it saying they would \"move forward\".\n\n\"We'll move forward, we're alright,\" Green said regarding his spat with Kerr.\n\nThe Warriors are currently have a .500 record after 30 games, sitting at the eighth spot in the Western Conference. They have a Christmas Day game Thursday against the Dallas Mavericks and their rookie sensation Cooper Flagg at Chase Center in San Francisco.\n\n\"I think we're headed in the right direction,\" Green said to reporters Monday. \"No one's happy about being 15-15.

    "fullText": "Draymond Green left Monday night’s win over the Orlando Magic early after he got into an argument with head coach Steve Kerr.\n\nGreen and Kerr were seen in a heated discussion during a timeout in the third quarter of the Warriors’ 120-97 win over the Magic, though it wasn’t clear what that argument was about. It was, though, extremely animated on the bench. At one point, it looked like Moses Moody tried to step in and calm Green down, but he later gave up and sat back down.\n\nEventually, Green walked off the floor and went back to the locker rooms at the Chase Center.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nThat, Kerr said after the game, was actually Green’s decision. He wasn’t sent there, though Kerr declined to reveal what their tiff was actually about.\n\n“We got into it, obviously … We had it out a little bit, and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off,” Kerr said, via ESPN’s Anthony Slater. “That’s all I’m gonna say about it, everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”\n\nSteve Kerr said Draymond Green chose to go to the locker room after the two had a heated argument during an early third quarter timeout. He wasn’t sent there. Green returned to bench for fourth quarter but Kerr said he wouldn’t have gone back to Green.\n\nFull soundbite pic.twitter.com/SPZvuqteIB\n\n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) December 23, 2025\n\nGreen did return to the Warriors’ bench before the end of the game, but he did not take the floor again. He wasn't going to, Kerr said.\n\n“Well, he left,” Kerr said plainly. “He went back to the locker room.”\n\nGreen finished with nine points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes on Monday night. He’s averaged eight points and six rebounds per game this season, his 14th in the league.\n\nStephen Curry led the Warriors with 26 points in the win, which pushed the team to 15-15 on the season. Jimmy Butler added 21 points, and Moses Moody finished with 20 points. Paolo Banchero led the Magic with 21 points and 12 rebounds in the loss, and Desmond Bane added 20 points. They shot just 7-of-27 from the 3-point line as a group, and now sit at 16-13 on the season.\n\nThough Green has been known to get into some heated altercations throughout his career, he’s appeared to have had a great relationship with Kerr. The Warriors selected Green in the second round of the 2012 NBA Draft, and he’s spent his entire career with the franchise. Kerr took over as the team’s head coach ahead of the 2014-15 campaign, and Green has been a key part of the four championships they’ve won at Golden State.\n\nClearly, Green and Kerr aren't on the same page right now. While Green hasn't spoken on the incident yet, Kerr is, at least publicly, trying to move forward.\n\n“We need Draymond. He’s a champion,” Kerr said. “We’ve been together for a long time … It’s unfortunate what happened, but it happened.”",

    "fullText": "Steve Kerr hits back at the referees for \"weak\" Draymond Green ejection originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors got a much-needed win by beating the Phoenix Suns 119-116. It would have been a disastrous loss for Golden State, as it would have been their fourth consecutive defeat. Thankfully for the Warriors, Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler combined for 53 points.\n\nDraymond Green only got to play eight minutes, as he was ejected from the game with two technical fouls. It was a surprising call because most people did not expect that to happen, but the Warriors had to play almost the whole game without their best defender.\n\nWarriors head coach Steve Kerr admits that at least one technical foul was warranted because Green was talking to the referees. However, Kerr disliked that the second technical was quickly called on Green, which led to the ejection.\n\nKerr was livid about the call, which led to him also getting a technical foul. It was a bad stretch for the Warriors because they lost a top defender and playmaker. However, it appeared that the Warriors were fueled by Green's ejection.\n\nMore: Ranking 3 Key Golden State Warriors Trade Targets\n\n\"I thought it was weak. He was yelling at the refs, so he definitely deserved one. But then, he was walking to the bench, and he yelled something, and the second technical. We saw one guy on their team literally punch Steph in the stomach the other night. Pre-meditated, punches him in the stomach, no ejection for that,\" Kerr said after the game.\n\nDillon Brooks was the player that Kerr was talking about, which was why he was livid. Kerr wanted to call it out because it was not the best moment for the referees, given the context a couple of days prior.\n\nThe Warriors needed a win after their struggles in the past few weeks. They lost to the same Suns team on Thursday, so they wanted to get revenge for that. However, it was a tough matchup for the Warriors, especially when Green got ejected.\n\nThankfully for the Warriors, Curry and Butler stepped up in his place. Curry himself credited the ejection as some sort of a wake-up call for the Warriors, as they needed that to get the win.\n\nMore: Warriors' Steph Curry makes basketball history never done in NBA for his position\n\n\"Yeah, it's tough. We were energized at the beginning of the game, knowing that it was a good opportunity to bounce back. There was a weird, choppy, physical game in the first quarter. It spilled into the second, I think it woke us up because we knew without him, we had to play tougher,\" Curry said after the game about the ejection.\n\nNow, the Warriors are 14-15 on the season, clinging to the eighth seed in the Western Conference. It will be a tough stretch moving forward, but the Warriors are ready to improve in their quest to make the postseason.",

    "fullText": "Ranking 3 Key Golden State Warriors Trade Targets originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are expected to get active in the NBA trade market once again.\n\nAfter making a handful of notable trades during the 2024-2025 season, the Warriors are keeping an eye on several targets just months before the deadline. According to the NBA insider Chris Haynes, the Warriors have three names on their radar as they look to boost the front court.\n\n\"They are looking for size and athleticism. You look at the Warriors, rebounding and blocking shots, they're in the bottom half of the league. And points in the paint, they are dead last. So they are looking for an athletic center,\" Haynes said on NBA on Prime on Friday night.\n\nWhat the Bucks and Warriors are looking for on the trade market for @NBAonPrime. pic.twitter.com/Pl2CcXo5AV\n\n— Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) December 20, 2025\n\nDallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford was the first name to come up, and he just might be at the top of the list. The 27-year-old big man is a former second-round pick out of Arkansas.\n\nGafford is playing for his third team since entering the NBA in 2019, having previous stints with the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards. Last season, he appeared in 57 games for the Mavs, averaging 12.3 points and 6.8 rebounds. This year, he’s producing 8.5 points per game, while coming down with 6.1 rebounds and blocking 1.5 shots in 17 games.\n\nThe Mavericks are currently paying $14.3 million to Gafford. He has a $54 million extension kicking in next season.\n\nWhile he only has two playoff runs on his resume, Gafford had a meaningful postseason run in 2024 with 22 appearances, maintaining his regular-season averages.\n\nNic Claxton of the Brooklyn Nets is another reported target for Golden State. Although the Nets invested nearly $100 million in Claxton last year, they remain in a rebuilding mode. Sitting 13th in the Eastern Conference with a 7-19 record, the Nets are expected to operate as sellers ahead of the deadline.\n\nSince 2019, Claxton has been a part of three playoff runs in Brooklyn. Between 2022 and 2023, the Nets faced two first-round sweeps, limiting Claxton's chances of improving his postseason value. Despite the lack of experience, Claxton is a logical candidate.\n\nLastly, the Portland Trail Blazers center, Robert Williams, is gaining attention from the Warriors’ front office, according to Haynes. The 28-year-old former first-round pick is in year three with the Portland Trail Blazers after spending several seasons with the Boston Celtics.\n\nWilliams was a defensive standout with the Celtics before leaving for Portland in 2023. Since his exit from the Celtics, Williams has struggled to stay healthy. He underwent multiple knee surgeries over the past couple of years, limiting his production with the Blazers.\n\nThis season, Williams has appeared in 17 games for the Blazers. With an average of 15 minutes of playing time off the bench, he has produced averages of 5.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks this year.\n\nThe idea of Williams on the Warriors might seem great, but his injury history is certainly a concern.\n\nWhile Williams, Gafford, and Claxton are three names to keep an eye on in December, several other options could pop up for the Warriors as the season plays out. It’s unclear who the Warriors will end up with, but the 13-15 squad from Golden State is expected to make some important roster changes before the market closes.",

But, the good news for the team is that superstar guard Steph Curry will be available, as he’s not listed on the official injury report for the game against Phoenix.\n\nCurry appears to have recovered completely from the quad injury that cost him five games earlier this month. The showdown with the Suns on Saturday will be the fourth consecutive game played in by Curry after that string of absences.\n\nUnfortunately, Curry’s return to action hasn’t correlated to winning for Golden State as the Warriors have dropped all three games since his return. But, there’s no question that him being available gives the Warriors their best chance at winning.\n\nOn the season, Curry is averaging 28.8 points, 4.1 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals per performance.",

Adam Hastings looked for Jamie Dobie with a cross-field kick and he was crudely taken out in the air by Ben Vellacott.\n\nThe penalty was kicked to the corner, the Glasgow pack rumbled over and Hiddleston touched down to put Glasgow two scores clear.\n\nEdinburgh finally showed signs of life in attack and engineered a golden opportunity for Darcy Graham out wide, but Ollie Smith, outstanding all day, covered superbly to bundle the little winger into touch.\n\nThe capital side did make things more interesting when Gilchrist barrelled over – though replays suggested he may have been short of the line when he grounded the ball - to bring his side back within seven.\n\nAny hint of a late comeback was extinguished when substitute Stephen finished off a rolling line-out maul to seal the bonus-point win and secure a handy aggregate cushion to take into next week's second leg at Murrayfield.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: Smith, Steyn (c), McDowall, Tuipulotu, Dobie; Hastings, Horne; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Afshar, Lancaster.\n\nEdinburgh: Goosen, Graham, O'Conor, Currie, Van der Merwe; Scott, Vellacott; Schoeman, Ashman, O Blyth-Lafferty, Young, Gilchrist, McConnell, Richardson, Bradbury.\n\nReplacements: Harris, Venter, Hill, Hunter-Hill, Douglas, McAlpine, Thompson, Davidson.",

    "fullText": "Warriors reportedly making calls about Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo, despite unlikelihood of trade right now originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks haven’t played the type of basketball they were hoping for throughout the season, but a lot of that can be due to the fact that Giannis Antetokounmpo simply hasn’t been on the court much.\n\nAntetokounmpo has seemingly made it known that he isn’t exactly happy with everything going on in Milwaukee, but from his perspective, it’s also a bit unfair.\n\nRegardless, it doesn’t sound like the Bucks want to move on from him, and although anything is possible in this league, it doesn’t seem like anything is imminent on that front.\n\nDespite that reality, Michael Scotto of HoopsHype had the latest on the Golden State Warriors’ pursuit of the superstar, adding that despite the unlikelihood of him being traded, the Warriors and other teams around the league are still calling.\n\n“In fact, rival executives interested in trading for Antetokounmpo who’ve spoken with HoopsHype said they don’t believe Milwaukee wants to move him right now. With that said, it’s unlikely to keep teams such as the New York Knicks, Miami Heat, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Houston Rockets, and others from continuing to monitor Antetokounmpo’s situation to varying degrees, looking ahead,” he wrote.\n\nIt’s tough to find the perfect package from the Warriors’ perspective.\n\nNot many teams around the league want Jonathan Kuminga, so unless Golden State is willing to part ways with other key pieces, there will likely be stronger offers available for the Bucks.\n\nWarriors' Steph Curry made a crazy discovery during his legendary pregame warmup\n\nWarriors get major Klay Thompson trade update involving Stephen Curry\n\nIs Steph Curry playing tonight vs. Suns?

    "description": "If Edinburgh turn over high-flying Glasgow Warriors at Hampden on Saturday, it would be a shock on the scale of St Mirren's cup final win against Celtic.",
    "fullText": "URC: Glasgow Warriors v Edinburgh\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Saturday, 20 December Time: 15:00 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live text on BBC Sport website & app\n\nIt's less than a week since Hampden Park witnessed its last shock when St Mirren beat Celtic in the Premier Sports Cup final. If Edinburgh turn over high-flying Glasgow Warriors at the national stadium on Saturday, it would be similarly surprising.\n\nWarriors are riding high after a thrilling and stunning victory over six-time European champions Toulouse in the Champions Cup, rising from the ashes of a 21-0 deficit to deliver a win that sent reverberations around Europe.\n\nEdinburgh, by contrast, are reeling from a 33-0 thrashing at the hands of Castres. A seismic win at home to French heavyweights Toulon the week before confirmed what we already know: that at their best Edinburgh can be a match for anyone. But they remain consistently, and maddeningly, inconsistent.\n\nThe tale of recent 1872 Cup meetings has been victory for the home side. Since adopting a two-leg format in 2021, seven of the past eight matches between Glasgow and Edinburgh have resulted in home victories. Edinburgh have not delivered an 1872 Cup victory along the M8 since 2020.\n\nWarriors have won the trophy in the past three consecutive seasons, but in the most recent two they have had the bittersweet feeling of lifting the trophy having been turned over in the second leg at Murrayfield.\n\n\"It's been difficult for us over the last couple of years because we've gone through this cycle of hammering Edinburgh in the first game, we're all over them, and then the second game we lose,\" Warriors' Ollie Smith told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"We still retain the 1872 Cup, but I think it just shows the kind of standards that we set ourselves at the start of the season to be like, we're not just happy to retain the 1872 Cup, we want to win both games.\n\n\"It's getting our emotions right in those massive occasions and putting a performance that we know we can be proud of.\n\n\"If they beat us then they have to beat us by being perfect because, and there's no disrespect to Edinburgh, but it feels like we've almost let them win because we've not been at it. But this year, the focus is for us to be spot on and make them beat us rather than giving it to them.\"\n\nCummings eyes silverware as he signs new Glasgow deal\n\nHow loss of brother shaped Smith's rugby journey\n\nEdinburgh's memories of their first visit to Hampden last season are ones they would rather forget. They were obliterated by Glasgow, falling 33-0 down before grabbing a couple of late consolation tries to take a slight edge off the embarrassing scoreline.\n\nSean Everitt's side are specialists at bouncing back from bad defeats, mainly because they have had so much practice at it. Edinburgh fans would love if, for once, their team were not made to suffer before producing a reaction, but rather came out at Hampden on the front foot.\n\nOne of the capital side's breakout stars this season, back-row Liam McConnell, believes that in Glasgow his team face not only their local rivals, but one of the best sides around. It is among the reasons he is relishing the tussle between the sides.\n\n\"I've never played in one,\" said the 21-year-old. \"I've been at the club for the last couple of seasons now and been around it when it's the 1872 Cup weeks. It's always special.\n\n\"The guys in the matchday squad have a different intensity around them, so to be part of it is pretty cool. Everyone's real focused for Saturday, you can tell.\n\n\"It'll be good. Glasgow are in good form right now, probably one of the best club teams in the world, you could say.\n\n\"It's not only 1872, we're playing one of the best club teams in the world at the moment, so that's a challenge in itself. I'm really excited.\"\n\nAll the feelgood factor and momentum generated from that famous win over Toulon was dynamited by Edinburgh fielding a weakened team and going down meekly to Castres.\n\nIt's a familiar narrative heading into the derby – Glasgow being showered with praise, Edinburgh being bombarded with questions and criticism.\n\nThe best way to change that would be to give Warriors a bloody nose in front of their own people on Saturday.\n\n\"There's no-one better to beat, is there?\" said Edinburgh hooker Ewan Ashman.\n\n\"We know they're a quality team and those are the games you want to play. Glasgow are a good side and that was a good win [against Toulouse].\n\n\"We've done similar a couple of weeks ago against Toulon, so we know the feeling. They'll be riding super high and they'll be coming in with confidence.\n\n\"It's the exact kind of challenge we're looking to take head-on. We need to show that fighting spirit.\"",

    "fullText": "Heading into Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors were riding a two-game losing streak. In each game, the Warriors held a lead in the fourth quarter, but struggled down the stretch on the way to losses.\n\nOn Thursday against the Phoenix Suns, the Warriors failed to close again, despite a heroic performance from Jimmy Butler. Behind Butler, the Warriors built a seven-point lead at halftime, yet heading into the fourth quarter, their lead dwindled down to one.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Suns took control as momentum swung their way. Yet, Butler, Steph Curry and the Warriors wouldn't go away. In the final minute, the Suns led by five points before Dillon Brooks committed a flagrant foul on Curry, sending him to the line for a pair of free throws. After the free throws from Curry, Butler knocked down a clutch 3-pointer to tie the game at 96. After Booker and Curry traded buckets to tie the game again at 98, Moses Moody committed a late foul on Jordan Goodwin in the final second of the game. Goodwin missed the first attempt from the line before hitting the game-winning free throw and dealt the Warriors their third straight loss, 99-98.\n\nButler finished with a game-high 31 points on 11-of-17 shooting from the field with three assists and three rebounds in 34 minutes. Butler's performance on Thursday night in Phoenix was his third game of the season scoring 30 or more points. Thursday also marked his highest scoring mark in a month.\n\nAlongside Butler, Brandin Podziemski put together a strong performance on Thursday, scoring 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting from the field with a pair of made 3-pointers in 28 minutes off the bench.\n\nWhile Podziemski and Butler helped fuel Golden State's offense, Steph Curry struggled, scoring 15 points on 3-of-13 shooting from the field and 2-of-9 from deep. Butler, Podziemski and Curry were the only members of the Warriors to tally double-figure scoring numbers. Draymond Green committed five of Golden State's 20 turnovers.\n\nAfter their third straight loss, the Warriors have fallen to 13-15 on the season. The Warriors will get the chance to avenge their loss from Thursday when the Suns travel back to the Bay Area on Saturday for a rematch at Chase Center.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Late free throws from Suns helps deal Warriors' third straight loss",

ESPN's Nick Friedell reports that Horford is still around another week away from returning from to the court as he continues to rehab from his sciatica injury.\n\nHorford said he is feeling better in his rehab — but he thinks he’s probably another week away from returning as he continues to deal with a sciatica issue.\n\n— Nick Friedell (@NickFriedell) December 18, 2025\n\nHorford has played 13 games in his first season for the Warriors, averaging 5.6 points on 32.1% shooting from the field and 29.8% from deep to go along with 4.4 rebounds per contest.\n\nWhile Horford is out on Thursday with his sciatica injury, Spencer is ruled out against the Suns for personal reasons. With Spencer and Horford out, Steve Kerr will have to lean on Golden State's depth, with players like Quinten Post, Brandin Podziemski, De'Anthony Melton and Gary Payton II potentially seeing a bigger role on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nThe Warriors will tip off against the Suns at 6 p.m. PT on Thursday night in the desert.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Injury Report: Al Horford, Pat Spencer out vs. Suns",

    "description": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea from Steve Kerr about gun control.",
    "fullText": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea for gun control from Steve Kerr.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors coach spoke for about three minutes unprompted on Sunday night before their 136-131 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers and again called for gun reform in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University.\n\n“With what happened last night at Brown, it’s just a reminder to me that these shootings continue to happen, and there is something we can do about them. The loss that all of the people involved [Saturday] night, the loss that they’re feeling, it’s exactly the same loss as all the Parkland families, and every other mass shooting.\n\n“Nobody asked me about it today. I didn’t expect anybody to ask me. I doubt we’re gonna do a moment of silence out there because it’s human nature just to not want to deal with this stuff. And it’s human nature just to think, ‘This is so horrible. Let’s not even think about it.’ But we have to think about it.”\n\nSpeaking pregame, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr addresses gun violence following this weekend’s shooting at Brown University.\n\n“We know there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. … I just want people thinking ‘What if it were my child?’”\n\nMore: pic.twitter.com/E2n9z62jYZ\n\n— Sam Gordon (@BySamGordon) December 15, 2025\n\nA shooting took place at Brown University in Rhode Island on Saturday afternoon that left two people dead and nine others injured, according to The New York Times. An investigation is still ongoing. Authorities released a man who they had detained on Sunday night, and are still searching for the alleged gunman.\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, that was the 389th mass shootings in the United States so far this year. There have been others since.\n\nGun control is something that Kerr has been a strong advocate of for years. He’s spoken out about plenty of other mass shootings in the United States in the past, hosted a town hall about the issue, drawn support for groups founded by students who survived other mass shootings, and more. Kerr’s father, Malcolm, was shot and killed during a terrorist attack in Beirut in 1984 when Steve was a student at Arizona.\n\n“The vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Kerr said. “They have every right to own a gun. But it’s on us to decide if we actually want to take action as a country, as citizens. We know, we know that there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. And I just want people out there — it doesn’t matter if you’re Democrat or Republican, or gun owner, non-gun owner — I just want people thinking, ‘What if it were my child? What if it were my brother or sister?’ Would you be willing to stand up to your representatives and say, ‘You know what? Enough. I’m not gonna vote for you unless you are going to stand up for gun violence prevention through common-sense laws that the vast majority of Americans agree on.'\n\n“Or are we just gonna continue to let the gun lobby run us over and not do anything to protect each other, to protect our children, to protect our future. We have to make that decision.”\n\nKerr wasn't alone in the sports world, either. USC women's basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb, who played at Brown, spoke out on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's the guns,\" she said after the Trojans' loss to No. 1 UConn. \"We're the only country that lives this way.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time that Kerr has addressed this issue, and mass shootings continue to occur in the United States. Based on recent history, it likely won't be the last time we hear from Kerr about gun control, either.\n\nWhile Kerr knows how easy it would be to just give up and ignore the problem, especially since it seems like nothing is getting better, he ended his plea on Sunday night with a simple solution.\n\n“Don’t just look the other way, even though that’s human nature and I understand it,” Kerr said. “Think about it. Think about, do you want something done? Do you want your child to go to school terrified every day? Or do you want to actually take action?\n\n“Because that’s what a democracy is about. Where we demand that our representatives protect us. And that option is there. So, we can either just do what we’re continuing to do and let these things happen or make some demands. And so, as you’re thinking about this today, think about, what if it were your own family member?”",

Simply put, the electric 6-foot-2 point guard’s history-making ways won’t stop here.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors' Stephen Curry broke another all-time Michael Jordan record",

Glasgow needed something to offer a glimmer of hope and they got it when some slick handling set McKay free up the touchline to run in for the try.\n\nWhether it was some strong words at half-time from head coach Franco Smith, or turning around to play with the wind now at their backs, a flick had switched and suddenly Warriors were putting it up to their illustrious opponents.\n\nThe Glasgow bench was making an impact and one of the substitutes, Brown, blasted over from close range to reduce the arrears to seven points and bring Scotstoun to life.\n\nThe roof nearly came off the place when Tuipulotu finished off an a period of intense pressure on the Toulouse line, and when Adam Hastings banged over the conversion we were all square.\n\nStill Glasgow came. They had Toulouse rocking and they landed another blow, a rolling line-out maul thundering over the try-line with substitute Hiddleston touching down to give Warriors the lead for the first time.\n\nThe great teams often find their way out a hole, but on this particular night, the Toulouse Galacticos had the fight knocked out of them by an inspired Glasgow Warriors side on a beautifully bonkers evening at Scotstoun that will live long in the memory.\n\nGlasgow: McKay; Steyn, McDowall, Tuipulotu, Smith; Hastings, Dobie; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, M Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Horne, Lancaster.\n\nToulouse: Ramos; Capuozzo, Costes, Gourgues, Kinghorn; Ntamack, Dupont; Ainuu, Marchand, Aldegheri, Brennan, Flament, Willis, Banos, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Lacombre, Neti, Merkler, Meafou, Castro Ferreira, Roumat, Graou, Thomas.",
