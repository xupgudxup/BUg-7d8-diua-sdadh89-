Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEven after consecutive wins -- including an impressive takedown of the Orlando Magic -- the Golden State Warriors are stuck in Western Conference no man's land.\n\nAt 15-15, the Warriors sit eighth in the standings, and 3.5 games back of the sixth-place Houston Rockets.\n\nGolden State has one of the oldest rosters in the NBA, and championship-winning head coach Steve Kerr has been embroiled in controversy over his management of the franchise's young players like Jonathan Kuminga. Some observers believe the Warriors need a drastic shake-up.\n\nMORE: Warriors linked to stunning Draymond Green trade with division rival\n\nThe Ringer's Bill Simmons has proposed a radical solution: the Warriors should deal franchise legend Steph Curry to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for LaMelo Ball and a package of draft picks.\n\n\"(Curry) grew up there, his dad (Dell Curry) is there, he's always joked about ending his career there,\" Simmons said on his eponymous podcast. \"I don't think this Warriors team has any chance. We just saw Draymond (Green) blow up last night.

But it does add something to the swirling debate over Golden State's long-term outlook.\n\nCurry, 37, is under contract through next year and is slated to make $62 million in 2026-27. The Warriors' championship window appears closed, with West powers Oklahoma City and San Antonio set up well for the future.\n\nThe Hornets have not made the playoffs in nine years, and a backcourt of Curry and Kon Knueppel would shoot the lights out. Ball's own long-term outlook in Charlotte is murky, and his reputation around the NBA is not exactly stellar.\n\nIt's a trade that has little chance of happening -- but for former Davidson College hero Curry, it would be a really cool homecoming.\n\nNew Stephen Curry video has Warriors fans convinced he has the worst whistle in the NBA\n\nThis Draymond Green stat is atrocious for Warriors legend\n\nMavs' Cooper Flagg reveals his Christmas list after epic night in win over Nuggets\n\nWembanyama's historic streak ends in blowout win over Thunder",

    "fullText": "Draymond Green left Monday night’s win over the Orlando Magic early after he got into an argument with head coach Steve Kerr.\n\nGreen and Kerr were seen in a heated discussion during a timeout in the third quarter of the Warriors’ 120-97 win over the Magic, though it wasn’t clear what that argument was about. It was, though, extremely animated on the bench. At one point, it looked like Moses Moody tried to step in and calm Green down, but he later gave up and sat back down.\n\nEventually, Green walked off the floor and went back to the locker rooms at the Chase Center.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nThat, Kerr said after the game, was actually Green’s decision. He wasn’t sent there, though Kerr declined to reveal what their tiff was actually about.\n\n“We got into it, obviously … We had it out a little bit, and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off,” Kerr said, via ESPN’s Anthony Slater. “That’s all I’m gonna say about it, everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”\n\nSteve Kerr said Draymond Green chose to go to the locker room after the two had a heated argument during an early third quarter timeout. He wasn’t sent there. Green returned to bench for fourth quarter but Kerr said he wouldn’t have gone back to Green.\n\nFull soundbite pic.twitter.com/SPZvuqteIB\n\n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) December 23, 2025\n\nGreen did return to the Warriors’ bench before the end of the game, but he did not take the floor again. He wasn't going to, Kerr said.\n\n“Well, he left,” Kerr said plainly. “He went back to the locker room.”\n\nGreen finished with nine points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes on Monday night. He’s averaged eight points and six rebounds per game this season, his 14th in the league.\n\nStephen Curry led the Warriors with 26 points in the win, which pushed the team to 15-15 on the season. Jimmy Butler added 21 points, and Moses Moody finished with 20 points. Paolo Banchero led the Magic with 21 points and 12 rebounds in the loss, and Desmond Bane added 20 points. They shot just 7-of-27 from the 3-point line as a group, and now sit at 16-13 on the season.\n\nThough Green has been known to get into some heated altercations throughout his career, he’s appeared to have had a great relationship with Kerr. The Warriors selected Green in the second round of the 2012 NBA Draft, and he’s spent his entire career with the franchise. Kerr took over as the team’s head coach ahead of the 2014-15 campaign, and Green has been a key part of the four championships they’ve won at Golden State.\n\nClearly, Green and Kerr aren't on the same page right now. While Green hasn't spoken on the incident yet, Kerr is, at least publicly, trying to move forward.\n\n“We need Draymond. He’s a champion,” Kerr said. “We’ve been together for a long time … It’s unfortunate what happened, but it happened.”",

    "fullText": "Steve Kerr hits back at the referees for \"weak\" Draymond Green ejection originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors got a much-needed win by beating the Phoenix Suns 119-116. It would have been a disastrous loss for Golden State, as it would have been their fourth consecutive defeat. Thankfully for the Warriors, Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler combined for 53 points.\n\nDraymond Green only got to play eight minutes, as he was ejected from the game with two technical fouls. It was a surprising call because most people did not expect that to happen, but the Warriors had to play almost the whole game without their best defender.\n\nWarriors head coach Steve Kerr admits that at least one technical foul was warranted because Green was talking to the referees. However, Kerr disliked that the second technical was quickly called on Green, which led to the ejection.\n\nKerr was livid about the call, which led to him also getting a technical foul. It was a bad stretch for the Warriors because they lost a top defender and playmaker. However, it appeared that the Warriors were fueled by Green's ejection.\n\nMore: Ranking 3 Key Golden State Warriors Trade Targets\n\n\"I thought it was weak. He was yelling at the refs, so he definitely deserved one. But then, he was walking to the bench, and he yelled something, and the second technical. We saw one guy on their team literally punch Steph in the stomach the other night. Pre-meditated, punches him in the stomach, no ejection for that,\" Kerr said after the game.\n\nDillon Brooks was the player that Kerr was talking about, which was why he was livid. Kerr wanted to call it out because it was not the best moment for the referees, given the context a couple of days prior.\n\nThe Warriors needed a win after their struggles in the past few weeks. They lost to the same Suns team on Thursday, so they wanted to get revenge for that. However, it was a tough matchup for the Warriors, especially when Green got ejected.\n\nThankfully for the Warriors, Curry and Butler stepped up in his place. Curry himself credited the ejection as some sort of a wake-up call for the Warriors, as they needed that to get the win.\n\nMore: Warriors' Steph Curry makes basketball history never done in NBA for his position\n\n\"Yeah, it's tough. We were energized at the beginning of the game, knowing that it was a good opportunity to bounce back. There was a weird, choppy, physical game in the first quarter. It spilled into the second, I think it woke us up because we knew without him, we had to play tougher,\" Curry said after the game about the ejection.\n\nNow, the Warriors are 14-15 on the season, clinging to the eighth seed in the Western Conference. It will be a tough stretch moving forward, but the Warriors are ready to improve in their quest to make the postseason.",

    "fullText": "Ranking 3 Key Golden State Warriors Trade Targets originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are expected to get active in the NBA trade market once again.\n\nAfter making a handful of notable trades during the 2024-2025 season, the Warriors are keeping an eye on several targets just months before the deadline. According to the NBA insider Chris Haynes, the Warriors have three names on their radar as they look to boost the front court.\n\n\"They are looking for size and athleticism. You look at the Warriors, rebounding and blocking shots, they're in the bottom half of the league. And points in the paint, they are dead last. So they are looking for an athletic center,\" Haynes said on NBA on Prime on Friday night.\n\nWhat the Bucks and Warriors are looking for on the trade market for @NBAonPrime. pic.twitter.com/Pl2CcXo5AV\n\n— Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) December 20, 2025\n\nDallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford was the first name to come up, and he just might be at the top of the list. The 27-year-old big man is a former second-round pick out of Arkansas.\n\nGafford is playing for his third team since entering the NBA in 2019, having previous stints with the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards. Last season, he appeared in 57 games for the Mavs, averaging 12.3 points and 6.8 rebounds. This year, he’s producing 8.5 points per game, while coming down with 6.1 rebounds and blocking 1.5 shots in 17 games.\n\nThe Mavericks are currently paying $14.3 million to Gafford. He has a $54 million extension kicking in next season.\n\nWhile he only has two playoff runs on his resume, Gafford had a meaningful postseason run in 2024 with 22 appearances, maintaining his regular-season averages.\n\nNic Claxton of the Brooklyn Nets is another reported target for Golden State. Although the Nets invested nearly $100 million in Claxton last year, they remain in a rebuilding mode. Sitting 13th in the Eastern Conference with a 7-19 record, the Nets are expected to operate as sellers ahead of the deadline.\n\nSince 2019, Claxton has been a part of three playoff runs in Brooklyn. Between 2022 and 2023, the Nets faced two first-round sweeps, limiting Claxton's chances of improving his postseason value. Despite the lack of experience, Claxton is a logical candidate.\n\nLastly, the Portland Trail Blazers center, Robert Williams, is gaining attention from the Warriors’ front office, according to Haynes. The 28-year-old former first-round pick is in year three with the Portland Trail Blazers after spending several seasons with the Boston Celtics.\n\nWilliams was a defensive standout with the Celtics before leaving for Portland in 2023. Since his exit from the Celtics, Williams has struggled to stay healthy. He underwent multiple knee surgeries over the past couple of years, limiting his production with the Blazers.\n\nThis season, Williams has appeared in 17 games for the Blazers. With an average of 15 minutes of playing time off the bench, he has produced averages of 5.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks this year.\n\nThe idea of Williams on the Warriors might seem great, but his injury history is certainly a concern.\n\nWhile Williams, Gafford, and Claxton are three names to keep an eye on in December, several other options could pop up for the Warriors as the season plays out. It’s unclear who the Warriors will end up with, but the 13-15 squad from Golden State is expected to make some important roster changes before the market closes.",

The Warriors have lost three straight games and six out of their last 10. They currently sit ninth in the Western Conference standings with an underwhelming record of 13-15 – not quite where they expected to be at this stage of the season.\n\nIn their most recent game, the Warriors lost to the Phoenix Suns by one point, 99-98. Luckily, they won’t have to wait too long for a shot at revenge, as the two teams are set to square off again on Saturday night.\n\nThe Warriors will be without a couple of key contributors for the contest as Seth Curry and Al Horford have both been ruled out due to injuries. But, the good news for the team is that superstar guard Steph Curry will be available, as he’s not listed on the official injury report for the game against Phoenix.\n\nCurry appears to have recovered completely from the quad injury that cost him five games earlier this month. The showdown with the Suns on Saturday will be the fourth consecutive game played in by Curry after that string of absences.\n\nUnfortunately, Curry’s return to action hasn’t correlated to winning for Golden State as the Warriors have dropped all three games since his return. But, there’s no question that him being available gives the Warriors their best chance at winning.\n\nOn the season, Curry is averaging 28.8 points, 4.1 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals per performance.",

Adam Hastings looked for Jamie Dobie with a cross-field kick and he was crudely taken out in the air by Ben Vellacott.\n\nThe penalty was kicked to the corner, the Glasgow pack rumbled over and Hiddleston touched down to put Glasgow two scores clear.\n\nEdinburgh finally showed signs of life in attack and engineered a golden opportunity for Darcy Graham out wide, but Ollie Smith, outstanding all day, covered superbly to bundle the little winger into touch.\n\nThe capital side did make things more interesting when Gilchrist barrelled over – though replays suggested he may have been short of the line when he grounded the ball - to bring his side back within seven.\n\nAny hint of a late comeback was extinguished when substitute Stephen finished off a rolling line-out maul to seal the bonus-point win and secure a handy aggregate cushion to take into next week's second leg at Murrayfield.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: Smith, Steyn (c), McDowall, Tuipulotu, Dobie; Hastings, Horne; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Afshar, Lancaster.\n\nEdinburgh: Goosen, Graham, O'Conor, Currie, Van der Merwe; Scott, Vellacott; Schoeman, Ashman, O Blyth-Lafferty, Young, Gilchrist, McConnell, Richardson, Bradbury.\n\nReplacements: Harris, Venter, Hill, Hunter-Hill, Douglas, McAlpine, Thompson, Davidson.",

    "description": "If Edinburgh turn over high-flying Glasgow Warriors at Hampden on Saturday, it would be a shock on the scale of St Mirren's cup final win against Celtic.",
    "fullText": "URC: Glasgow Warriors v Edinburgh\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Saturday, 20 December Time: 15:00 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live text on BBC Sport website & app\n\nIt's less than a week since Hampden Park witnessed its last shock when St Mirren beat Celtic in the Premier Sports Cup final. If Edinburgh turn over high-flying Glasgow Warriors at the national stadium on Saturday, it would be similarly surprising.\n\nWarriors are riding high after a thrilling and stunning victory over six-time European champions Toulouse in the Champions Cup, rising from the ashes of a 21-0 deficit to deliver a win that sent reverberations around Europe.\n\nEdinburgh, by contrast, are reeling from a 33-0 thrashing at the hands of Castres. A seismic win at home to French heavyweights Toulon the week before confirmed what we already know: that at their best Edinburgh can be a match for anyone. But they remain consistently, and maddeningly, inconsistent.\n\nThe tale of recent 1872 Cup meetings has been victory for the home side. Since adopting a two-leg format in 2021, seven of the past eight matches between Glasgow and Edinburgh have resulted in home victories. Edinburgh have not delivered an 1872 Cup victory along the M8 since 2020.\n\nWarriors have won the trophy in the past three consecutive seasons, but in the most recent two they have had the bittersweet feeling of lifting the trophy having been turned over in the second leg at Murrayfield.\n\n\"It's been difficult for us over the last couple of years because we've gone through this cycle of hammering Edinburgh in the first game, we're all over them, and then the second game we lose,\" Warriors' Ollie Smith told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"We still retain the 1872 Cup, but I think it just shows the kind of standards that we set ourselves at the start of the season to be like, we're not just happy to retain the 1872 Cup, we want to win both games.\n\n\"It's getting our emotions right in those massive occasions and putting a performance that we know we can be proud of.\n\n\"If they beat us then they have to beat us by being perfect because, and there's no disrespect to Edinburgh, but it feels like we've almost let them win because we've not been at it. But this year, the focus is for us to be spot on and make them beat us rather than giving it to them.\"\n\nCummings eyes silverware as he signs new Glasgow deal\n\nHow loss of brother shaped Smith's rugby journey\n\nEdinburgh's memories of their first visit to Hampden last season are ones they would rather forget. They were obliterated by Glasgow, falling 33-0 down before grabbing a couple of late consolation tries to take a slight edge off the embarrassing scoreline.\n\nSean Everitt's side are specialists at bouncing back from bad defeats, mainly because they have had so much practice at it. Edinburgh fans would love if, for once, their team were not made to suffer before producing a reaction, but rather came out at Hampden on the front foot.\n\nOne of the capital side's breakout stars this season, back-row Liam McConnell, believes that in Glasgow his team face not only their local rivals, but one of the best sides around. It is among the reasons he is relishing the tussle between the sides.\n\n\"I've never played in one,\" said the 21-year-old. \"I've been at the club for the last couple of seasons now and been around it when it's the 1872 Cup weeks. It's always special.\n\n\"The guys in the matchday squad have a different intensity around them, so to be part of it is pretty cool. Everyone's real focused for Saturday, you can tell.\n\n\"It'll be good. Glasgow are in good form right now, probably one of the best club teams in the world, you could say.\n\n\"It's not only 1872, we're playing one of the best club teams in the world at the moment, so that's a challenge in itself. I'm really excited.\"\n\nAll the feelgood factor and momentum generated from that famous win over Toulon was dynamited by Edinburgh fielding a weakened team and going down meekly to Castres.\n\nIt's a familiar narrative heading into the derby – Glasgow being showered with praise, Edinburgh being bombarded with questions and criticism.\n\nThe best way to change that would be to give Warriors a bloody nose in front of their own people on Saturday.\n\n\"There's no-one better to beat, is there?\" said Edinburgh hooker Ewan Ashman.\n\n\"We know they're a quality team and those are the games you want to play. Glasgow are a good side and that was a good win [against Toulouse].\n\n\"We've done similar a couple of weeks ago against Toulon, so we know the feeling. They'll be riding super high and they'll be coming in with confidence.\n\n\"It's the exact kind of challenge we're looking to take head-on. We need to show that fighting spirit.\"",

    "fullText": "Heading into Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors were riding a two-game losing streak. In each game, the Warriors held a lead in the fourth quarter, but struggled down the stretch on the way to losses.\n\nOn Thursday against the Phoenix Suns, the Warriors failed to close again, despite a heroic performance from Jimmy Butler. Behind Butler, the Warriors built a seven-point lead at halftime, yet heading into the fourth quarter, their lead dwindled down to one.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Suns took control as momentum swung their way. Yet, Butler, Steph Curry and the Warriors wouldn't go away. In the final minute, the Suns led by five points before Dillon Brooks committed a flagrant foul on Curry, sending him to the line for a pair of free throws. After the free throws from Curry, Butler knocked down a clutch 3-pointer to tie the game at 96. After Booker and Curry traded buckets to tie the game again at 98, Moses Moody committed a late foul on Jordan Goodwin in the final second of the game. Goodwin missed the first attempt from the line before hitting the game-winning free throw and dealt the Warriors their third straight loss, 99-98.\n\nButler finished with a game-high 31 points on 11-of-17 shooting from the field with three assists and three rebounds in 34 minutes. Butler's performance on Thursday night in Phoenix was his third game of the season scoring 30 or more points. Thursday also marked his highest scoring mark in a month.\n\nAlongside Butler, Brandin Podziemski put together a strong performance on Thursday, scoring 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting from the field with a pair of made 3-pointers in 28 minutes off the bench.\n\nWhile Podziemski and Butler helped fuel Golden State's offense, Steph Curry struggled, scoring 15 points on 3-of-13 shooting from the field and 2-of-9 from deep. Butler, Podziemski and Curry were the only members of the Warriors to tally double-figure scoring numbers. Draymond Green committed five of Golden State's 20 turnovers.\n\nAfter their third straight loss, the Warriors have fallen to 13-15 on the season. The Warriors will get the chance to avenge their loss from Thursday when the Suns travel back to the Bay Area on Saturday for a rematch at Chase Center.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Late free throws from Suns helps deal Warriors' third straight loss",

    "fullText": "When the Golden State Warriors return to the court on Thursday night, they will be without a pair of key rotational pieces against the Phoenix Suns. The Warriors will be missing veteran big man Al Horford and guard Pat Spencer on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nHorford has been missing time with a sciatica injury. Horford has missed seven of the last eight games, including four straight. Thursday night will be his fifth straight missed game. ESPN's Nick Friedell reports that Horford is still around another week away from returning from to the court as he continues to rehab from his sciatica injury.\n\nHorford said he is feeling better in his rehab — but he thinks he’s probably another week away from returning as he continues to deal with a sciatica issue.\n\n— Nick Friedell (@NickFriedell) December 18, 2025\n\nHorford has played 13 games in his first season for the Warriors, averaging 5.6 points on 32.1% shooting from the field and 29.8% from deep to go along with 4.4 rebounds per contest.\n\nWhile Horford is out on Thursday with his sciatica injury, Spencer is ruled out against the Suns for personal reasons. With Spencer and Horford out, Steve Kerr will have to lean on Golden State's depth, with players like Quinten Post, Brandin Podziemski, De'Anthony Melton and Gary Payton II potentially seeing a bigger role on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nThe Warriors will tip off against the Suns at 6 p.m. PT on Thursday night in the desert.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Injury Report: Al Horford, Pat Spencer out vs. Suns",

    "fullText": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea for gun control from Steve Kerr.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors coach spoke for about three minutes unprompted on Sunday night before their 136-131 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers and again called for gun reform in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University.\n\n“With what happened last night at Brown, it’s just a reminder to me that these shootings continue to happen, and there is something we can do about them. The loss that all of the people involved [Saturday] night, the loss that they’re feeling, it’s exactly the same loss as all the Parkland families, and every other mass shooting.\n\n“Nobody asked me about it today. I didn’t expect anybody to ask me. I doubt we’re gonna do a moment of silence out there because it’s human nature just to not want to deal with this stuff. And it’s human nature just to think, ‘This is so horrible. Let’s not even think about it.’ But we have to think about it.”\n\nSpeaking pregame, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr addresses gun violence following this weekend’s shooting at Brown University.\n\n“We know there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. … I just want people thinking ‘What if it were my child?’”\n\nMore: pic.twitter.com/E2n9z62jYZ\n\n— Sam Gordon (@BySamGordon) December 15, 2025\n\nA shooting took place at Brown University in Rhode Island on Saturday afternoon that left two people dead and nine others injured, according to The New York Times. An investigation is still ongoing. Authorities released a man who they had detained on Sunday night, and are still searching for the alleged gunman.\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, that was the 389th mass shootings in the United States so far this year. There have been others since.\n\nGun control is something that Kerr has been a strong advocate of for years. He’s spoken out about plenty of other mass shootings in the United States in the past, hosted a town hall about the issue, drawn support for groups founded by students who survived other mass shootings, and more. Kerr’s father, Malcolm, was shot and killed during a terrorist attack in Beirut in 1984 when Steve was a student at Arizona.\n\n“The vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Kerr said. “They have every right to own a gun. But it’s on us to decide if we actually want to take action as a country, as citizens. We know, we know that there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. And I just want people out there — it doesn’t matter if you’re Democrat or Republican, or gun owner, non-gun owner — I just want people thinking, ‘What if it were my child? What if it were my brother or sister?’ Would you be willing to stand up to your representatives and say, ‘You know what? Enough. I’m not gonna vote for you unless you are going to stand up for gun violence prevention through common-sense laws that the vast majority of Americans agree on.'\n\n“Or are we just gonna continue to let the gun lobby run us over and not do anything to protect each other, to protect our children, to protect our future. We have to make that decision.”\n\nKerr wasn't alone in the sports world, either. USC women's basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb, who played at Brown, spoke out on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's the guns,\" she said after the Trojans' loss to No. 1 UConn. \"We're the only country that lives this way.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time that Kerr has addressed this issue, and mass shootings continue to occur in the United States. Based on recent history, it likely won't be the last time we hear from Kerr about gun control, either.\n\nWhile Kerr knows how easy it would be to just give up and ignore the problem, especially since it seems like nothing is getting better, he ended his plea on Sunday night with a simple solution.\n\n“Don’t just look the other way, even though that’s human nature and I understand it,” Kerr said. “Think about it. Think about, do you want something done? Do you want your child to go to school terrified every day? Or do you want to actually take action?\n\n“Because that’s what a democracy is about. Where we demand that our representatives protect us. And that option is there. So, we can either just do what we’re continuing to do and let these things happen or make some demands. And so, as you’re thinking about this today, think about, what if it were your own family member?”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStephen Curry is doing everything in his power to keep the Golden State Warriors’ heads above water.\n\nThe 11-time All-Star was out of the franchise’s lineup for several contests due to a concerning right quad contusion, but has returned in style.\n\nCurry netted 39 points in his first game back against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night, but the Dubs still fell short in the end.\n\nOn Sunday night, the four-time NBA champion erupted for 48 points vs. the Portland Trail Blazers, but once again, Golden State came out on the losing end.\n\nThat said, the Warriors’ shortcomings as a unit shouldn’t overshadow the fact that Curry recently made basketball history that's never been done by an NBA point guard.\n\n“Steph Curry has the most 45-point games by a point guard in NBA history,” Real Sports wrote on X/Twitter.\n\nEven if Golden State is unable to reach its full potential this season, fans should expect more 45+ point explosions from the best shooter of all time.\n\nCurry isn’t the type of player who can get neutralized regularly, considering he’s been tasked with assuming a bulk of the offensive responsibilities for the seven-time NBA champions.\n\nCurry is averaging 28.5 points per game on 47.3% field goal shooting and 39.1% three-point shooting with Golden State this year. Simply put, the electric 6-foot-2 point guard’s history-making ways won’t stop here.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors' Stephen Curry broke another all-time Michael Jordan record",

    "fullText": "Tries: McKay, Brown, Tuipulotu Cons: Hastings 4\n\nTries: Dupont, Gourgues 2, Cons: Ramos 3\n\nGlasgow Warriors mounted an epic comeback from 21-0 down to beat French giants Toulouse in the Champions Cup on one of the club's greatest nights.\n\nIn torrential rain and gale-force winds, the six-time champions were still able to display all their signature power and precision in the first half as they threatened to comprehensively outclass their hosts.\n\nAntoine Dupont, making his first start in eight months after a serious knee injury, got the ball rolling with the opening try and a double from Kalvin Gourgues saw the visitors race into what looked like an unassailable lead at half-time.\n\nWarriors re-emerged like a team possessed and stunned Toulouse with tries from Josh McKay, Gregor Brown, Sione Tuipulotu and Gregor Hiddleston to send Scotstoun into raptures.\n\nA big cheer went up when Dupont's name was read out by the stadium announcer ahead of the match, and the little maestro wasted no time in showing his class.\n\nThibaud Flament burst through the Warriors defence and galloped into the 22, finding Dupont on his shoulder and he glided over for the opening try in a little over six minutes.\n\nDupont was instrumental as Toulouse struck again moments later, though the home crowd were furious as they were convinced his pass to send Gourgeus over for the second try was forward.\n\nWarriors seemed to be on referee Matthew Carley's bad side, with the penalty count and the pressure cranking up against them.\n\nThe home side were grimly hanging on for half-time, but Gourgeus shrugged off a weak tackle from Josh McKay to go over for his second and Toulouse's third.\n\nGlasgow survived another scare in the final play of the half when Ange Capuozzo's try was ruled out after he was just bundled into touch as he grounded in the corner, but at 21-0 at the break, the contest was all but done.\n\nOr was it? Glasgow needed something to offer a glimmer of hope and they got it when some slick handling set McKay free up the touchline to run in for the try.\n\nWhether it was some strong words at half-time from head coach Franco Smith, or turning around to play with the wind now at their backs, a flick had switched and suddenly Warriors were putting it up to their illustrious opponents.\n\nThe Glasgow bench was making an impact and one of the substitutes, Brown, blasted over from close range to reduce the arrears to seven points and bring Scotstoun to life.\n\nThe roof nearly came off the place when Tuipulotu finished off an a period of intense pressure on the Toulouse line, and when Adam Hastings banged over the conversion we were all square.\n\nStill Glasgow came. They had Toulouse rocking and they landed another blow, a rolling line-out maul thundering over the try-line with substitute Hiddleston touching down to give Warriors the lead for the first time.\n\nThe great teams often find their way out a hole, but on this particular night, the Toulouse Galacticos had the fight knocked out of them by an inspired Glasgow Warriors side on a beautifully bonkers evening at Scotstoun that will live long in the memory.\n\nGlasgow: McKay; Steyn, McDowall, Tuipulotu, Smith; Hastings, Dobie; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, M Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Horne, Lancaster.\n\nToulouse: Ramos; Capuozzo, Costes, Gourgues, Kinghorn; Ntamack, Dupont; Ainuu, Marchand, Aldegheri, Brennan, Flament, Willis, Banos, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Lacombre, Neti, Merkler, Meafou, Castro Ferreira, Roumat, Graou, Thomas.",
