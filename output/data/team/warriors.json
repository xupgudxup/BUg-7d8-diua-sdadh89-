Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMost of the talk last offseason regarding the Warriors was around what would happen with RFA Jonathan Kuminga.\n\nIt seemed like Kuminga and the Warriors were looking to go their separate ways, but it was a rough market for Kuminga and other RFAs, so he ended up agreeing to a two-year deal with the Warriors.\n\nDespite the two sides coming to a compromise in the offseason, we could expect Kuminga to be in his final days with the franchise, with a transaction happening sooner rather than later.\n\nTo start, since Kuminga had signed a new contract this summer, the team had to wait a certain amount of time before he was eligible to be traded this season.\n\nThe restriction on when he can be traded is lifted on Thursday this week, meaning he could technically be traded as soon as tomorrow.\n\nMORE: This might finally be the year the Bulls trade Nikola Vucevic at the deadline\n\nThe contract the Warriors gave Kuminga was certainly a short-term deal meant to get the two sides to a temporary solution, as it was evident that was the best that could be done at the time.\n\nThe Warriors find themselves just three games over .500 right now, and only have so much time left to capitalize on a window with Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler.\n\nKuminga hasn't been the only player on Golden State swirling around in trade rumors, so the Warriors could look to get aggressive in search of a second-half of the season surge.\n\nThere's a team option on Kuminga's contract for next season, which is another indicator that the Warriors wanted flexibility in how they deal with Kuminga and his contract.\n\nMORE: Raptors have interest in Domantas Sabonis, but would only give up these 3 players\n\nAs of now, it appears that the Kings remain the team with interest in Kuminga (per Michael Scotto), but that was the case this summer, and no deal was facilitated.\n\nThings could change, though, as the Warriors might choose to move on from Kuminga even if they don't get the exact desired return they hoped for.\n\nHowever, with the deadline quickly approaching and Kuminga eligible to be traded starting Thursday, more serious talks could materialize over the coming days and weeks around a new home for Kuminga.\n\nLeBron James' injury news means one of the NBA's most impressive streaks could be over\n\nWhy Knicks fans will have to root for New York villain Trae Young on the Wizards\n\nCeltics' Jaylen Brown has sarcastic wish granted, gets hefty fine after latest comments\n\nCaitlin Clark gives two-word reaction to Celtics backup center's recent success\n\nTrading for Ja Morant may be impossible for one key reason\n\nCeltics use hilarious NBA 2K data method to prepare for Raptors game",

    "fullText": "Proposed Warriors trade involving Jonathan Kuminga lands $179 million ex-Nuggets star originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are counting down the days until Jonathan Kuminga is trade-eligible.\n\nWhen Jan. 15 arrives, the Dubs will have the luxury of exploring franchise-bolstering trades involving the 6-foot-7 NBA champion forward. In a hypothetical three-team deal centered around Kuminga, Golden State would land a 27-year-old ex-Denver Nuggets star.\n\n“The Warriors have not exactly been shy about making their stance on trading Jonathan Kuminga known, and on paper, a trade structure between them and the (Brooklyn) Nets should be pretty straightforward,” ClutchPoints’ Jedd Pagaduan wrote Sunday.\n\n“Alas, the Nets haven't been very interested in Kuminga anyway, which might call into necessity the involvement of a third team. Thankfully for both teams, there is a franchise that remainshead over heels for Kuminga in the Sacramento Kings. That still seems to be Kuminga's likeliest destination, as the franchise currently in shambles has an opening for a primary scoring option, which he could fill in theory.\n\n“To that end, here is a workable three-team trade proposal that satisfies the Warriors, Nets, and Kings' demands (Michael Porter Jr to the Warriors, Zach LaVine, Devin Carter, Buddy Hield, and three future draft picks to the Nets, and Kuminga, Terance Mann, and Moses Moody to the Kings.”\n\nPorter has been on the Warriors’ radar since the 2024-25 trade season. The Missouri product’s deadeye three-point shooting makes him one of the prolific long-range weapons the NBA has to offer.\n\nSince leaving the Nuggets this past offseason, Porter has not only continued to set the nets on fire but also taken his scoring to the next level (thanks to the Nets allowing him to assume No. 1 scorer/playmaking responsibilities).\n\nPorter is contributing 25.9 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game with Brooklyn this season, shooting 49.0% from the field and 39.7% from three-point land.\n\nIn an ideal world, the Warriors would find a way to poach Porter from the Nets and get back on track as a franchise.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors predicted to cut ties with underachieving $86.2 million duo via trade",

    "description": "There was likely a familial relation between two of the fallen warriors—father and son—but the third body’s tie to the two was more unclear.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAmateur archaeologists in Hungary discovered three 1,100-year-old burials of a trio of warriors.\n\nTwo of the warriors were teenagers at the time of their death and a third was likely the father of the youngest warrior.\n\nA range of high-status grave goods was discovered with the burials, including silver, gold, and weapons.\n\nVolunteer archaeologists in Hungary discovered the 1,100-year-old bodies of a trio of warriors—along with not only some unique familial ties among the deceased, but also plenty of elite-level artifacts with gold, silver, and ancient weaponry.\n\nDiscovered outside of Akasztó in Hungary, over 55 miles from Budapest, the three warriors’ graves were dated to the 920s or 930s C.E., a key moment in the Hungarian conquest. Located by volunteers from the Kecskemét Soldier József Museum’s community archaeology program, the bodies were found during an excavation led by archaeologists with the museum.\n\nThe first grave belonged to a warrior who was between 17 and 18 years old at the time of his death, according to a translated statement from the Pulszky Society Hungarian Museum Association. He was certainly part of an elite class, as the grave goods included a silver tarsoly plate, one of only about 30 that have been found in the Carpathian Basin.\n\nThe plate was enough to indicate an elite status for the teenage warrior, but the grave also contained a gold ring set with blue glass stones still on the deceased’s left hand, two gold hoops in his hair, and decorative silver arm and leg rings. The grave itself featured silk, leather, and wooden elements that the experts hope to continue to analyze.\n\nThe warrior’s horse had an interesting final rite as well. The animal—at least the head, legs, and hide—were included in the burial alongside a gilded silver harness. Experts, though, believe the rest of the horse was eaten during the funeral rites or at least burned during the event.\n\nThe museum officials called it “great fortune” the tomb was not robbed, as it is one of the “richest burials in the Tisza region.”\n\nA second tomb held an even younger warrior, likely just 15 or 16 years old. His grave included a bow and a quiver with seven arrows, according to Live Science. Decorative antler plates highlighted the bow handles.\n\nThe third grave featured archery equipment as well, alongside a 10th-century saber. Experts believe the warrior in the third grave was between 30 and 35 years old and likely the father of the youngest warrior, although they believe all three were probably related in some way. The older warrior also had a silver bracelet and a coin-adorned horse harness. In all, the archaeologists uncovered 81 coins, mostly from northern Italy, which the warriors could have obtained while fighting there.\n\nThe museum’s experts said that while all three were likely connected genetically, they may have also been connected through battle, and the father-son duo may have been the first warrior’s bodyguards.\n\nEarly analysis of all three bodies showed they enjoyed a diet high in animal proteins, but there were no clues as to the cause of death of the warrior trio.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

He fouled out for the first time since Dec. 17, 2021, at Boston.\n\nJames Harden was a late scratch for the Clippers because of right shoulder soreness. But they got double-figure scoring from all five starters, including Sanders, whose points were a career high. Collins added 18 points and Kris Dunn had 16. Ivica Zubac had 11 rebounds.\n\nJimmy Butler added 24 points for the Warriors, who lost to the Clippers for the eighth straight time on the road.\n\nCurry fouled Dunn with 42 seconds left and the Warriors trailing 101-100 after Curry's back-to-back 3-pointers. Dunn made both free throws before Draymond Green scored in the lane to pull the Warriors within one.\n\nLeonard missed a jumper and the Warriors grabbed the defensive rebound. Butler missed a 16-footer before time expired.\n\nNeither team shot well from 3. The Clippers were 10 for 29, while the Warriors were 10 for 41.\n\nThe Warriors closed within four early in the fourth before the Clippers outscored them 16-7 to lead 94-81. Leonard scored six and Collins had five.\n\nGolden State ran off nine straight, including seven by Butler, to trail 94-90.\n\nGolden State had won six of eight coming into what was a playoff-like atmosphere that included rapper Snoop Dogg doing commentary for the game streamed on Peacock. It was a matchup of the NBA's two oldest teams. The average age of the Clippers' roster is 30.0 to 29.6 for the Warriors.\n\nGreen dove for a loose ball and crashed into his team's bench late in the first half. The team said he sustained a rib contusion, but he remained in the game. Green had 12 assists while going 0 of 6 from 3-point range.\n\nWarriors: Host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday in the opener of an eight-game homestand.\n\nClippers: Visit the New York Knicks on Wednesday to open a three-game Eastern trip.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

A rolling line-out maul was sent towards the Zebre line, scrum-half Ben Afshar peeled off and drew the defence before popping inside for McDowall to glide over untouched.\n\nFull-back Smith continued his excellent recent form with a fabulous second try, showing tremendous pace and footwork to slice through the defence and go in under the sticks.\n\nZebre struck against the run of play when Bertaccini crossed, but Glasgow re-established the two-score advantage just before half-time when hooker Stephen finished off a driving maul.\n\nThe Italians were not done yet and powered a rolling maul over the line for substitute hooker Quattrini to dot down.\n\nWarriors dampened the visitors' enthusiasm with a brilliantly engineered fourth try to seal the bonus point.\n\nSome exquisite handling created space for Duncan Munn to deftly chip ahead and nobody was beating Dobie in the race to the corner. Weir, having entered the action a few minutes earlier, banged over the conversion from the touchline.\n\nGlasgow used the maul to great effect once again to send substitute Hiddleston over for try number five.\n\nThe sixth almost raised the Scotstoun roof as Dobie made a searing break up the touchline, stepped inside and found Weir to send the club great over for one final try before he moves into an academy coaching role.\n\nDobie added another to round off a very satisfying evening for Franco Smith's side.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: Smith, Munn, McDowall, Yule, Dobie, Hastings, Afshar, Schickerling, Stephen, Richardson, Oguntibeju, Williamson, Ferrie, Darge, Duncan.\n\nReplacements: Hiddleston, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Miller, Oliver, Weir, Lancaster.\n\nZebre: Pani, Belloni, Bertaccini, Lucchin, Batista, Roger, Dominguez, Buonfiglio, Klein, Pieretto, Canali, Carrera, Volpi, Bianchi, Ruggeri.\n\nReplacements: Quattrini, Franceschetto, Nocera, Milano, Odiase, Prinsloo, Montemauri, Morisi.",

Gui Santos added 13 points off the bench, hitting three 3s for Golden State, which went 24 of 49 from beyond the arc.\n\nBrandon Miller led Charlotte with 33 points, while LaMelo Ball finished with 27, going 7 of 10 from 3-point range. Rookie Kon Knueppel added 20 points in his return from a one-game absence because of a sprained ankle.\n\nCharlotte played without starters Miles Bridges and Ryan Kalkbrenner because of injuries.\n\nThe Warriors led 69-64 lead at halftime behind four 3s and 15 points from Curry — who grew up in Charlotte and played college ball at nearby Davidson — and appeared on the verge of blowing out the Hornets after starting the third quarter on a 10-0 run. But Charlotte quickly turned the tables with Ball hitting three 3s, helping the Hornets put together a 32-12 run to take the lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe momentum swung back to the Warriors after Podziemski knocked down two 3s to open the fourth.\n\nThe Warriors held the lead throughout the rest of the fourth quarter and Draymond Green’s tip-in off a Curry miss from deep with 1 minute remaining pushed the lead to six. Butler hit two free throws with 17 seconds left to seal the win.\n\nPodziemski finished 5 of 7 from 3-point range, including a leaning 3-pointer off one foot to beat the shot clock.\n\nThe Hornets lost despite outscoring the Warriors 56-32 in the paint.\n\nATLANTA (AP) — Jalen Johnson scored 34 points and Atlanta overcame Anthony Edwards’ 30 points for Minnesota to beat the Timberwolves and end a seven-game losing streak.\n\nAtlanta took control by outscoring Minnesota 37-23 in the second quarter to lead 70-49 at halftime.\n\nJohnson added 10 rebounds and six assists. Onyeka Okongwu had 17 points and Dyson Daniels added 11 points, eight rebounds and nine assists. Daniels also had two steals and two blocks.\n\nThe Hawks claimed their first win since beating Philadelphia 120-117 on Dec. 14 and improved to 6-11 at home.\n\nThe Hawks were bolstered by the return of Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 16 points in 17 minutes off the bench after missing 10 games with an illness.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Paolo Banchero had 29 points and 10 rebounds and hit the go-ahead basket with 7.5 seconds remaining as Orlando rallied from a 10-point, third-quarter deficit and beat Indiana, sending the Pacers to their 10th consecutive loss.\n\nAs the clock was winding down in regulation, Banchero backed down Aaron Nesmith and banked home an 11-foot shot for the final basket in a game that included 12 ties and 11 lead changes. The power forward finished 12 of 21 from the field and 5 for 7 at the line.\n\nNesmith missed a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 3.1 seconds remaining.\n\nOrlando’s Desmond Bane scored 18, Anthony Black added 15 and former Pacers center Goga Bitadze 14.\n\nThe Magic (19-15), who have been without leading scorer Franz Wagner (22.7 points per game) since Dec. 7 due to a high-ankle sprain, welcomed back point guard Jalen Suggs from a seven-game absence with a hip issue.

The All-Star guard — fourth in the league in scoring at 29.7 points per game — was 10 of 18 from the field, including four 3-pointers, and also had 10 rebounds and seven assists in 30 minutes.\n\nJaylon Tyson had 18 points and Sam Merrill added 16. Evan Mobley (16 points, 10 rebounds) and Jarrett Allen (16 points, 11 rebounds) both had double-doubles.\n\nCleveland has won two straight and improved to 19-16 after going 7-7 in December.\n\nDevin Booker led Phoenix with 32 points, including 20 in the third quarter as the Suns rallied from a 67-54 halftime deficit to get within two late in the quarter. Dillon Brooks had 20 points, all in the first half, and Collin Gillespie added 17.\n\nAfter Phoenix got within 91-89 on a pair of free throws by Jordan Goodwin, the Cavaliers regained control with a 24-5 run as Mitchell scored eight points and Tyson added six.

You have to go back to 2016 to find a season with more tryless games.\n\nThe changing of the coach may not be a panacea. But who dictates and implements the culture at a club? Who is responsible for the style of play? Who chooses the players and the supporting coaching staff? We can't change the squad en masse so that leaves one option whether it fits the narrative or not.\n\nEdinburgh need a coach with drive and a sense of purpose because we are rudderless and only our lack of direction is preventing us from running aground entirely.\n\nSandy Smith can be found at The Burgh Watch",

The 3-point chucking pair helped lead the Warriors to four championships in seven seasons.\n\nCurry rocking Thompson’s signature shoes is a fitting way to pay homage to his former teammate, while playing against him, as The Dallas Morning News’ Mike Curtis noted.\n\n“Didn’t notice this until now, but sneaker free agent Stephen Curry is wearing Klay Thompson’s shoes by ANTA,” Curtis reported.\n\nDidn’t notice this until now, but sneaker free agent Stephen Curry is wearing Klay Thompson’s shoes by ANTA. pic.twitter.com/Ih0F69O5wn\n\n— Mike Curtis (@MikeACurtis2) December 25, 2025\n\nCurry became the 22nd player in NBA history to score 26,000+ points in his career in the third quarter of the Warriors’ 10-point win against the Mavs.\n\n26,000 CAREER POINTS FOR STEPH CURRY!\n\nThe 22nd player in NBA history to reach that mark 🤩 pic.twitter.com/JBX4zU0UiA\n\nCurry finished with 23 points on 6-of-18 shooting and a perfect 9-for-9 from the free-throw line. He also finished with four assists and three rebounds. Klay Thompson scored seven points on 3-of-8 attempts off the bench, two rebounds, two assists, one steal, and one block for the Mavs.\n\nMavericks rookie Cooper Flagg impressed Warriors All-Star Stephen Curry with his game-high 27-point performance in Thursday’s Christmas Day matchup. Flagg, who has participated in Curry’s basketball camp before entering the NBA, went 13-of-21 from the floor and finished with six rebounds, five assists, and one block in his first matchup against Steph and the Warriors.\n\nAfter the game, in his walk-off interview, Curry discussed what he sees in Flagg’s future, per NBA on ESPN’s X (formerly Twitter).\n\n“Just a true hooper. Competitor. You forget how young he is — just his presence out there on the court,” Curry said. “So, the future is bright. I’m glad he got this experience in his first year to understand what the bright lights feel like. The league is in good hands.”\n\n\"Just a true hooper.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe future status of Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga remains one of the most fascinating in the NBA, and trade talks involving him are growing louder.\n\nBleacher Report's Eric Pincus proposed an eight-team deal that would send Kuminga elsewhere and reunite Klay Thompson with the Warriors. The full trade involves the Warriors, Jazz, Mavericks, Magic, Nets, Nuggets, Raptors and Suns.\n\nGolden State would receive Thompson, Jonathan Isaac, Day'Ron Sharpe, Garrett Temple and a Jazz 2027 first-round pick. Kuminga would head to Utah, along with Hunter Tyson (Nuggets) and Nigel Hayes-Davis (Suns). Buddy Hield, Al Horford and Trayce Jackson-Davis would also be moved from the Warriors in the deal.\n\n\"The Warriors satisfy Curry's wishes, getting Thompson to replace Hield, who has struggled to hit shots this season,\" Pincus said. \"The trio (with Draymond Green) would be on the path to close their historic runs together through the 2026-27 season, provided Green opts into the final year of his contract.\"\n\nMORE: Ben Simmons is going pro in a sport you'd never expect\n\nThompson would return to Golden State, where he spent 13 seasons before being traded to Dallas in the 2024 offseason. Kuminga, who's seen a diminished role with the Warriors this season, would get a fresh start.\n\n\"Perhaps more importantly, the team gains necessary closure on the drawn-out Jonathan Kuminga saga, which left him a restricted free agent for most of the summer and currently has the 23-year-old forward out of coach Steve Kerr's rotation.\"\n\nThe eight-team deal would be the largest trade in NBA history, passing the Houston Rockets' trade for Kevin Durant last summer.\n\nSteph's quote about Klay will bring a tear to Warriors fans\n\nJoe Mazzulla wants to get a pet wolf\n\nSteven Adams has the craziest eating habits in the NBA\n\nAnthony Edwards had an \"I'm him\" moment vs. Thunder\n\nWe finally know how Michael Jordan really feels about Scottie Pippen\n\nCooper Flagg's clutch stats are unprecedented",

    "fullText": "Things seemed set up for the Golden State Warriors to make another run at a championship during the 2025-26 season. Unfortunately, the high potential they showed after trading for Jimmy Butler earlier this year has completely disappeared, and they enter Christmas Day with a 15-15 record.\n\nMaking matters worse was a Monday argument between Steve Kerr and Draymond Green that ended with the forward leaving the bench and being MIA for much of the third quarter. It was just the latest incident with the team great. While Kerr apologized for the verbal dustup, it may just be the latest sign the organization must move on from the 35-year-old.\n\nIf they did take the bold step of trading Draymond Green before February’s deadline, here are five teams that might target a trade, including the Detroit Pistons.\n\nWhen he was a free agent a few years ago, there were rumblings that Green’s home state team, the Pistons, had interest. In the end, he stayed with Golden State. But now may be the perfect time for him to return home. Detroit owns the best record in the East, and the very young team could use more veteran leadership with rings on its resume.\n\nGreen would certainly be motivated by returning home to a contending team and could be a huge X-factor for Detroit in the second half of the season.\n\nAfter playing well in November, the Miami Heat have struggled mightily in December. Surprisingly, their defense has been the big problem, and they are a bottom-10 team in points against. If they are allowed to move Terry Rozier’s contract while suspended, why not make a trade for Green?\n\nHe would certainly help improve them on defense and be a nice addition to a team that already has Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, and Norman Powell.\n\nThe Houston Rockets are a serious title contender. The loss of Fred VanVleet for the season led to an interesting pivot to going big with their lineup and ball handlers. Certain impact guards may be out of their price range on the trade market, but Green is another big ball handler who could come at a more affordable rate.\n\nPlus, he fits in nicely with their defensive style and is another big moment veteran for a group that aspires to win it all this spring.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns have been one of the nice surprises in the NBA this season. What makes their rise back to relevancy even more interesting is that it has been led by a far better defense than anyone expected. Owner Matt Ishbia is willing to make bold moves, especially when he has a soft spot for a player. Could the Michigan State alum trade for a fellow Spartan before the trade deadline? It should not be ruled out.\n\nPlus, Green and Dillon Brooks on the same team would be must-see TV when it comes to in-game psychology.\n\nThe Warriors have been linked to Dallas Mavericks star Anthony Davis in recent trade rumors. Could a swap for Draymond Green be a possibility?\n\nDallas would certainly be open to it because they would regain a lot of cap flexibility in the deal. Golden State would also welcome the chance to get an elite-level big — when healthy — for the stretch run. Furthermore, Green being reunited with Klay Thompson could be an added motivation for the Golden State legend.\n\nTennessee Titans Doing Research on Top College Football Coach\n\nCavaliers Make Monster Trade For Giannis, and 4 Other Bold Ideas to Save the Season\n\nDallas Cowboys Could Cut Two Pricey Pro Bowl Defenders",

    "description": "The Golden State Warriors veteran forward has offered to come off the bench if it helps the team",
    "fullText": "The Golden State Warriors are still searching for the right combination of talent, both in the starting lineup and off the bench. Steve Kerr's job has been made harder by the team's brutal schedule to start the season and the string f injuries throughout the roster. As such, we're yet to see what the Warriors can do when they're working with a sustained period of health.\n\nNevertheless, Kerr and his veteran leaders are undoubtedly looking for ways to help give the team a boost. According to Kerr, speaking at a post-practice news conference, Draymond Green has offered to come off the bench if the coaching staff believes it will give the team the balance it needs. Kerr, however, is not currently looking to make that change.\n\n“He told me, this year, ‘I'll go to the bench if you need me to.’ I know what Draymond is about,\" Kerr said. \"He's about winning...That's not even a consideration for me right now,” he said, “Because I'm really excited about this starting lineup: Steph, Draymond, Moses (Moody), (Quinten Post), Jimmy, I think it's a great starting lineup for us, because we get the size and shooting of Quentin next to Dray, which takes the pressure off of him. And Dre is at his best next to Steph. He should play most of his minutes with Steph. Those two guys are incredible together.\"\n\nGreen has struggled on offense this season. He's got more personal fouls than he does made field goals. However, he's still an integral part of the starting lineup and is operating as the team's primary playmaker. Furthermore, his defensive IQ and ability to quarterback a defense provide an important leadership dynamic that helps set a tone to begin the game.\n\nNevertheless, if the Warriors continue to struggle building momentum, Kerr may look to experiment with different roster combinations in the future, and there is always the potential for Green to move into a second unit role later in the year.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Steve Kerr reveals selfless offer from Draymond Green",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are one of the most successful teams of the 21st century. They have four championships with Steve Kerr as the head coach and Stephen Curry as the superstar. Of course, they also had Draymond Green and Klay Thompson across all championships, which made them a modern NBA dynasty.\n\nUnfortunately, the Warriors' core has aged, as they are in their mid-to-late 30s now. Kerr admits that the Warriors are not at their best anymore, which is an inevitability, considering Father Time is undefeated.\n\nIn today's NBA, the Warriors are one of the teams that are stuck in limbo. They want to be successful, as seen with the quality of players they have on the roster. Unfortunately, their core might be too old to compete against the younger teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nKerr wants his team to remain competitive, but it might not happen anymore because the Warriors' time has passed. They were once a dynasty that almost every other NBA team feared, but now, they are not seen as a title contender anymore.\n\nMore: Cam Johnson and Trey Murphy believe Steph Curry is the most unique player ever\n\nThis is a new look at the Warriors because many have seen them as a perennial contender for almost a decade. Today, they are eighth in the Western Conference standings with a 15-15 record. This is not what people are used to seeing, which is why Kerr is a bit tentative with his current roster.\n\n\"I feel really good about where our team is on the floor, where we're heading, I see the potential in doing exactly what we did last year, to really go on a run, and give ourselves a chance... Most importantly for me, is that there is beauty in the struggle. We are no longer the '17 Warriors dominating the league, we are a fading dynasty, we know that,\" Kerr said about his team and their chances this season.\n\nHe wants his team to play well, as he believes in his players. However, that might not be enough because the Warriors are not the same team they once were during their dynasty era with Curry, Green, Thompson, and Kevin Durant.\n\nMoving forward, the Warriors will work hard to become a top team again, but it is looking unlikely, considering the core's age and how well the rest of the NBA has improved at beating the Warriors.\n\nJalen Williams believes more reps will help solve the Thunder's back-to-back issues\n\nThis Draymond Green stat is atrocious for Warriors legend\n\nNew Stephen Curry video has Warriors fans convinced he has the worst whistle in the NBA\n\nJames Harden blasted as 'foul baiter' by opposing head coach\n\nKevin Durant reacts to being benched for 4th quarter of Rockets loss",

After an animated exchange, Green decided to remove himself and left for the Chase Center locker rooms.\n\nAlthough he eventually returned to the bench, he didn't check back into the game.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nKerr said he and his do-it-all forward had a \"great chat\" Wednesday. The longtime Warriors head coach said he and Green apologized to each other as well as to the team.\n\nKerr explained that it was not his finest hour, nor was it a good look for his group.\n\n\"That was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange,\" Kerr said Wednesday.\n\n\"These things, they happen, especially when you get two incredibly competitive people like Dray and me. So over the 12 years we've been together, this has happened occasionally, and I'm not proud of it.\"\n\nKerr added: \"I care so much about Draymond, and the relationship we have is like family. And like family, you go through ups and downs. And my No. 1 goal honestly is for him to finish his career as a Warrior with us fighting — metaphorically, not literally — and competing together until we're both gone. And I believe that's going to happen because I believe in Draymond, and I believe in myself and I believe in everything we've built for 12 years.\"\n\nFull soundbite of Steve Kerr on the heated exchange with Draymond Green:\n\n“I regret my actions in that exchange and I apologized to Dray, he apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\nKerr reflected on their 12 years of winning together, expressing his belief in Green. pic.twitter.com/xpWhHFwZoA\n\n— Kenzo Fukuda (@kenzofuku) December 24, 2025\n\nThe Warriors famously selected Green out of Michigan State with the 35th overall pick in the second round of the 2012 draft. Kerr has coached him from the 2014-15 season on. Since, Green has emerged as a four-time All-Star, one-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. Together, Kerr and Green have won four NBA championships.\n\nWhile Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and then Kevin Durant, consistently shot the lights out, Green has left his own mark on the organization: with defensive tenacity, heady court vision and physical rebounding, plus timely scoring.\n\n\"We have four banners out there, and obviously a lot of people have played important roles in that, but I've said this before, and I truly believe it. I don't think we have any without Draymond. That's how much he impacts winning.\n\n\"So his ability to channel that passion, that emotion, that raw rage that he has is a key component to what makes us successful. And what I said about the other night, I didn't channel my own raw emotion and rage, of which there is plenty. We are far more alike than anyone would ever realize.\"\n\nKerr cited a long history of turning negative moments into positive momentum during his relationship with Green, who Kerr described as \"very complex.\" While Green has racked up technical fouls and served his fair share of suspensions for outbursts during a 14-season NBA career, he's also known for his basketball acumen and his contemplative commentary.\n\n\"We've always, always found a way to not only bounce back, but to make strides as a result,\" Kerr said, via Warriors reporter Kenzo Fukuda.\n\nWith the win over the Magic, the Warriors improved to 15-15. They've won back-to-back games for the fifth time this season. But they've still yet to string together more than three victories in a row.\n\nThis version of Golden State is spearheaded by Curry, Green and Jimmy Butler III. They're all at least 35 years old. Butler is a Warriors transplant who helped spark a second-half run last season, which ended in the Western Conference semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in the first game of the series.\n\n\"Where we are as a team, as an organization, the most important thing for me is for guys to recognize that there's beauty in the struggle. There's beauty in what we're trying to accomplish right now,\" Kerr said Wednesday, via The San Francisco Standard's Danny Emerman.\n\n\"We are no longer the '17 Warriors, dominating the league. We are a fading dynasty. We know that. Everyone knows that. So what is up to us? How do we carry ourselves night to night? How connected are we? And can we give ourselves another swing at the plate? We did that last year. I was really proud of the team last year. Despite the loss to Minnesota, injury to Steph. Who knows how long we would've gone? But we gave ourselves a chance. That's the goal here.\n\n\"We know where we are. We've got to know who we are, we've got to know what's possible, and we've got to take pride in the struggle, because this is part of life.\"\n\nKerr said he believes sorting out the tiff with Green has been a major step in this Warriors team working through its issues.\n\nHe sees an opportunity for Golden State to make another run like last year's.\n\nAs for Green, Kerr wants him to finish his career in a Warriors uniform.\n\n\"He's undyingly loyal and passionate, and I will go to bat for him as long as I'm coaching him here,\" Kerr said, per Emerman. \"Honestly, I'd go to bat for him 20 years from now when we haven't been together. That's how strongly I feel about him. And that's how I want this thing to end with us, whenever that is.\"",

We both apologized to the team.”\n\n— Joseph Dycus (@joseph_dycus) December 24, 2025\n\nGreen, a four-time champion in 13 seasons with the Warriors, said after Monday's game to reporters that \"tempers spilled over\".\n\n\"I just thought it was best that I get out of there,\" Green said. \"I don't think it was a situation where it was going to get better, so it was best to remove myself.\"\n\nThe cause of the argument Green said was basketball.\n\n\"It's what we do,\" he said. \"We play basketball. It's an emotional game. People lose their emotions sometimes, it happens. It is what it is. We've been at this now for a long time. Sometimes you're with people for a long time there's a level of comfort and it happens. We move forward.\"\n\nReporters on Monday asked if it was something that would linger on, but Green dismissed it saying they would \"move forward\".\n\n\"We'll move forward, we're alright,\" Green said regarding his spat with Kerr.\n\nThe Warriors are currently have a .500 record after 30 games, sitting at the eighth spot in the Western Conference. They have a Christmas Day game Thursday against the Dallas Mavericks and their rookie sensation Cooper Flagg at Chase Center in San Francisco.\n\n\"I think we're headed in the right direction,\" Green said to reporters Monday. \"No one's happy about being 15-15.

The Warriors selected Green in the second round of the 2012 NBA Draft, and he’s spent his entire career with the franchise. Kerr took over as the team’s head coach ahead of the 2014-15 campaign, and Green has been a key part of the four championships they’ve won at Golden State.\n\nClearly, Green and Kerr aren't on the same page right now. While Green hasn't spoken on the incident yet, Kerr is, at least publicly, trying to move forward.\n\n“We need Draymond.

It would have been a disastrous loss for Golden State, as it would have been their fourth consecutive defeat. Thankfully for the Warriors, Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler combined for 53 points.\n\nDraymond Green only got to play eight minutes, as he was ejected from the game with two technical fouls. It was a surprising call because most people did not expect that to happen, but the Warriors had to play almost the whole game without their best defender.\n\nWarriors head coach Steve Kerr admits that at least one technical foul was warranted because Green was talking to the referees. However, Kerr disliked that the second technical was quickly called on Green, which led to the ejection.\n\nKerr was livid about the call, which led to him also getting a technical foul.

Pre-meditated, punches him in the stomach, no ejection for that,\" Kerr said after the game.\n\nDillon Brooks was the player that Kerr was talking about, which was why he was livid. Kerr wanted to call it out because it was not the best moment for the referees, given the context a couple of days prior.\n\nThe Warriors needed a win after their struggles in the past few weeks. They lost to the same Suns team on Thursday, so they wanted to get revenge for that. However, it was a tough matchup for the Warriors, especially when Green got ejected.\n\nThankfully for the Warriors, Curry and Butler stepped up in his place. Curry himself credited the ejection as some sort of a wake-up call for the Warriors, as they needed that to get the win.\n\nMore: Warriors' Steph Curry makes basketball history never done in NBA for his position\n\n\"Yeah, it's tough.

It spilled into the second, I think it woke us up because we knew without him, we had to play tougher,\" Curry said after the game about the ejection.\n\nNow, the Warriors are 14-15 on the season, clinging to the eighth seed in the Western Conference.

This year, he’s producing 8.5 points per game, while coming down with 6.1 rebounds and blocking 1.5 shots in 17 games.\n\nThe Mavericks are currently paying $14.3 million to Gafford. He has a $54 million extension kicking in next season.\n\nWhile he only has two playoff runs on his resume, Gafford had a meaningful postseason run in 2024 with 22 appearances, maintaining his regular-season averages.\n\nNic Claxton of the Brooklyn Nets is another reported target for Golden State. Although the Nets invested nearly $100 million in Claxton last year, they remain in a rebuilding mode. Sitting 13th in the Eastern Conference with a 7-19 record, the Nets are expected to operate as sellers ahead of the deadline.\n\nSince 2019, Claxton has been a part of three playoff runs in Brooklyn. Between 2022 and 2023, the Nets faced two first-round sweeps, limiting Claxton's chances of improving his postseason value. Despite the lack of experience, Claxton is a logical candidate.\n\nLastly, the Portland Trail Blazers center, Robert Williams, is gaining attention from the Warriors’ front office, according to Haynes. The 28-year-old former first-round pick is in year three with the Portland Trail Blazers after spending several seasons with the Boston Celtics.\n\nWilliams was a defensive standout with the Celtics before leaving for Portland in 2023. Since his exit from the Celtics, Williams has struggled to stay healthy. He underwent multiple knee surgeries over the past couple of years, limiting his production with the Blazers.\n\nThis season, Williams has appeared in 17 games for the Blazers. With an average of 15 minutes of playing time off the bench, he has produced averages of 5.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks this year.\n\nThe idea of Williams on the Warriors might seem great, but his injury history is certainly a concern.\n\nWhile Williams, Gafford, and Claxton are three names to keep an eye on in December, several other options could pop up for the Warriors as the season plays out. It’s unclear who the Warriors will end up with, but the 13-15 squad from Golden State is expected to make some important roster changes before the market closes.",

The Warriors have lost three straight games and six out of their last 10. They currently sit ninth in the Western Conference standings with an underwhelming record of 13-15 – not quite where they expected to be at this stage of the season.\n\nIn their most recent game, the Warriors lost to the Phoenix Suns by one point, 99-98. Luckily, they won’t have to wait too long for a shot at revenge, as the two teams are set to square off again on Saturday night.\n\nThe Warriors will be without a couple of key contributors for the contest as Seth Curry and Al Horford have both been ruled out due to injuries. But, the good news for the team is that superstar guard Steph Curry will be available, as he’s not listed on the official injury report for the game against Phoenix.\n\nCurry appears to have recovered completely from the quad injury that cost him five games earlier this month. The showdown with the Suns on Saturday will be the fourth consecutive game played in by Curry after that string of absences.\n\nUnfortunately, Curry’s return to action hasn’t correlated to winning for Golden State as the Warriors have dropped all three games since his return. But, there’s no question that him being available gives the Warriors their best chance at winning.\n\nOn the season, Curry is averaging 28.8 points, 4.1 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals per performance.",

Adam Hastings looked for Jamie Dobie with a cross-field kick and he was crudely taken out in the air by Ben Vellacott.\n\nThe penalty was kicked to the corner, the Glasgow pack rumbled over and Hiddleston touched down to put Glasgow two scores clear.\n\nEdinburgh finally showed signs of life in attack and engineered a golden opportunity for Darcy Graham out wide, but Ollie Smith, outstanding all day, covered superbly to bundle the little winger into touch.\n\nThe capital side did make things more interesting when Gilchrist barrelled over – though replays suggested he may have been short of the line when he grounded the ball - to bring his side back within seven.\n\nAny hint of a late comeback was extinguished when substitute Stephen finished off a rolling line-out maul to seal the bonus-point win and secure a handy aggregate cushion to take into next week's second leg at Murrayfield.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: Smith, Steyn (c), McDowall, Tuipulotu, Dobie; Hastings, Horne; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Afshar, Lancaster.\n\nEdinburgh: Goosen, Graham, O'Conor, Currie, Van der Merwe; Scott, Vellacott; Schoeman, Ashman, O Blyth-Lafferty, Young, Gilchrist, McConnell, Richardson, Bradbury.\n\nReplacements: Harris, Venter, Hill, Hunter-Hill, Douglas, McAlpine, Thompson, Davidson.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks haven’t played the type of basketball they were hoping for throughout the season, but a lot of that can be due to the fact that Giannis Antetokounmpo simply hasn’t been on the court much.\n\nAntetokounmpo has seemingly made it known that he isn’t exactly happy with everything going on in Milwaukee, but from his perspective, it’s also a bit unfair.\n\nRegardless, it doesn’t sound like the Bucks want to move on from him, and although anything is possible in this league, it doesn’t seem like anything is imminent on that front.\n\nDespite that reality, Michael Scotto of HoopsHype had the latest on the Golden State Warriors’ pursuit of the superstar, adding that despite the unlikelihood of him being traded, the Warriors and other teams around the league are still calling.\n\n“In fact, rival executives interested in trading for Antetokounmpo who’ve spoken with HoopsHype said they don’t believe Milwaukee wants to move him right now. With that said, it’s unlikely to keep teams such as the New York Knicks, Miami Heat, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Houston Rockets, and others from continuing to monitor Antetokounmpo’s situation to varying degrees, looking ahead,” he wrote.\n\nIt’s tough to find the perfect package from the Warriors’ perspective.\n\nNot many teams around the league want Jonathan Kuminga, so unless Golden State is willing to part ways with other key pieces, there will likely be stronger offers available for the Bucks.\n\nWarriors' Steph Curry made a crazy discovery during his legendary pregame warmup\n\nWarriors get major Klay Thompson trade update involving Stephen Curry\n\nIs Steph Curry playing tonight vs. Suns?

    "description": "If Edinburgh turn over high-flying Glasgow Warriors at Hampden on Saturday, it would be a shock on the scale of St Mirren's cup final win against Celtic.",
    "fullText": "URC: Glasgow Warriors v Edinburgh\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Saturday, 20 December Time: 15:00 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live text on BBC Sport website & app\n\nIt's less than a week since Hampden Park witnessed its last shock when St Mirren beat Celtic in the Premier Sports Cup final. If Edinburgh turn over high-flying Glasgow Warriors at the national stadium on Saturday, it would be similarly surprising.\n\nWarriors are riding high after a thrilling and stunning victory over six-time European champions Toulouse in the Champions Cup, rising from the ashes of a 21-0 deficit to deliver a win that sent reverberations around Europe.\n\nEdinburgh, by contrast, are reeling from a 33-0 thrashing at the hands of Castres. A seismic win at home to French heavyweights Toulon the week before confirmed what we already know: that at their best Edinburgh can be a match for anyone. But they remain consistently, and maddeningly, inconsistent.\n\nThe tale of recent 1872 Cup meetings has been victory for the home side. Since adopting a two-leg format in 2021, seven of the past eight matches between Glasgow and Edinburgh have resulted in home victories. Edinburgh have not delivered an 1872 Cup victory along the M8 since 2020.\n\nWarriors have won the trophy in the past three consecutive seasons, but in the most recent two they have had the bittersweet feeling of lifting the trophy having been turned over in the second leg at Murrayfield.\n\n\"It's been difficult for us over the last couple of years because we've gone through this cycle of hammering Edinburgh in the first game, we're all over them, and then the second game we lose,\" Warriors' Ollie Smith told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"We still retain the 1872 Cup, but I think it just shows the kind of standards that we set ourselves at the start of the season to be like, we're not just happy to retain the 1872 Cup, we want to win both games.\n\n\"It's getting our emotions right in those massive occasions and putting a performance that we know we can be proud of.\n\n\"If they beat us then they have to beat us by being perfect because, and there's no disrespect to Edinburgh, but it feels like we've almost let them win because we've not been at it. But this year, the focus is for us to be spot on and make them beat us rather than giving it to them.\"\n\nCummings eyes silverware as he signs new Glasgow deal\n\nHow loss of brother shaped Smith's rugby journey\n\nEdinburgh's memories of their first visit to Hampden last season are ones they would rather forget. They were obliterated by Glasgow, falling 33-0 down before grabbing a couple of late consolation tries to take a slight edge off the embarrassing scoreline.\n\nSean Everitt's side are specialists at bouncing back from bad defeats, mainly because they have had so much practice at it. Edinburgh fans would love if, for once, their team were not made to suffer before producing a reaction, but rather came out at Hampden on the front foot.\n\nOne of the capital side's breakout stars this season, back-row Liam McConnell, believes that in Glasgow his team face not only their local rivals, but one of the best sides around. It is among the reasons he is relishing the tussle between the sides.\n\n\"I've never played in one,\" said the 21-year-old. \"I've been at the club for the last couple of seasons now and been around it when it's the 1872 Cup weeks. It's always special.\n\n\"The guys in the matchday squad have a different intensity around them, so to be part of it is pretty cool. Everyone's real focused for Saturday, you can tell.\n\n\"It'll be good. Glasgow are in good form right now, probably one of the best club teams in the world, you could say.\n\n\"It's not only 1872, we're playing one of the best club teams in the world at the moment, so that's a challenge in itself. I'm really excited.\"\n\nAll the feelgood factor and momentum generated from that famous win over Toulon was dynamited by Edinburgh fielding a weakened team and going down meekly to Castres.\n\nIt's a familiar narrative heading into the derby – Glasgow being showered with praise, Edinburgh being bombarded with questions and criticism.\n\nThe best way to change that would be to give Warriors a bloody nose in front of their own people on Saturday.\n\n\"There's no-one better to beat, is there?\" said Edinburgh hooker Ewan Ashman.\n\n\"We know they're a quality team and those are the games you want to play. Glasgow are a good side and that was a good win [against Toulouse].\n\n\"We've done similar a couple of weeks ago against Toulon, so we know the feeling. They'll be riding super high and they'll be coming in with confidence.\n\n\"It's the exact kind of challenge we're looking to take head-on. We need to show that fighting spirit.\"",

    "fullText": "Heading into Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors were riding a two-game losing streak. In each game, the Warriors held a lead in the fourth quarter, but struggled down the stretch on the way to losses.\n\nOn Thursday against the Phoenix Suns, the Warriors failed to close again, despite a heroic performance from Jimmy Butler. Behind Butler, the Warriors built a seven-point lead at halftime, yet heading into the fourth quarter, their lead dwindled down to one.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Suns took control as momentum swung their way. Yet, Butler, Steph Curry and the Warriors wouldn't go away. In the final minute, the Suns led by five points before Dillon Brooks committed a flagrant foul on Curry, sending him to the line for a pair of free throws. After the free throws from Curry, Butler knocked down a clutch 3-pointer to tie the game at 96. After Booker and Curry traded buckets to tie the game again at 98, Moses Moody committed a late foul on Jordan Goodwin in the final second of the game. Goodwin missed the first attempt from the line before hitting the game-winning free throw and dealt the Warriors their third straight loss, 99-98.\n\nButler finished with a game-high 31 points on 11-of-17 shooting from the field with three assists and three rebounds in 34 minutes. Butler's performance on Thursday night in Phoenix was his third game of the season scoring 30 or more points. Thursday also marked his highest scoring mark in a month.\n\nAlongside Butler, Brandin Podziemski put together a strong performance on Thursday, scoring 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting from the field with a pair of made 3-pointers in 28 minutes off the bench.\n\nWhile Podziemski and Butler helped fuel Golden State's offense, Steph Curry struggled, scoring 15 points on 3-of-13 shooting from the field and 2-of-9 from deep. Butler, Podziemski and Curry were the only members of the Warriors to tally double-figure scoring numbers. Draymond Green committed five of Golden State's 20 turnovers.\n\nAfter their third straight loss, the Warriors have fallen to 13-15 on the season. The Warriors will get the chance to avenge their loss from Thursday when the Suns travel back to the Bay Area on Saturday for a rematch at Chase Center.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Late free throws from Suns helps deal Warriors' third straight loss",

The Warriors will be missing veteran big man Al Horford and guard Pat Spencer on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nHorford has been missing time with a sciatica injury. Horford has missed seven of the last eight games, including four straight. Thursday night will be his fifth straight missed game. ESPN's Nick Friedell reports that Horford is still around another week away from returning from to the court as he continues to rehab from his sciatica injury.\n\nHorford said he is feeling better in his rehab — but he thinks he’s probably another week away from returning as he continues to deal with a sciatica issue.\n\n— Nick Friedell (@NickFriedell) December 18, 2025\n\nHorford has played 13 games in his first season for the Warriors, averaging 5.6 points on 32.1% shooting from the field and 29.8% from deep to go along with 4.4 rebounds per contest.\n\nWhile Horford is out on Thursday with his sciatica injury, Spencer is ruled out against the Suns for personal reasons. With Spencer and Horford out, Steve Kerr will have to lean on Golden State's depth, with players like Quinten Post, Brandin Podziemski, De'Anthony Melton and Gary Payton II potentially seeing a bigger role on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nThe Warriors will tip off against the Suns at 6 p.m. PT on Thursday night in the desert.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Injury Report: Al Horford, Pat Spencer out vs. Suns",

    "description": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea from Steve Kerr about gun control.",
    "fullText": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea for gun control from Steve Kerr.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors coach spoke for about three minutes unprompted on Sunday night before their 136-131 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers and again called for gun reform in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University.\n\n“With what happened last night at Brown, it’s just a reminder to me that these shootings continue to happen, and there is something we can do about them. The loss that all of the people involved [Saturday] night, the loss that they’re feeling, it’s exactly the same loss as all the Parkland families, and every other mass shooting.\n\n“Nobody asked me about it today. I didn’t expect anybody to ask me. I doubt we’re gonna do a moment of silence out there because it’s human nature just to not want to deal with this stuff. And it’s human nature just to think, ‘This is so horrible. Let’s not even think about it.’ But we have to think about it.”\n\nSpeaking pregame, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr addresses gun violence following this weekend’s shooting at Brown University.\n\n“We know there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. … I just want people thinking ‘What if it were my child?’”\n\nMore: pic.twitter.com/E2n9z62jYZ\n\n— Sam Gordon (@BySamGordon) December 15, 2025\n\nA shooting took place at Brown University in Rhode Island on Saturday afternoon that left two people dead and nine others injured, according to The New York Times. An investigation is still ongoing. Authorities released a man who they had detained on Sunday night, and are still searching for the alleged gunman.\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, that was the 389th mass shootings in the United States so far this year. There have been others since.\n\nGun control is something that Kerr has been a strong advocate of for years. He’s spoken out about plenty of other mass shootings in the United States in the past, hosted a town hall about the issue, drawn support for groups founded by students who survived other mass shootings, and more. Kerr’s father, Malcolm, was shot and killed during a terrorist attack in Beirut in 1984 when Steve was a student at Arizona.\n\n“The vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Kerr said. “They have every right to own a gun. But it’s on us to decide if we actually want to take action as a country, as citizens. We know, we know that there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. And I just want people out there — it doesn’t matter if you’re Democrat or Republican, or gun owner, non-gun owner — I just want people thinking, ‘What if it were my child? What if it were my brother or sister?’ Would you be willing to stand up to your representatives and say, ‘You know what? Enough. I’m not gonna vote for you unless you are going to stand up for gun violence prevention through common-sense laws that the vast majority of Americans agree on.'\n\n“Or are we just gonna continue to let the gun lobby run us over and not do anything to protect each other, to protect our children, to protect our future. We have to make that decision.”\n\nKerr wasn't alone in the sports world, either. USC women's basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb, who played at Brown, spoke out on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's the guns,\" she said after the Trojans' loss to No. 1 UConn. \"We're the only country that lives this way.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time that Kerr has addressed this issue, and mass shootings continue to occur in the United States. Based on recent history, it likely won't be the last time we hear from Kerr about gun control, either.\n\nWhile Kerr knows how easy it would be to just give up and ignore the problem, especially since it seems like nothing is getting better, he ended his plea on Sunday night with a simple solution.\n\n“Don’t just look the other way, even though that’s human nature and I understand it,” Kerr said. “Think about it. Think about, do you want something done? Do you want your child to go to school terrified every day? Or do you want to actually take action?\n\n“Because that’s what a democracy is about. Where we demand that our representatives protect us. And that option is there. So, we can either just do what we’re continuing to do and let these things happen or make some demands. And so, as you’re thinking about this today, think about, what if it were your own family member?”",

Glasgow needed something to offer a glimmer of hope and they got it when some slick handling set McKay free up the touchline to run in for the try.\n\nWhether it was some strong words at half-time from head coach Franco Smith, or turning around to play with the wind now at their backs, a flick had switched and suddenly Warriors were putting it up to their illustrious opponents.\n\nThe Glasgow bench was making an impact and one of the substitutes, Brown, blasted over from close range to reduce the arrears to seven points and bring Scotstoun to life.\n\nThe roof nearly came off the place when Tuipulotu finished off an a period of intense pressure on the Toulouse line, and when Adam Hastings banged over the conversion we were all square.\n\nStill Glasgow came. They had Toulouse rocking and they landed another blow, a rolling line-out maul thundering over the try-line with substitute Hiddleston touching down to give Warriors the lead for the first time.\n\nThe great teams often find their way out a hole, but on this particular night, the Toulouse Galacticos had the fight knocked out of them by an inspired Glasgow Warriors side on a beautifully bonkers evening at Scotstoun that will live long in the memory.\n\nGlasgow: McKay; Steyn, McDowall, Tuipulotu, Smith; Hastings, Dobie; McBeth, Hiddleston, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, M Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey.\n\nReplacements: Stephen, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Brown, Miller, Horne, Lancaster.\n\nToulouse: Ramos; Capuozzo, Costes, Gourgues, Kinghorn; Ntamack, Dupont; Ainuu, Marchand, Aldegheri, Brennan, Flament, Willis, Banos, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Lacombre, Neti, Merkler, Meafou, Castro Ferreira, Roumat, Graou, Thomas.",
