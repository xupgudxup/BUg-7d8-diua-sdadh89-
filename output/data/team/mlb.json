    "fullText": "1922 \nBlack Sox member Buck Weaver petitioned for reinstatement into baseball. The former White Sox third baseman was one of eight players banned for life due to his involvement in throwing the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nThough Weaver was the most innocent of the Black Sox, he did attend at least two meetings in which the specifics of throwing the Series were discussed. It went uncontested that Weaver took no money from gamblers and played at his full potential for the entire Series.\n\nHowever, Judge Landis did not yield, turning down Weaver’s application.\n\n1927 \nTo make room for the up-and-coming Tony Lazzeri, the Yankees sent second baseman Aaron Ward to Chicago for catcher Johnny Grabowski and second baseman Ray Moreheart.\n\nWhile Ward played just one year for the White Sox — at 30, his final full year in the bigs — the South Siders got the better end of this deal. Ward put up a .270/.360/.391 as a regular, good for a 96 OPS+ and 2.1 WAR. Moreheart played in 73 games with a .681 OPS and 0.7 WAR, while Grabowski would have a -1.1 WAR in 167 games over the next three years in the Bronx.\n\nOn the other hand, Grabowski and Moreheart both got to play on one of the best teams in MLB history, the Murderer’s Row Yankees who went 110-44-1 and swept the Pirates in the 1927 World Series.\n\n1991 \nIt’s not often you’ll see an NFL item in our daily history, but this one has resonance.\n\nIn a playoff game for the Oakland Raiders vs. the Cincinnati Bengals, running back Bo Jackson suffered a season-ending, and career-threatening, leg injury. Initially said to be a pulled thigh muscle, Jackson’s setback is much more significant, necessitating surgery — and eventually, a hip replacement.\n\nWhen Bo’s baseball club at the time (he was a two-sport player), the Kansas City Royals, learned of the severity of his injury, he was released. Two weeks later, the White Sox snatched him up, believing in Jackson’s determination to rehab his injury and stage a baseball comeback. The outfielder sat out the entire 1992 season before making his return to the field — with an artificial hip — on April 9, 1993.\n\nHis first at-bat resulted in a pinch-hit home run.\n\n1995 \nBaseball’s executive council voted to allow replacement players in upcoming Spring Training and regular season games, given the ongoing labor impasse with the MLBPA. The more prominent scabs who briefly would become White Sox were shortstop Kent Anderson, outfielder Shawn Buchanan, starting pitcher Oil Can Boyd, outfielder Al Chambers, reliever John Davis, catcher Bill Lindsey, catcher Junior Ortiz and third baseman Pete Rose Jr.\n\nRecall that this is the decision that would eventually drive aspiring major-leaguer Michael Jordan from his baseball career.\n\n2020 \nPunishments were handed down to the Astros as a result of their trash can scandal, which allowed Houston to cheat its way to a World Series title in 2017. While NO players were punished, GM Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch were suspended for a season (and subsequently fired by the Astros). Houston also had to pay a $5 million fine and lose its twp two picks in the 2020 and 2021 drafts.\n\nWhy is this a White Sox item? Because Chicago reliever Danny Farquhar, during a September 2017 game in Houston, heard the trash can and unearthed the scandal, calling catcher Kevan Smith out to change the signs and foil the plot. The story didn’t break because no one picked up on what happened; Farquhar admitted later that he was sitting at his locker postgame just waiting to tell his story … but no one asked.",

    "fullText": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow the various narrative paths.\n\n“Maybe I called it wrong, but it’s official.” — Tom Connolly, HoF Umpire.\n\nHappy birthday to Bill Madlock*,  it’s drafty in here, and other stories for the discerning reader,\n\n1887 – The New York Metropolitans (American Association) buy third baseman Dude Esterbrook from the New York Giants (NL). Although the Mets are no longer owned by the Giants’ management, the Giants still seem to get the best of every deal between the two clubs. (2)\n\n1900 – Baltimore Orioles manager John McGraw threatens that if the National League drops the Orioles, which are controlled by the owners of the Brooklyn Superbas, he will form an American League team. Two weeks later the NL Circuit Committee recommends buying out Baltimore, Washington, Cleveland, and Louisville and going to an eight-team league. McGraw then organizes a Baltimore club in the AL, which is still a minor league circuit at this point, albeit one with bigger ambitions. (2)\n\n1920 – A plan developed by Charles Ebbets many years ago is finally adopted: the annual drafting of players from the minor leagues will be done in inverse order of the final standings. (1,2)\n\n1921 – Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis takes over his new role as Commissioner of baseball. Landis, who is given wide-ranging powers, replaces the three-man National Commission that had been running the game for nearly two decades. (2)\n\n1950 – The New York Yankees sell their Newark Bears franchise to the Chicago Cubs, who will move the team to Springfield, Massachusetts. The once-proud Bears, owned by the Yankees since 1932, finished last in the International League in 1949. (2)\n\n1961 – Charlie Grimm and Verlon Walker are named to the Chicago Cubs College of Coaches. Using this system, a different coach will manage the team each month during the season, and members of the group will move between the major league team and its minor league affiliates. (2)\n\n1982 – In the January draft, the Blue Jays use the #1 pick on OF Kash Beauchamp and the Cubs follow by taking C Troy Afenir. But the Twins, picking third, strike gold when they take OF Kirby Puckett. Meanwhile, the Reds choose P Randy Myers in the first round while the Mets select OF Kal Daniels in the third round. The 433rd pick overall is OF John Cangelosi, taken by the White Sox. (2)\n\n2018 – The Blue Jays sign 3B Josh Donaldson to one-year deal worth $23 million. It is the largest salary ever given to a player eligible for salary arbitration, besting the $21.6 million given to Bryce Harper by the Nationals last May. Donaldson’s is not the only record-setting deal signed today: the Cubs offer 3B Kris Bryant $10.85 million, the most ever for a player eligible for arbitration for the first time. (2)\n\nCubs Birthdays: George Browne, Roy Easterwood, Phil Mudrock, Paul Reuschel, Bill Madlock*,\n\n475 – Basiliscus becomes Byzantine Emperor, with a coronation ceremony in the Hebdomon palace in Constantinople.\n\n1554 – Bayinnaung is crowned King of Burma, assembles the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia.\n\n1812 – First cargo arrives in New Orleans by steamboat from Natchez.\n\n1906 – First time Dow Jones Industrial Average closes above 100 (100.26).\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nSome of these items spread from site to site without being fact-checked, and that is why we ask for verifiable sources, in order to help correct the record.",

    "fullText": "We’re not all that far off now from spring training. Just one month remains until pitchers and catchers report to camp. But this MLB offseason feels anything but complete.\n\nPlenty of top-tier free agents have yet to sign anywhere. Of MLB Trade Rumors’ top 10 ranked FAs, half of them remain on the market: Kyle Tucker (#1), Bo Bichette (#2), Framber Valdez (#6), Cody Bellinger (#8), and Ranger Suárez (#10). And #5 on that list, Alex Bregman, just joined the Cubs two days ago.\n\nThere’s a lot of great talent still available for whichever teams are willing to pay for it. Orioles fans, of course, are hoping that Baltimore is one of those teams. Valdez or Suárez, the two pitchers on that list, are the most sensible fits for the Birds. But hey, why stop there? I’ve been beating the Kyle Tucker drum this offseason and I’m not going to stop now, even though the O’s acquired Taylor Ward earlier this winter. I say if you have the financial wherewithal to add a premium free agent — which the Orioles do, if the Pete Alonso signing is any indication — then you might as well be in discussions with all the top guys, even if they’re not an obvious fit on the roster. Sign Tucker to play right field, and you could have Dylan Beavers back up at all three outfield positions. I’m not particularly concerned about what would happen to Tyler O’Neill in that scenario.\n\nHeck, sign Bo Bichette to play second base. You could move Jackson Holliday to, I don’t know, center field? Or go ahead and swipe Cody Bellinger out from under the Yankees’ noses. He’s not the defensive center fielder he once was, but I’d probably trust him more than Colton Cowser out there, and he’s certainly a better hitter.\n\nMaybe I’m only being half-serious with these suggestions. The O’s don’t have unlimited cash and would probably prefer to stick to the more realistic options. But can anyone say they’d truly be upset if the O’s came out of nowhere and landed someone like Tucker, Bichette, or Bellinger, in addition to one of the pitchers? What an offseason that would be.\n\nSo go ahead, Orioles. You’ve got a month left to do something truly awesome. Let’s have some fun, shall we?\n\nCan Bradfield be Orioles’ Opening Day centerfielder? | MAILBAG – BaltimoreBaseball.com\n\nThis mailbag question comes from someone who did not follow Bradfield’s 2025 season, I suppose. Rich Dubroff rightly responds that there’s no chance of it happening.\n\nAs solid offseason winds down, is there pressure on O’s to add one more starter? – Steve Melewski\n\nDepends what you mean by “pressure.” I don’t think Elias will be fired or anything if he doesn’t add another starter. But I hope he’s prepared for Orioles fans to angrily voice their displeasure on the internet. Take that, Mike!\n\nThis, that and the other – School of Roch\n\nGunnar Henderson is hyped about the World Baseball Classic. You and me both, Gunnar.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! Six former Orioles were born on this day, including (Na Na Na-Na-Na) Kim! Hyun! Soo!, who turns 38. After his brief MLB stint with the Birds from 2016-17, Kim is still going strong in the Korea Baseball Organization, spending the past eight years with the LG Twins. Other ex-O’s celebrating Jan. 12 birthdays are right-handers Chris Ray (44) and Luis Ayala (48), infielders Tim Hulett (66) and Juan Bonilla (70), and lefty Paul Gilliford (81).\n\nOn this date in 2007, the Orioles traded righty Rodrigo López to the Rockies for two prospects. López had been a solid starter for the O’s for five seasons, averaging more than 180 innings per year and thrice serving as the Opening Day starter. He was the AL Rookie of the Year runner-up in 2002. In his last season with the Birds, though, López led the league in both losses (18) and earned runs allowed (124).",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Diamondbacks will not trade second baseman Ketel Marte, general manager Mike Hazen said on Friday, Jan. 9, bringing an end to months of discussions about a possible deal.\n\nThe club had explored the possibility of a trade in the hopes of bringing back younger, cheaper players. A deal also would have shed payroll that could have then been reallocated.\n\nHazen has said over the past month that he did not want the talks to drag much beyond the start of the year. He wanted to turn his focus to finding other ways to upgrade his roster.\n\nThe Diamondbacks seemed interested in making a deal happen if the right one presented itself. Apparently, one never did.\n\nOne possible reason was that the club was said to have had a high asking price that rival clubs were reluctant to reach. Teams also might have preferred to take their chances on the free-agent market, which still features several unsigned star position players.\n\nAnother possibility is that clubs were concerned about Marte’s makeup and fit in a new clubhouse, particularly after he upset teammates by missing games after the All-Star break last year following a break-in at his Scottsdale home, an incident for which he later apologized.\n\nKeeping Marte, of course, is far from a bad outcome for the Diamondbacks. He has been the best second baseman in the majors over the past few seasons, accumulating 16 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), per Baseball-Reference, the most at the position.\n\nIt could, however, make it more difficult for the club to shore up its pitching staff.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have rounded out their rotation this winter by bringing back free-agent Merrill Kelly and signing veteran Michael Soroka, but the bullpen, a major trouble spot in recent seasons, remains unchanged and in need of upgrades.\n\nHazen has said he remains engaged in the free-agent and trade markets in search of bullpen help.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Ketel Marte trade won't happen despite rumors, Diamondbacks GM says",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States. At the news conference, MLB staff assembled duffel bags with goods for foster care children.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

As pointed out by attorney Josh Gerben on his blog, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied multiple requests from the team, including for “Las Vegas Athletics” and “Vegas Athletics.” The trademarks were denied due to the names being deemed too generic.\n\nAccording to the USPTO, the dominant portion of each mark refers to a well-known geographic location (Las Vegas) while the remaining wording, ‘Athletics,’ lacks distinctiveness as applied to the goods and services identified in the applications.\n\nThe examining attorney noted that “athletics” is defined as “activities such as sports, exercises, and games that require physical skill and stamina,” and concluded that the term directly describes “the purpose and feature of the applicant’s goods and services.” As a result, the USPTO found that the marks merely describe a professional sports team located in Las Vegas rather than functioning as unique indicators of source.\n\nIn an effort to persuade the USPTO, the team pointed to decades of using the name “Athletics” throughout its history. The office, however, stood firm in its ruling.\n\nGerben added that he believes the Athletics will ultimately secure the trademark, noting that such an issue is rarely seen among professional sports teams.\n\nThe post The A’s Just Hit a Massive Speed Bump on Their Move to Las Vegas first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The Cincinnati Reds should not trade their starting catcher Tyler Stephenson.",
    "fullText": "As the Cincinnati Reds weigh their options heading into the 2026 season, one of the more debated topics has been whether the team should consider moving catcher Tyler Stephenson. While the Reds are operating on a limited payroll and have another capable catcher on the roster, trading Stephenson would be a mistake for several reasons.\n\nFirst, his backup, Jose Trevino, is best suited for a defensive role rather than as a full-time starter. Trevino has earned both a Gold Glove and a Platinum Glove Award, proving his value behind the plate, but his bat remains a liability. He is most effective as a defensive replacement or in spot starts, not as the everyday catcher. That reality underscores Stephenson’s importance, as he provides offensive production that is rare to find at the position.\n\nStephenson’s versatility also adds value. Beyond catching, he has the ability to play first base, giving manager Terry Francona flexibility in constructing lineups. For a team trying to maximize resources, having a player who can fill multiple roles is critical. Trading him simply to address other areas of the roster would weaken the team’s depth and reduce options in the infield.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Stephenson’s trade value is not at its peak. He is coming off a down year for his standards in which he hit .231 with a .316 on-base percentage, .737 OPS, 13 home runs and 50 RBIs. Moving him now would mean selling low, rather than waiting for him to rebound to the level he showed in 2024, when he was a key offensive piece.\n\nStephenson will be entering his seventh year with the Reds after being drafted 11th overall in the 2015 MLB Draft. His connection to the organization and fanbase adds intangible value that cannot be overlooked. As a homegrown player who has delivered memorable moments, he embodies the team’s identity and helps drive fan engagement, which is vital for a franchise looking to sustain momentum and build its culture.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, keeping Stephenson allows the Reds to develop younger catchers at a natural pace. He can serve as a bridge until a long-term successor is ready, rather than forcing a premature transition. His combination of above-average offense for his position, defensive leadership and clubhouse stability makes a compelling case for Cincinnati to hold onto him.\n\nTrading Stephenson might seem like a quick fix, but in reality, the Reds are better positioned to contend by keeping him in the fold.",

The longer Boston waits, the more likely it becomes that another team will swoop in and sign him.\n\nThe Red Sox may not be the frontrunner for Bregman anymore, either, based on Mark Feinsand’s report for MLB.com on Thursday. According to Feinsand, the Arizona Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays “may be the two most aggressive clubs in the hunt for Bregman,” although a reunion with Boston is still possible.\n\nWhere things stand with top 6 @MLB free agents https://t.co/ta8jzvhgDX\n\n— Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) January 2, 2026\n\nFeinsand adds that the Red Sox and Blue Jays are both competing for Bichette as well. Accordingly, the free-agent decisions of Bregman and Bichette are closely related.\n\nIf Bregman returns to Boston, Toronto becomes more likely to re-sign Bichette and vice versa. If Bregman joins the Blue Jays, the Red Sox may counter by signing Bichette.\n\nBoston can be flexible thanks to Marcelo Mayer’s defensive versatility. If Bregman leaves, the Red Sox could put him at third base and sign Bichette to play second base. If Bregman stays, Mayer can man second.\n\nIt depends on which of the two All-Stars signs first, and where. Regardless, it sounds like there’s a high likelihood of them either returning to their teams or switching teams with each other, the latter of which would make things even more interesting in the AL East.\n\nRed Sox Fans Get Concerning Update In Alex Bregman Sweepstakes",

Now, MLB.com’s analyst Jared Greenspan and Theo DeRosa linked the Red Sox to Eugenio Suarez if the team can’t land either Bregman or Bichette.\n\n“Boston could still use another impact bat,” the two wrote in an article published on Thursday. “Among the top remaining free-agent hitters, shortstop Bo Bichette and outfielders Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger aren’t the most natural fits for the Red Sox.\n\n“But re-signing third baseman Alex Bregman would be an obvious move. If Bregman signs elsewhere, slugger Eugenio Suarez could be a fallback option.”\n\nSuarez would be an impact bat for Boston and could play third base and hit in the middle of the order. The slugger split last season between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Seattle Mariners, and he hit 49 home runs with 118 RBIs. The 49 home runs tied his career-high back in 2019.\n\nThe Red Sox have also been linked to Ketel Marte in trade talks, but it’s uncertain if the Diamondbacks will move him.\n\nRegardless of who it ends up being, adding a bat is likely the priority for the Red Sox after shoring up their pitching staff this offseason.\n\nSo far this offseason, Boston has acquired first baseman Willson Contreras and pitchers Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo in three separate trades.\n\nRed Sox Fans Shouldn’t Forget About These Two Vital Extensions",

    "fullText": "MLB.com | Brian Murphy: Tatsuya Imai, the top NPB player on the free agent market, is reportedly meeting with teams in Los Angeles ahead of his Friday afternoon deadline to sign. It’s unclear whether the Yankees are among those teams meeting in-person with Imai, though reports still link them, along with the Phillies and White Sox, to the right-hander. Imai, just 27-years-old, posted a 1.92 ERA over 163.2 innings in NPB last season, and may command a nine-figure guarantee.\n\nNew York Daily News | Peter Sblendorio: Now that the first quarter of the 21st century is in the books, the Daily News picked their All-Century New York team, selecting the best player from the last 25 years for each of New York’s teams. The top Yankee? None other than Aaron Judge. Judge had to beat out Derek Jeter, who won two World Series and racked up over 2,600 hits in the 2000’s, Alex Rodriguez, who won two MVP’s as a Yankee in the 21st century, and many other greats, but it’s clear that Judge’s resume has no peer. There are some debates with the other NY teams as well; Jalen Brunson, who’s played just 3.5 seasons in New York, is the Knicks’ All-Century selection, while Michael Strahan gets the nod over Eli Manning for the Giants.\n\nMLB.com | Sarah Langs: To close out 2025, the great Sarah Langs highlighted at least one amazing stat for each team from last season. For the Yankees, it of course came from Aaron Judge. Judge led MLB in batting average, OBP, and slugging percentage, the triple-slash triple crown, becoming just the fifth man in the expansion era to do so. He also set a record with 20 first-inning home runs.",

    "fullText": "MLB’s history of steroid use continues to provoke controversy as a discussion related to Hall of Fame candidacy. The juiciest debates of all concern all-time great talents who have been kept out of the Hall due to their evidence-based connection to steroids.\n\nFormer Boston Red Sox greats Manny Ramirez and Roger Clemens are two examples of such players who have been kept out of the HOF due to their link to performance-enhancing substances.\n\nMeanwhile, more nuanced discussions on the topic in recent years have pointed out that there are multiple guys already in the Hall who have been linked to steroids, if not officially condemned with evidence.\n\nESPN’s astute MLB analyst Paul Hembekides explained where his line is drawn (during a recent podcast), and it makes a lot of sense.\n\nFor Hembekides, if you were an MLB player caught using performance enhancement drugs after mandatory testing was implemented in 2004, you don’t deserve Hall of Fame entry. However, by that same token, Hembekides doesn’t believe that players like Clemens who used steroids during the height of usage (and prior to testing) should be banned from the Hall.\n\nMajor League Baseball was a testing-free league from 1986 until 2004.\n\nHolding Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens to the same standard as players in the testing era is intellectually dishonest. pic.twitter.com/XNrXMkBtpo\n\n— Paul Hembekides (Hembo) (@PaulHembo) December 29, 2025\n\n“These are complicated decisions that writers and that voters need to make, (and) I’ve kind of made my piece with the fact that if you’ve tested positive, or we have clear reason to believe that you did (use) steroids after the testing was in place, then you’re out for me,” Hembekides said.\n\n“So count me out on Manny (Ramirez) and count me out on A-Rod,” Hembekides continued. “But Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, best we can tell, started using steroids at the peak of the steroid era, and the biggest mistake that they made was being so much greater than their peers.”\n\nSteroids were first banned in MLB in 1991 when commissioner Fay Vincent issued a memo, but there was no testing established. In 2003, MLB and the players’ union agreed to anonymous testing to gauge the prevalence of steroid usage. When more than five percent of these tests came back positive, MLB made a move to implement mandatory testing (with penalties), which began in 2004. This is the line in the sand referred to by Hembekides.\n\nIn 2013, MLB started testing for human growth hormone using blood samples.\n\nRed Sox’s Marcelo Mayer Makes Notable Jersey Number Change",

With the Angels last season, Moncada hit .234 with 12 home runs and 35 RBIs.\n\nIf the Pirates sign Moncada, he would join an infield that features Jared Triolo at third base, Nick Gonzalez at shortstop, newly-acquired Brandon Lowe at shortstop, and Spencer Horwitz at first base.\n\nMore Pirates: Aggressive Pirates Having Sensational Offseason Thus Far\n\nThe post Pirates Reportedly One Of Four Teams Interested In Intriguing Free Agent Infielder appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "Chaim Bloom has made it a priority this offseason to strengthen the team’s pitching staff and depth as a primary goal. After trading veteran starting pitcher Sonny Gray to the Boston Red Sox before Thanksgiving and returning MLB-ready Richard Fitts and minor league upside starter Brandon Clarke, as well as the recent trade of First Basemen Willson Contreras, also to Boston, for Hunter Dobbins, Yhoiker Fajardo, and Blake Aita the front office continues to pursue pitching through trades and free agency. Even if all of the arms acquired this offseason don’t reach the major leagues thats okay because young controllable pitching is the single most sought-after commodity, and the surplus can be used to acquire and upgrade other areas of the roster that may be lacking when the time comes to compete once more. Other names on the block include Brendan Donovan, JoJo Romero, Lars Nootbaar, and Nolan Arenado.\n\nAfter trading away Ryan Helsley, Phil Maton, and Steven Matz at the deadline, non-tendering John King, and all but expecting JoJo Romero to be pitching elsewhere in 2026. Chaim Bloom has publicly spoken about a desire to have a veteran presence in the bullpen to help the young relievers mature as everyday big leaguers. From the outside, they view their pitch to prospective free agents as pointing towards Andrew Kittredge and Phil Maton and point out that if you come to St. Louis for a year, you can re-establish yourself to earn a larger payday where there are innings and opportunity aplenty! If/when JoJo Romero is traded away, the team will only have fringe 40-man arm Nick Raquet from the left side on the 40-man roster. The Cardinals could consider multiple left-handed options if that indeed comes to fruition.\n\nChaim Bloom has staunchly been against promoting players before they are fully ready to move up, which is why I don’t view Quinn Matthews, Brycen Mautz, Pete Hansen, Ixan Henderson, Liam Doyle, etc., as options for the bullpen at the beginning of the 2026 season. Matthews is still trying to master AAA, and none of the other four have even competed in Triple-A, so they don’t know how their stuff will perform with a new variable added to their situation, like pitching with the big league ball.\n\nWhen trying to scope out who could be a potential target or fit, we can look for clues in the profile of arms the team has already acquired under the new leadership’s guided focus. Going back to this year’s draft selecting Liam Doyle and Tanner Franklin, the trade deadline in acquiring Nate Dohm and Frank Ellisalt, the trade for Richard Fitts and Brandon Clarke, or even their Rule 5 selection in Matt Pushard. High octane fastball’s appear to be the vogue guiding light for their player development group. Of course, I always bring names to the table. I would never leave you, the reader, without something to chew on or consider, so here are three names from the left side and the right side who bring one of a big fastball, veteran leadership/experience, or a combination of the two!\n\n2025 – 39 G 4.63 ERA 4.25 FIP 3.86 xFIP 32 K 35 IP\n\nBorucki will remind some fans of JoJo Romero as he throws his Slider 41% of the time as his primary pitch and produced a whiff% of 37.7. Overall, he had a .117/.229/.150 with a .188 wOBA against 70 LHB last season. His Sinker sits in the 93-94 range, which is plenty hard enough when batters are trying to decipher between that and an 85 MPH sweeping slider. The 10 MPH of separation between speeds works well to keep hitters off balance and produce some pretty ugly swings and misses. Borucki is probably one of the best available left-handers who offers the combination of stuff, performance, and experience left available on the open market.\n\n2025 – 19 G 8.31 ERA 5.77 FIP 5.18 xFIP 21 K 21.2 IP\n\nFor a pitcher with as much octane as Perez has, he strangely generates a whiff rate below 25%, which is just a little below league average. Perez IS however, a soft contact merchant. His Barrel rate of 2.9% and groundball rate of 60.9 % would both rank in the 99th percentile if he had a qualified number of innings pitched last season. The 16.4 BB% is the real kicker with Cionel, and I don’t know how you remedy that in my limited understanding of pitching mechanics, but perhaps the Cardinals would. Sitting at 95.6 MPH on average from his fastball, he certainly fits the “throws gas” north star the front office has established. .265/.390/.324 .331 wOBA against 43 LHB last season, you can clearly tell that the walks were what bit him. The .324 SLG is more than good enough if Perez can keep the ball in the zone. Busch will keep the ball in the park, and perhaps the Cardinals could catch lightning in a bottle as Perez would be a sought-after commodity with an additional year of club control accruing just over 4 years of service time so far at the deadline if the Cardinals can hone him in.\n\n2025 – 48 G 4.52 ERA 4.57 FIP 4.30 xFIP 53 K 67.2 IP\n\nI talked about Suter at the beginning of the offseason, and I believe his existence on the roster would still add a lot of value. Suter is a Harvard grad and can pitch multiple innings in relief; he can serve as an opener, and he would allow Manager Oli Marmol more flexibility with his bullpen usage. He’s one of the quickest workers in the big leagues, and that matters on 100-degree St. Louis days to keep players from baking in the sun. Suter would also fit PERFECTLY as the bullpen mentor as a reigning Clemente Award nominee. Those are all the “glue” reasons why Suter would fit. His under-the-hood metrics would make him almost the antithesis of our “North Star type.” But, while his average fastball velocity is in the 1st percentile at 87.9, his extension of 7.5 ft put him in the 99th percentile, which, as we know, increases perceived velocity and makes pitches appear to come out faster than they are because theyre being released so much closer than hitters are used to. His average exit velo against is 99th percentile at 85.8 mph, his BB% is low at 6.2%, his hard hit rate is 96th percentile at 32.9%, and he generates groundballs at a 45.4% clip. 18.2 K% is below average but not non-existent, as he’s a veteran who knows how to pitch and can get a strikeout when he needs one. There isn’t a whole lot of upside to be had in this profile, but when you value a Swiss Army knife type pitcher who can pitch in a variety of roles and situations thats valuable to a team with a young staff to help navigate and get through a full 162.\n\n2025 – 65 G 5.30 ERA 4.40 FIP 4.98 xFIP 58 K 56 IP\n\nImagine the flexibility that a roster that contained both Brent Suter and Ryne Stanek would provide! Stanek is a little bit like Cionel Perez in that his inability to throw strikes consistently in 2025 is what really hurt his overall numbers. Stanek can really step on the gas pedal with his average fastball velocity at 98.5 MPH, which had him in the 96th percentile. The 12.5 BB% doesn’t help things, and he’s a flyball pitcher – that CAN work, pitching your home games at Busch. Chaim had Stanek in Tampa Bay and knows just what he’s capable of, having experience pitching in a multitude of roles from opening to closing. Think of Ryan Helsley with Stanek. The fastball is hard but straight, but the slider is the true equalizer, generating an over 45% whiff rate! The numbers Stanek posted last season won’t get him big money this offseason, but he sure provides his next team a lot of tools to work with that could get the most out of him in 2026.\n\n2025 – 30 G 5.08 ERA 4.95 FIP 4.23 xFIP 28 K 33.2 IP\n\nIf you haven’t heard of Shawn Dubin that’s okay. Drafted in the 13th round of the 2018 draft, Dubin throws 6 unique pitches and could be similar to Kyle Leahy before Leahy broke out in 2025. Dubin limits hard contact, keeps the ball on the ground, but is below league average when it comes to strikeout stuff, generating swing and miss, and enticing batters to chase. Dubin is out of minor league options, so the flexibility is very limited, but he has 5 years of remaining control and could be signed to a minor league deal. If the Cardinals felt they could get a higher gear out of his stuff, then it’s possible they could find one of those late-blossoming gems to the already growing group of depth.\n\n2025 – 59 G 4.48 ERA 4.13 FIP 4.48 xFIP 58 K 60.1 IP\n\nRafael Montero will give Cardinals fans Carlos Martinez vibes for sure. Coming from a smaller stature and a whip-like arm motion, it’s very tsunami-esque, so is the erratic command at times. At 14.6 BB% in 2025, that part rings true. It’s 4 pitches that all have positive traits coming out of his hand, and his splitter was a +4 in run value last season to pair with a 95+ mph heater and an above-average breaking ball as well. Montero also has closing experience, with 30 saves credited to him from 2020-2023 as a closer by committee type situation in Houston before the arrival of Josh Hader. Command will always be the biggest question mark with Montero, but for the most part, the results are there, and the Cardinals could entice him with the potential to put him in late-game high-leverage/closing situations that could inevitably lead to a mid-season trade to a contender that would return more prospects to the Cardinals’ growing pipeline.\n\nAre any of these guys true difference makers in the grand scheme of things? Probably not. But the benefit of being in the situation the Cardinals are they can take swings on upside arms like Montero, Stanek, and Perez, but also benefit from veterans like Borucki and Suter, while also having the opportunity to give guys like Dubin a real shot at a big league roster spot. When doing some research on the free agent reliever market this weekend, these were the names remaining that stuck out to me the most, and the ones I think the Cardinals could buy low on and get really good value out of. Ultimately, what the team can accomplish on the trade market will tell the tale of what roster needs will remain heading into spring training, but be certain that more changes to the roster are coming – how soon is anyone’s guess at this point.",

    "description": "Despite a tough season, the Twins' farm system is booming with talent like Walker Jenkins and Emmanuel Rodriguez.",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Twins have quietly built one of baseball's strongest farm systems, and a recent MLB.com report confirms what scouts and analysts have been saying all year.\n\nDespite finishing the 2025 season with a disappointing 70-92 record and landing in fourth place in the American League Central, the Twins' future remains bright thanks to a talented collection of young players who could make a major impact in 2026 and beyond.\n\nMLB Pipeline's Sam Dykstra included the Twins among the organizations that took the biggest jumps in 2025, highlighting the development of several top prospects.\n\n\"Despite an early hamstring strain, 2023 fifth overall pick Walker Jenkins solidified his place as one of the game's best hitting prospects with his climb to Double-A Wichita, and he gives the Twins a\" strong foundation for the future, Dykstra wrote. \"At the time of our midseason farm system rankings, Minnesota boasted six Top 100 talents and placed second,\" he added, noting that while guys moving up will cause some movement in the rankings, there's no denying Jenkins' star power alongside the toolsy Emmanuel Rodriguez.\n\nHow soon will we see Emmanuel Rodriguez with the #MNTwins in 2026?\n\nSlashed .258/.429/.423 (.853 OPS) at just 22 years old in 52 games at Triple-A.\n\nAlso had an OPS over 1.000 in the Dominican Winter League. pic.twitter.com/9PIiMtDPYP\n\n— SleeperTwins (@SleeperMLBTwins) November 29, 2025\n\nThe Twins finished 18 games out of first place in 2025, but that rough season came with a silver lining as the organization held a trade deadline fire sale that brought back several promising prospects and helped restock an already impressive farm system.\n\nJenkins, who is currently ranked as the number three overall prospect in baseball by MLB Pipeline, showed why he's considered a future superstar by advancing all the way to Triple-A St. Paul at just 20 years old and making significant progress with his power development.\n\nThe five-tool outfielder hit .282/.394/.439 across 82 games in 2024 at multiple levels before working through the upper minors in 2025, and scouts believe he has the potential to be the top prospect in baseball heading into his big league debut.\n\nWalker Jenkins played a career-high 84 games this season and looked great. The 20-year-old slashed .286/.399/.451 with an .850 OPS and a 136 wRC+. His balanced offensive profile and ability to get his barrel in the zone on time allows for plenty of pull-side contact. pic.twitter.com/kj3aalA9Hy\n\n— Running From The OPS (@OPS_BASEBALL) November 29, 2025\n\nRodriguez, the Twins' number two prospect who ranks 32nd overall in MLB Pipeline's Top 100, also made waves by playing through injuries and showing elite plate discipline at Triple-A.\n\nAfter missing significant time with thumb issues, the 22-year-old Dominican outfielder crushed opposing pitching in the Dominican Winter League during the offseason, posting a .292/.417/.646 slash line with four home runs in just 18 games and earning MVP honors at an all-star game.\n\nBest Twins prospect per position:\n\nC: Eduardo Tait\n1B: Enrique Jimenez\n2B: Dameury Pena\nSS: Kaelen Culpepper 🎥\n3B: Andy Lugo\nLF: Gabriel Gonzalez\nCF: Emmanuel Rodriguez\nRF: Walker Jenkins\nDH: Hendry Mendez\n\nRHP: Riley Quick\nLHP: Kendry Rojas\n\nOF is elite 💎 pic.twitter.com/FQxEKnF9Mm\n\n— LouisAnalysis (@LouisAnalysis) December 22, 2025\n\nBoth Jenkins and Rodriguez could potentially make their Minnesota debuts sometime in 2026, with Jenkins likely arriving in the summer months and Rodriguez potentially cracking the Opening Day roster if he performs well in spring training.\n\nThe combination of Jenkins' all-around skill set and Rodriguez's power-patience approach gives the Twins two legitimate impact bats who could help turn around a franchise that has struggled to compete in recent years, and the additions made at the trade deadline have only strengthened a system that already ranked among baseball's best.",

    "title": "Atlanta Braves 2026 Draft Targets: Sawyer Strosnider",
    "description": "Sawyer Strosnider is an exciting sophomore outfielder who could tempt the Braves in the 2026 MLB Draft.",
    "fullText": "With the Atlanta Braves draft position being settled in as of last week, it is now time to start taking a look at some of the potential targets for the team in the 2026 MLB Draft. This series will take a look at 10 players who will have some chance to be available for the team with the ninth pick. We will be skipping over the four guys who as of right now have no shot at falling that far, the top three shortstops (Roch Cholowsky, Grady Emerson, Justin Lebron) and the top pitcher (Liam Peterson).\n\nWe will continue our series with the second of the big bats in the Braves tier, with exciting sophomore Sawyer Strosnider following AJ Gracia. This group of players is based on how things look ahead of the spring, as players could see their stock or even game change significantly over the next eight months.\n\nSawyer Strosnider is a sophomore outfielder at TCU who had a huge freshman season to get him into the conversation for the Top 10. He’s a 6’2’, 200-pound prospect that both bats and throws left-handed. In his freshman year he hit .350/.420/.650 with 13 doubles, 10 triples, 11 homers, and 10 steals in 14 chances. He also walked 20 times against 47 strikeouts in his 251 plate appearances.\n\nStrosnider is an exciting power and speed combo athlete. He brings both plus power and speed grades, which helped to translate into double digits in doubles, triples, homers, and steals as a true freshman last spring. His hit tool projects more as average as he is prone to chasing pitches and could do a better job at taking walks, but it did play very well last year. Defensively he has a real chance to stick in center with his plus speed and arm, though he will need to convert there as a pro after playing mostly right field in college in deference to another high end prospect. Either way he has the ability to be a strong defender at one of those positions.\n\nStrosnider could just be starting to tap into his potential. He is a former three-sport athlete in high school who was also a two-way prospect at one time as a pitcher, so there could be further gains for him as he continues to focus on hitting 100% of the time. He may even be the most exciting prospect in this draft, especially among the college prospects, as he is always a threat to do something in every phase of the game.\n\nIt’s worth noting that as of now we have covered six players in this series (Strosnider, Gracia, Tyler Spangler, Jacob Lombard, Eric Becker, and Tyler Bell). That means if the previously mentioned Top 3 and the top pitcher in the draft (Cholowsky, Emerson, Lebron, and Peterson) are all taken ahead of the Braves, they will have their choice of at least two of the guys we covered so far with the #9 selection – with four more profiles of prospects in this range yet to come.",

Happy Birthday to Geoff Zahn* and other former Cubs.\n\n“… to all mankind, America’s wish for peace on Earth and goodwill to men everywhere.”\n\n1914 – Washington manager Clark Griffith meets with Walter Johnson in Kansas City and convinces the star to re-sign for $12,500, considerably less than his recent contract with the Chifeds, with the assurance that Griffith would convince the Washington management to spring for a bigger contract later. Washington will later sign Johnson to $16,000 a year for five years. Griffith gets $6,000 from Charles Comiskey to allow Johnson to repay his Chifed signing bonus. (2)\n\n1957 – In a continuing family squabble, Charles Comiskey, Jr. denies his sister, Mrs. Dorothy Comiskey Rigney’s, allegation that he used the “rule or ruin” tactic to gain control of the club. (2)\n\n1974 – The race to sign newly-minted free agent Catfish Hunter begins in the law offices of Cherry, Cherry & Flythe in Ahoskie, North Carolina. Yankee and Red Sox representatives are the first arrivals. (2)\n\n1986 – After finding no other clubs interested in signing him, free agent pitcher and 20-game winner Jack Morris agrees to salary arbitration with the Tigers while at the same time accusing the major league owners of collusion against free agents. Morris had offered to sign a one-year contract, with salary to be determined by an arbitrator, with either the Yankees, Angels, Twins or Phillies, but was turned down by all four. (1,2)\n\n1991 – Former minor league umpire Pam Postema files a sex discrimination suit against the National and American leagues, the Triple-A Alliance, and the Baseball Office for Umpire Development. (2)\n\n2001 – Free agent Moises Alou (.331, 27, 108) signs a $27 million, three-year deal with the Cubs. The former Astro All-Star’s presence in the Chicago line-up, along with Fred McGriff and Sammy Sosa, will give the team a fearsome 3-4-5 threesome. The Cubs also trade OF Michael Tucker to the Royals in exchange for a player to be named (who turned out to he minor leaguer Shawn Sonnier).

    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

    "description": "In the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.",
    "fullText": "Heather McPhee, associate general counsel for the NFL Players Association since 2009, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday, alleging that former executive director Lloyd Howell Jr. and two current top union executives conspired to prevent her from cooperating with a criminal investigation into union finances, as reported by ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr.\n\nMcPhee was placed on paid administrative leave on Aug. 14 after she was the subject of multiple employee complaints, per Van Natta and ESPN's Jeff Passan, that reportedly included accusations of failing to follow supervisors' directions, bullying colleagues and disrupting the union's work environment.\n\nIn the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.\n\nMonths before she was placed on leave, she made allegations that sparked an FBI investigation into the NFLPA, the MLBPA and OneTeam Partners, their $2 billion licensing company.\n\nMcPhee is reportedly seeking at least $10 million in damages, according to the suit, in which she accuses Howell of illegal misconduct, sex discrimination, breach of fiduciary duty and retaliation, per ESPN.\n\nHowell, who became the NFLPA's executive director in 2022, resigned on July 17. He stepped down after a tumultuous month of criticism that stemmed from Pablo Torre and Mike Florio reporting that the NFL and NFLPA covered up a ruling on a collusion grievance. An arbitrator, Christopher Droney, found that, in the wake of Deshaun Watson signing a fully-guaranteed $230 million contract with the Cleveland Browns ahead of the 2022 season, league executives encouraged team owners to reduce the amount of guaranteed money players received in subsequent contracts.\n\nDroney, though, concluded that he couldn't prove by a \"clear preponderance\" that NFL teams followed suit. Still, the details revealed from that 2022 annual owners' meeting were indelible, and so was the fact that the NFLPA reportedly agreed with the NFL to keep the collusion grievance findings under wraps. That left a stain on Howell's reputation, as did other matters, chief among them his reported spending of union funds for visits to strip clubs.\n\nAfter McPhee initially flagged concerns within the NFLPA in November 2024 regarding senior executives potentially violating labor laws governing conflicts of interest and the fulfillment of fiduciary duties, as reported by ESPN, she alleges that union leaders targeted her \"in order to conceal and deflect their own misconduct and failures.\"\n\nMcPhee questioned the legality of a senior executive incentive plan proposed by OneTeam Partners that would have paid millions of dollars in bonuses to Howell, MLBPA executive director Tony Clark and others, per ESPN, which also reported that McPhee states in the suit that she opposed Howell's decision to keep the collusion grievance findings secret.\n\nThe suit says, according to ESPN, that the union leaders signing a confidentiality agreement with the NFL \"raised concerns about a potential violation of the NFLPA's duty of fair representation to players.\"\n\nWhen union leaders discovered McPhee was in line to testify as a grand jury witness about what she deemed to be criminal misconduct by Howell and others, she alleges she was removed from meetings and cut off from the board and players.\n\nShe was then placed on leave due to her \"workplace behavior.\" McPhee believes that was a tactic to prevent her from cooperating with the DOJ.",

    "description": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing […]",
    "fullText": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing a notable free agent they have been linked to for a very team-friendly rate.\n\nThe Mets and Yankees had very different results in their 2025 MLB campaigns. While both clubs entered the year as serious World Series contenders and were two of the best teams in the league during the first half, the club from Queens shockingly collapsed in September and missed the playoffs. Although the Yanks got to the playoffs, they were ousted in the divisional round by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nAfter seasons that fell well below expectations, both clubs have been active this offseason as they look to improve their roster. Oddly enough, they are also in the market for the same positions. Each team is looking to bolster its rotation and is reportedly pursuing Michael King. They are also looking for new first basemen.\n\nTo the chagrin of Mets fans, the team lost home run king Pete Alonso in free agency to the Baltimore Orioles. While the Yankees are expected to move on from Paul Goldschmidt. Unsurprisingly, they have both been linked to Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami. A player whose market is reportedly weaker than he and his reps expected.\n\nRecent reports have suggested the corner infielder’s market has been weak as he closes in on the Dec. 22 deadline for him to sign with an MLB team. It has created some speculation that he might just end up returning to Japan if he doesn’t get the sort of offer he is looking for. However, Ken Rosenthal doesn’t buy into that discourse.\n\nIn a new report, he spoke about how Murakami’s swing and miss rate is believed to be the big reason why some teams are balking at giving the 25-year-old a big long-term contract. Rosenthal believes that the issue is overblown, and Shohei Ohtani had a higher rate before he made the move from Japan in 2018. The MLB insider firmly believes Murakami will be playing in the MLB next season.\n\nMunetaka Murakami stats: 69 G, .286 AVG, .392 OBP, .659 SLG, 1.051 OPS, 24 HR, 52 RBI, 40 R\n\nThat is very good news for the Mets and Yankees. Despite the questions about his defense and swing and miss rate, he is one of the greatest home run hitters in Japanese baseball history, and still hasn’t even hit his prime. With far fewer teams expected to be in on him, the pair of New York clubs could get a young player with huge upside at a far cheaper rate than they expected a month ago, or for fewer years.\n\nNew York Jets Player Requests Release From Team After 28-Point Loss\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "fullText": "In his three MLB seasons, Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Brice Turang has seen his batting average improve 40 points each season. He's continued to show marked improvement at the plate, which might lead some Brewers fans to consider this point.\n\nCould Turang hit .300 in the 2026 MLB season? Yes, he could.\n\nLook at Turang's power numbers. In 2023, Turang hit six home runs in 404 at-bats; in 2025, he hit seven home runs in 559 at-bats; and last season, Turang hit 18 home runs in 584 at-bats. As four doubles, Turang has gone from nine to 24 to 28 over his first three seasons.\n\nThis obviously shows that Turang is getting better and better each season.\n\nBrewers manager Pat Murphy might be smiling like a proud papa when he looks out at second base and sees Turang turning double plays with ease. \"He's a ballplayer,\" Murphy has said about Turang. \"You can see it. You can smell it. The best is yet to come for him. He's got so much to give.\"\n\nWhat's next for the Brewers' team MVP from 2025? He's going to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic next year. Turang has played for Team USA in teenage baseball series and remembers those times quite vividly.\n\n\"That was some of the best times that I’ve ever had playing baseball,\" Turang said, according to an MLB.com article. \"I was looking forward to seeing who the team was [for the 2026 tournament], and when I find out it’s me, I was like, 'Oh, man, I’m excited.'\"\n\nFor the Brewers, they want to make sure that they stay atop the National League Central Division again in 2026. They'd also like a return trip to the National League Championship Series and, potentially, knock off the Los Angeles Dodgers en route to their own World Series championship.\n\nTurang is quickly ensuring that he's a fan favorite, not only for his play on the field but how he handles himself as an MLB player.\n\nThe Brewers aren't going to bring a bunch of knuckleheads into the organization. Brewers president of baseball operations Matt Arnold is very selective on who he wants to bring on the team. And, yes, you better believe Murphy has a thing or two to say when new players are being considered for the ballclub.\n\nHe's worked hard to make sure the Brewers' clubhouse is strong and full of teammates that will stick up for one another.\n\nWatch for Turang to have a great 2026 and, hopefully, have a pleasant World Baseball Classic experience and avoid getting injured.\n\nRemember to join our BREWERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE! You can post your own thoughts, in text or video form, and you can engage with our Roundtable staff, as well as other Brewers fans. If prompted to download the Roundtable APP, that's free too.",

    "description": "MLB free agency 2025-26 hasn’t been quite as active as everyone hoped, with many of the top MLB free agents […]",
    "fullText": "MLB free agency 2025-26 hasn’t been quite as active as everyone hoped, with many of the top MLB free agents still available as Christmas Day nears. There’s still plenty of time for big signings to happen, meaning teams that have fallen short of expectations in the open market could still turn things around.\n\nMore than a month into MLB free agency, we’re highlighting some of the winners and losers so far.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays responded to a heartbreaking loss in Game 7 of the World Series by splurging early in MLB free agency. Dylan Cease got a hefty contract, but Toronto is rightfully betting on a co-ace who finished in the 95th percentile for Whiff rate last season and in the 89th percentile for strikeout rate. To support the back of the rotation, the club brought in Cody Ponce after he turned his career around overseas. Most recently, the Blue Jays bullpen got better with the addition of Tyler Rogers (2.38 ERA over 147.2 IP in last two seasons). Best of all, there’s still a very real chance of Bo Bichette being re-signed and a potential Kyle Tucker signing.\n\nBuster Posey isn’t at fault for what’s happening with the San Francisco Giants right now. The problem is ownership. It started in March when a 10% stake in the franchise was sold to the private equity firm Sixth Street. Things don’t get better when private equity is brought in; reducing costs to increase revenue is the goal. Suddenly this offseason, the Giants reportedly aren’t interested in spending $100 million-plus on a starting pitcher. Sixth Street might not like to hear this, but that’s the going rate for quality starters in the open market. There’s no reason to expect San Francisco to start splurging later this winter.\n\nThe back-to-back World Series champions had a glaring need to address this offseason, and they took care of it quickly. Over the last three seasons, the All-Star closer ranks 11th among qualified relievers in ERA (2.48), sixth in batting average allowed ($0.173$) and third in strikeout rate (38.4%). Los Angeles needed a shutdown closer; Diaz provides it. Equally as valuable to Los Angeles, Diaz took a short-term deal (three years, $69 million) so the Dodgers are still positioning themselves for long-term flexibility if a salary cap is implemented.\n\nWe could give credit to the Pittsburgh Pirates for being aggressive early in MLB free agency and making a genuine effort to sign Kyle Schwarber. Here’s the problem: Pittsburgh is striking out on all the top MLB free agents. Why? Because Pirates owner Bob Nutting has put this franchise in such a disastrous and poorly-run state that top talent wants nothing to do with the club. So, with an MLB salary floor likely incoming, Pittsburgh will have to vastly overspend on mid-tier free agents and overpay for marginal talent just to meet the cap floor. This is what happens when an owner spends years fielding an awful team and investing as little as he can into the on-field product.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles are finally spending serious money in MLB free agency. Yes, the Pete Alonso contract (five years, $155 million) is a significant commitment to a 31-year-old who can barely play first base. However, it was also a desperately needed addition since the Orioles lineup finished 19th in slugging and 21st in OPS last season. Plus, this signing positions Baltimore to flip either Ryan Mountcastle or Coby Mayo for a starting pitcher. We’ve been waiting years for the Orioles to spend, and they finally did it; credit is due.\n\nIn the span of just a few weeks, the New York Mets moved on from Brandon Nimmo, Pete Alonso and Edwin Diaz. We can justify in some regard the decision to not re-sign Alonso, but giving Jorge Polanco $20 million per year is a massive risk given his knee issues. New York certainly improved defensively by bringing in Marcus Semien, but he’s coming off a two-year stretch at the plate with a .234/.307/.379 triple-slash line and a .686 OPS. So, if his fielding dips considerably in his age 35 season, he’s a complete negative for New York. Oh, we’re also still waiting on the Mets rotation to be addressed.",

    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith seemingly forgot the 2020 MLB season was shortened due to Covid-19 when he claimed New York Mets star Pete Alonso was injured and barely played.\n\nOn Wednesday, ESPN’s Jeff Passan announced that Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal to join the Baltimore Orioles. Alonso, 31, played his first seven seasons in the MLB with the Mets and was considered one of the faces of the franchise.\n\nBREAKING: First baseman Pete Alonso and the Baltimore Orioles are finalizing a five-year, $155 million contract, sources tell ESPN. Alonso leaves the Mets to make a loaded AL East even better.\n\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 10, 2025\n\nHours later, Smith reacted to the news on The Stephen A. Smith Show. First, he lambasted the Mets for allowing star closer Edwin Diaz to sign with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers. He applied that same criticism to Alonso’s departure.\n\nWhile talking about Alonso’s stats, however, Smith appeared to overlook a vitally important piece of context:\n\nHe’s been in the league about seven years. Let’s look at him, alright? He got injured in year two. So, he hits 53 home runs and 120 RBIs his first year in 2019. Next year, he gets hurt, only played in 57 games. Still smacks 16 home runs, 35 RBIs. Next year, 37 home runs, 94 RBIs. The year after that, 2022, 40 home runs, 131 RBIs.\n\nTo Smith’s credit, he quickly realized his mistake with the 2020 season. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the MLB regular season was only 60 games. With 57 games played, Alonso appeared in nearly every game of that shortened season.\n\n“Actually, 2020 was Covid,” Smith clarified. “I apologize. You gotta remember that, because there was a truncated season because all the stuff that was going on in Covid.”\n\nUnfortunately for Smith, the damage was already done and social media users rushed to roast him for the error.\n\nStephen A Smith said Pete Alonso \"got hurt and only played in 57 games his 2nd season\", when really it was the 60 game shortened COVID season\n\n— Fuzzy (@fuzzyfromyt) December 11, 2025\n\nSAS and @ColinCowherd have made a fortune talking about sports despite knowing nothing about sports. It's legit impressive. https://t.co/sdFldE7oIR\n\n— Funhouse (@BackAftaThis) December 12, 2025\n\nHas anyone ever brought up the fact that these guys are simply on TV so often that it’s actually not shocking at all that they don’t follow sports? https://t.co/ZpAeKvuRDl\n\n— Tim Kalinowski (@TimmyKal12) December 12, 2025\n\nHighest paid sports \"commentator\" in the business btw https://t.co/fN2CvjZbgj\n\n— Dean Kremer Enjoyer (@DK_Enj) December 11, 2025\n\nThis clown is the highest paid employee at ESPN https://t.co/JgIjYkf17t\n\n— cg (@colingreten) December 12, 2025\n\nAnd to think Stephen A. Smith gets paid over $100 million to spew nonsense like this day in and day out, with no pushback from anyone with real power. Sports journalism is dying a thousand deaths because of people like him https://t.co/tz2ZomvIoW\n\n— Lucas Lyon (@Lucas11Lyon) December 12, 2025\n\nThe post Stephen A.

    "fullText": "The 2025 MLB winter meetings are over, and there were plenty of big takeaways with some of the biggest names off the board in a few days.\n\nThe Ketel Marte trade rumors swirled. The New York Mets saw Edwin Diaz leave for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Pete Alonso sign a big contract with the Baltimore Orioles (which left Mets fans NOT OK). Kyle Schwarber is still a member of the Philadelphia Phillies. Whew! That's a lot of news!\n\nBut there are still some big names left to be signed. So we're rounding them up for you in order of talent. Let's go:\n\nThe jewel of the offseason didn't sign anywhere. Whoever signing him should be prepared to dole out A LOT of money for a player who can do it all.\n\nHe was positively raking before a knee injury prematurely ended his regular season. Anyone looking for a shortstop who can drive in runs would love to sign him.\n\nHe's 32 and spent some time on the injured list this season. But he's still a top infield option for contenders.\n\nWere his numbers inflated thanks to Yankee Stadium? We'll see if that's true, if he signs elsewhere.\n\nThe pitcher who went from bullpen stud to solid starter should get paid.\n\nHe's probably a middle-of-the-rotation guy, but a VERY valuable one if he keeps this up.\n\nHis rough end of season may be a factor, but he's still a top-end starting pitcher still in his prime. That's worth a lot.\n\nThe Japanese slugger has been posted by his team, the Yakult Swallows, and he could be a sneaky good addition.\n\nHe's getting up there in age (34) but he can still hit dingers.\n\nAnother Japanese name who could end up being worth the investment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: MLB rumors: Best remaining free agents after 2025 winter meetings",

    "fullText": "Mets slammed as “doomed” by former MLB execs after Alonso news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt took less than a day for the mood of New York Mets’ observers to hit rock bottom. After losing All-Star closer Edwin Diaz to the Los Angeles Dodgers, former MLB general managers Jim Duquette, Jim Bowden and Steve Phillips spent the morning on MLB Network Radio suggesting the New York Mets should be “panicked.” Hours later, it was reported that Pete Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles, and the same group reportedly shifted their tone to “doomed.”\n\nSNY broadcaster and former Met Ron Darling on MLB Network’s MLB Tonight said he was “flabbergasted.”\n\nAlonso’s departure is not only a big blow to the Mets’ offseason plans, but it ends a franchise era.\n\nAlonso, who turned 31 Sunday,  hit .272 with 38 home runs, 126 RBI and an .871 OPS over 162 games last season. He finishes his Mets tenure with 264 career home runs, the most in franchise history, along with 712 RBI and a .253 career batting average.\n\nThat’s elite middle-of-the-order production vanishing overnight.\n\nNew York also missed on a potential left-handed power fit when Kyle Schwarber re-signed with Philadelphia.  Brandon Nimmo’s departure via trade to the Texas Rangers for Marcus Semien creates even more questions for the Mets.\n\nEven at closer, the Mets are asked to trust Devin Williams, a new arrival and high-pressure answer after Diaz left for Los Angeles on a three-year, $69 million deal. Mets GM David Stearns said they think that Williams’ career-worst year against the Mets in 2025 was because he was “unlucky.”\n\nWith the biggest names gone, Stearns must get creative. Options remain, but none come without risk — and none replace Alonso’s presence by themselves.\n\nHere are the most realistic paths still on the board:\n\nCody Bellinger\nA lefty bat with defensive flexibility in the outfield and at first base. Once an MVP-caliber slugger, he hit .272 with 29 homers last season.\n\nOne of the few impact bats left on the market after 2025: last season he hit .266 with 22 home runs, 73 RBI, 91 runs scored, and compiled an .841 OPS in 136 games.\n\nAlex Bregman\nA high-floor infielder who could stabilize the batting order, but doesn’t replace pure first-base power. He’s one of the bigger bats still available.\n\nBo Bichette\nMore contact hitter than slugger, but an impact offensive piece who could reshape the overall lineup profile.\n\nThose names provide lineup value, but the Mets lost production and popular players.\n\nAlsono was not only a durable first baseman who has led the MLB in home runs since his debut. Diaz was a closer who electrified Citi Field with his entrances and dominated in high leverage.  Fans identified with them, and their teammates reportedly embraced them.\n\nThe former GMs on MLB Network Radio have seen enough offseasons to know when desperation is creeping in. Two franchise pillars are gone. The division remains brutal. And the fan base just watched its most iconic slugger pack for Baltimore.\n\nDarling was blunt in his assessment, too.\n\n\"This is a real loss for the New York Mets,\" Darling said.\n\nIf the Mets don’t respond aggressively and fast, this winter may be remembered not as a turning point but as a full-scale collapse.",

There have been rumors suggesting the Los Angeles Dodgers could be closing in on a trade for Skubal; however, those rumors have been shut down.\n\nThe “Skubal to Dodgers” rumors at the Winter Meetings are all smoke and “not real,” as reported by FanSided’s Robert Murray on The Baseball Insiders. As of now, it doesn’t appear that Skubal will be traded from Detroit, but if an offer blows away the organization, it could entice them to pull the trigger.\n\nThe Tigers want to keep Skubal and pursue a trip to the 2026 World Series, but more needs to be done. If Detroit keeps the back-to-back AL Cy Young Award winner, it needs to make moves to maximize the 2026 season. If not, the Tigers would be better off trading Skubal to maximize his value.\n\nSkubal would demand a very, very big trade package, and unless a team is willing to meet Detroit’s demands, it doesn’t seem likely to happen this winter. The Tigers need to pick a lane on Skubal, but for now, the rumors of a trade to the Dodgers don’t seem to have any legs.\n\nBaltimore Orioles sign Pete Alonso to massive five-year contract\n\nBaltimore Orioles discussing historic trade with Washington in 2025\n\nLatest MLB Rumors on Braves Caution, Reds-Marte, Mets-Alonso, Blue Jays Trade",

Acquired from the Nationals at the July deadline, Finnegan impressed with a 1.50 ERA and 11.5 K/9 rate in 16 appearances with the Tigers, putting himself in line for save opportunities in 2026.\n\nThe Orioles and Nationals have had \"steady communication\" about SP MacKenzie Gore, whose name has been floated in trade rumors since the July deadline, Jon Morosi reports.\n\nTampa Bay's Brandon Lowe is among the names surfacing in trade talks for second basemen, and the chances of a deal this week are \"increasing,\" Jon Morosi reports.\n\nThe market for Diamondbacks 2B Ketel Marte is \"heating up,\" Jon Heyman reports, with the Red Sox, Mariners, Blue Jays, Phillies and Rays all believed to be in the mix for the All-Star.\n\nThe Red Sox have discussed a Corey Seager trade with the Rangers, the Boston Globe reports, though WEEI's Rob Bradford says the talks don't have momentum at the moment. Seager has been a superstar with the Rangers when healthy, but Texas is on a mission to shed salary this winter and the two-time World Series MVP still has six years remaining on his massive contract.\n\nThe Marlins are \"engaged\" in trade talks involving SP Edward Cabrera with numerous teams, Jon Heyman reports. Cabrera enjoyed a breakout season for Miami in 2025 and was a popular name leading up to the July deadline.\n\nThe Pirates have agreed to a one-year, $7.75 million deal with reliever Gregory Soto, who posted a 4.18 ERA and 3.42 FIP between the Orioles and Mets in 2025.\n\nThe Cubs met with the star infielder over Zoom \"a few weeks ago,\" per Robert Murray.\n\nWith Kyle Schwarber off the market, and Baltimore being one potential landing spot for him, Morosi reports that the Orioles have spoken with the camp of Kyle Tucker.\n\nBefore Kyle Schwarber agreed to re-sign with the Phillies, Baltimore matched Philadelphia's offer of five years, $150 million, per Rosenthal. The Reds offered Schwarber a five-year deal \"in the $125 million range,\" while the Pirates offered four years and $120 million.\n\nPer Jon Morosi, within the AL East, the Red Sox are viewed as a stronger trade candidate for star infielder Ketel Marte than the Blue Jays, because of Boston's depth of MLB-ready starters.\n\nSpeaking at the Winter Meetings, agent Scott Boras said he expects 1B Pete Alonso's market to pick up now that Kyle Schwarber has signed. Alonso has reportedly been in and out of the meetings to meet with teams, including the Red Sox and Orioles.\n\nThe Tigers have been floated as a potential Alex Bregman suitor, but they also have real interest in SS Ha-Seong Kim, according to the Detroit Free Press. Kim, a terrific defender, landed with the Rays last offseason but missed most of 2025 and finished the year with the Braves. After a healthy September, Kim opted out of his deal.\n\nThe Mets \"may be hesitant to go more than three years\" on a new deal for 1B Pete Alonso, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reports, which could complicate the path to a reunion between the two sides. Alonso settled for a short deal last winter but is looking for long-term security this time around after a strong season at the plate.\n\nThe Angels are acquiring infielder Vaughn Grissom from the Red Sox, in exchange for OF prospect Isaiah Jackson. Grissom, Boston's one-for-one return for Chris Sale two years ago, struggled in a brief MLB stint in 2024 and spent all of 2025 in the minor leagues, posting a .783 OPS. 2026 will be Grissom's age-25 season.\n\nThe Padres and GM A.J. Preller are \"shooting big\" in trade talks and working on \"multiple fronts\" to put together significant deals, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports.\n\nWith the Mets' former closer, Edwin Diaz, off the market, New York is now viewed as a suitor for the new top available reliever, Robert Suarez. The Blue Jays are also in the mix, per Jon Morosi.\n\nFormer Mets closer Edwin Diaz has agreed to a deal with the Dodgers, according to The Athletic's Will Sammon, bolstering a bullpen that was a rare weakness for much of the regular season in 2025.\n\nDiaz's deal is worth $69 million over three years, per Jeff Passan.\n\nThe Phillies have agreed to a five-year, $150 million deal to re-sign DH Kyle Schwarber, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. Schwarber, who was the runner-up for NL MVP in 2025, was also pursued by the Reds, Pirates, Orioles and Mets.\n\nWhile the Red Sox are taking a look at a bevy of infielders, including Pete Alonso, Bo Bichette and Ketel Marte, a reunion with Alex Bregman remains Boston's \"No. 1 target,\" according to The Athletic. A trade for Isaac Paredes could be a fallback option if a deal can't be reached with Bregman.\n\nHarris answered a question about Tarik Skubal's trade status, as the executive said he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't listen. Skubal has one year left on his contract, which could prompt Detroit to trade him before the season begins if the team gets a good deal.\n\nMatz is a former starter who transitioned to the bullpen last season, and found success with the Red Sox late in the year, finishing the season with a 3.05 ERA between St. Louis and Boston. Topkin adds that the deal will span two years.\n\nMegill was the best relievers on the Brewers last year, but Milwaukee is always exploring different ways to mix up its team. The Yankees have a reliever vacancy after losing Devin Williams to the Mets in free agency, but the Mets also still need to upgrade their bullpen.\n\nAccording to Rome, no deal is close, but Houston's interest in Baz is real and could be the type of move that the team prefers. Baz is coming off a season where he made a career-high 31 starts for the Rays, but still pitched to a 4.87 ERA.\n\nGore is one of several pitchers who could be traded, as the Nats look to build for the future. While Golden also reports the Red Sox and Padres explored a Gore trade at the trade deadline, he specifically names the Yankees as a team that has made a call in recent days.\n\nSuarez is one of the top relievers on the market, and the Mets, Blue Jays and Dodgers are all teams that have shown interest in improving their bullpens. Those three teams have also been linked to top closer Edwin Diaz, which makes Suarez a potential fallback option.\n\nCotillo added that other teams may be waiting for Schwarber to sign before moving on to other players. While the Phillies are believed to be the favorite to retain the DH, but the Red Sox, Mets, Reds and Pirates have all been linked to Schwarber as well.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are willing to listen on 2B Ketel Marte and are emphasizing MLB-ready starting pitchers in talks, but their asking price remains high, according to Jon Morosi. Marte has been one of the hottest names as the Winter Meetings get underway, indicating teams believe he can be had in a trade, and interested teams  reportedly include the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Mariners.\n\nThe Orioles are in on free agent starter Ranger Suarez, Jon Heyman reports. Suarez is one of the top free agent arms available, and Baltimore has been connected to starters since the offseason began.\n\nFree agent 1B Pete Alonso is heading to the Winter Meetings to meet with interested suitors, including the Red Sox and Orioles, according to the New York Post. Alonso lives a short drive away from Orlando, so he will meet in-person with interested teams.\n\nYankees GM Brian Cashman said at the Winter Meetings that the organization is \"open-minded\" but doesn't have to do as much as last winter because of the talent on the roster. \"We have really good players on this roster, and we are covered in most all areas that you need to be covered.\"\n\nThe Nationals are receiving heavy interest in SS CJ Abrams in trade talks and are open to dealing him, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon report. Washington is also talking about deals centered on SP MacKenzie Gore as the new front office looks to shake up the organization.\n\nThe Blue Jays are also among teams talking to the Diamondbacks about 2B Ketel Marte, Jon Heyman reports. The Red Sox and Mariners were reported Sunday as potential suitors for Marte, though there doesn't appear to be much traction in talks yet, Heyman reports.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have agreed to a one-year, $7.5 million deal with pitcher Michael Soroka. Soroka split the 2025 season with the Nationals and Cubs, posting a 4.87 ERA and 4.16 FIP over 16 starts with Washington before an injury limited him to 8.1 strong innings with Chicago. Soroka could function as either a starter or reliever in Arizona.\n\nDiamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte is in high demand this offseason, as a number of suitors have pursued the All-Star infielder. The Red Sox, Mariners, Pirates, Rays, Tigers and Jays are all listed as targets by New York Post's Jon Heyman.\n\nOne of the top arms available on the market, Valdez has been travelling from coast to coast, as it's reported he's visited Baltimore, New York and San Francisco. The 32-year-old lefty finished his eighth season in Houston last year with a .366 ERA.\n\nThe Pirates said they were looking to spend this offseason around Paul Skenes. How about Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber? Pittsburgh has reportedly put a four-year offer in for the free agent, while Red Sox, Cubs, Reds and others remain in the mix.\n\nThe Mariners have acquire reliever Jose Ferrer from the Nationals, in exchange for catching prospect Harry Ford and pitching prospect Isaac Lyon. The 25-year-old Ferrer has unspectacular raw numbers as a major-leaguer, but a career 3.33 FIP, impressive walk rate and high velocity make him a potential high-leverage reliever for Seattle, while Ford is a consensus top-75 prospect in baseball and could be the Nationals' catcher of the future.\n\nDespite July's firesale, the Minnesota Twins are not planning to trade Joe Ryan, Byron Buxton or Pablo Lopez this winter, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports. The Twins discussed a Ryan trade with the Boston Red Sox at the deadline but decided against dealing their young ace.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers remain \"engaged\" with teams on a potential Tarik Skubal trade, according to ESPN's Buster Olney, but they are still unsure about dealing him and have an \"enormous\" asking price. Skubal, the back-to-back reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, is set to be a free agent after the 2026 season and is reportedly far apart in extension talks with the Tigers.\n\nP Ryan Yarbrough (re-signed, 1yr/$2.5M)\n\nP Drew Anderson (1yr/$7M with $10M option for 2027)\n\nRP Kyle Finnegan (re-signed, 2yr/$19M)\n\n1B Josh Naylor (re-signed, 5yr/$92.5M)\n\nDH Kyle Schwarber (re-signed, 5yr/$150M)\n\nCL Emilio Pagan (re-signed, 2yr/$20M)\n\nC James McCann (re-signed, 1yr/$2.75M)\n\nINF Miguel Rojas (re-signed, 1yr/$5.5M)\n\nHere are the remaining free agents from SN's ranking of the top 27 free agents this winter:\n\nJapanese standouts Tatsuya Imai and Kazuma Okamoto were also posted and are available to MLB teams, making for one of the strongest-ever free agent crops of Japanese talent in one offseason.",

    "fullText": "The Mets lost closer Edwin Díaz to the reigning champions Dodgers, with the reliever agreeing to a three year, $69 million contract with Los Angeles and setting a new AAV record for relievers.\n\nThe Mets’ offer to Díaz was for three years and $66 million with some deferrals, though they expressed a willingness to improve the number.\n\nA few factors impacted the Mets’ ability to retain Díaz outside of the pure dollar amount at play.\n\nThe Dodgers’ deal with Díaz also includes some deferrals, about $4.5 million deferred per year.\n\nAnthony DiComo rounded up all the important bits of the Díaz signing and the fallout for the Mets.\n\nDevin Williams was surprised that Díaz did not return, and he expressed excitement at the opportunity to earn the closer role.\n\nDíaz wasn’t the only reliever the Mets lost, as Gregory Soto signed with the Pirates on a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nThe Mets also made an offer to Kyle Schwarber before he re-signed with Philadelphia, offering around three years and $120 million for the free agent slugger.\n\nStar free agent Pete Alonso will now take up more of the spotlight with Schwarber off the board.\n\nThe Mets are reportedly reluctant to go past three years with Alonso.\n\nAnd while the Mets remain interested in a reunion with Alonso, other options exist and remain in play for the team.\n\nDespite the blows taken by the Mets, David Stearns is still optimistic about the team’s offseason.\n\nStearns still understands why Mets fans are feeling frustrated, especially in the wake of how 2025 ended.\n\nJohn Harper wrote about whether Stearns has a plan fans should trust and what things might be other valuable parts of contract decisions other than pure player value.\n\nThe Mets are willing to listen to trade offers for All-Star starter David Peterson, though the price will be considerable.\n\nThe draft lottery was held yesterday, and because the Mets landed outside of the protected top ten picks, the Mets’ pick was docked ten spots and will be 27th overall.\n\nThe Mets and Starling Marte reportedly have mutual interest in a reunion.\n\nHaving spent years with the Mets, Tommy Tanous has been hired by the Rockies as an assistant general manager.\n\nMLB.com looked at the fallout in the wake of the Díaz and Schwarber signings, including where the Mets go from here.\n\nKyle Schwarber returned to the Phillies, agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract.\n\nHis contract is an anomaly in baseball, but Jayson Stark explained why it fits such an unique player.\n\nLeft hander Alec Gamboa and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league split contract with an invite to spring training.\n\nThe Red Sox also traded infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox landed the number one pick in the 2026 draft.\n\nAfter being traded to Detroit last season, Kyle Finnegan re-signed with the Tigers on a two-year contract worth $19 million.\n\nA Pod of Their Own was back with another episode.\n\nDecember 10th is a very busy trade day in Mets history, with three major trades taking place on this date.",
