    "fullText": "MLB Winter Meetings tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWinter Meetings latest news and rumors\n\nFree agent signings and trades by team\n\nThe MLB offseason can move at a painfully slow pace, but if history is any indication, December will be the busiest month, thanks in part to the Winter Meetings.\n\nThe annual congregation of executives, managers and free agents and, of course, agents takes place in Orlando this year, and there is plenty of business to get done.\n\nA fairly impressive crop of free agents is mostly unsigned, though there are some exceptions. Dylan Cease already landed with the Toronto Blue Jays on a seven-year, $210 million deal, while Josh Naylor and Devin Williams are among other names who have earned new deals in the weeks leading up to the Winter Meetings.\n\nThe trade market could be worth watching more closely than the free-agent market as the Winter Meetings play out. While a Tarik Skubal trade doesn't seem imminent or even particularly likely this offseason, Ketel Marte, MacKenzie Gore and Jarren Duran are among the names who have surfaced in rumors.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking all of the latest buzz below, from rumors to signings and trades. Follow along with the latest updates below.\n\nMORE:Ranking the top MLB free agents\n\nThe Red Sox are seen as strong candidates for Ketel Marte compared to the Blue Jays because of their young starting pitching depth, Jon Morosi reports. The Diamondbacks have been known to be targeting young starters in any Marte talks.\n\nThe Tigers have agreed to a two-year, $19 million deal to bring back reliever Kyle Finnegan. Acquired from the Nationals at the July deadline, Finnegan impressed with a 1.50 ERA and 11.5 K/9 rate in 16 appearances with the Tigers, putting himself in line for save opportunities in 2026.\n\nThe Orioles and Nationals have had \"steady communication\" about SP MacKenzie Gore, whose name has been floated in trade rumors since the July deadline, Jon Morosi reports.\n\nTampa Bay's Brandon Lowe is among the names surfacing in trade talks for second basemen, and the chances of a deal this week are \"increasing,\" Jon Morosi reports.\n\nThe market for Diamondbacks 2B Ketel Marte is \"heating up,\" Jon Heyman reports, with the Red Sox, Mariners, Blue Jays, Phillies and Rays all believed to be in the mix for the All-Star.\n\nThe Red Sox have discussed a Corey Seager trade with the Rangers, the Boston Globe reports, though WEEI's Rob Bradford says the talks don't have momentum at the moment. Seager has been a superstar with the Rangers when healthy, but Texas is on a mission to shed salary this winter and the two-time World Series MVP still has six years remaining on his massive contract.\n\nThe Marlins are \"engaged\" in trade talks involving SP Edward Cabrera with numerous teams, Jon Heyman reports. Cabrera enjoyed a breakout season for Miami in 2025 and was a popular name leading up to the July deadline.\n\nThe Pirates have agreed to a one-year, $7.75 million deal with reliever Gregory Soto, who posted a 4.18 ERA and 3.42 FIP between the Orioles and Mets in 2025.\n\nThe Cubs met with the star infielder over Zoom \"a few weeks ago,\" per Robert Murray.\n\nWith Kyle Schwarber off the market, and Baltimore being one potential landing spot for him, Morosi reports that the Orioles have spoken with the camp of Kyle Tucker.\n\nBefore Kyle Schwarber agreed to re-sign with the Phillies, Baltimore matched Philadelphia's offer of five years, $150 million, per Rosenthal. The Reds offered Schwarber a five-year deal \"in the $125 million range,\" while the Pirates offered four years and $120 million.\n\nPer Jon Morosi, within the AL East, the Red Sox are viewed as a stronger trade candidate for star infielder Ketel Marte than the Blue Jays, because of Boston's depth of MLB-ready starters.\n\nSpeaking at the Winter Meetings, agent Scott Boras said he expects 1B Pete Alonso's market to pick up now that Kyle Schwarber has signed. Alonso has reportedly been in and out of the meetings to meet with teams, including the Red Sox and Orioles.\n\nThe Tigers have been floated as a potential Alex Bregman suitor, but they also have real interest in SS Ha-Seong Kim, according to the Detroit Free Press. Kim, a terrific defender, landed with the Rays last offseason but missed most of 2025 and finished the year with the Braves. After a healthy September, Kim opted out of his deal.\n\nThe Mets \"may be hesitant to go more than three years\" on a new deal for 1B Pete Alonso, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reports, which could complicate the path to a reunion between the two sides. Alonso settled for a short deal last winter but is looking for long-term security this time around after a strong season at the plate.\n\nThe Angels are acquiring infielder Vaughn Grissom from the Red Sox, in exchange for OF prospect Isaiah Jackson. Grissom, Boston's one-for-one return for Chris Sale two years ago, struggled in a brief MLB stint in 2024 and spent all of 2025 in the minor leagues, posting a .783 OPS. 2026 will be Grissom's age-25 season.\n\nThe Padres and GM A.J. Preller are \"shooting big\" in trade talks and working on \"multiple fronts\" to put together significant deals, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports.\n\nWith the Mets' former closer, Edwin Diaz, off the market, New York is now viewed as a suitor for the new top available reliever, Robert Suarez. The Blue Jays are also in the mix, per Jon Morosi.\n\nFormer Mets closer Edwin Diaz has agreed to a deal with the Dodgers, according to The Athletic's Will Sammon, bolstering a bullpen that was a rare weakness for much of the regular season in 2025.\n\nDiaz's deal is worth $69 million over three years, per Jeff Passan.\n\nThe Phillies have agreed to a five-year, $150 million deal to re-sign DH Kyle Schwarber, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. Schwarber, who was the runner-up for NL MVP in 2025, was also pursued by the Reds, Pirates, Orioles and Mets.\n\nWhile the Red Sox are taking a look at a bevy of infielders, including Pete Alonso, Bo Bichette and Ketel Marte, a reunion with Alex Bregman remains Boston's \"No. 1 target,\" according to The Athletic. A trade for Isaac Paredes could be a fallback option if a deal can't be reached with Bregman.\n\nHarris answered a question about Tarik Skubal's trade status, as the executive said he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't listen. Skubal has one year left on his contract, which could prompt Detroit to trade him before the season begins if the team gets a good deal.\n\nMatz is a former starter who transitioned to the bullpen last season, and found success with the Red Sox late in the year, finishing the season with a 3.05 ERA between St. Louis and Boston. Topkin adds that the deal will span two years.\n\nMegill was the best relievers on the Brewers last year, but Milwaukee is always exploring different ways to mix up its team. The Yankees have a reliever vacancy after losing Devin Williams to the Mets in free agency, but the Mets also still need to upgrade their bullpen.\n\nAccording to Rome, no deal is close, but Houston's interest in Baz is real and could be the type of move that the team prefers. Baz is coming off a season where he made a career-high 31 starts for the Rays, but still pitched to a 4.87 ERA.\n\nGore is one of several pitchers who could be traded, as the Nats look to build for the future. While Golden also reports the Red Sox and Padres explored a Gore trade at the trade deadline, he specifically names the Yankees as a team that has made a call in recent days.\n\nSuarez is one of the top relievers on the market, and the Mets, Blue Jays and Dodgers are all teams that have shown interest in improving their bullpens. Those three teams have also been linked to top closer Edwin Diaz, which makes Suarez a potential fallback option.\n\nCotillo added that other teams may be waiting for Schwarber to sign before moving on to other players. While the Phillies are believed to be the favorite to retain the DH, but the Red Sox, Mets, Reds and Pirates have all been linked to Schwarber as well.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are willing to listen on 2B Ketel Marte and are emphasizing MLB-ready starting pitchers in talks, but their asking price remains high, according to Jon Morosi. Marte has been one of the hottest names as the Winter Meetings get underway, indicating teams believe he can be had in a trade, and interested teams  reportedly include the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Mariners.\n\nThe Orioles are in on free agent starter Ranger Suarez, Jon Heyman reports. Suarez is one of the top free agent arms available, and Baltimore has been connected to starters since the offseason began.\n\nFree agent 1B Pete Alonso is heading to the Winter Meetings to meet with interested suitors, including the Red Sox and Orioles, according to the New York Post. Alonso lives a short drive away from Orlando, so he will meet in-person with interested teams.\n\nYankees GM Brian Cashman said at the Winter Meetings that the organization is \"open-minded\" but doesn't have to do as much as last winter because of the talent on the roster. \"We have really good players on this roster, and we are covered in most all areas that you need to be covered.\"\n\nThe Nationals are receiving heavy interest in SS CJ Abrams in trade talks and are open to dealing him, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon report. Washington is also talking about deals centered on SP MacKenzie Gore as the new front office looks to shake up the organization.\n\nThe Blue Jays are also among teams talking to the Diamondbacks about 2B Ketel Marte, Jon Heyman reports. The Red Sox and Mariners were reported Sunday as potential suitors for Marte, though there doesn't appear to be much traction in talks yet, Heyman reports.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have agreed to a one-year, $7.5 million deal with pitcher Michael Soroka. Soroka split the 2025 season with the Nationals and Cubs, posting a 4.87 ERA and 4.16 FIP over 16 starts with Washington before an injury limited him to 8.1 strong innings with Chicago. Soroka could function as either a starter or reliever in Arizona.\n\nDiamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte is in high demand this offseason, as a number of suitors have pursued the All-Star infielder. The Red Sox, Mariners, Pirates, Rays, Tigers and Jays are all listed as targets by New York Post's Jon Heyman.\n\nOne of the top arms available on the market, Valdez has been travelling from coast to coast, as it's reported he's visited Baltimore, New York and San Francisco. The 32-year-old lefty finished his eighth season in Houston last year with a .366 ERA.\n\nThe Pirates said they were looking to spend this offseason around Paul Skenes. How about Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber? Pittsburgh has reportedly put a four-year offer in for the free agent, while Red Sox, Cubs, Reds and others remain in the mix.\n\nThe Mariners have acquire reliever Jose Ferrer from the Nationals, in exchange for catching prospect Harry Ford and pitching prospect Isaac Lyon. The 25-year-old Ferrer has unspectacular raw numbers as a major-leaguer, but a career 3.33 FIP, impressive walk rate and high velocity make him a potential high-leverage reliever for Seattle, while Ford is a consensus top-75 prospect in baseball and could be the Nationals' catcher of the future.\n\nDespite July's firesale, the Minnesota Twins are not planning to trade Joe Ryan, Byron Buxton or Pablo Lopez this winter, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports. The Twins discussed a Ryan trade with the Boston Red Sox at the deadline but decided against dealing their young ace.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers remain \"engaged\" with teams on a potential Tarik Skubal trade, according to ESPN's Buster Olney, but they are still unsure about dealing him and have an \"enormous\" asking price. Skubal, the back-to-back reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, is set to be a free agent after the 2026 season and is reportedly far apart in extension talks with the Tigers.\n\nP Ryan Yarbrough (re-signed, 1yr/$2.5M)\n\nP Drew Anderson (1yr/$7M with $10M option for 2027)\n\nRP Kyle Finnegan (re-signed, 2yr/$19M)\n\n1B Josh Naylor (re-signed, 5yr/$92.5M)\n\nDH Kyle Schwarber (re-signed, 5yr/$150M)\n\nCL Emilio Pagan (re-signed, 2yr/$20M)\n\nC James McCann (re-signed, 1yr/$2.75M)\n\nINF Miguel Rojas (re-signed, 1yr/$5.5M)\n\nHere are the remaining free agents from SN's ranking of the top 27 free agents this winter:\n\nJapanese standouts Tatsuya Imai and Kazuma Okamoto were also posted and are available to MLB teams, making for one of the strongest-ever free agent crops of Japanese talent in one offseason.",

    "fullText": "The Mets lost closer Edwin Díaz to the reigning champions Dodgers, with the reliever agreeing to a three year, $69 million contract with Los Angeles and setting a new AAV record for relievers.\n\nThe Mets’ offer to Díaz was for three years and $66 million with some deferrals, though they expressed a willingness to improve the number.\n\nA few factors impacted the Mets’ ability to retain Díaz outside of the pure dollar amount at play.\n\nThe Dodgers’ deal with Díaz also includes some deferrals, about $4.5 million deferred per year.\n\nAnthony DiComo rounded up all the important bits of the Díaz signing and the fallout for the Mets.\n\nDevin Williams was surprised that Díaz did not return, and he expressed excitement at the opportunity to earn the closer role.\n\nDíaz wasn’t the only reliever the Mets lost, as Gregory Soto signed with the Pirates on a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nThe Mets also made an offer to Kyle Schwarber before he re-signed with Philadelphia, offering around three years and $120 million for the free agent slugger.\n\nStar free agent Pete Alonso will now take up more of the spotlight with Schwarber off the board.\n\nThe Mets are reportedly reluctant to go past three years with Alonso.\n\nAnd while the Mets remain interested in a reunion with Alonso, other options exist and remain in play for the team.\n\nDespite the blows taken by the Mets, David Stearns is still optimistic about the team’s offseason.\n\nStearns still understands why Mets fans are feeling frustrated, especially in the wake of how 2025 ended.\n\nJohn Harper wrote about whether Stearns has a plan fans should trust and what things might be other valuable parts of contract decisions other than pure player value.\n\nThe Mets are willing to listen to trade offers for All-Star starter David Peterson, though the price will be considerable.\n\nThe draft lottery was held yesterday, and because the Mets landed outside of the protected top ten picks, the Mets’ pick was docked ten spots and will be 27th overall.\n\nThe Mets and Starling Marte reportedly have mutual interest in a reunion.\n\nHaving spent years with the Mets, Tommy Tanous has been hired by the Rockies as an assistant general manager.\n\nMLB.com looked at the fallout in the wake of the Díaz and Schwarber signings, including where the Mets go from here.\n\nKyle Schwarber returned to the Phillies, agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract.\n\nHis contract is an anomaly in baseball, but Jayson Stark explained why it fits such an unique player.\n\nLeft hander Alec Gamboa and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league split contract with an invite to spring training.\n\nThe Red Sox also traded infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox landed the number one pick in the 2026 draft.\n\nAfter being traded to Detroit last season, Kyle Finnegan re-signed with the Tigers on a two-year contract worth $19 million.\n\nA Pod of Their Own was back with another episode.\n\nDecember 10th is a very busy trade day in Mets history, with three major trades taking place on this date.",
