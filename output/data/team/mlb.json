Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's only the first weekend of spring training, but Yankees vs. Mets gets the juices flowing regardless of where it falls on the calendar.\n\nThe New York rivals square off Sunday in Tampa, still knocking off a bit of rust as they ease into their Grapefruit League schedules.\n\nThe Yankees opened their home slate at Steinbrenner Field on Saturday with a rout of the Tigers sparked by a pair of Aaron Judge home runs. While the captain might not quite be in midseason form, he obviously feels good as he prepares for meaningful games earlier than normal with the World Baseball Classic looming in early March.\n\nThe Mets, on the other hand, got virtually no offense in their spring opener Saturday against the Marlins. One of their many newcomers, former Dodgers catcher Austin Barnes, got the lone hit for a Mets starter in a lineup that included Bo Bichette, Marcus Semien and Juan Soto, among others.\n\nSunday will see Luis Gil get the ball for the Yankees and Justin Hagenman for the Mets, with multiple pitchers to follow on each side.\n\nHere's everything you need to know to watch.\n\nLive streams:Fubo, Gotham Sports\n\nThe Yankees vs. Mets Grapefruit League game will be broadcast nationally by MLB Network and can be streamed via Fubo for out-of-market viewers. The game will stream live via the Gotham Sports app in the New York market.\n\nFubo offers a free trial for new subscribers, so you can try the service before you buy.

    "fullText": "In an unexpected comment, one of the best pitchers in MLB just urged the Atlanta Braves to sign nine-year veteran Lucas Giolito.\n\nDespite a 76-86 finish last year, there is legitimate excitement surrounding the Braves heading into the 2026 season. Many believe Ronald Acuna Jr. can again be an MVP candidate. They brought back impact veteran Ha-Seong Kim. Added All-Star closer Robert Suarez, and will have Spencer Strider a year further removed from UCL surgery.\n\nStrider and ace Chris Sale were set to lead a rotation that had the potential to be one of the very best in the league. However, that group took massive hits over the last week. Both Hurston Waldrep and Spencer Schwellenbach are expected to miss much of the 2026 season due to surgeries on their pitching elbows.\n\nWhile the Braves still have solid pitching depth, they’ve been looking at the free agent market for potential options to fill Waldrep and Schwellenback’s spots in the rotation. One player that has been linked to Atlanta is one-time All-Star Lucas Giolito.\n\nThe 31-year-old had a good season for the Boston Red Sox in 2025 after missing all of 2024 following Tommy John surgery. Yet, for some reason, he remains a free agent with spring training a week old for teams around the league.\n\nWell, his 2025 teammate Garret Crochet believes that should end, and claimed this week that the Braves are a “pretty obvious” place he should land.\n\n“It just doesn’t make a ton of sense. It’s just been that way for a while, though,” Crochet told the media on Saturday when asked about Giolito still being available. “The middle of the market on both the position player and pitching side kind of gets screwed and ends up either signing after the season begins or what have you.”\n\n“… A lot of guys never figure it out here. The guys that have, they’ve stayed around, in the past, for a reason. I don’t think that just because we’re getting super analytical, we should look at it any differently,” he added. “When you look at depth, you’re looking at guys who are experienced and have done it, not guys who can do it. That’s not depth. That’s just another prospect.”\n\nGiolito went 10-4 with a 3.41 ERA and fanned 121 batters in 145 innings last season.\n\nBlue Jays & Max Scherzer Getting ‘Serious’ in Talks\n\nReport Reveals Juan Soto Delivered Record Revenue for NY Mets in Debut Season\n\nBest MLB Shortstops 2026: 10 Best Shortstops in MLB Right Now",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers begin Cactus League play on Saturday, but early spring training action on Friday showed a high-profile free agent already making an impact at his new home. There were also updates about two pitchers on either side of Tommy John surgery.\n\nPete Alonso seems to be settling in nicely in Baltimore after leaving the New York Mets in free agency.\n\nAlonso, who signed a five year, $155 million contract with the Orioles late last year, blasted a two-run home run in the team’s spring training matchup with the Yankees.\n\nOrioles manager Craig Albernaz said Alonso asked for the third at-bat that resulted in the bomb, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\n“He wanted it, and he made the most of it,” Albernaz said. “It speaks a lot. Pete just wants to play.”\n\nAs reported by Chris Kirschner of The Athletic, Gerrit Cole wowed his teammates in his first live batting practice since Tommy John surgery.\n\nCole hit 97 mph with some pitches and managed to strike out one of the three batters he faced.\n\nYankees superstar Aaron Judge, who grounded out off a Cole pitch during the brief session, said his teammate again looked like the great pitcher who won the 2003 American League Cy Young Award.\n\n“Gerrit looked great,” Judge said. “Excited to see him back on the mound. That was the most important thing. The stuff is still electric.\n\nFull AB: Trent Grisham strikes out on a 95 mph fastball from Gerrit Cole pic.twitter.com/nh5TFcJYZQ\n\n— Chris Kirschner (@ChrisKirschner) February 20, 2026\n\nOn the other end of the Tommy John spectrum, Pablo Lopez will indeed have to undergo the procedure after tearing his ulnar collateral ligament.\n\nThe tear was reported earlier this week, though the details of the procedure have now been confirmed.\n\n“The team said Friday that López’s surgery will be performed next week in Texas by Rangers team physician Dr. Keith Meister,” the Associated Press reports. “López turns 30 early next month.”\n\nLopez missed significant time last season with injuries, but he still posted a 2.74 ERA in 14 starts.\n\nHe will also miss pitching for Team Venezuela in the upcoming World Baseball Classic.",

    "fullText": "Happy Thursday, Dodgers fans. Cactus League play is just around the corner for the Boys in Blue.\n\nAs we await the joy of getting to see World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto return to the mound on Saturday, here are some of the top headlines from around Major League Baseball.\n\nThe reigning back-to-back National League manager of the year was rewarded by the team on Thursday.\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers gave Pat Murphy a three-year extension, ESPN reports.\n\nIn addition to the three years — 2026 through 2028 — the deal also includes a club option for 2029, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reports.\n\nThe trial of Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, who are accused of tipping pitches to bettors in exchange for kickbacks, is likely to move to the fall, Zack Meisel of The Athletic reports.\n\nBoth have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail, though they are on the MLB’s restricted list.\n\nThey were scheduled to have their trial begin in May, though Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto “suggested she’ll ultimately shift the date to the fall,” Meisel wrote.\n\nThose involved were ordered to submit their preferred new trial date by Monday.\n\nIf October is indeed the new trial date, it will be interesting to see if the legal proceedings overlap with the World Series.\n\nInfielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. has made public his intentions to join Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani in an exclusive club that was empty until last season and now only includes the Japanese two-way player.\n\nChisholm told Chris Kirschner of The Athletic that he wants to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a season, which was done for the first time in history by Ohtani just last year.\n\n“Reminded that 50-50 has been accomplished just once in MLB history, he shrugged,” Kirschner wrote. “’You’re looking at the second one,’ Chisholm said.”\n\nThe quest may seem nearly impossible, but Yankees teammate Aaron Judge expressed confidence to Kirschner.\n\n“He really can accomplish anything,” Judge said.",

    "fullText": "In Major League Baseball, franchise value reflects far more than wins and losses — it represents legacy, market influence, brand power, and the emotional investment of generations of fans. According to Forbes, the sport’s most valuable teams are not just successful organizations but enduring cultural institutions that shape how baseball is experienced across the country and around the world. Leading the way are iconic brands like the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers, whose global reach and financial strength mirror their long-standing competitive prominence. Close behind, franchises such as the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs prove that deep-rooted history and passionate fan loyalty can translate into extraordinary economic value. Meanwhile, the San Francisco Giants showcase how sustained success in the modern era can elevate a franchise’s stature both competitively and commercially.\n\nWhat unites these teams is their ability to transcend the game itself. Each operates as a powerful entertainment brand, drawing massive attendance, commanding lucrative media deals, and maintaining devoted followings that span generations. Their ballparks are destinations, their histories are woven into the fabric of their cities, and their influence stretches well beyond regional markets. In many ways, these franchises serve as pillars of baseball’s identity — setting financial benchmarks while carrying the traditions that keep the sport deeply connected to its past.\n\nFranchise value: $8.2B\nFew brands in sports carry the global recognition of the Yankees. Their history is stacked with championships, legends, and iconic moments that shaped baseball itself. The franchise thrives on tradition, star power, and unmatched cultural visibility. Whether contending or rebuilding, they remain baseball’s financial and symbolic powerhouse.\n\nFranchise value: $6.8B\nThe Dodgers blend historic prestige with modern dominance better than almost anyone. Their massive fan base stretches across Southern California and well beyond, fueled by consistent winning and aggressive investment in talent. The franchise excels both on the field and at the gate, drawing huge attendance year after year. They represent the blueprint for a contemporary big-market contender.\n\nFranchise value: $4.8B\nThe Red Sox carry one of baseball’s most emotionally charged legacies, rooted deeply in Boston’s identity. From the drama of historic droughts to the euphoria of multiple modern titles, the team lives at the center of passionate fandom. Fenway Park’s atmosphere alone is part of their brand value. Their history, rivalry, and regional loyalty make them perpetually relevant.\n\nFranchise value: $4.6B\nThe Cubs transformed from lovable underdogs into a global brand, especially after their long-awaited championship breakthrough. Wrigley Field’s charm and neighborhood feel give the franchise a timeless appeal. Generations of fans stayed loyal through decades of heartbreak, strengthening the team’s cultural footprint. Today, they balance nostalgia with modern competitiveness.\n\nFranchise value: $4.0B\nThe Giants built a 21st-century dynasty that elevated their national profile and market value. Their waterfront ballpark and strong regional following make them a cornerstone of West Coast baseball. Success across multiple championship runs reinforced their reputation for smart roster construction and stability. They embody sustained excellence with a distinctly San Francisco identity.\n\nTogether, these franchises represent the gold standard of value in Major League Baseball — where heritage, market strength, and sustained relevance intersect. Their financial dominance reflects decades of cultural impact, smart organizational leadership, and unwavering fan devotion. As the sport continues to evolve, these teams remain defining forces, proving that true franchise value is built not just on performance, but on legacy that endures across generations.\n\nOLYMPICS: USA figure skater Isabeau Levito gushes over Olympic Village\n\nNFL: Tyreek Hill makes hilarious first move after Dolphins release\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 after Week 15\n\nMLB: Tigers infielder from Taiwan apologizes to Koreans after trash talk goes viral\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: College Hall of Famer, father of Chicago Bulls coach, dies\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post Most valuable franchises in MLB appeared first on The Big Lead.",

The team has more pitching than it knows what to do with.\n\nDan Plesac, a three-time All-Star who pitched two seasons for the Pirates in the mid-1990s, is particularly impressed by Pittsburgh’s starting rotation. He likes it so much that he recently compared it to a famous National League dynasty on MLB Network.\n\n“It’s a very good rotation,” Plesac said on Tuesday’s episode of MLB Tonight. “It reminds me a little bit going back, and this might be a little bit of an overstatement, of some of those young pitching staffs of the Atlanta Braves before we knew who they were.”\n\n\"If I'm a Pirates fan, this is the most enthusiastic I've felt going into a season in about four or five years.\"\n\n– @Plesac19 on #MLBTonight https://t.co/BEEXZ98zzg pic.twitter.com/mAe7uQbJKy\n\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) February 18, 2026\n\nPlesac is referring to the legendary Braves of the early 1990s with Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Steve Avery.\n\nThat might be a bit of a reach, but Skenes is certainly on that level and Chandler has the potential to be.\n\nThose iconic Atlanta teams ruled the 1990s and won a World Series, so that’s an exciting comparison for the Pirates, who haven’t won a playoff game since 2013 or a championship since 1979.\n\nHowever, that could be about to change. Not only does Pittsburgh have excellent pitching, but it also dramatically improved its lineup over the offseason.\n\n“It’s a team that’s built around their starting pitching, make no bones about it,” Plesac added. “If I’m a Pirates fan, this is the most enthusiastic I’ve felt going into a season in about four or five years.”\n\nMore Pirates: Former All-Star Pitcher Reveals What He Loves About Pirates’ Bubba Chandler\n\nThe post MLB Analyst Compares Pirates’ Loaded Pitching Staff To Recent Dynasty appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "One day after Tony Clark's surprise resignation amid a reported inappropriate relationship with his sister-in-law, the Major League Baseball Players Association elected Bruce Meyer as its executive director, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.\n\nThe vote was reportedly unanimous, with Meyer receiving the job on an interim basis after previously serving as deputy executive director.\n\nMeyer was the natural choice as Clark's No. 2 and the union's lead negotiator with MLB. He spoke earlier Wednesday about the importance of the union remaining united in the wake of Clark's ouster.\n\nAccording to Passan, Clark resigned on the heels of an internal investigation, which revealed an inappropriate relationship with his sister-in-law, who worked for the union beginning in 2023. The union held an emergency meeting Tuesday afternoon, but did not vote on an executive director until Wednesday.\n\nThe news comes less than a year before the current CBA is set to expire on Dec. 1. The union and MLB owners are expected to engage in a furious labor battle ahead of the new CBA, which many expect could lead to a lockout ahead of the 2027 MLB season. There is speculation the owners will push hard for a salary cap, something the players have opposed for years.\n\nMeyer joined the MLBPA in 2018 and played a central role in the last CBA negotiation. This election confirms he'll indeed be at the table for the upcoming negotiation.\n\nClark played a major role in helping negotiate previous CBAs for the players. He reportedly took an active part in negotiations as a player before being hired by the MLBPA in 2010. He was initially a director of player relations before being hired as the union's executive director in 2013. He oversaw negotiations ahead of the 2016 CBA and the contentious 2022 lockout, which resulted in Opening Day being postponed by a week as negotiations extended into March.",

    "fullText": "Spring training is rolling on in Major League Baseball, though many stars will depart camp early to join their teams for the World Baseball Classic.\n\nHere are some top headlines from around the MLB, including the Houston Astros targeting a pair of former Dodgers and the fallout from the MLB Players Association’s executive director’s surprise resignation.\n\nCavan Biggio, son of Astros great and Hall of Famer Craig Biggio, was signed to a minor league deal by the team, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe younger Biggio was a Dodger for part of 2024, appearing in 30 games and slashing .192/.306/.329.\n\nThe utility man has spent seven years in the majors as part of four teams.\n\nMichael Conforto, who spent 2025 with the Dodgers but had the worst season of his career, has also drawn interest from the Astros, according to Brian McTaggart of MLB.com.\n\nThe Houston Astros have reportedly showed interest in signing Michael Conforto, who still remains a free agent at the beginning of Spring Training.\n\nConforto is coming off a disappointing season with the Dodgers and is 32-years-old. pic.twitter.com/dUQx20cXcC\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) February 18, 2026\n\nDuring his year in LA, Conforto slashed .199/.305/.333 in 138 games.\n\nHe hit 12 home runs and knocked in 36 runs as well.\n\nConforto slashed .237/.309/.450 with 20 home runs and 66 RBIs for the San Francisco Giants in 2024.\n\nHe’d been on a one-year, $17 million deal with the Dodgers, but the Boys in Blue filled that hole in the outfield with Kyle Tucker, perhaps the top free agent of the offseason.\n\nFollowing the shocking resignation of Tony Clark, who’d been having an “inappropriate relationship” with his sister-in-law, deputy executive director Bruce Meyer projected strength on Wednesday.\n\n“I’m not going to say this is a great thing; this is unforeseen,” he said, as reported by Jesse Rogers of ESPN. “At the end of the day, leadership is important and leadership comes and goes, but what remains is the players.\n\n“Our union is strong and always has been strong because of the solidarity of our members, of our players. That is going to continue, and as I’ve said in the past in different contexts, anybody who underestimates the strength of the MLB Players Association does so at their own peril.”",

    "description": "In a unanimous vote, the MLB Players Association has selected Bruce Meyer to be its interim leader.",
    "fullText": "PHOENIX — Bruce Meyer, the tenacious veteran litigator who has been the Major League Baseball Player Association’s lead negotiator, was voted unanimously Wednesday by the players to be their interim executive director, replacing Tony Clark.\n\nMeyer, who was promoted to be the union’s deputy executive director in 2022, has been MLB’s public enemy since he joined the union in 2018. He frequently has clashed on even small agenda items with MLB, which has accused him of being bad for baseball.\n\nMeyer is considered the union’s most fierce litigator since the days of Don Fehr and Gene Orza, and once again Wednesday expressed his deep resentment towards MLB’s hopes for a salary cap, believing that a lockout Dec. 1 is inevitable when the collective bargaining agreement expires.\n\n“A lockout is all but guaranteed at the end of the agreement,’’ Meyer said Wednesday afternoon after meeting with the Chicago Cubs, and spending the morning with the Kansas City Royals. “The league has pretty much said that. Their strategy in bargaining has always been to put as much pressure on players as they can to try and create divisions and cracks among our membership.\n\n“It never worked. I don’t think it will ever work.’’\n\nMeyer, who said he will continue to be the lead negotiator, said that he and his staff have a duty to the players to listen to whatever MLB offers, but showed his disdain towards even entertaining a salary cap.\n\n“Our position and the historic position of this union for decades on the salary cap is well known,’’ Meyer said. “It’s the ultimate restriction. It is something that owners in all the sports have wanted more than anything, and in baseball in particular. There’s a reason for that, because it’s good for them and not the players.’’\n\nMeyer, even with the sudden resignation of Clark over an inappropriate relationship with a union employee, insisted Wednesday morning there is no disarray among the union ranks, and its resolve remains strong.\n\n“I think anybody who's going to assume that and act on that,’’ Meyer said, “is really making a mistake. I'm not going to say (the timing of Clark’s resignation) is a great thing. This is unforeseen. There have been some issues hanging over (him), and in some respects, it's good to get them out of the way sooner rather than later.’’\n\nMeyer, while respected for his fierceness, does have his detractors. There was an attempt to remove him from the office two years ago, an effort led by attorney Harry Marino, who organized the efforts to have minor leaguers unionized. It failed when Clark came to Meyer’s defense.\n\nThe eight-person executive subcommittee pushed for Meyer to be voted as the executive director in their meeting Tuesday, but after pushback by at last three players on the call, no vote was taken. The group of 72 players, including player representatives from 30 teams, decided to reconvene at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday after polling their own teammates. If Meyer didn’t receive enough support, they likely would have turned to Matt Nussbaum, the union’s general counsel.\n\nNow, Meyer will be running the whole show, much to MLB’s fear thanks to past negotiations.\n\nWhen the 99-day lockout ended in 2022, and the rank-and-file voted to accept MLB’s last proposal, Meyer sympathized with the executive council who wanted to continue negotiations, even if it meant losing games.\n\n“Some players emerged from bargaining disappointed that we did not accomplish more,’’ Meyer said in a letter to players two years ago, “and in particular that we did not miss games to see if more gains could be made. To be clear, I sympathized and still do with these players and this position.’’\n\nMeyer, who becomes the seventh executive director of the union, expects negotiations with MLB to begin in April on the next CBA, and just like the last round, tranquility will not be on anyone’s bingo card.\n\n“I'd say I'm known as a tough litigator who also knows how to make deals when necessary,’’ Meyer said in a Q&A with the MLBPA newsletter. “In the sports area I've been involved in just about every type of issue, including labor, antitrust, licensing, collective bargaining and others. But the common thread is I have a passion for player advocacy and defending player rights.’’\n\nLet the negotiations, with plenty of rancor, begin.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: MLBPA selects Bruce Meyer as interim boss after Tony Clark resignation",

    "fullText": "In today’s financial landscape of Major League Baseball, record-setting contracts aren’t just about reward — they’re statements about impact, durability, and the evolving definition of elite performance. The highest-paid players in the sport represent more than statistical production; they embody the traits organizations believe can shape competitive windows, anchor rosters, and deliver sustained excellence over time. This particular group reflects a fascinating cross-section of modern baseball value: generational versatility, advanced hitting intelligence, dynamic offensive energy, and frontline pitching stability.\n\nAt the top end, the sport is witnessing unprecedented investment in players who fundamentally change how the game is played or how teams are built around them. Whether it’s redefining positional expectations, controlling the strike zone with rare precision, or serving as a lineup’s emotional and strategic centerpiece, these athletes influence far more than the box score. Their skill sets force opponents to adjust game plans, alter pitching strategies, and rethink defensive positioning on a nightly basis.\n\nEqually important is the diversity of excellence represented here. Some players dominate through explosive offensive production and relentless pressure on defenses, while others establish their value through consistency, durability, and the ability to perform in the sport’s most demanding moments. These contracts signal a clear industry reality: teams are willing to invest heavily in players who combine performance, reliability, and transformational presence. In many ways, this list reflects how baseball increasingly rewards players who don’t just contribute — they fundamentally shift competitive balance.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $70M \nOhtani is baseball’s ultimate unicorn — a true two-way superstar who dominates both on the mound and at the plate. His rare skill set reshapes how teams think about roster construction and value. Beyond the stats, he carries global star power that transcends the sport. Simply put, he’s redefining what a modern baseball icon looks like.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $60M\nTucker blends elite power, disciplined hitting, and smooth defense into one complete package. He’s become a central offensive engine and a consistent run producer in high-pressure moments. Quietly efficient but extremely impactful, he does the small things that win games. His steady rise reflects both production and long-term trust from his organization.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $51M \nSoto is one of the most advanced hitters of his generation, known for extraordinary plate discipline and clutch power. His command of the strike zone feels almost surgical, forcing pitchers to adjust to him rather than the other way around. He brings swagger, patience, and big-moment confidence to every at-bat. Teams pay a premium for hitters who can control games without swinging wildly — and that’s Soto’s specialty.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $42M \nBichette plays with an energetic, attacking style that keeps pressure on opposing defenses. He’s a dynamic offensive catalyst who consistently produces extra-base hits and drives scoring rallies. His intensity and confidence help set the tone for his lineup. When he’s locked in, he brings a spark that changes the rhythm of a game.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $42M \nWheeler has built his reputation on power pitching and relentless consistency. His fastball command and deep-game durability make him a true workhorse in an era of specialized bullpens. He thrives in high-leverage situations where poise matters as much as velocity. Teams value pitchers who anchor rotations — and Wheeler does exactly that.\n\nTogether, these five contracts capture the modern blueprint for baseball’s most valuable assets: versatility, precision, consistency, and game-changing presence. Each player represents a different pathway to elite status, yet all command premium investment because of the tangible advantage they provide. As salaries continue to climb, lists like this reveal not just who excels today — but what the sport believes winning will require tomorrow.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 17\n\nNFL: Tyreek Hill makes hilarious first move after Dolphins release\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 after Week 15\n\nMLB: Tigers infielder from Taiwan apologizes to Koreans after trash talk goes viral\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: College Hall of Famer, father of Chicago Bulls coach, dies\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post Top 5 highest paid athletes across MLB appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nShohei Ohtani is already ahead of last year.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way superstar is already the best baseball player on the planet, and maybe ever. He's already a two-time World Series champion in two seasons with the Dodgers, too.\n\nAnd now, another reason for baseball to be scared.\n\nTwo seasons ago, Ohtani didn't pitch at all for the Dodgers as he recovered from Tommy John surgery.\n\nLast season, Ohtani had to ramp up slowly as he worked back into pitching in MLB games again.\n\nThis time around, Ohtani is already throwing at spring training.\n\n\"To see him face hitters, kind of start his buildup -- he’s certainly way ahead of where he was last year on the pitching side.

    "fullText": "Reactions from the first day and weekend of Division-1 baseball can stick in the minds of scouts throughout the entirety of the spring. One singular game of 55 can be a mental staple despite the reality that it has no more important than the next game.\n\nIn this edition of The Sporting Tribune's bi-weekly draft notebook, we take a look at the most notable performances from the opening weekend of Divison-1 baseball, and what we saw over the weekend. Things that may stick with us through the entirety of the spring.\n\nUtah Tech 2B Kyle McDaniel reached base 11(!) times in three games to start the weekend (7-10, 4 BB); super unorthodox but feel to make contact is evident pic.twitter.com/ml7IFQtqIa\n\n— Taylor Blake Ward (@TaylorBlakeWard) February 15, 2026\n\nOne of the better hitters in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), McDaniel proved his hitting prowess with one of the better early season performances against UC Riverside. Over four games against the Highlanders, he reached base safely in 15-of-21 plate appearances with zero strikeouts (8-for-14, six walks, one hit-by-pitch, double).\n\nWith an unorthodox setup and slap-and-dash swing from the left side and limited defensive versatility at second base, McDaniel may not jump to the top of boards through the spring, but his track record of hitting will propel him into early second day talk with a projected draft stock of rounds 4-7.\n\nSeen as one of the top pitchers in the 2026 draft class, Flora had one of the loudest performances across all of D1 on Friday when he ended the first inning with a 100-mph fastball with 21 inches of induced vertical break -- an uncommon shape for a fastball with that type of velocity.\n\nFlora struck out five Southern Miss hitters over six scoreless innings with no walks, three hits allowed and three batters hit. While the triple-digit moment was the standout moment, Flora held upper 90's velocity throughout the outing. Paired with his strike-throwing and pair of off-speed offering (sweeper, changeup) that both flash plus, he looks poised to be one of the top arms off the board come July -- if not the top arm in the class.\n\nMason Edwards strikes out the order, brings his total to 7 k’s in 4.0 innings across 65 pitches. pic.twitter.com/uNQDVwopyx\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nUSC left-handed pitcher Mason Edwards made a strong statement as the Trojans’ Friday night starter. He struck out nine of the 15 batters he faced across five scoreless innings, allowing just one hit and two walks on an efficient 78 pitches.\n\nEdwin So - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUSC Trojan pitcher Mason Edwards (30) throws a pitch during an NCAA Men's baseball game between the USC Trojans and Pepperdine Wave Friday February 13,2026 at Dedeaux Field in Los Angeles Calif\n\nEdwards’ fastball sat 92–93 mph and topped out at 94, a slight dip from earlier reports, but he showed excellent command of the pitch throughout the outing. His slurve was particularly effective, generating the majority of his strikeouts and keeping hitters off balance.\n\nMason Edwards continuing to show good command with his SLV, gets third strikeout using his fastball, still sitting at 92-93, topping out at 94 in the 2nd inning across 40 pitches. pic.twitter.com/tI029inAeY\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nWith South Carolina left-hander Jake McCoy sidelined due to a preseason arm injury, Edwards has positioned himself as a potential frontrunner to be the top college left-hander in the 2026 draft class, especially if his velocity ticks back up over his next few starts.\n\nUSC infielder Adrian Lopez had a strong Opening Day performance, going 1-for-2 with a double and a walk. He displayed solid plate discipline, consistently avoiding chase pitches and showing mature swing decisions throughout his at-bats.\n\nAdrian Lopez, in his 2nd AB double off the wall. pic.twitter.com/Z9N3SjxdRk\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nLopez made the start at third base after playing first base for the Trojans last season. Defensively, he demonstrated a quick first step and good reactions on most balls hit his way, though his arm strength appeared average.\n\nAdrian Lopez at 3rd base, looking good with the with some grabs so far. Walked in his first at bat. pic.twitter.com/xS01QS9XAh\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nOver the weekend, Lopez finished 2-for-9 with two doubles, two walks, and a hit-by-pitch, and one fielding error.\n\nStanding out as one of the best starting pitchers in the Western Athletic Conference, the senior's season debut was cut short after 2.2 inning when he exited the game due to some discomfort, which head coach Gary Adcock said was nothing serious, but also not worth pushing through so early in the season.\n\nSteven Park - The Sporting Tribune\n\nCBU Lancers pitcher Cody New (21) pitches during an NCAA Baseball game against the CSUF Titans on February 13, 2026 in Fullerton, California.\n\nNew struck out three Cal State Fullerton batters while allowing three hits and two walks.  New's four-seem sits around 93-94 MPH and he struggles to locate it at the top of the zone. His real standout pitches are his curveball and slider.\n\nCal Baptist LHP Cody New allowed three hits and two walks in 2.2 IP against CSUF with three K’s\n\nFB sat around 93-94 MPH and his curve between 77-80. Struggled with command at times, but his curveball has elite movement, esp. against RHH.\n\n⁦⁦⁦@TaylorBlakeWard⁩ pic.twitter.com/g02GMxirFQ\n\n— Jack Haslett (@JackHaslett_13) February 14, 2026\n\nNew's slider sits around 80 MPH and also has wicked movement that makes it unreachable for most right handed batters, while his curve ranges between 77-81 MPH, with great lateral movement and drop to elicit swings-and-misses and generate the majority of his strikeouts.\n\nSteven Park - The Sporting Tribune\n\nCSUF Titans pitcher Mikiah Negrete (4) pitches during an NCAA Baseball game against the CBU Lancers on February 13, 2026 in Fullerton, California.\n\nThe Titan's senior ace started the season strong against Cal Baptist by striking out four while allowing three hits in 5.0 innings of work.\n\nNegrete's fastball hovers in the low 90's but he shows impressive command with both his curveball, which sits around 83 MPH and features effective vertical drop, and his changeup that sits right at 80 MPH.

The only other time he reached base was in the third inning when he reached on a fielder's choice. Despite having one hit, he showed tremendous patience at the plate, working the count all the way to the top, and had a walk in the fourth inning.\n\nRoch Cholowsky has shown a lot of patience tonight and just had his first walk of the evening on a 6 pitch at bat.

Now, with the offseason winding down, they could make one more move to make sure they are guaranteed to three-peat.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Mark Powell and Wynston Wilcox, that move is trading for Minnesota Twins two-time All-Star and Wilson Overall Defensive Player of the Year Byron Buxton.

They could use an upgrade on the corners in the outfield so this makes sense. And if you want to stay atop of MLB, the best way to do it is to have a bulletproof lineup. Adding Buxton just improves the bottom of their order. The only dangerous team is one that has a reputable batter, one through nine,” Powell and Wilcox wrote.\n\nThis past season, Buxton slashed .264/.327/.551/.878 with 21 doubles, 35 home runs, and 83 RBI in 126 games played. He would replace Andy Pages in the outfield, and would bring more power and a better glove as well.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Yankees trade sees New York land $330 million two-time MVP to create superstar outfield trio with Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger\n\nHe’s also incredibly cheap by the Dodgers’ standards.

    "description": "New York Mets owner Steve Cohen may have lost out on the Kyle Tucker sweepstakes, but he isn't backing down from spending big on high-level free agents.",
    "fullText": "New York Mets owner Steve Cohen may have lost out on the Kyle Tucker sweepstakes, but he isn’t backing down from spending big on high-level free agents.\n\nAnthony DiComo, Mets beat writer for MLB.com, quoted Cohen admitting the Los Angeles Dodgers have built a high-level franchise, but he indicated he’s not intimidated.\n\n“They’re formidable,” DiComo shared on social media. “They have the ability to spend. So do I, by the way.”\n\nThe Dodgers have taken some criticism in recent years over their spending to acquire big-name free agents like Shohei Ohtani and Tucker.\n\nThe $240 million contract for Tucker in particular has renewed interest in a possible salary cap in Major League Baseball, which is the only major North American sports league without one.\n\nCohen has admitted he wanted to sign Tucker this offseason and was “annoyed” the team failed to land the prized outfielder.\n\nThe Mets also lost closer Edwin Díaz to the Dodgers, though they were able to sign infielder Bo Bichette, whom the Dodgers had targeted.\n\nIn an interview with Mets broadcaster Howie Rose, Cohen has made the case that the team ultimately is better off with Bichette over Tucker.\n\n“Frankly, once it was all done, and we got Bo to come to the Mets, (I) actually feel Bo might be a better fit for the team,” said Cohen, as reported by Tim Britton for The Athletic. “So I think things worked out for the best.”\n\nWhile fans and owners of other teams might feel like the Dodgers are bad for baseball, current players — even those who face off against the Boys in Blue regularly — love what the team is doing.\n\n“I f—ing love it,” San Diego Padre and former Dodger Manny Machado said of the Dodgers’ spending. “Every team should be doing it. …S— is f—ing great for the game. So I think every team has the ability to do it, so I hope all 30 teams can learn from that.”\n\nBryce Harper of the Philadelphia Phillies echoed that sentiment.\n\n“I love what the Dodgers do, obviously,” Harper said. “They pay the money, they spend the money. I mean, they’re a great team. They understand how to run it. They run their team like a business, and they run it the right way. They understand where they need to put their money into.”",

    "fullText": "Few stories in recent baseball history have been as unexpected or captivating as the one unfolding around Joey Gallo, the veteran slugger and former star who’s attempting a comeback to the big leagues in a role few envisioned: as a pitcher.\n\nGallo, a two-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner best known for his prodigious power and towering home runs over a decade-long MLB career, is taking an unconventional path back to baseball’s highest level. After struggling as a hitter late in his career and bouncing between several teams, he has turned his focus to the mound in hopes of carving out a new chapter for himself in 2026.\n\nMORE: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDrafted by the Texas Rangers in 2012, Gallo built a reputation as one of the game’s most feared home-run hitters, posting back-to-back 40-plus homer seasons in 2017 and 2018. But his offensive contributions came with a high cost: Gallo struck out at one of the highest rates in baseball and finished his career with a batting average well below the league average.\n\nAs his defensive versatility diminished and offensive struggles mounted, he cycled through the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, Minnesota Twins, and Washington Nationals before hitting free agency.\n\nIn 2025, Gallo signed a minor-league deal with the Chicago White Sox, only to be released after he revealed his intention to transition to pitching — a move that stunned fans and analysts alike but also showed his determination to stay in the game.\n\nOne of the key reasons teams have taken note of Gallo’s transformation is his incredible arm strength. Throughout his career as an outfielder, he consistently ranked among the hardest throwers in MLB. His outfield throws clocked in the mid-90s and were well above average. That raw arm talent provides a foundation for his attempt to become a pitcher. That is something very few position players ever contemplate at the major-league level.\n\nSince announcing his intentions to switch roles, Gallo has been working on his delivery, mechanics, and pitch development. He has posted videos of bullpen sessions and workouts on social media, showcasing not just arm strength but a willingness to retool his entire approach to the game.\n\nWhat once seemed like an off-the-wall experiment has slowly gained traction. Reports from MLB insiders indicate that multiple teams have shown legitimate interest in evaluating Gallo on the mound. With spring training workouts already underway, Gallo has begun throwing for interested clubs in Florida. Scouts are watching closely to see how his pitches — reportedly reaching into the low-to-mid-90s — play in live settings.\n\nThis kind of curiosity isn’t unprecedented — former hitters like Anthony Gose and Tyler Naquin have pursued pitching conversions. There have been varying degrees of success in recent years, of course. Gallo’s case is still remarkable because of how firmly established he was as a slugger.\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Former MLB all-star hitter is attempting a comeback as a pitcher appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Manfred said there are still issues to resolve with the Major League Baseball Players Association before those Olympic aspirations are a reality.",
    "fullText": "PALM BEACH, Fla. — Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred is optimistic that major leaguers will play in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nManfred, speaking following an owners meeting Thursday, said there are still issues to resolve with the Major League Baseball Players Association before those Olympic aspirations are a reality, but “I think we’re a lot closer to there than we were the last time we talked about it,” he said.\n\nThe six-nation baseball tournament will be played from July 13-19 at Dodger Stadium. MLB is planning for an extended All-Star break between July 9 and July 21, with the All-Star Game likely at San Francisco on July 11.\n\nAn agreement with the union is needed.\n\n“I sense a lot of momentum towards playing in LA in 2028,” Manfred said. “I think we are going to get over those issues. I think people have come to appreciate that the Olympics on U.S. soil is a unique marketing opportunity for the game. I think we had a lot of players interested in doing it and, you know, I feel pretty good about the idea (that) we’ll get there.”\n\nIn addition, an agreement is needed on insurance to cover player contracts for time with Olympic teams.\n\nThe United States will have an automatic berth in the both the baseball and softball tournaments and the top two other nations from the Americas in next month’s World Baseball Classic will earn berths.\n\nMLB did not allow players on 40-man rosters to participate in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, when Nippon Professional Baseball interrupted its season and Japan beat the U.S. 2-0 in the gold medal game.\n\nManfred was also asked if the involvement of Casey Wasserman, the prominent businessman and talent agent who has recently lost clients because of his appearance in recently released government files on Jeffrey Epstein, would deter the league from participating in the Olympics. He declined to comment on Wasserman, who is the chairman of the Los Angeles games, saying, “Look, our dealings are not with Casey. Our dealings are with the institution of the Olympics.”\n\nThe addition of star outfielder Kyle Tucker by the Los Angeles Dodgers to what already was among the highest payrolls again sparked debate over whether management will propose a salary cap in collective bargaining this year.\n\nManfred said there hasn’t been much movement in salary cap talks.\n\nTucker, the right fielder who is considered one of the best players in baseball, is the latest accomplished veteran brought in by the Dodgers, who have three of the top eight current contracts by average annual value. Los Angeles also signed top closer Edwin Díaz to bolster its bullpen.\n\n“Look, I think great teams are always good for baseball,” he said. “I think with respect to this particular great team, it added to what we have been hearing from fans in a lot of markets for a long time about the competitiveness of the game. But great teams are always good baseball.”\n\nBargaining is likely to start this spring on a labor contract to succeed the deal that expires Dec. 1.\n\n“We’re in the preparation process,” Manfred said. “We haven’t agreed on a calendar with the MLBPA and it does take two to tango, as they say, but historically after opening day we kind of get started.”\n\nManfred said there likely isn’t a way around insurance issues that have come up for MLB-contracted players planning to play in next month’s World Baseball Classic. Several stars, including Puerto Rico’s Francisco Lindor and Carlos Correa, were left off their countries’ rosters because the WBC insurer wouldn’t cover them.\n\n“We like that, when they say they want to play, obviously,” Manfred said. “But then to have a problem with the insurance and the guy being unable to play, we recognize that. I’m just not sure that there is a way around it.”\n\nThe tournament is co-owned by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association. Insurance is provided by National Financial Partners.\n\n“In order to get clubs comfortable with the idea that guys should play earlier in games they otherwise would not play, we had to protect them financially,” Manfred said.\n\nOwners approved a rules change requiring first- and third-base coaches to remain in the marked coaching boxes. Coaches have frequently moved toward home plate, in a better position to better relay signs from the defensive team that may pick up.\n\nMLB will produce and distribute local television broadcasts of at least 14 teams this season following financial problems of Main Street Sports Group’s FanDuel Sports Network.\n\n“The RSN situation has an impact on our revenue growth because the decline there is a drag on what is otherwise a growing industry,” Manfred said. “It is true that the smaller markets have been hit harder than the larger markets, which impacts revenue sharing. Having said both of those, I think longer term, our content is inherently valuable. We deliver tons of eyeballs, and I think when we have an opportunity to get to market in 2028, we’re going to be just fine.”\n\nManfred said the 14 teams are “probably making a little less than they made under their old contracts.”\n\n“The key word there is old,” he added. “The reason those contracts aren’t there anymore was they were not economic given the cord-cutting that’s going on.”\n\nTeams approved two changes in controlling owners: Cincinnati Reds CEO Phil Castellini succeeds his father Minnesota Twins board member Tom Pohlad takes over from takes over from his younger brother Bob.\n\nManfred said of the San Diego Padres’ sale process: “There is robust interest in what is viewed as a really appealing asset.”\n\nMilwaukee chairman Mark Attanasio and Baltimore control owner David Rubenstein were voted to the eight-man executive council, replacing Arizona managing general partner Ken Kendrick and Seattle chairman John Stanton. The council also includes San Francisco chairman Greg Johnson and Cleveland chairman Paul Dolan (whose terms expire in 2027) and Miami chairman Bruce Sherman and Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno (2028) and New York Mets chairman Steve Cohen and Athletics managing partner John Fisher (2029).\n\nMLB approved extensions of its contract with Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. and of the deals for Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. to carry the Extra Innings package of out-of-market TV broadcasts.",

    "title": "MLB owners crack down on pitch stealing with new rule aimed at first- and third-base coaches",
    "description": "Pitch stealing is allowed as long as players and coaches don't use in-game technology to steal signs.",
    "fullText": "MLB owners want to make it harder for teams to engage in pitch-stealing tactics on the field. Team owners reportedly voted to approve a rule Thursday that would prevent first- and third-base coaches from leaving their coaches' boxes on the field until after a pitcher throws a pitch, according to ESPN's Jesse Rogers.\n\nMLB owners wanted to crack down on the tactic due to concern over first- and third-base coaches moving up and down the foul line to try to get a better view of the pitcher, per ESPN. If those coaches discovered what pitch was coming, they would reportedly relay that information directly to the batter or to a runner on second base, who could signal to the hitter what pitch was coming.\n\nThe league attempted to curb the tactic during the 2025 World Series, when it told both the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays to make sure their first- and third-base coaches stayed in their designated coaches' boxes on the field.\n\nWith the creation of PitchCom, the art of stealing catcher signs is essentially extinct around the league. Because MLB teams will try to exploit any advantage possible, teams and coaches have turned to extensive film study ahead of games, trying to find tells from the pitcher or catcher to determine what pitch is coming next. Unlike the pitch-stealing scandal the Houston Astros engaged in during the 2017 MLB season, this version of pitch-stealing is completely legal since it doesn't rely on the in-game use of technology.\n\nIn 2017, the Astros were accused of using cameras and video monitors to steal signs from their opponents. After MLB conducted an investigation into those claims, commissioner Rob Manfred announced one-year suspensions for then-Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and then-manager A.J. Hinch. Shortly after those suspensions were announced, the Astros fired both men.\n\nBoston Red Sox manager Alex Cora was later suspended for a year for his involvement in the scandal. Cora previously coached with the Astros before being hired by the Red Sox in 2018. The Red Sox fired Cora ahead of the 2020 season, but brought him back for the 2021 MLB season.\n\nPlayers and coaches are allowed to steal signs from pitchers or catchers during games without the use of technology, but MLB reportedly felt first- and third-base coaches were getting too brazen with their tactics, per ESPN.\n\nThe MLB rulebook states the first- and third-base coaches must remain in their coaches' box from the time the pitcher steps on the pitching rubber to the time the ball is caught by the catcher or put in play. Coaches, however, are allowed to leave the coaches' box for safety reasons.\n\nUnder the new rule, first- and third-base coaches will receive a warning for their first violation. After that, coaches could be ejected from games for leaving the coaches' box too early, per ESPN.",

    "fullText": "Former Blue Jays starter Chris Bassitt agreed to terms on a one year, $18.5 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles today. Bassitt, who turns 37 next Sunday, spent the last three seasons with the Blue Jays. He was originally drafted by the White Sox, but spent the bulk of his MLB career as an Oakland A, with a one year stint with the Mets before signing in Toronto.\n\nHe was effective last season, making 31 starts and posting a 3.96 ERA over 170.1 innings. He moved to the bullpen for the playoffs, logging a 1.04 ERA over seven appearances and 8.2 innings and was a solid contributor to the World Series run. Overall, he gave the Jays 541.1 innings with a 3.89 ERA. That innings total ranks ninth in the majors over the past three seasons, while the ERA was 5% better than league average. He was exactly the kind of workhorse #3 they’d hoped for when they signed him, and it was great to have him on the team.\n\nWith the additions of Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce early in free agency, it doesn’t seem like the team was serious about bringing him back, though. With Cease, plus Kevin Gausman signed for one more year, the emergence of Trey Yesavage, and (theoretically) Shane Bieber also taking a spot, he’d have had to battle with Jose Berrios for the #5 spot even before the Ponce signing. Given his track record, it makes sense that he’d pursue a more guaranteed starting job.\n\nIt’s unfortunate for us that that job comes in Baltimore. The Orioles project to have one of the best offenses in baseball, with homegrown starts Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, and Jackson Holliday paired with free agent slugger Pete Alonso, but their rotation is a weak spot that had looked like it might keep them out of the top tier of AL contenders. Bassitt gives them a steady hand to back up the mercurial Shane Baz and the talented but often injured Trevor Rogers at the top of the rotation. He doesn’t solve a lack of top end pitching talent, and they still project behind the Yankees, Jays and Red Sox, but the gap is closed a bit and the AL East becomes even more of a gauntlet.\n\nThat aside, I wish Bassitt well. He was a great addition to the team while he was here, and seemed pretty likeable. I hope he pitches well enough to be traded to a contender in the NL at the deadline.",

    "fullText": "A 2013 BBM Shohei Ohtani autograph card sold for $430,050 this weekend, setting a record for the most expensive card of the superstar before he came to MLB.\n\nThe card, which depicts Ohtani playing with NPB’s Nippon Ham Fighters, received a Gem Mint 10 grade from PSA — the highest grade possible. Ohtani has had plenty of other cards fetch an absurd amount on the open market this offseason, with a Topps 1-of-1 card selling for $3 million in Dec. 2025.\n\nHaving grown up in Japan, Ohtani played in NPB from 2013-17.\n\nHe took the league by storm as a unique, two-way player in his rookie season, though his numbers weren’t quite what fans would expect to see today.\n\nOhtani had a .643 OPs in 2013, and also struggled on the mound with a 4.02 ERA.\n\nHe continued to improve, though, and saw his numbers drastically increase the following year. In 2014, he had a .842 OPS and posted a 2.61 ERA through 155.1 innings pitched. Ohtani only got better from there, and had become an elite player by his final year in NPB.\n\nIn the 2017 season, the two-way star hit 22 home runs and tallied 67 RBIs, maintaining a 1.004 OPS throughout the season. On the mound, he had a 1.86 ERA through 140 innings and struck out 174 batters.\n\nThe star has blossomed into the best player in the world since joining MLB, so it’s no wonder his memorabilia is fetching such a high price. He’ll look to continue to grow in 2026, as the Dodgers chase the franchise’s first three-peat.\n\nThe post Japanese Shohei Ohtani Baseball Card Sells for Record Price appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

It’s a sensible contract for a pitcher who was the highest-paid player in the game as recently as 2023.\n\nVerlander has won three Cy Young Awards in a 20-year career that will one day land him in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nLast season, Verlander went 4-11 with a 3.85 ERA in 29 starts for the San Francisco Giants. Despite his poor record, Verlander made 29 starts and struck out 137 batters over 152 innings. His 3.85 FIP matched the one he posted in 2023 for the New York Mets and Houston Astros, when he pitched 162.1 innings with a 3.22 ERA.\n\nIn Detroit, Verlander will join a deep rotation that helped the Tigers win the American League Central division in 2025.

    "description": "Speaking with MLB Network, UCLA shortstop Roch Cholowsky reflects on his breakout Bruins season, his path away from football, and how a lifetime around professional scouting has shaped him into a potential No. 1 overall pick.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES -- Roch Cholowsky has never lacked perspective on where he is — or where he’s headed.\n\n“It's a special award, the best of the best win it.” 😤@UCLABaseball standout Roch Cholowsky joined #MLBNHotStove to discuss the upcoming season and the @USAGoldenSpikes Award.\n\nFind out the full #GoldenSpikes Preseason Watch List today at 3pm ET! pic.twitter.com/R1HUpVhy85\n\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) February 6, 2026\n\nThe UCLA shortstop, widely viewed as a potential No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming MLB Draft, recently reflected on a Bruins program that rebounded sharply after a difficult stretch, setting the stage for what could be a defining year in his baseball journey. After going 19–33 during his freshman season, Cholowsky said the team made a conscious decision to stay unified, recommit in the offseason, and reset expectations.\n\nThat approach paid off. UCLA surged to a fifth-place finish last season and returns much of its core, giving Cholowsky confidence that the Bruins can build on that momentum. While outside recognition has followed, including early Golden Spikes Award buzz, Cholowsky emphasized that team success remains the priority. Individual honors, he noted, would be meaningful, but a national championship is the ultimate goal.\n\nBeing mentioned alongside past Golden Spikes winners is not something Cholowsky takes lightly. He described the award as baseball’s equivalent of the Heisman, reserved for the game’s elite, and acknowledged that hearing his name in that conversation is both humbling and motivating. Still, he views it as a byproduct of doing the right things on the field rather than a singular pursuit.\n\nCholowsky’s long-term vision was already clear coming out of high school, when he went undrafted despite interest from several clubs. He said most teams understood he was committed to UCLA, a decision he felt was the right one after experiencing college baseball firsthand. The limited draft dialogue only reinforced his belief that development and patience would pay off.\n\nThat clarity extended to his choice to step away from football. A standout high school quarterback, Cholowsky admitted it was difficult to leave the sport behind, but focusing exclusively on baseball allowed him to fully invest in his growth. Once acclimated, he said, his progress accelerated.\n\nFew players arrive at that crossroads with Cholowsky’s background. His father, Dan, spent years in professional baseball as both a player and a scout, giving Roch a rare window into the evaluation process from a young age. From sitting in on in-home scouting meetings to hearing firsthand stories about elite prospects, those experiences shaped how he understands the game.\n\nFor Cholowsky, that foundation — combined with performance — has positioned him for an extraordinary few months ahead, even as he remains grounded in the work still to be done.",

    "description": "One recent DFA reportedly cleared waivers on Wednesday while another was claimed by the organization where he made his MLB debut",
    "fullText": "The waiver wire was a frequent stop for the Washington Nationals through January after the front office navigated through January with seven official claims, though a pair were designated for assignment just days after joining the organization. It marked a sneaky way for president of baseball operations Paul Toboni to restock his Triple-A roster while tweaking the minor league roster, but the pair of designations marked a risky move in the process with a chance for other teams to swoop in.\n\nThat came to reality for a pair of former waiver claims on Wednesday with a mix of good and bad news on a pair of players.\n\nThe good news is that left handed pitcher Konnor Pilkington reportedly cleared waivers on Wednesday, setting the stage for the Nationals to designate him for assignment in Triple-A. Pilkington was designated for assignment last week to make room for shortstop Tsung-Che Chung, who spent the bulk of last season with Pittsburgh’s Triple-A affiliate.\n\nKonnor Pilkington cleared waivers. Waiting on an official announcement if he accepted his outright to Triple-A.\n\n— Talk Nats (@TalkNats) February 5, 2026\n\nAfter making his debut with the Nationals in July of 2025, Pilkington posted a 4.45 ERA last season with the Nationals over 28.1 innings pitched after he was initially drafted in the third round of the 2018 MLB draft by the Chicago White Sox. The pitcher has also spent time within the Cleveland Guardians and Arizona Diamondbacks organizations. Despite an average ERA during his major league tenure, command appeared to be a challenge for the southpaw. Pilkington allowed 17 walks during his 28.1 innings pitched, compared to 34 strikeouts.\n\nPilkington began his career with the Cleveland Guardians in 2022 where he started in 11 games and appeared in 15, finishing the season with a 3.88 ERA and 50 strikeouts to 32 walks. He then made one appearance in 2023 where he tossed a pair of strikeouts in a pair of scoreless inning, though struggled in his limited time in Triple-A. He was traded to Arizona for cash considerations in May of 2023 where he would spend the rest of the season and 2024 with Triple-A Reno.\n\nThe bad news on Wednesday was that Mickey Gasper, who was designed for assignment last week after the team claimed left hander Richard Lovelady, was claimed by the Boston Red Sox. Washington claimed Gasper from the Minnesota Twins in a flurry of moves through January, but now eliminating one potential option in the Nationals' farm system.\n\nThe Red Sox have claimed Mickey Gasper off waivers. HES BACK!!! pic.twitter.com/HKibdDzfJf\n\n— SleeperRedSox (@SleeperRedSox) February 4, 2026\n\nGasper now returns to the organization to gave him his MLB debut after Boston selected Gasper in the minor league phase of the Rule 5 Draft in 2023, making his debut as a pinch hitter in 2024 where he drew four walks and was hit by a pitch despite finishing 0-for-18 in his at-bats with the Red Sox. Gasper spent the 2025 season with the Minnesota Twins where he batted .158/.257/.232 with a pair of home runs, 11 RBIs and two stolen bases in 45 appearances. The Twins then designated him for assignment in mid-January, the first of what has proven to be a flurry of moves for the utility infielder.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — In just nine days, teams across MLB will begin to have their pitchers and catchers report to Spring Training, and one familiar superstar has already begun his preparation ahead of the chaos.\n\nComing off back-to-back World Series titles with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Shohei Ohtani begins year three in Dodger blue with a head start, as he was seen Wednesday morning working on his pitching mechanics at the Dodgers Spring Training Facility in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nIt’s widely known that, when it comes to perfecting the little details in terms of a routine, Ohtani is the most precise in the league, and he displayed it once more, going through every second of his pitching motion.\n\nEven down to his foot pushing off the rubber, every movement has to flow to perfection.\n\n#ドジャース #大谷翔平 選手⚾️\n\nアリゾナ州グレンデールで自主トレ💨\n\nキャッチボール🔥#LetsGoDodgers #ShoheiOhtani #侍ジャパン #WBC pic.twitter.com/VRhXLiYLQM\n\n— Masaya Kotani (@MasayaKotani) February 4, 2026\n\nThe world saw the likes of Ohtani pitching for the Dodgers for the first time last year as the season began to wind down, and it was also the first time we got to see the two-way unicorn step on the mound in the postseason en route to the Dodgers' third World Series title in the last five years.\n\nOhtani went through a tedious, yet instrumental, comeback in terms of rehab when it came to his pitching.\n\nWhether it was through a precarious number of live bullpen sessions sprinkled in throughout the majority of the 2025 season, or frequent throwing assignments hours before games, every pitch was a telltale sign of Ohtani’s pitching dominance beginning to shine through.\n\n#大谷翔平 投手は左足スパイク、右足ソックスで壁当てを実施。軸足で地面を蹴る感覚をつかむためでしょうか。珍しい光景でした。@Dodgers #Dodgers pic.twitter.com/XiTKeh0dbw\n\n— 横山尚杜(Naoto Yokoyama) サンスポMLB担当 (@Naoto_SANSPO) February 4, 2026\n\nNow, after scratching off pitching in the postseason for the first time and essentially full steam ahead to pitch with no restrictions in 2026, Ohtani will look forward to next season as the year he contributes on the pitching side for Los Angeles.\n\nOhtani was thought to be working even earlier on his pitching, as he said at DodgersFest last Saturday that there was a possibility that he would pitch for Team Japan in the WBC.\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts quickly shot down the idea of Ohtani stepping on the mound for Team Japan a little over an hour after Ohtani spoke to the media, and it was revealed on Tuesday that insurance would not be written off on Ohtani as a pitcher anyway.\n\nWith the WBC out of mind, Ohtani’s early ramp up to Spring Training rewrites the narrative once more that, not only does he want to be a factor to the Dodgers starting rotation in 2026, which is headlined by the likes of fellow countrymen Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki, along with Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell, but add another piece of hardware to an undeniable resume.\n\nThe 31-year-old Japanese superstar is a four-time unanimous MVP winner, five-time All-Star, four-time Silver Slugger, three-time Hank Aaron Award winner, and American League Rookie of the Year winner in 2018, but the coveted Cy Young Award is the only piece missing from his trophy cabinet.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan and Ohtani can stray away from injury to his throwing arm, 2026 will be the first season Ohtani pitches for Los Angeles from the jump and could notch 20-plus starts like years past.",

    "title": "ESPN insider: Kevin McGonigle will make 'immediate impact' for Tigers",
    "description": "ESPN MLB reporter Buster Olney predicts that Detroit Tigers top prospect Kevin McGonigle will make an \"immediate impact\" in 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers have a couple top prospects who could see big league action very soon, with one in particular getting MLB experts excited.\n\nESPN's MLB analysts provided predictions for various top prospects in an article published on Tuesday, Feb. 3, and Buster Olney kicked it off with Tigers infielder Kevin McGonigle, currently ranked as the No. 2 prospect in baseball by ESPN.\n\n\"No matter where he plays, McGonigle will be a fixture in the Tigers' every-day lineup by midseason and make an immediate impact,\" he wrote.\n\nThe \"immediate impact\" part of his analysis may not surprise Tigers fans, or at least those who read prospect lists. McGonigle is the top prospect in the Tigers' system and a near-consensus top-2 prospect in baseball, with MLB Pipeline and Baseball America (like ESPN) ranking him No. 2 overall below Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Konnor Griffin.\n\nMcGonigle also slashed .254/.369/.550 in 206 plate appearances across 46 games at Double-A Erie in 2025, showing off professional-level hitting skills that could fit in immediately with the Tigers lineup. And with some exposure at third base in the 2025 Arizona Fall League season (where he continued to hit exceptionally well), he could also bring some defensive versatility to the Tigers.\n\nHOW TO WATCH: Detroit Tigers leaving FanDuel Sports Network for MLB Media: Report\n\nWhat Tigers fans might be more interested in, however, is Olney predicting McGonigle will be in the Tigers lineup by midseason.\n\nIf the Tigers were to wait until around mid-May to call up McGonigle, they would retain an extra year of service time for their top prospect, meaning McGonigle would be in line to become a free agent in 2032 instead of 2031. That extra year for a prospect as highly praised as McGonigle could be incredibly valuable for the Tigers, meaning he might start the season in the minors instead of in Detroit.\n\nHowever, there are also strong arguments for calling up McGonigle to start the season. The Tigers have not signed a dedicated third baseman to their roster for 2026, right now projecting to use Colt Keith and Zach McKinstry at the position. McGonigle could potentially fill that role (while also able to play second base and shortstop) and bring a spark to the lineup.\n\nThe Tigers could also benefit from MLB's Prospect Promotion Incentive if they call up McGonigle within the first two weeks of the season, potentially earning an extra draft pick should McGonigle finish in the top-3 in the American League Rookie of the Year vote in 2026.\n\nTigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris addressed the team's plans for McGonigle at his end-of-season press conference in October (without naming McGonigle specifically), saying: \"I expect the players that posted dominant years in Double-A to factor into our big-league team next year ... I expect them to be in Detroit at some point next year.\"\n\nThe move that might make the most sense for the Tigers is to call up McGonigle in the middle of the season to take advantage of his production while retaining an extra year of his eligibility. If the Tigers were to call up McGonigle in late May or early June, for example, they could get McGonigle in the lineup for a huge chunk of their season without starting his service clock –⁠ though they wouldn't be eligible for a PPI pick.\n\nBut either way, it shouldn't surprise Tigers fans if McGonigle is up at some point in the 2026 season.\n\nNeed to catch up on the news during your lunch break? \n\nYou can reach Christian at cromo@freepress.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Kevin McGonigle to make 'immediate impact' for Tigers per Buster Olney",

    "fullText": "Yankees get lackluster offseason grade amid shaky reliance on five players originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees didn't have the most prolific offseason. They didn't land multiple All-Stars like the New York Mets or the Los Angeles Dodgers, and didn't swing big deals and trades like the Toronto Blue Jays, Baltimore Orioles, or Boston Red Sox.\n\nBut the Yankees did bring back Trent Grisham and Cody Bellinger, along with trading for Ryan Weathers to go with the plethora of depth additions Brian Cashman made.\n\nWhile the 94-68 Yankees are running it back, Jim Bowden of The Athletic gave the Yankees a \"C\" grade for their offseason. He highlighted five players the Yankees are relying on, and expressed concern about whether they should rely on those players or not.\n\n\"The Yankees will be counting on Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodon, and Anthony Volpe to successfully return from their injuries after starting the season on the IL,\" Bowden writes. \"They are hopeful Volpe, Austin Wells, and Ben Rice will have breakout seasons.\"\n\nThanks to very few changes being made to the roster for the 2026 season, the Yankees will need to get a lot of development and progress from these five players.\n\nBowden singled out Cole and Rodon as two of the Yankees' biggest question marks for the 2026 season: \"Can Cole and Rodon bounce back from their injuries to give the Yankees one of the best starting rotations in baseball?\"\n\nWhile seeing Cole and Rodon bounce back in a major way is within the realm of possibility, there's no guarantee when they'll be back, and even when they do return, they might not be nearly as good as they once were.\n\nMore: Yankees reveal plans for power prospect Spencer Jones\n\nRelying on Rodon and Cole for a positive outlook in 2026 is risky for the Yankees, and that's not the only risk at play.\n\nWhen Volpe returns from injury is also uncertain, and as Bowden notes, the Yankees will not just need him back; they will be hoping for a breakout year from the young shortstop.\n\nRelying on Volpe to such a degree is a lot on his plate, and even though Aaron Judge, Bellinger, and others will help alleviate the need for Volpe to breakout to win, to get over the hump and back into the World Series, he likely does need to breakout.\n\nAdd on that the Yankees are relying on Wells and Rice to both break out, and this upcoming season is a very risky one for the Yankees.\n\nRelying on multiple, if not all of these players, to breakout in 2026 is a very shaky path for the Yankees. It's possible, but not the most likely outcome. If it doesn't happen, 2026 could be a disappointing season.\n\nPirates' stance on trading Paul Skenes called into question by The Athletic\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nRed Sox busy offseason now includes a whopping 9 trades\n\nMets face 2 key questions after offseason of change\n\nReds reunite with 49-homer slugger at major discount with $15 million free agent news\n\nRed Sox make big $15 million mistake with Eugenio Suarez Reds news\n\nOrioles trade for 23-year old third baseman from AL foe",

    "fullText": "At -125, Shohei Ohtani is breathing rarefied air at his current price.\n\nConsider last year, when he was the overwhelming preseason favorite to win NL MVP, and he was still only +150 by the end of March, per Sports Odds History. That was already crazy, because the shortest number we've generally seen in recent years is +200 or +300.\n\nBelow, we'll look at the early MLB odds for the 2026 season, and AL & NL MVP, as the likes of Alex Bregman (Chicago Cubs) and Kyle Tucker (Los Angeles Dodgers) have found new homes since our previous look.\n\nHere are the last 10 winners of the AL and NL MVP Award, with Shohei Ohtani leading the way as a four-time winner, with two in the AL and two in the NL. Only Frank Robinson has also won MVP awards in both leagues.\n\nBarry Bonds holds the record for most MVP awards (seven)\n\nThe New York Yankees have won the most MVPs in MLB history with 25, while the St. Louis Cardinals are second, leading all NL teams, with 21. No player for the Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Mets, or Tampa Bay Rays has ever won MVP.\n\nMost sportsbooks will display odds in the American format as listed above. When Goldschmidt ran away with the MVP award in 2022 his odds had a minus (-) sign ahead of the number for a large part of the season.\n\nThat means that a bettor in August had to wager $6,000 to win $100 by betting on Goldy to win MVP. Before the season starts, almost every player will have a plus (+) sign ahead of their odds.\n\nThat means a bettor would have profited $200 for a $100 wager on Ohtani before the season started.\n\nIf American odds aren't your thing, simply use a tool like our odds converter to switch the odds to decimal or fractional format.

    "description": "Amid the talk about the Dodgers' spending, a special agreement between MLB and the Dodgers over L.A.'s TV money share has come up.",
    "fullText": "Amid the conversation about the team’s spending, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ TV deal with Spectrum has come up, namely, a special clause that allows the Dodgers to retain an additional portion of their TV revenue.\n\nThe signing of outfielder Kyle Tucker has sparked a total meltdown on social media, with fanbases from all over the MLB spectrum coming out of the woodwork and calling out the Dodgers for “ruining baseball.”\n\nTucker is set to earn $60 million per season, an incredibly high average annual value, which will have him among the highest-paid athletes in the sport. He is joining a team already full of stars in Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Freddie Freeman — the reigning World Series champions.\n\nAs a result, an agreement between the Dodgers’ owners, the Guggenheim Group, and MLB has begun to circulate.\n\nThe LA Times’ Bill Shaikin outlined the terms of the deal between MLB and the Dodgers that have indeed led to the team keeping a larger share of its revenue.\n\nWhile trying to oust Frank McCourt as an owner in MLB, the league blocked a $3 billion deal between the Dodgers and Fox Sports, prompting McCourt to file a suit in bankruptcy court.\n\nMcCourt was trying to sell the team for all its worth, and he needed to make sure bidders knew what to expect from a TV deal.\n\nIn bankruptcy court, MLB agreed that the fair-market value for the Dodgers’ TV deal was the Fox offer, meaning the league would take its 34 percent cut based on those terms.\n\nHowever, the Dodgers ended up striking a deal worth more than $8 billion, though MLB could not take more from the new deal.\n\nDuring an appearance on Dodgers Dougout with Doug McKain, Shakin explained how the deal materialized.\n\n“In a nutshell, in order to get Frank McCourt out, which was the objective from MLB, they had to make a deal with him in bankruptcy court,” Shakin said on the show.\n\n“And part of that deal was how are you going to value the television contract? And since a television contract did not exist at that time, because a new owner had not even been selected, they did the best they could.\n\n“And Guggenheim came out with a really great offer that I think blew even MLB’s wildest expectations away. MLB wasn’t thrilled, but they’re living by the terms of the deal, and that’s where we are.”\n\nA lot of people have been on the timeline complaining about the Dodgers “unfair TV deal”\n\nThe truth is even if the Dodgers gave up more of that money to other teams, opposing owners still wouldn’t spend ????\n\n(W/ @dmac_la) pic.twitter.com/f4wkjmBU4D\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) January 28, 2026\n\nMLB did try to push for new terms that hold the Dodgers to the same standard as other teams, but the settlement in bankruptcy court was too much of a blocker.\n\nHowever, as Shakin outlines, the Dodgers’ new owners, Guggenheim, did work with MLB to find a middle ground.\n\n“So in a normal situation, Major League Baseball would have said, this is a crazy high deal and good for you, and we’re happy, but we gotta share this money just like we share any other money.\n\n“And in this case, MLB could only push so far because Guggenheim was willing to work with MLB to a point. And then Guggenheim could have gone back to the court and said, ‘we got a deal, please, Mr. Judge, enforce the deal. That’s what you’re here for.’\n\n“And the court, as they say in legal circles, has jurisdiction over the deal, which means they run everything.\n\n“So, MLB could have been stuck with the original settlement, which was not as favorable as what they got in the negotiations with Guggenheim.\n\n“Is it equal for all other teams? Absolutely not. Is it a competitive advantage for the Dodgers? Sure. Now, is it as big a competitive advantage as some people are making it? I don’t think so ’cause the contract itself is way more than the individual amount the Dodgers are saving every year.”",

    "fullText": "Detroit Tigers starting pitcher Tarik Skubal is the best pitcher in baseball and is currently pushing for one of the largest arbitration salaries in MLB history. He has also been the subject of MLB trade rumors, but Detroit’s demands could prevent a deal from happening.\n\nAppearing in a Bleacher Report live stream, MLB insider Jon Heyman of the New York Post said that while the Tigers haven’t exactly named a clear price for Skubal that they’ve set their demands high enough that it pushed two teams out of the hunt.\n\n“It is high…My impression from the Yankees and the Mets is that it was too high for them…Detroit isn’t exactly naming the exact prices, so it’s not really a two-way discussion at this points. Teams are making offers and I don’t think they are coming close at this point.”\n\nJon Heyman on the Detroit Tigers asking price for a Tarik Skubal trade\n\nHeyman noted that while the Yankees are interested in adding another starting pitcher, there is zero interest in meeting the demands set by Detroit. New York is adamant about not including starting pitcher Cam Schlittler, top prospect George Lombard Jr., and potentially even more for the two-time AL Cy Young Award winner.\n\nAs for the Mets, they already made their aggressive move to fortify the starting rotation with the trade for All-Star pitcher Freddy Peralta. New York also acquired Tobias Myers in the deal, and after dealing several of its top prospects, the club does not want to give up even more for a one-season rental of Skubal.\n\nThe Tigers’ extremely high asking price for Skubal certainly isn’t surprising. He has recorded the lowest ERA in the American League in each of the past two seasons and sports a 2.39 ERA with a 0.90 WHIP and a 38–13 record across 467.2 innings over the last three seasons. He is without question the best starter in baseball.\n\nEntering a contract year, however, teams simply are not willing to gut their farm systems and move several of their top prospects for an ace who will test the open market next winter. Realistically, Skubal will be Detroit’s Opening Day starter, and a trade is likelier to happen before the MLB trade deadline on August 3.\n\nReport: BOS Red Sox Already Want to Move on From Key Player in Rafael Devers Trade\n\nMLB Rumors: NY Yankees Interested in Adding NL MVP Before Opening Day\n\nMLB News: Los Angeles Dodgers’ All-Star Could Miss Start of 2026 Season",

    "fullText": "It’s that magical time of the year for MLB fans. Pitchers and catchers report in just over two weeks, and this is the final month of the year without baseball until possibly November. MLB Network has an annual tradition where their analysts rank the top 10 players at every position, and former big league pitcher Ron Darling dropped his rankings on Wednesday. Let’s take a look and see who he has in his top 10.\n\nJacob deGrom cracks Ron Darling’s Top 10 Starting Pitchers\n\n— MLB Now (@MLBNow) January 29, 2026\n\nMORE: Team USA’s 2026 WBC roster could be the best baseball team ever\n\nFried had a great first season in the Bronx last year and will anchor the Yankees rotation once again.\n\nWith Framber Valdez gone, Brown has even more pressure on him to repeat his breakout season from a year ago.\n\ndeGrom was one of the best pitchers in the American League last season and is proving that age is just a number.\n\nHe had a breakout season for the Mariners and will look to take another step forward in his development.\n\nHis heroic postseason performance has him looking like one of the best big-game pitchers in the league today.\n\nSanchez had a tremendous 2025 season for the Phillies, and will begin the season as the team’s ace.\n\nHe was the best pitcher in the American League last season, not named Skubal. He anchors a very talented Red Sox rotation.\n\nIt was a little surprising to see Webb on this list, let alone this high. He is a good pitcher who is durable and has good stuff, and if this were an NL-only top 10 list, he should be on it.\n\nThe best young pitcher in baseball, reigning NL Cy Young award winner, and the Pirates only hope to get back to the postseason this decade.\n\nThe two-time reigning AL Cy Young award winner will look to make it three straight in 2026, which also could be his last season with the Tigers.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings, 30 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nNHL: NHL Power Rankings, 32 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl 60 graphic resurfaces\n\nWWE: WWE Power Rankings ahead of Royal Rumble\n\nVIRAL: Shaun White pulls off epic Central Park snowboarding stunt over Shane Gillis\n\nThe post MLB Network analyst Ron Darling ranks his top 10 Starting Pitchers in 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Ranking shortstops is never just about comparing stat lines. It is about identifying who provides the most value in baseball’s most demanding position. MLB Network’s “The Shredder” combines recent performance with a deep dive into offensive and defensive metrics to sort the elite from the very good. Here are the 10 players it rates highest as we approach the 2026 campaign.\n\nStats to know: 26 HR, 26 SB (2025).\n\nNeto lands at number 10 on both The Shredder’s list and Brian Kenny’s personal rankings, which speaks volumes about his rapid ascent. The logic for his inclusion is simple enough. He is already producing power and speed from a premium spot on the diamond very early in his career. For the Angels, that dual-threat ability is the cornerstone of a lineup that desperately needs reliable production up the middle.​\n\nDe La Cruz checks in at number nine on The Shredder’s 2026 list, a clear nod to a toolkit that can alter the course of a game even when he isn’t fully dialed in. He holds the same spot on MLB.com’s recap, keeping him firmly within the position’s top tier. His appeal is easy to see. He pressures defenses in ways that almost no other shortstop can, forcing the league to account for him on every single pitch.​\n\nStats to know: .840 OPS (2025).\n\nPeña arrives at number eight for 2026, marking his first appearance in the Top 10 at shortstop according to MLB.com. This detail is significant because these lists typically favor sustained value over isolated hot streaks. Houston has always asked its shortstops to be steady with the glove and productive at the plate, and Peña’s recent performance confirms he is meeting that high standard.\n\nTurner sits at number seven on the SI-reported Shredder list, occupying the territory where consistency and track record start to weigh as heavily as peak potential. His ranking reflects an established history of production that keeps him relevant even as the position gets younger and deeper. When a player remains in this tier year after year, it signals that analysts still trust his baseline contributions despite a crowded field at the top.​\n\nStats to know: 20 HR, 7.1 FanGraphs WAR (2025).\n\nPerdomo lands in sixth place, a jump framed by MLB.com as the result of a breakout season that redefined his profile. While the power surge grabbed headlines, the real differentiator at shortstop is when that offense comes without sacrificing defense. For Arizona, this ranking serves as validation that his strong season wasn’t a fluke. It has moved him onto the short list of the game’s best at his position.\n\nStats to know: 21 Outs Above Average (led NL SS), 17 Defensive Runs Saved (most among SS).​\n\nBetts holds the fifth spot for a second consecutive year, which is impressive considering he is still relatively new to playing shortstop full-time. The defensive metrics highlighted in the SI report explain why he remains here. The model is rewarding legitimate shortstop value rather than just a superstar playing out of position. With the Dodgers committing to him as their starter for 2026, this isn’t a temporary experiment. It is simply their plan.​\n\nHenderson ranks fourth on the 2026 list after entering last season at number one. This placement matters because it suggests his overall package remains elite even if the top spot has shifted. In a ranking system that weighs both offense and defense, staying in the top four means you are impacting the game on both sides of the ball rather than just compiling counting stats.​\n\nLindor slots in at number three, a ranking reserved for players who deliver reliable output year after year at a position that exposes every flaw. He also takes third on MLB.com’s recap, reinforcing that his standing is one of the least debated in the top 10. When a position is this deep, being a consensus top-three choice is an accomplishment in itself. It means your floor is respected just as much as your ceiling.​\n\nSeager enters 2026 at number two on The Shredder’s list, keeping him squarely in the conversation for the game’s best shortstop. He also holds the second spot on MLB.com’s published rankings, aligning the broader view with the model’s data. The main takeaway here is stability. Even with constant turnover around the league, the rankings continue to treat him as a pillar near the very top of the position.​\n\nStats to know: Led MLB in hits for the second straight season.\n\nWitt claims the number one spot for 2026, becoming the sixth different shortstop to lead the list in the last six years. MLB.com links his rise directly to his production, specifically highlighting his back-to-back seasons leading the majors in hits. In a model built to blend offense, defense, and overall impact, that combination of volume and value is exactly what pushes a player to the top of the list.​\n\nRankings don’t win games, but they do show where the league’s most dependable two-way value can be found. This top 10 reminds us that playing shortstop in 2026 requires a wide range of skills that all lead to the same result: winning impact. The only real verdict will come in April when these names have to turn their list positions into victories on the field.\n\nThe post MLB: Top 10 Shortstops heading into the 2026 season appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The hot stove is officially burning. While pitchers and catchers don’t report until mid-February, the 2026 offseason has already delivered a flurry of massive contracts, trades, and extensions. From record-breaking re-signings to blockbuster moves for new faces, teams are opening their checkbooks to secure the talent needed for a World Series run. Here are the top 10 richest deals signed so far this winter, ranked by total contract value.\n\nDeal: 2 years, $40 million\nThe Mets continue to spend aggressively, bolstering their infield with Polanco. At $20 million per year, it’s a significant commitment for a veteran bat who brings switch-hitting power and versatility. This move signals New York’s intent to add reliable offensive depth to its star-studded lineup.\n\nDeal: 3 years, $45 million\nPhiladelphia locks up its field general, ensuring continuity behind the plate. While the annual value is lower than his previous market-setting deal, this contract keeps one of the game’s best all-around catchers in red pinstripes. It’s a move about stability and leadership for a team with championship aspirations.\n\nDeal: 3 years, $45 million\nThe Braves invest heavily in their bullpen, signing Suarez to lock down the late innings. After saving 40 games with a sub-3.00 ERA, he commands a premium price for a reliever. This deal reflects the modern emphasis on elite bullpen arms as essential postseason weapons.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $57.5 million (Extension)\nKansas City bets on its young core, extending its third baseman through his prime years. Garcia’s breakout 2025 season, featuring 16 homers and 23 steals, secured his financial future and solidified his status as a cornerstone player. It’s a classic small-market move to buy out arbitration years and secure cost certainty.\n\nDeal: 4 years, $60 million\nThe Blue Jays tap into the international market, bringing Japanese slugger Okamoto to North America. With a track record of elite power in the NPB, including a record-breaking 56-homer season, he offers high-upside offensive potential. This signing is a calculated risk to inject power into the middle of Toronto’s order.\n\nDeal: 3 years, $126 million\nIn a stunning splash, the Mets land the All-Star shortstop on a massive short-term deal. The high AAV ($42 million) allows Bichette to re-enter the market while giving New York an elite bat in his prime. It’s a “win-now” move that reshapes their infield and adds another premium playmaker to the mix.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $130 million\nBoston addresses its most significant need, starting pitching, by poaching a reliable arm from a rival. Suarez brings playoff experience and a lefty profile that should play well at Fenway Park. This contract signifies that the Red Sox are done sitting on the sidelines and are ready to spend for rotation stability.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $150 million (Extension)\nThe Phillies ensure their designated slugger isn’t going anywhere. Schwarber’s ability to hit homers in bunches and work walks makes him a unique offensive force. This deal keeps the heart of Philadelphia’s order intact, prioritizing power and clubhouse leadership for the foreseeable future.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $155 million\nIn perhaps the offseason’s biggest shocker, the Orioles swipe the “Polar Bear” from their division rivals. Alonso’s prodigious power (38 homers, 126 RBIs) immediately transforms Baltimore’s lineup into a juggernaut. It’s a statement signing that declares the Orioles are ready to dominate the AL East for years to come.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $162.5 million (Extension)\nThe Yankees retain their star outfielder with the richest deal of the winter so far. Bellinger’s bounce-back performance proved he’s still an elite contributor, and New York paid a premium to keep his left-handed bat in the Bronx. This contract solidifies the Yankees’ outfield and keeps a key piece of their championship puzzle in place.\n\nWith Jose Ramirez’s reworked $175 million deal also making headlines, the market is clearly robust for elite talent. As spring training approaches, expect a few more dominoes to fall, but for now, these 10 deals define the financial landscape of the 2026 season.\n\nThe post MLB: Ranking the top 10 richest free agent signings of 2026 offseason appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow the various narrative paths.\n\n“Maybe I called it wrong, but it’s official.” — Tom Connolly, HoF Umpire.\n\nSteve Trout* and others are traded for, plus the expanded strike zone and more! Where were you when it really snowed in Chicago?\n\n1931 – The International League accepts the open draft imposed by the major leagues. Until this time, the top minor leagues could control their players and refuse to sell them. (2)\n\n1932 – Chicago Cubs owner William Wrigley dies at the age of 70 in Phoenix, Arizona. Wrigley had owned the team since 1919. Wrigley’s son Philip inherits controlling interest in both the Cubs and the minor league Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, but will leave most of the daily operations to Cubs president William Veeck. (1,2)\n\n1963 – Major League Baseball’s Rules Committee increases the size of the strike zone. The zone will stretch from the top of the batter’s shoulders to the bottom of the knees. The committee hopes the return to the 1950s strike zone will result in a decrease in runs scored. The results will exceed the committee’s expectations, and after the “Year of the Pitcher” in 1968, the strike zone will be tweaked again to give the hitters a break. (2)\n\n1983 – The Chicago White Sox trade pitchers Steve Trout* and Warren Brusstar to their cross-town rivals Cubs for pitchers Dick Tidrow and Randy Martz, and infielders Pat Tabler and Scott Fletcher.

    "description": "ESPN’s Jeff Passan explains why Tarik Skubal could win a record $32 million in arbitration over the Tigers’ $19M offer, citing Cy Young history and elite performance.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers and Tarik Skubal are staring at a number that has never existed in an arbitration hearing before.\n\nSkubal’s side filed at $32 million for the 2026 season. The Tigers countered at $19 million. That $13 million spread is not just large, it’s unprecedented. No arbitration case in MLB history has featured anything close to that kind of gap, and no player has ever been awarded a salary anywhere near $32 million through the process.\n\nYet, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan, history may be about to bend.\n\nPassan’s argument centers on one simple truth: Skubal isn’t just elite, he’s in rare, historic territory.\n\n“Even if the comparables are in Detroit’s favor, even if a $32 million award would smash the previous high awarded in a room by more than $12 million, Skubal is the first American Leaguer to win consecutive Cy Young Awards since Pedro Martinez in 1999-2000.”\n\nThat kind of resume changes how cases are viewed. Passan continued:\n\n“And in a world where lesser pitchers get $30 million-plus a season and Skubal can compare his salary to any in MLB, his performance, the best pitcher in baseball — will be enough to carry the day.”\n\nIn other words, precedent matters, but dominance matters more. Skubal’s back-to-back Cy Youngs place him in a category that very few pitchers in modern history have ever occupied.\n\nEven with logic, numbers, and awards on his side, Passan made it clear that nothing is guaranteed in the arbitration room.\n\n“Arbitration hearing rooms are notorious for their unpredictability,” Passan wrote. “Lawyers who have argued cases have left the room convinced they’d made airtight arguments — and lost. Others were despondent in the aftermath, certain of defeat, and emerged victorious.”\n\n“Which is to say that whatever approach Tarik Skubal’s team takes in trying to convince a three-person panel that he’s worthy of the $32 million he’s seeking instead of the $19 million the Detroit Tigers are offering, the ultimate result is a crapshoot.”\n\nThat uncertainty is what makes this case so fascinating — and potentially historic.\n\nBeyond the legal drama, this standoff sends a message. Skubal is the face of the franchise, the best pitcher in baseball, and the foundation of Detroit’s contention window. Filing at $19 million while he seeks $32 million creates a tension that goes far beyond one season’s paycheck.\n\nWhether the panel sides with Skubal or the Tigers, the outcome will ripple into future extension talks, trade rumors, and how the organization is viewed by its own superstar.\n\nOne way or another, Skubal will take the mound in 2026 as a Cy Young winner. The only question is whether he’ll do it as the most highly paid arbitration player in MLB history.\n\nThe post MLB Insider Predicts Outcome for Tarik Skubal Arbitration Case With Detroit Tigers appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPaul Skenes is one of the best pitchers on the planet, and that really hasn't been questioned at any point during his first two MLB seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nIf he keeps this up, he'll have a chance to make all kinds of history and set all sorts of records.\n\nIn 2026, Skenes could set two records if he keeps up his current pace.\n\nMLB.com's Sarah Langs wrote a new article this weekend breaking down the different all-time marks that could fall in the 2026 MLB season.

It'd be the second consecutive year that he led in ERA.\n\nSkenes would be the youngest to lead his league in ERA in back-to-back seasons since it was an official stat in 1913, according to Langs.\n\nThat previous record is currently held by Clayton Kershaw.\n\nSkenes also could set a strikeout record.\n\n\"Skenes is also projected to lead the NL in strikeouts, with 237,\" Langs writes. \"He would be the fifth youngest to lead his league in both ERA and strikeouts by age at the end of the season, older than only 1985 Gooden (20 years, 324 days), 1940 Bob Feller (21 years, 331 days), 1965 Sam McDowell (23 years, 12 days) and 2011 Kershaw (23 years, 193 days).\"\n\nMORE: The Reds aren't signing any free agents because of TV\n\nThe key to the Pirates' season ahead really isn't Skenes, though. They're expecting him to be a superstar, as usual.\n\nPittsburgh needs the rest of its roster to live up to Skenes.

    "fullText": "On Friday morning Dan Szymborski released the long-awaited Cardinals 2026 ZiPS projections and gave us all a short break from refreshing MLB Trade Rumors to see the latest on Brendan Donovan. ZiPS is the gold standard for publicly available projection systems and has been continuously refined to improve accuracy since Szymborski originally developed it in the early 2000s. If you haven’t yet, make sure to check out the full set of projections.\n\nThe first sneak peek was originally tweeted out on Thursday.\n\nA sneak peek at the ZiPS x @FanGraphs Depth Chart for the final ZiPS team, the St. Louis #Cardinals.#ZiPS26 pic.twitter.com/OsjW46VJPr\n\n— Dan Szymborski (@DSzymborski) January 22, 2026\n\nAt first glance this looks better than expected! It is important to note that the graphic above is based on the ZiPS projected rate stats, but the playing time allocation is based on the FanGraphs Depth Chart page, so the WAR totals in the graphic are not meant to line up with the ZiPS projection tables in the article. This also means that we cannot just add up the WAR totals to get a projected win total. The team projections will come out closer to the start of the season and are based on millions of simulations that account for much more variability and nuance than midpoint projections. With that lengthy caveat out of the way, I do think it is still worthwhile to see how the team’s projections stack up with the projections going into last year as well as the actual results in 2025.\n\nThe Cardinals rotation was sneakily horrible last year thanks to the 250 innings given to Miles Mikolas and Erick Fedde, so even with the loss of Sonny Gray, the group as a whole won’t have to do much to improve.  Despite lacking a true standout, ZiPS sees enough depth to piece together a reasonable staff. While it may be deep, the rotation is also lacking upside. Dustin May is the only starting pitcher expected to open in the rotation with a projected strikeout rate over 20%. The Cardinals bullpen performed exceptionally well in 2025, so there is a lot of regression baked into the 2026 outlook. Getting a few breakout performances and/or starters moving to the pen and seeing their stuff play up will be a huge factor in the team’s 2026 storyline. Overall, I didn’t see too many surprises in the projections, but a few that stood out to me were:\n\nHunter Dobbins is given a projection a little too close to Aaron Wilkerson for my liking. He will probably always be a pitch to contact guy, but he is going to need to strike out more than 15.8% of batters to make much of an impact.\n\nMichael McGreevy projects as the staff ace as the only starting pitcher with an ERA+ greater than 100 and is given a 20% chance of putting up a 3+ WAR season.\n\nJoJo Romero is projected for almost half the bullpen WAR at 0.9. Hopefully some general manager saw the ZiPS release and decided to increase the prospect value they are willing to offer…\n\nOn the position player side of things, you can see the hole at first base left by the Willson Contreras departure. The rest of the infield projects slightly better than last year’s projections and results. One thing to note here is that the Depth Charts page is only giving Wetherholt 371 plate appearances, so there is some upside there if he performs in line with his ZiPS projections and earns a full season’s worth of plate appearances. The outfield was projected to be terrible going into last season and was able to meaningfully underperform even from that baseline. Nootbaar and Scott get solid projections in left and center field. Walker is projected for 518 plate appearances, which surely will not happen if he struggles as much as last year.\n\nLooking a bit deeper at the individual player projections, Donovan, Nootbaar, Winn, and Burleson project about as expected. Winn’s offense backing up a bit in 2025 hurt his outlook, but that is made up for by his improved defensive projection. His 80th percentile outcome of a 4.5 WAR season seems a little light given that he was on track to eclipse that for most of last year before fading late while dealing with the knee injury.\n\nWhile the pitching projections didn’t offer many surprises, there were a bunch of position player projections that jumped out to me.\n\nJJ Wetherholt is projected for 2.9 WAR with a 100 OPS+ and above-average defense. While not flashy, this is an incredibly positive projection for a player with one full minor league season under his belt. ZiPS incorporates exit velocity data into the model, so it is good to see that Wetherholt was not knocked too much for his average performance on those metrics.\n\nIvan Herrera is projected for a 125 OPS+. Going into last season he was projected at 103, so it is good to see that the computer believes in his offensive breakout. The model does incorporate injury data, but I am assuming it is not aware of the saga around Herrera’s arm problems and his impassioned pursuit of the starting catcher role. If he is able to catch 80-100 games, I think he would easily surpass his 80th percentile WAR projection of 3.5.\n\nJordan Walker maybe shouldn’t be classified as a surprise, but you still hate to see a below replacement projection. The Cardinals still seem to believe in his upside and I am inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt as they try to sort through Walker’s issues.\n\nNolan Gorman projecting for 1.9 WAR and above-average defense was one of the biggest surprises for me. It will be interesting to see how much leeway he is given early in the year.\n\nJimmy Crooks is given a 2 WAR projection with an 89 OPS+. This was similar to the projection he received going into 2025. It is good to see that the computer still believes in him after a relatively lackluster AAA performance.\n\nNathan Church didn’t convince the computer that his 2025 breakout was for real, as he still projects below average offensively and defensively.\n\nBryan Torres has a steadily growing fan club and can now count ZiPS among his admirers with a 105 OPS+. His -8 defensive rating hurts his overall value projection and will be something to keep an eye on if he breaks camp with the Cardinals.\n\nFinally, a few prospects that don’t project to open in St. Louis but that had encouraging projections were:\n\nJoshua Baez getting a 94 OPS+ projection is super exciting. I was worried the computer would hold his high strikeout rate in the lower minors against him. He is projected for a 29% strikeout rate, so it is still a risky profile, but it also means there is more upside if he keeps the swing and miss in check as he moves up.\n\nDeniel Ortiz was one of the breakout offensive prospects of the 2025 season. A projected OPS+ of 81 is incredibly solid for a player who has not yet reached Double-A. It is good to see ZiPS is not overly concerned with his high strikeout rate.\n\nLeonardo Bernal continues to get love with a league average WAR projection. It is hard to see him getting much time this year, but he is still moving in the right direction.\n\nAll things considered, I am encouraged by where the projections landed. These aren’t the Cardinals from the last several decades that pump out 88+ win projections, but they still have the underlying attribute of depth that made those teams successful. Szymborski himself mentioned that this looks like a .500 team, which would surpass most fans’ expectations. I do think in all the talk of the rebuild, some fans are overlooking the importance of winning games in 2026. The Cardinals have a good farm system, but it is not the kind of system that can take a true-talent 70 win team and turn it into a World Series contender in a couple of years. If the 2026 team can meet or exceed the ZiPS expectations, the Cardinals will be primed for a competitive window moving forward.",

We appreciate the professionalism of all parties involved,” a spokesperson for the team told the media.\n\nLee’s agent, Scott Boras, told the San Francisco Chronicle it was “not anything political or anything like that.”\n\nDetentions by federal agents have become a hot-button issue amid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nLee arrived at LAX ahead of an appearance at the Giants’ FanFest in San Ramon on Saturday. The tour, which has multiple stops across Northern California, gives fans a chance to meet players and coaches.\n\nLee is of South Korean descent, but he was born in Nagoya, Japan, where his father, Korean baseball star Jong Beom Lee, was playing for the Chunichi Dragons, according to his MLB profile. During his introductory press conference, Lee called himself “Grandson of the Wind.” His father is known as “Son of the Wind.”\n\nLee made his debut in the majors in March 2024 after playing for the Kiwoom Heroes in Korea for seven years. Lee agreed to a six-year contract with the Giants worth $113 million in December 2023, ESPN reported, citing unnamed sources, at the time.\n\nThe Giants will begin spring training for the 2026 season in Scottsdale, Arizona, in early February.",

    "fullText": "Pitchers and catchers have their first workouts from February 9th to February 13th. This offseason saw many players move in the form of trades and free agency. As anticipation starts for the 2026 season, baseball fans are beginning to home in on their favorite teams.\n\nFans begin to research rosters, minor league prospects, and the 2026 schedules. Spring Training baseball brings hope to fans anxiously awaiting their favorite team to reach World Series glory. Here are the top 10 MLB teams heading into Spring Training.\n\nDetroit rosters MLB’s best starting pitcher in Tarik Skubal. The Tigers could trade their superstar if a long-term extension can’t be reached. If Skubal is traded, the Tigers will be in need of a number one starting pitcher.\n\nThe team’s lineup features young players and blossoming superstar Riley Greene. This offseason, the front office helped strengthen Detroit’s bullpen.\n\nLast season, Houston missed the playoffs for the first time since 2016. The team’s shortcomings were due to injuries, most notably to Yordan Alvarez and team closer Josh Hader. This offseason, the Astros added free agent Japanese pitcher Tatsuya Imai.\n\nImai joins Hunter Brown and Christian Javier in Houston’s starting rotation. The key to Houston’s upcoming season is health.\n\nOn paper, teams are better than the Brewers, but the front office and coaching staff get the best out of the team’s roster. Last season, Milwaukee’s top starting pitching prospect, Jacob Misiorowski, made his debut and took the league by storm.\n\nMisiorowski will join Freddie Peralta at the top of the team’s starting rotation. The Brewers’ lineup will again be led by Christian Yelich, Brice Turang, and last season’s breakout outfielder, Jackson Chourio.\n\nBoston was led by ace starting pitcher Garrett Crochet in 2025. The starter had the best season of his career and will produce more production in 2026. The team lost third baseman Alex Bregman in free agency, but the lineup features Trevor Story, Jarren Duran, Wilyer Abreu, Roman Anthony, and newly acquired hitter Willson Contreras.\n\nThe Red Sox bolstered their rotation, signing starting pitcher Sonny Gray. If Boston can successfully slide prospect Marcelo Mayer into Bregman’s void, they can reach the playoffs again in 2026.\n\nThe Yankees have the lineup to win the World Series, but continue to fall short. Any team with Aaron Judge will always have the chance to win. The Yankees haven’t made a splash in free agency, but the upcoming season will feature the return of starting pitcher Gerrit Cole.\n\nCole will rejoin the starting rotation that features Max Fried, Carlos Rodon, and breakout candidate Cam Schlitter. With Cody Bellinger locked up long-term, the glaring questions are whether shortstop Anthony Volpe can fix his consistency issues and if the pitching staff can stay healthy throughout the season.\n\nChicago started the first half of 2025 as one of MLB’s best teams. However, the Cubs regressed mightily in the second half. This offseason, the team lost outfielder Kyle Tucker in free agency but signed Alex Bregman to fill the glaring hole at third base. The front office acquired starting pitcher Edward Cabrera, and he will join starting pitchers Shota Imanaga, James Taillon, Cade Horton, and Matthew Boyd.\n\nStarting pitcher Justin Steele returns to the starting rotation after missing all of 2025 to elbow surgery. After outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong’s breakout season, the Cubs’ lineup is projected to be one of the strongest in Major League Baseball.\n\nBarring injuries, Seattle’s rotation has the chance to be one of the league’s best. It’s difficult to name a starting five better than the combination of Luis Castillo, Logan Gilbert, Bryan Woo, George Kirby, and Bryce Miller. The group makes up the best strength of the Mariners’ roster.\n\nThey came up short during last season’s playoff push but brings back a lineup that features Cal Raleigh, Josh Naylor, Randy Arozarena, and Julio Rodriguez. Seattle will be the team to beat in the AL West.\n\nThe Phillies are the best National League team to dethrone the Los Angeles Dodgers. Last season, Philadelphia fell to Los Angeles in the NLDS. Unfortunately, the team was without starting pitcher Zack Wheeler and is likely to begin 2026 without its ace. With Ranger Suarez leaving in free agency, the Phillies will look to Christopher Sanchez, Aaron Nola, and Jesus Luzardo as their top three starters.\n\nProspect Andrew Painter will have the opportunity to break Spring Training in the rotation, and he has one of the best arms of any minor league prospect. Philadelphia’s lineup returns veterans J.T. Realmuto, Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Kyle Schwarber, and free agent acquisition Adolis Garcia. Outfielder Nick Castellanos is likely to be traded before Spring Training.\n\nToronto was one of MLB’s top teams throughout the 2025 season. The Blue Jays represented the American League in the World Series but fell to the Dodgers in seven games. This season, Toronto looks to repeat as American League pennant winners. Its starting pitching rotation of Kevin Gausman, Dylan Cease, Shane Bieber, Jose Berrios, and postseason standout Trey Yesavage can be one of the top rotations in MLB.\n\nThey added to their lineup this season, adding Japanese free agent Kazuma Okamoto. The team hopes Okamoto will mitigate lost production following shortstop Bo Bichette’s signing with the Mets. The Japanese free agent will be included in a lineup that features Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Anthony Santander, Addison Barger, Daulton Varsho, and George Springer.\n\nLA enters Spring Training as the top team in Major League Baseball. Their roster features Shohei Ohtani, the league’s best player, and they added Kyle Tucker as a free agent.\n\nTucker joins the best lineup, top to bottom, and is positioned to have the best season of his career. If the starting rotation can stay healthy, the group of Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow, Blake Snell, Roki Sasaki, and Shohei Ohtani can finish as the league’s top-ranked staff.\n\nThe front office brought in free agent closer Edwin Diaz to secure the ninth inning of ball games. For all the negative talk about the front office’s spending, one thing is clear: team ownership wants to win every season.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post Ranking the top 10 MLB teams entering 2026 Spring Training appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "A Chicago Cubs-centric digest, with #Cubs, #MLB, and #MiLB content.",
    "fullText": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow the various narrative paths.\n\n“Maybe I called it wrong, but it’s official.” — Tom Connolly, HoF Umpire.\n\nHappy Birthday to Mike Krukow*, farewell Hollywood Stars, and other stories for the discerning reader.\n\n1921 – 1921 – Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis officially is signed as baseball commissioner, to a seven-year, $350,000 contract. (1,2)\n\n1936 – The Hollywood Stars, last-place finishers in the Pacific Coast League in 1935, move to San Diego, where they will become the Padres. The Stars were unable to pay the annual rent of $8,000 for Wrigley Field. They will return in 1938 when the San Francisco Missions move south to L.A. (2)\n\n1947 – A rule change that allows voting only for players who were active after 1921 produces four new Hall of Fame members, breaking a logjam after years of the BBWAA electing hardly anyone: catcher Mickey Cochrane, second baseman Frankie Frisch, and pitchers Lefty Grove and Carl Hubbell, all former Most Valuable Players and World Series winners. Pie Traynor misses selection by two votes. Hubbell was forbidden by Ty Cobb to throw his screwball in Detroit’s farm system, but used it to win 253 games for the New York Giants; Frisch went to the World Series eight times and batted .316 over 19 seasons; Grove won 300 games, and his battery-mate Cochrane retired with a .320 lifetime batting average, the highest of any catcher. (1,2)\n\n1953 – The Baseball Writers Association of America passes over Joe DiMaggio in his first year of eligibility and elects pitcher Dizzy Dean and outfielder Al Simmons to the Hall of Fame. Dean gathers 209 votes while Simmons’ total of 199 is one more than needed. The colorful Dean had a .644 career winning percentage and won 120 games from 1932 through 1936, including 30 wins in 1934. Simmons, who drove in 100 runs in each of his first eleven major league seasons, was one of the most feared hitters of his time. Also joining DiMaggio, who finishes eighth in the voting, are in order Bill Terry, Bill Dickey, Rabbit Maranville, Dazzy Vance, Ted Lyons, Charles Bender (ninth) and Gabby Hartnett (tenth). All will eventually make it. DiMaggio’s low total can be explained by the fact that there is no actual ballot, only write-in votes, and it is not clear whether DiMaggio is eligible since he played his last game only two years earlier. (1,2)\n\n1993 – Hall of Fame second baseman Charlie Gehringer dies at the age of 89, one month after suffering a stroke. During a 19-year career with the Detroit Tigers, Gehringer posted a .320 batting average with 184 home runs and 1427 RBI. In 1937, he enjoyed arguably his finest season, leading the American League with a .371 average. (2)\n\nCubs Birthdays: Mike Krukow*, Dave Smith, Alan Benes.\n\n1522 – Head Inquisitor Adrian Florisz Boeyens is elected pope.\n\n1793 – Louis XVI of France is executed by guillotine in Paris, following his conviction for “high treason” by the newly created French Parliament (Convention nationale), during the French Revolution.\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nSome of these items spread from site to site without being fact-checked, and that is why we ask for verifiable sources, in order to help correct the record.",

    "description": "The United Shore Professional Baseball League (USPBL), an independent league based in Michigan, is recruiting players in order to \"build the ability to pitch deep into games.\" Can it be done?",
    "fullText": "The independent minor leagues are baseball’s laboratories.\n\nPitch clocks? The robot umpires coming to the major leagues this year? The home run derby used to settle ties, as seen in last year’s All-Star Game? All first tested in an independent league.\n\nSome concepts are hits. Some are flops.\n\nThe experiment to watch this year is almost spiritual in nature: Can professional baseball make starting pitching great again?\n\nBaseball’s obsession with velocity has dampened the soul of the sport. The marquee pitching matchup is an endangered species. The oohs and aahs over a 100-mph pitch have been replaced by yawns.\n\nThe potential solution, or at least a piece of one, is evident in this job description:\n\nThe United Shore Professional Baseball League (USPBL), an independent league based in Michigan, is recruiting for the position of “primary starting pitcher.”\n\nThe game isn’t building traditional starters anymore. At the @uspbl, were changing that.\n\nWe are actively recruiting Primary Starting Pitchers who want to take the ball every week, pitch deep into games, and become the durable, innings-capable arms MLB organizations need.\n\nThis… pic.twitter.com/0JZvXEFsqW\n\n— Justin Orenduff (@JustinOrenduff) December 1, 2025\n\nThe language is intentional. In today’s major leagues, a starting pitcher generally is selected, trained and deployed to throw as hard as he can for as long as he can. Five innings is perfectly acceptable, with a parade of harder-throwing reinforcements in the bullpen.\n\nWhat the USPBL plans for a primary starting pitcher: “Build the ability to pitch deep into games.”\n\nThat used to be self-evident for a starting pitcher, but no longer. Yoshinobu Yamamoto turned into Sandy Koufax last October, with back-to-back complete games during the Dodgers’ championship run.\n\nHowever, in the regular season, the Dodgers did not throw a complete game, and neither did 12 other teams. The Dodgers’ starters averaged 4.85 innings per game; no team averaged even six innings.\n\nIn 2025, three major league pitchers threw 200 innings. In 2010, 45 did.\n\n“Being able to get more Mark Buehrles or Cliff Lees back into the fold would be good for the game,” said Justin Orenduff, a 2004 Dodgers first-round draft pick and now the USPBL executive director of baseball strategy and development.\n\nBuehrle, a five-time All-Star, and Lee, a four-time All-Star, each featured precision rather than power.\n\nLee, twice a Game 1 World Series starter, did not average 92 mph on his fastball but pitched 200 innings eight times. Buerhle, whose average fastball did not top 90 mph, pitched 200 innings for 14 consecutive years.\n\nNeither might be drafted today. Major league teams crave velocity, and young pitchers train to boost it. The number of players throwing at least 95 mph at the Perfect Game national showcase increased sevenfold from 2014 to 2024, according to a report from Major League Baseball.\n\nThe average MLB fastball rose from 91 mph in 2008 to 94 mph in 2024, the report said.\n\n“Velocity is the No. 1 predictor of success,” Billy Eppler, then the Angels’ general manager, told me in 2018.\n\nVelocity also is associated with an increased risk of injury. Teams have implemented well-intentioned measures — pitch counts, innings limits, more rest between appearances — that have not mitigated the risks and might well have led to more injuries.\n\nKyle Boddy, the founder of Driveline, the seminal program for velocity training, said a hard-throwing pitcher is not going to manage his velocity on an inflexible pitch count.\n\n“If he goes 60 or 70 pitches, he’s going to sit 100,” Boddy told Baseball America. “He’s not stupid. And if we tell him, ‘There’s no limits on you,’ but we keep taking him out after 70 pitches every time, he’s going to realize what’s going on.\n\n“If he can’t control the volume, the one lever he can control is the intensity. I personally think that’s worse for his arm, going max effort for shorter stints.”\n\nThat ultimately works against developing starting pitchers capable of delivering six innings, the MLB report said.\n\n“Modern workload management strategies — ostensibly intended to prevent overuse, protect pitcher health, and maximize pitcher effectiveness — may actually increase injury risk by allowing and even incentivizing pitchers to throw with maximum effort on every pitch,” the report said, “rather than requiring pitchers to conserve energy and pace themselves in an effort to pitch through longer outings.”\n\nNot only does throwing harder increase the risk of injury, the MLB report said, but the resulting parade of strikeouts runs “counter to contact-oriented approaches that create more balls in play and result in the type of on-field action that fans want to see.”\n\nIn the independent Atlantic League, the league has run several years of testing on a “double hook” rule: when a team removes its starting pitcher, it loses its designated hitter. That would incentivize a major league team to use its starter for six or seven innings instead of four or five, but it would not solve the underlying problem: What if the starting pitcher cannot work six or seven innings?\n\nThat is where Orenduff and the USPBL come in.\n\nEvery general manager says he would love a rotation of five 200-inning starters, if only he could find them. They cannot offer on-the-job training in the majors, lest their team find itself at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIn an independent league, Orenduff need not worry about that. Tough matchup with the bases loaded in the fourth inning? Third time through the order in the sixth inning? Pitch through it.\n\n“It’s not going to be that quick pull,” he said.\n\nThis is not about leaving a starting pitcher out there to get crushed just to pitch through it. This is about shaking off the shackles of those one-size-fits-all limitations.\n\n“You basically want to start by showing fans and the industry, for example, that 100 pitches is just a number,” he said. “It’s completely arbitrary.\n\n“Some guys may be able to go 110, 120. We want to be able to show that the game can still produce players that are successful on the mound, most importantly, but are capable of going beyond the fifth inning and beyond 100 pitches if the expectation and the leadership and the structure are there to support it.”\n\nThe USPBL will have pretty much the same technology as major league teams do, to measure spin rates and recovery rates and every other rate. If you can maintain command and velocity, if you can get outs without max effort on every pitch, and if you can bounce back between innings and between starts, you may be able to be that primary starting pitcher.\n\nFrankly, Orenduff says, all the velocity in the world cannot help your team if you cannot pitch.\n\n“That has to be a metric too: sustainability and availability,” he said.\n\nHe conducted a study evaluating each team’s top three pitching draft picks since 2013. With the caveats that some pitchers were traded and some prospects still are developing, Orenduff found that three in four of those top drafted pitchers never have pitched for the major league team that drafted them, at a combined cost to the 30 MLB teams of $800 million in signing bonuses.\n\n“We just have to have some sort of proof we can help more players have longer careers by being a little more flexible in how we frame things for them,” Orenduff said.\n\nHere’s hoping the USPBL can discover some training methods that major league teams can use. Better that than listening to a major league manager with a 13-man pitching staff say after a game that he ran out of pitchers, as we too often hear. Can you imagine what Tommy Lasorda would have to say about that?\n\n Delivered at the start of each series.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees are entering the final phase of Aaron Judge’s prime, but their front office isn’t acting like it this offseason.\n\nNew York’s ongoing talks with Cody Bellinger (who might land elsewhere) are happening within the context of a painfully underwhelming offseason for Yankees fans.\n\nFirst, the Yankees were blindsided by Trent Grisham accepting his qualifying offer. Their acquisitions and retentions since then have been marginal at best: Amed Rosario, Ryan Yarbrough, Paul Blackburn, and Ryan Weathers.\n\nWhile the Baltimore Orioles have been killing it this offseason, and with the Toronto Blue Jays making some big moves as well, the Yankees look ridiculous with how inactive they’ve been. The Boston Red Sox were more or less quiet for awhile, but even their offseason has been miles better than New York’s, especially now that they’ve added Ranger Suárez.\n\nBleacher Report’s Zachary D. Rymer recently wrote an article talking about the MLB teams who have had the worst offseason, and the Yankees were at the top of his list.\n\n“(The Yankees) seem to be treating their offseason shopping as an optional exercise,” Rymer wrote on Wednesday. “Even bringing back Cody Bellinger, which should be a lay-up, is proving difficult.\n\n… These are the Yankees we’re talking about. No move is supposed to be too big, so no fan should be forgiving of how they’ve made only small moves so far.”\n\n“The Yankees actually project as the fourth-best team in MLB this year, but those projections are taking a lot on faith with question marks like Anthony Volpe, Austin Wells and even Giancarlo Stanton,” Rymer continued. “In other words, the last thing the Yankees should be thinking is that they can leave good enough alone.”\n\nTwo AL East Teams Reportedly Still In On Framber Valdez",

    "fullText": "When the New York Mets signed Bo Bichette on Friday to a three-year, $126 million deal, many MLB fans (particularly those rooting for the New York Yankees) assumed that the Mets halt their pursuit of Cody Bellinger.\n\nThat’s not what’s happening, according to New York Mets On SI’s Pat Ragazzo.\n\n“The Mets are still in play for free agent first baseman/outfielder Cody Bellinger, as sources told Mets On SI on Friday,” Ragazzo wrote.\n\n“The versatile Bellinger fits the Mets at multiple positions given his above average defense at first base and in center and left field. Bellinger’s left-handed bat would also provide added protection in the Mets’ lineup for Francisco Lindor, Juan Soto and Bichette. Bellinger also has a .929 career OPS at Citi Field in 20 games.”\n\n“The Mets could plug Bellinger in center or left field, or at first base if they aren’t comfortable playing Jorge Polanco and Brett Baty at the position,” Ragazzo added.\n\nBellinger has carved out a dynamic nine-year MLB career marked by peaks and valleys. Debuting with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017, he earned Rookie of the Year honors with 39 home runs. His 2019 MVP season saw him smash 47 homers while batting .305, followed by a 2020 World Series title. Injuries hampered him in 2021-22, leading to a non-tender and a rebound with the Chicago Cubs in 2023 (.307 average, 26 homers). In 2024, he hit .266 with 18 long balls before opting out of his deal.\n\nBellinger’s 2025 campaign with the Yankees represented a strong resurgence, batting .272 with 29 home runs, 98 RBIs, and 13 stolen bases in 152 games. He posted an .813 OPS, 125 wRC+, and delivered memorable moments like a three-homer game against the Cubs, aiding the Yankees’ playoff push.\n\nBellinger remains a free agent, with ongoing talks stalled over contract length (he seeks seven years, while New York offers five at $155-160 million).\n\nBo Bichette Signing Creates Perfect Trade Fit For Red Sox",

    "fullText": "1922 \nBlack Sox member Buck Weaver petitioned for reinstatement into baseball. The former White Sox third baseman was one of eight players banned for life due to his involvement in throwing the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nThough Weaver was the most innocent of the Black Sox, he did attend at least two meetings in which the specifics of throwing the Series were discussed. It went uncontested that Weaver took no money from gamblers and played at his full potential for the entire Series.\n\nHowever, Judge Landis did not yield, turning down Weaver’s application.\n\n1927 \nTo make room for the up-and-coming Tony Lazzeri, the Yankees sent second baseman Aaron Ward to Chicago for catcher Johnny Grabowski and second baseman Ray Moreheart.\n\nWhile Ward played just one year for the White Sox — at 30, his final full year in the bigs — the South Siders got the better end of this deal. Ward put up a .270/.360/.391 as a regular, good for a 96 OPS+ and 2.1 WAR. Moreheart played in 73 games with a .681 OPS and 0.7 WAR, while Grabowski would have a -1.1 WAR in 167 games over the next three years in the Bronx.\n\nOn the other hand, Grabowski and Moreheart both got to play on one of the best teams in MLB history, the Murderer’s Row Yankees who went 110-44-1 and swept the Pirates in the 1927 World Series.\n\n1991 \nIt’s not often you’ll see an NFL item in our daily history, but this one has resonance.\n\nIn a playoff game for the Oakland Raiders vs. the Cincinnati Bengals, running back Bo Jackson suffered a season-ending, and career-threatening, leg injury. Initially said to be a pulled thigh muscle, Jackson’s setback is much more significant, necessitating surgery — and eventually, a hip replacement.\n\nWhen Bo’s baseball club at the time (he was a two-sport player), the Kansas City Royals, learned of the severity of his injury, he was released. Two weeks later, the White Sox snatched him up, believing in Jackson’s determination to rehab his injury and stage a baseball comeback. The outfielder sat out the entire 1992 season before making his return to the field — with an artificial hip — on April 9, 1993.\n\nHis first at-bat resulted in a pinch-hit home run.\n\n1995 \nBaseball’s executive council voted to allow replacement players in upcoming Spring Training and regular season games, given the ongoing labor impasse with the MLBPA. The more prominent scabs who briefly would become White Sox were shortstop Kent Anderson, outfielder Shawn Buchanan, starting pitcher Oil Can Boyd, outfielder Al Chambers, reliever John Davis, catcher Bill Lindsey, catcher Junior Ortiz and third baseman Pete Rose Jr.\n\nRecall that this is the decision that would eventually drive aspiring major-leaguer Michael Jordan from his baseball career.\n\n2020 \nPunishments were handed down to the Astros as a result of their trash can scandal, which allowed Houston to cheat its way to a World Series title in 2017. While NO players were punished, GM Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch were suspended for a season (and subsequently fired by the Astros). Houston also had to pay a $5 million fine and lose its twp two picks in the 2020 and 2021 drafts.\n\nWhy is this a White Sox item? Because Chicago reliever Danny Farquhar, during a September 2017 game in Houston, heard the trash can and unearthed the scandal, calling catcher Kevan Smith out to change the signs and foil the plot. The story didn’t break because no one picked up on what happened; Farquhar admitted later that he was sitting at his locker postgame just waiting to tell his story … but no one asked.",

    "fullText": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow the various narrative paths.\n\n“Maybe I called it wrong, but it’s official.” — Tom Connolly, HoF Umpire.\n\nHappy birthday to Bill Madlock*,  it’s drafty in here, and other stories for the discerning reader,\n\n1887 – The New York Metropolitans (American Association) buy third baseman Dude Esterbrook from the New York Giants (NL). Although the Mets are no longer owned by the Giants’ management, the Giants still seem to get the best of every deal between the two clubs. (2)\n\n1900 – Baltimore Orioles manager John McGraw threatens that if the National League drops the Orioles, which are controlled by the owners of the Brooklyn Superbas, he will form an American League team. Two weeks later the NL Circuit Committee recommends buying out Baltimore, Washington, Cleveland, and Louisville and going to an eight-team league. McGraw then organizes a Baltimore club in the AL, which is still a minor league circuit at this point, albeit one with bigger ambitions. (2)\n\n1920 – A plan developed by Charles Ebbets many years ago is finally adopted: the annual drafting of players from the minor leagues will be done in inverse order of the final standings. (1,2)\n\n1921 – Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis takes over his new role as Commissioner of baseball. Landis, who is given wide-ranging powers, replaces the three-man National Commission that had been running the game for nearly two decades. (2)\n\n1950 – The New York Yankees sell their Newark Bears franchise to the Chicago Cubs, who will move the team to Springfield, Massachusetts. The once-proud Bears, owned by the Yankees since 1932, finished last in the International League in 1949. (2)\n\n1961 – Charlie Grimm and Verlon Walker are named to the Chicago Cubs College of Coaches. Using this system, a different coach will manage the team each month during the season, and members of the group will move between the major league team and its minor league affiliates. (2)\n\n1982 – In the January draft, the Blue Jays use the #1 pick on OF Kash Beauchamp and the Cubs follow by taking C Troy Afenir. But the Twins, picking third, strike gold when they take OF Kirby Puckett. Meanwhile, the Reds choose P Randy Myers in the first round while the Mets select OF Kal Daniels in the third round. The 433rd pick overall is OF John Cangelosi, taken by the White Sox. (2)\n\n2018 – The Blue Jays sign 3B Josh Donaldson to one-year deal worth $23 million. It is the largest salary ever given to a player eligible for salary arbitration, besting the $21.6 million given to Bryce Harper by the Nationals last May. Donaldson’s is not the only record-setting deal signed today: the Cubs offer 3B Kris Bryant $10.85 million, the most ever for a player eligible for arbitration for the first time. (2)\n\nCubs Birthdays: George Browne, Roy Easterwood, Phil Mudrock, Paul Reuschel, Bill Madlock*,\n\n475 – Basiliscus becomes Byzantine Emperor, with a coronation ceremony in the Hebdomon palace in Constantinople.\n\n1554 – Bayinnaung is crowned King of Burma, assembles the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia.\n\n1812 – First cargo arrives in New Orleans by steamboat from Natchez.\n\n1906 – First time Dow Jones Industrial Average closes above 100 (100.26).\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nSome of these items spread from site to site without being fact-checked, and that is why we ask for verifiable sources, in order to help correct the record.",

    "fullText": "We’re not all that far off now from spring training. Just one month remains until pitchers and catchers report to camp. But this MLB offseason feels anything but complete.\n\nPlenty of top-tier free agents have yet to sign anywhere. Of MLB Trade Rumors’ top 10 ranked FAs, half of them remain on the market: Kyle Tucker (#1), Bo Bichette (#2), Framber Valdez (#6), Cody Bellinger (#8), and Ranger Suárez (#10). And #5 on that list, Alex Bregman, just joined the Cubs two days ago.\n\nThere’s a lot of great talent still available for whichever teams are willing to pay for it. Orioles fans, of course, are hoping that Baltimore is one of those teams. Valdez or Suárez, the two pitchers on that list, are the most sensible fits for the Birds. But hey, why stop there? I’ve been beating the Kyle Tucker drum this offseason and I’m not going to stop now, even though the O’s acquired Taylor Ward earlier this winter. I say if you have the financial wherewithal to add a premium free agent — which the Orioles do, if the Pete Alonso signing is any indication — then you might as well be in discussions with all the top guys, even if they’re not an obvious fit on the roster. Sign Tucker to play right field, and you could have Dylan Beavers back up at all three outfield positions. I’m not particularly concerned about what would happen to Tyler O’Neill in that scenario.\n\nHeck, sign Bo Bichette to play second base. You could move Jackson Holliday to, I don’t know, center field? Or go ahead and swipe Cody Bellinger out from under the Yankees’ noses. He’s not the defensive center fielder he once was, but I’d probably trust him more than Colton Cowser out there, and he’s certainly a better hitter.\n\nMaybe I’m only being half-serious with these suggestions. The O’s don’t have unlimited cash and would probably prefer to stick to the more realistic options. But can anyone say they’d truly be upset if the O’s came out of nowhere and landed someone like Tucker, Bichette, or Bellinger, in addition to one of the pitchers? What an offseason that would be.\n\nSo go ahead, Orioles. You’ve got a month left to do something truly awesome. Let’s have some fun, shall we?\n\nCan Bradfield be Orioles’ Opening Day centerfielder? | MAILBAG – BaltimoreBaseball.com\n\nThis mailbag question comes from someone who did not follow Bradfield’s 2025 season, I suppose. Rich Dubroff rightly responds that there’s no chance of it happening.\n\nAs solid offseason winds down, is there pressure on O’s to add one more starter? – Steve Melewski\n\nDepends what you mean by “pressure.” I don’t think Elias will be fired or anything if he doesn’t add another starter. But I hope he’s prepared for Orioles fans to angrily voice their displeasure on the internet. Take that, Mike!\n\nThis, that and the other – School of Roch\n\nGunnar Henderson is hyped about the World Baseball Classic. You and me both, Gunnar.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! Six former Orioles were born on this day, including (Na Na Na-Na-Na) Kim! Hyun! Soo!, who turns 38. After his brief MLB stint with the Birds from 2016-17, Kim is still going strong in the Korea Baseball Organization, spending the past eight years with the LG Twins. Other ex-O’s celebrating Jan. 12 birthdays are right-handers Chris Ray (44) and Luis Ayala (48), infielders Tim Hulett (66) and Juan Bonilla (70), and lefty Paul Gilliford (81).\n\nOn this date in 2007, the Orioles traded righty Rodrigo López to the Rockies for two prospects. López had been a solid starter for the O’s for five seasons, averaging more than 180 innings per year and thrice serving as the Opening Day starter. He was the AL Rookie of the Year runner-up in 2002. In his last season with the Birds, though, López led the league in both losses (18) and earned runs allowed (124).",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Diamondbacks will not trade second baseman Ketel Marte, general manager Mike Hazen said on Friday, Jan. 9, bringing an end to months of discussions about a possible deal.\n\nThe club had explored the possibility of a trade in the hopes of bringing back younger, cheaper players. A deal also would have shed payroll that could have then been reallocated.\n\nHazen has said over the past month that he did not want the talks to drag much beyond the start of the year. He wanted to turn his focus to finding other ways to upgrade his roster.\n\nThe Diamondbacks seemed interested in making a deal happen if the right one presented itself. Apparently, one never did.\n\nOne possible reason was that the club was said to have had a high asking price that rival clubs were reluctant to reach. Teams also might have preferred to take their chances on the free-agent market, which still features several unsigned star position players.\n\nAnother possibility is that clubs were concerned about Marte’s makeup and fit in a new clubhouse, particularly after he upset teammates by missing games after the All-Star break last year following a break-in at his Scottsdale home, an incident for which he later apologized.\n\nKeeping Marte, of course, is far from a bad outcome for the Diamondbacks. He has been the best second baseman in the majors over the past few seasons, accumulating 16 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), per Baseball-Reference, the most at the position.\n\nIt could, however, make it more difficult for the club to shore up its pitching staff.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have rounded out their rotation this winter by bringing back free-agent Merrill Kelly and signing veteran Michael Soroka, but the bullpen, a major trouble spot in recent seasons, remains unchanged and in need of upgrades.\n\nHazen has said he remains engaged in the free-agent and trade markets in search of bullpen help.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Ketel Marte trade won't happen despite rumors, Diamondbacks GM says",

Main Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States. At the news conference, MLB staff assembled duffel bags with goods for foster care children.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "description": "The MLB team formerly known as the Oakland Athletics may not be able to call itself the Las Vegas Athletics when it moves to Sin City.",
    "fullText": "Athletics pitcher Mason Miller throws to the Baltimore Orioles during the ninth inning of a baseball game Sunday, June 8, 2025, in West Sacramento, Calif. \n\nThe MLB team formerly known as the Oakland Athletics may not be able to call itself the Las Vegas Athletics when it moves to Sin City.\n\nThe A’s played their final season in Oakland in 2024. As they wait to finalize plans on a move to Vegas, the team has been using a Minor League field in Sacramento as their temporary home.\n\nShould the move to Vegas be completed, however, the team may have a different name. As pointed out by attorney Josh Gerben on his blog, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied multiple requests from the team, including for “Las Vegas Athletics” and “Vegas Athletics.” The trademarks were denied due to the names being deemed too generic.\n\nAccording to the USPTO, the dominant portion of each mark refers to a well-known geographic location (Las Vegas) while the remaining wording, ‘Athletics,’ lacks distinctiveness as applied to the goods and services identified in the applications.\n\nThe examining attorney noted that “athletics” is defined as “activities such as sports, exercises, and games that require physical skill and stamina,” and concluded that the term directly describes “the purpose and feature of the applicant’s goods and services.” As a result, the USPTO found that the marks merely describe a professional sports team located in Las Vegas rather than functioning as unique indicators of source.\n\nIn an effort to persuade the USPTO, the team pointed to decades of using the name “Athletics” throughout its history. The office, however, stood firm in its ruling.\n\nGerben added that he believes the Athletics will ultimately secure the trademark, noting that such an issue is rarely seen among professional sports teams.\n\nThe post The A’s Just Hit a Massive Speed Bump on Their Move to Las Vegas first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The Cincinnati Reds should not trade their starting catcher Tyler Stephenson.",
    "fullText": "As the Cincinnati Reds weigh their options heading into the 2026 season, one of the more debated topics has been whether the team should consider moving catcher Tyler Stephenson. While the Reds are operating on a limited payroll and have another capable catcher on the roster, trading Stephenson would be a mistake for several reasons.\n\nFirst, his backup, Jose Trevino, is best suited for a defensive role rather than as a full-time starter. Trevino has earned both a Gold Glove and a Platinum Glove Award, proving his value behind the plate, but his bat remains a liability. He is most effective as a defensive replacement or in spot starts, not as the everyday catcher. That reality underscores Stephenson’s importance, as he provides offensive production that is rare to find at the position.\n\nStephenson’s versatility also adds value. Beyond catching, he has the ability to play first base, giving manager Terry Francona flexibility in constructing lineups. For a team trying to maximize resources, having a player who can fill multiple roles is critical. Trading him simply to address other areas of the roster would weaken the team’s depth and reduce options in the infield.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Stephenson’s trade value is not at its peak. He is coming off a down year for his standards in which he hit .231 with a .316 on-base percentage, .737 OPS, 13 home runs and 50 RBIs. Moving him now would mean selling low, rather than waiting for him to rebound to the level he showed in 2024, when he was a key offensive piece.\n\nStephenson will be entering his seventh year with the Reds after being drafted 11th overall in the 2015 MLB Draft. His connection to the organization and fanbase adds intangible value that cannot be overlooked. As a homegrown player who has delivered memorable moments, he embodies the team’s identity and helps drive fan engagement, which is vital for a franchise looking to sustain momentum and build its culture.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, keeping Stephenson allows the Reds to develop younger catchers at a natural pace. He can serve as a bridge until a long-term successor is ready, rather than forcing a premature transition. His combination of above-average offense for his position, defensive leadership and clubhouse stability makes a compelling case for Cincinnati to hold onto him.\n\nTrading Stephenson might seem like a quick fix, but in reality, the Reds are better positioned to contend by keeping him in the fold.",

The longer Boston waits, the more likely it becomes that another team will swoop in and sign him.\n\nThe Red Sox may not be the frontrunner for Bregman anymore, either, based on Mark Feinsand’s report for MLB.com on Thursday. According to Feinsand, the Arizona Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays “may be the two most aggressive clubs in the hunt for Bregman,” although a reunion with Boston is still possible.\n\nWhere things stand with top 6 @MLB free agents https://t.co/ta8jzvhgDX\n\n— Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) January 2, 2026\n\nFeinsand adds that the Red Sox and Blue Jays are both competing for Bichette as well. Accordingly, the free-agent decisions of Bregman and Bichette are closely related.\n\nIf Bregman returns to Boston, Toronto becomes more likely to re-sign Bichette and vice versa. If Bregman joins the Blue Jays, the Red Sox may counter by signing Bichette.\n\nBoston can be flexible thanks to Marcelo Mayer’s defensive versatility. If Bregman leaves, the Red Sox could put him at third base and sign Bichette to play second base. If Bregman stays, Mayer can man second.\n\nIt depends on which of the two All-Stars signs first, and where. Regardless, it sounds like there’s a high likelihood of them either returning to their teams or switching teams with each other, the latter of which would make things even more interesting in the AL East.\n\nRed Sox Fans Get Concerning Update In Alex Bregman Sweepstakes",

Now, MLB.com’s analyst Jared Greenspan and Theo DeRosa linked the Red Sox to Eugenio Suarez if the team can’t land either Bregman or Bichette.\n\n“Boston could still use another impact bat,” the two wrote in an article published on Thursday. “Among the top remaining free-agent hitters, shortstop Bo Bichette and outfielders Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger aren’t the most natural fits for the Red Sox.\n\n“But re-signing third baseman Alex Bregman would be an obvious move. If Bregman signs elsewhere, slugger Eugenio Suarez could be a fallback option.”\n\nSuarez would be an impact bat for Boston and could play third base and hit in the middle of the order. The slugger split last season between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Seattle Mariners, and he hit 49 home runs with 118 RBIs. The 49 home runs tied his career-high back in 2019.\n\nThe Red Sox have also been linked to Ketel Marte in trade talks, but it’s uncertain if the Diamondbacks will move him.\n\nRegardless of who it ends up being, adding a bat is likely the priority for the Red Sox after shoring up their pitching staff this offseason.\n\nSo far this offseason, Boston has acquired first baseman Willson Contreras and pitchers Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo in three separate trades.\n\nRed Sox Fans Shouldn’t Forget About These Two Vital Extensions",

    "fullText": "MLB.com | Brian Murphy: Tatsuya Imai, the top NPB player on the free agent market, is reportedly meeting with teams in Los Angeles ahead of his Friday afternoon deadline to sign. It’s unclear whether the Yankees are among those teams meeting in-person with Imai, though reports still link them, along with the Phillies and White Sox, to the right-hander. Imai, just 27-years-old, posted a 1.92 ERA over 163.2 innings in NPB last season, and may command a nine-figure guarantee.\n\nNew York Daily News | Peter Sblendorio: Now that the first quarter of the 21st century is in the books, the Daily News picked their All-Century New York team, selecting the best player from the last 25 years for each of New York’s teams. The top Yankee? None other than Aaron Judge. Judge had to beat out Derek Jeter, who won two World Series and racked up over 2,600 hits in the 2000’s, Alex Rodriguez, who won two MVP’s as a Yankee in the 21st century, and many other greats, but it’s clear that Judge’s resume has no peer. There are some debates with the other NY teams as well; Jalen Brunson, who’s played just 3.5 seasons in New York, is the Knicks’ All-Century selection, while Michael Strahan gets the nod over Eli Manning for the Giants.\n\nMLB.com | Sarah Langs: To close out 2025, the great Sarah Langs highlighted at least one amazing stat for each team from last season. For the Yankees, it of course came from Aaron Judge. Judge led MLB in batting average, OBP, and slugging percentage, the triple-slash triple crown, becoming just the fifth man in the expansion era to do so. He also set a record with 20 first-inning home runs.",

    "fullText": "MLB’s history of steroid use continues to provoke controversy as a discussion related to Hall of Fame candidacy. The juiciest debates of all concern all-time great talents who have been kept out of the Hall due to their evidence-based connection to steroids.\n\nFormer Boston Red Sox greats Manny Ramirez and Roger Clemens are two examples of such players who have been kept out of the HOF due to their link to performance-enhancing substances.\n\nMeanwhile, more nuanced discussions on the topic in recent years have pointed out that there are multiple guys already in the Hall who have been linked to steroids, if not officially condemned with evidence.\n\nESPN’s astute MLB analyst Paul Hembekides explained where his line is drawn (during a recent podcast), and it makes a lot of sense.\n\nFor Hembekides, if you were an MLB player caught using performance enhancement drugs after mandatory testing was implemented in 2004, you don’t deserve Hall of Fame entry. However, by that same token, Hembekides doesn’t believe that players like Clemens who used steroids during the height of usage (and prior to testing) should be banned from the Hall.\n\nMajor League Baseball was a testing-free league from 1986 until 2004.\n\nHolding Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens to the same standard as players in the testing era is intellectually dishonest. pic.twitter.com/XNrXMkBtpo\n\n— Paul Hembekides (Hembo) (@PaulHembo) December 29, 2025\n\n“These are complicated decisions that writers and that voters need to make, (and) I’ve kind of made my piece with the fact that if you’ve tested positive, or we have clear reason to believe that you did (use) steroids after the testing was in place, then you’re out for me,” Hembekides said.\n\n“So count me out on Manny (Ramirez) and count me out on A-Rod,” Hembekides continued. “But Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, best we can tell, started using steroids at the peak of the steroid era, and the biggest mistake that they made was being so much greater than their peers.”\n\nSteroids were first banned in MLB in 1991 when commissioner Fay Vincent issued a memo, but there was no testing established. In 2003, MLB and the players’ union agreed to anonymous testing to gauge the prevalence of steroid usage. When more than five percent of these tests came back positive, MLB made a move to implement mandatory testing (with penalties), which began in 2004. This is the line in the sand referred to by Hembekides.\n\nIn 2013, MLB started testing for human growth hormone using blood samples.\n\nRed Sox’s Marcelo Mayer Makes Notable Jersey Number Change",

MLB insider Francys Romero reported that the Pirates are one of four teams showing interest in Moncada.\n\n“Several teams, including the Angels, Pirates, White Sox, and Blue Jays, have shown early interest in free-agent third baseman Yoan Moncada, per sources,” Romero wrote on X on Friday. “Despite thumb and knee issues, Moncada had a solid 2025 and could contribute even more next season among third basemen.”\n\nMoncada spent last season with the Los Angeles Angels after spending one year with the Boston Red Sox and eight years with the Chicago White Sox. The Red Sox signed Moncada in 2015, as he was one of the top free agents available, but the infielder has struggled to live up to the hype.\n\nMoncada’s best season came in 2019 with the White Sox when he hit .315 with 25 home runs and 79 RBIs. But injuries have derailed his career as he hasn’t played over 100 games since 2022, when he played just 104. With the Angels last season, Moncada hit .234 with 12 home runs and 35 RBIs.\n\nIf the Pirates sign Moncada, he would join an infield that features Jared Triolo at third base, Nick Gonzalez at shortstop, newly-acquired Brandon Lowe at shortstop, and Spencer Horwitz at first base.\n\nMore Pirates: Aggressive Pirates Having Sensational Offseason Thus Far\n\nThe post Pirates Reportedly One Of Four Teams Interested In Intriguing Free Agent Infielder appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "Chaim Bloom has made it a priority this offseason to strengthen the team’s pitching staff and depth as a primary goal. After trading veteran starting pitcher Sonny Gray to the Boston Red Sox before Thanksgiving and returning MLB-ready Richard Fitts and minor league upside starter Brandon Clarke, as well as the recent trade of First Basemen Willson Contreras, also to Boston, for Hunter Dobbins, Yhoiker Fajardo, and Blake Aita the front office continues to pursue pitching through trades and free agency. Even if all of the arms acquired this offseason don’t reach the major leagues thats okay because young controllable pitching is the single most sought-after commodity, and the surplus can be used to acquire and upgrade other areas of the roster that may be lacking when the time comes to compete once more. Other names on the block include Brendan Donovan, JoJo Romero, Lars Nootbaar, and Nolan Arenado.\n\nAfter trading away Ryan Helsley, Phil Maton, and Steven Matz at the deadline, non-tendering John King, and all but expecting JoJo Romero to be pitching elsewhere in 2026. Chaim Bloom has publicly spoken about a desire to have a veteran presence in the bullpen to help the young relievers mature as everyday big leaguers. From the outside, they view their pitch to prospective free agents as pointing towards Andrew Kittredge and Phil Maton and point out that if you come to St. Louis for a year, you can re-establish yourself to earn a larger payday where there are innings and opportunity aplenty! If/when JoJo Romero is traded away, the team will only have fringe 40-man arm Nick Raquet from the left side on the 40-man roster. The Cardinals could consider multiple left-handed options if that indeed comes to fruition.\n\nChaim Bloom has staunchly been against promoting players before they are fully ready to move up, which is why I don’t view Quinn Matthews, Brycen Mautz, Pete Hansen, Ixan Henderson, Liam Doyle, etc., as options for the bullpen at the beginning of the 2026 season. Matthews is still trying to master AAA, and none of the other four have even competed in Triple-A, so they don’t know how their stuff will perform with a new variable added to their situation, like pitching with the big league ball.\n\nWhen trying to scope out who could be a potential target or fit, we can look for clues in the profile of arms the team has already acquired under the new leadership’s guided focus. Going back to this year’s draft selecting Liam Doyle and Tanner Franklin, the trade deadline in acquiring Nate Dohm and Frank Ellisalt, the trade for Richard Fitts and Brandon Clarke, or even their Rule 5 selection in Matt Pushard. High octane fastball’s appear to be the vogue guiding light for their player development group. Of course, I always bring names to the table. I would never leave you, the reader, without something to chew on or consider, so here are three names from the left side and the right side who bring one of a big fastball, veteran leadership/experience, or a combination of the two!\n\n2025 – 39 G 4.63 ERA 4.25 FIP 3.86 xFIP 32 K 35 IP\n\nBorucki will remind some fans of JoJo Romero as he throws his Slider 41% of the time as his primary pitch and produced a whiff% of 37.7. Overall, he had a .117/.229/.150 with a .188 wOBA against 70 LHB last season. His Sinker sits in the 93-94 range, which is plenty hard enough when batters are trying to decipher between that and an 85 MPH sweeping slider. The 10 MPH of separation between speeds works well to keep hitters off balance and produce some pretty ugly swings and misses. Borucki is probably one of the best available left-handers who offers the combination of stuff, performance, and experience left available on the open market.\n\n2025 – 19 G 8.31 ERA 5.77 FIP 5.18 xFIP 21 K 21.2 IP\n\nFor a pitcher with as much octane as Perez has, he strangely generates a whiff rate below 25%, which is just a little below league average. Perez IS however, a soft contact merchant. His Barrel rate of 2.9% and groundball rate of 60.9 % would both rank in the 99th percentile if he had a qualified number of innings pitched last season. The 16.4 BB% is the real kicker with Cionel, and I don’t know how you remedy that in my limited understanding of pitching mechanics, but perhaps the Cardinals would. Sitting at 95.6 MPH on average from his fastball, he certainly fits the “throws gas” north star the front office has established. .265/.390/.324 .331 wOBA against 43 LHB last season, you can clearly tell that the walks were what bit him. The .324 SLG is more than good enough if Perez can keep the ball in the zone. Busch will keep the ball in the park, and perhaps the Cardinals could catch lightning in a bottle as Perez would be a sought-after commodity with an additional year of club control accruing just over 4 years of service time so far at the deadline if the Cardinals can hone him in.\n\n2025 – 48 G 4.52 ERA 4.57 FIP 4.30 xFIP 53 K 67.2 IP\n\nI talked about Suter at the beginning of the offseason, and I believe his existence on the roster would still add a lot of value. Suter is a Harvard grad and can pitch multiple innings in relief; he can serve as an opener, and he would allow Manager Oli Marmol more flexibility with his bullpen usage. He’s one of the quickest workers in the big leagues, and that matters on 100-degree St. Louis days to keep players from baking in the sun. Suter would also fit PERFECTLY as the bullpen mentor as a reigning Clemente Award nominee. Those are all the “glue” reasons why Suter would fit. His under-the-hood metrics would make him almost the antithesis of our “North Star type.” But, while his average fastball velocity is in the 1st percentile at 87.9, his extension of 7.5 ft put him in the 99th percentile, which, as we know, increases perceived velocity and makes pitches appear to come out faster than they are because theyre being released so much closer than hitters are used to. His average exit velo against is 99th percentile at 85.8 mph, his BB% is low at 6.2%, his hard hit rate is 96th percentile at 32.9%, and he generates groundballs at a 45.4% clip. 18.2 K% is below average but not non-existent, as he’s a veteran who knows how to pitch and can get a strikeout when he needs one. There isn’t a whole lot of upside to be had in this profile, but when you value a Swiss Army knife type pitcher who can pitch in a variety of roles and situations thats valuable to a team with a young staff to help navigate and get through a full 162.\n\n2025 – 65 G 5.30 ERA 4.40 FIP 4.98 xFIP 58 K 56 IP\n\nImagine the flexibility that a roster that contained both Brent Suter and Ryne Stanek would provide! Stanek is a little bit like Cionel Perez in that his inability to throw strikes consistently in 2025 is what really hurt his overall numbers. Stanek can really step on the gas pedal with his average fastball velocity at 98.5 MPH, which had him in the 96th percentile. The 12.5 BB% doesn’t help things, and he’s a flyball pitcher – that CAN work, pitching your home games at Busch. Chaim had Stanek in Tampa Bay and knows just what he’s capable of, having experience pitching in a multitude of roles from opening to closing. Think of Ryan Helsley with Stanek. The fastball is hard but straight, but the slider is the true equalizer, generating an over 45% whiff rate! The numbers Stanek posted last season won’t get him big money this offseason, but he sure provides his next team a lot of tools to work with that could get the most out of him in 2026.\n\n2025 – 30 G 5.08 ERA 4.95 FIP 4.23 xFIP 28 K 33.2 IP\n\nIf you haven’t heard of Shawn Dubin that’s okay. Drafted in the 13th round of the 2018 draft, Dubin throws 6 unique pitches and could be similar to Kyle Leahy before Leahy broke out in 2025. Dubin limits hard contact, keeps the ball on the ground, but is below league average when it comes to strikeout stuff, generating swing and miss, and enticing batters to chase. Dubin is out of minor league options, so the flexibility is very limited, but he has 5 years of remaining control and could be signed to a minor league deal. If the Cardinals felt they could get a higher gear out of his stuff, then it’s possible they could find one of those late-blossoming gems to the already growing group of depth.\n\n2025 – 59 G 4.48 ERA 4.13 FIP 4.48 xFIP 58 K 60.1 IP\n\nRafael Montero will give Cardinals fans Carlos Martinez vibes for sure. Coming from a smaller stature and a whip-like arm motion, it’s very tsunami-esque, so is the erratic command at times. At 14.6 BB% in 2025, that part rings true. It’s 4 pitches that all have positive traits coming out of his hand, and his splitter was a +4 in run value last season to pair with a 95+ mph heater and an above-average breaking ball as well. Montero also has closing experience, with 30 saves credited to him from 2020-2023 as a closer by committee type situation in Houston before the arrival of Josh Hader. Command will always be the biggest question mark with Montero, but for the most part, the results are there, and the Cardinals could entice him with the potential to put him in late-game high-leverage/closing situations that could inevitably lead to a mid-season trade to a contender that would return more prospects to the Cardinals’ growing pipeline.\n\nAre any of these guys true difference makers in the grand scheme of things? Probably not. But the benefit of being in the situation the Cardinals are they can take swings on upside arms like Montero, Stanek, and Perez, but also benefit from veterans like Borucki and Suter, while also having the opportunity to give guys like Dubin a real shot at a big league roster spot. When doing some research on the free agent reliever market this weekend, these were the names remaining that stuck out to me the most, and the ones I think the Cardinals could buy low on and get really good value out of. Ultimately, what the team can accomplish on the trade market will tell the tale of what roster needs will remain heading into spring training, but be certain that more changes to the roster are coming – how soon is anyone’s guess at this point.",

    "description": "Despite a tough season, the Twins' farm system is booming with talent like Walker Jenkins and Emmanuel Rodriguez.",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Twins have quietly built one of baseball's strongest farm systems, and a recent MLB.com report confirms what scouts and analysts have been saying all year.\n\nDespite finishing the 2025 season with a disappointing 70-92 record and landing in fourth place in the American League Central, the Twins' future remains bright thanks to a talented collection of young players who could make a major impact in 2026 and beyond.\n\nMLB Pipeline's Sam Dykstra included the Twins among the organizations that took the biggest jumps in 2025, highlighting the development of several top prospects.\n\n\"Despite an early hamstring strain, 2023 fifth overall pick Walker Jenkins solidified his place as one of the game's best hitting prospects with his climb to Double-A Wichita, and he gives the Twins a\" strong foundation for the future, Dykstra wrote. \"At the time of our midseason farm system rankings, Minnesota boasted six Top 100 talents and placed second,\" he added, noting that while guys moving up will cause some movement in the rankings, there's no denying Jenkins' star power alongside the toolsy Emmanuel Rodriguez.\n\nHow soon will we see Emmanuel Rodriguez with the #MNTwins in 2026?\n\nSlashed .258/.429/.423 (.853 OPS) at just 22 years old in 52 games at Triple-A.\n\nAlso had an OPS over 1.000 in the Dominican Winter League. pic.twitter.com/9PIiMtDPYP\n\n— SleeperTwins (@SleeperMLBTwins) November 29, 2025\n\nThe Twins finished 18 games out of first place in 2025, but that rough season came with a silver lining as the organization held a trade deadline fire sale that brought back several promising prospects and helped restock an already impressive farm system.\n\nJenkins, who is currently ranked as the number three overall prospect in baseball by MLB Pipeline, showed why he's considered a future superstar by advancing all the way to Triple-A St. Paul at just 20 years old and making significant progress with his power development.\n\nThe five-tool outfielder hit .282/.394/.439 across 82 games in 2024 at multiple levels before working through the upper minors in 2025, and scouts believe he has the potential to be the top prospect in baseball heading into his big league debut.\n\nWalker Jenkins played a career-high 84 games this season and looked great. The 20-year-old slashed .286/.399/.451 with an .850 OPS and a 136 wRC+. His balanced offensive profile and ability to get his barrel in the zone on time allows for plenty of pull-side contact. pic.twitter.com/kj3aalA9Hy\n\n— Running From The OPS (@OPS_BASEBALL) November 29, 2025\n\nRodriguez, the Twins' number two prospect who ranks 32nd overall in MLB Pipeline's Top 100, also made waves by playing through injuries and showing elite plate discipline at Triple-A.\n\nAfter missing significant time with thumb issues, the 22-year-old Dominican outfielder crushed opposing pitching in the Dominican Winter League during the offseason, posting a .292/.417/.646 slash line with four home runs in just 18 games and earning MVP honors at an all-star game.\n\nBest Twins prospect per position:\n\nC: Eduardo Tait\n1B: Enrique Jimenez\n2B: Dameury Pena\nSS: Kaelen Culpepper 🎥\n3B: Andy Lugo\nLF: Gabriel Gonzalez\nCF: Emmanuel Rodriguez\nRF: Walker Jenkins\nDH: Hendry Mendez\n\nRHP: Riley Quick\nLHP: Kendry Rojas\n\nOF is elite 💎 pic.twitter.com/FQxEKnF9Mm\n\n— LouisAnalysis (@LouisAnalysis) December 22, 2025\n\nBoth Jenkins and Rodriguez could potentially make their Minnesota debuts sometime in 2026, with Jenkins likely arriving in the summer months and Rodriguez potentially cracking the Opening Day roster if he performs well in spring training.\n\nThe combination of Jenkins' all-around skill set and Rodriguez's power-patience approach gives the Twins two legitimate impact bats who could help turn around a franchise that has struggled to compete in recent years, and the additions made at the trade deadline have only strengthened a system that already ranked among baseball's best.",

    "title": "Atlanta Braves 2026 Draft Targets: Sawyer Strosnider",
    "description": "Sawyer Strosnider is an exciting sophomore outfielder who could tempt the Braves in the 2026 MLB Draft.",
    "fullText": "With the Atlanta Braves draft position being settled in as of last week, it is now time to start taking a look at some of the potential targets for the team in the 2026 MLB Draft. This series will take a look at 10 players who will have some chance to be available for the team with the ninth pick. We will be skipping over the four guys who as of right now have no shot at falling that far, the top three shortstops (Roch Cholowsky, Grady Emerson, Justin Lebron) and the top pitcher (Liam Peterson).\n\nWe will continue our series with the second of the big bats in the Braves tier, with exciting sophomore Sawyer Strosnider following AJ Gracia. This group of players is based on how things look ahead of the spring, as players could see their stock or even game change significantly over the next eight months.\n\nSawyer Strosnider is a sophomore outfielder at TCU who had a huge freshman season to get him into the conversation for the Top 10. He’s a 6’2’, 200-pound prospect that both bats and throws left-handed. In his freshman year he hit .350/.420/.650 with 13 doubles, 10 triples, 11 homers, and 10 steals in 14 chances. He also walked 20 times against 47 strikeouts in his 251 plate appearances.\n\nStrosnider is an exciting power and speed combo athlete. He brings both plus power and speed grades, which helped to translate into double digits in doubles, triples, homers, and steals as a true freshman last spring. His hit tool projects more as average as he is prone to chasing pitches and could do a better job at taking walks, but it did play very well last year. Defensively he has a real chance to stick in center with his plus speed and arm, though he will need to convert there as a pro after playing mostly right field in college in deference to another high end prospect. Either way he has the ability to be a strong defender at one of those positions.\n\nStrosnider could just be starting to tap into his potential. He is a former three-sport athlete in high school who was also a two-way prospect at one time as a pitcher, so there could be further gains for him as he continues to focus on hitting 100% of the time. He may even be the most exciting prospect in this draft, especially among the college prospects, as he is always a threat to do something in every phase of the game.\n\nIt’s worth noting that as of now we have covered six players in this series (Strosnider, Gracia, Tyler Spangler, Jacob Lombard, Eric Becker, and Tyler Bell). That means if the previously mentioned Top 3 and the top pitcher in the draft (Cholowsky, Emerson, Lebron, and Peterson) are all taken ahead of the Braves, they will have their choice of at least two of the guys we covered so far with the #9 selection – with four more profiles of prospects in this range yet to come.",

    "fullText": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow the various narrative paths.\n\n“Maybe I called it wrong, but it’s official.” — Tom Connolly, HoF Umpire.\n\nToday we feature financial skullduggery and other such fare, just the thing for a holiday week. Happy Birthday to Geoff Zahn* and other former Cubs.\n\n“… to all mankind, America’s wish for peace on Earth and goodwill to men everywhere.”\n\n1914 – Washington manager Clark Griffith meets with Walter Johnson in Kansas City and convinces the star to re-sign for $12,500, considerably less than his recent contract with the Chifeds, with the assurance that Griffith would convince the Washington management to spring for a bigger contract later. Washington will later sign Johnson to $16,000 a year for five years. Griffith gets $6,000 from Charles Comiskey to allow Johnson to repay his Chifed signing bonus. (2)\n\n1957 – In a continuing family squabble, Charles Comiskey, Jr. denies his sister, Mrs. Dorothy Comiskey Rigney’s, allegation that he used the “rule or ruin” tactic to gain control of the club. (2)\n\n1974 – The race to sign newly-minted free agent Catfish Hunter begins in the law offices of Cherry, Cherry & Flythe in Ahoskie, North Carolina. Yankee and Red Sox representatives are the first arrivals. (2)\n\n1986 – After finding no other clubs interested in signing him, free agent pitcher and 20-game winner Jack Morris agrees to salary arbitration with the Tigers while at the same time accusing the major league owners of collusion against free agents. Morris had offered to sign a one-year contract, with salary to be determined by an arbitrator, with either the Yankees, Angels, Twins or Phillies, but was turned down by all four. (1,2)\n\n1991 – Former minor league umpire Pam Postema files a sex discrimination suit against the National and American leagues, the Triple-A Alliance, and the Baseball Office for Umpire Development. (2)\n\n2001 – Free agent Moises Alou (.331, 27, 108) signs a $27 million, three-year deal with the Cubs. The former Astro All-Star’s presence in the Chicago line-up, along with Fred McGriff and Sammy Sosa, will give the team a fearsome 3-4-5 threesome. The Cubs also trade OF Michael Tucker to the Royals in exchange for a player to be named (who turned out to he minor leaguer Shawn Sonnier). (2)\n\nCubs Birthdays: Tony Taylor, Rob Gardner, Geoff Zahn*, Rafael Soriano, Taylor Gushue. Also notable: Al Kaline HOF.\n\n324 – Licinius abdicates his position as Roman Emperor.\n\n1154 – Henry II crowned King of England.\n\n1487 Opening ceremony of the sixth Great Temple of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City) 4,000 prisoners of war are sacrificed to Aztec gods over four days.\n\n1843 – ”A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens is published.\n\n1948 – National Football League Championship, Shibe Park, Philadelphia: Philadelphia Eagles shut out Chicago Cardinals, 7-0 in a snowstorm, ‘The Philly Blizzard.“\n\n1958 – First radio broadcast from space, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Christmas message “to all mankind, America’s wish for peace on Earth and goodwill to men everywhere.”\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nSome of these items spread from site to site without being fact-checked, and that is why we ask for verifiable sources, in order to help correct the record.",

    "description": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game.",
    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

    "description": "In the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.",
    "fullText": "Heather McPhee, associate general counsel for the NFL Players Association since 2009, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday, alleging that former executive director Lloyd Howell Jr. and two current top union executives conspired to prevent her from cooperating with a criminal investigation into union finances, as reported by ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr.\n\nMcPhee was placed on paid administrative leave on Aug. 14 after she was the subject of multiple employee complaints, per Van Natta and ESPN's Jeff Passan, that reportedly included accusations of failing to follow supervisors' directions, bullying colleagues and disrupting the union's work environment.\n\nIn the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.\n\nMonths before she was placed on leave, she made allegations that sparked an FBI investigation into the NFLPA, the MLBPA and OneTeam Partners, their $2 billion licensing company.\n\nMcPhee is reportedly seeking at least $10 million in damages, according to the suit, in which she accuses Howell of illegal misconduct, sex discrimination, breach of fiduciary duty and retaliation, per ESPN.\n\nHowell, who became the NFLPA's executive director in 2022, resigned on July 17. He stepped down after a tumultuous month of criticism that stemmed from Pablo Torre and Mike Florio reporting that the NFL and NFLPA covered up a ruling on a collusion grievance. An arbitrator, Christopher Droney, found that, in the wake of Deshaun Watson signing a fully-guaranteed $230 million contract with the Cleveland Browns ahead of the 2022 season, league executives encouraged team owners to reduce the amount of guaranteed money players received in subsequent contracts.\n\nDroney, though, concluded that he couldn't prove by a \"clear preponderance\" that NFL teams followed suit. Still, the details revealed from that 2022 annual owners' meeting were indelible, and so was the fact that the NFLPA reportedly agreed with the NFL to keep the collusion grievance findings under wraps. That left a stain on Howell's reputation, as did other matters, chief among them his reported spending of union funds for visits to strip clubs.\n\nAfter McPhee initially flagged concerns within the NFLPA in November 2024 regarding senior executives potentially violating labor laws governing conflicts of interest and the fulfillment of fiduciary duties, as reported by ESPN, she alleges that union leaders targeted her \"in order to conceal and deflect their own misconduct and failures.\"\n\nMcPhee questioned the legality of a senior executive incentive plan proposed by OneTeam Partners that would have paid millions of dollars in bonuses to Howell, MLBPA executive director Tony Clark and others, per ESPN, which also reported that McPhee states in the suit that she opposed Howell's decision to keep the collusion grievance findings secret.\n\nThe suit says, according to ESPN, that the union leaders signing a confidentiality agreement with the NFL \"raised concerns about a potential violation of the NFLPA's duty of fair representation to players.\"\n\nWhen union leaders discovered McPhee was in line to testify as a grand jury witness about what she deemed to be criminal misconduct by Howell and others, she alleges she was removed from meetings and cut off from the board and players.\n\nShe was then placed on leave due to her \"workplace behavior.\" McPhee believes that was a tactic to prevent her from cooperating with the DOJ.",

    "description": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing […]",
    "fullText": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing a notable free agent they have been linked to for a very team-friendly rate.\n\nThe Mets and Yankees had very different results in their 2025 MLB campaigns. While both clubs entered the year as serious World Series contenders and were two of the best teams in the league during the first half, the club from Queens shockingly collapsed in September and missed the playoffs. Although the Yanks got to the playoffs, they were ousted in the divisional round by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nAfter seasons that fell well below expectations, both clubs have been active this offseason as they look to improve their roster. Oddly enough, they are also in the market for the same positions. Each team is looking to bolster its rotation and is reportedly pursuing Michael King. They are also looking for new first basemen.\n\nTo the chagrin of Mets fans, the team lost home run king Pete Alonso in free agency to the Baltimore Orioles. While the Yankees are expected to move on from Paul Goldschmidt. Unsurprisingly, they have both been linked to Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami. A player whose market is reportedly weaker than he and his reps expected.\n\nRecent reports have suggested the corner infielder’s market has been weak as he closes in on the Dec. 22 deadline for him to sign with an MLB team. It has created some speculation that he might just end up returning to Japan if he doesn’t get the sort of offer he is looking for. However, Ken Rosenthal doesn’t buy into that discourse.\n\nIn a new report, he spoke about how Murakami’s swing and miss rate is believed to be the big reason why some teams are balking at giving the 25-year-old a big long-term contract. Rosenthal believes that the issue is overblown, and Shohei Ohtani had a higher rate before he made the move from Japan in 2018. The MLB insider firmly believes Murakami will be playing in the MLB next season.\n\nMunetaka Murakami stats: 69 G, .286 AVG, .392 OBP, .659 SLG, 1.051 OPS, 24 HR, 52 RBI, 40 R\n\nThat is very good news for the Mets and Yankees. Despite the questions about his defense and swing and miss rate, he is one of the greatest home run hitters in Japanese baseball history, and still hasn’t even hit his prime. With far fewer teams expected to be in on him, the pair of New York clubs could get a young player with huge upside at a far cheaper rate than they expected a month ago, or for fewer years.\n\nNew York Jets Player Requests Release From Team After 28-Point Loss\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "description": "Milwaukee second baseman has shown marked improvement at plate in his three MLB seasons. Hitting .300 might not be that much out of range for Turang.",
    "fullText": "In his three MLB seasons, Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Brice Turang has seen his batting average improve 40 points each season. He's continued to show marked improvement at the plate, which might lead some Brewers fans to consider this point.\n\nCould Turang hit .300 in the 2026 MLB season? Yes, he could.\n\nLook at Turang's power numbers. In 2023, Turang hit six home runs in 404 at-bats; in 2025, he hit seven home runs in 559 at-bats; and last season, Turang hit 18 home runs in 584 at-bats. As four doubles, Turang has gone from nine to 24 to 28 over his first three seasons.\n\nThis obviously shows that Turang is getting better and better each season.\n\nBrewers manager Pat Murphy might be smiling like a proud papa when he looks out at second base and sees Turang turning double plays with ease. \"He's a ballplayer,\" Murphy has said about Turang. \"You can see it. You can smell it. The best is yet to come for him. He's got so much to give.\"\n\nWhat's next for the Brewers' team MVP from 2025? He's going to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic next year. Turang has played for Team USA in teenage baseball series and remembers those times quite vividly.\n\n\"That was some of the best times that I’ve ever had playing baseball,\" Turang said, according to an MLB.com article. \"I was looking forward to seeing who the team was [for the 2026 tournament], and when I find out it’s me, I was like, 'Oh, man, I’m excited.'\"\n\nFor the Brewers, they want to make sure that they stay atop the National League Central Division again in 2026. They'd also like a return trip to the National League Championship Series and, potentially, knock off the Los Angeles Dodgers en route to their own World Series championship.\n\nTurang is quickly ensuring that he's a fan favorite, not only for his play on the field but how he handles himself as an MLB player.\n\nThe Brewers aren't going to bring a bunch of knuckleheads into the organization. Brewers president of baseball operations Matt Arnold is very selective on who he wants to bring on the team. And, yes, you better believe Murphy has a thing or two to say when new players are being considered for the ballclub.\n\nHe's worked hard to make sure the Brewers' clubhouse is strong and full of teammates that will stick up for one another.\n\nWatch for Turang to have a great 2026 and, hopefully, have a pleasant World Baseball Classic experience and avoid getting injured.\n\nRemember to join our BREWERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE! You can post your own thoughts, in text or video form, and you can engage with our Roundtable staff, as well as other Brewers fans. If prompted to download the Roundtable APP, that's free too.",

    "fullText": "MLB free agency 2025-26 hasn’t been quite as active as everyone hoped, with many of the top MLB free agents still available as Christmas Day nears. There’s still plenty of time for big signings to happen, meaning teams that have fallen short of expectations in the open market could still turn things around.\n\nMore than a month into MLB free agency, we’re highlighting some of the winners and losers so far.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays responded to a heartbreaking loss in Game 7 of the World Series by splurging early in MLB free agency. Dylan Cease got a hefty contract, but Toronto is rightfully betting on a co-ace who finished in the 95th percentile for Whiff rate last season and in the 89th percentile for strikeout rate. To support the back of the rotation, the club brought in Cody Ponce after he turned his career around overseas. Most recently, the Blue Jays bullpen got better with the addition of Tyler Rogers (2.38 ERA over 147.2 IP in last two seasons). Best of all, there’s still a very real chance of Bo Bichette being re-signed and a potential Kyle Tucker signing.\n\nBuster Posey isn’t at fault for what’s happening with the San Francisco Giants right now. The problem is ownership. It started in March when a 10% stake in the franchise was sold to the private equity firm Sixth Street. Things don’t get better when private equity is brought in; reducing costs to increase revenue is the goal. Suddenly this offseason, the Giants reportedly aren’t interested in spending $100 million-plus on a starting pitcher. Sixth Street might not like to hear this, but that’s the going rate for quality starters in the open market. There’s no reason to expect San Francisco to start splurging later this winter.\n\nThe back-to-back World Series champions had a glaring need to address this offseason, and they took care of it quickly. Over the last three seasons, the All-Star closer ranks 11th among qualified relievers in ERA (2.48), sixth in batting average allowed ($0.173$) and third in strikeout rate (38.4%). Los Angeles needed a shutdown closer; Diaz provides it. Equally as valuable to Los Angeles, Diaz took a short-term deal (three years, $69 million) so the Dodgers are still positioning themselves for long-term flexibility if a salary cap is implemented.\n\nWe could give credit to the Pittsburgh Pirates for being aggressive early in MLB free agency and making a genuine effort to sign Kyle Schwarber. Here’s the problem: Pittsburgh is striking out on all the top MLB free agents. Why? Because Pirates owner Bob Nutting has put this franchise in such a disastrous and poorly-run state that top talent wants nothing to do with the club. So, with an MLB salary floor likely incoming, Pittsburgh will have to vastly overspend on mid-tier free agents and overpay for marginal talent just to meet the cap floor. This is what happens when an owner spends years fielding an awful team and investing as little as he can into the on-field product.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles are finally spending serious money in MLB free agency. Yes, the Pete Alonso contract (five years, $155 million) is a significant commitment to a 31-year-old who can barely play first base. However, it was also a desperately needed addition since the Orioles lineup finished 19th in slugging and 21st in OPS last season. Plus, this signing positions Baltimore to flip either Ryan Mountcastle or Coby Mayo for a starting pitcher. We’ve been waiting years for the Orioles to spend, and they finally did it; credit is due.\n\nIn the span of just a few weeks, the New York Mets moved on from Brandon Nimmo, Pete Alonso and Edwin Diaz. We can justify in some regard the decision to not re-sign Alonso, but giving Jorge Polanco $20 million per year is a massive risk given his knee issues. New York certainly improved defensively by bringing in Marcus Semien, but he’s coming off a two-year stretch at the plate with a .234/.307/.379 triple-slash line and a .686 OPS. So, if his fielding dips considerably in his age 35 season, he’s a complete negative for New York. Oh, we’re also still waiting on the Mets rotation to be addressed.",

    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith seemingly forgot the 2020 MLB season was shortened due to Covid-19 when he claimed New York Mets star Pete Alonso was injured and barely played.\n\nOn Wednesday, ESPN’s Jeff Passan announced that Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal to join the Baltimore Orioles. Alonso, 31, played his first seven seasons in the MLB with the Mets and was considered one of the faces of the franchise.\n\nBREAKING: First baseman Pete Alonso and the Baltimore Orioles are finalizing a five-year, $155 million contract, sources tell ESPN. Alonso leaves the Mets to make a loaded AL East even better.\n\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 10, 2025\n\nHours later, Smith reacted to the news on The Stephen A. Smith Show. First, he lambasted the Mets for allowing star closer Edwin Diaz to sign with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers. He applied that same criticism to Alonso’s departure.\n\nWhile talking about Alonso’s stats, however, Smith appeared to overlook a vitally important piece of context:\n\nHe’s been in the league about seven years. Let’s look at him, alright? He got injured in year two. So, he hits 53 home runs and 120 RBIs his first year in 2019. Next year, he gets hurt, only played in 57 games. Still smacks 16 home runs, 35 RBIs. Next year, 37 home runs, 94 RBIs. The year after that, 2022, 40 home runs, 131 RBIs.\n\nTo Smith’s credit, he quickly realized his mistake with the 2020 season. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the MLB regular season was only 60 games. With 57 games played, Alonso appeared in nearly every game of that shortened season.\n\n“Actually, 2020 was Covid,” Smith clarified. “I apologize. You gotta remember that, because there was a truncated season because all the stuff that was going on in Covid.”\n\nUnfortunately for Smith, the damage was already done and social media users rushed to roast him for the error.\n\nStephen A Smith said Pete Alonso \"got hurt and only played in 57 games his 2nd season\", when really it was the 60 game shortened COVID season\n\n— Fuzzy (@fuzzyfromyt) December 11, 2025\n\nSAS and @ColinCowherd have made a fortune talking about sports despite knowing nothing about sports. It's legit impressive. https://t.co/sdFldE7oIR\n\n— Funhouse (@BackAftaThis) December 12, 2025\n\nHas anyone ever brought up the fact that these guys are simply on TV so often that it’s actually not shocking at all that they don’t follow sports? https://t.co/ZpAeKvuRDl\n\n— Tim Kalinowski (@TimmyKal12) December 12, 2025\n\nHighest paid sports \"commentator\" in the business btw https://t.co/fN2CvjZbgj\n\n— Dean Kremer Enjoyer (@DK_Enj) December 11, 2025\n\nThis clown is the highest paid employee at ESPN https://t.co/JgIjYkf17t\n\n— cg (@colingreten) December 12, 2025\n\nAnd to think Stephen A. Smith gets paid over $100 million to spew nonsense like this day in and day out, with no pushback from anyone with real power.

    "fullText": "The 2025 MLB winter meetings are over, and there were plenty of big takeaways with some of the biggest names off the board in a few days.\n\nThe Ketel Marte trade rumors swirled. The New York Mets saw Edwin Diaz leave for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Pete Alonso sign a big contract with the Baltimore Orioles (which left Mets fans NOT OK). Kyle Schwarber is still a member of the Philadelphia Phillies. Whew! That's a lot of news!\n\nBut there are still some big names left to be signed. So we're rounding them up for you in order of talent. Let's go:\n\nThe jewel of the offseason didn't sign anywhere. Whoever signing him should be prepared to dole out A LOT of money for a player who can do it all.\n\nHe was positively raking before a knee injury prematurely ended his regular season. Anyone looking for a shortstop who can drive in runs would love to sign him.\n\nHe's 32 and spent some time on the injured list this season. But he's still a top infield option for contenders.\n\nWere his numbers inflated thanks to Yankee Stadium? We'll see if that's true, if he signs elsewhere.\n\nThe pitcher who went from bullpen stud to solid starter should get paid.\n\nHe's probably a middle-of-the-rotation guy, but a VERY valuable one if he keeps this up.\n\nHis rough end of season may be a factor, but he's still a top-end starting pitcher still in his prime. That's worth a lot.\n\nThe Japanese slugger has been posted by his team, the Yakult Swallows, and he could be a sneaky good addition.\n\nHe's getting up there in age (34) but he can still hit dingers.\n\nAnother Japanese name who could end up being worth the investment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: MLB rumors: Best remaining free agents after 2025 winter meetings",

    "fullText": "Mets slammed as “doomed” by former MLB execs after Alonso news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt took less than a day for the mood of New York Mets’ observers to hit rock bottom. After losing All-Star closer Edwin Diaz to the Los Angeles Dodgers, former MLB general managers Jim Duquette, Jim Bowden and Steve Phillips spent the morning on MLB Network Radio suggesting the New York Mets should be “panicked.” Hours later, it was reported that Pete Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles, and the same group reportedly shifted their tone to “doomed.”\n\nSNY broadcaster and former Met Ron Darling on MLB Network’s MLB Tonight said he was “flabbergasted.”\n\nAlonso’s departure is not only a big blow to the Mets’ offseason plans, but it ends a franchise era.\n\nAlonso, who turned 31 Sunday,  hit .272 with 38 home runs, 126 RBI and an .871 OPS over 162 games last season. He finishes his Mets tenure with 264 career home runs, the most in franchise history, along with 712 RBI and a .253 career batting average.\n\nThat’s elite middle-of-the-order production vanishing overnight.\n\nNew York also missed on a potential left-handed power fit when Kyle Schwarber re-signed with Philadelphia.  Brandon Nimmo’s departure via trade to the Texas Rangers for Marcus Semien creates even more questions for the Mets.\n\nEven at closer, the Mets are asked to trust Devin Williams, a new arrival and high-pressure answer after Diaz left for Los Angeles on a three-year, $69 million deal. Mets GM David Stearns said they think that Williams’ career-worst year against the Mets in 2025 was because he was “unlucky.”\n\nWith the biggest names gone, Stearns must get creative. Options remain, but none come without risk — and none replace Alonso’s presence by themselves.\n\nHere are the most realistic paths still on the board:\n\nCody Bellinger\nA lefty bat with defensive flexibility in the outfield and at first base. Once an MVP-caliber slugger, he hit .272 with 29 homers last season.\n\nOne of the few impact bats left on the market after 2025: last season he hit .266 with 22 home runs, 73 RBI, 91 runs scored, and compiled an .841 OPS in 136 games.\n\nAlex Bregman\nA high-floor infielder who could stabilize the batting order, but doesn’t replace pure first-base power. He’s one of the bigger bats still available.\n\nBo Bichette\nMore contact hitter than slugger, but an impact offensive piece who could reshape the overall lineup profile.\n\nThose names provide lineup value, but the Mets lost production and popular players.\n\nAlsono was not only a durable first baseman who has led the MLB in home runs since his debut. Diaz was a closer who electrified Citi Field with his entrances and dominated in high leverage.  Fans identified with them, and their teammates reportedly embraced them.\n\nThe former GMs on MLB Network Radio have seen enough offseasons to know when desperation is creeping in. Two franchise pillars are gone. The division remains brutal. And the fan base just watched its most iconic slugger pack for Baltimore.\n\nDarling was blunt in his assessment, too.\n\n\"This is a real loss for the New York Mets,\" Darling said.\n\nIf the Mets don’t respond aggressively and fast, this winter may be remembered not as a turning point but as a full-scale collapse.",

    "fullText": "Tarik Skubal is the talk of the MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando. The Detroit Tigers have a decision to make as Skubal enters free agency after the 2026 season. There have been rumors suggesting the Los Angeles Dodgers could be closing in on a trade for Skubal; however, those rumors have been shut down.\n\nThe “Skubal to Dodgers” rumors at the Winter Meetings are all smoke and “not real,” as reported by FanSided’s Robert Murray on The Baseball Insiders. As of now, it doesn’t appear that Skubal will be traded from Detroit, but if an offer blows away the organization, it could entice them to pull the trigger.\n\nThe Tigers want to keep Skubal and pursue a trip to the 2026 World Series, but more needs to be done. If Detroit keeps the back-to-back AL Cy Young Award winner, it needs to make moves to maximize the 2026 season. If not, the Tigers would be better off trading Skubal to maximize his value.\n\nSkubal would demand a very, very big trade package, and unless a team is willing to meet Detroit’s demands, it doesn’t seem likely to happen this winter. The Tigers need to pick a lane on Skubal, but for now, the rumors of a trade to the Dodgers don’t seem to have any legs.\n\nBaltimore Orioles sign Pete Alonso to massive five-year contract\n\nBaltimore Orioles discussing historic trade with Washington in 2025\n\nLatest MLB Rumors on Braves Caution, Reds-Marte, Mets-Alonso, Blue Jays Trade",

    "fullText": "MLB Winter Meetings tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWinter Meetings latest news and rumors\n\nFree agent signings and trades by team\n\nThe MLB offseason can move at a painfully slow pace, but if history is any indication, December will be the busiest month, thanks in part to the Winter Meetings.\n\nThe annual congregation of executives, managers and free agents and, of course, agents takes place in Orlando this year, and there is plenty of business to get done.\n\nA fairly impressive crop of free agents is mostly unsigned, though there are some exceptions. Dylan Cease already landed with the Toronto Blue Jays on a seven-year, $210 million deal, while Josh Naylor and Devin Williams are among other names who have earned new deals in the weeks leading up to the Winter Meetings.\n\nThe trade market could be worth watching more closely than the free-agent market as the Winter Meetings play out. While a Tarik Skubal trade doesn't seem imminent or even particularly likely this offseason, Ketel Marte, MacKenzie Gore and Jarren Duran are among the names who have surfaced in rumors.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking all of the latest buzz below, from rumors to signings and trades. Follow along with the latest updates below.\n\nMORE:Ranking the top MLB free agents\n\nThe Red Sox are seen as strong candidates for Ketel Marte compared to the Blue Jays because of their young starting pitching depth, Jon Morosi reports. The Diamondbacks have been known to be targeting young starters in any Marte talks.\n\nThe Tigers have agreed to a two-year, $19 million deal to bring back reliever Kyle Finnegan. Acquired from the Nationals at the July deadline, Finnegan impressed with a 1.50 ERA and 11.5 K/9 rate in 16 appearances with the Tigers, putting himself in line for save opportunities in 2026.\n\nThe Orioles and Nationals have had \"steady communication\" about SP MacKenzie Gore, whose name has been floated in trade rumors since the July deadline, Jon Morosi reports.\n\nTampa Bay's Brandon Lowe is among the names surfacing in trade talks for second basemen, and the chances of a deal this week are \"increasing,\" Jon Morosi reports.\n\nThe market for Diamondbacks 2B Ketel Marte is \"heating up,\" Jon Heyman reports, with the Red Sox, Mariners, Blue Jays, Phillies and Rays all believed to be in the mix for the All-Star.\n\nThe Red Sox have discussed a Corey Seager trade with the Rangers, the Boston Globe reports, though WEEI's Rob Bradford says the talks don't have momentum at the moment. Seager has been a superstar with the Rangers when healthy, but Texas is on a mission to shed salary this winter and the two-time World Series MVP still has six years remaining on his massive contract.\n\nThe Marlins are \"engaged\" in trade talks involving SP Edward Cabrera with numerous teams, Jon Heyman reports. Cabrera enjoyed a breakout season for Miami in 2025 and was a popular name leading up to the July deadline.\n\nThe Pirates have agreed to a one-year, $7.75 million deal with reliever Gregory Soto, who posted a 4.18 ERA and 3.42 FIP between the Orioles and Mets in 2025.\n\nThe Cubs met with the star infielder over Zoom \"a few weeks ago,\" per Robert Murray.\n\nWith Kyle Schwarber off the market, and Baltimore being one potential landing spot for him, Morosi reports that the Orioles have spoken with the camp of Kyle Tucker.\n\nBefore Kyle Schwarber agreed to re-sign with the Phillies, Baltimore matched Philadelphia's offer of five years, $150 million, per Rosenthal. The Reds offered Schwarber a five-year deal \"in the $125 million range,\" while the Pirates offered four years and $120 million.\n\nPer Jon Morosi, within the AL East, the Red Sox are viewed as a stronger trade candidate for star infielder Ketel Marte than the Blue Jays, because of Boston's depth of MLB-ready starters.\n\nSpeaking at the Winter Meetings, agent Scott Boras said he expects 1B Pete Alonso's market to pick up now that Kyle Schwarber has signed. Alonso has reportedly been in and out of the meetings to meet with teams, including the Red Sox and Orioles.\n\nThe Tigers have been floated as a potential Alex Bregman suitor, but they also have real interest in SS Ha-Seong Kim, according to the Detroit Free Press. Kim, a terrific defender, landed with the Rays last offseason but missed most of 2025 and finished the year with the Braves. After a healthy September, Kim opted out of his deal.\n\nThe Mets \"may be hesitant to go more than three years\" on a new deal for 1B Pete Alonso, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reports, which could complicate the path to a reunion between the two sides. Alonso settled for a short deal last winter but is looking for long-term security this time around after a strong season at the plate.\n\nThe Angels are acquiring infielder Vaughn Grissom from the Red Sox, in exchange for OF prospect Isaiah Jackson. Grissom, Boston's one-for-one return for Chris Sale two years ago, struggled in a brief MLB stint in 2024 and spent all of 2025 in the minor leagues, posting a .783 OPS. 2026 will be Grissom's age-25 season.\n\nThe Padres and GM A.J. Preller are \"shooting big\" in trade talks and working on \"multiple fronts\" to put together significant deals, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports.\n\nWith the Mets' former closer, Edwin Diaz, off the market, New York is now viewed as a suitor for the new top available reliever, Robert Suarez. The Blue Jays are also in the mix, per Jon Morosi.\n\nFormer Mets closer Edwin Diaz has agreed to a deal with the Dodgers, according to The Athletic's Will Sammon, bolstering a bullpen that was a rare weakness for much of the regular season in 2025.\n\nDiaz's deal is worth $69 million over three years, per Jeff Passan.\n\nThe Phillies have agreed to a five-year, $150 million deal to re-sign DH Kyle Schwarber, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. Schwarber, who was the runner-up for NL MVP in 2025, was also pursued by the Reds, Pirates, Orioles and Mets.\n\nWhile the Red Sox are taking a look at a bevy of infielders, including Pete Alonso, Bo Bichette and Ketel Marte, a reunion with Alex Bregman remains Boston's \"No. 1 target,\" according to The Athletic. A trade for Isaac Paredes could be a fallback option if a deal can't be reached with Bregman.\n\nHarris answered a question about Tarik Skubal's trade status, as the executive said he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't listen. Skubal has one year left on his contract, which could prompt Detroit to trade him before the season begins if the team gets a good deal.\n\nMatz is a former starter who transitioned to the bullpen last season, and found success with the Red Sox late in the year, finishing the season with a 3.05 ERA between St. Louis and Boston. Topkin adds that the deal will span two years.\n\nMegill was the best relievers on the Brewers last year, but Milwaukee is always exploring different ways to mix up its team. The Yankees have a reliever vacancy after losing Devin Williams to the Mets in free agency, but the Mets also still need to upgrade their bullpen.\n\nAccording to Rome, no deal is close, but Houston's interest in Baz is real and could be the type of move that the team prefers. Baz is coming off a season where he made a career-high 31 starts for the Rays, but still pitched to a 4.87 ERA.\n\nGore is one of several pitchers who could be traded, as the Nats look to build for the future. While Golden also reports the Red Sox and Padres explored a Gore trade at the trade deadline, he specifically names the Yankees as a team that has made a call in recent days.\n\nSuarez is one of the top relievers on the market, and the Mets, Blue Jays and Dodgers are all teams that have shown interest in improving their bullpens. Those three teams have also been linked to top closer Edwin Diaz, which makes Suarez a potential fallback option.\n\nCotillo added that other teams may be waiting for Schwarber to sign before moving on to other players. While the Phillies are believed to be the favorite to retain the DH, but the Red Sox, Mets, Reds and Pirates have all been linked to Schwarber as well.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are willing to listen on 2B Ketel Marte and are emphasizing MLB-ready starting pitchers in talks, but their asking price remains high, according to Jon Morosi. Marte has been one of the hottest names as the Winter Meetings get underway, indicating teams believe he can be had in a trade, and interested teams  reportedly include the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Mariners.\n\nThe Orioles are in on free agent starter Ranger Suarez, Jon Heyman reports. Suarez is one of the top free agent arms available, and Baltimore has been connected to starters since the offseason began.\n\nFree agent 1B Pete Alonso is heading to the Winter Meetings to meet with interested suitors, including the Red Sox and Orioles, according to the New York Post. Alonso lives a short drive away from Orlando, so he will meet in-person with interested teams.\n\nYankees GM Brian Cashman said at the Winter Meetings that the organization is \"open-minded\" but doesn't have to do as much as last winter because of the talent on the roster. \"We have really good players on this roster, and we are covered in most all areas that you need to be covered.\"\n\nThe Nationals are receiving heavy interest in SS CJ Abrams in trade talks and are open to dealing him, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon report. Washington is also talking about deals centered on SP MacKenzie Gore as the new front office looks to shake up the organization.\n\nThe Blue Jays are also among teams talking to the Diamondbacks about 2B Ketel Marte, Jon Heyman reports. The Red Sox and Mariners were reported Sunday as potential suitors for Marte, though there doesn't appear to be much traction in talks yet, Heyman reports.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have agreed to a one-year, $7.5 million deal with pitcher Michael Soroka. Soroka split the 2025 season with the Nationals and Cubs, posting a 4.87 ERA and 4.16 FIP over 16 starts with Washington before an injury limited him to 8.1 strong innings with Chicago. Soroka could function as either a starter or reliever in Arizona.\n\nDiamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte is in high demand this offseason, as a number of suitors have pursued the All-Star infielder. The Red Sox, Mariners, Pirates, Rays, Tigers and Jays are all listed as targets by New York Post's Jon Heyman.\n\nOne of the top arms available on the market, Valdez has been travelling from coast to coast, as it's reported he's visited Baltimore, New York and San Francisco. The 32-year-old lefty finished his eighth season in Houston last year with a .366 ERA.\n\nThe Pirates said they were looking to spend this offseason around Paul Skenes. How about Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber? Pittsburgh has reportedly put a four-year offer in for the free agent, while Red Sox, Cubs, Reds and others remain in the mix.\n\nThe Mariners have acquire reliever Jose Ferrer from the Nationals, in exchange for catching prospect Harry Ford and pitching prospect Isaac Lyon. The 25-year-old Ferrer has unspectacular raw numbers as a major-leaguer, but a career 3.33 FIP, impressive walk rate and high velocity make him a potential high-leverage reliever for Seattle, while Ford is a consensus top-75 prospect in baseball and could be the Nationals' catcher of the future.\n\nDespite July's firesale, the Minnesota Twins are not planning to trade Joe Ryan, Byron Buxton or Pablo Lopez this winter, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports. The Twins discussed a Ryan trade with the Boston Red Sox at the deadline but decided against dealing their young ace.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers remain \"engaged\" with teams on a potential Tarik Skubal trade, according to ESPN's Buster Olney, but they are still unsure about dealing him and have an \"enormous\" asking price. Skubal, the back-to-back reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, is set to be a free agent after the 2026 season and is reportedly far apart in extension talks with the Tigers.\n\nP Ryan Yarbrough (re-signed, 1yr/$2.5M)\n\nP Drew Anderson (1yr/$7M with $10M option for 2027)\n\nRP Kyle Finnegan (re-signed, 2yr/$19M)\n\n1B Josh Naylor (re-signed, 5yr/$92.5M)\n\nDH Kyle Schwarber (re-signed, 5yr/$150M)\n\nCL Emilio Pagan (re-signed, 2yr/$20M)\n\nC James McCann (re-signed, 1yr/$2.75M)\n\nINF Miguel Rojas (re-signed, 1yr/$5.5M)\n\nHere are the remaining free agents from SN's ranking of the top 27 free agents this winter:\n\nJapanese standouts Tatsuya Imai and Kazuma Okamoto were also posted and are available to MLB teams, making for one of the strongest-ever free agent crops of Japanese talent in one offseason.",

    "fullText": "The Mets lost closer Edwin Díaz to the reigning champions Dodgers, with the reliever agreeing to a three year, $69 million contract with Los Angeles and setting a new AAV record for relievers.\n\nThe Mets’ offer to Díaz was for three years and $66 million with some deferrals, though they expressed a willingness to improve the number.\n\nA few factors impacted the Mets’ ability to retain Díaz outside of the pure dollar amount at play.\n\nThe Dodgers’ deal with Díaz also includes some deferrals, about $4.5 million deferred per year.\n\nAnthony DiComo rounded up all the important bits of the Díaz signing and the fallout for the Mets.\n\nDevin Williams was surprised that Díaz did not return, and he expressed excitement at the opportunity to earn the closer role.\n\nDíaz wasn’t the only reliever the Mets lost, as Gregory Soto signed with the Pirates on a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nThe Mets also made an offer to Kyle Schwarber before he re-signed with Philadelphia, offering around three years and $120 million for the free agent slugger.\n\nStar free agent Pete Alonso will now take up more of the spotlight with Schwarber off the board.\n\nThe Mets are reportedly reluctant to go past three years with Alonso.\n\nAnd while the Mets remain interested in a reunion with Alonso, other options exist and remain in play for the team.\n\nDespite the blows taken by the Mets, David Stearns is still optimistic about the team’s offseason.\n\nStearns still understands why Mets fans are feeling frustrated, especially in the wake of how 2025 ended.\n\nJohn Harper wrote about whether Stearns has a plan fans should trust and what things might be other valuable parts of contract decisions other than pure player value.\n\nThe Mets are willing to listen to trade offers for All-Star starter David Peterson, though the price will be considerable.\n\nThe draft lottery was held yesterday, and because the Mets landed outside of the protected top ten picks, the Mets’ pick was docked ten spots and will be 27th overall.\n\nThe Mets and Starling Marte reportedly have mutual interest in a reunion.\n\nHaving spent years with the Mets, Tommy Tanous has been hired by the Rockies as an assistant general manager.\n\nMLB.com looked at the fallout in the wake of the Díaz and Schwarber signings, including where the Mets go from here.\n\nKyle Schwarber returned to the Phillies, agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract.\n\nHis contract is an anomaly in baseball, but Jayson Stark explained why it fits such an unique player.\n\nLeft hander Alec Gamboa and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league split contract with an invite to spring training.\n\nThe Red Sox also traded infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox landed the number one pick in the 2026 draft.\n\nAfter being traded to Detroit last season, Kyle Finnegan re-signed with the Tigers on a two-year contract worth $19 million.\n\nA Pod of Their Own was back with another episode.\n\nDecember 10th is a very busy trade day in Mets history, with three major trades taking place on this date.",
