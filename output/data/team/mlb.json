    "fullText": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow the various narrative paths.\n\n“Maybe I called it wrong, but it’s official.” — Tom Connolly, HoF Umpire.\n\nToday we feature financial skullduggery and other such fare, just the thing for a holiday week. Happy Birthday to Geoff Zahn* and other former Cubs.\n\n“… to all mankind, America’s wish for peace on Earth and goodwill to men everywhere.”\n\n1914 – Washington manager Clark Griffith meets with Walter Johnson in Kansas City and convinces the star to re-sign for $12,500, considerably less than his recent contract with the Chifeds, with the assurance that Griffith would convince the Washington management to spring for a bigger contract later. Washington will later sign Johnson to $16,000 a year for five years. Griffith gets $6,000 from Charles Comiskey to allow Johnson to repay his Chifed signing bonus. (2)\n\n1957 – In a continuing family squabble, Charles Comiskey, Jr. denies his sister, Mrs. Dorothy Comiskey Rigney’s, allegation that he used the “rule or ruin” tactic to gain control of the club. (2)\n\n1974 – The race to sign newly-minted free agent Catfish Hunter begins in the law offices of Cherry, Cherry & Flythe in Ahoskie, North Carolina. Yankee and Red Sox representatives are the first arrivals. (2)\n\n1986 – After finding no other clubs interested in signing him, free agent pitcher and 20-game winner Jack Morris agrees to salary arbitration with the Tigers while at the same time accusing the major league owners of collusion against free agents. Morris had offered to sign a one-year contract, with salary to be determined by an arbitrator, with either the Yankees, Angels, Twins or Phillies, but was turned down by all four. (1,2)\n\n1991 – Former minor league umpire Pam Postema files a sex discrimination suit against the National and American leagues, the Triple-A Alliance, and the Baseball Office for Umpire Development. (2)\n\n2001 – Free agent Moises Alou (.331, 27, 108) signs a $27 million, three-year deal with the Cubs. The former Astro All-Star’s presence in the Chicago line-up, along with Fred McGriff and Sammy Sosa, will give the team a fearsome 3-4-5 threesome. The Cubs also trade OF Michael Tucker to the Royals in exchange for a player to be named (who turned out to he minor leaguer Shawn Sonnier). (2)\n\nCubs Birthdays: Tony Taylor, Rob Gardner, Geoff Zahn*, Rafael Soriano, Taylor Gushue. Also notable: Al Kaline HOF.\n\n324 – Licinius abdicates his position as Roman Emperor.\n\n1154 – Henry II crowned King of England.\n\n1487 Opening ceremony of the sixth Great Temple of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City) 4,000 prisoners of war are sacrificed to Aztec gods over four days.\n\n1843 – ”A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens is published.\n\n1948 – National Football League Championship, Shibe Park, Philadelphia: Philadelphia Eagles shut out Chicago Cardinals, 7-0 in a snowstorm, ‘The Philly Blizzard.“\n\n1958 – First radio broadcast from space, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Christmas message “to all mankind, America’s wish for peace on Earth and goodwill to men everywhere.”\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nSome of these items spread from site to site without being fact-checked, and that is why we ask for verifiable sources, in order to help correct the record.",

    "description": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game.",
    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

    "description": "In the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.",
    "fullText": "Heather McPhee, associate general counsel for the NFL Players Association since 2009, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday, alleging that former executive director Lloyd Howell Jr. and two current top union executives conspired to prevent her from cooperating with a criminal investigation into union finances, as reported by ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr.\n\nMcPhee was placed on paid administrative leave on Aug. 14 after she was the subject of multiple employee complaints, per Van Natta and ESPN's Jeff Passan, that reportedly included accusations of failing to follow supervisors' directions, bullying colleagues and disrupting the union's work environment.\n\nIn the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.\n\nMonths before she was placed on leave, she made allegations that sparked an FBI investigation into the NFLPA, the MLBPA and OneTeam Partners, their $2 billion licensing company.\n\nMcPhee is reportedly seeking at least $10 million in damages, according to the suit, in which she accuses Howell of illegal misconduct, sex discrimination, breach of fiduciary duty and retaliation, per ESPN.\n\nHowell, who became the NFLPA's executive director in 2022, resigned on July 17. He stepped down after a tumultuous month of criticism that stemmed from Pablo Torre and Mike Florio reporting that the NFL and NFLPA covered up a ruling on a collusion grievance. An arbitrator, Christopher Droney, found that, in the wake of Deshaun Watson signing a fully-guaranteed $230 million contract with the Cleveland Browns ahead of the 2022 season, league executives encouraged team owners to reduce the amount of guaranteed money players received in subsequent contracts.\n\nDroney, though, concluded that he couldn't prove by a \"clear preponderance\" that NFL teams followed suit. Still, the details revealed from that 2022 annual owners' meeting were indelible, and so was the fact that the NFLPA reportedly agreed with the NFL to keep the collusion grievance findings under wraps. That left a stain on Howell's reputation, as did other matters, chief among them his reported spending of union funds for visits to strip clubs.\n\nAfter McPhee initially flagged concerns within the NFLPA in November 2024 regarding senior executives potentially violating labor laws governing conflicts of interest and the fulfillment of fiduciary duties, as reported by ESPN, she alleges that union leaders targeted her \"in order to conceal and deflect their own misconduct and failures.\"\n\nMcPhee questioned the legality of a senior executive incentive plan proposed by OneTeam Partners that would have paid millions of dollars in bonuses to Howell, MLBPA executive director Tony Clark and others, per ESPN, which also reported that McPhee states in the suit that she opposed Howell's decision to keep the collusion grievance findings secret.\n\nThe suit says, according to ESPN, that the union leaders signing a confidentiality agreement with the NFL \"raised concerns about a potential violation of the NFLPA's duty of fair representation to players.\"\n\nWhen union leaders discovered McPhee was in line to testify as a grand jury witness about what she deemed to be criminal misconduct by Howell and others, she alleges she was removed from meetings and cut off from the board and players.\n\nShe was then placed on leave due to her \"workplace behavior.\" McPhee believes that was a tactic to prevent her from cooperating with the DOJ.",

    "description": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing […]",
    "fullText": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing a notable free agent they have been linked to for a very team-friendly rate.\n\nThe Mets and Yankees had very different results in their 2025 MLB campaigns. While both clubs entered the year as serious World Series contenders and were two of the best teams in the league during the first half, the club from Queens shockingly collapsed in September and missed the playoffs. Although the Yanks got to the playoffs, they were ousted in the divisional round by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nAfter seasons that fell well below expectations, both clubs have been active this offseason as they look to improve their roster. Oddly enough, they are also in the market for the same positions. Each team is looking to bolster its rotation and is reportedly pursuing Michael King. They are also looking for new first basemen.\n\nTo the chagrin of Mets fans, the team lost home run king Pete Alonso in free agency to the Baltimore Orioles. While the Yankees are expected to move on from Paul Goldschmidt. Unsurprisingly, they have both been linked to Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami. A player whose market is reportedly weaker than he and his reps expected.\n\nRecent reports have suggested the corner infielder’s market has been weak as he closes in on the Dec. 22 deadline for him to sign with an MLB team. It has created some speculation that he might just end up returning to Japan if he doesn’t get the sort of offer he is looking for. However, Ken Rosenthal doesn’t buy into that discourse.\n\nIn a new report, he spoke about how Murakami’s swing and miss rate is believed to be the big reason why some teams are balking at giving the 25-year-old a big long-term contract. Rosenthal believes that the issue is overblown, and Shohei Ohtani had a higher rate before he made the move from Japan in 2018. The MLB insider firmly believes Murakami will be playing in the MLB next season.\n\nMunetaka Murakami stats: 69 G, .286 AVG, .392 OBP, .659 SLG, 1.051 OPS, 24 HR, 52 RBI, 40 R\n\nThat is very good news for the Mets and Yankees. Despite the questions about his defense and swing and miss rate, he is one of the greatest home run hitters in Japanese baseball history, and still hasn’t even hit his prime. With far fewer teams expected to be in on him, the pair of New York clubs could get a young player with huge upside at a far cheaper rate than they expected a month ago, or for fewer years.\n\nNew York Jets Player Requests Release From Team After 28-Point Loss\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "description": "Milwaukee second baseman has shown marked improvement at plate in his three MLB seasons. Hitting .300 might not be that much out of range for Turang.",
    "fullText": "In his three MLB seasons, Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Brice Turang has seen his batting average improve 40 points each season. He's continued to show marked improvement at the plate, which might lead some Brewers fans to consider this point.\n\nCould Turang hit .300 in the 2026 MLB season? Yes, he could.\n\nLook at Turang's power numbers. In 2023, Turang hit six home runs in 404 at-bats; in 2025, he hit seven home runs in 559 at-bats; and last season, Turang hit 18 home runs in 584 at-bats. As four doubles, Turang has gone from nine to 24 to 28 over his first three seasons.\n\nThis obviously shows that Turang is getting better and better each season.\n\nBrewers manager Pat Murphy might be smiling like a proud papa when he looks out at second base and sees Turang turning double plays with ease. \"He's a ballplayer,\" Murphy has said about Turang. \"You can see it. You can smell it. The best is yet to come for him. He's got so much to give.\"\n\nWhat's next for the Brewers' team MVP from 2025? He's going to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic next year. Turang has played for Team USA in teenage baseball series and remembers those times quite vividly.\n\n\"That was some of the best times that I’ve ever had playing baseball,\" Turang said, according to an MLB.com article. \"I was looking forward to seeing who the team was [for the 2026 tournament], and when I find out it’s me, I was like, 'Oh, man, I’m excited.'\"\n\nFor the Brewers, they want to make sure that they stay atop the National League Central Division again in 2026. They'd also like a return trip to the National League Championship Series and, potentially, knock off the Los Angeles Dodgers en route to their own World Series championship.\n\nTurang is quickly ensuring that he's a fan favorite, not only for his play on the field but how he handles himself as an MLB player.\n\nThe Brewers aren't going to bring a bunch of knuckleheads into the organization. Brewers president of baseball operations Matt Arnold is very selective on who he wants to bring on the team. And, yes, you better believe Murphy has a thing or two to say when new players are being considered for the ballclub.\n\nHe's worked hard to make sure the Brewers' clubhouse is strong and full of teammates that will stick up for one another.\n\nWatch for Turang to have a great 2026 and, hopefully, have a pleasant World Baseball Classic experience and avoid getting injured.\n\nRemember to join our BREWERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE! You can post your own thoughts, in text or video form, and you can engage with our Roundtable staff, as well as other Brewers fans. If prompted to download the Roundtable APP, that's free too.",

    "fullText": "MLB free agency 2025-26 hasn’t been quite as active as everyone hoped, with many of the top MLB free agents still available as Christmas Day nears. There’s still plenty of time for big signings to happen, meaning teams that have fallen short of expectations in the open market could still turn things around.\n\nMore than a month into MLB free agency, we’re highlighting some of the winners and losers so far.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays responded to a heartbreaking loss in Game 7 of the World Series by splurging early in MLB free agency. Dylan Cease got a hefty contract, but Toronto is rightfully betting on a co-ace who finished in the 95th percentile for Whiff rate last season and in the 89th percentile for strikeout rate. To support the back of the rotation, the club brought in Cody Ponce after he turned his career around overseas. Most recently, the Blue Jays bullpen got better with the addition of Tyler Rogers (2.38 ERA over 147.2 IP in last two seasons). Best of all, there’s still a very real chance of Bo Bichette being re-signed and a potential Kyle Tucker signing.\n\nBuster Posey isn’t at fault for what’s happening with the San Francisco Giants right now. The problem is ownership. It started in March when a 10% stake in the franchise was sold to the private equity firm Sixth Street. Things don’t get better when private equity is brought in; reducing costs to increase revenue is the goal. Suddenly this offseason, the Giants reportedly aren’t interested in spending $100 million-plus on a starting pitcher. Sixth Street might not like to hear this, but that’s the going rate for quality starters in the open market. There’s no reason to expect San Francisco to start splurging later this winter.\n\nThe back-to-back World Series champions had a glaring need to address this offseason, and they took care of it quickly. Over the last three seasons, the All-Star closer ranks 11th among qualified relievers in ERA (2.48), sixth in batting average allowed ($0.173$) and third in strikeout rate (38.4%). Los Angeles needed a shutdown closer; Diaz provides it. Equally as valuable to Los Angeles, Diaz took a short-term deal (three years, $69 million) so the Dodgers are still positioning themselves for long-term flexibility if a salary cap is implemented.\n\nWe could give credit to the Pittsburgh Pirates for being aggressive early in MLB free agency and making a genuine effort to sign Kyle Schwarber. Here’s the problem: Pittsburgh is striking out on all the top MLB free agents. Why? Because Pirates owner Bob Nutting has put this franchise in such a disastrous and poorly-run state that top talent wants nothing to do with the club. So, with an MLB salary floor likely incoming, Pittsburgh will have to vastly overspend on mid-tier free agents and overpay for marginal talent just to meet the cap floor. This is what happens when an owner spends years fielding an awful team and investing as little as he can into the on-field product.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles are finally spending serious money in MLB free agency. Yes, the Pete Alonso contract (five years, $155 million) is a significant commitment to a 31-year-old who can barely play first base. However, it was also a desperately needed addition since the Orioles lineup finished 19th in slugging and 21st in OPS last season. Plus, this signing positions Baltimore to flip either Ryan Mountcastle or Coby Mayo for a starting pitcher. We’ve been waiting years for the Orioles to spend, and they finally did it; credit is due.\n\nIn the span of just a few weeks, the New York Mets moved on from Brandon Nimmo, Pete Alonso and Edwin Diaz. We can justify in some regard the decision to not re-sign Alonso, but giving Jorge Polanco $20 million per year is a massive risk given his knee issues. New York certainly improved defensively by bringing in Marcus Semien, but he’s coming off a two-year stretch at the plate with a .234/.307/.379 triple-slash line and a .686 OPS. So, if his fielding dips considerably in his age 35 season, he’s a complete negative for New York. Oh, we’re also still waiting on the Mets rotation to be addressed.",

    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith seemingly forgot the 2020 MLB season was shortened due to Covid-19 when he claimed New York Mets star Pete Alonso was injured and barely played.\n\nOn Wednesday, ESPN’s Jeff Passan announced that Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal to join the Baltimore Orioles. Alonso, 31, played his first seven seasons in the MLB with the Mets and was considered one of the faces of the franchise.\n\nBREAKING: First baseman Pete Alonso and the Baltimore Orioles are finalizing a five-year, $155 million contract, sources tell ESPN. Alonso leaves the Mets to make a loaded AL East even better.\n\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 10, 2025\n\nHours later, Smith reacted to the news on The Stephen A. Smith Show. First, he lambasted the Mets for allowing star closer Edwin Diaz to sign with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers. He applied that same criticism to Alonso’s departure.\n\nWhile talking about Alonso’s stats, however, Smith appeared to overlook a vitally important piece of context:\n\nHe’s been in the league about seven years. Let’s look at him, alright? He got injured in year two. So, he hits 53 home runs and 120 RBIs his first year in 2019. Next year, he gets hurt, only played in 57 games. Still smacks 16 home runs, 35 RBIs. Next year, 37 home runs, 94 RBIs. The year after that, 2022, 40 home runs, 131 RBIs.\n\nTo Smith’s credit, he quickly realized his mistake with the 2020 season. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the MLB regular season was only 60 games. With 57 games played, Alonso appeared in nearly every game of that shortened season.\n\n“Actually, 2020 was Covid,” Smith clarified. “I apologize. You gotta remember that, because there was a truncated season because all the stuff that was going on in Covid.”\n\nUnfortunately for Smith, the damage was already done and social media users rushed to roast him for the error.\n\nStephen A Smith said Pete Alonso \"got hurt and only played in 57 games his 2nd season\", when really it was the 60 game shortened COVID season\n\n— Fuzzy (@fuzzyfromyt) December 11, 2025\n\nSAS and @ColinCowherd have made a fortune talking about sports despite knowing nothing about sports. It's legit impressive. https://t.co/sdFldE7oIR\n\n— Funhouse (@BackAftaThis) December 12, 2025\n\nHas anyone ever brought up the fact that these guys are simply on TV so often that it’s actually not shocking at all that they don’t follow sports? https://t.co/ZpAeKvuRDl\n\n— Tim Kalinowski (@TimmyKal12) December 12, 2025\n\nHighest paid sports \"commentator\" in the business btw https://t.co/fN2CvjZbgj\n\n— Dean Kremer Enjoyer (@DK_Enj) December 11, 2025\n\nThis clown is the highest paid employee at ESPN https://t.co/JgIjYkf17t\n\n— cg (@colingreten) December 12, 2025\n\nAnd to think Stephen A.

    "fullText": "The 2025 MLB winter meetings are over, and there were plenty of big takeaways with some of the biggest names off the board in a few days.\n\nThe Ketel Marte trade rumors swirled. The New York Mets saw Edwin Diaz leave for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Pete Alonso sign a big contract with the Baltimore Orioles (which left Mets fans NOT OK). Kyle Schwarber is still a member of the Philadelphia Phillies. Whew! That's a lot of news!\n\nBut there are still some big names left to be signed. So we're rounding them up for you in order of talent. Let's go:\n\nThe jewel of the offseason didn't sign anywhere. Whoever signing him should be prepared to dole out A LOT of money for a player who can do it all.\n\nHe was positively raking before a knee injury prematurely ended his regular season. Anyone looking for a shortstop who can drive in runs would love to sign him.\n\nHe's 32 and spent some time on the injured list this season. But he's still a top infield option for contenders.\n\nWere his numbers inflated thanks to Yankee Stadium? We'll see if that's true, if he signs elsewhere.\n\nThe pitcher who went from bullpen stud to solid starter should get paid.\n\nHe's probably a middle-of-the-rotation guy, but a VERY valuable one if he keeps this up.\n\nHis rough end of season may be a factor, but he's still a top-end starting pitcher still in his prime. That's worth a lot.\n\nThe Japanese slugger has been posted by his team, the Yakult Swallows, and he could be a sneaky good addition.\n\nHe's getting up there in age (34) but he can still hit dingers.\n\nAnother Japanese name who could end up being worth the investment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: MLB rumors: Best remaining free agents after 2025 winter meetings",

    "fullText": "Mets slammed as “doomed” by former MLB execs after Alonso news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt took less than a day for the mood of New York Mets’ observers to hit rock bottom. After losing All-Star closer Edwin Diaz to the Los Angeles Dodgers, former MLB general managers Jim Duquette, Jim Bowden and Steve Phillips spent the morning on MLB Network Radio suggesting the New York Mets should be “panicked.” Hours later, it was reported that Pete Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles, and the same group reportedly shifted their tone to “doomed.”\n\nSNY broadcaster and former Met Ron Darling on MLB Network’s MLB Tonight said he was “flabbergasted.”\n\nAlonso’s departure is not only a big blow to the Mets’ offseason plans, but it ends a franchise era.\n\nAlonso, who turned 31 Sunday,  hit .272 with 38 home runs, 126 RBI and an .871 OPS over 162 games last season. He finishes his Mets tenure with 264 career home runs, the most in franchise history, along with 712 RBI and a .253 career batting average.\n\nThat’s elite middle-of-the-order production vanishing overnight.\n\nNew York also missed on a potential left-handed power fit when Kyle Schwarber re-signed with Philadelphia.  Brandon Nimmo’s departure via trade to the Texas Rangers for Marcus Semien creates even more questions for the Mets.\n\nEven at closer, the Mets are asked to trust Devin Williams, a new arrival and high-pressure answer after Diaz left for Los Angeles on a three-year, $69 million deal. Mets GM David Stearns said they think that Williams’ career-worst year against the Mets in 2025 was because he was “unlucky.”\n\nWith the biggest names gone, Stearns must get creative. Options remain, but none come without risk — and none replace Alonso’s presence by themselves.\n\nHere are the most realistic paths still on the board:\n\nCody Bellinger\nA lefty bat with defensive flexibility in the outfield and at first base. Once an MVP-caliber slugger, he hit .272 with 29 homers last season.\n\nOne of the few impact bats left on the market after 2025: last season he hit .266 with 22 home runs, 73 RBI, 91 runs scored, and compiled an .841 OPS in 136 games.\n\nAlex Bregman\nA high-floor infielder who could stabilize the batting order, but doesn’t replace pure first-base power. He’s one of the bigger bats still available.\n\nBo Bichette\nMore contact hitter than slugger, but an impact offensive piece who could reshape the overall lineup profile.\n\nThose names provide lineup value, but the Mets lost production and popular players.\n\nAlsono was not only a durable first baseman who has led the MLB in home runs since his debut. Diaz was a closer who electrified Citi Field with his entrances and dominated in high leverage.  Fans identified with them, and their teammates reportedly embraced them.\n\nThe former GMs on MLB Network Radio have seen enough offseasons to know when desperation is creeping in. Two franchise pillars are gone. The division remains brutal. And the fan base just watched its most iconic slugger pack for Baltimore.\n\nDarling was blunt in his assessment, too.\n\n\"This is a real loss for the New York Mets,\" Darling said.\n\nIf the Mets don’t respond aggressively and fast, this winter may be remembered not as a turning point but as a full-scale collapse.",

There have been rumors suggesting the Los Angeles Dodgers could be closing in on a trade for Skubal; however, those rumors have been shut down.\n\nThe “Skubal to Dodgers” rumors at the Winter Meetings are all smoke and “not real,” as reported by FanSided’s Robert Murray on The Baseball Insiders. As of now, it doesn’t appear that Skubal will be traded from Detroit, but if an offer blows away the organization, it could entice them to pull the trigger.\n\nThe Tigers want to keep Skubal and pursue a trip to the 2026 World Series, but more needs to be done. If Detroit keeps the back-to-back AL Cy Young Award winner, it needs to make moves to maximize the 2026 season. If not, the Tigers would be better off trading Skubal to maximize his value.\n\nSkubal would demand a very, very big trade package, and unless a team is willing to meet Detroit’s demands, it doesn’t seem likely to happen this winter. The Tigers need to pick a lane on Skubal, but for now, the rumors of a trade to the Dodgers don’t seem to have any legs.\n\nBaltimore Orioles sign Pete Alonso to massive five-year contract\n\nBaltimore Orioles discussing historic trade with Washington in 2025\n\nLatest MLB Rumors on Braves Caution, Reds-Marte, Mets-Alonso, Blue Jays Trade",

    "fullText": "MLB Winter Meetings tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWinter Meetings latest news and rumors\n\nFree agent signings and trades by team\n\nThe MLB offseason can move at a painfully slow pace, but if history is any indication, December will be the busiest month, thanks in part to the Winter Meetings.\n\nThe annual congregation of executives, managers and free agents and, of course, agents takes place in Orlando this year, and there is plenty of business to get done.\n\nA fairly impressive crop of free agents is mostly unsigned, though there are some exceptions. Dylan Cease already landed with the Toronto Blue Jays on a seven-year, $210 million deal, while Josh Naylor and Devin Williams are among other names who have earned new deals in the weeks leading up to the Winter Meetings.\n\nThe trade market could be worth watching more closely than the free-agent market as the Winter Meetings play out. While a Tarik Skubal trade doesn't seem imminent or even particularly likely this offseason, Ketel Marte, MacKenzie Gore and Jarren Duran are among the names who have surfaced in rumors.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking all of the latest buzz below, from rumors to signings and trades. Follow along with the latest updates below.\n\nMORE:Ranking the top MLB free agents\n\nThe Red Sox are seen as strong candidates for Ketel Marte compared to the Blue Jays because of their young starting pitching depth, Jon Morosi reports. The Diamondbacks have been known to be targeting young starters in any Marte talks.\n\nThe Tigers have agreed to a two-year, $19 million deal to bring back reliever Kyle Finnegan. Acquired from the Nationals at the July deadline, Finnegan impressed with a 1.50 ERA and 11.5 K/9 rate in 16 appearances with the Tigers, putting himself in line for save opportunities in 2026.\n\nThe Orioles and Nationals have had \"steady communication\" about SP MacKenzie Gore, whose name has been floated in trade rumors since the July deadline, Jon Morosi reports.\n\nTampa Bay's Brandon Lowe is among the names surfacing in trade talks for second basemen, and the chances of a deal this week are \"increasing,\" Jon Morosi reports.\n\nThe market for Diamondbacks 2B Ketel Marte is \"heating up,\" Jon Heyman reports, with the Red Sox, Mariners, Blue Jays, Phillies and Rays all believed to be in the mix for the All-Star.\n\nThe Red Sox have discussed a Corey Seager trade with the Rangers, the Boston Globe reports, though WEEI's Rob Bradford says the talks don't have momentum at the moment. Seager has been a superstar with the Rangers when healthy, but Texas is on a mission to shed salary this winter and the two-time World Series MVP still has six years remaining on his massive contract.\n\nThe Marlins are \"engaged\" in trade talks involving SP Edward Cabrera with numerous teams, Jon Heyman reports. Cabrera enjoyed a breakout season for Miami in 2025 and was a popular name leading up to the July deadline.\n\nThe Pirates have agreed to a one-year, $7.75 million deal with reliever Gregory Soto, who posted a 4.18 ERA and 3.42 FIP between the Orioles and Mets in 2025.\n\nThe Cubs met with the star infielder over Zoom \"a few weeks ago,\" per Robert Murray.\n\nWith Kyle Schwarber off the market, and Baltimore being one potential landing spot for him, Morosi reports that the Orioles have spoken with the camp of Kyle Tucker.\n\nBefore Kyle Schwarber agreed to re-sign with the Phillies, Baltimore matched Philadelphia's offer of five years, $150 million, per Rosenthal. The Reds offered Schwarber a five-year deal \"in the $125 million range,\" while the Pirates offered four years and $120 million.\n\nPer Jon Morosi, within the AL East, the Red Sox are viewed as a stronger trade candidate for star infielder Ketel Marte than the Blue Jays, because of Boston's depth of MLB-ready starters.\n\nSpeaking at the Winter Meetings, agent Scott Boras said he expects 1B Pete Alonso's market to pick up now that Kyle Schwarber has signed. Alonso has reportedly been in and out of the meetings to meet with teams, including the Red Sox and Orioles.\n\nThe Tigers have been floated as a potential Alex Bregman suitor, but they also have real interest in SS Ha-Seong Kim, according to the Detroit Free Press. Kim, a terrific defender, landed with the Rays last offseason but missed most of 2025 and finished the year with the Braves. After a healthy September, Kim opted out of his deal.\n\nThe Mets \"may be hesitant to go more than three years\" on a new deal for 1B Pete Alonso, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reports, which could complicate the path to a reunion between the two sides. Alonso settled for a short deal last winter but is looking for long-term security this time around after a strong season at the plate.\n\nThe Angels are acquiring infielder Vaughn Grissom from the Red Sox, in exchange for OF prospect Isaiah Jackson. Grissom, Boston's one-for-one return for Chris Sale two years ago, struggled in a brief MLB stint in 2024 and spent all of 2025 in the minor leagues, posting a .783 OPS. 2026 will be Grissom's age-25 season.\n\nThe Padres and GM A.J. Preller are \"shooting big\" in trade talks and working on \"multiple fronts\" to put together significant deals, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports.\n\nWith the Mets' former closer, Edwin Diaz, off the market, New York is now viewed as a suitor for the new top available reliever, Robert Suarez. The Blue Jays are also in the mix, per Jon Morosi.\n\nFormer Mets closer Edwin Diaz has agreed to a deal with the Dodgers, according to The Athletic's Will Sammon, bolstering a bullpen that was a rare weakness for much of the regular season in 2025.\n\nDiaz's deal is worth $69 million over three years, per Jeff Passan.\n\nThe Phillies have agreed to a five-year, $150 million deal to re-sign DH Kyle Schwarber, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. Schwarber, who was the runner-up for NL MVP in 2025, was also pursued by the Reds, Pirates, Orioles and Mets.\n\nWhile the Red Sox are taking a look at a bevy of infielders, including Pete Alonso, Bo Bichette and Ketel Marte, a reunion with Alex Bregman remains Boston's \"No. 1 target,\" according to The Athletic. A trade for Isaac Paredes could be a fallback option if a deal can't be reached with Bregman.\n\nHarris answered a question about Tarik Skubal's trade status, as the executive said he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't listen. Skubal has one year left on his contract, which could prompt Detroit to trade him before the season begins if the team gets a good deal.\n\nMatz is a former starter who transitioned to the bullpen last season, and found success with the Red Sox late in the year, finishing the season with a 3.05 ERA between St. Louis and Boston. Topkin adds that the deal will span two years.\n\nMegill was the best relievers on the Brewers last year, but Milwaukee is always exploring different ways to mix up its team. The Yankees have a reliever vacancy after losing Devin Williams to the Mets in free agency, but the Mets also still need to upgrade their bullpen.\n\nAccording to Rome, no deal is close, but Houston's interest in Baz is real and could be the type of move that the team prefers. Baz is coming off a season where he made a career-high 31 starts for the Rays, but still pitched to a 4.87 ERA.\n\nGore is one of several pitchers who could be traded, as the Nats look to build for the future. While Golden also reports the Red Sox and Padres explored a Gore trade at the trade deadline, he specifically names the Yankees as a team that has made a call in recent days.\n\nSuarez is one of the top relievers on the market, and the Mets, Blue Jays and Dodgers are all teams that have shown interest in improving their bullpens. Those three teams have also been linked to top closer Edwin Diaz, which makes Suarez a potential fallback option.\n\nCotillo added that other teams may be waiting for Schwarber to sign before moving on to other players. While the Phillies are believed to be the favorite to retain the DH, but the Red Sox, Mets, Reds and Pirates have all been linked to Schwarber as well.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are willing to listen on 2B Ketel Marte and are emphasizing MLB-ready starting pitchers in talks, but their asking price remains high, according to Jon Morosi. Marte has been one of the hottest names as the Winter Meetings get underway, indicating teams believe he can be had in a trade, and interested teams  reportedly include the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Mariners.\n\nThe Orioles are in on free agent starter Ranger Suarez, Jon Heyman reports. Suarez is one of the top free agent arms available, and Baltimore has been connected to starters since the offseason began.\n\nFree agent 1B Pete Alonso is heading to the Winter Meetings to meet with interested suitors, including the Red Sox and Orioles, according to the New York Post. Alonso lives a short drive away from Orlando, so he will meet in-person with interested teams.\n\nYankees GM Brian Cashman said at the Winter Meetings that the organization is \"open-minded\" but doesn't have to do as much as last winter because of the talent on the roster. \"We have really good players on this roster, and we are covered in most all areas that you need to be covered.\"\n\nThe Nationals are receiving heavy interest in SS CJ Abrams in trade talks and are open to dealing him, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon report. Washington is also talking about deals centered on SP MacKenzie Gore as the new front office looks to shake up the organization.\n\nThe Blue Jays are also among teams talking to the Diamondbacks about 2B Ketel Marte, Jon Heyman reports. The Red Sox and Mariners were reported Sunday as potential suitors for Marte, though there doesn't appear to be much traction in talks yet, Heyman reports.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have agreed to a one-year, $7.5 million deal with pitcher Michael Soroka. Soroka split the 2025 season with the Nationals and Cubs, posting a 4.87 ERA and 4.16 FIP over 16 starts with Washington before an injury limited him to 8.1 strong innings with Chicago. Soroka could function as either a starter or reliever in Arizona.\n\nDiamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte is in high demand this offseason, as a number of suitors have pursued the All-Star infielder. The Red Sox, Mariners, Pirates, Rays, Tigers and Jays are all listed as targets by New York Post's Jon Heyman.\n\nOne of the top arms available on the market, Valdez has been travelling from coast to coast, as it's reported he's visited Baltimore, New York and San Francisco. The 32-year-old lefty finished his eighth season in Houston last year with a .366 ERA.\n\nThe Pirates said they were looking to spend this offseason around Paul Skenes. How about Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber? Pittsburgh has reportedly put a four-year offer in for the free agent, while Red Sox, Cubs, Reds and others remain in the mix.\n\nThe Mariners have acquire reliever Jose Ferrer from the Nationals, in exchange for catching prospect Harry Ford and pitching prospect Isaac Lyon. The 25-year-old Ferrer has unspectacular raw numbers as a major-leaguer, but a career 3.33 FIP, impressive walk rate and high velocity make him a potential high-leverage reliever for Seattle, while Ford is a consensus top-75 prospect in baseball and could be the Nationals' catcher of the future.\n\nDespite July's firesale, the Minnesota Twins are not planning to trade Joe Ryan, Byron Buxton or Pablo Lopez this winter, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports. The Twins discussed a Ryan trade with the Boston Red Sox at the deadline but decided against dealing their young ace.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers remain \"engaged\" with teams on a potential Tarik Skubal trade, according to ESPN's Buster Olney, but they are still unsure about dealing him and have an \"enormous\" asking price. Skubal, the back-to-back reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, is set to be a free agent after the 2026 season and is reportedly far apart in extension talks with the Tigers.\n\nP Ryan Yarbrough (re-signed, 1yr/$2.5M)\n\nP Drew Anderson (1yr/$7M with $10M option for 2027)\n\nRP Kyle Finnegan (re-signed, 2yr/$19M)\n\n1B Josh Naylor (re-signed, 5yr/$92.5M)\n\nDH Kyle Schwarber (re-signed, 5yr/$150M)\n\nCL Emilio Pagan (re-signed, 2yr/$20M)\n\nC James McCann (re-signed, 1yr/$2.75M)\n\nINF Miguel Rojas (re-signed, 1yr/$5.5M)\n\nHere are the remaining free agents from SN's ranking of the top 27 free agents this winter:\n\nJapanese standouts Tatsuya Imai and Kazuma Okamoto were also posted and are available to MLB teams, making for one of the strongest-ever free agent crops of Japanese talent in one offseason.",

    "fullText": "The Mets lost closer Edwin Díaz to the reigning champions Dodgers, with the reliever agreeing to a three year, $69 million contract with Los Angeles and setting a new AAV record for relievers.\n\nThe Mets’ offer to Díaz was for three years and $66 million with some deferrals, though they expressed a willingness to improve the number.\n\nA few factors impacted the Mets’ ability to retain Díaz outside of the pure dollar amount at play.\n\nThe Dodgers’ deal with Díaz also includes some deferrals, about $4.5 million deferred per year.\n\nAnthony DiComo rounded up all the important bits of the Díaz signing and the fallout for the Mets.\n\nDevin Williams was surprised that Díaz did not return, and he expressed excitement at the opportunity to earn the closer role.\n\nDíaz wasn’t the only reliever the Mets lost, as Gregory Soto signed with the Pirates on a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nThe Mets also made an offer to Kyle Schwarber before he re-signed with Philadelphia, offering around three years and $120 million for the free agent slugger.\n\nStar free agent Pete Alonso will now take up more of the spotlight with Schwarber off the board.\n\nThe Mets are reportedly reluctant to go past three years with Alonso.\n\nAnd while the Mets remain interested in a reunion with Alonso, other options exist and remain in play for the team.\n\nDespite the blows taken by the Mets, David Stearns is still optimistic about the team’s offseason.\n\nStearns still understands why Mets fans are feeling frustrated, especially in the wake of how 2025 ended.\n\nJohn Harper wrote about whether Stearns has a plan fans should trust and what things might be other valuable parts of contract decisions other than pure player value.\n\nThe Mets are willing to listen to trade offers for All-Star starter David Peterson, though the price will be considerable.\n\nThe draft lottery was held yesterday, and because the Mets landed outside of the protected top ten picks, the Mets’ pick was docked ten spots and will be 27th overall.\n\nThe Mets and Starling Marte reportedly have mutual interest in a reunion.\n\nHaving spent years with the Mets, Tommy Tanous has been hired by the Rockies as an assistant general manager.\n\nMLB.com looked at the fallout in the wake of the Díaz and Schwarber signings, including where the Mets go from here.\n\nKyle Schwarber returned to the Phillies, agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract.\n\nHis contract is an anomaly in baseball, but Jayson Stark explained why it fits such an unique player.\n\nLeft hander Alec Gamboa and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league split contract with an invite to spring training.\n\nThe Red Sox also traded infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox landed the number one pick in the 2026 draft.\n\nAfter being traded to Detroit last season, Kyle Finnegan re-signed with the Tigers on a two-year contract worth $19 million.\n\nA Pod of Their Own was back with another episode.\n\nDecember 10th is a very busy trade day in Mets history, with three major trades taking place on this date.",
