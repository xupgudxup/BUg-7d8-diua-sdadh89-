    "description": "Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.  Main Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States. At the news conference, MLB staff assembled duffel bags with goods for foster care children.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

The Mammoth opened a seven-game homestand, rebounding from a 3-2 overtime loss to the New York Rangers on Monday night.\n\nRidly Greig scored for Ottawa, and Leevi Merilainen stopped 18 shots.

    "description": "The game will be played at University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City.",
    "fullText": "The Wasatch Mountain Range of the Greater Rockies will serve as the backdrop for the 2027 NHL Winter Classic. University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium will be the site of the league's signature regular-season event, which the Utah Mammoth will host in the franchise's third season.\n\nThe Mammoth will welcome the Colorado Avalanche in a college football venue that seats approximately 51,400 on a fall Saturday in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe date of the game has yet to be finalized, but NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Mammoth owners Ryan and Ashley Smith revealed the matchup Wednesday, along with Mammoth center Logan Cooley.\n\nLogan Cooley on getting to play in the 2027 Winter Classic at Rice-Eccles Stadium: pic.twitter.com/SduTSBg5ah\n\n— Jenna Fink (@jennamfink) January 7, 2026\n\nThe Mammoth, who formed after the Arizona Coyotes were dissolved in April 2024, are currently in their second season.\n\nAfter an 8-2 start to the season, they're now 20-20-3 and in fourth place of the Central Division with 43 points.\n\nThis season, the Mammoth still have one more head-to-head meeting versus the Avalanche, who are the division leaders with a 31-4-7 record. Colorado is also atop the Western Conference at the moment with 69 points.\n\nThe Mammoth and Avalanche have met six times over the past two seasons, with Colorado holding a five-point advantage over Utah in the series. Their lone remaining matchup during the 2025-26 season is on Feb. 25 in Utah.\n\nNext season's Winter Classic will mark the Avalanche's fourth appearance in an outdoor game. Utah, on the other hand, will soon become the 32nd NHL franchise to play in an outdoor game.\n\nThe Classic started as an annual tradition on Jan. 1, 2008. At the time, the Buffalo Sabres played the Pittsburgh Penguins at what was then known as Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, home of the NFL's Buffalo Bills.\n\nThis year's Winter Classic was held Jan. 2 at the Miami Marlins' loanDepot Park. The New York Rangers defeated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers 5-1.\n\nIt was the fifth straight Classic at a baseball stadium.\n\nThat streak will end next season in Salt Lake City, where the University of Utah's campus will take center stage, as Rice-Eccles becomes the fourth college football stadium to host the event.\n\nNotably, Rice-Eccles also put on the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics. It's scheduled to fulfill the same role when the Games return to Utah in 2034.",
