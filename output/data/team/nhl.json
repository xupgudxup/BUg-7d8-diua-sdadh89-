    "fullText": "STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Penn State hockey star Gavin McKenna, a freshman center and the presumptive top pick in this summer’s NHL draft, has been charged with felony assault following an incident on Jan. 31.\n\nMcKenna, 18, was also charged with simple assault, harassment and disorderly conduct, according to court documents. He was awaiting a preliminary hearing as of Wednesday.\n\nDetails of the allegations against McKenna were not immediately available. His representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.\n\nThe incident happened in the hours after Penn State lost to No. 2 Michigan State in an outdoor game at Beaver Stadium, home of the Nittany Lions football team.\n\nMcKenna, who is from Whitehorse, Yukon, has 11 goals and 21 assists in 24 games this season for the Nittany Lions. He decided to play for Penn State after the NCAA lifted its ban on Canadian Hockey League players competing at the Division I level.\n\nA name, image and likeness deal with the Nittany Lions helped sway McKenna to join a program that has been at the Division I level for less than 15 years.\n\nMcKenna recently had four goals and six assists at the World Junior Championships while helping Canada to a bronze medal.",

Raddysh scored a goal for the fourth consecutive game to set a franchise record for a defenseman. Paul then tapped in a pass from Guentzel to make it 5-4.\n\n“It was the game had everything,’’ Lightning head coach Jon Cooper said. “It had the weather in a state which doesn’t usually get weather like this. It was a phenomenal atmosphere, perfect ice hockey playing conditions. You had goalie fights, you had 11 goals, you had a shootout. It had everything. That one’s going to go in the memory bank. It was a special occasion.’’\n\nBruins: At Florida on Wednesday night.\n\nLightning: Host Buffalo on Tuesday night.",

    "fullText": "One of the NHL’s newest and most hotly-contested rivalries is set to begin a new chapter tonight.\n\nOn Thursday, the Golden Knights begin a run of five straight Western Conference opponents before the Olympic break, starting with the Dallas Stars.\n\nVenue: T-Mobile Arena, Paradise, NV\n\nRight now, the Golden Knights appear to be on the wrong side of being streaky. Last time out, they fell to the Montreal Canadiens to drop their fourth game out of their last five. Inconsistency continues to be a theme this season for the Golden Knights, and they need to find some way to get it out quickly.\n\nHere is how one of the more challenging games left on the docket can be a starting point.\n\nIf there is one thing the Golden Knights need to avoid like the plague, it is taking unnecessary penalties.\n\nWhile the exploits of the Golden Knights and Pavel Dorofeyev on the power play have been excellent, the Stars are one of the few teams that have an edge against them on the man advantage. Dallas boasts the league’s most efficient power play unit, clocking in at a 29.9% success rate and lead by Vegas nemesis Wyatt Johnston’s 17 goals. A lack of discipline could lead to the Golden Knights once again falling on the wrong side of a blowout.\n\nIt feels as though the formula for beating the Golden Knights has become too apparent: take advantage of their mistakes.\n\nThe numbers unfortunately back this up, with the Golden Knights featuring the sixth-most giveaways per game (16.1) and sitting in the bottom five in save percentage (.877). Too many mistakes have ended up in the back of their own net, and Bruce Cassidy’s attempts to clean things up have had varying degrees of success. Starting with this game, the Golden Knights will have to be more responsible with the puck to help their goaltenders out.\n\nIf there is one thing the Golden Knights do have in their favor, it is that they rise to the challenge when the situation calls for it.\n\nDorofeyev’s equalizer against the Canadiens marked the 68th third period goal for the Golden Knights, placing the team second in that category. Whether aiming to hold a lead or trying to chase to force overtime, something about the final stanza pushes the team into overdrive. If the Golden Knights can establish themselves early on, their late-game effectiveness could prove crucial in securing a big win.",

    "fullText": "The NHL is through 16 weeks of the regular season. The Colorado Avalanche have a strong lead in the league, but the Detroit Red Wings and Carolina Hurricanes continue their strong play. The Vancouver Canucks increase their likelihood of having the best odds in the upcoming draft, and the Dallas Stars have found themselves in a tough situation. The Stars were one of the best teams in the league but have struggled of late. Now is the time for the front office to acquire help and get Dallas back on track. Here are the NHL team power rankings heading into Week 17.\n\nVancouver is going nowhere fast. The front office is looking to the future and hoping to land the top pick in the upcoming draft. The Canucks rank 29th in goals scored and 32nd in goals allowed per game.\n\nThe Blues’ offense is one of the league’s worst. They rank 32nd in goals scored per game. St. Louis is headed for a fire sale at the trade deadline. Now is the time to stockpile draft assets for the future.\n\nWinnipeg has yet to right the ship, and most of its issues start on the away ice. The Jets are one of the league’s worst in away games. The team’s goalies rank 18th in goals allowed per game, but the offense ranks 22nd in goals scored per game.\n\nCalgary’s goaltending is the main reason for the team’s success. The Flames’ goaltenders rank 11th in goals allowed per game. Offense has been an ongoing issue, and Calgary ranks 31st in goals scored per game.\n\nGoaltender Igor Shesterkin was injured, and the team started its downward spiral. Shesterkin led one of the league’s best goaltending units, but the team ranks 21st in goals allowed per game. The offense hasn’t helped, ranked 27th in goals scored per game.\n\nConnor Bedard missed time from December 13th to January 8th. Since returning on January 9th, the team has won three of eight games. The young Chicago team needs additional players to step up.\n\nNashville has played well over the past 10 games. However, goaltending remains an issue. The team ranks 29th in goals allowed per game compared to 23rd in goals scored per game.\n\nIf San Jose can fix its goaltending woes, the team can go on a run. Center Macklin Celebrini is single-handedly keeping the Sharks in play for a Wild Card spot. The team’s goaltenders rank 30th in goals allowed per game.\n\nColumbus has gained ground over its last 10 games but continues to struggle away from home ice. The Blue Jackets rank 19th in goals scored and 25th in goals allowed per game. There is a chance they sneak into a Wild Card spot.\n\nThe Kraken have hit a rough stretch and have dropped valuable points. The team’s issues arise from the league’s 25th–ranked offense. Seattle’s goaltenders rank 12th in goals allowed per game.\n\nThe Kings are in a rut and struggle on home ice. Winning at home will increase the likelihood of the team finding itself in the playoffs. Los Angeles’ goaltenders rank 4th in goals allowed per game, but the offense ranks 30th in goals scored per game.\n\nThe Senators play in the league’s only division where each team has reached at least 50 points. This doesn’t help Ottawa’s chances of making a playoff push. The team ranks 12th in goals scored and 28th in goals allowed per game.\n\nThe Devils are treading water, and their goaltenders have kept them in contention for wins. New Jersey’s goaltenders rank 15th in goals allowed per game. The team’s offense must improve, as it ranks 28th in goals scored per game.\n\nThe Leafs are trying to go on a run, but road losses are preventing success. Toronto’s offense is producing and ranks 8th in goals scored per game. However, goaltending is an issue, and the team ranks 26th in goals allowed per game.\n\nPhiladelphia is hanging around, but the team is average. The Flyers rank 20th in goals scored and goals allowed per game. The front office must acquire offensive help.\n\nWashington is struggling, but this isn’t uncommon. In recent seasons, the Capitals have repeated such play before going on a hot streak. The team ranks 13th in goals scored and 10th in goals allowed per game.\n\nUtah has secured valuable points over the last 10 games and ranks 4th in the Central Division. The team’s goaltenders have played well, ranking 5th in goals allowed per game. The Mammoth are a team to watch as the season enters crunch time.\n\nAnaheim is gaining ground and sits three points behind first in the Pacific Division. The glaring issue is goaltending. The Ducks’ goaltenders rank 31st in goals allowed per game.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk has returned, and Florida is ready to go on a run. Tkachuk’s return will help the Panthers’ offense, which ranks 21st in goals scored per game. However, the team’s goaltending must improve as they rank 23rd in goals allowed per game.\n\nThe Islanders have remained consistent through 16 weeks of the regular season. The team’s goaltending has played well and ranks 5th in goals allowed per game. New York can use a boost on offense.\n\nThe Oilers are keeping pace with Vegas. Edmonton has started its push for the top spot in the Pacific Division. The Oilers’ goaltending has improved and now ranks 22nd in goals allowed per game.\n\nThe Golden Knights are doing their best to hold the top spot in the Pacific Division. The team has done well over the last 10 games. Vegas ranks 4th in goals scored and 14th in goals allowed per game.\n\nBoston’s gained traction over its last 10 games. Unfortunately, the four teams ahead of them continue to play well. The Bruins rank 9th in goals scored and 19th in goals allowed per game.\n\nThe Canadiens are making life difficult for the rest of the Atlantic Division. They have played consistent hockey for 16 weeks. The team’s glaring issue is goaltending.\n\nPittsburgh’s hot stretch has them six points behind Carolina for the Metropolitan Division lead. After righting the ship, the Penguins rank 10th in goals scored and 9th in goals allowed per game. The front office will add key pieces at the trade deadline.\n\nOver the past two months, Buffalo has been on a tear. The team sits 3rd in the Atlantic Division. The Sabres rank 7th in goals scored and 15th in goals allowed per game.\n\nThe Stars have struggled over the last 10 games. The front office must make moves as the trade deadline approaches. The team’s goaltending ranks 3rd in goals allowed per game compared to 11th in goals scored per game. Trade deadline acquisitions can help improve the league’s 16th–ranked penalty kill unit.\n\nMinnesota trails Colorado in the Central Division but continues to play great hockey. The team ranks 16th in goals scored and 8th in goals allowed per game. The Wild will make the division a close race as the regular season plays out.\n\nTampa Bay is one of the league’s hottest teams. The Lightning are doing their best to overtake Detroit for the Atlantic Division lead. The Lightning rank 2nd in goals scored and goals allowed per game.\n\nDetroit has done its best to keep its lead in the Atlantic Division. The Lightning have been hot, but the Red Wings are doing their best to increase production. Detroit ranks 17th in goals scored and 13th in goals allowed per game.\n\nCarolina continues to lead the Metropolitan Division. Pittsburgh is catching up, but the team shows no signs of slowing down. The Hurricanes rank 3rd in goals scored and 7th in goals allowed per game.\n\nThroughout 16 weeks, no team is close to Colorado. The Avalanche are the league’s best team and rightfully so. Colorado ranks 1st in goals scored and goals allowed per game.\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nCFB:Most impactful transfer of 2025 college football season\n\nNBA: NBA star Derrick Rose reacts after unexpected surprise ahead of jersey retirement\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl LX graphic resurfaces\n\nTENNIS: Valentin Vacherot hits physics-defying shot at Australian Open\n\nVIRAL: Alex Honnold takes incredible selfie after historic Taipei 101 climb\n\nThe post NHL Power Rankings, 32 teams ranked from worst to first  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "title": "2025-26 NHL Fantasy Hockey Week 17 Primer And Pickups: Kings Have A Busy Schedule",
    "description": "The Los Angeles Kings play five times in the final week of fantasy hockey before a lengthy matchup that starts before the NHL's Olympic break and ends after it.",
    "fullText": "While the Olympic break obviously makes NHL scheduling a lot more difficult, it is curious that Week 17 of the fantasy hockey season ends on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nIt's a standard seven-day week, but that means Week 18 will run from Monday, Feb. 2 to Sunday, March 1, putting the Olympics right in the middle of the matchup.\n\nWould it not have made more sense for the Olympic break to be the cut-off between Weeks 17 and 18, and run Week 17 from Monday, Jan. 26 to Thursday, Feb. 5 (11 days) and then Week 18 from Wednesday, Feb. 25 to Sunday, March 8 (12 days)? Anyway, I digress.\n\n(Week 18's primer will likely be split into two parts, one for Feb. 2 to 5, and then an update for Feb. 25 to March 8).\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings are the highlight in Week 17 with a league-high five games, though they're all on the road with two back-to-backs. The matchups are not easy, and with Sunday in Carolina being their fifth game in seven days – that one seems like a scheduled loss.\n\nThere are seven teams – the Islanders, Bruins, Golden Knights, Blue Jackets, Flyers, Mammoth and Rangers – that play four times, including a back-to-back, home-and-home series between the Isles and Rangers. That's a matchup where targeting Isles would be beneficial. Bo Horvat is back in the lineup and providing a more balanced offense, and the Rangers are completely lost in net without Igor Shesterkin.\n\nIt's a very heavy Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday schedule, so plan accordingly, as there's only one game on Friday and three games on Sunday, leaving little wiggle room if you're far behind entering Saturday's games.\n\nAll positions and rostered percentages are courtesy of Yahoo Fantasy.\n\nPick players from teams at the top of the schedule matrix to maximize games and matchups. Green is good. Red is bad. Points percentages are as of Sunday morning.\n\nFantilli's fantasy value this season has oscillated from potential breakout star to occasional streamer with occasional hot streaks. Note, however, Fantilli's seen increased ice time under Rick Bowness, and he's responded accordingly with plenty of shots, hits and faceoff wins. With increased ice time, the offensive production should come. So far, Fantilli has been underwhelming, and if there's a stat that might point toward a turnaround under Bowness, it's his curiously low 9.3 shooting percentage.\n\nKent Johnson was the flavor of the week last week, but the spike in ice time was likely Bowness trying to see what Johnson can do, and the 11:15 of ice time versys Dallas and 13:12 versus Tampa is evidence Bowness wasn't impressed.\n\nNHL Power Rankings: Each Team's Biggest Trade Bait Will there be more trades before the Olympic break? The action's already heating up as we look at one player per team who could be traded in this week's NHL power rankings.\n\nCirelli has two goals and six points in his past three games, taking over L1 from the injured Brayden Point and Nick Paul dropping down to L4. Dominic James gets L2 with Jake Guentzel, but Cirelli is the safer option. The Lightning can change up their lines at any moment – their blueline is decimated once again with Erik Cernak injured – but Cirelli's the most logical player to target for L1/PP2 upside on an excellent team.\n\nAlex Lyon's 26-save shutout against the Isles gives me pause on holding Luukkonen all season because it gives the Sabres a legitimate case for all three of their goalies to see increased playing time. Remember, too, it was difficult for Luukkonen to get into a rhythm when he played so sparingly upon returning from injury.\n\nWith no back-to-backs and only three games in Week 17, it's very probable Luukkonen only sees action once, with Luukkonen, Lyon and Colten Ellis each getting a start. It's not ideal, but the difference between this season and last season is that the Sabres are legitimately good, so it's still worth holding onto Luukkonen just in case he performs the best and gets an extra start or two.\n\nIt was too quick to proclaim Montembeault's return as the No. 1. After a string of five games where he only lost once, Montembeault has allowed seven goals in his two most recent games, both of which were losses. The reprieve for Montembeault is that only three of the goals allowed were at even strength (though one was shorthanded), but it opens the door again for Jakub Dobes to get more playing time. Really tough schedule for the Habs in Week 17 with the Knights and Avalanche at home and then a road date in Buffalo.\n\nConsidering Adin Hill hasn't exactly been sharp since his return, Schmid still holds plenty of fantasy value as they continue to alternate starts. Long-term, Hill is still the play, but Schmid has generally been quite good this season – 15 wins in 22 starts but a pedestrian .896 SP – and will continue to win games, especially since the Knights are expected to load up ahead of the trade deadline, even after acquiring Rasmus Andersson.\n\nOlofsson scored three points in three games entering Sunday's game against the Leafs, and he has seen his ice time spike to over 20 minutes per game following a promotion to L1 and PP1 with Nathan MacKinnon. (He came skated about 18 minutes on Sunday against the Leafs). He's an excellent shooter but is prone to streaks and inconsistent play, but as long as he's in this role, there's some under-the-radar fantasy value. Olofsson provides good shot volume as long as he gets the ice time, with a pretty good conversion rate at a 13.2 shooting percentage, though he tends to be most effective on the power play.\n\nKasper's had a tough season, but his potential is evident, and that's one reason why the Wings have kept him in the lineup virtually all season. (He was scratched for one game in late December, with Mason Appleton returning from injury).\n\nThat patience seems to be paying off; Kasper has two goals and six points in his past five games, with his ice time spiking to 17:29 in a tough matchup in Minnesota. His production was bound to spike if you consider his unsustainably low 6.3 shooting percentage – he shot 13.1 percent last season – and it's always a good sign that a player has confidence when he elects to shoot on a 2-on-1 rush, as he did Saturday against the Jets.\n\nIt might take Chytil some time to find his rhythm – he narrowly missed an excellent opportunity to convert a goal in his first game back against the Devils on Friday – but still finished the game with 18:29 of ice time, eight faceoff wins, two shots and a hit. Injury risk is always a concern, but the Canucks desperately needed his presence down the middle, and he offers L2 and PP2 upside.\n\nChytil's 50-point upside and solid shooting volume – at least two shots per game – make him one of the more worthwhile gambles off the waiver wire at this point in the season, even at a pretty deep position.\n\nShayne Gostisbehere is battling a groin issue – again – which puts Walker on PP1. The Canes are hoping Gostisbehere returns before the Olympic break, but if he doesn't, Walker's fantasy value spikes with the new role. Walker obviously doesn't have as much offensive upside as Gostisbehere, and Alexander Nikishin and K'Andre Miller could both challenge for some PP1 minutes (they're on PP2 right now), but Walker can still provide a high floor with hits and blocks. In deeper leagues where defense is thin, Walker is a low-risk pickup with upside.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

Ahead of his milestone game, Bratt shared his thoughts with NJD.tv.\n\n“It’s really special.

In that sense, he's an easy guy to coach because he's all about getting better and all about helping the team.\"\n\nThis season, Bratt has appeared in 47 games, earning 36 points (11 G, 25 A). Keefe continued to highlight the left winger’s accomplishments.\n\n“From where he was drafted to how quickly he got into the league to how he found ways to be successful despite being an undersized guy to being a premier player in the league,\" Keefe said. \"Quite a story, great accomplishment for him.

    "fullText": "PHOENIX – Even though the Arizona Coyotes are currently an inactive franchise, that hasn’t stopped the massive support to bring the NHL back to the valley. That voice has echoed not just from fans, but from former players as well, such as former Coyotes defenseman Jason Demers.\n\nApr 17, 2024; Tempe, Arizona, USA; Arizona fans cheer as Josh Doan (91), Aku Raty (85) Matias Maccelli\n (63) Nick Schmaltz (8) Alexander Kerfoot (15) react following the final game as the Arizona Coyotes against the Edmonton Oilers at Mullett Arena. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhen Jason Demers speaks about Arizona hockey, it isn’t some paid campaign. It’s a former star who believes in the valley, who is protecting unfinished business. In a recent video on Instagram, the former Coyotes defenseman made a simple but powerful request: get loud, get organized, and show the NHL that Arizona still wants hockey. His call to action was directing fans to follow and support the @NHLtoArizona Instagram account, as he believes even just one platform that shows how much fans care could be the difference.\n\nApr 24, 2021; Los Angeles, California, USA; Arizona right wing Phil Kessel (81) celebrates with Arizona defenseman Jason Demers (55) center Derick Brassard (16) his goal scored against the Los Angeles Kings during the third period at Staples Center. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nModern leagues don’t just measure markets by population or arena proposals. They measure engagement by social traction, organized advocacy, and visible fan alignment. That matters now almost as much as balance sheets. Demers understands that players live inside those ecosystems. They know which buildings buzz, which cities care, and which fan bases show up even when wins don’t. Currently, Coyotes legend Shane Doan’s wife, Andrea Doan, was named in September 2025 as the chair of a new advisory panel for bringing professional hockey back to Arizona, which is surely a sign that their return could be heading in the right direction.\n\nApr 29, 2022; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Fans enter Gila River Arena prior to the game between the Coyotes and the Nashville Predators. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\nEven through instability, the Coyotes averaged thousands of unique ticket buyers, even with unstable ownership. The coyotes also helped produce one of the league’s strongest youth hockey growth rates over the last decade, in a climate that rarely has snow. That foundation didn’t vanish when the team left; it only grew passionately. Demers’ involvement adds credibility. When former players advocate publicly, it reframes the narrative. Fans respond differently when they feel invited into a movement rather than asked to relive a loss. Demers isn’t asking fans to wait quietly for the NHL’s approval. He’s urging them to participate in the process. Loud, organized demand creates leverage.\n\nWhat to expect at the 2026 Waste Management Open as hype continues to grow",

    "fullText": "Shea Theodore has hit the ground running since returning from injury, recording multiple shots and points in both games.\n\nMy Golden Knights vs. Kings predictions point to Theodore producing another strong offensive performance against a familiar Pacific Division rival tonight.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at my NHL picks for Wednesday, January 14.\n\nGolden Knights vs Kings best bet: Shea Theodore Over 1.5 shots (-150)\n\nVegas Golden Knights head coach Bruce Cassidy did not ease Shea Theodore back into the lineup, playing him 22+ minutes in each of his first two games.\n\nWhile Theodore did not post a gaudy volume, he still managed to record multiple shots in both contests — pushing his season hit rate above 70%.\n\nTheodore is well rested, having had two days off, and has consistently produced under those circumstances this season, recording multiple shots in four of five games while averaging seven attempts per night.\n\nLos Angeles has largely suppressed shots well in recent years, and Theodore has still gone Over this line in three of the past four head-to-head meetings.\n\nExpect a well-rested Theodore to fire away tonight.\n\nShea Theodore has hit the scoresheet in seven of the past eight games dating back to before his injury. He also leads the defense core in power play usage, which could come in handy against a Kings team that has allowed a power play marker in six of their last seven.\n\nMark Stone has produced with remarkable consistency this year, hitting the scoresheet in 25 of 28 games – including nine straight.\n\nTaking a look at the other blueline, Brandt Clarke has averaged 2.3 shots on 4.2 attempts over his last 10. He has generated 2.5 shots per game at home after a day of rest.\n\nMoneyline: Golden Knights -110 | Kings -110\n\nPuck Line: Golden Knights +1.5 (-280) | Kings -1.5 (+225)\n\nOver/Under: Over 5.5 | Under 5.5\n\nShea Theodore has recorded multiple shots on goal in eight of his last nine away games.

    "fullText": "Switzerland loads Olympic roster with NHL talent for Milano Cortina originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympic Winter Games fast approaching, Team Switzerland has finally announced their roster.\n\nAs is the case with other rosters, this marks the first group of NHL players to represent Switzerland at the Olympics since 2014. Team Switzerland in particular will be seeking their first Olympic medal in quite some time; they last took home the bronze in 1948. Switzerland, which is in Group A, will first open play against Team France on Feb. 12 and then play Team Canada on Feb. 13 and Team Czechia on Feb. 15.\n\nTeam Switzerland is headlined by eight league players, including Nashville Predators defenseman Roman Josi and New Jersey Devils forward and team captain Nico Hischier.\n\nThree players in total on the Switzerland roster, including the previously mentioned Hischier, are from the Devils.\n\nAlongside Hischier, right-winger Timo Meier and blueliner Jonas Siegenthaler of New Jersey have also earned a spot on Team Switzerland.\n\nFrom the Predators, captain Josi boasts a Norris Trophy among his credentials in playing at Milano Cortina.\n\nRoman Josi is back on the world stage 🇨🇭\n\nCap will compete for Team Switzerland for a second time at the upcoming Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026! pic.twitter.com/mH9mHIHgLV\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) January 7, 2026\n\nGoaltender Akira Schmid of the Vegas Golden Knights also made the cut, with Leonardo Genoni also among the three Switzerland netminders after having helped the Swedes to win silver in 2024 and 2025 at the World Championships.\n\nLos Angeles Kings forward Kevin Fiala said Team Switzerland has a leg up at this year's Winter Olympics due to how familiar the players on the roster are with one another.\n\n“Oh, I know everybody,\" Fiala said to NHL.com. \"I know everybody from [the] World Championship. Obviously, some guys I know from back in the days when we were together playing when we were young, and some guys I got to know the last few World Championships. We’re a big family, tight family. We love each other. That’s why we had success in the World Championship, and we’re going to try to do the same thing in the Olympics.”\n\nWhile Switzerland is not opening play at the Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena as favorites, the red and white will certainly receive a much needed boost due to the return of NHL talent.\n\nMORE:NHL's newest team to host Avalanche in 2027 Winter Classic",

Main Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals.  It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States. At the news conference, MLB staff assembled duffel bags with goods for foster care children.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "fullText": "The Wasatch Mountain Range of the Greater Rockies will serve as the backdrop for the 2027 NHL Winter Classic. University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium will be the site of the league's signature regular-season event, which the Utah Mammoth will host in the franchise's third season.\n\nThe Mammoth will welcome the Colorado Avalanche in a college football venue that seats approximately 51,400 on a fall Saturday in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe date of the game has yet to be finalized, but NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Mammoth owners Ryan and Ashley Smith revealed the matchup Wednesday, along with Mammoth center Logan Cooley.\n\nLogan Cooley on getting to play in the 2027 Winter Classic at Rice-Eccles Stadium: pic.twitter.com/SduTSBg5ah\n\n— Jenna Fink (@jennamfink) January 7, 2026\n\nThe Mammoth, who formed after the Arizona Coyotes were dissolved in April 2024, are currently in their second season.\n\nAfter an 8-2 start to the season, they're now 20-20-3 and in fourth place of the Central Division with 43 points.\n\nThis season, the Mammoth still have one more head-to-head meeting versus the Avalanche, who are the division leaders with a 31-4-7 record. Colorado is also atop the Western Conference at the moment with 69 points.\n\nThe Mammoth and Avalanche have met six times over the past two seasons, with Colorado holding a five-point advantage over Utah in the series. Their lone remaining matchup during the 2025-26 season is on Feb. 25 in Utah.\n\nNext season's Winter Classic will mark the Avalanche's fourth appearance in an outdoor game. Utah, on the other hand, will soon become the 32nd NHL franchise to play in an outdoor game.\n\nThe Classic started as an annual tradition on Jan. 1, 2008. At the time, the Buffalo Sabres played the Pittsburgh Penguins at what was then known as Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, home of the NFL's Buffalo Bills.\n\nThis year's Winter Classic was held Jan. 2 at the Miami Marlins' loanDepot Park. The New York Rangers defeated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers 5-1.\n\nIt was the fifth straight Classic at a baseball stadium.\n\nThat streak will end next season in Salt Lake City, where the University of Utah's campus will take center stage, as Rice-Eccles becomes the fourth college football stadium to host the event.\n\nNotably, Rice-Eccles also put on the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics. It's scheduled to fulfill the same role when the Games return to Utah in 2034.",
