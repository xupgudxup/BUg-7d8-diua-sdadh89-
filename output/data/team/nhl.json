    "fullText": "New Jersey Devils forward Jesper Bratt is set to play his 600th NHL game tonight as the Devils take on the Hurricanes.\n\nBratt made his NHL debut against the Hurricanes in October 2017. Ahead of his milestone game, Bratt shared his thoughts with NJD.tv.\n\n“It’s really special. Time goes fast,” Bratt said. “Super honored and happy to be doing it here in the same place and in front of the same fans I did my first game. It’s going to be a special time.”\n\nIn 599 NHL games, Bratt has scored 161 goals and 322 assists. Over his nine seasons with the Devils, Bratt has become a key contributor.\n\nReflecting on Bratt’s journey since being drafted in the sixth round (162nd pick), head coach Sheldon Keefe offered his perspective on the forward’s career.\n\n\"When I've been asked about him and reflect on him and what I observe is a guy that works extremely hard, is extremely focused and disciplined,\" Keefe said. \"How he prepares, how he seeks to improve, how he accepts coaching and information. In that sense, he's an easy guy to coach because he's all about getting better and all about helping the team.\"\n\nThis season, Bratt has appeared in 47 games, earning 36 points (11 G, 25 A). Keefe continued to highlight the left winger’s accomplishments.\n\n“From where he was drafted to how quickly he got into the league to how he found ways to be successful despite being an undersized guy to being a premier player in the league,\" Keefe said. \"Quite a story, great accomplishment for him. I feel like he's just getting started.\"\n\nThe puck will drop at 7 PM tonight.\n\nake sure you bookmark THN's New Jersey Devils site for THN's latest news, exclusive interviews, breakdowns, and so much more.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free. Get the latest news and trending stories by subscribing to our newsletter here. And share your thoughts by commenting below the article on THN.com or creating your own post in our community forum.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX – Even though the Arizona Coyotes are currently an inactive franchise, that hasn’t stopped the massive support to bring the NHL back to the valley. That voice has echoed not just from fans, but from former players as well, such as former Coyotes defenseman Jason Demers.\n\nApr 17, 2024; Tempe, Arizona, USA; Arizona fans cheer as Josh Doan (91), Aku Raty (85) Matias Maccelli\n (63) Nick Schmaltz (8) Alexander Kerfoot (15) react following the final game as the Arizona Coyotes against the Edmonton Oilers at Mullett Arena. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhen Jason Demers speaks about Arizona hockey, it isn’t some paid campaign. It’s a former star who believes in the valley, who is protecting unfinished business. In a recent video on Instagram, the former Coyotes defenseman made a simple but powerful request: get loud, get organized, and show the NHL that Arizona still wants hockey. His call to action was directing fans to follow and support the @NHLtoArizona Instagram account, as he believes even just one platform that shows how much fans care could be the difference.\n\nApr 24, 2021; Los Angeles, California, USA; Arizona right wing Phil Kessel (81) celebrates with Arizona defenseman Jason Demers (55) center Derick Brassard (16) his goal scored against the Los Angeles Kings during the third period at Staples Center. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nModern leagues don’t just measure markets by population or arena proposals. They measure engagement by social traction, organized advocacy, and visible fan alignment. That matters now almost as much as balance sheets. Demers understands that players live inside those ecosystems. They know which buildings buzz, which cities care, and which fan bases show up even when wins don’t. Currently, Coyotes legend Shane Doan’s wife, Andrea Doan, was named in September 2025 as the chair of a new advisory panel for bringing professional hockey back to Arizona, which is surely a sign that their return could be heading in the right direction.\n\nApr 29, 2022; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Fans enter Gila River Arena prior to the game between the Coyotes and the Nashville Predators. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\nEven through instability, the Coyotes averaged thousands of unique ticket buyers, even with unstable ownership. The coyotes also helped produce one of the league’s strongest youth hockey growth rates over the last decade, in a climate that rarely has snow. That foundation didn’t vanish when the team left; it only grew passionately. Demers’ involvement adds credibility. When former players advocate publicly, it reframes the narrative. Fans respond differently when they feel invited into a movement rather than asked to relive a loss. Demers isn’t asking fans to wait quietly for the NHL’s approval. He’s urging them to participate in the process. Loud, organized demand creates leverage.\n\nWhat to expect at the 2026 Waste Management Open as hype continues to grow",

He also leads the defense core in power play usage, which could come in handy against a Kings team that has allowed a power play marker in six of their last seven.\n\nMark Stone has produced with remarkable consistency this year, hitting the scoresheet in 25 of 28 games – including nine straight.\n\nTaking a look at the other blueline, Brandt Clarke has averaged 2.3 shots on 4.2 attempts over his last 10. He has generated 2.5 shots per game at home after a day of rest.\n\nMoneyline: Golden Knights -110 | Kings -110\n\nPuck Line: Golden Knights +1.5 (-280) | Kings -1.5 (+225)\n\nOver/Under: Over 5.5 | Under 5.5\n\nShea Theodore has recorded multiple shots on goal in eight of his last nine away games.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympic Winter Games fast approaching, Team Switzerland has finally announced their roster.\n\nAs is the case with other rosters, this marks the first group of NHL players to represent Switzerland at the Olympics since 2014. Team Switzerland in particular will be seeking their first Olympic medal in quite some time; they last took home the bronze in 1948. Switzerland, which is in Group A, will first open play against Team France on Feb. 12 and then play Team Canada on Feb. 13 and Team Czechia on Feb. 15.\n\nTeam Switzerland is headlined by eight league players, including Nashville Predators defenseman Roman Josi and New Jersey Devils forward and team captain Nico Hischier.\n\nThree players in total on the Switzerland roster, including the previously mentioned Hischier, are from the Devils.\n\nAlongside Hischier, right-winger Timo Meier and blueliner Jonas Siegenthaler of New Jersey have also earned a spot on Team Switzerland.\n\nFrom the Predators, captain Josi boasts a Norris Trophy among his credentials in playing at Milano Cortina.\n\nRoman Josi is back on the world stage 🇨🇭\n\nCap will compete for Team Switzerland for a second time at the upcoming Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026! pic.twitter.com/mH9mHIHgLV\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) January 7, 2026\n\nGoaltender Akira Schmid of the Vegas Golden Knights also made the cut, with Leonardo Genoni also among the three Switzerland netminders after having helped the Swedes to win silver in 2024 and 2025 at the World Championships.\n\nLos Angeles Kings forward Kevin Fiala said Team Switzerland has a leg up at this year's Winter Olympics due to how familiar the players on the roster are with one another.\n\n“Oh, I know everybody,\" Fiala said to NHL.com. \"I know everybody from [the] World Championship. Obviously, some guys I know from back in the days when we were together playing when we were young, and some guys I got to know the last few World Championships. We’re a big family, tight family. We love each other. That’s why we had success in the World Championship, and we’re going to try to do the same thing in the Olympics.”\n\nWhile Switzerland is not opening play at the Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena as favorites, the red and white will certainly receive a much needed boost due to the return of NHL talent.\n\nMORE:NHL's newest team to host Avalanche in 2027 Winter Classic",

Main Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States. At the news conference, MLB staff assembled duffel bags with goods for foster care children.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium will be the site of the league's signature regular-season event, which the Utah Mammoth will host in the franchise's third season.\n\nThe Mammoth will welcome the Colorado Avalanche in a college football venue that seats approximately 51,400 on a fall Saturday in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe date of the game has yet to be finalized, but NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Mammoth owners Ryan and Ashley Smith revealed the matchup Wednesday, along with Mammoth center Logan Cooley.\n\nLogan Cooley on getting to play in the 2027 Winter Classic at Rice-Eccles Stadium: pic.twitter.com/SduTSBg5ah\n\n— Jenna Fink (@jennamfink) January 7, 2026\n\nThe Mammoth, who formed after the Arizona Coyotes were dissolved in April 2024, are currently in their second season.\n\nAfter an 8-2 start to the season, they're now 20-20-3 and in fourth place of the Central Division with 43 points.\n\nThis season, the Mammoth still have one more head-to-head meeting versus the Avalanche, who are the division leaders with a 31-4-7 record. Colorado is also atop the Western Conference at the moment with 69 points.\n\nThe Mammoth and Avalanche have met six times over the past two seasons, with Colorado holding a five-point advantage over Utah in the series. Their lone remaining matchup during the 2025-26 season is on Feb. 25 in Utah.\n\nNext season's Winter Classic will mark the Avalanche's fourth appearance in an outdoor game. Utah, on the other hand, will soon become the 32nd NHL franchise to play in an outdoor game.\n\nThe Classic started as an annual tradition on Jan. 1, 2008. At the time, the Buffalo Sabres played the Pittsburgh Penguins at what was then known as Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, home of the NFL's Buffalo Bills.\n\nThis year's Winter Classic was held Jan. 2 at the Miami Marlins' loanDepot Park. The New York Rangers defeated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers 5-1.\n\nIt was the fifth straight Classic at a baseball stadium.\n\nThat streak will end next season in Salt Lake City, where the University of Utah's campus will take center stage, as Rice-Eccles becomes the fourth college football stadium to host the event.\n\nNotably, Rice-Eccles also put on the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics. It's scheduled to fulfill the same role when the Games return to Utah in 2034.",
