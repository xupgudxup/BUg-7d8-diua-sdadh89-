    "description": "The former Yankees All-Star shared a Fox News clip of Speaker Mike Johnson while accusing Democrats of trying to defund ICE.",
    "fullText": "The battle over ICE funding is getting louder with ex-Yankees All-Star Mark Teixeira blasting Democrats online\n\n“Democrats are so radical that they’re willing to shut down the government to defund ICE,” Teixeira wrote on X/Twitter, quote-tweeting a FOX news segment that ran on Sunday. “They want to tear America down, Conservatives want to build it up.\"\n\nIn the FOX News segment, House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about efforts by democrats in congress to defund ICE.\n\n“We put all of that funding into the Big Beautiful Bill, the working families tax cut, and i’m glad that we did because we had to fix the crisis that was created by the Biden Administration ... they opened the border wide, it was absolute chaos,” Johnson said in a clip shared on X/Twitter. “We allowed, by some estimates, 20 million illegal aliens to come into the country, and many of them hardened, dangerous people, criminals. We’ve got to get them out of the country. So we had to front-load the funding. That will be there as you noted. It doesn’t matter what they do to the current DHS bill, those operations will continue.”\n\nIn the current DHS funding negotiations, Democrats are attempting to “rein in” ICE by proposing significant policy reforms and budget cuts, according to Government Executive.\n\nAmong the things Democrats have pushed for, they’re calling for a $115 million reduction in enforcement, the mandatory use of body cameras and proper identification for agents.\n\nThese efforts were intensified following recent fatal shootings involving federal agents in Minneapolis, leading Senate Democrats to successfully strip the DHS funding out of a larger spending package to force further negotiations.\n\nAs Johnson noted, however, these attempts will likely have little to no impact on ICE’s actual operations because the agency is already funded the previously passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBBA).\n\nThrough that Bill, ICE received $75 billion in multi-year funding that it can use regardless of the current year’s budget outcome. Because of this existing reserve, ICE can continue its operations or several years even if Congress cuts its annual budget or if the government enters a partial shutdown.\n\nOn Aug. 28, Teixeira announced that he’d be running in Texas’s 21st Congressional District, where Rep. Chip Roy will not seek re-election as he runs for Texas Attorney General.\n\nTeixeira is a Maryland native who currently lives in the Austin area. He spent the first four-plus years of his major-league career with the Texas Rangers.\n\nThe three-time All-Star concluded his career with eight years on the Yankees, winning a World Series in 2009.\n\nTeixeira retired in 2016 after a 14-year career in which he hit .268 with a .869 OPS and 409 home runs.\n\nMets, Yankees showing interest in Gold Glove first baseman\n\nTrump unearths 36-year-old letter from George Steinbrenner: ‘You should run for president’\n\nEx-Yankees, Mets pitcher announces retirement\n\nMichael Kay exposes Yankees’ biggest problem — and it has nothing to do with their roster\n\nAre Yankees capable of beating Dodgers in 2026?

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees reportedly “checked in” on Dodgers free agent Michael Kopech this offseason, per the New York Post’s Jon Heyman.\n\nKopech entered free agency after spending a majority of 2025 on the injured list with the Dodgers. The reliever began the regular season on the injured list with a shoulder injury and transferred to the 60-day injured list at the beginning of May 2025.\n\nHe returned to the team the following month, but returned to the injured shortly after with a right knee injury. Kopech returned once again at the beginning of September, but re-aggravated his knee injury at the end of the season and missed the postseason.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Sign Brother of Current LA Starter to Minor League Deal\n\nThe right-hander joined the Dodgers at the trade deadline in 2024, switching to the National League from the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe 29-year-old made an instant impact after arriving with the Dodgers, and became one of their most important weapons out of the bullpen. He had a 1.13 ERA with L.A. in 2024, and maintained a 3.00 ERA during their World Series charge in the playoffs.\n\nEven though he struggled with injury last season, the right-hander still performed will in 2025. He had a 2.45 ERA through 14 appearances with the Dodgers last season.\n\nThe Dodgers have already reinforced their bullpen this offseason so re-signing Kopech is unlikely, but whichever team grabs him will get a high-quality reliever for the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers World Series Champion Linked to Yankees appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "Cody Bellinger re-signs, the Hall of Fame class is announced, and more.",
    "fullText": "It’s Sunday, and you know what that means — it’s time for our weekly social media roundup! For the second straight Sunday, New York City is getting hit by a wintry weather, although this time, it’s a storm expected to be so bad that many schools had already cancelled classes on Monday before the weekend even started. Now, the temperature may be chilly, but fortunately for us, the hot stove was piping hot for the Bombers this week. And since I know the anticipation is killing you, let’s get started!\n\nAll winter, the Yankees and Cody Bellinger acted like a pair of high school kids that clearly were interested in each other but were afraid to make the first move. As soon as the offseason began, Bellinger changed his Instagram profile picture, ditching a shot of him in a Yankee jersey in favor of a generic animated shot with a blank hat.\n\nThen, early last week, Bellinger and Austin Wells broke the Yankees portion of the Internet. The outfielder posted pictures of himself working out to prepare for the season, and the catcher posted a sad emoji in response. Immediately, fans began to wonder if he knew something we didn’t.\n\nThen, Wednesday afternoon, the news finally broke: the Yankees and Bellinger had agreed to a five-year deal that kept the popular outfielder in the Bronx. While Belli himself did not post on social media about the deal, he immediately changed his profile picture back to a picture of him in a Yankees uniform. Meanwhile, his wife, Chase, and mother, Jennifer, posted the following:\n\nLast night was the 101st New York Baseball Writers’ Gala, where the winner of the BBWAA’s major awards each officially received their honors. That included Aaron Judge, who took home his third career AL MVP and second in a row. Should be four! But it was a nice moment.\n\nThis week, the Baseball Hall of Fame announced its two newest members, Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones. While the two players are known more for their time with the Mets and Braves, respectively, they both did suit up for the Yankees: Jones donned the pinstripes in 2011 and 2012, while Beltrán was a part of the 2014, 2015, and 2016 teams before he was traded to the Texas Rangers. In addition to a collection of statements from key members of the organization, the Yankees made individuals posts celebrating both players.\n\nCC Sabathia, Robinson Canó, and Derek Jeter also took to social media to celebrate their former teammates, among others.\n\nFormer Yankees center fielder/current professional guitarist performed at Carnegie Hall earlier this month, and unsurprisingly, Suzyn Waldman made sure that she was in attendance.\n\nCC Sabathia posted some photos from “The Player’s Cup” this week. Honestly, I’m not 100% sure what event he is referring to — a quick Google search reveals an MLB Open, but that was an event that was supposed to occur in November — but it still seems like they all had a fun time.\n\nThe last two weeks have seen people posting photos from 2016, as they reminisce about the glory days when the Villanova Wildcats defeated the UNC in the NCAA National Championship (at least, that’s what comes to mind when I think of 2016). And naturally, now that this trend is two weeks old, we’ve got celebrities and corporate accounts joining in. First, we have Anthony Rizzo recalling one of the greatest World Series of all time, as the Cubs finally overcame their curse and proved that nothing is impossible, except maybe a Pope that roots for the Cubs.\n\nThen, the George M. Steinbrenner Field account joined in, which honestly wasn’t nearly as fun as the excitement in Chicago from the historic parade.\n\nJonathan Loáisiga had been part of the Yankees’ organization since joining them as a minor leaguer in February 2016 following a failed stint with the Giants. Injuries ravaged his career, but he was a bullpen staple in 2021 in particular, posting one of the better relief seasons you’ll see in the modern era, recording a 2.17 ERA, a 2.58 FIP, and a 1.019 WHIP across 70.2 innings. Alas, those aforementioned injuries were a constant issue for him, and he and the Yankees finally went their separate ways, making it official when Loáisiga signed a minor-league deal with the Diamondbacks earlier this month.\n\nLoáisiga took to Instagram to thank both the Yankees and their fans, in both Spanish and English. Best of luck to him in Arizona!\n\nAnd so, let’s wrap up this weekend’s social media roundup with a nice shot of last weekend’s snow, courtesy of Suzyn Waldman.",

    "description": "The Yankees’ slugging catcher hit free agency after a superb 2007, and they had to outbid the Mets to keep him around.",
    "fullText": "When a standout player who has been with your organization his entire career wants to stay with you, you listen. That’s what Yankees general manager Brian Cashman did when Jorge Posada became a free agent after the 2007 campaign.\n\nA five-time All-Star and switch-hitting Silver Slugger, Posada would’ve been a boon for any team on the market. He still stands as one of the best-hitting catchers of the past 50 years, and his bat was elite in 2007. The Yankees had been able to extend him during the 2001-02 offseason for five years and $51 million with club option, but despite expressing interest in staying with the team he had been with his whole career, there was also major interest from the crosstown New York Mets — making the chase for the decorated, switch-hitting backstop all the more interesting.\n\nThe Yankees ended up making the deal, paying Posada the most average annual salary for a catcher at the time—$13.1 million—and thus stopped a rival team from compelling him to remain in the City, in a different borough. Although the final result being a positive one for the Yankees, it certainly wasn’t without its fireworks.\n\nJorge Posada\nSigning Date: November 13, 2007\nContract: Four years, $52.4 million\n\nPosada was already an established star by this the fall of 2007, and it had been a remarkable ascent from near-complete anonymity during the early part of the 1990s. We chronicled his history in greater detail during our Top 100 Yankees series, but we’ll present a shorter version. The Santurce, Puerto Rico native starred in high school and was able to cut his teeth some more at Calhoun Community College in Decatur, AL. He landed on the Yankees’ radar, and after a couple draft attempts, they signed him out of the 24th round in the 1990 edition — two rounds behind the Yanks’ selection of a young high school lefty from Texas named Andy Pettitte.\n\nOriginally a second baseman, Posada was convinced to give catching a try in 1991, when he made 11 appearances behind the plate for short-season Oneonta. By the next year, he was a full-time backstop, and over the next couple seasons, he shot up through the minor leagues, playing 92 games with the Triple-A Columbus Clippers in 1994 and officially debuting with the Yankees in September of ’95. Blocked at the big-league level across ’95 and ’96 by Mike Stanley, Jim Leyritz, and Joe Girardi, Posada played just nine games in The Show during that span, and only traveled with the team as they won it all in October 1996. But even though he would never be confused for a defensive stalwart at catcher, his time would soon come.\n\nPrior to the start of ’97, the Yankees traded Leyritz to the Angels despite his World Series heroics. They wanted to open the door for Posada to get big-league reps as Girardi’s backup and were confident that the up-and-comer could earn his keep. Following a 101 OPS+ in 60 games of action in ’97 though, the Yankees did float Posada as a possible trade option with the Montreal Expos for Cy Young Award winner Pedro Martinez. That obviously did not work out, as Pedro was traded to the rival Boston Red Sox, and the next handful of years would live in infamy between those two teams (and the two players in particular).\n\nPosada finally started over 100 games in the record-breaking ’98 season for the Yankees, slashing .268/.350/.475 with 17 homers for an OPS+ of 115, and his numbers only continued to climb from there. He was eventually trusted with the everyday job as Girardi aged out of the role and departed in December of ’99. The 2000 campaign was the first where Posada really shined, making his first All-Star team and hitting .287/.417/.527 with 28 homers and a 139 OPS+, earning his first Silver Slugger as well.\n\nIt was an important time for Posada to make his mark, as other members of the Yankees’ core like Paul O’Neill and Tino Martinez were nearing the ends of their days in pinstripes. And thanks in part to Posada’s tenacious at-bat against a dominant Al Leiter with two outs in the ninth inning of 2000 World Series Game 5, the Yankees rallied to secure the three-peat, Posada scoring the go-ahead run on Luis Sojo’s single.\n\nAlthough it would be a few years before the Yankees again won it all, Posada was an essential part of the contending operation alongside pal Derek Jeter (the best man in his wedding). Posada earned four consecutive All-Star nods and Silver Sluggers from 2000-03, and he really shined in the last of those years. He became the first Yankees catcher to hit 30 homers in a season since no less than Yogi Berra, and thanks in part to a 144 OPS+ and 5.9 rWAR in 142 games, he finished third for AL MVP, trailing only Alex Rodriguez and Carlos Delgado. And while his 2004-06 seasons weren’t as decorated, he still played a vital role, remaining a pillar of health with 422 games started out of the possible 486, notching a 121 OPS+.\n\nEntering 2007, Posada had one year left on his deal before he would hit free agency, and in spring training, the Yankees were uninterested in opening up talks on a second extension. He timed his best campaign since ’03 quite well, and his bat would’ve received even more attention had A-Rod not turned in an MVP season for the ages. Posada finished sixth in the voting with career-highs in all the rate stats, batting .338/.426/.543 with a 153 OPS+ and 5.4 rWAR to claim his fifth All-Star selection and Silver Slugger. That made him a valuable commodity for teams, despite approaching his late thirties at the most physically demanding position in the sport.\n\nThe Yankees fell to Cleveland in the ALDS that October, and a decision was on the horizon for Posada. He really wanted a four-year deal in wake of that superb season. The Yankees weren’t particularly enthused about handing that long a commitment to a catcher who had just turned 37 that August; they were hoping to get Posada on a three-year contract for around $40 million.\n\nSo Posada was willing to hear out some of his other options, especially since A-Rod had opted out and longtime manager Torre was on his way to the Dodgers. Most notably, the folks across town were very interested. The 2007 season had ended in disaster for the Mets, and catcher Paul Lo Duca took a serious dip after leading the NL East champs in 2006. He was a free agent as well, but GM Omar Minaya had his eyes on Posada, as did his former third-base coach, Mets manager Willie Randolph.\n\nAs such, it was easy for Posada to not-so-subtly get the Yankees’ full attention by meeting with the Mets the day before other clubs could officially submut offers, per the New York Times:\n\nPosada and his agents, Sam and Seth Levinson, had lunch Monday with Minaya and [Mets] vice president Tony Bernazard. The Yankees initially offered the 36-year-old Posada a three-year contract but upped their proposal to four years on Monday evening.\n\nWhile Posada briefly played hard to get for the Yankees, his intentions were clear from the start. He felt it would be easier to stay with the team that he had been with since his mid-twenties, and that’s exactly what happened. The Yankees acquiesced to his request and ultimately signed him to a four-year, $52.4 million deal.\n\nIn those final four seasons, Posada played in 397 games and slashed .258/.349/.454 for an above-average OPS+ of 110. A shoulder injury curtailed both his and the Yankees’ hopes for 2008 success under his old teammate-turned-skipper Girardi, but in 2009, it all came together. Posada hit 22 homers in 438 PA, good for an .885 OPS and 125 OPS+, and he had a productive October as well. Jeter might’ve been the captain, but Posada unofficially led the clubhouse and was willing to be the guy who held teammates accountable when necessary.\n\nThe Bombers won it all, and Posada had his fifth ring. It would be the last one.\n\nPosada’s bat remained strong in 2010 but his oft-uneven defense had made him a liability behind the plate, and he was a concussion risk as well. The Yankees found a bargain in the more well-balanced Russell Martin that offseason, so they signed him and planned to have Posada DH in 2011. The 40-year-old was unhappy in the role and dipped to a below-average showing at the plate, too. Although it was an awkward swan song for Posada, the hard feelings faded in time (and he was actually one of the few consistent bats during their five-game ALDS loss to Detroit). He retired in January 2012 and the Yankees retired his No. 20 in August 2015, honoring him with a plaque in Monument Park.\n\nSo yes, the Yankees had reason to be uneasy about that fourth year. But the overall contract still led to a 2009 World Series crown and the Yankees were able to pivot to a new catcher anyway during that last season. Losing Posada to the Mets would’ve been a true shame; thankfully, they didn’t let it happen.\n\nSee more of the “50 Most Notable Yankees Free Agent Signings in 50 Years” series here.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees managed to hold on to their top-rated prospects in the trade for left-hander Ryan Weathers from the Miami Marlins.\n\nFour of the Yankees' highly regarded farmhands were named to Baseball America's top 100 prospects list for 2026. They are: shortstop George Lombard Jr. (No. 46), right-hander Elmer Rodriguez (No. 59), shortstop Dax Kilby (No. 61), and right-hander Carlos Lagrange (No. 93).\n\nLombard, 20, played 108 games in Double-A last season, hitting eight home runs with a .695 OPS. Kilby, 19, was a first-round draft choice in 2025 and had an .898 OPS and 16 steals in 18 games at Single-A Tampa.\n\nBaseball America named Rodriguez the Yankees' Minor League Pitcher of the Year this past season, leading the farm system with 176 strikeouts. Lagrange can hit over 100 mph with his fastball, making him a possible Major League bullpen option in 2026.\n\nDespite being the most ready of the five players to make an impact in the Majors, outfielder Spencer Jones did not appear on Baseball America's top 100 list.\n\nThere are legitimate concerns with Jones' swing and miss and strikeout rate against MLB arms. He hit 35 home runs between Double-A Somerset and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre but struck out 179 times in 506 plate appearances.\n\nIf Cody Bellingers signs elsewhere, Jones' chance of making the Yankees' Opening Day roster and splitting left field duties with Jasson Dominguez increases.\n\nMets offer to Kyle Tucker before Dodgers' $240 million deal revealed by former MLB GM\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nKyle Tucker contract details: How much deferred money did Dodgers give new star?\n\nDodgers continue to frustrate all of MLB with major Kyle Tucker signing\n\nRed Sox get big trade update on Brendan Donovan amid updated rumors\n\nFormer Cubs, Twins All-Star utilityman to sign with Rockies on two-year deal",

    "description": "A pair of former Yankees outfielders are heading to Cooperstown.",
    "fullText": "There are two new members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and both of them are ex-Yankees. On Tuesday night, the BBWAA released the results of this year’s Hall of Fame ballot: Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected as part of the class of 2026. The pair will be enshrined in Cooperstown alongside Eras Committee pick Jeff Kent on July 26th.\n\nThe pair were born just one day apart in April of 1977 and have now been elected to the Hall of Fame on the same day. Only two center fielders had been elected to Cooperstown in the last 45 years, so to induct a pair in on the same day is a relative bonanza.\n\nBeltrán topped balloting in this cycle, receiving 84.2 percent of the vote in his fourth year on the ballot. It’s a jump of almost 13 percentage points from last year, when Beltrán narrowly missed out on election.\n\nBeltrán played 20 seasons in the big leagues with the Royals, Astros, Mets, Giants, Cardinals, Yankees, and Rangers, slashing .279/.350/.486 with 435 home runs, 1,587 RBIs, 312 stolen bases, a 118 wRC+, and 67.4 fWAR. He was a nine-time All-Star, three-time Gold Glover, two-time Silver Slugger, the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year, and the 2013 Roberto Clemente Award winner. He hit the fourth-most home runs of any switch-hitter in league history behind only Mickey Mantle, Eddie Murray, and Chipper Jones, and is one of only eight players in MLB history with at least 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases alongside Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds, Andre Dawson, Barry Bonds, Steve Finley, Reggie Sanders, and Alex Rodriguez.\n\nBeltrán played two-and-a-half seasons for the Yankees in his late-thirties and was one of their more productive hitters upon signing with them in the mid-2010s before being traded to the Rangers for a trio of prospects at the 2016 Trade Deadline. He would go on to win his lone World Series ring a year later with the Astros (dispatching his old teammates in a seven-game ALCS), but was named as one of the architects of their 2017 sign-stealing scandal, which was one of the principal factors in not being elected to the Hall in his first three years of eligibility. Nonetheless, Beltrán becomes the sixth player from Puerto Rico to be elected to Cooperstown.\n\nJones sneaks in with 78.4 percent of the vote, representing just over a 12 percentage point increase from his vote share last year. It was Jones’ ninth year on the ballot, his penultimate year of eligibility.\n\nJones becomes the first player born in Curaçao to be elected to the Hall of Fame. He was considered one of the all-time great defensive center fielders in MLB history, his 126.4 UZR ranking him second all-time behind Ichiro Suzuki and his 150 total zone runs ranking him fifth all-time behind Clemente, Mays, Barry Bonds, and Jesse Barfield. He blended that defense with prodigious power — he is one of only four players in history with at least 10 Gold Gloves and 400 home runs, joining Mays, Ken Griffey Jr., and Mike Schmidt.\n\nIn his 17 big league seasons, Jones played for the Braves, Dodgers, Rangers, White Sox, and Yankees, making five All-Star appearances. He slashed .254/.337/.486 with 434 home runs, 1,289 RBIs, 152 stolen bases, a 111 wRC+ and 67 fWAR. His career is bookended by encounters with the Yankees. As a rookie in 1996, he became the youngest player in MLB history to homer in the World Series at just 19 years old, breaking the record set by Mickey Mantle when he hit home runs in his first two at-bats of Game 1 of the 1996 World Series. He played the final two seasons of his big league career with the Yankees in 2011 and 2012 before a two-season swan song in Japan with the NPB’s Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, where he was teammates with future Yankees ace Masahiro Tanaka.\n\nAndy Pettitte experienced one of the biggest jumps in vote share, going from 27.9-percent of the vote last year to 48.5-percent of the vote in this cycle. It’s an encouraging sign for Pettitte in his eighth year on the ballot — if he can experience similar jumps in his final two years of eligibility there is a real chance he could be elected. There will always be questions of the effect his admission to using HGH will have on future voting, but the all-time postseason wins leader is certainly trending in the right direction.\n\nAs for other former Yankees on the ballot, Alex Rodriguez remained relatively stagnant, going from 37.1-percent of the vote last year to 40-percent in this, his fifth year of eligibility. Bobby Abreu experienced a nice jump from 19.5-percent last year to 30.8-percent this year, but with only three more years on the ballot, he will need to be handed even bigger boosts in future voting cycles to have a shot. Edwin Encarnación received just six votes (1.4-percent) in his first year on the ballot and will therefore fall off the ballot as he comes up short of the five-percent threshold needed to maintain eligibility.\n\nCongratulations again to Beltrán and Jones on this fantastic achievement. The full voting can be found below.",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees are entering the final phase of Aaron Judge’s prime, but their front office isn’t acting like it this offseason.\n\nNew York’s ongoing talks with Cody Bellinger (who might land elsewhere) are happening within the context of a painfully underwhelming offseason for Yankees fans.\n\nFirst, the Yankees were blindsided by Trent Grisham accepting his qualifying offer. Their acquisitions and retentions since then have been marginal at best: Amed Rosario, Ryan Yarbrough, Paul Blackburn, and Ryan Weathers.\n\nWhile the Baltimore Orioles have been killing it this offseason, and with the Toronto Blue Jays making some big moves as well, the Yankees look ridiculous with how inactive they’ve been. The Boston Red Sox were more or less quiet for awhile, but even their offseason has been miles better than New York’s, especially now that they’ve added Ranger Suárez.\n\nBleacher Report’s Zachary D. Rymer recently wrote an article talking about the MLB teams who have had the worst offseason, and the Yankees were at the top of his list.\n\n“(The Yankees) seem to be treating their offseason shopping as an optional exercise,” Rymer wrote on Wednesday. “Even bringing back Cody Bellinger, which should be a lay-up, is proving difficult.\n\n… These are the Yankees we’re talking about. No move is supposed to be too big, so no fan should be forgiving of how they’ve made only small moves so far.”\n\n“The Yankees actually project as the fourth-best team in MLB this year, but those projections are taking a lot on faith with question marks like Anthony Volpe, Austin Wells and even Giancarlo Stanton,” Rymer continued. “In other words, the last thing the Yankees should be thinking is that they can leave good enough alone.”\n\nTwo AL East Teams Reportedly Still In On Framber Valdez",

    "fullText": "When the New York Mets signed Bo Bichette on Friday to a three-year, $126 million deal, many MLB fans (particularly those rooting for the New York Yankees) assumed that the Mets halt their pursuit of Cody Bellinger.\n\nThat’s not what’s happening, according to New York Mets On SI’s Pat Ragazzo.\n\n“The Mets are still in play for free agent first baseman/outfielder Cody Bellinger, as sources told Mets On SI on Friday,” Ragazzo wrote.\n\n“The versatile Bellinger fits the Mets at multiple positions given his above average defense at first base and in center and left field. Bellinger’s left-handed bat would also provide added protection in the Mets’ lineup for Francisco Lindor, Juan Soto and Bichette. Bellinger also has a .929 career OPS at Citi Field in 20 games.”\n\n“The Mets could plug Bellinger in center or left field, or at first base if they aren’t comfortable playing Jorge Polanco and Brett Baty at the position,” Ragazzo added.\n\nBellinger has carved out a dynamic nine-year MLB career marked by peaks and valleys. Debuting with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017, he earned Rookie of the Year honors with 39 home runs. His 2019 MVP season saw him smash 47 homers while batting .305, followed by a 2020 World Series title. Injuries hampered him in 2021-22, leading to a non-tender and a rebound with the Chicago Cubs in 2023 (.307 average, 26 homers). In 2024, he hit .266 with 18 long balls before opting out of his deal.\n\nBellinger’s 2025 campaign with the Yankees represented a strong resurgence, batting .272 with 29 home runs, 98 RBIs, and 13 stolen bases in 152 games. He posted an .813 OPS, 125 wRC+, and delivered memorable moments like a three-homer game against the Cubs, aiding the Yankees’ playoff push.\n\nBellinger remains a free agent, with ongoing talks stalled over contract length (he seeks seven years, while New York offers five at $155-160 million).\n\nBo Bichette Signing Creates Perfect Trade Fit For Red Sox",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees' rotation for the 2026 season isn't at its full strength at the start of the year. But, even with a few stars, like Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodon, and Clarke Schmidt potentially sitting out for part of the 2026 season, the rotation is in a good place.\n\nThings got even better when they, according to Craig Mish of Sports Grid, traded four prospects to the Miami Marlins for starter Ryan Weathers.\n\nThe new lefty starter joins the rotation, making the Yankees' projected rotation for 2026 a strong one regardless of the injuries to Cole, Rodon, and Schmidt.\n\n1. Max Fried, LHP\n2. Cam Schlittler, RHP\n3. Will Warren, RHP\n4. Ryan Weathers, LHP\n5. Luis Gil, RHP\n\nThis projected rotation is likely what the Yankees begin the 2026 season with. There could be some change in the order, but this would allow the Yankees to break up their left-handers and right-handers, while putting Fried and Schlittler atop the rotation.\n\nIt's far from ideal, and isn't a World Series-caliber rotation. But, with the return of Cole and Rodon, along with Schmidt and the potential for other starters to emerge through Spring Training, the rotation is overall in a good spot.\n\nOnce Cole and Rodon return, the new-look rotation would be a whole lot better. Fried, Cole, and Schlittler would likely be the main trio, with Warren and Rodon rounding out the five-man rotation.\n\nThat would allow for Weathers, who's started at most 16 games in a season in his career, to take a back-seat as either a sixth man or potentially as a long reliever. The same could happen with Gil.\n\nMore: Yankees get $160 million contract update on Cody Bellinger amid stare-down\n\nOr, if the Yankees wanted to, thanks to the Weathers trade, once Rodon, Schmidt, and Cole are back, they could explore a trade or two with their depth starters this upcoming season.\n\nGil, Warren, or Schmidt might field decent trade interest, allowing the Yankees to upgrade at a position of need if one comes about during the regular season.\n\nWeathers will help keep the Yankees' rotation afloat to begin the year as one of the back-end arms, but once the three injured starters come back, and assuming there aren't any other injuries, then Weathers will be incredible insurance for the rotation.\n\nThe Yankees' projected rotation looks a lot better now that Weathers is on the team, as the five-man rotation to begin the season won't be in as bad a place if none of the three injured starters can go by Opening Day.\n\nMets know what contract they need to give to sign Cody Bellinger\n\nPhillies get bad news on Bo Bichette amid unexpected challenge from Alex Bregman Cubs deal\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nRed Sox linked to frustrating Alex Bregman replacements after Cubs deal\n\nDodgers predicted to poach $189M Silver Slugger, All-Star from Phillies to solve aging dilemma\n\nMets get Kyle Tucker news in free agency\n\nTeam USA World Baseball Classic roster: Bryce Harper, Tarik Skubal among stars on team for 2026 tournament",

    "description": "The Yankees will send four position player prospects to Miami to add to their possible rotation.",
    "fullText": "It’s been 97 days since the Yankees were eliminated in Game 4 of the ALDS by the eventual pennant-winning Toronto Blue Jays. While the Yankees have done some minor housekeeping in the offseason, they have yet to add an external player who isn’t a waiver claim, on a minor-league deal, or dealing with Rule 5 shenanigans. That changed, however, on Tuesday night.\n\nPer the YES Network’s Jack Curry, the Yankees are acquiring left-handed pitcher Ryan Weathers from the Miami Marlins in exchange for four prospects. Marlins reporter Craig Mish was first on the four prospects being moved: outfielders Dillon Lewis and Brendan Jones, and infielders Dylan Jasso and Juan Matheus.\n\nIn exchange for Weathers, the Yankees parted with Dillon Lewis, Brendan Jones, Dylan Jasso and Juan Matheus. @CraigMish was on it with the minor leaguers involved in the deal.\n\n— JackCurryYES (@JackCurryYES) January 14, 2026\n\nWeathers is a former No. 7 overall pick by the Padres back in 2018 out of Loretto High School in Tennessee. After a solid full-season in A-ball in 2019 a rare playoff MLB debut during the COVID 2020 season, he made the Padres’ Opening Day roster in 2021. He had skipped the top three levels of the minor leagues and ended up throwing 94.2 innings across 30 appearances (18 starts), struggling to a 5.32 ERA. After realizing they rushed one of their top prospects, the Padres sent him back to Triple-A in 2022, where he spent nearly the entire season aside from one MLB spot start in May. Weathers struggled again in the majors in 2023 before being shipped to Miami for former Yankees first baseman Garrett Cooper at the 2023 Trade Deadline.\n\nEntering the 2024 season, Weathers’ luster had gone away with a 5.88 ERA in 156 innings in his career, but he found something in Miami. His fastball velocity steadily increased, going from 95.1 in 2023 to 96.8 in 2025, and his approach was refined to throw fewer four-seamers and more sinkers. It’s allowed him to throw 125 innings of sub-4 ERA ball with a 4.26 FIP, and an improved strikeout-to-walk ratio (15.2 K-BB%).\n\nThe hang-up since Weathers has been in Miami, however, is injuries. He missed three months with an index finger strain in 2024 and missed time with both a forearm and lat strain in 2025, limiting him to a total of 24 starts in two seasons.\n\nThere’s potential for Weathers to work out of the bullpen (like his right-handed father David, a 1996 World Series champion with the Yanks), but he currently figures to be part of a rotation that Brian Cashman has been scrambling to find upgrades to. With Max Fried, Cam Schlittler, Luis Gil, and Will Warren currently penciled into the Opening Day rotation with Gerrit Cole, Clarke Schmidt, and Carlos Rodón due to miss the start of the season, Weathers likely slides Ryan Yarbrough into the bullpen — assuming no other moves are made. What happens when the calvary returns will depend on how he fares, and who happens to be healthy at the time. The rotation insurance is key.\n\nWeathers will make $1.35 million in 2026 and has two further years of arbitration remaining, becoming a free agent after the 2028 campaign. He also has a minor-league option remaining, giving the Yankees valuable flexibility in case of a roster crunch.\n\nAs for the prospects heading to Miami, MLB Pipeline ranks Jones and Lewis as the Yankees’ No. 15 and No. 16 prospects, as well as Jasso at No. 23. Jones stole 51 bases across High-A and Double-A in 2025 while boasting a .359 OBP. Lewis went 20/20 at High-A Hudson Valley in 2025. Both were selected in the back-half of the team’s 2024 draft, and Baseball America was even a little higher on Lewis, ranking him eighth in the organization.\n\nJasso was an undrafted free agent out of New Mexico Junior College in 2023 and had been a consistent presence for Double-A Somerset for the past year and a half. He made BA’s Top 30, while Matheus was on the outside looking in; the latter hit .275 with 40 stolen bases in A-ball in 2025.\n\nWe’ll have more to come, but in the meantime, welcome a second Weathers to New York!",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew York Yankees fans are patiently waiting. Awaiting the first big move of general manager Brian Cashman's offseason.\n\nWhile the Yankees continue to wait on outfielder Cody Bellinger's decision, they could shift their focus to the trade market. One of the starters New York has interest in is Freddy Peralta from the Milwaukee Brewers, who finished fifth in the NL Cy Young voting last season.\n\nThe Brewers owe the 29-year-old $8 million for the 2026 season before he reaches free agency. A cheap salary for a player of Peralta's caliber. The Yankees could make a strong offer to the Brewers for Peralta if they are willing to offload some of their minor league depth.\n\nIt takes two sides to tango, but the Yankees have a handful of minor league arms who could pique the interest of the Brewers.\n\n\"The Yankees are well-positioned to meet Milwaukee’s demands for a Peralta replacement because of their pitching depth in the majors and the upper levels of the minors,\" The Athletic's Chris Kirschner wrote Monday.\n\n\"[Cam] Schlittler should be off-limits in a trade for Peralta,\" Kirschner added later in his article. \"[Will] Warren or Luis Gil should be available in a possible deal.\"\n\nThere are concerns with Gil's health and command, but he was the AL Rookie of the Year in 2024. Warren has five years of control and led all rookie pitchers with 171 strikeouts last season. Kirschner added pitching prospects Carlos Lagrange and Elmer Rodriguez as two possibilities in a trade for Peralta.\n\nThe time for the Yankees to be aggressive is now.

    "description": "The New York Yankees are apparently pursuing Kyle Tucker, but they just received some bad news in that department.",
    "fullText": "The New York Yankees have reportedly moved away from Cody Bellinger and have pivoted to other options in MLB free agency. One of those options? Kyle Tucker.\n\nTucker is the jewel of this year's free-agent class and was viewed as a potential fit for the Yankees heading into the winter, but it didn't appear that New York had much interest in the four-time All-Star.\n\nHowever, recent events may have changed things for the Bronx Bombers, as Bellinger seems to be asking for $36-37 million annually, a rather steep price for a merely good — not great — 30-year-old player with an injury history.\n\nAs a result, the Yankees have evidently decided to turn their attention to Tucker, who was said to be seeking a $400 million contract at the outset of he offseason, but may have reduced his demands as a result of a slow market.\n\nBut unfortunately, it does not appear that New York is one of the favorites to sign him.\n\nFormer MLB general manager Jim Duquette has revealed that the Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets are the three teams most connected to Tucker and have all met with the outfielder either in person or via video call.\n\nDuquette wondered if any one of those three ballclubs would \"increase\" their offers, indicating that each of those teams have already made overtures to Tucker.\n\nSo, where do the Yankees fit in all of this? Have they made Tucker an offer? Are they laying in the weeds? Are they really not that interested in the former Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs star?\n\nIt's also entirely possible that Alex Bregman's recent five-year, $175 million contract with the Cubs has rejuvenated Tucker's market and, therefore, his asking price, which may have caused the Yanks to bow out of the process.\n\nNew York has not made a single notable addition this winter. The Yankees are supposedly trying to make a trade for a starting pitcher, but things appear to be moving at a snail's pace on that front.\n\nAs far as signing big-name free agents? Outside of Bellinger, New York has not seemed serious about anyone. It was also linked to Bo Bichette, but it seems hard to imagine the Yanks meeting his asking price, especially considering how bad he is defensively.\n\nIf the Yankees really want Tucker, they better jump in now, because all three of the teams mentioned have deep pockets and are clearly not afraid to spend.",

He impacts the game on both sides of the baseball, can really swing it, and fits most lineups.\n\nFor the Yankees, he’d provide another middle-of-the-order presence with Aaron Judge. For the Mets, he’d represent another franchise bat to pair with Juan Soto.\n\nBoth New York teams have shown a willingness to spend, and both could use a player of his caliber after disappointing years a season ago.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman, both squads have checked in on the left-handed hitting slugger.\n\n“Though he might not reach the early $400M predictions after his typically excellent but ultimately unsatisfying platform season with the Cubs, the all-around star (he, Mookie Betts, Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and José Ramírez are the only players to post a 4 WAR the past five seasons) should still be worth $300M-plus based on past deals and comps.

    "fullText": "MLB.com | Brian Murphy: Tatsuya Imai, the top NPB player on the free agent market, is reportedly meeting with teams in Los Angeles ahead of his Friday afternoon deadline to sign. It’s unclear whether the Yankees are among those teams meeting in-person with Imai, though reports still link them, along with the Phillies and White Sox, to the right-hander. Imai, just 27-years-old, posted a 1.92 ERA over 163.2 innings in NPB last season, and may command a nine-figure guarantee.\n\nNew York Daily News | Peter Sblendorio: Now that the first quarter of the 21st century is in the books, the Daily News picked their All-Century New York team, selecting the best player from the last 25 years for each of New York’s teams. The top Yankee? None other than Aaron Judge. Judge had to beat out Derek Jeter, who won two World Series and racked up over 2,600 hits in the 2000’s, Alex Rodriguez, who won two MVP’s as a Yankee in the 21st century, and many other greats, but it’s clear that Judge’s resume has no peer. There are some debates with the other NY teams as well; Jalen Brunson, who’s played just 3.5 seasons in New York, is the Knicks’ All-Century selection, while Michael Strahan gets the nod over Eli Manning for the Giants.\n\nMLB.com | Sarah Langs: To close out 2025, the great Sarah Langs highlighted at least one amazing stat for each team from last season. For the Yankees, it of course came from Aaron Judge. Judge led MLB in batting average, OBP, and slugging percentage, the triple-slash triple crown, becoming just the fifth man in the expansion era to do so. He also set a record with 20 first-inning home runs.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf the New York Yankees are serious about landing another ace-caliber arm, Hunter Greene is the type of guy who fits exactly what they’d be looking for. He’s 26 years old, has elite stuff, and is under team control until 2029.\n\nHowever, that’s why prying him from the Cincinnati Reds wouldn’t be cheap.\n\nCincinnati has no reason to move Greene unless the return is incredible. He isn’t a rental, and he isn’t anything short of a star. He’s a prime-aged arm the Reds can build around, so any trade conversation would start with the Yankees giving up multiple top prospects.\n\nSB Nation proposed a trade that shows just how high the price would be.\n\nIn the pitch, the Yankees would send George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodriguez as the headliners, along with two additional prospects, likely from their upper-level pitching group. The Yankees' upper-level pitching is as good as any in baseball.\n\n“Given his age (26), ability, and contract terms, it’s difficult to find a good comp for the type of package it would take to pry him from Cincy. The Red Sox’s trades for Chris Sale and Garrett Crochet are fairly decent, the Astros’ acquisition of Gerrit Cole and Orioles’ move for Corbin Burnes less so.\n\n“At a minimum, it looks like the Reds could demand a pair of consensus top-100 prospects plus at least another pair less-heralded youngsters. It’s not a stretch to imagine the Reds demanding George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodríguez in addition to several of the impressive crop of upper level pitching prospects,” Peter Brody wrote.\n\nPerhaps the Yankees will want to add a bat with those prospects instead of a pitcher, but having another arm like Greene is never a bad idea.\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed\n\nESPN trade rumor has Yankees acquiring two veteran stars from Twins\n\nYankees urged to swap Jasson Dominguez to Marlins for 6'5'' ace",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees continue to be the favorites for Cody Bellinger, especially as the offseason market develops the way we’ve seen it.\n\nBellinger hasn’t moved quickly, and that’s probably because of Kyle Tucker not signing yet. The market has been a bit hotter recently, but it’s still relatively slow.\n\nNew York has familiarity with Bellinger, a need for an outfielder/first baseman, and should have more than enough to pay him.\n\nAlexander Wilson of Empire Sports believes those reasons will ultimately lead Bellinger back to the Bronx. Wilson predicted Bellinger would sign a five-year, $170 million deal with the Yankees once the market settles.\n\n“Right now, Bellinger’s camp is asking for the moon and stars, trying to leverage his name value into a contract that simply doesn’t exist in this sinking market,” Wilson wrote.\n\n“However, reality is setting in, and I predict he will settle for a five-year, $170 million deal once he realizes the Yankees are the only team offering both the money and the familiarity he’s looking for. This aligns with the front office’s broader strategy, which involves the complex Yankees architecture of signing two Boras clients in the same offseason.”\n\nSome have said Bellinger wants big-time money, which he deserves.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOnce the New York Yankees feel comfortable with how the lineup looks, the next move feels obvious. The rotation still needs help.\n\nNew York has enough arms to get through the regular season, but that’s not really the idea here. Injuries are already part of the conversation with Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodon, and there isn’t much if they were to be hurt.\n\nSure, the Yankees' staff is decent, but it needs to stay healthy.\n\nSigning depth helps, but it doesn’t change that reality.\n\nIf the Yankees decide to be aggressive, it’s likely going to be via trade rather than another short-term signing. They’ve shown a willingness to deal from prospect depth when the fit makes sense, and I’d expect that to be the case again this winter.\n\nThat’s where Freddy Peralta comes into play. The Milwaukee Brewers right-hander is under control, elite, and capable of handling a significant workload.\n\nHe’s the type of starter who would change things for New York.\n\nAlexander Wilson of Empire Sports predicted the Yankees will pivot in that direction once the lineup is settled and sign Peralta.\n\n“Once the lineup is secured, I expect Cashman to aggressively pivot to the rotation by targeting Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta. The Yankees and Brewers already have a well-oiled trade pipeline, established last winter when New York sent Nestor Cortes and Caleb Durbin to Milwaukee for Devin Williams.\n\n“While the recent move where the Yankees re-sign Paul Blackburn to a one-year, $2 million contract provides depth, it does not move the needle for a team trying to win a World Series. Peralta is the legitimate frontline hammer that helps protect a unit already dealing with major injury questions,” he wrote.\n\nIf the Yankees make a move, it’s hard to see it being for another depth arm.

    "fullText": "Beyond some recycled gifts, the Yankees moved into the holidays without delivering any big presents to their eager fan base.\n\nAnd outside of wanting to reunite with free agent Cody Bellinger, who is a fit for several contenders, the Yankees’ winter plan has been to marginally upgrade areas of need without spending a great deal.\n\nThat syncs with owner Hal Steinbrenner’s “ideal’’ of a payroll below the final luxury tax threshold, and GM Brian Cashman’s thoughts about the current club.\n\n“Don’t misinterpret that as saying I don’t recognize that there’s areas of weakness on this roster that we have to improve upon,\" Cashman said earlier this month. “It’s just not as prevalent as last year where we really had to do a lot of different things on the run.\n\nTrent Grisham, CF: Accepted the one-year, $22.025 million free agent qualifying offer extended by the Yankees.\n\nTim Hill, LHP: Setup reliever had his $3 million option for 2026 triggered by the team.\n\nAmed Rosario, IF: Signed to a guaranteed, one-year, $2.5 million free agent contract.\n\nPaul Blackburn, RHP: Agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract that could earn him another $500,000 in performance bonuses, as first reported by the New York Post.\n\nRyan Yarbrough, LHP: Returned on a one-year, $2.5 million free agent contract in mid-November.\n\nAn expensive runback with Grisham at least provides cover in center field if Bellinger signs elsewhere.\n\nThat leaves Jasson Dominguez as the leading left field candidate and puts lefty-slugging prospect Spencer Jones in play for a potentially significant role in 2026.\n\nRosario provides a righty-hitting platoon for third baseman Ryan McMahon, but the Yanks still seek a right-handed hitting outfield presence.\n\nYarbrough and Blackburn bolster a staff that needs flexible, veteran starting options that can collapse into relief roles once the rehabbing Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodon and Clarke Schmidt return.\n\nCade Winquest, RHP: Hard-throwing reliever became the Yankees' first Rule 5 selection in 14 years, drafted off the St. Louis Cardinals' Class AA roster.\n\nZack Short, IF: Journeyman big-league infielder (Tigers, Mets, Red Sox, Braves, Astros) signed a minor league deal. Appeared in 22 games last year with Houston.\n\nAli Sanchez, C: Part-time, right-handed hitting MLB catcher since 2020 appeared in a combined12 games last season with the Blue Jays and Red Sox.\n\nYerry Rodriguez, RHP: Reliever is rehabbing from Tommy John surgery in early 2025. Has 30 games of MLB experience (2022-24) with the Rangers and Blue Jays.\n\nWinquest is an intriguing addition, giving a window to the Yanks' current financial restraint, too. Meanwhile, it's a seller's market for right-handed hitters.\n\nThis week, the Yanks watched lefty-mashing outfielder Rob Refsnyder - who could have fit a pinstriped need - agree on a one-year, $6.25 million free agent contact with the Seattle Mariners.\n\nDevin Williams, RHP: Right-handed reliever signed a three-year, $51 million free agent deal to now replace Edwin Diaz (free agent, signed with Dodgers) as the Mets' closer.\n\nLuke Weaver, RHP: Setup reliever followed Williams to the Mets on a two-year, $22 million free agent deal.\n\nAllan Winans, RHP: Obtained release waivers in order to sign with Japan's Seibu Lions.\n\nIan Hamilton, Mark Leiter Jr., Scott Effross, Jake Cousins, RHPs: All four relievers were non-tendered, making them free agents. Hamilton (Braves) and Leiter Jr. (Athletics) have since signed with other clubs.\n\nAcquiring relievers with team control at last summer's trade deadline (David Bednar, Camilo Doval, Jake Bird) made the Yanks less desperate but still in search of another veteran setup arm.\n\nOn the trade front, they've been among the teams linked to interest in St. Louis Cardinals lefty reliever JoJo Romero, who is entering his free agent walk year.\n\nCody Bellinger, OF: In addition to the Yankees, he's linked to interest by the Mets, Blue Jays, Dodgers, Giants and Angels.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt, 1B: Compiled a .981 OPS versus left-handed pitching in 2025 and expressed a desire to play in 2026 at age 38.\n\nAustin Slater, OF: Played a very limited bench role and was injured (hamstring) after being acquired at last summer's MLB trade deadline.\n\nJonathan Loaisiga, RHP: Yankees rejected a $5 million club option on the talented, injury prone setup reliever.\n\nShould we be surprised if Bellinger’s free agency lingers well into January?\n\nKyle Tucker’s free agent market hasn’t been defined, which impacts Bellinger (an obvious target for contenders still seeking an impact, lefty-hitting outfielder).\n\nAt the Winter Meetings, Cashman said that Bellinger’s slow pace won’t prevent them from making other moves as needed, though the Yanks’ transactions have since been relatively minor.\n\nToronto Blue Jays: Signed RH free agent starters Dylan Cease (7 years, $210 million) and Cody Ponce (3 years, $30 million) and RH reliever Tyler Rogers (3 years, $37 million).\n\nBoston Red Sox: Added RH starters Sonny Gray (Cardinals), Johan Oviedo (Pirates) and 1B-DH Willson Contreras (Cardinals) via trade.\n\nBaltimore Orioles: Signed free agent 1B Pete Alonso (5 years, $155 million), free agent closer Ryan Helsley (2 years, $28 million). Added RH starter Shane Baz (Rays), OF Taylor Ward (Angels) via trade.\n\nTampa Bay Rays: Signed free agent LHP Steven Matz (2 years, $15 million) and OF Cedric Mullins (1 year, $7.5 million). Added OF Jacob Melton (Astros) and RHPs Anderson Brito (Astros) and Yoendrys Gomez (White Sox) via trade.\n\nThe defending AL champion Blue Jays' quick strike to sign Cease and the O's aggressive signing of Alonso have been highlights of MLB's offseason.\n\nBoston and Toronto are top contenders in the bidding for free agent righty hitters Alex Bregman and Bo Bichette, which would only further strengthen the league's best division.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: What are Yankees doing?

    "fullText": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing a notable free agent they have been linked to for a very team-friendly rate.\n\nThe Mets and Yankees had very different results in their 2025 MLB campaigns. While both clubs entered the year as serious World Series contenders and were two of the best teams in the league during the first half, the club from Queens shockingly collapsed in September and missed the playoffs. Although the Yanks got to the playoffs, they were ousted in the divisional round by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nAfter seasons that fell well below expectations, both clubs have been active this offseason as they look to improve their roster. Oddly enough, they are also in the market for the same positions. Each team is looking to bolster its rotation and is reportedly pursuing Michael King. They are also looking for new first basemen.\n\nTo the chagrin of Mets fans, the team lost home run king Pete Alonso in free agency to the Baltimore Orioles. While the Yankees are expected to move on from Paul Goldschmidt. Unsurprisingly, they have both been linked to Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami. A player whose market is reportedly weaker than he and his reps expected.\n\nRecent reports have suggested the corner infielder’s market has been weak as he closes in on the Dec. 22 deadline for him to sign with an MLB team. It has created some speculation that he might just end up returning to Japan if he doesn’t get the sort of offer he is looking for. However, Ken Rosenthal doesn’t buy into that discourse.\n\nIn a new report, he spoke about how Murakami’s swing and miss rate is believed to be the big reason why some teams are balking at giving the 25-year-old a big long-term contract. Rosenthal believes that the issue is overblown, and Shohei Ohtani had a higher rate before he made the move from Japan in 2018. The MLB insider firmly believes Murakami will be playing in the MLB next season.\n\nMunetaka Murakami stats: 69 G, .286 AVG, .392 OBP, .659 SLG, 1.051 OPS, 24 HR, 52 RBI, 40 R\n\nThat is very good news for the Mets and Yankees. Despite the questions about his defense and swing and miss rate, he is one of the greatest home run hitters in Japanese baseball history, and still hasn’t even hit his prime. With far fewer teams expected to be in on him, the pair of New York clubs could get a young player with huge upside at a far cheaper rate than they expected a month ago, or for fewer years.\n\nNew York Jets Player Requests Release From Team After 28-Point Loss\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "fullText": "Orioles face massive Yankees and Red Sox challenge in Michael King pursuit originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles find themselves facing massive odds to sign free agent pitcher Michael King, as two other American League East teams have joined the race for the former San Diego Padres pitcher. The right-handed ace has reportedly narrowed down the list to these three AL East teams, and as per sources, a decision could come soon.\n\nAccording to MLB insider Ken Rosenthal, the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox are both interested in the proven commodity. The insider has suggested that for the Orioles to get their hands on King, they'll have to outbid both AL East competitors, which will be a massive task, given the big market status.\n\nKing actually has local ties with Boston, as he went to Bishop Hendricken High School in Rhode Island and pitched for Boston College. Meanwhile, the Yankees are also associated with the pitcher since they traded for him from the Miami Marlins in November 2017. Earlier, there were rumors that the Chicago Cubs were an interested party, but now it appears his free agency has settled down for an AL East competitor.\n\nThe right-hander is a proven commodity in the majors. He was part of the transaction that sent Juan Soto to the New York Yankees before the 2024 season, thereby landing with the Padres, where he became a reliable arm, posting a sub-3.00 ERA in 173.2 innings. Due to shoulder and knee inflammation this year, he could only make 15 starts, recording a 3.44 ERA with a 1.20 WHIP.\n\nThe Orioles have already shown signs of improvement this offseason as they added Pete Alonso on a five-year, $155 million deal. Adding a reliable arm like King to their rotation will enhance their rotation, which also includes established pieces such as Trevor Rogers and Kyle Bradish, and will help Baltimore get back to the postseason after missing it in 2025.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Orioles, despite the uphill task to outdo AL East giants, can get King to sign with them.\n\nOrioles' Pete Alonso shares heartwarming reason behind new jersey number\n\nOrioles get lackluster grade for $28 million Ryan Helsley signing\n\nOrioles' next roster move after Ryan Helsley $28 million deal is clear\n\nOrioles sign former Mets, Cardinals All-Star closer to two-year deal",

    "fullText": "Are the Yankees considering a Michael King reunion?\n\nThe Boston Globe's Peter Abraham reported this week that New York, the Orioles and Red Sox \"are competing for\" the free-agent right-hander, whose \"decision is not necessarily soon.\"\n\nThe New York Post's Greg Joyce added that the Yankees are \"open to\" reuniting with King, 30, whom they dealt among others to the Padres in their December 2023 trade with San Diego for outfielders Juan Soto and Trent Grisham.\n\n\"The thing about Kinger is he's got obviously great stuff and a great arsenal,\" New York manager Aaron Boone said last week at the 2025 MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando, Fla., according to Joyce. \"He’s really smart and has a real good understanding of that stuff. It's allowed him to evolve as a pitcher, coupled with his confidence.\"\n\nStarting 45 of 46 regular-season games for the Padres from 2024-25, King went 18-12 with a 3.10 ERA and 1.194 WHIP in 247 IP. He battled injuries during his second year in San Diego, limiting him to 73.1 IP over 15 starts.\n\n\"We are playing around with a lot of different ideas and seeing if it takes us anywhere,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman told YES Network last week.\n\nKing transitioned from reliever to starter at the end of his time in New York, a chapter that spanned five MLB seasons (2019-23). He made his MLB debut Sept. 27, 2019, with the Yankees, who landed him from the Miami Marlins in a November 2017 trade.\n\nThe Marlins originally selected King from Boston College with the No. 353 overall pick in the 12th round of the 2016 MLB Draft. The Rochester, N.Y., native played at Warwick (R.I.) Bishop Hendrickson High School before heading to Boston College from 2014-16.",
