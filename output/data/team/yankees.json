    "fullText": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing a notable free agent they have been linked to for a very team-friendly rate.\n\nThe Mets and Yankees had very different results in their 2025 MLB campaigns. While both clubs entered the year as serious World Series contenders and were two of the best teams in the league during the first half, the club from Queens shockingly collapsed in September and missed the playoffs. Although the Yanks got to the playoffs, they were ousted in the divisional round by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nAfter seasons that fell well below expectations, both clubs have been active this offseason as they look to improve their roster. Oddly enough, they are also in the market for the same positions. Each team is looking to bolster its rotation and is reportedly pursuing Michael King. They are also looking for new first basemen.\n\nTo the chagrin of Mets fans, the team lost home run king Pete Alonso in free agency to the Baltimore Orioles. While the Yankees are expected to move on from Paul Goldschmidt. Unsurprisingly, they have both been linked to Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami. A player whose market is reportedly weaker than he and his reps expected.\n\nRecent reports have suggested the corner infielder’s market has been weak as he closes in on the Dec. 22 deadline for him to sign with an MLB team. It has created some speculation that he might just end up returning to Japan if he doesn’t get the sort of offer he is looking for. However, Ken Rosenthal doesn’t buy into that discourse.\n\nIn a new report, he spoke about how Murakami’s swing and miss rate is believed to be the big reason why some teams are balking at giving the 25-year-old a big long-term contract. Rosenthal believes that the issue is overblown, and Shohei Ohtani had a higher rate before he made the move from Japan in 2018. The MLB insider firmly believes Murakami will be playing in the MLB next season.\n\nMunetaka Murakami stats: 69 G, .286 AVG, .392 OBP, .659 SLG, 1.051 OPS, 24 HR, 52 RBI, 40 R\n\nThat is very good news for the Mets and Yankees. Despite the questions about his defense and swing and miss rate, he is one of the greatest home run hitters in Japanese baseball history, and still hasn’t even hit his prime. With far fewer teams expected to be in on him, the pair of New York clubs could get a young player with huge upside at a far cheaper rate than they expected a month ago, or for fewer years.\n\nNew York Jets Player Requests Release From Team After 28-Point Loss\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "fullText": "Orioles face massive Yankees and Red Sox challenge in Michael King pursuit originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles find themselves facing massive odds to sign free agent pitcher Michael King, as two other American League East teams have joined the race for the former San Diego Padres pitcher. The right-handed ace has reportedly narrowed down the list to these three AL East teams, and as per sources, a decision could come soon.\n\nAccording to MLB insider Ken Rosenthal, the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox are both interested in the proven commodity. The insider has suggested that for the Orioles to get their hands on King, they'll have to outbid both AL East competitors, which will be a massive task, given the big market status.\n\nKing actually has local ties with Boston, as he went to Bishop Hendricken High School in Rhode Island and pitched for Boston College. Meanwhile, the Yankees are also associated with the pitcher since they traded for him from the Miami Marlins in November 2017. Earlier, there were rumors that the Chicago Cubs were an interested party, but now it appears his free agency has settled down for an AL East competitor.\n\nThe right-hander is a proven commodity in the majors. He was part of the transaction that sent Juan Soto to the New York Yankees before the 2024 season, thereby landing with the Padres, where he became a reliable arm, posting a sub-3.00 ERA in 173.2 innings. Due to shoulder and knee inflammation this year, he could only make 15 starts, recording a 3.44 ERA with a 1.20 WHIP.\n\nThe Orioles have already shown signs of improvement this offseason as they added Pete Alonso on a five-year, $155 million deal. Adding a reliable arm like King to their rotation will enhance their rotation, which also includes established pieces such as Trevor Rogers and Kyle Bradish, and will help Baltimore get back to the postseason after missing it in 2025.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Orioles, despite the uphill task to outdo AL East giants, can get King to sign with them.\n\nOrioles' Pete Alonso shares heartwarming reason behind new jersey number\n\nOrioles get lackluster grade for $28 million Ryan Helsley signing\n\nOrioles' next roster move after Ryan Helsley $28 million deal is clear\n\nOrioles sign former Mets, Cardinals All-Star closer to two-year deal",

    "fullText": "Are the Yankees considering a Michael King reunion?\n\nThe Boston Globe's Peter Abraham reported this week that New York, the Orioles and Red Sox \"are competing for\" the free-agent right-hander, whose \"decision is not necessarily soon.\"\n\nThe New York Post's Greg Joyce added that the Yankees are \"open to\" reuniting with King, 30, whom they dealt among others to the Padres in their December 2023 trade with San Diego for outfielders Juan Soto and Trent Grisham.\n\n\"The thing about Kinger is he's got obviously great stuff and a great arsenal,\" New York manager Aaron Boone said last week at the 2025 MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando, Fla., according to Joyce. \"He’s really smart and has a real good understanding of that stuff. It's allowed him to evolve as a pitcher, coupled with his confidence.\"\n\nStarting 45 of 46 regular-season games for the Padres from 2024-25, King went 18-12 with a 3.10 ERA and 1.194 WHIP in 247 IP. He battled injuries during his second year in San Diego, limiting him to 73.1 IP over 15 starts.\n\n\"We are playing around with a lot of different ideas and seeing if it takes us anywhere,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman told YES Network last week.\n\nKing transitioned from reliever to starter at the end of his time in New York, a chapter that spanned five MLB seasons (2019-23). He made his MLB debut Sept. 27, 2019, with the Yankees, who landed him from the Miami Marlins in a November 2017 trade.\n\nThe Marlins originally selected King from Boston College with the No. 353 overall pick in the 12th round of the 2016 MLB Draft. The Rochester, N.Y., native played at Warwick (R.I.) Bishop Hendrickson High School before heading to Boston College from 2014-16.",
