    "fullText": "MLB.com | Brian Murphy: Tatsuya Imai, the top NPB player on the free agent market, is reportedly meeting with teams in Los Angeles ahead of his Friday afternoon deadline to sign. It’s unclear whether the Yankees are among those teams meeting in-person with Imai, though reports still link them, along with the Phillies and White Sox, to the right-hander. Imai, just 27-years-old, posted a 1.92 ERA over 163.2 innings in NPB last season, and may command a nine-figure guarantee.\n\nNew York Daily News | Peter Sblendorio: Now that the first quarter of the 21st century is in the books, the Daily News picked their All-Century New York team, selecting the best player from the last 25 years for each of New York’s teams. The top Yankee? None other than Aaron Judge. Judge had to beat out Derek Jeter, who won two World Series and racked up over 2,600 hits in the 2000’s, Alex Rodriguez, who won two MVP’s as a Yankee in the 21st century, and many other greats, but it’s clear that Judge’s resume has no peer. There are some debates with the other NY teams as well; Jalen Brunson, who’s played just 3.5 seasons in New York, is the Knicks’ All-Century selection, while Michael Strahan gets the nod over Eli Manning for the Giants.\n\nMLB.com | Sarah Langs: To close out 2025, the great Sarah Langs highlighted at least one amazing stat for each team from last season. For the Yankees, it of course came from Aaron Judge. Judge led MLB in batting average, OBP, and slugging percentage, the triple-slash triple crown, becoming just the fifth man in the expansion era to do so. He also set a record with 20 first-inning home runs.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf the New York Yankees are serious about landing another ace-caliber arm, Hunter Greene is the type of guy who fits exactly what they’d be looking for. He’s 26 years old, has elite stuff, and is under team control until 2029.\n\nHowever, that’s why prying him from the Cincinnati Reds wouldn’t be cheap.\n\nCincinnati has no reason to move Greene unless the return is incredible. He isn’t a rental, and he isn’t anything short of a star. He’s a prime-aged arm the Reds can build around, so any trade conversation would start with the Yankees giving up multiple top prospects.\n\nSB Nation proposed a trade that shows just how high the price would be.\n\nIn the pitch, the Yankees would send George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodriguez as the headliners, along with two additional prospects, likely from their upper-level pitching group. The Yankees' upper-level pitching is as good as any in baseball.\n\n“Given his age (26), ability, and contract terms, it’s difficult to find a good comp for the type of package it would take to pry him from Cincy. The Red Sox’s trades for Chris Sale and Garrett Crochet are fairly decent, the Astros’ acquisition of Gerrit Cole and Orioles’ move for Corbin Burnes less so.\n\n“At a minimum, it looks like the Reds could demand a pair of consensus top-100 prospects plus at least another pair less-heralded youngsters. It’s not a stretch to imagine the Reds demanding George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodríguez in addition to several of the impressive crop of upper level pitching prospects,” Peter Brody wrote.\n\nPerhaps the Yankees will want to add a bat with those prospects instead of a pitcher, but having another arm like Greene is never a bad idea.\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed\n\nESPN trade rumor has Yankees acquiring two veteran stars from Twins\n\nYankees urged to swap Jasson Dominguez to Marlins for 6'5'' ace",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees continue to be the favorites for Cody Bellinger, especially as the offseason market develops the way we’ve seen it.\n\nBellinger hasn’t moved quickly, and that’s probably because of Kyle Tucker not signing yet. The market has been a bit hotter recently, but it’s still relatively slow.\n\nNew York has familiarity with Bellinger, a need for an outfielder/first baseman, and should have more than enough to pay him.\n\nAlexander Wilson of Empire Sports believes those reasons will ultimately lead Bellinger back to the Bronx. Wilson predicted Bellinger would sign a five-year, $170 million deal with the Yankees once the market settles.\n\n“Right now, Bellinger’s camp is asking for the moon and stars, trying to leverage his name value into a contract that simply doesn’t exist in this sinking market,” Wilson wrote.\n\n“However, reality is setting in, and I predict he will settle for a five-year, $170 million deal once he realizes the Yankees are the only team offering both the money and the familiarity he’s looking for. This aligns with the front office’s broader strategy, which involves the complex Yankees architecture of signing two Boras clients in the same offseason.”\n\nSome have said Bellinger wants big-time money, which he deserves.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOnce the New York Yankees feel comfortable with how the lineup looks, the next move feels obvious. The rotation still needs help.\n\nNew York has enough arms to get through the regular season, but that’s not really the idea here. Injuries are already part of the conversation with Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodon, and there isn’t much if they were to be hurt.\n\nSure, the Yankees' staff is decent, but it needs to stay healthy.\n\nSigning depth helps, but it doesn’t change that reality.\n\nIf the Yankees decide to be aggressive, it’s likely going to be via trade rather than another short-term signing. They’ve shown a willingness to deal from prospect depth when the fit makes sense, and I’d expect that to be the case again this winter.\n\nThat’s where Freddy Peralta comes into play. The Milwaukee Brewers right-hander is under control, elite, and capable of handling a significant workload.\n\nHe’s the type of starter who would change things for New York.\n\nAlexander Wilson of Empire Sports predicted the Yankees will pivot in that direction once the lineup is settled and sign Peralta.\n\n“Once the lineup is secured, I expect Cashman to aggressively pivot to the rotation by targeting Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta. The Yankees and Brewers already have a well-oiled trade pipeline, established last winter when New York sent Nestor Cortes and Caleb Durbin to Milwaukee for Devin Williams.\n\n“While the recent move where the Yankees re-sign Paul Blackburn to a one-year, $2 million contract provides depth, it does not move the needle for a team trying to win a World Series. Peralta is the legitimate frontline hammer that helps protect a unit already dealing with major injury questions,” he wrote.\n\nIf the Yankees make a move, it’s hard to see it being for another depth arm.

    "fullText": "Beyond some recycled gifts, the Yankees moved into the holidays without delivering any big presents to their eager fan base.\n\nAnd outside of wanting to reunite with free agent Cody Bellinger, who is a fit for several contenders, the Yankees’ winter plan has been to marginally upgrade areas of need without spending a great deal.\n\nThat syncs with owner Hal Steinbrenner’s “ideal’’ of a payroll below the final luxury tax threshold, and GM Brian Cashman’s thoughts about the current club.\n\n“Don’t misinterpret that as saying I don’t recognize that there’s areas of weakness on this roster that we have to improve upon,\" Cashman said earlier this month. “It’s just not as prevalent as last year where we really had to do a lot of different things on the run.\n\nTrent Grisham, CF: Accepted the one-year, $22.025 million free agent qualifying offer extended by the Yankees.\n\nTim Hill, LHP: Setup reliever had his $3 million option for 2026 triggered by the team.\n\nAmed Rosario, IF: Signed to a guaranteed, one-year, $2.5 million free agent contract.\n\nPaul Blackburn, RHP: Agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract that could earn him another $500,000 in performance bonuses, as first reported by the New York Post.\n\nRyan Yarbrough, LHP: Returned on a one-year, $2.5 million free agent contract in mid-November.\n\nAn expensive runback with Grisham at least provides cover in center field if Bellinger signs elsewhere.\n\nThat leaves Jasson Dominguez as the leading left field candidate and puts lefty-slugging prospect Spencer Jones in play for a potentially significant role in 2026.\n\nRosario provides a righty-hitting platoon for third baseman Ryan McMahon, but the Yanks still seek a right-handed hitting outfield presence.\n\nYarbrough and Blackburn bolster a staff that needs flexible, veteran starting options that can collapse into relief roles once the rehabbing Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodon and Clarke Schmidt return.\n\nCade Winquest, RHP: Hard-throwing reliever became the Yankees' first Rule 5 selection in 14 years, drafted off the St. Louis Cardinals' Class AA roster.\n\nZack Short, IF: Journeyman big-league infielder (Tigers, Mets, Red Sox, Braves, Astros) signed a minor league deal. Appeared in 22 games last year with Houston.\n\nAli Sanchez, C: Part-time, right-handed hitting MLB catcher since 2020 appeared in a combined12 games last season with the Blue Jays and Red Sox.\n\nYerry Rodriguez, RHP: Reliever is rehabbing from Tommy John surgery in early 2025. Has 30 games of MLB experience (2022-24) with the Rangers and Blue Jays.\n\nWinquest is an intriguing addition, giving a window to the Yanks' current financial restraint, too. Meanwhile, it's a seller's market for right-handed hitters.\n\nThis week, the Yanks watched lefty-mashing outfielder Rob Refsnyder - who could have fit a pinstriped need - agree on a one-year, $6.25 million free agent contact with the Seattle Mariners.\n\nDevin Williams, RHP: Right-handed reliever signed a three-year, $51 million free agent deal to now replace Edwin Diaz (free agent, signed with Dodgers) as the Mets' closer.\n\nLuke Weaver, RHP: Setup reliever followed Williams to the Mets on a two-year, $22 million free agent deal.\n\nAllan Winans, RHP: Obtained release waivers in order to sign with Japan's Seibu Lions.\n\nIan Hamilton, Mark Leiter Jr., Scott Effross, Jake Cousins, RHPs: All four relievers were non-tendered, making them free agents. Hamilton (Braves) and Leiter Jr. (Athletics) have since signed with other clubs.\n\nAcquiring relievers with team control at last summer's trade deadline (David Bednar, Camilo Doval, Jake Bird) made the Yanks less desperate but still in search of another veteran setup arm.\n\nOn the trade front, they've been among the teams linked to interest in St. Louis Cardinals lefty reliever JoJo Romero, who is entering his free agent walk year.\n\nCody Bellinger, OF: In addition to the Yankees, he's linked to interest by the Mets, Blue Jays, Dodgers, Giants and Angels.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt, 1B: Compiled a .981 OPS versus left-handed pitching in 2025 and expressed a desire to play in 2026 at age 38.\n\nAustin Slater, OF: Played a very limited bench role and was injured (hamstring) after being acquired at last summer's MLB trade deadline.\n\nJonathan Loaisiga, RHP: Yankees rejected a $5 million club option on the talented, injury prone setup reliever.\n\nShould we be surprised if Bellinger’s free agency lingers well into January?\n\nKyle Tucker’s free agent market hasn’t been defined, which impacts Bellinger (an obvious target for contenders still seeking an impact, lefty-hitting outfielder).\n\nAt the Winter Meetings, Cashman said that Bellinger’s slow pace won’t prevent them from making other moves as needed, though the Yanks’ transactions have since been relatively minor.\n\nToronto Blue Jays: Signed RH free agent starters Dylan Cease (7 years, $210 million) and Cody Ponce (3 years, $30 million) and RH reliever Tyler Rogers (3 years, $37 million).\n\nBoston Red Sox: Added RH starters Sonny Gray (Cardinals), Johan Oviedo (Pirates) and 1B-DH Willson Contreras (Cardinals) via trade.\n\nBaltimore Orioles: Signed free agent 1B Pete Alonso (5 years, $155 million), free agent closer Ryan Helsley (2 years, $28 million). Added RH starter Shane Baz (Rays), OF Taylor Ward (Angels) via trade.\n\nTampa Bay Rays: Signed free agent LHP Steven Matz (2 years, $15 million) and OF Cedric Mullins (1 year, $7.5 million). Added OF Jacob Melton (Astros) and RHPs Anderson Brito (Astros) and Yoendrys Gomez (White Sox) via trade.\n\nThe defending AL champion Blue Jays' quick strike to sign Cease and the O's aggressive signing of Alonso have been highlights of MLB's offseason.\n\nBoston and Toronto are top contenders in the bidding for free agent righty hitters Alex Bregman and Bo Bichette, which would only further strengthen the league's best division.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: What are Yankees doing?

    "fullText": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing a notable free agent they have been linked to for a very team-friendly rate.\n\nThe Mets and Yankees had very different results in their 2025 MLB campaigns. While both clubs entered the year as serious World Series contenders and were two of the best teams in the league during the first half, the club from Queens shockingly collapsed in September and missed the playoffs. Although the Yanks got to the playoffs, they were ousted in the divisional round by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nAfter seasons that fell well below expectations, both clubs have been active this offseason as they look to improve their roster. Oddly enough, they are also in the market for the same positions. Each team is looking to bolster its rotation and is reportedly pursuing Michael King. They are also looking for new first basemen.\n\nTo the chagrin of Mets fans, the team lost home run king Pete Alonso in free agency to the Baltimore Orioles. While the Yankees are expected to move on from Paul Goldschmidt. Unsurprisingly, they have both been linked to Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami. A player whose market is reportedly weaker than he and his reps expected.\n\nRecent reports have suggested the corner infielder’s market has been weak as he closes in on the Dec. 22 deadline for him to sign with an MLB team. It has created some speculation that he might just end up returning to Japan if he doesn’t get the sort of offer he is looking for. However, Ken Rosenthal doesn’t buy into that discourse.\n\nIn a new report, he spoke about how Murakami’s swing and miss rate is believed to be the big reason why some teams are balking at giving the 25-year-old a big long-term contract. Rosenthal believes that the issue is overblown, and Shohei Ohtani had a higher rate before he made the move from Japan in 2018. The MLB insider firmly believes Murakami will be playing in the MLB next season.\n\nMunetaka Murakami stats: 69 G, .286 AVG, .392 OBP, .659 SLG, 1.051 OPS, 24 HR, 52 RBI, 40 R\n\nThat is very good news for the Mets and Yankees. Despite the questions about his defense and swing and miss rate, he is one of the greatest home run hitters in Japanese baseball history, and still hasn’t even hit his prime. With far fewer teams expected to be in on him, the pair of New York clubs could get a young player with huge upside at a far cheaper rate than they expected a month ago, or for fewer years.\n\nNew York Jets Player Requests Release From Team After 28-Point Loss\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "fullText": "Orioles face massive Yankees and Red Sox challenge in Michael King pursuit originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles find themselves facing massive odds to sign free agent pitcher Michael King, as two other American League East teams have joined the race for the former San Diego Padres pitcher. The right-handed ace has reportedly narrowed down the list to these three AL East teams, and as per sources, a decision could come soon.\n\nAccording to MLB insider Ken Rosenthal, the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox are both interested in the proven commodity. The insider has suggested that for the Orioles to get their hands on King, they'll have to outbid both AL East competitors, which will be a massive task, given the big market status.\n\nKing actually has local ties with Boston, as he went to Bishop Hendricken High School in Rhode Island and pitched for Boston College. Meanwhile, the Yankees are also associated with the pitcher since they traded for him from the Miami Marlins in November 2017. Earlier, there were rumors that the Chicago Cubs were an interested party, but now it appears his free agency has settled down for an AL East competitor.\n\nThe right-hander is a proven commodity in the majors. He was part of the transaction that sent Juan Soto to the New York Yankees before the 2024 season, thereby landing with the Padres, where he became a reliable arm, posting a sub-3.00 ERA in 173.2 innings. Due to shoulder and knee inflammation this year, he could only make 15 starts, recording a 3.44 ERA with a 1.20 WHIP.\n\nThe Orioles have already shown signs of improvement this offseason as they added Pete Alonso on a five-year, $155 million deal. Adding a reliable arm like King to their rotation will enhance their rotation, which also includes established pieces such as Trevor Rogers and Kyle Bradish, and will help Baltimore get back to the postseason after missing it in 2025.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Orioles, despite the uphill task to outdo AL East giants, can get King to sign with them.\n\nOrioles' Pete Alonso shares heartwarming reason behind new jersey number\n\nOrioles get lackluster grade for $28 million Ryan Helsley signing\n\nOrioles' next roster move after Ryan Helsley $28 million deal is clear\n\nOrioles sign former Mets, Cardinals All-Star closer to two-year deal",

    "fullText": "Are the Yankees considering a Michael King reunion?\n\nThe Boston Globe's Peter Abraham reported this week that New York, the Orioles and Red Sox \"are competing for\" the free-agent right-hander, whose \"decision is not necessarily soon.\"\n\nThe New York Post's Greg Joyce added that the Yankees are \"open to\" reuniting with King, 30, whom they dealt among others to the Padres in their December 2023 trade with San Diego for outfielders Juan Soto and Trent Grisham.\n\n\"The thing about Kinger is he's got obviously great stuff and a great arsenal,\" New York manager Aaron Boone said last week at the 2025 MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando, Fla., according to Joyce. \"He’s really smart and has a real good understanding of that stuff. It's allowed him to evolve as a pitcher, coupled with his confidence.\"\n\nStarting 45 of 46 regular-season games for the Padres from 2024-25, King went 18-12 with a 3.10 ERA and 1.194 WHIP in 247 IP. He battled injuries during his second year in San Diego, limiting him to 73.1 IP over 15 starts.\n\n\"We are playing around with a lot of different ideas and seeing if it takes us anywhere,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman told YES Network last week.\n\nKing transitioned from reliever to starter at the end of his time in New York, a chapter that spanned five MLB seasons (2019-23). He made his MLB debut Sept. 27, 2019, with the Yankees, who landed him from the Miami Marlins in a November 2017 trade.\n\nThe Marlins originally selected King from Boston College with the No. 353 overall pick in the 12th round of the 2016 MLB Draft. The Rochester, N.Y., native played at Warwick (R.I.) Bishop Hendrickson High School before heading to Boston College from 2014-16.",
