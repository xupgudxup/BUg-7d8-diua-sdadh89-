    "description": "Lakers coach JJ Redick and star guard Luka Doncic say the team must change and get back on track after a 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets Thursday.",
    "fullText": "JJ Redick repeats the same key words after every loss: effort and execution. The Lakers found none of either at Crypto.com Arena on Thursday in a 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets that played out with a plot as familiar as a Hallmark holiday movie.\n\nGetting outhustled by a team that simply played harder with more energy, the Lakers (19-10) dropped their third consecutive game. It’s their longest losing streak of the season and left the team questioning its identity.\n\n“I don't know what has to change,” said guard Luka Doncic, who led the Lakers with 25 points and seven assists, but had six turnovers. “But definitely something needs to change.”\n\nHere are three takeaways from the loss:\n\nWhen the Lakers were climbing up the Western Conference standings, improbably winning games with LeBron James and Luka Doncic injured and celebrating Austin Reaves’ 51-point performance and ascent into stardom, the vibes were high. Players jumped off the bench to cheer for each other. They championed team bonding exercises such as slideshow presentations that introduced themselves to each other and a field trip to a Porsche driving experience. It all felt surprisingly easy, especially for a team that had several new additions.\n\n“We had it,” Redick said wistfully Thursday. “We had it. I always say this about culture, I always say this about a good team being a functioning organism.”\n\n“It can change like that,” he continued. “We don’t have it right now.”\n\nAll three of the Lakers’ most recent losses have been blowouts. With an average margin of defeat of 20.7 points, their total point differential has dropped to minus-15 on the season, which ranks 16th in the NBA.\n\nForward Jake LaRavia said in the locker room that there felt like a “disconnect” on the team, but couldn’t verbalize more about how things had turned so suddenly. The team’s seven-game winning streak at the end of November feels like a distant memory, although it should serve as a constant reminder of how a team shouldn’t let its guard down, especially when it was just collecting wins off teams with losing records.\n\n“This [has] kind of been the trending thing even when we were winning,” forward Jarred Vanderbilt said. “Obviously wins kinda shadow a lot of stuff. But it's been the same pretty much all year of how we finished games, lose games: transition defense, rebounding and stuff like that. It's been a trend all year.\"\n\nLeBron James, who played in his 13th game this season after missing the first 14 games because of sciatica, had 18 points and five assists and declined to speak with reporters after the game, along with Marcus Smart (six points, two rebounds) and Rui Hachimura (zero points, two assists).\n\nTo further exasperate the lingering injury bug, Reaves left the game after the first half because of left calf soreness. It was the same calf that sidelined him for three games last week.\n\nVanderbilt was one of the few bright spots for the Lakers, finishing with eight points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal. His energy off the bench in the second quarter, especially when playing with Smart, who fought through a right shoulder injury, helped the Lakers force four turnovers in a five-minute stretch. Vanderbilt’s three-pointer with 4:16 remaining in the second that trimmed the lead to four was one of the few moments that made the mostly apathetic holiday crowd roar.\n\nVanderbilt’s offensive deficiencies were the primary reason he fell out of the rotation for 10 games, but since returning to the lineup regularly against Phoenix on Dec. 14, Vanderbilt has made seven of 13 three-pointers in five games, including three for four on Thursday. It was his first game as a Laker with three made threes.\n\nOutside of LaRavia, who stayed on the court after both teams had otherwise emptied the bench, Vanderbilt was the only Laker who had a positive plus-minus. The Lakers outscored the Rockets by five in Vanderbilt’s 26 minutes and 23 seconds on the floor.\n\n“I feel like I try to come in the game and bring that energy and hoping guys could feed off it,” Vanderbilt said. “But we need to play [like] that for 48 minutes. … We just got to dig deep and want to do it.”\n\nThe Rockets (18-10) are not just the NBA’s best rebounding team, but they could be the best in a generation. The team’s 55.6% rebounding rate is the best in the NBA on record since at least the 1996-97 season.\n\nHouston’s dominance on the boards was at the top of Redick’s mind before the game when he estimated the Rockets were the best rebounding team since the 1994-95 Mavericks. He emphasized the importance of gang rebounding against a team known for its physically imposing double-big lineup and athletic wings.\n\nThen the Rockets grabbed two offensive rebounds in their first two possessions. The Rockets outrebounded the Lakers 48-25, the Lakers’ largest rebounding deficit since Nov. 8, 2023, which was also against Houston. Houston had 17 offensive rebounds, only one fewer than the Lakers’ defensive rebounding total, and with 12 rebounds, center Alpren Sengun matched the Lakers’ entire starting lineup on the boards.\n\n“Everybody gotta give better effort,” Doncic said, “starting with me.”\n\nDoncic had five rebounds, tied with Vanderbilt for the team lead. Center Deandre Ayton had just two boards and 10 points in 36 minutes and 17 seconds. It was the 7-footer’s lowet rebounding total of the season.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

The Purple and Gold never managed to bounce back, suffering their third straight defeat.\n\nAfter the game, Doncic was an image of frustration. He, however, admitted that he was accountable for their loss.\n\n“Everyone has to give better effort, starting with me,” said the 26-year-old star, as quoted by The Athletic’s Dan Woike.\n\nDoncic tallied 25 points on 9-of-17 shooting, five rebounds, and seven assists. He also had a game-high six turnovers.\n\nLeBron James added 18 points, five rebounds, and two steals. Austin Reaves, meanwhile, had to be pulled out early in the game after reaggravating his calf injury. He had 12 points in 15 minutes.\n\nLos Angeles allowed Houston to shoot 53% from the field and got outrebounded, 48-25. The Rockets scored 23 points off the 16 turnovers of the Lakers.\n\nThe 26-year-old Doncic has said he needs to regain the defensive effort he showed in the first few games of the season. He has been slowed down by injuries as of late, but it shouldn’t be an excuse for a perennial All-Star to play lackadaisically.\n\nLakers coach JJ Redick has repeatedly rhapsodized about making a complete effort on both ends, and as Doncic acknowledged, he should be the one setting an example for everyone.\n\nThe Lakers fell to 19-10, including 7-5 at home.",

    "fullText": "JJ Redick rips Lakers with 4-word message after brutal Rockets loss appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nLOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles Lakers’ current losing streak hit three games following their 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day. For the Lakers, there are plenty of issues to discuss in regards to their poor play as of late. But for head coach JJ Redick, the ultimate reason for the team’s recent stretch can be summed up in four simple words.\n\n“We don’t care enough,” Redick said following the Lakers’ Christmas Day loss to the Rockets. “And that’s the part that bothers me a lot. We don’t care enough to do the things that are necessary, and we don’t care enough to be a professional. We had it, we had it. I always say this about culture, I always say this about a good team being a functioning organism, it can change like that. We don’t have it right now.”\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Lakers were a step slower than the Rockets on both ends of the court. They found themselves trailing by double digits early in the first quarter, 18-8, and by the end of the period they were down 37-25.\n\nIt was still a double digit deficit at halftime, and the second half didn’t get any better with the Rockets’ lead ballooning to 20 points almost midway through the third quarter. The Lakers couldn’t rebound, they couldn’t get stops and they couldn’t string together enough consistency offensively. To make matters worse, Austin Reaves was ruled out for the second half due to his ongoing calf injury. In the first half, Reaves had been the only consistent offensive threat for the team.\n\nJJ Redick didn’t hold back words when summing up what kind of team the Lakers are right now, while acknowledging that he told the team postgame to expect an uncomfortable practice this weekend.\n\n“The two words of the day were effort and execution. I feel like when we’ve done both those things at a high level, we’ve been a good basketball team,” Redick said. “When we haven’t, we’re a terrible basketball team, and tonight we were a terrible basketball team. That started legitimately right away.”\n\nThe Lakers were outrebounded by the Rockets, 48-25. They allowed 24 second chance points compared to their 10, and 16 fastbreak points compared to their 11.\n\nTuesday’s loss against the Phoenix Suns was the first time this season that the Lakers had lost consecutive games. Redick had vowed that the Lakers would have the right mentality on Christmas, but that was not the case. The Lakers’ next opportunity to get back in the win column is Sunday, Dec. 28 as the Sacramento Kings come to town.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick was not in a charitable mood after the team’s 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day.\n\nThe team took its third straight loss Thursday in a one-sided affair, an outcome made worse by rising star Austin Reaves exiting the game with another calf injury. The Rockets led by double-digits for the entire second half and outrebounded the Lakers 48-25.\n\nAfter the game, Redick railed against his team’s effort level and bluntly assessed how it performed:\n\n“The two words of the day were ‘effort’ and ‘execution.’ I feel like when we’ve done both of those things at a high level, we’ve been a good basketball team. When we haven’t, we’re a terrible basketball team. And tonight, we were a terrible basketball team.”\n\nHe went on to note the team’s next practice Saturday will not be a fun one for certain players, whose consistency he is directly questioning:\n\n“We don’t care enough right now. That’s the part that bothers me a lot. We don’t care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don’t care enough to be professional.\n\nIt’s a matter of making the choice, and too often we have guys that don’t want to make that choice. It’s pretty consistent who those guys are. Saturday’s practice, I told the guys, it’s going to be uncomfortable. Meeting is going to be uncomfortable. I’m not doing another 53 games like this.”\n\nThat choice calls back to what Redick said after the Lakers’ previous loss to the Phoenix Suns, in which he painted the team’s defensive effort as a series of choices it wasn’t making correctly.\n\nHis full postgame conference Thursday:\n\nJJ Redick went scorched earth on the Lakers postgame. pic.twitter.com/ZLuOKyqMBQ\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) December 26, 2025\n\nThe Lakers have spent nearly the entire season on solid footing despite LeBron James’ early season absence, but now sit at 19-10, good for only fifth place in the Western Conference. The team can only hope Reaves isn’t further injured after missing three games last week with a calf strain, but it has other problems to figure out now.\n\nThe Lakers’ next chance to get back on track will be a Sunday home game against the Sacramento Kings, who currently hold the worst record in the West at 7-23.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Something has to change with the Lakers.\n\nThat was the feeling most Lakers fans had as they exited Crypto.com Arena early on Christmas, hoping to beat traffic after a third straight blowout loss. It was a sentiment echoed loudly by Lakers coach JJ Redick after the final buzzer and one likely to be shared by general manager Rob Pelinka soon enough.\n\n“We don’t care enough right now,” Redick said. “That’s the part that bothers you a lot. We don’t care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don’t care enough to be professional. We don’t care enough to be professional.”\n\n“It’s a matter of making the choice, and far too often we don’t have guys who want to make that choice,” Redick added while previewing the team’s next practice. “And it’s pretty consistent who those guys are. Saturday’s practice, I told the guys, is going to be uncomfortable. The meeting is going to be uncomfortable. I’m not doing another 53 games like this.”\n\nJJ Redick went scorched earth on the Lakers postgame. pic.twitter.com/ZLuOKyqMBQ\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) December 26, 2025\n\nFor a franchise that entered the season believing it had solved its championship formula, Christmas offered a brutal reality check.\n\nThe NBA trade deadline is February 5, 2026 — 41 days from the moment the Lakers exited the court Thursday following a 119–96 loss to the Houston Rockets. It marked their longest losing streak of the season, a stunning reversal for a team that hadn’t even lost consecutive games before last Saturday.\n\nThat night, the Clippers handed them a 103–88 loss. On Tuesday, the Phoenix Suns obliterated them 132–88. On Thursday, the Rockets delivered the third punch of a six-day stretch that has reframed the Lakers’ season and exposed their ceiling.\n\nThis is not a championship team as currently constructed.\n\nYes, they started 15–4 and looked like a contender through 19 games. But as Stan Van Gundy told me at the NBA Cup, numbers eventually win every argument.\n\n“I don’t think they’re a true contender, in my opinion,” Van Gundy said  “Their numbers said they were mediocre. Their record said they were really good. I just don’t think in today’s game they have enough.”\n\n“They don’t have the depth, they don’t have the speed and quickness to keep up right now,” Van Gundy continued. “Defensively, they even get weaker when their three best players play together.”\n\nHe was referring to the Lakers’ high-usage trio — Luka Dončić, LeBron James, and Austin Reaves — a combination that has repeatedly failed to defend young, fast, perimeter-driven teams. Against Houston, those stars once again shared the floor alongside starters Deandre Ayton and Rui Hachimura. The result was predictable.\n\nThe Lakers’ starting lineup was a -14 in just over eight minutes in the first half with a defensive rating of 144.4. Entering the game, that unit posted a 113 offensive rating, 122 defensive rating, and a -9 net rating this season.\n\n“When they had the mix of two of those guys (they were better).” Van Gundy said of the Lakers when they played without one of their stars. “Now JJ will obviously rotate those guys, but they’re going to come down the stretch in games, and those three guys are all going to be out there and Ayton will be out there and now you can’t get perimeter defenders out there with them. I think it’s a struggle and JJ and his staff have a huge challenge in front of them.”\n\nJames' Rich Paul said it first when he claimed the Lakers weren't a contender on his podcast two weeks ago. Van Gundy validated it. And the last 72 hours have cemented it.\n\nThe Lakers are 19–10 — fifth in the West, just ahead of the Rockets and the Suns, two teams that dismantled them. National hype can cloak flaws for only so long. The Lakers’ fatal flaw is now their defining one:\n\nThey cannot defend young, fast teams, and no team wins in the postseason giving up 120 points a night.\n\nThe Lakers don’t need another superstar. They have that box checked with Dončić. They still get All-NBA moments from LeBron. They’ll likely send Reaves to his first All-Star Game. But stars without an identity — without depth, speed, or defensive toughness — are just names on a marquee, not threats in a playoff series.\n\n“I can’t picture them on OKC’s level,” Van Gundy said. “Denver, San Antonio, Houston are probably the next three teams, and I don’t see the Lakers at that level.”\n\nThe good news? There’s still time for Pelinka to fix what ails them. The bad news? Time is the only thing they have. And if urgency, pride, and professionalism don’t arrive soon, it won’t matter who sits in uncomfortable practices or who speaks into a microphone next.\n\nThe Lakers’ biggest issue isn’t schematic, roster-based, or philosophical.\n\nIt’s effort. It’s identity. It’s caring enough.\n\nAnd right now, they simply don’t.",

    "description": "Here are three reasons why the Lakers were thrashed on Christmas Day.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets celebrated Christmas in style, delivering an overwhelming and dominant outing in a 119-96 thrashing of the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday.\n\nAmen Thompson led six Rockets in double figures with 26 points in the win, which ended a brutal six-game road trip — three overtime losses plus a 20-point blowout at the hands of the woeful Clippers — on a strong note to improve to 18-10 on the season. Luka Dončić scored a team-high 25 points for the Lakers, but also committed six of their 16 turnovers in a game L.A. never led, and in which Dončić, LeBron James and Co. only briefly even appeared competitive.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the Rockets’ commanding performance at Crypto.com Arena:\n\nAfter consecutive blowout losses to the Clippers and Suns, L.A. head coach JJ Redick offered a curt reply to an inquiry as to whether his Lakers — who entered Christmas ranked 25th in defensive efficiency — had shown enough of a willingness to dig in and grind it out on the less glamorous end of the floor:\n\nReporter: \"Does this group have enough guys who make the choice to play hard (like many guys on Phoenix eg. Goodwin)?\"\n\nJJ Redick: \"No.\"\n\n— Lakers Daily (@LakersDailyCom) December 24, 2025\n\nL.A. brought a similar flavor of indifference for much of its Christmas Day matchup with Houston. The Lakers repeatedly allowed Rockets ball-handlers to beat them at the point of attack, get into the paint and generate good look after good look, seemingly whenever and wherever they wanted:\n\nAmen Thompson with the speedy layup and then the Alley-oop dunk off a lob by Alperen Sengun (with a replay) pic.twitter.com/bVKRE8aCr0\n\n— MrBuckBuck (@MrBuckBuckNBA) December 26, 2025\n\nHouston barely needed five minutes of game time to build a double-figure lead that it would never relinquish, ending the opening frame with 37 points on 24 possessions — a torrid 154.2 offensive rating. For reference, the best offense in the NBA, the Denver Nuggets, scores 125.6 points-per-100.\n\n“The two words of the day were ‘effort’ and ‘execution,’” Redick said after the game. “I feel like when we’ve done both of those things at a high level, we’ve been a good basketball team, and when we haven’t, we’re a terrible basketball team. And tonight, we were a terrible basketball team. And that started, legitimately, right away.”\n\nWhen the Lakers briefly made a push midway through the second quarter, cutting the deficit to four at 48-44 following 3-pointers by Dončić and Jarred Vanderbilt, the Rockets calmly stuck to their guns, scored 15 points in the next three minutes and pushed the lead back to 10 at halftime. After the Rockets opened the third quarter with buckets on four straight possessions, Redick shifted tactics and dialed up a zone, which resulted in a pair of stops … which Houston promptly rendered irrelevant by grabbing offensive rebounds, scoring second-chance points and extending its lead even further.\n\nRedick rifled through his Rolodex in search of different combinations that might offer a level of physicality and defensive activity that could short-circuit Houston’s smoothly operating machine. The combo of Vanderbilt and Marcus Smart helped key an 11-4 second-quarter run that constituted L.A.’s best basketball of the night; a unit flanking Dončić and whisper-quiet center Deandre Ayton with Vanderbilt, Smart, gap-plugging connector Jake LaRavia (one that had played just 10 possessions together all season prior to Thursday) showed intermittent sparks.\n\nFor the most part, though, the Lakers’ Christmas fizzle looked remarkably similar to their Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals loss to the San Antonio Spurs: a team top-heavy with scoring skill but light on size, athleticism and defensive steel proving unable — or unwilling — to hang with a younger, stronger, more physical and more relentless opponent.\n\n“We don’t care enough right now,” Redick said. “That’s the part that bothers you a lot. We don’t care enough to, like, do the things that are necessary. We don’t care enough to be a professional. We had it. We had it. I always say this about culture, I always say this about a team being a functioning organism: It can change like that. We don’t have it right now.”\n\nWhat the Lakers do have, in Dončić, James and Austin Reaves (who sat out the second half with what the Lakers called left calf soreness, a worrying note considering he just missed three games with a calf strain) is enough high-end scoring and playmaking to produce a top-flight offense. If they can’t provide a higher class of resistance against similarly skilled opponents, though, that won’t be enough — especially not if the goal is to make a deep postseason run in this Western Conference.\n\n“It’s a matter of making the choice, and too often, we have guys who don’t want to make that choice,” Redick said. “And it’s pretty consistent who those guys are. I told the guys: Saturday’s practice is going to be uncomfortable. The meeting is going to be uncomfortable. I’m not doing another 53 games like this.”\n\nComing into Christmas Day, the Rockets were the NBA’s sixth-best team at winning the possession battle on a night-to-night basis, according to analysis by Jared Dubin at Last Night in Basketball, averaging three more offensive trips per game than their opponents. They pressed that advantage early and often Thursday, pulling down four offensive rebounds against some lackadaisical Lakers boxouts and forcing six turnovers in the first quarter alone.\n\nThat allowed them to take five more shots than L.A. in the opening stanza — a key factor in the Rockets opening that early double-digit lead and keeping the Lakers at arm’s length.\n\n17 offensive rebounds for Houston — an obscene 55.6% offensive rebounding rate, per @cleantheglass — and 24 second-chance points. The Rockets do this to everybody, but the defensive rebounding just wasn't even close to good enough for the Lakers. pic.twitter.com/kGMysOf9Nr\n\n— Dan Devine (@YourManDevine) December 26, 2025\n\nThe Rockets finished with nearly as many offensive rebounds (17) as the Lakers had defensive rebounds (18) and monster edges in second-chance points (24-10), points off turnovers (23-11), points scored per possession in transition (1.33 to 1.13) and total field-goal attempts (90-77). Getting that many more bites at the apple, and capitalizing on them so effectively, is how the Rockets can shrug off 25 from Luka and the Lakers shooting 50.6% as a team overall — and how a Houston team that takes fewer 3-pointers per game than any other squad in the NBA can still boast one of the league’s most potent and efficient attacks.\n\nWhen they’re at their best, the Rockets come at you in waves on the offensive end. It’s Thompson (26 points on 12-for-19 shooting with five assists) repeatedly getting downhill into the paint, and Alperen Şengün (14 points, 12 rebounds, four assists) meanspiritedly pirouetting his way into all manner of infuriating flip shots and needle-threading drop-offs, and Kevin Durant (25 points on 8-for-14 shooting, eight assists) barely seeming to break a sweat as he gets to his preferred spots in the midrange or pops a trail 3 in an unsuspecting defender’s eye.\n\nWhen they’re really scary, it’s because those headliners have help: Jabari Smith Jr. (16 points on nine shots) drilling jumpers spotting up and running off pindowns, Reed Sheppard (13 points, 5-for-10 from the floor) snaking the pick-and-roll to get to CP3-style elbow pull-ups in rhythm, and Tari Eason — an absolute menace on both ends of the court, just fully Grinching it up — ripping and running and terrorizing.\n\n7 quick points for Tari Eason pic.twitter.com/rsnFfX1BBL\n\n— MrBuckBuck (@MrBuckBuckNBA) December 26, 2025\n\nAmen Thompson with the alley-oop dunk off a lob by Kevin Durant to put the Rockets up 22 (with replays) pic.twitter.com/25gOMqUmrY\n\n— MrBuckBuck (@MrBuckBuckNBA) December 26, 2025\n\nOn some nights, the lack of a proper half-court organizer of a point guard will rear its ugly head; on others, though, the sheer tonnage of Houston’s athleticism, ferocity and talent will dispense with any such concerns. On those nights, these Rockets can straight up run you out of your gym. Ask the Lakers. They can tell you all about it.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers’ losing streak continued with an NBA Christmas Day slate loss against the Houston Rockets.\n\nWith an opportunity to prove they are one of the top contenders in the Western Conference on the primetime stage, the Lakers fell flat. Shortly after the game wrapped up, the outspoken former NBA veteran Kendrick Perkins offered the Lakers a piece of his mind.\n\n“Again, the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka,” Perkins wrote on social media.\n\n“He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.”\n\nAgain the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka. He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.\n\n— Kendrick Perkins (@KendrickPerkins) December 26, 2025\n\nDoncic checked in for 34 minutes of action on Thursday night. He went 9-17 from the field and attempted seven shots from the charity stripe. Doncic scored a game-high of 25 points, while coming down with five rebounds, and producing seven assists.\n\nHe also turned the ball over six times, more than any other player involved, and finished the game as a minus-25.\n\nThe Lakers were blown out with a score of 119-96. With that loss, they dropped to three straight defeats. Now, the Lakers are 19-10 on the year, slipping to fifth in the Western Conference standings. The victory for Houston allowed the Rockets to pull within half a game of the Lakers.\n\nDoncic and the Lakers aren’t in panic mode, but it’s clear that the coaching staff is growing frustrated with the team’s lack of execution, especially on the defensive end. It’s something that JJ Redick shined a light on earlier this week after the Lakers lost to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn Thursday night, Redick surely didn’t hold back. After Doncic and the Lakers get a day off on Friday, they’ll be back on the practice court for what Redick describes as an “uncomfortable” practice and film session. The Lakers will get a chance to bounce back against the struggling Sacramento Kings on Sunday.\n\nBetween the public pressure from analysts such as Perkins—and the brutally honest assessment from Redick—Doncic and the Lakers have a lot riding on them over the next couple of days. A comfortable win over the Kings could help them get back on the right track. Soon, the hoops world will see how the Lakers respond.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES --- The effort and overall execution were nonexistent for the Los Angeles Lakers on Christmas Day, losing to the Houston Rockets 119-96 for Los Angeles' third straight loss, the highest losing streak of the season.\n\nThe Lakers have now lost three straight games for the first time this season, two of the losses being by over 20 points, as they drop to 19-10 with a fifth-place position standing in the West.\n\nCoach JJ Redick didn't hold back how he felt toward the team's lack of execution in the 23-point loss, a defeat that saw the Lakers give up 17 offensive rebounds that resulted in 24 second-chance points and not lead for a single moment of the game.\n\n“It’s because we don't care enough right now. That's the part that bothers me a lot. We don't care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don't care enough to be professionals,\" Redick said.\n\n\"The two words of the day were 'effort' and 'execution.' I feel like when we've done both of those things at a high level, we've been a good basketball team. When we haven’t, we're a terrible basketball team and tonight we were a terrible basketball team.\"\n\nThe Lakers immediately were on their heels to start the game, down double-digits and committing five turnovers within the first five minutes.\n\nThe Rockets' offense was clicking against a Lakers defense that couldn't find a stop in a stop-sign-making warehouse, with Houston hitting 10 of their first 16 shots and consistently crashing the paint for second-chance opportunities.\n\nThe Lakers got their closest within four points toward the end of the second quarter but Houston kept their push and closed the door shut the rest of the way (their biggest lead being 24) behind six Rockets finishing in double figures, with Kevin Durant (25 points) and Amen Thompson (26 points, seven rebounds, five assists) leading the way.\n\nLuka Dončić, who finished the game with 25 points (seven assists, five rebounds), showed he was a shell of himself in his return after missing L.A.'s last game. His return was welcomed by the Rockets pressuring him and trying to speed him up constantly 94 feet, scoring all his points in the first three quarters and going scoreless in the fourth.\n\n\"I don't know what has to change, but definitely something needs to change,\" Dončić said surrounding the team. \"We got to figure it out; that's the thing we have [to do]. Everybody got to talk about it. I know JJ said it's going to be uncomfortable. As it should be.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, the Lakers lost Austin Reaves before they could reach halftime. A calf injury, the same one that's been keeping him out of the rotation lately, led to an early exit for Reaves as he finished with 12 points in 14 minutes.\n\nLeBron James finished with 18 points (five rebounds) on seven-of-13 shooting.\n\nBefore their next game, on Sunday at home against the Kings, the Lakers will have a practice on Saturday and Redick confirmed it will be a practice that is not going to be comfortable following their biggest home loss of the season.\n\n\"It's a matter of making the choice and far too often we don't have guys who want to make that choice.\" Redick said, \"It's pretty consistent who those guys are.  Saturday's practice is going to be uncomfortable. I'm not doing another 53 games like this.\"",

That word hung in the locker room air,\n\nA concept as foreign as playoff hardware.\n\n\"We had it,\" Redick continued, his voice dropping low,\n\n\"This culture can change like that,\" he said, snapping just so.\n\nThe numbers are damning, the analytics clear,\n\nA 26-point swing in net rating—oh dear.\n\nWith Smart, they were +13.5, just humming along,\n\nWith James, they've plummeted, -13.1 dead wrong.\n\nThe Lakers were 15-4 in their first 19 games,\n\nThey played with connection; they played like bright flames.\n\nThen James returned, and the schedule grew tough,\n\nNow 4-6 in ten games—is that enough?\n\n\"Is the care factor coachable?\" one reporter inquired,\n\n\"Or is it something you either have or you're tired?\"\n\nRedick paused, considering the question's sharp edge,\n\n\"Guys say they want to win,\" he said, standing on the ledge.\n\n\"The care factor is: do I care enough to do what I'm supposed to?\"\n\nRedick spoke of championship habits, of being closely attuned.\n\n\"That's what we don't have right now,\" Redick said, plain as day,\n\n\"And it's pretty consistent who those guys are,\" in a tone that betrayed.\n\nTheir defense was 14th before James' return,\n\nNow 25th and falling, a concern that burns.\n\nThis team held under 100—the Bucks, in a win,\n\nJames played sub-10 minutes; the lesson sinks in.\n\nThe body language told stories that box scores can't capture,\n\nA shrug, a half-jog, a laugh with the opposition's rapture.\n\nWhile Redick screamed rotations, while fans screamed dismay,\n\nJames seemed to whisper, \"It's just another day.\"\n\n\"We practice them all the time,\" Redick said of his schemes,\n\n\"It's a matter of making the choice,\" he said in a shattering of dreams.\n\n\"Too often we have guys that don't want to make that choice,\"\n\nRedick's voice was a scalpel; his words had a voice.\n\n\"Saturday's practice,\" Redick warned, \"will be uncomfortable.\n\nThe meeting will be uncomfortable. I'm not doing another 53 games like this.\"\n\nThe coach at his wits' end, a season on the brink,\n\nA roster of talent, yet unable to think.\n\nMarcus Smart spoke of leadership, of leading by example,\n\n\"Putting my body on the line,\" Smart said, ample.\n\nBut who follows? Who listens? Who makes the hard choice?\n\nWhen the star of the show uses his aged, selective voice?\n\nThe Rockets were 7-7 on the road, now improved,\n\nThe Lakers were exposed, their problems removed.\n\nFrom the shadows of \"potential\" and \"we'll be fine soon,\"\n\nInto harsh Christmas daylight, beneath a December moon.\n\nAustin Reaves left at halftime, a calf strain again,\n\n12 points in 16 minutes, then gone from the din.\n\n\"Not my decision,\" Redick said of the medical call,\n\nBut the fragility showed—they could not afford to fall.\n\nYet fall they did, and fall they keep falling,\n\nA team that once soared is now merely crawling.\n\nThe answer isn't straightforward; both require nuance,\n\nThe defense will be bad, with or without James' entrance.\n\nBut the offense was balanced when James was the third option,\n\nOnce his usage increased, the team lost its traction.\n\nJames picks and chooses his moments on D,\n\nWhile teammates stand static, failing to see.\n\nThe greatest present James could give, some fans dare to say,\n\nIs James waiving his no-trade clause and going away.\n\nThe greatest gift the Lakers could give, in return,\n\nIs youth and assets, for the fifth title King James yearns.\n\nBut Christmas comes in miracles, through hope and for cheer,\n\nNot in radioactive locker rooms, and indeed, not through fear.\n\nYet here stand the Lakers, tradition in tow,\n\nTheir 52nd Christmas game, and 27th blow.\n\nJared Vanderbilt flashed, and Smart showed some fight,\n\nBut rotations are fickle, your stars aren't quite right.\n\nThe problem is bigger than one man's plus-minus,\n\nIt's systemic, it's cultural, it's all of us.\n\nThe Rockets scored 119, the Lakers just 96,\n\nA 23-point margin, a holiday fix.\n\nThe fans left early, the stadium cleared,\n\nAnother Christmas ruined, another loss leered.\n\n\"We've got to be better,\" Smart said, simple and true,\n\n\"Stuff like that can't happen,\" of course, Smart knew.\n\nBut knowing and doing are different beasts,\n\nOne requires thought, the other, release.\n\nSo 'twas the night of Christmas, in Lakerland gloom,\n\nA season once promising is now facing doom.\n\nThe questions hang heavy, the answers seem far,\n\nWho are these Lakers? Who are they, these stars?\n\nA team with no energy, a team with no fight,\n\nA team that once dazzled now fades into the night.\n\nThe desert revealed them, the Rockets exposed,\n\nThe truth is now out there; the door is now closed.\n\nYet doors can reopen, can swing both ways,\n\nCan welcome the morning, can brighten the days.\n\nBut first must come honesty, hard choices made,\n\nChampionship habits cannot be outweighed.\n\nThe Lakers have talent, the Lakers have names,\n\nBut talent alone wins no playoff games.\n\nIt takes five guys moving; it takes trust and belief.\n\nIt takes caring enough to embrace the complicated grief.\n\nSo on this December night, as the chill falls on nowhere,\n\nAs palm trees stand silent beneath the thick air,\n\nThe Lakers face Christmas with coal in their socks,\n\nA team that must look in the mirror and talk.\n\nAbout who they are, about what they will be,\n\nAbout giving effort, about setting free\n\nThe potential they've bottled, the promise they've sold,\n\nBefore this whole season turns purple to mold.",

    "description": "Coach JJ Redick says the Lakers will not make all the correct choices, but \"can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.\"",
    "fullText": "It’s not the lineups, the injuries or necessarily the system. The cause of the Lakers' defensive demise is a thousand little decisions gone wrong.\n\n“It comes down to just making the choice,” coach JJ Redick said after the Lakers gave up 132 points in a blowout loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday. “It's making the choice. There's shortcuts you can take or you can do the hard thing and you can make the second effort or you can sprint back or you can't. It's just a choice and there's a million choices in a game, and you're very likely not gonna make every choice correctly. But can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.”\n\nComing off back-to-back losses for the first time this season, the Lakers (19-9) are ranked 28th in defensive rating in the last 14 games entering a Christmas Day showcase against the Houston Rockets at 5 p.m. PST at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers, without any individual shutdown defenders, need a perfectly executed team defense to compete. But 15 different starting lineups in 28 games has delayed some of the team's ability to build continuity. The Lakers have had their full complement of 14 standard contract players for two games.\n\nForward Rui Hachimura (groin) and Luka Doncic (leg) could return Thursday. Guard Gabe Vincent, one of the team’s top defensive options on the perimeter, will miss his fourth game with lower-back soreness. Center Jaxson Hayes tweaked his left ankle in the second quarter of Tuesday’s loss and didn’t return.\n\nThe Rockets (17-10) limp into the Christmas Day blockbuster with their own struggles. The team thought to be one of the few who could challenge Oklahoma City in the West has lost five of its last seven games. Three of the losses were in overtime and four came against teams currently out of the play-in picture, including Tuesday’s loss to the Clippers.\n\nLed by Kevin Durant’s 25.2 points, the Rockets are a statistical anomaly in the sped up, possession-maximizing modern NBA. They have the third-ranked offense in the league despite being one of the slowest. They shoot the fewest three-pointers per game, but make them at a 40% clip that ranks second, and dominate the glass with NBA-leading 48.7 rebounds and 16.1 offensive rebounds per game.\n\nHouston’s physicality and expertise on the boards could be especially worrisome for a team that still has to consciously choose defense on a possession-by-possession basis instead of consistently living up to a standard of playing hard.\n\n“There's really no defense, no scheme we can do when we're giving up offensive rebounds in crucial moments like we are, our [opponents] are getting wherever they want on the court,” guard Marcus Smart said after Tuesday’s loss. “And there's no help, there's no resistance, there's no urgency. … It's on us.”\n\nThe Suns grabbed 12 offensive rebounds against the Lakers on 35 missed shots, an offensive rebounding rate of 34.3%. After the Suns scored a three-pointer by twice grabbing offensive rebounds off tipped balls, Lakers players had an animated discussion in a timeout with Smart was gesturing toward center Deandre Ayton about tipping rebounds. Ayton, who finished with 10 rebounds and 12 points, and Smart ended the timeout with a high-five.\n\n“[I need to] just continue to talk to guys, even though sometimes they might not want to hear it,” said Smart, a free-agent addition the Lakers coveted for his leadership and tenacity on defense. “Especially when we losing, nobody wants to hear it, myself included, but also understand that it's integral for us to hear those things, to see and to be able to talk to one another and figure it out as players on the court, because we're the ones out there.”\n\nRedick intentionally built in moments for players to connect and communicate during every timeout this season before coaches speak. The strategy was meant to encourage players to take a larger leadership role. “Championship communication” was one of the team’s three pillars.\n\nAlong with “championship shape,” Redick also asked his team to build “championship habits.” Living up to the mantras is easier said than done.\n\n“It's not the easy choice,” Redick said. “It's human nature. … We do it on a daily basis. We make easy choices cause it's comfortable. Comfortable doesn't win.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

In addition to Doncic, LeBron James will be available for the Lakers, and he’ll face off against a familiar foe in Kevin Durant.\n\nThat duo will combine to make some NBA history when they take the floor on Christmas. The pair has scored a total of 73,630 points in the league, which represents the most combined points in a head-to-head matchup ever.\n\nThe holiday matchup between L.A. and Houston will be the first of three meetings between the two teams on the season.

However, the team could use an additional boost to strengthen its roster.\n\nFanSided's Josh Cornellisen has proposed a blockbuster trade between the Lakers, Clippers, and the Brooklyn Nets that would pair Kawhi Leonard with Luka Doncic and LeBron James.\n\nClippers receive: Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, Gabe Vincent, 2030 first-round pick swap (LAL)\n\nNets receive: Maxi Kleber, Dalton Knecht, 2032 Lakers second-round pick.\n\nSeveral superstars could be on the move, notably Anthony Davis and Giannis Antetokounmpo. However, it's not hard to see the Clippers moving on from Leonard if things continue to get worse.  The Clippers are currently one of the worst teams in the Western Conference, with a record of 8-22 on the season.\n\nThe Clippers could opt out of the Leonard contract, which has three years remaining and is worth $149 million, sending him to a Lakers team looking to compete for a top spot in the Western Conference by adding Leonard, giving them another dynamic scorer to pair with James and Doncic.\n\nParting ways with Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, and Gabe Vincent, along with the Lakers' first-round pick swap, sending them to the Clippers, helping them kick off a rebuild.\n\nDespite injuries throughout his career, Leonard has shown he can still play at a high level. Adding him to a Lakers team that currently has the worst defense in the NBA would make them a more complete and competitive squad.\n\nThe Lakers are rolling out a potential lineup that includes Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, and LeBron James, giving them one of the most versatile starting lineups in basketball.",

To make matters worse, Luka Doncic sustained a leg contusion during that game and was ruled out for the second half. Without so many key players, the Lakers had a huge lack of offensive firepower and lost 103-88 to the Clippers.\n\nHead coach JJ Redick said that he hopes Hachimura will be back after missing a total of only a few days.\n\nJJ Redick says Rui Hachimura, out tonight with a sore groin, started to feel discomfort in his hip in the UTA game.

With Rui Hachimura and Deandre Ayton sidelined, Jake LaRavia entered the starting lineup.\n\nAlthough the fourth-year forward posted a double-double with 12 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, he continues to struggle from beyond the arc.\n\nLaRavia shot 0-for-4 from deep in what has been an inefficient shooting season. His 30.5% from deep is a career-low, after averaging a career-high 42.3% from beyond the arc last season.\n\nFollowing the game, LaRavia spoke on his shooting struggles, expecting to get back on track soon.  “I know I’m a good shooter, everyone on the staff knows I’m a good shooter, everyone on the team knows I’m a good shooter,” LaRavia said. “At some point, I have to make shots. Obviously, been in a slump pretty much this entire season outside of that first stretch of games where I was making some. But they’ll drop.”\n\nFor Los Angeles, they'll need LaRavia to step up, especially if Luka Doncic is sidelined for an extended period. Even when Los Angeles is fully healthy, 34.3% from deep isn't a recipe for success in the modern NBA.\n\nIn addition to LaRavia, role players like Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent and Dalton Knecht will be relied upon to knock down threes in support of Doncic, LeBron James and Austin Reaves.\n\nThe Lakers will return to action Tuesday against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nFormer NBA Champion reveals he nearly signed with the Lakers\n\nDylan Harper shares his thoughts after crushing NBA Cup defeat\n\nKnicks' Karl-Anthony Towns makes classy gesture after NBA Cup victory\n\nPat Riley nearly paired Dwayne Wade with Allen Iverson\n\nDanny Wolf's stock continues to rise\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is lighting it up in the month of December",

Clippers center Ivica Zubac went to the ground in the first quarter and instantly limped back to the locker room with what was described as an ankle injury.

He’s averaged 1.6 steals and 0.7 blocks during his five NBA seasons. He would give the Lakers an aggressive defender who can match up with guards at the point of attack.\n\nJones has been a key member of the Pelicans’ rotation since his rookie year in 2021. He’s averaging 10.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and shooting 40.3% from the field this season. He’s also been a reliable 3-point shooter, shooting 33.7% this season and 36.2% for his career.\n\nHe only played 20 games last season due to a posterior labrum tear in his right shoulder. He’s already matched that total this season but missed around a week in November with a calf strain.\n\nJones is set to make $13.9 million this season and signed a three-year, $67.58M extension with the Pelicans last summer. The Lakers have limited future draft picks and cap space. Their 2031 unprotected first round pick could be enticing to the Pelicans, who could look to retool their roster around their rookies.",

    "fullText": "Lakers face Luka Doncic-LeBron James crossroads after JJ Redick's latest on-court experiment originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers pulled off one of the most groundbreaking trades just before the deadline last February. Acquiring Luka Dončić was one of the most shocking deals in NBA history. While the Lakers want to build around him—and understand that it may take time—Dončić still wants to win now.\n\n“Dončić being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn't mean they can slow down and take their time. Dončić told Lakers president Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick in May that he's not interested in taking the slow approach in building a contender,” CBS Sports’ Jasmyn Wimbish wrote.\n\nLos Angeles got off to a hot start, but lately the team has become stagnant. Defense has been a major reason for that struggle. As a result, head coach JJ Redick reportedly called a meeting with Dončić and LeBron James, challenging them to step up on that end of the floor.\n\n“It was good. We talked about a lot - not just that. But he was right. You got to get a little bit more, especially from the star players. So that’s on us, that’s on me.” - Luka Dončić on JJ Redick’s recent meeting where he asked for more on the defensive end from him and LeBron,” Lakers insider Dave McMenamin posted.\n\nIt also appears that Redick is working to get Dončić more involved off the ball.\n\n“JJ just inferred that he's been trying to get Luka to play more off-ball, but he's been reluctant and uncomfortable. However he made some progress in that regard today. If Luka learns how to play off-ball, even a 10% increase would make the Lakers so much more dangerous,” Lakers Daily posted.\n\nWhile getting Dončić involved off the ball could benefit the offense, it may also signal that Redick is still searching for the best way to keep all of his stars engaged. LeBron James has yet to have a truly dominant game, and that could be due in part to not having the ball in his hands as often.\n\nRedick now appears to be at a crossroads as he works to maximize his roster. This is his current solution, but if Dončić is unwilling to fully embrace the change, the offense could suffer. If these issues aren’t addressed soon, they could quickly become a significant problem.",

    "description": "Jarred Vanderbilt sparked the Lakers' defensive effort in the win over Phoenix on Sunday, but they'll need their stars to contribute as well against Utah.",
    "fullText": "They saw how “contagious” it was when playing defense at a high level against the Suns and how Jarred Vanderbilt lit the fuse to ignite things for the Lakers in their last victory over Phoenix.\n\nAnd for the Lakers to maintain that defensive mindset, stars Luka Doncic and LeBron James also have to be committed to that end of the court.\n\nThat was the message from Lakers coach JJ Redick to Doncic and James.\n\n\"Yeah, it was good,\" Doncic said. \"We talked about a lot, not just that, but he was right. You got to get a little big more, especially from the star players. So that's on us. That's on me. And we just got to give more, especially at the start of the game. We got to start the game better. But I think in Phoenix, we did a pretty good job. The plan was focused on ourselves and [our] defensive mentality, so I think we did a pretty good job.\"\n\nThe Lakers will be tested again on defense by the Utah Jazz Thursday night in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Jazz have a developing star in Lauri Markkanen, a difficult matchup at 7-foot-1 who is ninth in the NBA in scoring at 27.8 points per game, and a young talent in guard Keyonte George, who is averaging 23.5 points and 6.8 assists.\n\nUtah is fourth in the league in pace (102.98), ninth in scoring (119.0), second in assists (29.8). The Jazz are fifth in rebounds (45.7), eighth in offensive rebounds (12.6), and 12th in field-goal percentage.\n\n\"The way we play, we got to approach every game the same,\" Doncic said. \"In the NBA, every team is dangerous, so at some point somebody can go for 40. They have Markkanen, and then George. They can go for 40 on any night. So we just got to work on ourselves and approach the game, make everything the same.\"\n\nThe all-out energy and effort by Vanderbilt off the bench was the catalyst for the Lakers against the Suns.\n\nIn his 15 minutes of action, he had seven ponits, seven rebounds, two steals and one blocked shot.\n\nVanderbilt had played only three minutes and eight seconds over a 10-game stretch prior to that point.\n\n“Vando's minutes were huge,” Gabe Vincent said. “He came in and does what we all know he's very capable of doing and being disruptive on the defensive end, crashing the glass, getting extra possessions for us, all of which we desperately needed. You know what I mean? So his spark off the bench was huge for us.\"\n\nNow it’s about sustaining that defensive intensity, the Lakers say. And about playing with that physicality, the Lakers say.\n\n“Yeah, when you guys asked me this the last time, it’s effort,” Jake LaRavia said. “If we just go out there and we give that kind of effort every night…We got a lot of guys on the team. Some guys might not be having it and, like you said about that contagious word, that really helps out. (Marcus) Smart does it sometimes. Vando does it sometimes. I would say I do it just being a contagious type of person to help lead the team and just being extra physical.”\n\nThe Lakers are ranked near the bottom of the league in some defensive categories, which means there remains room for improvement.\n\nThey are ranked 17th in the league in points allowed (116.7), 24th in field-goal percentage (48.1%) allowed and 28th in three-point shooting (38.1%) allowed.\n\n“You just got to go out there and do it,” LaRavia said. “It’s not anything a coach can say. It’s not anything a player can tell another player. Yeah, it’s like the individual player’s job to go out there and give effort on defense and that’s contagious. It just goes around.”\n\nLakers center Deandre Ayton on Wednesday was named by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Assn. as the winner of the Bob Lanier Community Assist Award for November. Ayton was recognized for his philanthropic work across the Bahamas, which is his home country, Jamaica and Los Angeles through the Ayton Family Foundation.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Former NBA star Paul Pierce didn't hold back when he described the Lakers' poor decision-making in the final minutes of Sunday's win over the Suns.",
    "fullText": "Late in the third quarter of their Sunday matchup against the Phoenix Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers started to play the type of winning defense that their fans have been practically begging for. During a stretch of roughly 10 minutes that extended into the fourth quarter, they scored 24 unanswered points and forced seven turnovers, allowing them to take a 95-77 lead.\n\nHowever, after that outstanding spurt, the Lakers fell back into their old bad habits on both ends of the floor. They started to walk the ball upcourt and milk the shot clock, as if they were merely looking to conservatively protect their lead rather than build on it and hold off Phoenix. That behavior played right into Phoenix's hands, and they ended up having to pull out a 116-114 victory by the skin of their teeth after the Suns made a couple of big mistakes in the final seconds.\n\nIt was another reminder that the Lakers still have a lot of work to do in order to seriously contend for the NBA championship.\n\nHall of Famer Paul Pierce went off on them during a recent episode of the \"No Fouls Given\" podcast for the way they gave up their lead in the last several minutes of Sunday's game. He said the Lakers — and the Suns — had very poor basketball IQ in the final minutes of that contest, and that neither team will be able to win a playoff series this spring as a result.\n\n\"This was one of the lowest IQ, last four minutes I've seen from both teams this season. And based on what I saw, neither one of these teams can win a playoff series.\"\n\nOf course, the Lakers are likely not as reckless and undisciplined as they looked in the final minutes of Sunday's game, nor are they as good a defensive team as they looked during that 10-minute stretch late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter. They do have an 18-7 record, which gives them an elite winning percentage, and are in third place in the Western Conference.\n\nBut Los Angeles hasn't played the Denver Nuggets, Houston Rockets or New York Knicks yet, and when it faced the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder a month ago, it lost 121-92, albeit with LeBron James still out due to sciatica. Continuing to put forth the same ineptitude they displayed late in Sunday's game will almost certainly result in decisive losses against the Nuggets, Rockets, Knicks and especially the Thunder.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Paul Pierce on Lakers' basketball IQ in crunch time of Sunday's game",

Doncic is at 75%.\n\nThis season, it's more glaring. LeBron has made just 61.9% of his free throws. Doncic is at 81.1%.\n\nThe numbers all align on the same side: Doncic should take the techs, not James.\n\nSure, there's likely an urge to be the guy to take the foul shot yourself if you're the one who essentially draws the technical foul.\n\nBut in a close game, it makes more sense to have the guy who is more likely to make the foul shot take the foul shot.\n\nFor the Lakers, that's Luka and not LeBron.\n\nGoing forward, it's safe to expect L.A. to get this right.

Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nChariton Arnold Ferrin Jr. was a basketball star in college while at the University of Utah. In 1944, he was named the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA Tournament as the Utes won the national championship, and three years later, he helped the school win a National Invitation Tournament title.\n\nThe Lakers took Ferrin in the third round of the 1948 draft, and he spent three seasons in the NBA, with all of them coming as a member of the Lakers. He averaged 5.8 points and 1.6 assists a game during that time and won championships during both of his first two seasons in the league.\n\nAfter his NBA career ended, Ferrin had a short stint as the general manager of the American Basketball Association's Utah Stars in the 1970s, and afterward, he was the athletic director for the Utes from 1976 to 1985. During his time as athletic director, the Utes won a total of 10 national championships, including four NCAA titles in women's gymnastics.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 18 — Chariton Arnold Ferrin Jr.",

Austin Reaves, Maxi Kleber and Bronny James have all been ruled out of the game. Reaves, who has been a huge factor in L.A.'s early-season success, is expected to miss a week of action with a calf strain.\n\nMeanwhile, the Suns will be without Jalen Green and Isaiah Livers.

    "fullText": "Lakers predicted to cut ties with Luka Doncic's former $33 million Mavericks teammate originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt’s safe to say the Los Angeles Lakers will look a bit different by the time the Feb. 5 trade deadline passes.\n\nThe franchise has plenty of tradable assets it can use in a midseason deal to upgrade its roster. Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk is under the impression that Luka Doncic’s 6-foot-10 former Dallas Mavericks teammate is among the assets the Lakers will move on from this season.\n\n“The Golden State Warriors proved last season why it can be advantageous to make a move early,” Rovenchuk wrote Friday. “They acquired Dennis Schroder, gave the experiment a shot, and rerouted him in favor of eventually securing Jimmy Butler when the initial venture failed.”\n\n“If the Lakers were going to replicate a similar approach, there is one clear member of the roster who stands out as a part of the outgoing package for Los Angeles. That would be Maxi Kleber.”\n\n“Kleber has been sidelined recently, dealing with a lower back injury. With the Lakers struggling to find defense, athleticism, shooting, and bench scoring, any one of these needs could have him moved before even being given the opportunity to return to the court for Los Angeles.”\n\nWhile it may not be easy to believe, Kleber was once a valuable stretch four who played respectable pick-and-pop basketball alongside Doncic in Los Angeles.\n\nFast forward to the 2025-26 season, and Kleber, who was included in the blockbuster Feb. 2 trade that landed Doncic with the Lakers, is a low-impact contributor for JJ Redick’s crew.\n\nWhile Kleber is shooting 37.5% from three, he’s contributing just 1.8 points and 1.8 rebounds per game in 12.1 minutes, signaling that it may be time to part ways with the 33-year-old big man.\n\nIf one thing’s certain, Kleber is running out of time to prove himself in Los Angeles.\n\nMore NBA: Spurs' Stephon Castle makes basketball history never done ever before in NBA",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans are having one of the worst seasons in the NBA.\n\nThey could also be crucial to how the rest of the year plays out in the Western Conference.\n\nThat's because the Pels have two trade chips that are sought after by a lot of the league: Trey Murphy III and Herbert Jones.\n\nThe latest reporting from The Athletic's Sam Amick indicates that the Golden State Warriors are especially intrigued by Murphy, and that the Los Angeles Lakers really want Jones.\n\n\"For quite some time now, the Warriors have been open about their desire to acquire the Pelicans’ Trey Murphy III,\" Amick writes. \"But if they’re going to use Kuminga to do that, then it would be helpful to know how, if at all, the Pelicans value the Warriors’ 23-year-old forward. For the time being, the feedback is mixed on that front. ’Tis the season for smokescreens, after all.\"\n\nMORE: This Warriors news leak about a Draymond-Giannis trade is hilarious\n\nMurphy could be a part of the Pelicans' core alongside Derik Queen, if they want to go that route. It remains to be seen what they'll do with him.\n\nJones would cost a bit less in a trade, at least in concept.\n\n\"Our Lakers’ beat writer, Dan Woike, highlighted their interest in Jones this week,\" Amick writes. \"At the same time, he cited team and league sources who said the Pelicans are 'not interested' in moving Jones. Fair enough, but let’s circle back for a vibe check in late January.\"\n\nNew Orleans is already struggling. If the struggles only get worse, the Pelicans will have little choice but to consider trades to try to prop up their future, since their present doesn't appear to be going anywhere.\n\nThe Warriors and Lakers will be circling for that moment of opportunity to come.\n\nRich Paul makes the LeBron James trade plans clear\n\nWhy it's time for the Pelicans to move on from Zion\n\nThe Bucks have a looming $275 million Giannis problem\n\nTimberwolves want Coby White, but there's a catch",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nJeremy Lin took the NBA world by storm midway through the 2011-12 season when he moved into the New York Knicks' starting lineup and put together an extended stretch of big-scoring games. He had gone undrafted in 2010 out of Harvard University, not exactly a high-level basketball school, and was a seemingly invisible rookie with the Golden State Warriors, but he seemingly shot himself out of a cannon with New York.\n\nIt sparked a phenomenon people referred to as \"Linsanity,\" and even after the rest of the league adjusted to him and his production regressed to a more consistent mean, a sizable amount of the hype surrounding him remained.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the rebuilding Lakers acquired Lin in a trade with the Houston Rockets. By now, he was straddling the line between a low-tier starting point guard and a very solid reserve point guard. He played one season with the Lakers and started in 30 of 74 games while averaging 11.2 points and 4.6 assists in 25.8 minutes a game.\n\nHe left L.A. following that season and would have short stints with the Charlotte Hornets, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors before his NBA career ended. He finished with league career averages of 11.6 points on 43.3% field-goal shooting and 4.3 assists in 25.5 minutes a game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 17 — Jeremy Lin",

    "fullText": "The San Antonio Spurs are headed to the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, 132-119, on Wednesday, and might have Victor Wembanyama back in the lineup for the big tournament matchup. Following the team’s quarterfinal victory over the Lakers on Wednesday, Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson to reporters that Wemby might be ready to make his return from injury over the weekend.\n\n“Very much so,” coach Johnson said. “He had a really good day today. He had a very intense day this morning, and we’ll have to see how he responds or reacts (Thursday).”\n\nWemby went through an intense workout on Wednesday morning and then worked out again during pregame warmups before the Lakers game. He was able to get through that workout without any extra protection on his strained calf, according to Johnson.\n\nWembanyama has been sidelined with his calf strain and hasn’t played since Nov. 16. However, the Spurs have been able to get through this stretch and post a 9-3 record without their All-Star big man and defensive anchor. Wemby’s potential return couldn’t come at a better time as the Spurs will face the defending NBA Champion Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nIn Wembanyama's absence, other players like last season's Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle have had to step up even more to help carry the load. In Wednesday's win over the Lakers, Castle scored 30 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and dished 6 assists. De'Aaron Fox chipped in with 20 points, and Keldon Johnson scored 17 off the bench.\n\n“I think Victor would tell you we have a deep team, and we rely upon playing together as a team,” Johnson said. “He may be the biggest puzzle piece, but he needs everybody else to complete the puzzle.”\n\nAlthough Wemby has missed half of San Antonio’s 24 games this season, the Spurs are 17-7 overall and currently fifth in the Western Conference. When Wembanyama is on the court, he’s been as dominant as ever this season, averaging career-highs of 26.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, along with 3.6 blocks.\n\nSan Antonio and OKC square off in the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday, Dec. 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The NBA Cup championship game will be played on Dec. 16 in Las Vegas.",

    "fullText": "Any chance the Lakers had at trying to capture a second NBA Cup championship in the third season of the tournament evaporated for good in the fourth quarter against a young, fast and athletic San Antonio Spurs team missing its best player.\n\nThe Lakers won the inaugural NBA Cup title in 2023 and had designs on winning it again in 2025 and the $500,000 cash that goes to each player on the championship team.\n\nBut it was not to be — not with the Lakers unable to slow down the Spurs during a 132-119 quarterfinal loss Wednesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers got down by as much as 24 points in the fourth and made a run to get to within eight points late in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Lakers got no closer and now will face the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday.\n\nThe Spurs will meet the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in Las Vegas in the semifinals.\n\nLuka Doncic had 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists, Marcus Smart came off the bench to score 26 and LeBron James had 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. But that wasn’t enough against a Spurs team that had seven players score in double figures.\n\nStephon Castle led the Spurs with 30 points and De’Aaron Fox had 20.\n\nWhen the Lakers needed someone to lift them when they got down by 18 points in the second, someone to provide them a spark when there wasn’t one for so much of the quarter, they finally got it from the oldest player on the court, 40-year-old LeBron James.\n\nJames drove down the lane and threw down a thunderous dunk over Spurs 7-1 center Luke Kornet, bringing the Lakers to within eight points and charging up the crowd in the process.\n\nJames growled and yelled in the face of the reeling Kornet. The crowd stood and cheered, now happy that there was a Lakers’ awakening.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t hold on to that momentum, falling behind 70-58 at the half.\n\nAnd then when the third quarter started, the Lakers came out flat, giving up back-to-back threes and two more easy baskets for the Spurs to fall into an 80-60 hole early in the third.\n\nThe Lakers didn’t make it easy on themselves either.\n\nDoncic got a technical foul in the first quarter after no foul was called after Kelly Olynyk smacked him in the face and Lakers coach JJ Redick was called for a technical foul in the second quarter.\n\nWhen the Lakers last faced the Spurs a little over a month ago here, San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama played in a game L.A. won, but speedy point guard De’Aaron Fox did not.\n\nIt was the opposite this time, with Fox playing and Wembanyama out with a left calf strain.\n\nThe 7-5 Wembanyama has been out for almost a month and the super-quick Fox has been back during that time, which has changed the dynamic of the Spurs, which meant the Lakers had to shift how they played defense against San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs are more guard-oriented with Fox, Castle and Dylan Harper.\n\nThe Lakers got a taste of how much faster the Spurs are now in the first quarter, when L.A. gave up 39 points and trailed by nine after the first frame.\n\nThe Spurs show 56% from the field in the first, 50% (six-for-12) from three-point range.\n\nKeldon Johnson came off the bench to score 13 points in the first quarter for the Spurs.\n\n\"Yeah, they're running a lot of pick and rolls with Fox, a lot of pick and rolls with Castle and Harper,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said pregame about the Spurs’ new way of playing. “And all those pick and rolls lead to drives, those pick and rolls lead to kick-outs and catch two threes and then more drives. So, we've got to do a good job of containing the basketball and do a good job of contesting.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",
