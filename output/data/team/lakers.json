Bufkin has starred for L.A.'s South Bay affiliate and now rejoins the Lakers in his third NBA season to fill their 15th roster spot. pic.twitter.com/Z1m3M4KvTM\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 8, 2026\n\nThe Michigan native has made a name for himself this season with impressive performances for the Lakers' South Bay G-League team. In 26 games for South Bay, Bufkin has averaged 26.7 points on 43% shooting from 3 and 51.3% overall.\n\nThis signing comes after Bufkin posted a career-high 41 points on Wednesday in South Bay's win over Capital City Go-Go, having 30 of those points in the first half after starting the game seven for seven from 3. In the previous game, he started six for six from deep.\n\nBufkin gives the Lakers another 3-point weapon off the bench for coach JJ Redick, as the team now has two new additions to the roster after trading for sharpshooting guard Luke Kennard — for Gabe Vincent and a 2032 second-round pick — on the last day of the trade deadline.\n\nBufkin has appeared in four games this season for the Lakers after signing a 10-day contract with the team on Jan. 13. In those games he averaged 3.0 points in 11.3 minutes.",

    "description": "Will it be Giannis Antetokounmpo or bust this summer for the Lakers?",
    "fullText": "The NBA's trade deadline came and went on Thursday with Giannis Antetokounmpo staying put on the Milwaukee Bucks' roster. That means that once this summer starts, he will be highly sought after once again, and perhaps this time, the attempts to trade for him will be very serious.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves, Miami Heat and New York Knicks are thought to be the three teams that have the best chances of landing the two-time MVP. Lurking in the shadows, despite a lack of players who will be attractive trade assets, are the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers will have plenty of salary cap space, as well as three tradable first-round draft picks (one of which is this year's first-rounder) this summer. But some fans may fear that the organization will be so fixated on Antetokounmpo that should it strike out on him, it will miss out on other trade targets, as well as free agents who could help it.\n\nAccording to Dan Woike of The Athletic, Los Angeles may be a little more flexible as far as how it goes about upgrading its roster.\n\n\"Team sources have maintained that the Lakers won’t pursue a single pathway. That’s the luxury of their position; they can and should pursue Antetokounmpo. They can and should explore high-level role players whom they can trade draft picks for and absorb into space. They can and should look into aggressive ways to pry loose one of the top restricted free agents.\"\n\nThis year's free agent class won't be impressive, but it will include Peyton Watson and Tari Eason, who are two-way forwards capable of bringing L.A. closer to championship contention. It could always make another attempt at trading for Trey Murphy III, another two-way forward whom it reportedly had interest in prior to the trade deadline. Or there could be another difference-maker who isn't on people's radars right now.\n\nThe Lakers could have over $50 million of salary cap space after the conclusion of this season. That would at least give them the ability to truly reshape their roster around and for Luka Doncic, even if fans lack confidence that general manager Rob Pelinka will be successful in doing so.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Sources: Lakers won't pursue 'single pathway' this summer",

    "fullText": "Two days after defeating the Capital City Go-Go, 124-111, the South Bay Lakers took the court at CareFirst Arena in the nation's capital again to face the Go-Go on Friday.\n\nThey were looking for their sixth win in seven games, but this game was more competitive than Wednesday's contest. On Wednesday, the Lakers were able to open up a big lead in the second quarter, but on Friday, neither team led by more than 10 points.\n\nSouth Bay went ahead 72-62 in the third quarter after being down by six points in the second quarter. But that 10-point lead quickly evaporated, and a couple of offensive miscues in crunch time resulted in a 115-114 loss for South Bay. The team allowed Capital City to shoot 45.5% from 3-point range, which offset the advantages it had in free throws and fast-break points.\n\nWhile Kobe Bufkin shot 5-of-13 from the field, he once again had a big scoring outing with 29 points. R.J. Davis scored 20 points and added seven rebounds and seven assists, and Arthur Kaluma contributed 25 points and nine rebounds off the bench.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: South Bay Lakers recap: G League Lakers lose close game to Go-Gos",

    "description": "The Sixers turned in another third-quarter meltdown to waste a good Joel Embiid performance, falling 119-115 to the Los Angeles Lakers in infuriating fashion. Here’s what I saw. Third quarter...",
    "fullText": "The Sixers turned in another third-quarter meltdown to waste a good Joel Embiid performance, falling 119-115 to the Los Angeles Lakers in infuriating fashion.\n\nJoel Embiid had just an okay game against the Clippers in Philadelphia’s barnstorming win on Monday, sitting out the second half of a back-to-back against Golden State the next night. It felt a little bit like he owed these guys something, if for no other reason than having the freshest pair of legs. And boy, did he deliver on that, sparking the Sixers early while playing a do-it-all hub on offense for a team that struggled to make shots for most of the night.\n\nWith the Lakers down Jaxson Hayes thanks to his mascot-related suspension — yes, he really is that big of a clown — DeAndre Ayton was the only guy close to like-sized that L.A. could throw at him. But it didn’t especially matter, outside of a few offensive rebounds Ayton pulled down at his expense. Ayton’s on-again, off-again effort is a bad matchup for an opponent who will take any bit of space and rise into a midrange jumper, and Embiid was able to get the shot going within the first five minutes of the game. When that happens, opponents are in jail trying to guard him, as it opens up opportunities to punish reach-ins and drive by jumpy defenders.\n\nOutside of Ayton, the Lakers mixed up coverages and the defender primarily tasked with guarding Embiid. From Jarred Vanderbilt to Maxi Kleber and others across the spectrum, the main theme was a big size advantage for Embiid. On some nights, that might mean deep post catches and a free-throw parade, but with Embiid often operating from the middle of a zone, it meant a lot of jumpers his man could never get close enough to contest. One little jab step, one little body language cue, and the Lakers were falling all over themselves to stay with him, with Embiid rising into lightly-contested shots for the entire first half. 20 easy points at halftime, thank you very much.\n\nEmbiid had some sloppiness with the handle early, but he was killing the Lakers as a playmaker for others, too, punctuating his first half with an outstanding play: Embiid faked a handoff attempt to Tyrese Maxey, drove downhill into the space the Lakers left vacated, and as the defense collapsed on him in the paint, he released the ball to Dominick Barlow for an easy bucket, sending the Sixers into halftime on a high note.\n\nEverything was rolling along until, you guessed it, the third quarter hit. I cannot believe we are this far into the season and still treating the quarter after halftime as an unsolvable Sphinx riddle for the Sixers to solve. Change the opponent, the venue, the players on the floor, nothing really matters. They will find a way to stink it up all the same.\n\nThere was a decided lack of seriousness from the Sixers after they surged to a double-digit lead early in the third, allowing the Lakers to get back into the game with seven turnovers in a single quarter. They were mostly in cruise control until about the halfway point of the third, and then the wheels came off. Nurse resisted turning to his bench as the Sixers held onto a small but mildly comfortable lead, and it all came crashing down in the end-of-quarter stretch, with Maxey battling foul trouble and Embiid resting on the bench.\n\nEnter Quentin Grimes, a mystifying player to watch. His first half was filled with genuinely awesome moments, with Grimes best understanding what needs to be done when Austin Reaves is on the floor. Drawing him in isolation repeatedly, Grimes went right by him to the rim on several different occasions, making Reaves work as he tore up the Sixers on the other end. He also put down his second highlight dunk of the week with a hellacious throwdown over Jake LaRavia, who I presume had a family.\n\nTELL THEM DON’T JUMP, Q!!! 💥🤯pic.twitter.com/K78SL0bJGp\n\n— PHLY Sixers (@PHLY_Sixers) February 6, 2026\n\nThe second half was what we will charitably refer to as an adventure. When Grimes checked into the game for his end-of-third minutes, the game almost immediately flipped in the wrong direction. He had a brutal turnover, a bad foul, and a miscommunication with VJ Edgecombe in quick succession, and the Lakers were surging. His first good play of that stretch, a steal near halfcourt, was nearly botched before order was restored, only for Kelly Oubre to launch a tightly-contested three with close to 20 seconds left on the shot clock. Not the time or the place, particularly when you’re 2/7 at the time, Mr. Oubre.\n\nThis was the first stretch of basketball over the last week where I felt they desperately needed Paul George. In those backup lineups where they try to buy rest for Embiid and Maxey, it tends to be George who emerges as a cooler head, attacking in isolation or offering spacing for VJ Edgecombe to attack in. With George in street clothes, we were back to early-season Sixers hoops, with the Edgecombe/Grimes/Watford/Oubre combo dying for some spacing, plus decision-making, and savvy.\n\nDown two points with 27 seconds left, the Sixers apparently decided they would trap late and concede a basket instead of either defending the play straight up or fouling to play the back-and-forth game. On the ensuing possession with 12 seconds left, Maxey took a ridiculous foul-baiting three and lost them the opportunity for even a chance to tie or win the game.\n\nOne of the dumbest sequences in Sixers history, straight up.\n\nVJ Edgecombe is what I would affectionately refer to as an all-action player, someone who rarely rests on his laurels who helps you win games no matter what the moment requires. Those guys can occasionally cross the line and go careening into the opponent, trying too hard to impact the game while it boomerangs back on them. But he is a rare breed of rookie, constantly playing with 100 percent effort while minimizing his wild moments on both ends of the floor.\n\nIn fact, Edgecombe often cleans up craziness from other players. Joel Embiid had the rare opportunity to throw him a lob on the break, tossing the ensuing pass so high that two VJ Edgecombes stacked on top of one another in a trenchcoat probably wouldn’t have reached the ball. But after making the attempt to meet it at the summit, Edgecombe collected himself quickly and saved it from going out of bounds, ultimately earning the Sixers an extra possession that ended with an Embiid midrange make. These plays are a constant in the Edgecombe experience.\n\nThe Lakers tried to dare the Sixers into beating them with the three-ball with a fair amount of zone, and Edgecombe was the only guy making outside shots to potentially get them out of it. He is slowly starting to figure out the happy medium on the break, darting through traffic for layups and dunks or slowing down to find an open shooter if those easy opportunities aren’t there. Edgecombe was one of their few solid options defending Austin Reaves, who gave L.A. a big lift off the bench, ripping him on a first-half possession before the Sixers got out and scored on the break.\n\nAt least, that was the case for the first half, because Edgecombe ran into a wall and struggled mightily in winning time for Philadelphia. He was a little too much gas without brakes, throwing up some wild attempts inside the arc with no whistles to save him. And even after he made a gigantic steal and hit a three and drew them within three, he and Grimes combined for one of the worst fouls of the season, fouling down three with 35 seconds left when a normal defensive possession would have sufficed.\n\nBut I was much more disappointed in Tyrese Maxey, who had an impactful passing game but a dire attacking performance, letting the Lakers dissuade him from getting past the initial defensive coverage while jacking missed three after missed three on stepback jumpers. Between true zone coverage and some extra bodies in the paint sagging off of questionable shooters, Maxey relied far too much on his jumper on a night where he had nothing going from deep.\n\nCould the Sixers have been more purposeful with their offense to get him rolling? I think so, yes. First play of the game, they ran him off of an Iverson cut to get him a look closer to the basket, and rarely turned to off-ball action to get him looks the rest of the night.\n\nIf not for the lack of incoming players at the trade deadline, we’d have a real opportunity to celebrate Dominick Barlow, who is one of the great organizational success stories of the last two years. Signed to a standard deal on Thursday evening, Barlow rose quickly from an end-of-bench afterthought to an essential piece of this Sixers team.\n\nIt has been a big road trip for Barlow, who brought his standard brand of energy and athleticism to the arena against L.A. One of the high notes of a solid Sixers first half was an end-to-end sequence from Barlow, who came from the weakside to block Rui Hachimura on a deep catch before streaking to the other end, finishing with style for two points after outrunning the entire Lakers team in transition.\n\nHis night was defined by work in and around the dunker spot, with Barlow catching drop-off after drop-off from every available passer.\n\n— In games where an opponent gets a whistle that seems ultra skewed against one team, my dad likes to shout to no one in particular, “It’s like playing the Globetrotters!” It certainly felt like the Harlem Lakers were on the floor on Thursday night.\n\n(All that said, the officials did not win this game for the Lakers. The Sixers happily gave this game away themselves. But Jenna Schroeder is the worst ref in the league and I don’t even think it’s close.)\n\n— That was perhaps the worst Oubre game of his Sixers tenure and a version of him I thought he largely left behind in Charlotte. Embarrassing shot selection, miserable off-ball defense, every negative trait in his profile on full display all at once.",

    "fullText": "Rivalries are the backbone of the NBA. Rivals Week just passed, but the lineup wasn’t up to par. Some fan-favorite matchups are missing, such as the Spurs and Thunder, or the historic Celtics and Lakers, built off the backs of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\n\nPlayer rivalries build team rivalries. Seeing players go head-to-head to prove who’s the best is what makes the NBA the most entertaining.\n\nWith that being said, here are the four best player rivalries currently taking place in the NBA:\n\nAnytime Lebron faces off with Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, it’s still a marquee matchup. LeBron, Durant, and Curry are a callback to an era now passed. Every time the NBA begins a new season, fans know they are that much closer to these show-stopping battles are coming to an end.\n\nThat means every game is a must-watch. When any combination of these three go head-to-head, it’s apparent how badly they each want to come out victorious over the other.\n\nFrom Finals matchups to random regular-season contests, each of the three give their all when they step on the court against each other.\n\nA different side of LeBron comes out when he faces Dillon Brooks. We’ve never seen a player get under the King’s skin like the Phoenix Suns guard. This rivalry has been filled with trash talk, physical confrontations, and heated moments.\n\nBrooks is averaging a career high of 21.1 points per game and elevates his play every time he goes up against the Lakers. Los Angeles’ last matchup with the Suns ended in a blowout.\n\nIt seems like Brooks has made it his personal mission to mess with the Hall of Famer, and fans are eagerly awaiting their next duel.\n\nChet Holmgren going up against Victor Wembanyama has been one of the NBA’s most compelling feuds as of late.\n\nSince Wembanyama entered the NBA, he and Chet have had a budding rivalry. The two towering figures first faced off in the 2021 FIBA World Cup, where Holmgren and Team USA walked out with the win.\n\nThe Spurs seem to have the Thunder’s number this year, as they’ve beaten them three times this season. It feels like Wembanyama circles every Thunder game on his calendar.\n\nWembanyama is on a mission to prove he’s far and away the best young center in the NBA. The Spurs’ phenom is a generational talent, but Holmgren has something he doesn’t: a championship ring.\n\nEdwards Vs. SGA is a heavyweight fight with the title for best guard in the NBA on the line. The intensity always reaches a fever pitch when these two play each other. The two players mirror each other in many ways. Both became leaders of their team at a relatively young age and became stars around the same time.\n\nAnt and SGA have taken subtle shots at each other through shoe commercials. It’s clear they both have immense respect for each other, but are fighting to be the best. The Timberwolves have won two out of three matchups with the Thunder this season, but these two will be battling it out for years to come.\n\nAttention player haters and disbelievers of all kinds… pic.twitter.com/5tzoBwvUZ4\n\n— adidas Basketball (@adidasHoops) October 24, 2025\n\nThe post What Are the Best Player Rivalries In the NBA Today? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James has offered a fascinating insight into how a legendary WWE heel turn helped shape one of the most controversial chapters of his NBA career.\n\nAfter all, the Los Angeles Lakers star explained that his time with the Miami Heat was influenced by an unlikely wrestling icon.\n\nJames’ decision to embrace the villain role after leaving Cleveland in 2010 transformed how fans viewed him, and he has since acknowledged that the reaction was not only anticipated but studied.\n\nSpeaking on a recent episode of the Mind the Game podcast, LeBron revealed that the late WWE legend Hulk Hogan played a key role in how he understood fame, backlash, and reinvention.\n\n“I grew up watching Hulk Hogan. At one point, Hulk Hogan was like America, as everyone loved him. What it means to be an American.\n\nThen one day, he went to N.W.O. and people couldn’t understand how he tagged up with the enemy,” James said.\n\nHe added: “They were like, ‘What is going on?’ Everybody just booed him. He went from wearing red and yellow to black and white.”\n\nHogan’s infamous switch from beloved hero to villain in the 1990s stunned wrestling fans and redefined his career.\n\nLeBron saw clear parallels when he joined forces with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, a move that instantly made him the league’s most polarising figure.\n\nLeBron explained that accepting the villain label was partly about understanding entertainment as much as competition.\n\n“One, we’re entertainers as well… Listen, we want to go out and have fun, smile and be happy because that’s what brings us joy,” James continued.\n\nHe concluded, stating: “But we can tap into the Joker role if y’all make us, now. We can get there too now, and still be able to perform at a high level.”\n\nDuring his Miami Heat years, James leaned into the boos, the black uniforms, and the perception that he was basketball’s ultimate antagonist.\n\nRather than fighting public sentiment, he channelled it. The result was one of the most dominant stretches of his career, with championships, MVPs, and a sharpened edge that defined a new version of LeBron.\n\nMuch like Hogan’s transformation elevated professional wrestling, LeBron’s embrace of the villain role reshaped the NBA’s modern era. It was controversial, deliberate, and ultimately successful.\n\nLeBron James sends message to Wesley Bryan while explaining his recent golf obsession\n\nDillon Brooks calls LeBron James NBA’s most overrated player to renew rivalry\n\nRich Paul claims LeBron James turned Cleveland into ‘Hollywood of the Midwest’",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAndrew Wiggins has received interest from several organizations this trade season.\n\nThe athletic 6-foot-7 wing has the championship experience and skill set that contending franchises are looking for. The Los Angeles Lakers are a team that could use Wiggins’ services, but a recent trade report suggests a trade may not be in the cards for the Luka Doncic-led organization.\n\n“Elsewhere in the Western Conference, the Lakers are now pressed for time to find a key wing upgrade before the trade deadline, now that Keon Ellis and De'Andre Hunter are off the table,” ClutchPoints’ Brett Siegel wrote Monday. “Where do the Lakers go from here with all of their expiring salaries?”\n\n“Despite continued interest in Andrew Wiggins, the (Miami) Heat don't appear to have interest in anything the Lakers have offered.”\n\nWiggins is among the best options left on the table for the Lakers. The former Golden State Warriors forward can create his own offense, play well off the ball, and knock down triples at an above-average rate. The Kansas product is averaging 15.6 points, 2.9 assists, and 4.9 rebounds per game with the Heat this season, shooting 46.8% from the field and 38.4% from three-point land.\n\nUnfortunately, Siegel’s report indicates that the Lakers haven’t done their part to convince the Heat to partner with them this season, making it doubtful they land Wiggins by Thursday.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers predicted to acquire $73.8 million six-time All-Star in Dalton Knecht-centered trade",

    "fullText": "Lakers reportedly attempting to outbid Suns, Knicks for Pelicans' $20M 21 PPG sniper originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are approaching the NBA trade deadline with several different options on the table. They could make a major move to benefit the team this season, make more subtle additions, or choose to sit tight. No matter the approach, LeBron James’ priority remains the same: competing for a championship.\n\n“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,” Rich Paul told ESPN. “He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we've had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.”\n\nJames has been an intriguing figure to monitor as the season has progressed. During the summer, there was an unusual dynamic between the Lakers and James, one that prompted ESPN’s Brian Windhorst to suggest a trade could be possible.\n\n“My conversations over the last 3 days have crystallized that the Lakers are essentially viewing LeBron as an expiring contract... I'm just unlocking the door because I am not as convinced as before if it's impossibility,” Windhorst said.\n\nWhile James does not appear likely to be moved at the deadline, the Lakers are focused on building around him and Luka Dončić. One name to monitor is New Orleans Pelicans forward Saddiq Bey, especially after Keon Ellis and De’Andre Hunter were moved in the same deal.\n\n“The Knicks, Lakers and Suns are among the teams to recently inquire with the Pelicans on Saddiq Bey. Over the past month, Bey is averaging 21.2 points, 6 rebounds and 2.6 assists while shooting 44.4% on threes. Bey is generating strong trade interest during his hot stretch,” NBA reporter Evan Sidery wrote.\n\nAs currently constructed, the Lakers are not built to make a championship run or seriously contend. However, a few well-timed moves could drastically change the trajectory of their season.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the Lakers’ front office navigates the trade deadline, given the multiple timelines currently on the roster. If Los Angeles opts to stand pat, it will be clear that the organization is preparing to go all-in during free agency this summer.",

At one point, N3on posed the question to Brooks, who answered without hesitation.\n\n“I would probably say Lebron [James] right now,” the Suns guard said. “I feel like he overrated right now, his time is coming to an end.”\n\nNeedless to say, the remark quickly went viral online. Within hours, Brooks’ honesty was met with a flurry of reactions from fans.\n\nThe comment marks another chapter in the rivalry Brooks and James have found themselves in this season. Both players have had their fair share of exchanges during games between the Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe most notable came in a Dec. 14 thriller, when the two spent much of the night jawing at each other before Brooks was ultimately ejected in the closing seconds after receiving his second technical foul following a confrontation with James after hitting a go-ahead 3-pointer.\n\nPhoenix would eventually fall to Los Angeles, 116-114.\n\nDec 1, 2025; Los Angeles, California, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) moves the ball against Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks (3) during the first half at Crypto.com Arena.

However, Brooks’ comments suggest he views James strictly as an on-court rival, regardless of his accolades.\n\nThe moment also reinforces Brooks’ reputation as an unapologetic edge-setter for the Suns. His confrontational persona has resonated with the fan base and, while it has occasionally led to foul trouble, it has also helped fuel Phoenix to much-needed wins and momentum.\n\nDec 14, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks (3) and Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) react during an altercation that resulted in a technical for Brooks during the second half of a game at the Mortgage Matchup Center.

    "description": "With less than a week to go a lot of trade talk is out there, but the Giannis Antetokounmpo situation could hold up other deals.",
    "fullText": "We are less than a week away from the NBA trade deadline and rumors are flying around fast and furious. Here are some of the latest rumors not involving Giannis Antetokounmpo (to check out the latest on his trade saga, click here).\n\nIt's no secret the Lakers are looking for help on the wing and some depth at the five.\n\nEnter De'Andre Hunter, the Cleveland wing. The Lakers and Cavaliers reportedly have discussed a trade that would send Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht out of Los Angeles and involves a third team, Brooklyn. Here is what Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com reported on the Wine & Gold Podcast.\n\n\"My sources tell me that the Cavs and the Lakers have discussed a general framework surrounding De'Andre Hunter of Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht and then bringing in a third team.\"\n\nThat third team is Brooklyn, and the Lakers would like to get center Day'Ron Sharpe as part of the trade, reports Brett Siegel of Clutch Points.\n\nThe challenge in constructing any trade with these teams is that the Cavaliers are over the second apron, and neither can aggregate multiple players in a trade nor can they take back more money than they send out. Added to that, the Lakers are hard-capped at the first apron and are currently less than $1 million from that number. The Lakers also have one pick to trade, a very valuable 2031 first-rounder, although there have been reports that the Lakers have looked to trade that pick for three lesser-valuable first-rounders, one of which would likely be included in this.\n\nThe prize for the Lakers would be adding Hunter, a player the Cavaliers hoped would fill their need on the wing, but did not. Hunter is averaging 13.9 points a game, often off the bench in Cleveland, shooting 30.9% from beyond the arc this season he is not a lock-down defender. Giving up Hachimura for Hunter is not a great deal, but if Sharpe is coming with him, the Lakers would have to consider it.\n\nThe hottest name in trade talks is another potential Lakers target, Kings wing Keon Ellis.\n\nSacramento is \"sifting through various scenarios for Keon Ellis, sources say, several of which would include trading out veteran forward DeMar DeRozan and/or combo guard Malik Monk along with him,\" reports NBA Insider Jake Fischer of The Stein Line.\n\nMarc Stein at the Stein Line previously reported 14 teams — almost half the league — had called Sacramento to check on an Ellis trade, including the Lakers, Clippers, Cavaliers, Celtics, Knicks and Warriors.\n\nThere's a reason all those teams are interested. Ellis is a plus defender on the wing at 6'4\" who is shooting 36.2% from 3-point range this season (and is a career 41.4% shooter from deep), all on an expiring minimum contract. He is eligible for a contract extension after Feb. 9, and if a team that trades for him can't reach that extension then he becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer.\n\nIf the Kings pair Monk with Ellis in a trade, they make a combined $21 million; with DeRozan, that climbs to $27 million. Either option gives the Kings some flexibility to bring back someone they think can be part of their future.\n\n• Agent Rich Paul denied the reports that he pushed Dallas to trade Anthony Davis.\n\nRich Paul says it’s NOT TRUE that he has demanded the Mavericks to trade Anthony Davis \n\n“I know what was said. That thing was aggregated. This is the power of the internet. If you’re wondering why Rich Paul has a podcast, this is part of the reason why… The reality of it is,… pic.twitter.com/ctWNnlpR0x\n\n— NBA Courtside (@NBA__Courtside) January 25, 2026\n\n• Cleveland has been active in trade talks as it looks to turn around a disappointing season so far, although nobody is exactly sure what their plan is, reports Brian Windhorst and Tim Bontemps of ESPN.\n\n• Oklahoma City may be exploring the trade market for center Isaiah Hartenstein, reports Brian Windhorst of ESPN on the Hoop Collective Podcast. \"He's got a team option next year for $29 million. I've actually heard the Oklahoma City Thunder's name in some trade chatter.\" Remember that next season, both Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams' max contracts kick in, and the finances are going to get a lot tighter in OKC. They probably won't make that trade, but it's worth watching.\n\n• Expect Orlando to make a trade, but it will be all about dumping salary, according to ESPN’s Windhorst and Bontemps. The Magic are $5.6 million into the tax, and, given how this team is playing, would like to get out of it. Trading Tyus Jones and his $7 million salary is a straightforward way to do that.",

I don't know if it's my last game here or not.\n\n\"Lot of memories here. Lot of history. Just super grateful and thankful for the time. Looking up in the rafters and seeing our championship banner, of course there was a lot of reflecting.\"\n\nJames said he doesn't see this season as his NBA farewell tour.\n\n\"I've never even thought to the point of a farewell tour or whatever the case may be because I haven't had that conversation with myself and my family on when is it over,\" he said.\n\nDonovan Mitchell, whose 25 points led Cleveland, understood that even with the Cavaliers (29-20) win streak at five games, this night belonged to James and his legacy of making Cleveland a champion after 52 years of failure in major US sports leagues.\n\n\"He has laid the foundation,\" Mitchell said. \"He has done a lot for the city being from here. We want to replicate that.\n\n\"He deserves the energy he has got here. First time they have done it in 50-some years. We're trying to do it differently. At the end of the day, we're trying to find ways to go out there and bring the city another championship.\"\n\nLuka Doncic had a game-high 29 points for the Lakers (28-18), who also had eight points from Bronny James, LeBron's son.\n\n\"It was pretty cool just sitting over there and watching him,\" James said. \"My mom was here watching her son and her grandson. I don't even know how to wrap that all in my brain. It's so weird and so cool and so surreal.\"\n\nJames, who fell to 9-4 as a visiting player in Cleveland, had averaged 28 points a game in 24 prior contests against the Cavs, who outscored the Lakers 42-22 in the third quarter for a 99-77 lead, hitting 7-of-11 shots from three-point range and 17-of-25 overall in the period.\n\n\"We got outplayed. I got outcoached,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \"We just didn't look like we had all our juice.\"\n\nThe Cavs were without reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley due to a left calf strain.\n\nIn other games, Victor Wembanyama had game highs of 28 points, 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to spark San Antonio's 111-99 triumph at Houston.\n\nPaolo Banchero delivered 31 points for Orlando in a 133-124 victory at Miami while New York's Mikal Bridges scored 30 in a 119-92 victory at Toronto and Julius Randle scored 31 in Minnesota's 118-105 victory at Dallas.\n\nStephen Curry scored 27 points to lead Golden State's 140-124 victory at Utah.",

    "description": "Cleveland's unique 10-inch drop off between the court and the arena floor came into focus again during the Lakers game.",
    "fullText": "Luka Doncic grabbed at his left leg. He immediately thought of Dru Smith. The Miami Heat guard’s knee injury suffered in 2023 when he slipped off the side of the Cleveland Cavaliers court haunted Doncic while he winced in pain near the Lakers bench.\n\nThe Lakers superstar avoided serious injury after falling off the side of the Cavaliers’ raised court on Monday, but the threat of a player being hurt by Cleveland’s unique 10-inch drop off between the court and the arena floor came into focus again during the Lakers’ 129-99 loss to the Cavaliers.\n\n“It is absolutely a safety hazard,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said after Doncic was able to return later in the first quarter. “And I don't know why it's still like that. I don't. You know, you can lodge formal complaints. A lot of times you don't see any change when you lodge a formal complaint.”\n\nDoncic was injured shooting a fadeaway three with 7:58 left in the first quarter. He was hopping on one foot after releasing the shot and hopped right off the platform, grabbing immediately for his left leg. When he hobbled to the locker room, Doncic could barely put any weight on his leg.\n\nBut he returned with 1:32 remaining in the first quarter and finished with 29 points, six assists and five rebounds. He didn’t have any additional braces or wraps on his left leg, but he said he didn’t feel quite 100%.\n\n“I kind of got scared,” Doncic said. “It wasn't a great feeling and looking back at the video I think I got a little bit lucky. It hurts obviously more now, but, just, I tried to go.\"\n\nSmith was injured much more severely in 2023 when he was closing out on defense, landed on a stat sheet and slipped over the edge. He suffered a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament sprain in the accident, and the Heat contacted the NBA to express concerns about the floor at the time.\n\n“It’s tough to see another player get hurt on this court, with the fall, with the drop off,” Lakers guard Gabe Vincent said Monday, “so hopefully something can get fixed with that, but we’re fortunate that [Doncic] is OK.”\n\nCleveland’s Rocket Arena, which opened in 1994 and was last renovated in 2019, is also home to the Cleveland Monsters, an American Hockey League affiliate of the Columbus Blue Jackets. The basketball court is raised to accommodate the ice underneath the floor. But several teams in the NBA, including the Lakers, share their arena with hockey teams and none have a court that drops off like Cleveland’s.\n\n“It's the only court like this so, I guess it's my fault,” Doncic said. “I [gotta] stop jumping like that.\"\n\nThe Lakers have history with concerning courts this year. In November, Doncic said during a postgame news conference that the Lakers’ custom NBA Cup court used during a home game against the Clippers was dangerously slippery. The team flagged the problem to the league and the Lakers did not use the court again because it was not deemed safe for play in time for the other NBA Cup games.\n\nBut when asked if there was a way he could bring the latest problem up with the league, Doncic demurred.\n\n“I don’t know,” Doncic said, “don’t involve me in that.”\n\nSimilarly, Redick said any changes would be \"way above my pay grade.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Lakers (28-17) vs. Cavs (28-20) | Game 46 of 82\n\nLocation: Rocket Arena—Cleveland, Ohio\n\nThe Lakers continue their largest road trip of the season in their fifth straight road game, taking on the Cavaliers for the first time this year.\n\nThe Cavs have been hot as of late, coming in on a four-game win streak and a huge 16-point win over the Magic on Monday. Cleveland has won seven of their last eight games and hold a 16-11 record at home.\n\nThe Lakers are coming off two straight road wins against Dallas and Chicago, who both had won four straight games going into their matchup against Los Angeles. They can continue that trend with a win in Cleveland.\n\nThe Lakers are 3-1 on the road trip and have won four of their last five games. The Lakers are coming off an all-around 11-point win over the Bulls on Monday behind Luka Dončić notching 46 points on a season-high eight 3s.\n\nDončić had arguably his best outing passing the ball as well, with multiple Magic-Johnson-like passes on his way to 11 assists on the night. It was the 23rd time this season he finished with a double-double and the eighth time he had over 40 points.\n\nThe Lakers -- who sit fifth in the West at 28-17 -- will be tested against a depleted Cavs team that sit fourth in the East with a 28-20 record. The Lakers are 10-9 this season against teams over .500.\n\nCleveland’s offense is spearheaded by Donovan Mitchell, who is having an elite All-Star season, averaging 29.5 points per game for fifth most in the NBA, while also leading the team in assists (5.8) and steals (1.5). Mitchell has led the Cavs in scoring in eight of the last 10 games and is coming off a 45-point showing against the Magic.\n\nSo we will see a clash of Dončić and Mitchell in Cleveland. FUN!\n\nWith Darius Garland set to miss his seventh consecutive game due to a right great toe sprain, Mitchell will continue to be the Cavs’ primary scorer and facilitator. Jaylon Tyson has been an emerging young talent in place of Garland with 14 ppg and a team-high 46% shooting from 3 in 28 starts this season.\n\nThe Cavaliers will also be without Evan Mobley, who is expected to miss at least one week with a calf injury, removing a key interior presence on both ends of the floor. In his absence, Jarrett Allen (13.3 points, 7.8 rebounds) becomes the focal point in the paint against Deandre Ayton, while Cleveland leans more heavily on wing depth and Mitchell’s shot-making to generate offense.\n\nDespite the injuries, the Cavs are fourth in the NBA in scoring, but the absences of Garland and Mobley significantly alter their offensive balance and defensive identity.\n\nNOTABLE OPPONENT RANKS AMONG THE NBA\n\nThe Cavs have the 9th-rated offense (116.4) and the 12th-rated defense (113.8) in the NBA. Here are their notable rankings this season:\n\nAustin Reaves (left calf strain): Out\n\nAdou Thiero (right MCL sprain): Out\n\nDe’Andre Hunter (right knee): Probable\n\nSam Merrill (right hand): Probable\n\nLuke Travers (hamstring): Day-to-day\n\nThe Lakers will wear their gold uniform on the road, while the Cavs will wear their navy blue 2007 alternate jersey.\n\nThe Lakers will continue their eight-game road trip in Washington on Friday against the Wizards.",

That might be the first topic addressed by Clark, who will join the studio team of Maria Taylor and three former NBA stars: Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady.\n\nExpectations that Reaves would take the floor Wednesday in a nationally televised game against the Cleveland Cavaliers were heightened Tuesday when ESPN insider Shams Charania posted on X that the Lakers guard would be “available to return to the lineup on Wednesday.”\n\nA few moments later, however, the post was deleted with no explanation and the Lakers' injury report lists Reaves as out.\n\nClark might stick to lauding Doncic, considering that the superstar NBA guard complimented her game in 2024, saying \"that’s the women’s Steph Curry. She can shoot it better than me.”\n\nClark, who attended Iowa, is the all-time leading scorer in NCAA history. In two seasons with the Indiana Fever, she was named WNBA Rookie of the Year and is a two-time All-Star despite missing much of the 2025 season with a severe groin injury.\n\n“Caitlin is one of the most captivating players and dynamic scorers in basketball,” NBC Sports Executive Producer Sam Flood said in a statement. “We’re excited to have Caitlin join Hall of Famers Melo, Vince, Tracy and Reggie in New York for the launch of Sunday Night Basketball.”\n\nThe Lakers-Knicks game will begin a doubleheader that also includes the Oklahoma City Thunder facing the Denver Nuggets.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Early on in the 25/26 season, when the Los Angeles Lakers were flying high, Austin Reaves was one of their best players. Of course, he was playing a supporting role to Luka Doncic, but it was key, and something they’re missing in their current rollercoaster stretch.\n\nFor now, Reaves remains out with the calf strain he sustained in December and will miss the Lakers’ next game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, at the very least. However, he is not too far from returning, and could very well arrive in time for the most crucial part of the season.\n\nDanny Green, for one, feels that Reaves’ performances in the postseason will actually determine how far the Lakers can go. One thing is for certain, though. Reaves has to do much better than he did in previous seasons.\n\nOn ESPN, the topic of discussion was: which player is most important to the Lakers this season, and Green’s answer was Reaves and how he performs in the playoffs. “Of course, in the playoffs, we’ve seen his numbers have taken a dip,” he began.\n\nLast season, Reaves averaged 21 points per game in the regular season, but his numbers dipped to 16 in the playoffs. This season, his regular-season scoring has jumped to 26 points per game so far. It is a significant leap, and one that will need to carry over into the playoffs as well.\n\nGreen feels that not much will change on the defensive front for the Lakers, even if they sign a 3 and D-wing. So, their best chance to beat teams is to outscore them.\n\n“They’re gonna need these guys to score a bunch, obviously. Luke is proven, Bron is proven in the playoffs, Austin Reaves is the guy they’re kind of seeing if he’s gonna grow and take that next step to being that third scorer consistently, night in and night out,” Green added. “So, they’re gonna need him.”\n\nThe Lakers looked genuinely comfortable with Reaves and Doncic running the offense, but they slipped into a slump once Reaves was injured and LeBron was forced into a secondary scoring role. That is something that has to change in the coming weeks, even if it means James taking a step back to allow Reaves to thrive.\n\nCurrently, the Lakers are 28-17 and fifth in the Western Conference.\n\nThe post “They’re Gonna Need Him”: Austin Reaves’ Playoff Leap Will Determine Lakers’ Ceiling, Says Danny Green appeared first on The SportsRush.",

They came in with a 6-6 record and looked to go over .500 after losing five of their six previous games.\n\nThey fell behind 35-24 at the end of the first quarter and looked to be in trouble. They still trailed 68-60 at halftime, but afterward, South Bay clamped down defensively and held the Skyhawks to just 39 second-half points, allowing it to come away with a 121-107 victory.\n\nOverall, it held the Skyhawks to 39.6% shooting from the field and 28.9% from 3-point range, and it forced 19 turnovers while scoring 29 points off those miscues. Seven of its players scored in double figures, and it had a robust total of 28 assists.\n\nThe Lakers' starting backcourt of R.J. Davis and Kobe Bufkin shot a combined 11-of-32 from the field, but they combined for 11 assists against just three turnovers. Rookie Augustas Marciulionis had 10 assists off the bench, and big man Kylor Kelley grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked six shots.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: South Bay Lakers recap: G League Lakers get easy win over Skyhawks",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO, Illinois -- The ball was moving, the shots were falling, and Luka Dončić created magic in Chicago.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers continued their momentum in their road trip behind a season-high night from 3 from Dončić and an all-around effort, beating the Bulls 129-118 on the road at the United Center on Monday.\n\nDončić orchestrated one of his best performances of the year in the Lakers' fourth contest of a current eight-game road trip. He brought out every trick and move from his deep bag with multiple no-look, behind the back and cross-court passes against the Bulls.\n\nThe Slovenian finished with 46 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds while making eight 3s -- his season-high -- and 15 of 25 shots from the field.\n\nThe Lakers knocked down 16 three-pointers and shot 54% from beyond the arc against the Bulls, marking their third-highest totals this season in both makes and efficiency.\n\nThings were clicking for the Lakers in the first half; their 3-ball was falling, and they disrupted Chicago's offense. They forced the Bulls -- who are the best team in the NBA at not turning it over -- to commit over 10 turnovers in the first half, even causing multiple near shot clock violations that forced the Bulls to shoot a bad shot with the clock winding down.\n\nThe Lakers reached a 20-point lead in the second quarter -- their biggest of the game -- and it looked as though it was heading toward a blowout.\n\nThen, just like they did against the Mavericks, the Lakers had a horrendous run in the third quarter. The Bulls came out with more energy and opened the third, leading to a 24-12 run and the score within one.\n\nAs the Bulls pushed closer to taking back the lead, Dončić played hero for L.A. to keep Chicago at bay, scoring 20 points with four 3-pointers in the third quarter.\n\nDončić would continue his dominance into the fourth, with the help of Rui Hachimura and LeBron James.\n\nJames was the Lakers' halftime scoring leader with 20 points through two quarters. He played a large part in the Lakers' big start in Chicago, having multiple one-handed dunks and defensive sequences. James finished with 24 points.\n\nHachimura continued his damage in his new role as the team's sixth man. He started right where he left off in Dallas, hitting nearly every shot he took. Hachimura poured in 23 points on nine of 11 shooting (four made 3s).\n\nThe Lakers have won four of their last five games and will have much-needed reinforcements, with coach JJ Redick hinting that Austin Reaves will make his return within the road trip. They will face the Cleveland Cavaliers next on Wednesday.",

He made a significant impact, scoring 24 points in a 112-104 win over the Los Angeles Lakers at the Intuit Center on Thursday night.\n\nLeonard came into Thursday's game averaging a career-high 28.9 points while playing in 30 of the Clippers' 43 games. He had scored a combined 68 points versus the Washington Wizards and Charlotte Hornets in the two games he played before sitting out with his injury. Leonard played 25 minutes, shooting 9-for-19 (and 3-of-7 on 3-pointers) from the floor.\n\nKawhi doing Kawhi things 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/WRH7eWx4JW\n\n— LA Clippers (@LAClippers) January 23, 2026\n\nThe Clippers held a 79-53 lead midway through the third quarter after an Ivica Zubac dunk. From there, however, the Lakers chipped away at that 26-point margin with a 19-7 run to end the frame. That became a 34-14 run that trimmed the Clippers' lead to 93-85 by the 7:40 mark of the fourth quarter.\n\nA Luka Dončić fadeaway 3-pointer with Kris Dunn guarding him moved the Lakers to within 93-91 with 5:56 remaining. But James Harden countered with a 3 of his own to finally stop the Lakers' momentum and steady the Clippers. John Collins followed with a layup and Zubac hit two free throws to restore the Clippers' lead back to 100-91 with under four minutes to play.\n\nLUKA DONCIC. \n\nOUT OF THIS WORLD. pic.twitter.com/mn8yi1zSqY\n\n— Italo Santana (@BulletClubIta) January 23, 2026\n\nClippers coach Ty Lue then won a big replay challenge, arguing that a foul on Jordan Miller should instead be ruled a loose ball foul on the Lakers' Marcus Smart. Lue won the challenge, which took two free throws away from Smart and awarded them to Miller because the Lakers were in the penalty. Miller made one of the two free throws, but that gave the Clippers a 10-point lead.\n\nYet the Lakers fought back again with LeBron James getting a fast-break dunk and Smart turning a Miller turnover into a jumper. Leonard committed another turnover, losing the ball out of bounds, and that led to a Jarred Vanderbilt dunk to cut the Clippers' lead to 103-99.\n\nFollowing two free throws by Zubac, James was fouled on a layup and made the subsequent free throw for a 3-point play to pull the Lakers to within 105-102. But Zubac followed with a reverse dunk and Collins hit a 3-pointer after Rui Hachimura missed a long-range shot of his own. That was the dagger, giving the Clippers a 110-102 lead with 43 seconds remaining.\n\nDoncic finished with a game-high 32 points, but shot 11-of-27 from the floor (including 3-of-13 on 3s). He added 11 rebounds and 8 assists. James scored 23 points after tallying only 9 at halftime. But he also shot 9-of-19 while grabbing 5 rebounds and dishing out 6 assists.\n\nThe Lakers' loss dropped them to 26-17 and the No. 6 spot in the Western Conference, behind the Houston Rockets and Phoenix Suns. Up next, they visit the Dallas Mavericks (19-26) for a nationally televised prime-time matchup Saturday on ABC. The Mavs have won four in a row and five of their past six games.\n\nFor the Clippers, Zubac scored 18 points with 19 rebounds while Harden also scored 18 and notched 10 assists. Altogether, seven Clippers reached double figures in scoring. The win was the Clippers' 14th in their past 17 games and improved their record to 20-24, good for 10th place in the West. They're off until Sunday, when they host the Brooklyn Nets (12-30).",

James opened the spurt with a 3-pointer and ended it with a huge dunk off Harden's turnover after Doncic chipped in 9 points in the quarter.\n\nThe Clippers dominated the first half, outscoring the Lakers 17-7 — including nine in a row — over the final minutes to go into halftime leading 64-47.\n\nDoncic scored just three of his 17 first-half points in the second quarter when Leonard led the bench against Doncic and James.

    "fullText": "As we hit the halfway point in the NBA schedule, the Los Angeles Clippers finally seem to be salvaging their season, but that progress will be tested tonight when they host the Los Angeles Lakers at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe Battle of L.A. season series sits at 1-1 heading into this matchup, and my Lakers vs. Clippers predictions expect LeBron James to be one of the swing factors.\n\nLet's dive right into my NBA picks for Thursday, January 22.\n\nLakers vs Clippers best bet: LeBron James Over 12.5 rebounds + assists (-112 bet365)\n\nLeBron James' injury issues may point to a 41-year-old in his 23rd season, but his stat lines suggest he’s got something left in the tank. James has been able to keep his sciatica and arthritis at bay while starting 2026 with a bang, so look for his fingerprints to be all over tonight’s clash with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nWith Luka Doncic doing so much of the scoring for the Los Angeles Lakers, I’m targeting LeBron’s rebounds and assists here, and he’s gone past this combo O/U number in four of his past five outings.\n\nJames has been getting the job done in both these categories so far this month, with averages of 7.7 RPG and 7.6 APG in January, and he was closing in on a triple-double in L.A.’s win over the Denver Nuggets earlier this week.\n\nUntil Austin Reaves returns, LeBron is going to have a larger share of the playmaking, particularly when Luka is on the bench, and there’s just not a lot of secondary ball-handling in the current rotation. Equally, he’s got a big role to play alongside Deandre Ayton on the boards.\n\nAt this stage of his career, James can still do the little things that drive winning, and the Lakers will need all of that veteran savvy to hold off their cross-city rivals tonight.\n\nThe Lakers are 7-3 SU in their last 10 meetings with the Clippers, and an impressive 14-8 on the road this season. With Kawhi Leonard still listed as questionable, the burden on James Harden could once again be massive, and the hosts gave up 138 points to the Chicago Bulls this week.\n\nHarden continues to put up big numbers, and I’ll take the Over on his rebounds prop here. He’s grabbed 4+ boards in six of his last seven games, and the Clippers will gladly keep him closer to the rim if it avoids the Luka defensive assignment.\n\nIvica Zubac has had some miserable possessions trying to guard Doncic on switches in the past, but the Clippers will lean on him for big minutes here. Zubac has posted three straight double-doubles, and he’s finished with 11+ rebounds in his last four games.\n\nSpread: Lakers -1.5 (+100) | Clippers +1.5 (-120)\n\nMoneyline: Lakers -110 | Clippers -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 223.5 (-110) | Under 223.5 (-110)\n\nThe Lakers are 5-2 ATS in the last seven meetings between these teams.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere are just two more weeks until the NBA trade deadline on Feb. 5, and one trending topic centers on Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr.\n\nThe playoffs are a far stretch for the Nets, who currently sit at 12-30, so Brooklyn has been heavily involved in trade rumors. Specifically with All-Star hopeful Michael Porter Jr.\n\nAfter being traded from the Denver Nuggets to Brooklyn this offseason, Porter Jr. has become a number-one option for a team for the first time in his career. This has made him a player who's been brought up in rumors. Let's take a look.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors have been teams to watch in a trade involving the Nets' forward, but these talks have slowed down.\n\n\"It no longer appears as if pursuing Porter is a path the Warriors would like to go down in the wake of Butler's injury,\" Brett Siegel of ClutchPoints said. \"The Los Angeles Lakers possibly throwing their hat in the mix for Porter isn't a realistic possibility and something they don't have a desire to do, sources said.\"\n\nAlthough Michael Porter Jr. is on pace for career-highs in points (25.3), rebounds (7.4), and assists (3.2) this season, the contract that is linked to him has made teams uninterested in trading for the 27-year-old.\n\nPorter Jr. has two years remaining on the five-year, $179.2 million deal he signed back in 2021 with the Nuggets.\n\nIt's looking like neither team is interested in picking up the contract of Porter Jr., so a trade is looking less and less likely.\n\nNets take tanking to the next level, ending 10-year drought with this horrific stat\n\nWill the Nets trade Cam Thomas at the NBA trade deadline?\n\nJordi Fernandez demands better physicality from Brooklyn Nets rookie Egor Demin\n\nWarriors trade idea swaps Jonathan Kuminga for 25.7 PPG scorer in All-Star conversation",

    "fullText": "TEMPE — The Valley Suns had reinforcements on Wednesday as they were able to take a 117-111 win against the Stockton Kings.\n\nDec 1, 2025; Los Angeles, California, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Jamaree Bouyea (17) moves to the basket against Los Angeles Lakers forward Dalton Knecht (4) during the first half at Crypto.com Arena. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nThe Suns entered Wednesday’s matchup coming off a 113-108 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors on Monday. With rookies Rasheer Fleming and Khaman Maluach, along with two-way player Jamaree Bouyea, assigned back to the team, the Valley hoped the trio would provide the spark needed to get back on track.\n\nFleming and Maluach had been traveling with the Phoenix Suns throughout the six-game road trip, earning minutes whenever the team needed them. Bouyea is coming off concussion protocol and has not played since early January.\n\nHowever, Wednesday’s game allowed the rookies to flourish with increased playing time.\n\nOct 24, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Clippers center Yanic Konan Niederhauser (14) defends Phoenix Suns center Khaman Maluach (10) in the second half at Intuit Dome. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\n\nIn the first half alone, Fleming posted 13 points, three rebounds and two steals. Maluach added eight points and six rebounds but dealt with foul trouble, picking up three fouls before halftime. Bouyea struggled early but found a rhythm late in the half, finishing with nine points, two rebounds, and two assists at the break.\n\nDespite limited minutes, Bouyea’s strong finish to the first half suggested he was simply shaking off rust.\n\nThe Suns opened the second half on an 18-0 run, partly by Bouyea’s eight points. He finished the night with 27 points, while Fleming finished with 19 points and Maluach finished with 23.\n\nNov 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Rasheer Fleming (20) against the Houston Rockets at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nThe trio put up great numbers, as their fatigue from travel didn’t last long. Head coach Paul Jesperson acknowledged their earlier game struggles, especially Bouyea, as Wednesday was his first official night in a Valley Suns uniform.\n\n“We knew there was probably going to be a little fatigue there and a little bit of those guys just having to feel the game out a little bit as it progressed,” he said post-game. “I think [Bouyea] did exactly that. Kind of found his spots, got comfort level [and] got a little energy to him.”\n\nThe Suns finish out the week with a matchup against the Texas Legends on the road on Friday, Jan. 23, at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWM Phoenix Open brings golf to streetwear with Samba shoe collab",

    "fullText": "Bombshell report involving Bronny, LeBron James reveals new details about Lakers' 2024 NBA Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2024 NBA Draft was highly anticipated for one reason in particular.\n\nWith the Los Angeles Lakers having two picks (No. 17 and No. 55) and LeBron James’ son, Bronny, declaring for the draft after a lackluster freshman campaign at USC, many believed the Lakers would pair their superstar forward with his eldest son.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Lakers did just that, selecting James with their lone second-round pick. On Wednesday, though, a bombshell report involving the James clan reveals new details about the 2024 Draft that’ll surprise fans.\n\n“And when the Lakers drafted James' son Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie (Buss) privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn't,” ESPN’s Baxter Holmes reported Wednesday.\n\nEssentially, if one were to read between the lines, one would conclude that although Buss and the Lakers didn’t genuinely believe Bronny was worth a draft pick, they selected him to appease their aging superstar.\n\nFollowing the highly scrutinized move, Buss felt that James didn’t appreciate the Lakers’ commitment to going out of their way to make him happy, even if their decision wasn’t in the franchise’s best interest.\n\nFast forward to early 2026, and Bronny has been demoted to the G-League several times and doesn’t appear to have a bright future in Los Angeles. It’s reasonable to assume Buss’s frustration with James hasn’t only gotten worse since the 2024 Draft.\n\nMore NBA: Proposed Warriors trade sees Golden State make NBA-altering deal for $101 million Lakers star",

    "description": "The Lakers overcame a 16-point deficit to notch one of their most significant wins of the season, taking down the Nuggets.",
    "fullText": "The first time chants of “Let’s go, La-kers” rang out in Ball Arena, Denver’s rowdy home crowd booed the unwelcome slogan into silence. Minutes later when the game ended, there weren’t enough home fans left to quiet the purple and gold faithful.\n\nThe Lakers overcame a 16-point deficit in the third quarter to notch one of their most significant wins of the season, taking down the Denver Nuggets 115-107 on Tuesday. Luka Doncic recorded his fifth triple-double of the season with 38 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists while LeBron James had 19 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.\n\nDespite losing center Deandre Ayton to a left eye injury in the second quarter, the Lakers still dominated the shorthanded Nuggets in the paint, outrebounding Denver 51-31. The Nuggets were playing without star center Nikola Jokic (knee) and backup center Jonas Valanciunas (calf).\n\nThe Lakers (26-16) slowly are returning to full health as guard Austin Reaves’ calf injury is “progressing well,” coach JJ Redick said before the game, and they Lakrs hope he could play on the eight-game trip that will stretch until Feb. 3. Reaves is approaching the four-week point after aggravating his calf injury on Christmas Day.\n\nFor the first time since the injury, Reaves went on a trip with the team. He blended seamlessly into the bench group, wearing head-to-toe black next to the coaches.\n\nOn the other bench, Denver’s injured superstar was dressed in a forest green suit. Jokic, the Nuggets' two-time most valuable player, has been sidelined because of a knee injury since Dec. 30. As significant as the Lakers’ injuries have been with the team having all 14 of its standard contract players available for only two games this season, the Nuggets’ problems could be even worse.\n\nThree members of the Nuggets’ season-opening starting rotation were sidelined Tuesday. Starting guard Christian Braun has been out since injuring an ankle Nov. 12 and Cameron Johnson has missed 15 games because of a knee injury. Valanciunas, who has missed the last 11 games, sat next to Jokic.\n\nDenver (29-15) still had no problem controlling the first half, finishing the second quarter on a 14-3 run to claim a 14-point lead. Jamal Murray drained a three-pointer from almost three-quarters court at the buzzer to punctuate a chaotic final 35 seconds that included Doncic’s 13th technical foul of the season and an 8-0 run for the Nuggets.\n\nMurray, who finished with 28 points and 11 assists, is angling for his first All-Star appearance. If coaches select the 28-year-old guard as a reserve, it would be the first time in Jokic’s career that he had a teammate named to the All-Star team.\n\nDoncic, who was named a starter for next month’s midseason showcase Monday, showed why he led the league in fan voting. He had nine points and four assists in the third quarter as the Lakers trimmed a 16-point deficit to two entering the fourth quarter. Doncic scored or assisted on 11 unanswered Lakers points.\n\nAfter Doncic’s third-quarter domination, James tagged in and scored five consecutive points to end the quarter. He assisted on a basket by Drew Timme on the Lakers’ opening possession of the fourth quarter that tied the score 88-88.\n\nThe Lakers took the lead for good with a 16-0 run, holding the Nuggets scoreless for more than 6½ minutes. Marcus Smart scored 11 of his 15 points during the run, while Denver missed nine consecutive shots.\n\nWhile Doncic will return to the All-Star stage next month at Intuit Dome, James was not named a starter for the first time in 21 years. He will have to wait for a vote from coaches or a special selection from NBA commissioner Adam Silver to earn his 22nd All-Star honor.\n\n“Given the missed games early, wasn't surprised,” Redick said, referring to James missing the first 14 games because of sciatica. “I believe he'll be in the All-Star game.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Lakers got a much-needed win on Sunday against a strong Raptors squad.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers' recent extended slump continued on Saturday when they lost 132-116 to the Portland Trail Blazers. In that game, they were without Luka Doncic, Denadre Ayton and Jaxson Hayes, but all three returned to action on Sunday when they hosted the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe Raptors came into Sunday's game with a 25-18 record, which had them in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, and they boast arguably the NBA's best fast-break attack. It looked like the Lakers were in for another stiff test and possibly their 13th loss in 22 games.\n\nThey found themselves behind 30-21 at the end of the first quarter because of the lackluster defense that has become a habit for them over the last several weeks. But they responded with 11 unanswered points and a 24-6 overall run to start the second quarter. After most of the second and third quarters were close, L.A. went on an 11-3 run to end the third period, and after that, it opened things up en route to a 110-93 victory.\n\nToronto's 93 points were a season low for it, and it shot only 41.8% from the field and 21.9% from 3-point range. Los Angeles started to employ a zone defense in the second quarter that helped turn the tide, and it also outrebounded the Raptors by five and held them to 14 fast-break points. With a 25-16 record, L.A. remains in sixth place in the Western Conference and has a half-game cushion over the seventh-place Phoenix Suns.\n\nSmart helped hold Raptors starting point guard Immanuel Quickley, who came into this game averaging 16.5 points a game, to nine points on 4-of-9 field-goal shooting. Offensively, he made half of his six shot attempts and two of his three 3-point attempts, and he finished with eight points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal, but he committed five turnovers in 25 minutes.\n\nFor the second straight game, LaRavia contributed next to nothing offensively. He made one of his five shot attempts and ended up with two points, to go along with five rebounds, two assists and one steal in 19 minutes.\n\nAyton got the ball fairly often in the first half, allowing him to log 12 points by halftime. The Lakers continued to feed him the ball in prime scoring position throughout the game, and he took full advantage by making all 10 of his shot attempts and five of his six free throw attempts, giving him 25 points. He also grabbed 13 rebounds and added one assist and one block in 33 minutes.\n\nDoncic scored 18 points in the first half, but he was just 5-of-14 from the field during that time, and he had three of his shots blocked by Raptors forward Collin Murray-Boyles. He shot even more poorly in the second half and ended up 8-of-23 overall from the field, although he did go 5-of-12 from 3-point land.\n\nDoncic finished this game with 25 points, seven assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block in 34 minutes.\n\nJames played 32 minutes and shot 9-of-17 from the floor, allowing him to finish with 24 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two blocks. When the Lakers went on that 24-6 run early in the second quarter, he scored nine points to ignite that spurt.\n\nIn 17 minutes, Vincent hit two of his five shot attempts and finished with five points, two assists, one rebound and one steal.\n\nAfter missing three straight games with a hamstring ailment, Hayes played 13 minutes and had two points and five rebounds to help L.A.'s cause.\n\nHachimura may not be fully back in game shape and rhythm after missing seven straight games with a calf injury. But he made a decent contribution on Sunday with 10 points on 4-of-10 shooting in 21 minutes off the bench. However, he didn't have a single rebound, assist, steal or block.\n\nVanderbilt was very active in this contest, and it resulted in him putting up good numbers across the board. In 21 minutes, he grabbed nine rebounds and added two points, one assist, two steals and two blocks. He was a significant factor when the Lakers established a sizable lead late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter, especially defensively and on the boards.\n\nOne night after scoring 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting, Timme got 16 minutes and went 1-of-4 overall and 1-of-2 from downtown. He finished with three points, three rebounds and two assists.\n\nAll four players were on the court for the final 2:17 of this game. Knecht, the younger James and Bufkin went scoreless and didn't attempt a single shot, while Smith made one of his three shot attempts and had three points.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. wins going away against Raptors",

    "fullText": "The Lakers are back in the win column after taking down the Toronto Raptors 110-93 at Crypto.com Arena on Thursday behind a perfect night from their starting center, Deandre Ayton.\n\nAyton became the third player in franchise history to be perfect from the field with at least 10 shot attempts, finishing the game with 25 points and 13 rebounds on 10-for-10 shooting. He joined Wilt Chamberlain (March 11, 1969) and Mitch Kupchak (Nov. 20, 1981) as the only Lakers to do so.\n\nIt was the third time this season Ayton finished perfect from the field and with double-digit scoring.\n\nAlong with the Lakers' starting bigman's best performance of the season, Luka Dončić and LeBron James also finished with over 20 points in the Lakers' 25th win of the season.\n\nDončić made his return to the lineup after being sidelined against the Trail Blazers on Saturday, finishing with 25 points and seven assists. James played in both back-to-back games for the second time this season and in a row, finishing with 24 points, seven rebounds and four assists.\n\nAfter producing solid minutes in the road loss in Portland, Drew Timme earned more minutes from coach JJ Redick and even got words of approval from James himself after the game, resulting in the sophomore getting some early minutes against the Raptors.\n\nRedick started Timme to begin the second quarter after the Lakers struggled to a slow start, trailing 30-23 at the end of the first quarter. Redick went with a big lineup that included Marcus Smart, Jarred Vanderbilt, Drew Timme, James and Ayton to begin the second.\n\nThat group outmatched and even outperformed Toronto, outscoring them 15-3. The Lakers rode that momentum for the rest of the quarter, but Raptors big man Sandro Mamukelashvili, yes, him, gave the Lakers fits, keeping the score close. Mamukelashvili finished with 20 points on eight-of-12 shooting.\n\nThe Lakers ended the first half with a one-point lead after Dončić beat the horn with his signature patented step-back 3 that got the sold-out crowd buzzing. After a back-and-forth third-quarter start, the Lakers slowly pulled away with the score.\n\nTheir efficiency in the third kept them riding the momentum, hitting five of their 10 attempts from 3 and eight of 12 from two. The Lakers' push had them outscore the Raptors 32-26 in the third and finally put them away with a 23-13 score in the fourth.\n\nThe Lakers improved to 25-16  and 12-8 at home as they still remain in the sixth spot in the West.\n\nThey concluded five games in six days but will now go on an eight-game road trip, starting in Denver on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "Before the Lakers took the court Saturday night, they added two more starters and a key reserve to the injured list. But the Lakers still had LeBron James and they hoped he could carry them past Portland.\n\nStarters Luka Doncic (left groin soreness) and Deandre Ayton (left knee soreness) did not play. In the fourth quarter, Marcus Smart went down amid a pile of players in the lane and eventually limped to the locker room never to return.\n\nAs for James and the rest of the Lakers, all of the injuries were too much to overcome in a 132-116 loss to the Trail Blazers at the Moda Center.\n\nSmart had 25 points before he went to the locker room. James had 20 points but was just six for 16 from the field. He had nine rebounds and eight assists for a Lakers team that has lost five of its last six games.\n\nDrew Timme was a positive for the Lakers, scoring a career-high 21 points. Rui Hachimura and Maxi Kleber each had 11 points.\n\nShaedon Sharpe led Portland (21-22) with 25 points. Jerami Grant and Caleb Love each scored 22 points and Donovan Clingan finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nDoncic, who underwent an MRI and is listed as day-to-day, was dealing with the injury all of last week despite playing against the Kings, Hawks and Hornets.\n\n“I think it was an accumulation of a longer week, more lingering, if anything,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said before the game.\n\nThe Lakers (24-16) aren't sure if Ayton will play against Toronto on Sunday. The center is day-to-day with left knee soreness.\n\n“He took a hit in his knee and there was no swelling, just some soreness,” Redick said.\n\nThe Lakers were also without backup center Jaxson Hayes, who didn’t play against the Trail Blazers because of left hamstring tendinopathy. Redick said there's a chance Hayes could play Sunday.\n\nJames missed his first five shots in the first quarter, finishing one-for-seven from the field for just two points.\n\nThe Lakers were called for 13 fouls in the first quarter, leading to 22 free-throw attempts for the Trail Blazers, a big reason why they opened a 40-27 lead after the first 12 minutes of play.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Lakers were very short-handed on Saturday versus the Trail Blazers, and they ended up losing again by a wide margin.",
    "fullText": "The day before the Los Angeles Lakers' Saturday matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers, Luka Doncic was ruled out due to groin soreness. Prior to the opening tip of that game, they got more bad news when it was revealed that starting center Deandre Ayton and backup center Jaxson Hayes also wouldn't play.\n\nWith Austin Reaves still sidelined due to a gastrocnemius strain, the Lakers were in a very difficult situation against a Portland team that had won eight of its last 11 games.\n\nLos Angeles was competitive early, but a 15-2 Trail Blazers run put them up 40-27 at the end of the first quarter. They shot a whopping 22 free throws in the first quarter, and in general, that first period set the tone for the entire evening.\n\nThe Lakers were never able to mount a serious challenge, as they ended up losing, 132-116. It was their fifth loss in their last six games and their 12th loss in their last 21 contests, as well as the second game in a row they gave up over 130 points.\n\nThey simply got outclassed in almost every category. They let Portland shoot 52.3% from the field and 38.1% from 3-point range, and they got outrebounded by 15 while giving up 27 second-chance points. It's becoming a broken record for the Lakers — they continue to put up a weak level of resistance defensively while often getting outplayed in the effort categories.\n\nThey now have a 24-16 record and remain in sixth place in the Western Conference, and they're just half a game ahead of the seventh-place Phoenix Suns.\n\nSmart did plenty to give the Lakers a chance to win this game, at least offensively. He took 17 shot attempts, which was a new season high for him, and made nine of them while going 4-of-6 from 3-point range, giving him a team-high 25 points. He also had two rebounds and one steal, but he had no assists in 25 minutes.\n\nThe Lakers needed an all-hands-on-deck effort, especially offensively, in this game, but LaRavia didn't pull his weight. He got off only two shot attempts and missed both of them, and he scored just two points on free throws. In 28 minutes, he contributed five rebounds, four assists and one steal.\n\nKleber has barely scored or even looked to score this season, but early on, he was aggressive offensively. He scored nine points in the first quarter and ended up with 11 points on 4-of-8 field-goal shooting, and he also had five rebounds, one assist and one steal in 21 minutes.\n\nVincent wasn't able to give L.A. much, if anything, on offense. He missed all but one of his six shot attempts and ended up with three points and one assist in 23 minutes.\n\nJames was 1-of-7 in the first quarter and 3-of-12 in the first half, and while he shot somewhat better afterward, he never truly got it going. He finished with 20 points on 6-of-16 shooting from the field, although he did make all seven of his free throw attempts. James did help out with nine rebounds, eight assists, two blocks and one steal.\n\nHachimura made a nice offensive contribution off the bench in 19 minutes. He made four of his seven shot attempts to score 11 points, to go along with one rebound, one assist and two steals.\n\nIn 18 minutes, Vanderbilt made all three of his shots to score six points and added two rebounds, one assist and one block.\n\nTimme, a 6-foot-10 power forward who is on a two-way contract, had a fantastic outing and made the most of his 29 minutes of playing time. He shot 9-of-12 overall and 3-of-4 from downtown, giving him 21 points, and he mixed it up well by scoring deep in the paint and also hitting from the perimeter. He also had four assists, two rebounds and two steals.\n\nAt times, Bufkin hustled well on defense, resulting in two blocks, and on the other end of the floor, he made three of his eight shot attempts, giving him nine points in 22 minutes. He also chipped in one rebound and one assist.\n\nSmith got 10 minutes of playing time on Saturday and finished with five points on 2-of-3 shooting and three assists.\n\nKnecht played five minutes and hit a 3-pointer, while the younger James got eight minutes on the court and missed both of his shot attempts while notching one assist.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. loses big in Portland while short-handed",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section give their thoughts on the Chargers' playoff exit, the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the, Lakers, Clippers and Chloe Kim.",
    "fullText": "If there’s an important playoff game for the Chargers to win, you can bet they’re going to lose. Such was the case again against New England.\n\nWhile having a decent enough defense, the offense was pathetic. And, yes, I know their offensive line was completely depleted. But, the 49ers were banged up as well. They lost George Kittle and still won.\n\nWell, there’s always “next season.” Unfortunately, those two words still haunt the Chargers and their fans.\n\nOnce again the Chargers flop in the playoffs.\n\nThis time much of the blame should be placed at the top with Jim Harbaugh. Perhaps he did not watch or was not aware of how many times in this year's playoffs teams had failed to convert on fourth down with disastrous consequences. The psychological effect on the team from failing to convert and put points on the board early was evident. He had a team without their top running back and a very weak offensive line yet chose to go for it.\n\nHopefully he will learn from this or maybe it is time for Harbaugh to join his brother in seeking new jobs.\n\nNothing wrong with the Chargers that a new OC with a game plan can't fix. Or is there?\n\nThanks for firing your OC Greg Roman. Loyalty is great but loyalty does not get you to the promised land. In two postseason trips, one touchdown to show for it.\n\nIt needed to be done for Justin Herbert & Co.\n\nThe Yankees won 27 World Series championships by being the best team money can buy. The west coast Yankees, aka the Dodgers, are now the best team money can buy. That's capitalism, baby!\n\nAs a Dodgers fan for a Joe DiMaggio-esque 56 consecutive seasons, I am happy to have Kyle Tucker in the Dodgers' outfield in 2026. Certainly, he will be an improvement over Michael Conforto, and allow Teoscar Hernandez to go back to left field.\n\nHowever, I find it perplexing that a player who appeared in only 78 and 136 games in 2024 and 2025, and who has had only one top 10 MVP finish (fifth in 2023) in his career, would be signed for a whopping average of $60-million annually. To earn that enormous salary over the next four seasons, Tucker should be considered the best player in baseball not named Shohei Ohtani.\n\nNewsflash! The Dodgers buy another superstar, cost be damned! I'm not a Dodgers fan. I'm a Baseball fan, witnessing an organization job a system that destroys parity and fairplay. So go ahead — hop aboard the Dodgers bandwagon for another championship. While baseball fans everywhere else throw up their hands in disgust and flock to the NFL.\n\nThe Dodgers' signing of Kyle Tucker for ridiculous money now ensures a (stoppage) after this baseball season. For everyone saying other teams could do the same thing, really? As much as anyone could love the Dodgers, this just takes away from the game.\n\nIf you’re mad at the Dodgers don't stop there — might as well don a cape and be super mad because MLB has no kryptonite against them.\n\nWe should not expect too much from the Lakers. We have the same offense ran by the Dallas Mavericks for Luka Doncic transplanted to L.A. Give the ball to Luka and everyone else stands around and watch. Who is teaching these guys defense?\n\nHow many more games do fans have to endure before the Lakers hire a coach who is a defensive specialist? Where is Frank Vogel when you need him?\n\nThe only way I see the Lakers or Clippers making it to the second round of the playoffs is if they play each other in the first round.\n\nThe womens' snowboarding competition at next month's Winter Olympics in Milan has taken an interesting twist. American Chloe Kim, two-time Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe, will have to wear a shoulder brace after tearing her labrum. This would be analogous to having one arm tied behind your back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nWalt Wesley, a 6-foot-11 center, was a star at the University of Kansas, where he averaged 19.3 points and 8.3 rebounds a game through three seasons. The Cincinnati Royals made him the No. 6 pick in the 1966 NBA Draft, and he became a solid rotational center in the pros.\n\nIn 1975, the Lakers sent Junior Bridgeman, Dave Meyers, Elmore Smith, and Brian Winters to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Wesley was also shipped to the Lakers along with Abdul-Jabbar in that deal. Wesley appeared in one game with L.A. during the 1975-76 season and had four points, one rebound and one assist in seven minutes.\n\nThat would be the final game he ever played in the NBA.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 21 — Walt Wesley",

    "fullText": "An NBA scout has suggested that Kobe Bryant’s enduring popularity is why LeBron James still isn’t fully embraced by Los Angeles Lakers fans — even as he continues to defy expectations at 41.\n\nLeBron James missed the first 14 games of the season due to sciatica, but has since helped the Los Angeles Lakers to a 24-15 record, putting them fifth in the Western Conference.\n\nWhat LeBron is doing this season cannot go understated, as he is playing excellent basketball at 41 years of age. But not everyone is convinced that Lakers fans are fully aware of what they’re witnessing.\n\nSpeaking to Lakers Daily, an anonymous NBA scout admitted he had been wrong about LeBron James’ decline. The scout added that James has since proved him wrong, praising his form and longevity.\n\nHowever, he argued that James’ greatness isn’t fully appreciated by the Lakers fanbase due to their unwavering support for the late Kobe Bryant.\n\n“I thought he was done after the Suns and Raptors games. He looked so bad on both ends of the floor. I was like, ‘Yeah, Father Time finally got LeBron.’”\n\n“It’s too bad he’s on the Lakers because those fans will never truly appreciate the greatness they are seeing because they are loyal to Kobe, which is stupid because Kobe loved LeBron.”\n\n“Ever since that Raptors game, he has looked unbelievable. He looks like a top-10 player in the league again. It’s incredible. We will never see a player be this good for so long ever again.”\n\nLeBron James has averaged 22.7 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.8 rebounds this season, continuing to lead the LA Lakers in key categories.\n\nSince his return, the team has gone 13-9 in games he has played, with his leadership and playmaking driving their push up the Western Conference standings.\n\nThe 21-time All-Star’s ability to sustain elite production this season has left scouts, analysts, and fans in disbelief.\n\nEven at 41, his physicality and consistency remain unmatched, a testament to his preparation and longevity in a league that rarely spares aging players.\n\nWhile comparisons to Kobe Bryant have long defined his tenure in Los Angeles, the scout’s comments suggest James’ accomplishments may never be fully appreciated by some sections of the Lakers fanbase — even as he continues to rewrite NBA history in purple and gold.",

    "fullText": "Lakers (23–14) vs. Hornets (14–26) | Game 39 of 82\n\nLocation: Crypto.com Arena — Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nThe Lakers host the Hornets for the first time this season at Crypto.com Arena, playing their second of five games in seven days. This is the second matchup this year between the two, with the Lakers beating them by 10 back on Nov 10 in Charlotte.\n\nThe Lakers are coming off a bounce-back commanding 141-116 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday, snapping a three-game skid behind a season-high 19 made 3s and 56% shooting from behind the arc.\n\nWith that performance, the Lakers' 3-point percentage jumped from last to 23rd in the NBA at 34% shooting per contest from deep.\n\nLeBron James was one rebound shy of a triple-double against the Hawks, ultimately lifting the Lakers with 31 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists in his first time playing back-to-back games this season.\n\nLuka Dončić finished with 27 points and 12 assists while pouring in a team-high five 3s, while Deandre Ayton lived up to his Dominayton nickname, controlling the glass with a season-high 18 rebounds along with 17 points.\n\nRui Hachimura made his return and played just 18 minutes under a severe minutes restriction. He looked active on defense and flashed on possessions with some sequences of rustiness on his jumper, finishing with seven points (two rebounds) on three-for-seven shooting off the bench.\n\nThe Hornets enter the game coming off their third loss in the last four games, falling 117-109 to the Clippers on Monday behind Kawhi Leonard and James Harden combining for 67 points.\n\nLaMelo Ball, who is the Hornets' centerpiece and playmaker at 20.1 ppg and 7.0 asts, scored 25 points on 24 shot attempts in Charlotte's loss to the Clippers.\n\nThe Hornets have four starters, Miles Bridges at 19.5 ppg, Brandon Miller at 19.1 ppg, and Kon Knueppel at 19.1 ppg, who average double figures in scoring, but their issue lies in their second unit, with Colin Sexton being their only scoring punch at 15 ppg.\n\nThe Lakers stars should be able to get their shots going, but the story lies in the rest producing to come out with the win, showing where their potential against Atlanta truly lies when their 3 gets going.\n\nThe Hornets sit at 14-26 (12th in the East) on the season and are 7-14 on the road.\n\nThe Hornets have the 11th-rated offense (116.2) and the 21st-rated defense (116.6) in the NBA. Here are their notable rankings this season:\n\n17th in points per game (116.1)\n\n4th in 3-point percentage (37.4%)\n\nSurprise stat: Having an electric player in Ball, who excels in the fast break with his vision and playmaking, it was a surprise to see the Hornets are 27th in fast break points (13.1 points).\n\nBackup center Jaxson Hayes is questionable against the Hornets after missing Tuesday's game against the Hawks.\n\nJaxson Hayes (left hamstring soreness): Questionable\n\nAustin Reaves (left calf strain): Out\n\nAdou Thiero (right MCL sprain): Out\n\nCollin Sexton (hamstring): Questionable\n\nMoussa Diabate (right hip soreness): Questionable\n\nMason Plumlee (right groin surgery): Out\n\nThe Lakers will wear their historic gold unis, while the Hornets will wear their teal  Icon Edition uniforms.\n\nThe Lakers will play another back-to-back in their next two games: Saturday in Portland and then back home on Sunday against the Raptors. This will conclude five games in seven days.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James gave a nod to one of his favorite rappers, Jay-Z, while answering a question about where his drive comes from this late into his career.\n\nJames is in the midst of his record-setting 23rd season in the league, and he still approaches the game with a clear purpose and passion.\n\n“I would never disrespect the basketball gods,” James said. “I understand that it’s a real thing, and I would never disrespect the game when it comes to playing it. So I put the time, the effort and the commitment into it — mentally, physically, spiritually — every time I step on the floor, every time I’m at practice, whatever the case may be.”\n\nMore: Why LeBron James will be only player in NBA with special patch on his jersey\n\nJames capped his comments with a quote from the Brooklyn-based rapper.\n\n“If you can’t respect that, your whole perspective is whack,” James said. “Maybe you’ll love me when I fade to black.”\n\n“As Jay-Z would say, if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack, and maybe you'll love me when I fade to black.”\n\nLeBron’s message to the haters\n\n(Via @mcten 🎥)\n\npic.twitter.com/5j24PBGwQh\n\n— Hoop Herald (@TheHoopHerald) January 14, 2026\n\nThe quote is from Jay-Z’s song “December 4th” off of The Black Album, which was originally released and marketed as a retirement album from the legendary emcee, though he would ultimately return from retirement and make more music.\n\nWith the line, Jay-Z was basically saying that his greatness was being taken for granted, and that his upcoming absence would help people appreciate how great he truly was. Clearly James can relate to that feeling at this point in his career.\n\nDespite his sustained greatness, both on and off the court, James has an ocean of detractors who would rather nitpick ways that he isn’t as good as one legend or another, as opposed to simply appreciating his unique, once-in-a-lifetime greatness.\n\nIt remains to be seen if James will retire after the current campaign, or if he’ll stick around for another year or two. But either way, that day is coming, and when it does, the basketball world will absolutely miss James.",

The Lakers blew it open with a 12-1 run after halftime, but Atlanta gradually trimmed its deficit to 11 points before LA pulled away for good.\n\nRui Hachimura scored seven points as a reserve on a minutes restriction in his return from a seven-game injury absence.\n\nKristaps Porzingis (Achilles tendon) and Zaccharie Risacher (knee) both haven’t played on the Hawks’ trip.\n\nHawks: At Portland on Thursday.\n\nLakers: Host Charlotte on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Lakers coach JJ Redick was asked before Monday's game against the Sacramento Kings how he could ensure his players wouldn't underestimate a nine-win team.\n\n“We don't look at any game as a walkover,” Redick said.\n\nThen the Kings walked all over the Lakers, taking a 20-point lead in the third quarter before winning 124-112 at Golden 1 Center.\n\nLuka Doncic did his best to keep the Lakers in the game, scoring 42 points and collecting eight assists and seven rebounds. But he scored just two points in the fourth quarter and looked slower after having his left thigh wrapped at the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe Lakers got to within seven points in the fourth, but the Kings pulled away. DeMar DeRozan scored 32 points and Russell Westbrook finished with 22 points and seven assists for the Kings (10-30), who shot 59% from the field (48-82) and made 17 three-pointers.\n\nLeBron James, who scored 22 points, wore a patch on his jersey commemorating his unprecedented 23rd NBA season in the city where he played his first NBA game. It features a silhouette of his pregame chalk toss and three colored stripes that represents the three franchises he has played on — the Lakers, Cavaliers and Heat.\n\nHe will wear the patch for the remainder of the season. After each game, the patch will be removed from his jersey, dated and shipped to a Topps’ production facility to be authenticated and inserted into a pack of trading cards.\n\nThe Lakers (23-14) looked strong from the onset when Deandre Ayton won the jump ball and eventually threw a lob pass to James for a 2-0 Lakers lead, a play that has become something the Lakers have used several times to start a game.\n\nJames hit his first four shots and the Lakers took an 8-2 lead before everything started to crumble.\n\nThey were behind 59-43 late in the second quarter. They couldn’t stop Malik Monk, who had 18 points off the bench on six-for-eight shooting, including five for six from three-point range. Monk finished with 26 points.\n\nAfter the hot start, James finished the first half going five for 12 from the field for 12 points. He finished the game shooting eight for 17.\n\nThe Lakers will play the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night at Crypto.com Arena. When the Lakers played a back-to-back game last week, James sat out the second game. Will he do the same Tuesday?\n\n“We’ll see how he feels in the morning,” Redick said.\n\nPerhaps Rui Hachimura will make his return from right calf soreness. He was available to play Monday, but he sat out his seventh consecutive game.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

It started as soon as he got here. He just told me, 'Listen, man. I'm here for you. Whatever you need me to do, whatever you need from me, I'm here for you.'\n\n\"He’s been that way every single day no matter what.\"\n\nThe Utah Jazz scored an upset 123-112 defeat of the Cleveland Cavaliers on the back of 32 points from Keyonte George and 28 points from Lauri Markkanen.",

Sacramento had just ended a seven-game losing streak, and it came into this game with a 9-30 record, which was the second-worst record in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Lakers got out to an early 19-10 lead thanks to some active defense and several fast-break scores. But they went cold for an extended stretch soon afterward and fell behind by as many as 16 points in the second quarter. An 11-2 Lakers run brought them to within 61-54 at halftime, but Sacramento boosted its lead to 20 minutes later, and the Lakers were never able to mount a serious rally, resulting in a 124-112 loss for them.\n\nEven without three-time All-Star center Domantas Sabonis, who has a meniscus injury, the Kings were able to steamroll L.A. with some precise execution and offense. They shot 58.5% from the field and an unbelievable 65.4% from 3-point range, and they caught Los Angeles slow on its defensive rotations to 3-point shooters. Guard Malik Monk, a former Laker, burned his old team with 26 points and seven treys off the bench. Even Russell Westbrook, another former Laker, hit four of his eight attempts from downtown.\n\nLos Angeles' defense wasn't the only problem. While it shot 48.8% overall, it was just 8-of-36 from beyond the arc and had a pronounced lack of offensive balance. Only four of its players hit double figures in scoring, and only two of its men had more than 13 points.\n\nThe Lakers are now on a three-game losing streak, and with a 23-14 record, they're still in fifth place in the Western Conference, but they're in a virtual tie with the sixth-place Phoenix Suns. They're only half a game ahead of the Houston Rockets, who are in seventh place, and they will return home to face the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday.\n\nSmart had some moments where he played effective defense, but he was a liability on the other end of the court. He missed all five of his shot attempts and scored one point, to go along with two rebounds, two assists and two steals in 31 minutes.\n\nLaRavia was another player who contributed next to nothing offensively. He missed six of his seven shot attempts and went 0-of-5 from 3-point range, and he ended up with two points, two rebounds, three assists and one steal in 31 minutes.\n\nAyton had nine rebounds in the first half and 13 for the game, including five on the offensive glass, and he went 4-of-7 from the field. While he got eight free throw attempts, which is a high and unusual amount for him, he made just five of them, which limited him to 13 points in 27 minutes. Ayton also contributed one assist and two blocks, but L.A. could've used a little more scoring from him.\n\nJames got off to a hot start in this game with several transition buckets and 10 points overall in the first quarter. But he faded afterward and finished with an anemic 22 points on 8-of-17 field-goal shooting while missing all five of his 3-point tries. He also had four rebounds, three assists and one steal in 33 minutes.\n\nDoncic, at times, almost single-handedly prevented L.A. from falling completely out of this contest early on. He had 26 first-half points on 10-of-14 shooting, with 15 of them coming in bunches during the second quarter. He tried to put his team on his back and carry it toward a comeback, but he didn't receive nearly enough help.\n\nIn all, he scored 42 points and went 16-of-25 from the field, although he was 2-of-9 from downtown. Doncic also helped out with seven rebounds, eight assists and four steals.\n\nThis was a relatively quiet night for Vanderbilt. In 26 minutes, he got four rebounds, but he missed his three field-goal attempts and went scoreless.\n\nVincent went 3-of-6 overall and 3-of-5 from downtown, giving him nine points, plus one assist and one steal, in 18 minutes. He hit two of his treys early in the fourth quarter to try to jump-start a Lakers comeback, but to no avail.\n\nHayes was fairly aggressive and energetic throughout this contest. He got 19 minutes of playing time, and he made five of his six shot attempts to finish with 12 points, while also grabbing four offensive rebounds and five total boards.\n\nKnecht got onto the court for 13 minutes and hit two of his six shot attempts, including one 3-pointer. He finished with five points, two rebounds and one assist.\n\nThe younger James, Kleber and Smith each played only during the final 1:53 of this game. The younger James hit both of his shot attempts and scored six points, while Kleber and Smith went scoreless.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. gets steamrolled by Kings",

Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nIn 1959, the Lakers took 6-foot-4 guard Bobby Smith in the third round of the NBA draft after he had played his college basketball at West Virginia University. He spent two seasons with the Lakers and averaged 2.8 points, 2.5 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 10.5 minutes a game with them.\n\nThose were the only two seasons Smith played in the NBA. He later was the head varsity basketball coach at George C. Marshall High School in Virginia, and from 1978 to 1985, he was an assistant coach at West Virginia University.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 21/No. 24 — Bobby Smith",

    "description": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif.",
    "fullText": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — The rise of another young star on the South Bay Lakers is grooming right in front of our eyes once again.\n\nMeanwhile, down in Southbay…\n\nKobe Bufkin w/ another:\n\n27 pts | 8 reb | 8 ast | 4 stls | 2 blks pic.twitter.com/Po1vn6zXEr\n\n— Lakers Legacy (@LakersLegacyPod) January 7, 2026\n\nIf history has taught us anything, it’s that South Bay is more than just a G League stop—it’s a proving ground. Alex Caruso carved his path here. Austin Reaves refined his game here. Scottie Pippen Jr. rebuilt momentum here. Time and time again, the South Bay Lakers have developed players who either make it back to the NBA or force an NBA team’s hand.\n\nKobe Bufkin looks like the next name on that list.\n\nBufkin poured in 27 points to lead South Bay to a 113–101 win over the Memphis Hustle, putting together another all-around performance that continues to turn heads around the league. At just 22 years old, Bufkin is playing with the confidence, poise, and edge of someone who knows this opportunity won’t last forever.\n\nDrafted 15th overall by the Atlanta Hawks in 2023 out of Michigan, Bufkin entered the league with high expectations. But as is often the case with young guards, things didn’t pan out the way either side envisioned early on. A new chapter opened on November 13, 2025, when Bufkin was traded from the Motor City Cruise, Detroit’s G League affiliate, and landed in South Bay.\n\nThere’s a certain poetry to it.\n\nBufkin was named after the late, great Kobe Bryant, and now finds himself wearing purple and gold in the organization most synonymous with the Mamba legacy.\n\n“Kobe is my favorite player,” Bufkin said. “Just seeing his name on the wall, his pictures of him, it’s cool.”\n\nThat connection isn’t just symbolic. Bufkin often laces up Kobe Bryant signature shoes, occasionally switching to Jayson Tatum’s JT line, but the influence is clear in the way he plays—fearless, aggressive, and relentlessly competitive.\n\nJack Haslett -- The Sporting Tribune\n\nSouth Bay Lakers guard Kobe Bufkin (6) waits for his teammates to help him up during a G-League basketball game between the South Bay Lakers and Memphis Hustle Tuesday, January 6, 2026 at UCLA Health Training Center in El Segendo, Calif.\n\nSince arriving in South Bay, Bufkin has been lighting up the scoreboard, averaging 28.3 points, 5.0 assists, and 4.3 rebounds through his first four regular-season games. Against Memphis, he set the tone early.\n\nBufkin scored 10 points in the first quarter, igniting a Lakers offense that jumped out to a double-digit lead and stretched it to as many as 15 points in the first half. Every time the Hustle tried to close the gap, Bufkin answered.\n\nThe defining sequence came late in the third quarter. Bufkin took an offensive foul on a moving screen, popped right back up, demanded the ball, attacked the lane, floated in a tough finish, absorbed contact, and calmly knocked down the free throw to complete the three-point play for his 20th point of the night. It was a sequence that embodied his mindset—toughness, urgency, and zero hesitation.\n\nBufkin finished with 27 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists in 39 minutes, stuffing the stat sheet while controlling the game’s biggest moments.\n\n“Taking advantage of that, getting my teammates involved,” Bufkin said. “When they weren’t down there protecting the rim, I’m taking it to the rim and making shots.”\n\nThe backcourt pairing of Bufkin and RJ Davis proved overwhelming for Memphis. Davis controlled the pace, organized the offense, and complemented Bufkin’s scoring punch, finishing with 17 points. Together, they kept the Hustle off balance all night.\n\nSouth Bay also received strong contributions across the board. Anton Watson scored 18 points, Tevian Jones added 14, and Kylor Kelley chipped in 13, as all five starters finished in double figures. Off the bench, Arthur Kaluma provided an immediate spark, scoring nine points in the first quarter alone and finishing with 16 points, knocking down all three of his attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nDespite committing 28 turnovers, the Lakers found ways to score, shooting an impressive 16-for-35 (45.7%) from three-point range and building a lead that grew to 16 points in the second half. Defensively, South Bay protected the paint, swatting away 14 shots in the win.\n\n“Something me and RJ gotta talk about,” Bufkin said of the turnovers. “Slowing down, getting to our reads—but yeah, that’s on us.”\n\nEven in victory, accountability remains part of Bufkin’s approach—another trait reminiscent of the name stitched across his chest.\n\nSouth Bay now heads to Austin, Texas for a two-game road trip before returning home to host the San Diego Clippers on January 14. If Bufkin continues on this trajectory, it won’t be long before NBA teams start circling once again.\n\n“There’s been a lot of things that I’ve seen around the league, learning to keep your head down and keep working,” Bufkin said on the noise surrounding his name around the league.\n\nAnother Kobe is rising in South Bay—and this one looks ready for his next shot.",

They should also have a lot more financial flexibility once the new league year arrives since several players' contracts will expire, including that of James, who will make $52.6 million this season.\n\nInsider Marc Stein wrote on his Substack that Los Angeles is willing to sacrifice that flexibility if it acquires a player who will move the needle right now.\n\n\"League sources say that the Lakers continue to scour the trade market in hopes of acquiring a two-way wing with size before the Feb. 5 trade deadline,\" Stein wrote.\n\n\"Two factors, though, continue to work against a trade.\n\n\"1) The market for such wings who can shoot from distance and defend remains quite limited, with New Orleans still resistant to trade interest in both Herb Jones and Trey Murphy III.\n\n\"2) It’s believed that the Lakers are only going to sacrifice their projected financial flexibility in the summer — which is expected to furnish them with the ability to make significant roster changes — only if they can acquire a real needle-mover at the position. Will such a player actually become available over the next four weeks and change?\"\n\nLakers fans are holding out hope that the team can swing a trade for future Hall of Famer Giannis Antetokounmpo sometime between now and the start of next season. But it is unknown how serious L.A. is about trying to land him, or if he would even be available or want to play for the Purple and Gold.\n\nSince such a trade may be unrealistic, the best fans can hope for may be a trade for one or two players who will upgrade the roster in terms of athleticism, defense and 3-point shooting. But that just may be enough to put the Lakers over the top.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers would only sacrifice financial flexibility for 'needle-mover'",

    "fullText": "They met two days prior to Sunday night’s encounter at Crypto.com Arena, a two-game set between the Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies reminiscent of a playoff series.\n\nThe Lakers won the first game Friday night and knew the Grizzlies were going to bring more intensity and a stronger effort even with star guard Ja Morant (right calf contusion) not playing.\n\nAnd that was the case, the Lakers falling behind by 16 points in the second quarter, the Grizzlies ramping it up in a big way. But with Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Jake LaRavia leading the way, the Lakers pulled out a 120-114 win.\n\nDoncic almost had a triple-double with 36 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. James had 26 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. LaRavia, starting in the absence of Rui Hachimura, had 26 points, five rebounds and four assists. It was the second straight time LaRavia, who came in averaging 9.1 points, scored 20-plus.\n\nA back-and-forth game featured several lead changes in the fourth quarter, with the Lakers and Grizzlies taking turns delivering in tense moments. The Lakers finally took the lead for good at 100-99 on a basket by Doncic.\n\nThen James scored on a three-point play and made one of two free throws for a 104-99 lead with 3 minutes 49 seconds left.\n\nThe Lakers (22-11) had an answer for every Grizzlies counter, the final stamp on the game being Doncic’s back-to-back three-pointers for a nine-point lead with 2:01 left.\n\nThe NBA scheduling the Lakers to host the Grizzlies on Friday and again Sunday was not an issue for coach JJ Redick.\n\n“I like it,” Redick said. “I do think it does replicate [the playoffs] in some ways. A playoff series, particularly when it's not a home-and-away situation, but more of you're playing a two-game series on somebody's home court for the day in between. Had a few of these last year. So, I like this for our team and it's a good growth opportunity. Coming off a win, knowing that there's a lot of stuff that we can be better at and where can we make improvements. That's the big challenge to me.”\n\nFor Redick, that meant what it always does for the Lakers — improving on defense.\n\nRedick wanted his team to get back on defense faster and not let the Grizzlies (15-20) get so many early offense opportunities.\n\nThe Lakers also wanted to jump-start center Deandre Ayton from a five-game slumber.\n\nAyton had just four points on two-for-four shooting against the Grizzlies on Friday night and hadn’t scored more than 12 points in that span.\n\nSo, the Lakers went to Ayton at the outset, trying to ignite his game. It worked to a degree, Ayton scoring 15 points, grabbing eight rebounds and blocking three shots.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Luka Dončić keeps Lakers perfect in clutch time originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers swept a weekend back-to-back against the Memphis Grizzlies, capped by Sunday night’s 120-114 win that extended their undefeated mark in clutch games this season.\n\nThe result offered an encouraging sign that LeBron James and Luka Dončić can close games even as the team continues to battle defensive shortcomings.\n\nThe NBA defines clutch time as any situation in which the score is within five points during the final five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime.\n\nEvery team in the league has dropped at least three clutch-time games this season. The Lakers, however, improved to 12-0, including a 2-0 start to the new year against Memphis.\n\nThe contrast has been stark. In games that never reach clutch time, Los Angeles is just 10-11, and the Lakers have shown a tendency to get blown out, particularly against championship contenders.\n\nWith such a small sample size, it’s difficult to draw sweeping conclusions about what consistently works late in games.\n\n“I don’t know what the updated numbers are,” Lakers head coach JJ Redick said before the Memphis series, according to The Athletic. “Our defense has been really good in the clutch.” Redick is usually critical of the Lakers’ defensive performance this season.\n\nOn Sunday, the offense sealed it. Dončić took control late and finished with 36 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, while James added 26 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nThe Lakers will be traveling to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans on Tuesday, a day later they will be in San Antonio to play Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs.",

    "fullText": "It's very obvious to this USC diehard fan, Lincoln Riley is not delivering on his commitment to restore Trojans football to national prominence as head coach.\n\nStop promising better results, hiring new assistant coaches, and commenting on the difficulty of the schedule.\n\nAfter USC lost to unranked Texas Christian in the Alamo Bowl to finish a 9-4 season, coach Lincoln Riley said, \"The arrow is pointing straight up.\" He apparently didn't receive a compass for Christmas.\n\nIf USC plays again in the Alamo Bowl, the Trojans should bring their own officials. ’Nuf said.\n\nAfter losing to TCU in overtime, the Trojans will always \"Remember the Alamo (Bowl).\" With that, the Men of Troy seem to break my heart every football season. Not playing Notre Dame anymore is sacrilegious. Last but not least, Lincoln Riley is an overrated head football coach. Fight On!\n\nThe Ohio State University loses the big playoff game and Ole Miss advances without former coach Lane Kiffin. I imagine millions, like me, hope Ole Miss will win the whole thing without Kiffin.\n\nTimes sports columnist Bill Plaschke appropriately describes how unique and beautiful the Rose Bowl is as a football venue. However, he’s completely off base to advocate for the CFP national championship game to be hosted there. Unmentioned in his column is the fact that Rose Bowl's primary tenant, UCLA, is currently trying to hightail it for the sleek confines of SoFi Stadium. Does Bill really believe that the CFP management committee won’t notice?\n\nOne can add \"lack of class\" to Oregon's ridiculous collection of ugly uniforms based on their performance in the Orange Bowl. Leading 16-0 with less than two minutes in the game while at the Texas Tech two-yard line, the Ducks pushed across an unnecessary touchdown instead of going into the victory formation. Let's hope they get washed out in the semifinals next week.\n\nSorry to see Jerry Neuheisel leave UCLA to join traitor and coaching has-been Chip Kelly at Northwestern. Perhaps young Jerry will skip out after a year — just like his boss does so often.\n\nHaving recently played Detroit, the Rams must have caught a case of \"Dan Campbell-ism\" that is now infecting both the NFL and college games. Definition: Going for it on fourth down while eschewing a 95% likelihood of a made field goal early in the game, all while demonstrating no confidence in your defense. Think those three points would have come in handy at the end of the Rams' loss vs. Atlanta?\n\nThe Rams' consecutive losses recently turned the McVay Rams to the Oy Vay Rams.\n\nThe only positive words for the Lakers that I read in \"Pistons dominate the paint\" by Thuc Nhi Nguyen were, \"The Lakers have eight of their next nine games against teams with losing records.\" That's sad!\n\nThe Lakers coughed the ball up 21 times against the Pistons the other night. I haven't seen that many turnovers since I was at a pastry shop in Solvang.\n\nLuka Doncic is an incredible offensive player. Maybe best in the NBA. But when you’re giving up 20-plus points in layups on the other end, your value drops significantly. “The Trade” was not nearly as lopsided as everyone is saying.\n\nBill Plaschke's New Year's Day column on Los Angeles sports as a saving grace in very difficult times was a home run, touchdown and three-point shot all at one time. Bill had an incredibly difficult 2025, but it was inspirational to read how he was able to get through it with a love of sports getting a huge assist. To carry that theme a bit further, the world can seem so crazy, but following sports can help live and deal with it.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

Happy New Year!\n\nThe Lakers finished December 2025 with a 5-7 record.\n\nAlthough the team was hopeful to find better chemistry with LeBron James back in the mix full-time after his rare absence early on, it simply hasn’t clicked yet for the Lakers.\n\nDefensively, the Lakers have been struggling all season long and they continue to trend in the wrong direction. The head coach, JJ Redick, reached a breaking point, calling out his team for its lack of execution, and the players aren’t exactly pushing back.\n\nThe seven losses occurred against the Phoenix Suns, Boston Celtics, San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Clippers, Houston Rockets, and the Detroit Pistons. Everybody listed is within the postseason picture for the time being, which isn’t a great look for a Lakers team that wants to contend for a title.\n\nThe Lakers are back on the court on Saturday night to take on the Memphis Grizzlies.

    "fullText": "JJ Redick leans on advice from legendary Lakers coach amid losing stretch originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have lost four of their last five games and are approaching the point in the season where many of their flaws need to be addressed. Their 128-106 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday raised questions of whether or not the team has developed an identity yet.\n\nThe Lakers once again were dominated by an opponent's athleticism, and it prompted head coach JJ Redick to reflect on a conversation he had with Hall of Fame Lakers coach Phil Jackson last season.\n\n\"Think about our team last year, this team is different,\" Redick said. \"Our identity will eventually be different. We didn't get that identity until late January, it felt like, and then we had to shift again.\n\n\"I don't think it's unnatural. I remember a meeting I had with Phil last year, pretty early in the season. And he said, 'I always felt like I knew who my team was by Thanksgiving.' I think that's hard to figure out with this team right now.\"\n\nLos Angeles hasn't been afforded the best bill of health this season. As LeBron James pointed out post game when asked a similar question pertaining to the team's identity, the Lakers have only played one or two games with their full roster.\n\nNot only did James miss the first few weeks of the season, but Austin Reaves is now sidelined for at least a month with a calf strain. Promising rookie Adou Thiero is out for a month with an MCL sprain just as he was starting to find his role on the back end of Redick's rotation.\n\nIt's not hard to see why the Lakers have struggled to find an identity through 30 games, even if, as Redick points out, it's a cop-out or excuse. Los Angeles hasn't been healthy enough to even begin laying the foundation of a true identity.",

    "fullText": "Lakers urged to cut ties with declining $101 million superstar before trade deadline originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are slowly slipping into mediocrity.\n\nThe franchise’s horrid defense is holding them back from greatness, as the Detroit Pistons were the latest team to give the 17-time NBA champions fits (they secured a 128-106 victory over the Lakers on Tuesday night).\n\nIn Lake Show Life’s Tyler Watts’ opinion, the Lakers’ declining superstar is also at fault for the organization’s uninspiring play, which should lead to a trade.\n\n“The Lakers have been awful with their three stars sharing the floor this season,” Watts wrote Monday. \"Luka Doncic is locked in as the centerpiece. “Los Angeles has to choose between LeBron (James) and AR (Austin Reaves) for his co-star. Both will be free agents in the offseason, and fans know what makes the most sense.”\n\n“They don’t want to trade Reaves when he’s injured, and LeBron’s value is at an all-time low. Multiple teams would still bite on King James based on the sales alone, but that is not the Laker way.”\n\n“They are known for taking care of their stars and allowing them to retire wearing the purple and gold. The Lakers should move on from LeBron, but that isn’t how they operate.”\n\n“LeBron is 41 years old and clearly declining. The Lakers have been outscored by 7.1 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor this season and have a 125.8 defensive rating. Those numbers are atrocious and resemble nothing near what a title contender puts up.”\n\nUnless James picks it up on the defensive end and shows he can play a more well-rounded brand of basketball moving forward, James will justifiably be considered a shell of his former self.\n\nAlthough a decline was bound to occur with James being the oldest player in the NBA, the 21-time All-Star shouldn’t receive a pass for his lackluster play on the hardwood.\n\nAs Watts noted, James has played well enough to generate sufficient trade interest (a deal would only work if James approved it), which would hypothetically allow the Lakers to acquire roster-bolstering contributors in a blockbuster transaction.\n\nWhether he likes it or not, James isn’t an untouchable asset in Year 23.\n\nMore NBA: Proposed Lakers trade involving LeBron James lands $110 million Warriors superstar",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers halted a three-game losing streak with a win over the Sacramento Kings on Sunday and now look to make it two in a row when they host the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, December 30.\n\nFather Time may be undefeated, but LeBron James is still keeping him at bay. As he celebrates his 41st birthday, my Pistons vs. Lakers predictions and NBA picks anticipate another strong showing from King James.\n\nPistons vs Lakers best bet: LeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists (-115)\n\nLeBron James has played 10 games on his birthday throughout his career, averaging 32.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 6.9 assists, going for at least 35 PRA in every game played on December 30.\n\nSince his streak of double-digit scoring games was snapped on December 4, James has averaged 25.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists across eight games. He’s reached 36 PRA in five of 14 games this season, including four of his last eight.\n\nWith Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, and Rui Hachimura sidelined for the Los Angeles Lakers, James will need to take on a larger role as a scorer, rebounder, and facilitator. Tonight’s tilt with the Detroit Pistons should feature plenty of points, which means additional opportunities for James to stuff the stat sheet.\n\nJames surely understands the gravity of this moment, as he’s playing in a record-setting 23rd season and taking the court, and I expect him to make a statement tonight on his 41st birthday, showing that age is just a number.\n\nThe Lakers are 19-11 to the Over, and the Pistons are 16-15-1 O/U.\n\nLos Angeles has hit the Over in 11 of 13 home games, good for the highest percentage in the Association. The Lakers have gone Over in four of five as the home underdog. Detroit has hit the Over in two of its last three outings, including high-scoring matchups against the Utah Jazz and Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Pistons should be motivated to snap a two-game skid when they visit Crypto.com Arena tonight.\n\nDetroit most recently fell to the Los Angeles Clippers thanks to a career-high 55 points from Kawhi Leonard, and lost to the Utah Jazz on a go-ahead bucket from Keyonte George in the game before that.\n\nWith the Lakers missing several key players, the Pistons have the edge to snap the short losing streak before it gets out of hand.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham is averaging 26.5 points per game this season, and he's hit the Over on this scoring line in 15 of 29 games, including two straight. He's scored 26+ in 10 of 17 games on the road, and he's reached that mark in four of his last six outside of Little Caesars Arena.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham Over 25.5 points\n\nSpread: Pistons -2.5 (-110) | Lakers +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Pistons -140 | Lakers +120\n\nOver/Under: Over 232 (-110) | Under 232 (-110)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have hit the Game Total Over in 34 of their last 55 games (+10.90 Units / 18% ROI).

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen Jayson Tatum went down with an Achilles tendon rupture in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals last season, the Boston Celtics' NBA title defense went with him. Most expected that the Celtics' 2025-26 season would be flushed down the drain too, as Boston awaited their All-NBA forward to return.\n\nBut after 31 games this season, the Celtics are third in the Eastern Conference with a 19-12 record. It is a development that few outside of Boston's locker room saw coming, especially after the Celtics began this season 0-3.\n\nMORE: Jaylen Brown just tied Larry Bird's all-time Celtics record with insane points streak\n\nWhile Tatum has been out, Jaylen Brown has stepped up to play some of the best basketball of his career.\n\nIn year 10, Brown is averaging 29.7 points per game while shooting better than 50 percent from the floor for the first time. Not only is he a lock to make his fifth All-Star team, but Jeff Teague suspects that the quality of Brown's performances will earn him his first All-NBA nod at the end of the season.\n\nOn the Club 520 podcast, Teague argued that Brown has a better first-team All-NBA case than Luka Doncic, the NBA's leading scorer at 33.7 points per game. The former All-Star argued that Doncic is playing on a superior roster with the Los Angeles Lakers relative to who has been surrounding Brown in Boston.\n\n\"They have nothing over there (in Boston),\" Teague said. \"The Celtics were supposed to be a--, bro. I'd give it to him over Luka.\"\n\nJeff Teague says Jaylen Brown Deserves to be first team all NBA over Luka\n\n“He deserves to be 1st team not gonna lie… They have nothing over there.

    "fullText": "The Lakers underwent some soul-searching at practice Saturday, with coach JJ Redick starting the conversation before allowing players to speak freely about the team's issues.\n\nIt was an attempt by Redick and the team to prevent things from spiraling out of control after three consecutive losses.\n\nWhen the Lakers faced the Sacramento Kings on Sunday night at Crypto.com Arena, Redick wanted to see players executing on defense and playing harder.\n\nThe Lakers did exactly that, with Luka Doncic and LeBron James leading the way to a 125-101 win.\n\nFor the Lakers, it was more than Doncic finishing with 34 points, seven assists and five rebounds. It was Doncic playing defense, illustrated best when he blocked a shot by DeMar DeRozan. It was Doncic hustling, such as when he dove to the floor for a loose ball.\n\nIt was more than James scoring 24 points and handing out five assists. It was James throwing down a reverse dunk and offering words of wisdom to teammates.\n\nAnd it also was reserve Nick Smith Jr. finding a role in the rotation and producing, one of the six Lakers scoring in double figures. Smith had 21 points on eight-for-14 shooting, making five of 10 threes.\n\nRui Hachimura had 12 points, Deandre Ayton had 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Jake LaRavia had 11 points.\n\nThe Lakers (20-10) took control from the start of the third quarter, going on a 13-2 run to give them a 26-point lead that reached as high as 30 in the fourth quarter.\n\nGranted, the Kings (8-24) have the second-worst record in the West and were missing injured stars Zach LaVine, Domantas Sabonis and Keegan Bradley, three of their top four scorers.\n\nBut the Lakers lost three straight games because of poor defense and an overall effort that Redick described as \"terrible.\"\n\nAnd with Austin Reaves out for at least a month because of a calf strain, getting the chance to talk through their issues might end up changing the team's fortunes.\n\n\"They're trying, and you know, I told the guys, this is normal,\" Redick said. \"There's very few teams that don't hit troughs throughout the season. It's not all peaks. ... It's just a natural cycle that every team goes through.\n\n\"So we need to identify the problems and then come up with the solutions. So that's just the process that we're in the middle of right now.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Redick believes the Lakers' win against the Kings is their most impressive of the season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers were on a three-game losing streak over the past week, which led head coach J.J. Redick to call out his team. After the Christmas Day loss to the Houston Rockets, it was apparent that the Lakers needed a win.\n\nThey got a solid victory against the Sacramento Kings with a 125-101 result. This was one of the most well-rounded results of the year, as the Lakers won every single quarter. Luka Doncic was excellent once again, while LeBron James had the most efficient performance of his Lakers career.\n\nRedick is correct to be impressed by the performance because they deserve to be praised. The Lakers came into this game against the Kings with a mission, and that is to have a bounce-back night. It was rough for the Lakers to go through that losing stretch, especially since Austin Reaves also suffered an injury.\n\nMoving forward, this could be the model that the Lakers follow, as they want to keep fighting and winning. The game against the Kings was a show of dominance for the Lakers, as Doncic and James took over. Even Nick Smith Jr. had an impressive night filling in for Reaves.\n\nMore: Lakers head coach J.J. Redick sees Nick Smith Jr. playing a big role after Reaves injury\n\n\"We played together, we played for each other. We had probably one of our most consistent games, in terms of 48 minutes of pure competitiveness... This is the first game we've had all year that we've won all four quarters. That says a lot about the approach and the consistent mentality we played tonight,\" Redick said about the performance.\n\nAs long as the Lakers can perform to the highest level on both ends of the floor, they can properly climb the Western Conference standings. It will be a challenging time for the Lakers, as most teams would love to beat them.\n\nWith Doncic and James clicking, the Lakers have become more dangerous. Of course, losing Reaves was big, but the Lakers are becoming known for delivering perfect responses to losses. The Lakers fans would prefer not to lose games, but it was useful because Redick's team learned from their mistakes.\n\nLeBron James Reacts to Russell Westbrook Milestone Before Kings-Lakers\n\nLakers' LeBron James shot a 3-pointer left-handed, and it went as well as you'd expect\n\nJ.J.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers knocked off the Sacramento Kings, 125-101, on Sunday, Dec. 28 behind a 34-point performance from Luka Dončić, including 24 in the first half.\n\nThe Lakers (20-10) were led by Dončić and LeBron James, who added 24 points on 84% shooting from the field. The Kings were playing on consecutive nights, following their win against the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 27.\n\n\"The product that we were putting out there just wasn't there,\" Kings head coach Doug Christie told reporters after the game. \"That obviously starts with me, always. We came in and we weren't grabbing hold and controlling. The level of physicality wasn't to the level that we draw the line in the sand and say this is what it's going to be.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Sacramento was led by DeMar DeRozan, with 22 points, and rookie Maxime Raynaud who recorded a double-double, 16 points and 10 rebounds. Six players scored in double-figures, including Malik Monk, Nique Clifford and Dennis Schröder, who each had 11.\n\nThe Kings shot just 28% from 3-point distance and had 19 turnovers on the evening, which turned into 23 points for the Lakers. Sacramento dropped to 8-24, going into their next game on Tuesday, Dec. 30 in an away game against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\"Our sense of urgency, the ability to have multiple efforts, it just wasn't at the level that it's been at period,\" Christie said. \"We have to make sure that we bounce back versus the Clippers with a high level of energy, effort and intensity, physicality, all of those things.\"\n\nSacramento Kings: News, stats, injuries and more\n\nLebron James hit a pull-up jumper at the top of the key to end the first quarter. It capped a 10-point first quarter for James, as the Lakers led 30-24 after 12 minutes. Luka had nine points.\n\nThe Kings were led by DeMar DeRozan, who scored eight points in the first period.\n\nMalik Monk got going early in the second, hitting on back-to-back three point field goals.\n\nThe Kings allowed the Lakers to get transition baskets including a LeBron James reverse dunk. The Kings got to their spots on offense for timely buckets.\n\nThe deficit grew as the Kings got sloppy with the basketball and threw consecutive turnovers. Luka Doncic scored 15 points in the second quarter. He had 24 total in the first half.\n\nThe Kings trailed 68-53 at the end of the first half.\n\nThe Kings came out lethargic to start the third quarter. A step slow to loose balls, offensively, they looked stagnant.\n\nThe lead grew to 20 before Sacramento head coach Doug Christie called a timeout. Kings trailed 73-53.\n\nThe Lakers had everything going in the third. They knocked down open threes, step back mid-range shots and points in the paint. The biggest lead was 26 for the Lakers.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, Sacramento trailed 99-80.\n\nThe Lakers’ 3-point barrage continued into the fourth quarter. The deficit proved to be too large for the Kings to mount a comeback, the largest lead for the Lakers grew to 30.\n\nSacramento lost by a final score of 125-101.\n\nFrustrate their stars: Sacramento has played scrappy, stifling defense. It's what helped them in their win against Dallas and a big win against Houston on Dec. 21. Keep that same pressure on Lakers stars Luka Dončić and LeBron James and make them uncomfortable. Dončić and James combined for 58 points. James shot 84% from the field.\n\nLean on youth for energy: In the second night of a back-to-back, the Kings should rely on their rookies and young guys to provide energy early and often throughout the game. Look for guys like Keon Ellis, Maxime Raynaud, Dylan Cardwell and Nique Clifford to spark fire. Raynaud tallied a double-double (16 points, 10 rebounds) and Cardwell scored seven points and seven rebounds, while being a +1 on the floor. Clifford scored 11, while Ellis only scored two.\n\nDefend without fouling:As energetic and up-tempo as the Kings are, it's important to defend without fouling as the Lakers are third in the league in free throws made and second in free throws attempted. The Kings had 19 free throw attempts, compared to the Lakers' 18 shots.\n\nHomecoming, revenge tour: It's a homecoming for Los Angeles natives Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan. There's nothing like home cooking. Plus, whenever Westbrook plays his former team or teammates, it feels personal. DeRozan led the team with 22 points but it wasn't enough. Westbrook added 13 points and had six turnovers.\n\nDec. 30 at Los Angeles Clippers\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Kings lose to Lakers on Sunday night: Highlights",

    "fullText": "Lakers' JJ Redick hints at possible lineup change originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are enduring one of the bleakest stretches of their early season, and Thursday's blowout loss to the Houston Rockets may have been the wakeup call head coach JJ Redick and his staff needed to make a change.\n\nRedick came out of Saturday's infamous \"uncomfortable\" practice with enough evidence to seriously consider impactful rotational changes moving forward.\n\n\"In terms of lineups, our guys upstairs have told us 250 minutes is like the sort of target number for when lineup data starts to set and normalize,\" Redick told the media after Saturday's practice. \"So you can look at a lineup (that has played) 11 minutes, 'Oh, look at this 11 minutes!' Yeah, we played small-ball for one game and they played well that game. You can't take a ton from that. But there's certainly trends that we're looking at and we've kind of made some decisions on about where we're gonna go.\"\n\nLos Angeles' most-used lineup this season has been its starting lineup of Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, LeBron James and DeAndre Ayton, which has played seven games and 85 total minutes together. This lineup has also churned out the Lakers' worst plus-minus (-29).\n\nRemoving Reaves, who will be out at least four weeks with a calf strain, and inserting Marcus Smart (a fan-favorite to replace Hachimura should Redick make a change) makes for Los Angeles' second-worst lineup by plus-minus (-28).\n\nLooking through the lineups, there are two common denominators -- Hachimura and James. James will never be benches, which leaves us with Hachimura. If there were ever a change to be made, it would be moving the sharpshooting forward to a bench role in place of more defensive reinforcements.\n\nThe Lakers take on the Sacramento Kings on Sunday.",

    "description": "Coach JJ Redick said he calmly delivered a message to his players that it was time for \"reconnection\" with the team's second-leading scorer sideline at least a month.",
    "fullText": "After the Lakers’ third straight loss Thursday, JJ Redick promised things would get “uncomfortable.” The second-year coach, frustrated after the team delivered a lump of coal in a Christmas Day blowout by the Houston Rockets, said he couldn’t stand to rewatch the same tired story. Leaning his elbow on the table at his postgame news conference, Redick called out players who don’t give enough effort on defense or play hard.\n\nTwo days later he stood in front of reporters with a different tone.\n\n“Recalibration,” Redick said calmly of the message he delivered during Saturday’s team meeting. “Reconnection.”\n\nRedick has cooled, but the Lakers still are under fire. Not only are they trying to snap a season-high three-game losing streak at home Sunday against the Sacramento Kings (6:30 p.m.), but also the Lakers (19-10) still are looking for their first home win in December and must navigate this defining moment without guard Austin Reaves.\n\nReaves was diagnosed with a grade 2 strain in his left calf Friday and will be reevaluated in four weeks. The latest setback comes less than two weeks after he was sidelined because of a “mild” strain in the same calf that kept him out for three games.\n\nReaves is averaging career highs in points (26.6), assists (6.3) and rebounds (5.2) and his ascent from undrafted rookie to potential first-time All-Star was one of the team’s feel-good stories of the season. Reaves scored a career-high 51 points against Sacramento in October, rescuing the Lakers in a game without LeBron James or Luka Doncic and showing Reaves’ potential in a starring role.\n\nNow without their second-leading scorer, the Lakers are looking for their supporting cast to step up.\n\n“We just need our guys to be stars in their roles,” Redick said. “Certainly from a top-end talent standpoint, it diminishes that. But it doesn't change the non-negotiables or how we're trying to play.”\n\nAfter losing the last three games by an average of 20.7 points per game, the Lakers needed to get reacquainted with their non-negotiables during Saturday’s meeting. The session was uncomfortable in the way confronting truth can be uncomfortable, Redick said. It wasn’t just coaches lecturing, but also players speaking up.\n\nThe top priority was creating more clarity, Redick said. The team needed to get back to building its defensive fundamentals after so many lineup changes because of injuries. The Lakers have used 16 different starting lineups in 29 games and have to readjust their rotation again in Reaves’ absence.\n\n“Togetherness is going to have to be emphasized to where it looks like an exaggeration,” center Deandre Ayton said, “where it becomes a habit. And that's what winners do. And it's pretty easy for this team. It's just that there's always a different group out there and we're going to get it for sure.”\n\nForward Rui Hachimura said coaches reminded players of the team’s three pillars that again were displayed on a screen in the practice gym Saturday — championship habits, championship communication, championship shape.\n\n“We just talk about everybody, players, coaches, we just gotta kind of tighten up,” Hachimura said. “We had a good stretch in the beginning and now we kind of, I don't know, we relaxed or we kind of got tired of winning, you know, but we just stopped doing what we're supposed to do.”\n\nThe Lakers are 29th in the NBA in defensive rating in the last 15 games, giving up 122.2 points per 100 possessions. It’s a significant drop from their rating of 113.7 in the first 14 games in which they went 10-4.\n\nSince James returned from, the Lakers’ preferred starting lineup — Doncic, Reaves, James, Ayton and Hachimura — has a net rating of minus-19.9 in seven games.\n\nOffensively the Lakers have lacked organization since James came back, Redick acknowledged. James declined to speak to reporters after practice.\n\n“Too many random possessions,” Redick said. “That's on me.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "ESPN personality Kendrick Perkins said that the time has come for the Lakers to make a bold move with LeBron James.",
    "fullText": "After missing the first 14 games of this season due to sciatica, LeBron James has looked more like his usual self over the last few weeks. In his last seven games, he has averaged 25.6 points, 5.7 rebounds and six assists a contest while shooting 53.3% from the field and 35.3% from 3-point range.\n\nBut his performance on Christmas Day in the Los Angeles Lakers' 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets left something to be desired. He took a modest 13 shot attempts, making seven of them, and ended up with 18 points and five assists. He didn't assert himself that much, and according to one ESPN personality, his body language was poor.\n\nKendrick Perkins said that James' body language was \"awful,\" and he seemed to suggest that the superstar needs to be traded.\n\n\"When he's not engaged or he feels some type of way, it speaks in his body language. Last night his body language was awful. He was not engaged, he was pouting, he was moping, he was walking up and down the damn floor, he was complaining.\n\n\"LeBron and the Lakers -- their relationship has run its course, and they need to figure out a solution and the solution is not him being in a Los Angeles Lakers uniform. ... He knows that this roster is not built. ... He knows that this roster don't have enough.\"\n\nJames does have somewhat of a history of displaying poor body language when things haven't gone well for his team. Right now, things aren't exactly going well for the Lakers.\n\nAfter starting the season 15-4, they have lost six of their last 10 games, and their lackluster defense is being exposed by the rest of the league. Following Thursday's loss, coach JJ Redick publicly called out the lack of effort and execution by his players and accused them of not caring enough.\n\nEven worse, Austin Reaves, who has arguably been playing at a borderline superstar level this season, will now be out for at least four weeks due to a Grade 2 gastrocnemius strain. He recently missed three games due to a left calf strain, and he didn't play in the second half of Thursday's game after experiencing soreness in that same left calf.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Kendrick Perkins says Lakers should make bold LeBron James move",

    "description": "Lakers coach JJ Redick and star guard Luka Doncic say the team must change and get back on track after a 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets Thursday.",
    "fullText": "JJ Redick repeats the same key words after every loss: effort and execution. The Lakers found none of either at Crypto.com Arena on Thursday in a 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets that played out with a plot as familiar as a Hallmark holiday movie.\n\nGetting outhustled by a team that simply played harder with more energy, the Lakers (19-10) dropped their third consecutive game. It’s their longest losing streak of the season and left the team questioning its identity.\n\n“I don't know what has to change,” said guard Luka Doncic, who led the Lakers with 25 points and seven assists, but had six turnovers. “But definitely something needs to change.”\n\nHere are three takeaways from the loss:\n\nWhen the Lakers were climbing up the Western Conference standings, improbably winning games with LeBron James and Luka Doncic injured and celebrating Austin Reaves’ 51-point performance and ascent into stardom, the vibes were high. Players jumped off the bench to cheer for each other. They championed team bonding exercises such as slideshow presentations that introduced themselves to each other and a field trip to a Porsche driving experience. It all felt surprisingly easy, especially for a team that had several new additions.\n\n“We had it,” Redick said wistfully Thursday. “We had it. I always say this about culture, I always say this about a good team being a functioning organism.”\n\n“It can change like that,” he continued. “We don’t have it right now.”\n\nAll three of the Lakers’ most recent losses have been blowouts. With an average margin of defeat of 20.7 points, their total point differential has dropped to minus-15 on the season, which ranks 16th in the NBA.\n\nForward Jake LaRavia said in the locker room that there felt like a “disconnect” on the team, but couldn’t verbalize more about how things had turned so suddenly. The team’s seven-game winning streak at the end of November feels like a distant memory, although it should serve as a constant reminder of how a team shouldn’t let its guard down, especially when it was just collecting wins off teams with losing records.\n\n“This [has] kind of been the trending thing even when we were winning,” forward Jarred Vanderbilt said. “Obviously wins kinda shadow a lot of stuff. But it's been the same pretty much all year of how we finished games, lose games: transition defense, rebounding and stuff like that. It's been a trend all year.\"\n\nLeBron James, who played in his 13th game this season after missing the first 14 games because of sciatica, had 18 points and five assists and declined to speak with reporters after the game, along with Marcus Smart (six points, two rebounds) and Rui Hachimura (zero points, two assists).\n\nTo further exasperate the lingering injury bug, Reaves left the game after the first half because of left calf soreness. It was the same calf that sidelined him for three games last week.\n\nVanderbilt was one of the few bright spots for the Lakers, finishing with eight points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal. His energy off the bench in the second quarter, especially when playing with Smart, who fought through a right shoulder injury, helped the Lakers force four turnovers in a five-minute stretch. Vanderbilt’s three-pointer with 4:16 remaining in the second that trimmed the lead to four was one of the few moments that made the mostly apathetic holiday crowd roar.\n\nVanderbilt’s offensive deficiencies were the primary reason he fell out of the rotation for 10 games, but since returning to the lineup regularly against Phoenix on Dec. 14, Vanderbilt has made seven of 13 three-pointers in five games, including three for four on Thursday. It was his first game as a Laker with three made threes.\n\nOutside of LaRavia, who stayed on the court after both teams had otherwise emptied the bench, Vanderbilt was the only Laker who had a positive plus-minus. The Lakers outscored the Rockets by five in Vanderbilt’s 26 minutes and 23 seconds on the floor.\n\n“I feel like I try to come in the game and bring that energy and hoping guys could feed off it,” Vanderbilt said. “But we need to play [like] that for 48 minutes. … We just got to dig deep and want to do it.”\n\nThe Rockets (18-10) are not just the NBA’s best rebounding team, but they could be the best in a generation. The team’s 55.6% rebounding rate is the best in the NBA on record since at least the 1996-97 season.\n\nHouston’s dominance on the boards was at the top of Redick’s mind before the game when he estimated the Rockets were the best rebounding team since the 1994-95 Mavericks. He emphasized the importance of gang rebounding against a team known for its physically imposing double-big lineup and athletic wings.\n\nThen the Rockets grabbed two offensive rebounds in their first two possessions. The Rockets outrebounded the Lakers 48-25, the Lakers’ largest rebounding deficit since Nov. 8, 2023, which was also against Houston. Houston had 17 offensive rebounds, only one fewer than the Lakers’ defensive rebounding total, and with 12 rebounds, center Alpren Sengun matched the Lakers’ entire starting lineup on the boards.\n\n“Everybody gotta give better effort,” Doncic said, “starting with me.”\n\nDoncic had five rebounds, tied with Vanderbilt for the team lead. Center Deandre Ayton had just two boards and 10 points in 36 minutes and 17 seconds. It was the 7-footer’s lowet rebounding total of the season.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

The Purple and Gold never managed to bounce back, suffering their third straight defeat.\n\nAfter the game, Doncic was an image of frustration. He, however, admitted that he was accountable for their loss.\n\n“Everyone has to give better effort, starting with me,” said the 26-year-old star, as quoted by The Athletic’s Dan Woike.\n\nDoncic tallied 25 points on 9-of-17 shooting, five rebounds, and seven assists. He also had a game-high six turnovers.\n\nLeBron James added 18 points, five rebounds, and two steals. Austin Reaves, meanwhile, had to be pulled out early in the game after reaggravating his calf injury. He had 12 points in 15 minutes.\n\nLos Angeles allowed Houston to shoot 53% from the field and got outrebounded, 48-25. The Rockets scored 23 points off the 16 turnovers of the Lakers.\n\nThe 26-year-old Doncic has said he needs to regain the defensive effort he showed in the first few games of the season. He has been slowed down by injuries as of late, but it shouldn’t be an excuse for a perennial All-Star to play lackadaisically.\n\nLakers coach JJ Redick has repeatedly rhapsodized about making a complete effort on both ends, and as Doncic acknowledged, he should be the one setting an example for everyone.\n\nThe Lakers fell to 19-10, including 7-5 at home.",

    "fullText": "JJ Redick rips Lakers with 4-word message after brutal Rockets loss appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nLOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles Lakers’ current losing streak hit three games following their 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day. For the Lakers, there are plenty of issues to discuss in regards to their poor play as of late. But for head coach JJ Redick, the ultimate reason for the team’s recent stretch can be summed up in four simple words.\n\n“We don’t care enough,” Redick said following the Lakers’ Christmas Day loss to the Rockets. “And that’s the part that bothers me a lot. We don’t care enough to do the things that are necessary, and we don’t care enough to be a professional. We had it, we had it. I always say this about culture, I always say this about a good team being a functioning organism, it can change like that. We don’t have it right now.”\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Lakers were a step slower than the Rockets on both ends of the court. They found themselves trailing by double digits early in the first quarter, 18-8, and by the end of the period they were down 37-25.\n\nIt was still a double digit deficit at halftime, and the second half didn’t get any better with the Rockets’ lead ballooning to 20 points almost midway through the third quarter. The Lakers couldn’t rebound, they couldn’t get stops and they couldn’t string together enough consistency offensively. To make matters worse, Austin Reaves was ruled out for the second half due to his ongoing calf injury. In the first half, Reaves had been the only consistent offensive threat for the team.\n\nJJ Redick didn’t hold back words when summing up what kind of team the Lakers are right now, while acknowledging that he told the team postgame to expect an uncomfortable practice this weekend.\n\n“The two words of the day were effort and execution. I feel like when we’ve done both those things at a high level, we’ve been a good basketball team,” Redick said. “When we haven’t, we’re a terrible basketball team, and tonight we were a terrible basketball team. That started legitimately right away.”\n\nThe Lakers were outrebounded by the Rockets, 48-25. They allowed 24 second chance points compared to their 10, and 16 fastbreak points compared to their 11.\n\nTuesday’s loss against the Phoenix Suns was the first time this season that the Lakers had lost consecutive games. Redick had vowed that the Lakers would have the right mentality on Christmas, but that was not the case. The Lakers’ next opportunity to get back in the win column is Sunday, Dec. 28 as the Sacramento Kings come to town.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick was not in a charitable mood after the team’s 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day.\n\nThe team took its third straight loss Thursday in a one-sided affair, an outcome made worse by rising star Austin Reaves exiting the game with another calf injury. The Rockets led by double-digits for the entire second half and outrebounded the Lakers 48-25.\n\nAfter the game, Redick railed against his team’s effort level and bluntly assessed how it performed:\n\n“The two words of the day were ‘effort’ and ‘execution.’ I feel like when we’ve done both of those things at a high level, we’ve been a good basketball team. When we haven’t, we’re a terrible basketball team. And tonight, we were a terrible basketball team.”\n\nHe went on to note the team’s next practice Saturday will not be a fun one for certain players, whose consistency he is directly questioning:\n\n“We don’t care enough right now. That’s the part that bothers me a lot. We don’t care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don’t care enough to be professional.\n\nIt’s a matter of making the choice, and too often we have guys that don’t want to make that choice. It’s pretty consistent who those guys are. Saturday’s practice, I told the guys, it’s going to be uncomfortable. Meeting is going to be uncomfortable. I’m not doing another 53 games like this.”\n\nThat choice calls back to what Redick said after the Lakers’ previous loss to the Phoenix Suns, in which he painted the team’s defensive effort as a series of choices it wasn’t making correctly.\n\nHis full postgame conference Thursday:\n\nJJ Redick went scorched earth on the Lakers postgame. pic.twitter.com/ZLuOKyqMBQ\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) December 26, 2025\n\nThe Lakers have spent nearly the entire season on solid footing despite LeBron James’ early season absence, but now sit at 19-10, good for only fifth place in the Western Conference. The team can only hope Reaves isn’t further injured after missing three games last week with a calf strain, but it has other problems to figure out now.\n\nThe Lakers’ next chance to get back on track will be a Sunday home game against the Sacramento Kings, who currently hold the worst record in the West at 7-23.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Something has to change with the Lakers.\n\nThat was the feeling most Lakers fans had as they exited Crypto.com Arena early on Christmas, hoping to beat traffic after a third straight blowout loss. It was a sentiment echoed loudly by Lakers coach JJ Redick after the final buzzer and one likely to be shared by general manager Rob Pelinka soon enough.\n\n“We don’t care enough right now,” Redick said. “That’s the part that bothers you a lot. We don’t care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don’t care enough to be professional. We don’t care enough to be professional.”\n\n“It’s a matter of making the choice, and far too often we don’t have guys who want to make that choice,” Redick added while previewing the team’s next practice. “And it’s pretty consistent who those guys are. Saturday’s practice, I told the guys, is going to be uncomfortable. The meeting is going to be uncomfortable. I’m not doing another 53 games like this.”\n\nJJ Redick went scorched earth on the Lakers postgame. pic.twitter.com/ZLuOKyqMBQ\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) December 26, 2025\n\nFor a franchise that entered the season believing it had solved its championship formula, Christmas offered a brutal reality check.\n\nThe NBA trade deadline is February 5, 2026 — 41 days from the moment the Lakers exited the court Thursday following a 119–96 loss to the Houston Rockets. It marked their longest losing streak of the season, a stunning reversal for a team that hadn’t even lost consecutive games before last Saturday.\n\nThat night, the Clippers handed them a 103–88 loss. On Tuesday, the Phoenix Suns obliterated them 132–88. On Thursday, the Rockets delivered the third punch of a six-day stretch that has reframed the Lakers’ season and exposed their ceiling.\n\nThis is not a championship team as currently constructed.\n\nYes, they started 15–4 and looked like a contender through 19 games. But as Stan Van Gundy told me at the NBA Cup, numbers eventually win every argument.\n\n“I don’t think they’re a true contender, in my opinion,” Van Gundy said  “Their numbers said they were mediocre. Their record said they were really good. I just don’t think in today’s game they have enough.”\n\n“They don’t have the depth, they don’t have the speed and quickness to keep up right now,” Van Gundy continued. “Defensively, they even get weaker when their three best players play together.”\n\nHe was referring to the Lakers’ high-usage trio — Luka Dončić, LeBron James, and Austin Reaves — a combination that has repeatedly failed to defend young, fast, perimeter-driven teams. Against Houston, those stars once again shared the floor alongside starters Deandre Ayton and Rui Hachimura. The result was predictable.\n\nThe Lakers’ starting lineup was a -14 in just over eight minutes in the first half with a defensive rating of 144.4. Entering the game, that unit posted a 113 offensive rating, 122 defensive rating, and a -9 net rating this season.\n\n“When they had the mix of two of those guys (they were better).” Van Gundy said of the Lakers when they played without one of their stars. “Now JJ will obviously rotate those guys, but they’re going to come down the stretch in games, and those three guys are all going to be out there and Ayton will be out there and now you can’t get perimeter defenders out there with them. I think it’s a struggle and JJ and his staff have a huge challenge in front of them.”\n\nJames' Rich Paul said it first when he claimed the Lakers weren't a contender on his podcast two weeks ago. Van Gundy validated it. And the last 72 hours have cemented it.\n\nThe Lakers are 19–10 — fifth in the West, just ahead of the Rockets and the Suns, two teams that dismantled them. National hype can cloak flaws for only so long. The Lakers’ fatal flaw is now their defining one:\n\nThey cannot defend young, fast teams, and no team wins in the postseason giving up 120 points a night.\n\nThe Lakers don’t need another superstar. They have that box checked with Dončić. They still get All-NBA moments from LeBron. They’ll likely send Reaves to his first All-Star Game. But stars without an identity — without depth, speed, or defensive toughness — are just names on a marquee, not threats in a playoff series.\n\n“I can’t picture them on OKC’s level,” Van Gundy said. “Denver, San Antonio, Houston are probably the next three teams, and I don’t see the Lakers at that level.”\n\nThe good news? There’s still time for Pelinka to fix what ails them. The bad news? Time is the only thing they have. And if urgency, pride, and professionalism don’t arrive soon, it won’t matter who sits in uncomfortable practices or who speaks into a microphone next.\n\nThe Lakers’ biggest issue isn’t schematic, roster-based, or philosophical.\n\nIt’s effort. It’s identity. It’s caring enough.\n\nAnd right now, they simply don’t.",

    "description": "Here are three reasons why the Lakers were thrashed on Christmas Day.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets celebrated Christmas in style, delivering an overwhelming and dominant outing in a 119-96 thrashing of the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday.\n\nAmen Thompson led six Rockets in double figures with 26 points in the win, which ended a brutal six-game road trip — three overtime losses plus a 20-point blowout at the hands of the woeful Clippers — on a strong note to improve to 18-10 on the season. Luka Dončić scored a team-high 25 points for the Lakers, but also committed six of their 16 turnovers in a game L.A. never led, and in which Dončić, LeBron James and Co. only briefly even appeared competitive.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the Rockets’ commanding performance at Crypto.com Arena:\n\nAfter consecutive blowout losses to the Clippers and Suns, L.A. head coach JJ Redick offered a curt reply to an inquiry as to whether his Lakers — who entered Christmas ranked 25th in defensive efficiency — had shown enough of a willingness to dig in and grind it out on the less glamorous end of the floor:\n\nReporter: \"Does this group have enough guys who make the choice to play hard (like many guys on Phoenix eg. Goodwin)?\"\n\nJJ Redick: \"No.\"\n\n— Lakers Daily (@LakersDailyCom) December 24, 2025\n\nL.A. brought a similar flavor of indifference for much of its Christmas Day matchup with Houston. The Lakers repeatedly allowed Rockets ball-handlers to beat them at the point of attack, get into the paint and generate good look after good look, seemingly whenever and wherever they wanted:\n\nAmen Thompson with the speedy layup and then the Alley-oop dunk off a lob by Alperen Sengun (with a replay) pic.twitter.com/bVKRE8aCr0\n\n— MrBuckBuck (@MrBuckBuckNBA) December 26, 2025\n\nHouston barely needed five minutes of game time to build a double-figure lead that it would never relinquish, ending the opening frame with 37 points on 24 possessions — a torrid 154.2 offensive rating. For reference, the best offense in the NBA, the Denver Nuggets, scores 125.6 points-per-100.\n\n“The two words of the day were ‘effort’ and ‘execution,’” Redick said after the game. “I feel like when we’ve done both of those things at a high level, we’ve been a good basketball team, and when we haven’t, we’re a terrible basketball team. And tonight, we were a terrible basketball team. And that started, legitimately, right away.”\n\nWhen the Lakers briefly made a push midway through the second quarter, cutting the deficit to four at 48-44 following 3-pointers by Dončić and Jarred Vanderbilt, the Rockets calmly stuck to their guns, scored 15 points in the next three minutes and pushed the lead back to 10 at halftime. After the Rockets opened the third quarter with buckets on four straight possessions, Redick shifted tactics and dialed up a zone, which resulted in a pair of stops … which Houston promptly rendered irrelevant by grabbing offensive rebounds, scoring second-chance points and extending its lead even further.\n\nRedick rifled through his Rolodex in search of different combinations that might offer a level of physicality and defensive activity that could short-circuit Houston’s smoothly operating machine. The combo of Vanderbilt and Marcus Smart helped key an 11-4 second-quarter run that constituted L.A.’s best basketball of the night; a unit flanking Dončić and whisper-quiet center Deandre Ayton with Vanderbilt, Smart, gap-plugging connector Jake LaRavia (one that had played just 10 possessions together all season prior to Thursday) showed intermittent sparks.\n\nFor the most part, though, the Lakers’ Christmas fizzle looked remarkably similar to their Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals loss to the San Antonio Spurs: a team top-heavy with scoring skill but light on size, athleticism and defensive steel proving unable — or unwilling — to hang with a younger, stronger, more physical and more relentless opponent.\n\n“We don’t care enough right now,” Redick said. “That’s the part that bothers you a lot. We don’t care enough to, like, do the things that are necessary. We don’t care enough to be a professional. We had it. We had it. I always say this about culture, I always say this about a team being a functioning organism: It can change like that. We don’t have it right now.”\n\nWhat the Lakers do have, in Dončić, James and Austin Reaves (who sat out the second half with what the Lakers called left calf soreness, a worrying note considering he just missed three games with a calf strain) is enough high-end scoring and playmaking to produce a top-flight offense. If they can’t provide a higher class of resistance against similarly skilled opponents, though, that won’t be enough — especially not if the goal is to make a deep postseason run in this Western Conference.\n\n“It’s a matter of making the choice, and too often, we have guys who don’t want to make that choice,” Redick said. “And it’s pretty consistent who those guys are. I told the guys: Saturday’s practice is going to be uncomfortable. The meeting is going to be uncomfortable. I’m not doing another 53 games like this.”\n\nComing into Christmas Day, the Rockets were the NBA’s sixth-best team at winning the possession battle on a night-to-night basis, according to analysis by Jared Dubin at Last Night in Basketball, averaging three more offensive trips per game than their opponents. They pressed that advantage early and often Thursday, pulling down four offensive rebounds against some lackadaisical Lakers boxouts and forcing six turnovers in the first quarter alone.\n\nThat allowed them to take five more shots than L.A. in the opening stanza — a key factor in the Rockets opening that early double-digit lead and keeping the Lakers at arm’s length.\n\n17 offensive rebounds for Houston — an obscene 55.6% offensive rebounding rate, per @cleantheglass — and 24 second-chance points. The Rockets do this to everybody, but the defensive rebounding just wasn't even close to good enough for the Lakers. pic.twitter.com/kGMysOf9Nr\n\n— Dan Devine (@YourManDevine) December 26, 2025\n\nThe Rockets finished with nearly as many offensive rebounds (17) as the Lakers had defensive rebounds (18) and monster edges in second-chance points (24-10), points off turnovers (23-11), points scored per possession in transition (1.33 to 1.13) and total field-goal attempts (90-77). Getting that many more bites at the apple, and capitalizing on them so effectively, is how the Rockets can shrug off 25 from Luka and the Lakers shooting 50.6% as a team overall — and how a Houston team that takes fewer 3-pointers per game than any other squad in the NBA can still boast one of the league’s most potent and efficient attacks.\n\nWhen they’re at their best, the Rockets come at you in waves on the offensive end. It’s Thompson (26 points on 12-for-19 shooting with five assists) repeatedly getting downhill into the paint, and Alperen Şengün (14 points, 12 rebounds, four assists) meanspiritedly pirouetting his way into all manner of infuriating flip shots and needle-threading drop-offs, and Kevin Durant (25 points on 8-for-14 shooting, eight assists) barely seeming to break a sweat as he gets to his preferred spots in the midrange or pops a trail 3 in an unsuspecting defender’s eye.\n\nWhen they’re really scary, it’s because those headliners have help: Jabari Smith Jr. (16 points on nine shots) drilling jumpers spotting up and running off pindowns, Reed Sheppard (13 points, 5-for-10 from the floor) snaking the pick-and-roll to get to CP3-style elbow pull-ups in rhythm, and Tari Eason — an absolute menace on both ends of the court, just fully Grinching it up — ripping and running and terrorizing.\n\n7 quick points for Tari Eason pic.twitter.com/rsnFfX1BBL\n\n— MrBuckBuck (@MrBuckBuckNBA) December 26, 2025\n\nAmen Thompson with the alley-oop dunk off a lob by Kevin Durant to put the Rockets up 22 (with replays) pic.twitter.com/25gOMqUmrY\n\n— MrBuckBuck (@MrBuckBuckNBA) December 26, 2025\n\nOn some nights, the lack of a proper half-court organizer of a point guard will rear its ugly head; on others, though, the sheer tonnage of Houston’s athleticism, ferocity and talent will dispense with any such concerns. On those nights, these Rockets can straight up run you out of your gym. Ask the Lakers. They can tell you all about it.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers’ losing streak continued with an NBA Christmas Day slate loss against the Houston Rockets.\n\nWith an opportunity to prove they are one of the top contenders in the Western Conference on the primetime stage, the Lakers fell flat. Shortly after the game wrapped up, the outspoken former NBA veteran Kendrick Perkins offered the Lakers a piece of his mind.\n\n“Again, the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka,” Perkins wrote on social media.\n\n“He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.”\n\nAgain the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka. He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.\n\n— Kendrick Perkins (@KendrickPerkins) December 26, 2025\n\nDoncic checked in for 34 minutes of action on Thursday night. He went 9-17 from the field and attempted seven shots from the charity stripe. Doncic scored a game-high of 25 points, while coming down with five rebounds, and producing seven assists.\n\nHe also turned the ball over six times, more than any other player involved, and finished the game as a minus-25.\n\nThe Lakers were blown out with a score of 119-96. With that loss, they dropped to three straight defeats. Now, the Lakers are 19-10 on the year, slipping to fifth in the Western Conference standings. The victory for Houston allowed the Rockets to pull within half a game of the Lakers.\n\nDoncic and the Lakers aren’t in panic mode, but it’s clear that the coaching staff is growing frustrated with the team’s lack of execution, especially on the defensive end. It’s something that JJ Redick shined a light on earlier this week after the Lakers lost to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn Thursday night, Redick surely didn’t hold back. After Doncic and the Lakers get a day off on Friday, they’ll be back on the practice court for what Redick describes as an “uncomfortable” practice and film session. The Lakers will get a chance to bounce back against the struggling Sacramento Kings on Sunday.\n\nBetween the public pressure from analysts such as Perkins—and the brutally honest assessment from Redick—Doncic and the Lakers have a lot riding on them over the next couple of days. A comfortable win over the Kings could help them get back on the right track. Soon, the hoops world will see how the Lakers respond.",

His return was welcomed by the Rockets pressuring him and trying to speed him up constantly 94 feet, scoring all his points in the first three quarters and going scoreless in the fourth.\n\n\"I don't know what has to change, but definitely something needs to change,\" Dončić said surrounding the team. \"We got to figure it out; that's the thing we have [to do]. Everybody got to talk about it. I know JJ said it's going to be uncomfortable. As it should be.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, the Lakers lost Austin Reaves before they could reach halftime. A calf injury, the same one that's been keeping him out of the rotation lately, led to an early exit for Reaves as he finished with 12 points in 14 minutes.\n\nLeBron James finished with 18 points (five rebounds) on seven-of-13 shooting.\n\nBefore their next game, on Sunday at home against the Kings, the Lakers will have a practice on Saturday and Redick confirmed it will be a practice that is not going to be comfortable following their biggest home loss of the season.\n\n\"It's a matter of making the choice and far too often we don't have guys who want to make that choice.\" Redick said, \"It's pretty consistent who those guys are.  Saturday's practice is going to be uncomfortable. I'm not doing another 53 games like this.\"",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES –– 'Twas Christmas night in crypto.com, and throughout the arena,\n\nNot a Laker was hustling, not even the cleaners.\n\nThe stockings were hung by the locker room bare.\n\nIn hopes that some effort soon would be there.\n\nThe fans nestled snug in their purple and gold,\n\nWhile nightmares of turnovers danced in the cold.\n\nLeBron James, in his jersey, and the coach in a tracksuit,\n\nHad just settled into a nightmarish pursuit.\n\nWhen out on the court, there arose such a clatter,\n\nThe Rockets were scoring — it was really the latter.\n\nAway to the basket they flew like a flash,\n\nWhile the Lakers stood statuesque, lacking the dash.\n\nThe scoreboard was gleaming, a 23-point lead,\n\nThe Lakers were flailing, consumed by their greed.\n\nFor offense alone was their singular quest,\n\nDefense forgotten, like an old Memphis Grizzlies' vest.\n\nAmen Thompson scored 26, a virtuoso display,\n\nKevin Durant added 25, in his methodical way.\n\nAlperen Sengun grabbed 12 boards, more than L.A.'s whole starting five,\n\nWhile the Lakers played basketball barely alive.\n\nJames scored just 18, his impact a crater,\n\nMinus-33 while on the court—the data can't cater.\n\nLuka Dončić added 25, but the turnovers combined,\n\nNine between the two, the Rockets would find.\n\nThe Rockets led 63-53 at the half,\n\nWhile James had eight points—eight too few by math.\n\nThe third quarter opened with an 18-5 run,\n\nThe Lakers surrendered; their will came undone.\n\n\"They scored on the first 13 possessions,\" JJ Redick said, his voice thin,\n\n\"Effort and execution — we were terrible within.\"\n\nThe coach's frustration, a palpable thing,\n\n\"We don't care enough right now,\" Redick said, like a king.\n\nCare. That word hung in the locker room air,\n\nA concept as foreign as playoff hardware.\n\n\"We had it,\" Redick continued, his voice dropping low,\n\n\"This culture can change like that,\" he said, snapping just so.\n\nThe numbers are damning, the analytics clear,\n\nA 26-point swing in net rating—oh dear.\n\nWith Smart, they were +13.5, just humming along,\n\nWith James, they've plummeted, -13.1 dead wrong.\n\nThe Lakers were 15-4 in their first 19 games,\n\nThey played with connection; they played like bright flames.\n\nThen James returned, and the schedule grew tough,\n\nNow 4-6 in ten games—is that enough?\n\n\"Is the care factor coachable?\" one reporter inquired,\n\n\"Or is it something you either have or you're tired?\"\n\nRedick paused, considering the question's sharp edge,\n\n\"Guys say they want to win,\" he said, standing on the ledge.\n\n\"The care factor is: do I care enough to do what I'm supposed to?\"\n\nRedick spoke of championship habits, of being closely attuned.\n\n\"That's what we don't have right now,\" Redick said, plain as day,\n\n\"And it's pretty consistent who those guys are,\" in a tone that betrayed.\n\nTheir defense was 14th before James' return,\n\nNow 25th and falling, a concern that burns.\n\nThis team held under 100—the Bucks, in a win,\n\nJames played sub-10 minutes; the lesson sinks in.\n\nThe body language told stories that box scores can't capture,\n\nA shrug, a half-jog, a laugh with the opposition's rapture.\n\nWhile Redick screamed rotations, while fans screamed dismay,\n\nJames seemed to whisper, \"It's just another day.\"\n\n\"We practice them all the time,\" Redick said of his schemes,\n\n\"It's a matter of making the choice,\" he said in a shattering of dreams.\n\n\"Too often we have guys that don't want to make that choice,\"\n\nRedick's voice was a scalpel; his words had a voice.\n\n\"Saturday's practice,\" Redick warned, \"will be uncomfortable.\n\nThe meeting will be uncomfortable. I'm not doing another 53 games like this.\"\n\nThe coach at his wits' end, a season on the brink,\n\nA roster of talent, yet unable to think.\n\nMarcus Smart spoke of leadership, of leading by example,\n\n\"Putting my body on the line,\" Smart said, ample.\n\nBut who follows? Who listens? Who makes the hard choice?\n\nWhen the star of the show uses his aged, selective voice?\n\nThe Rockets were 7-7 on the road, now improved,\n\nThe Lakers were exposed, their problems removed.\n\nFrom the shadows of \"potential\" and \"we'll be fine soon,\"\n\nInto harsh Christmas daylight, beneath a December moon.\n\nAustin Reaves left at halftime, a calf strain again,\n\n12 points in 16 minutes, then gone from the din.\n\n\"Not my decision,\" Redick said of the medical call,\n\nBut the fragility showed—they could not afford to fall.\n\nYet fall they did, and fall they keep falling,\n\nA team that once soared is now merely crawling.\n\nThe answer isn't straightforward; both require nuance,\n\nThe defense will be bad, with or without James' entrance.\n\nBut the offense was balanced when James was the third option,\n\nOnce his usage increased, the team lost its traction.\n\nJames picks and chooses his moments on D,\n\nWhile teammates stand static, failing to see.\n\nThe greatest present James could give, some fans dare to say,\n\nIs James waiving his no-trade clause and going away.\n\nThe greatest gift the Lakers could give, in return,\n\nIs youth and assets, for the fifth title King James yearns.\n\nBut Christmas comes in miracles, through hope and for cheer,\n\nNot in radioactive locker rooms, and indeed, not through fear.\n\nYet here stand the Lakers, tradition in tow,\n\nTheir 52nd Christmas game, and 27th blow.\n\nJared Vanderbilt flashed, and Smart showed some fight,\n\nBut rotations are fickle, your stars aren't quite right.\n\nThe problem is bigger than one man's plus-minus,\n\nIt's systemic, it's cultural, it's all of us.\n\nThe Rockets scored 119, the Lakers just 96,\n\nA 23-point margin, a holiday fix.\n\nThe fans left early, the stadium cleared,\n\nAnother Christmas ruined, another loss leered.\n\n\"We've got to be better,\" Smart said, simple and true,\n\n\"Stuff like that can't happen,\" of course, Smart knew.\n\nBut knowing and doing are different beasts,\n\nOne requires thought, the other, release.\n\nSo 'twas the night of Christmas, in Lakerland gloom,\n\nA season once promising is now facing doom.\n\nThe questions hang heavy, the answers seem far,\n\nWho are these Lakers? Who are they, these stars?\n\nA team with no energy, a team with no fight,\n\nA team that once dazzled now fades into the night.\n\nThe desert revealed them, the Rockets exposed,\n\nThe truth is now out there; the door is now closed.\n\nYet doors can reopen, can swing both ways,\n\nCan welcome the morning, can brighten the days.\n\nBut first must come honesty, hard choices made,\n\nChampionship habits cannot be outweighed.\n\nThe Lakers have talent, the Lakers have names,\n\nBut talent alone wins no playoff games.\n\nIt takes five guys moving; it takes trust and belief.\n\nIt takes caring enough to embrace the complicated grief.\n\nSo on this December night, as the chill falls on nowhere,\n\nAs palm trees stand silent beneath the thick air,\n\nThe Lakers face Christmas with coal in their socks,\n\nA team that must look in the mirror and talk.\n\nAbout who they are, about what they will be,\n\nAbout giving effort, about setting free\n\nThe potential they've bottled, the promise they've sold,\n\nBefore this whole season turns purple to mold.",

    "title": "'A million choices': Lakers' defense will get a Christmas Day test vs. Rockets",
    "description": "Coach JJ Redick says the Lakers will not make all the correct choices, but \"can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.\"",
    "fullText": "It’s not the lineups, the injuries or necessarily the system. The cause of the Lakers' defensive demise is a thousand little decisions gone wrong.\n\n“It comes down to just making the choice,” coach JJ Redick said after the Lakers gave up 132 points in a blowout loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday. “It's making the choice. There's shortcuts you can take or you can do the hard thing and you can make the second effort or you can sprint back or you can't. It's just a choice and there's a million choices in a game, and you're very likely not gonna make every choice correctly. But can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.”\n\nComing off back-to-back losses for the first time this season, the Lakers (19-9) are ranked 28th in defensive rating in the last 14 games entering a Christmas Day showcase against the Houston Rockets at 5 p.m. PST at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers, without any individual shutdown defenders, need a perfectly executed team defense to compete. But 15 different starting lineups in 28 games has delayed some of the team's ability to build continuity. The Lakers have had their full complement of 14 standard contract players for two games.\n\nForward Rui Hachimura (groin) and Luka Doncic (leg) could return Thursday. Guard Gabe Vincent, one of the team’s top defensive options on the perimeter, will miss his fourth game with lower-back soreness. Center Jaxson Hayes tweaked his left ankle in the second quarter of Tuesday’s loss and didn’t return.\n\nThe Rockets (17-10) limp into the Christmas Day blockbuster with their own struggles. The team thought to be one of the few who could challenge Oklahoma City in the West has lost five of its last seven games. Three of the losses were in overtime and four came against teams currently out of the play-in picture, including Tuesday’s loss to the Clippers.\n\nLed by Kevin Durant’s 25.2 points, the Rockets are a statistical anomaly in the sped up, possession-maximizing modern NBA. They have the third-ranked offense in the league despite being one of the slowest. They shoot the fewest three-pointers per game, but make them at a 40% clip that ranks second, and dominate the glass with NBA-leading 48.7 rebounds and 16.1 offensive rebounds per game.\n\nHouston’s physicality and expertise on the boards could be especially worrisome for a team that still has to consciously choose defense on a possession-by-possession basis instead of consistently living up to a standard of playing hard.\n\n“There's really no defense, no scheme we can do when we're giving up offensive rebounds in crucial moments like we are, our [opponents] are getting wherever they want on the court,” guard Marcus Smart said after Tuesday’s loss. “And there's no help, there's no resistance, there's no urgency. … It's on us.”\n\nThe Suns grabbed 12 offensive rebounds against the Lakers on 35 missed shots, an offensive rebounding rate of 34.3%. After the Suns scored a three-pointer by twice grabbing offensive rebounds off tipped balls, Lakers players had an animated discussion in a timeout with Smart was gesturing toward center Deandre Ayton about tipping rebounds. Ayton, who finished with 10 rebounds and 12 points, and Smart ended the timeout with a high-five.\n\n“[I need to] just continue to talk to guys, even though sometimes they might not want to hear it,” said Smart, a free-agent addition the Lakers coveted for his leadership and tenacity on defense. “Especially when we losing, nobody wants to hear it, myself included, but also understand that it's integral for us to hear those things, to see and to be able to talk to one another and figure it out as players on the court, because we're the ones out there.”\n\nRedick intentionally built in moments for players to connect and communicate during every timeout this season before coaches speak. The strategy was meant to encourage players to take a larger leadership role. “Championship communication” was one of the team’s three pillars.\n\nAlong with “championship shape,” Redick also asked his team to build “championship habits.” Living up to the mantras is easier said than done.\n\n“It's not the easy choice,” Redick said. “It's human nature. … We do it on a daily basis. We make easy choices cause it's comfortable. Comfortable doesn't win.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

There are a total of five NBA games on the holiday this year, with one of the games being an intriguing matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets.\n\nBoth the Lakers and Rockets are jockeying for playoff positioning in the competitive Western Conference. The Lakers are currently fourth in the conference standings at 19-9 while the Rockets are two spots behind them at 17-10.\n\nThe Christmas Day stage provides a platform for stars to shine, and luckily the Lakers will have one of the league’s biggest stars available for the game.\n\nAfter missing L.A.’s last game with a left calf contusion, Luka Doncic is expected to play against Houston, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania.\n\nThis is obviously good news for the Lakers and basketball fans alike, as Doncic is one of the most exiting – and productive – players in the league. On the season he’s averaging a league-leading 34.1 points per game to go along with 8.8 rebounds and 8.6 assists.\n\nMore Lakers news: LeBron James gets brutally honest about having to play on Christmas Day\n\nThere will be no shortage of star power in the game between L.A. and Houston. In addition to Doncic, LeBron James will be available for the Lakers, and he’ll face off against a familiar foe in Kevin Durant.\n\nThat duo will combine to make some NBA history when they take the floor on Christmas. The pair has scored a total of 73,630 points in the league, which represents the most combined points in a head-to-head matchup ever.\n\nThe holiday matchup between L.A. and Houston will be the first of three meetings between the two teams on the season.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers have been dealing with injuries to key players lately. Austin Reaves, Deandre Ayton, Rui Hachimura and Luka Doncic have all suffered ailments over the last week or two, and it is one reason the team has won just four of its last eight games.\n\nWhen Los Angeles takes on the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday to wrap up a four-game road trip, it will still be without Doncic and Hachimura. Ayton will return to action after missing two games due to elbow soreness.\n\nReaves was originally listed as questionable for Tuesday's game.

    "fullText": "Over the last few days, the Los Angeles Lakers have suddenly become very short-handed. First, they lost Austin Reaves to a calf strain he suffered just over a week ago, and then starting center Deandre Ayton came down with elbow soreness and missed their last two games.\n\nThen, against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, they didn't have starting forward Rui Hachimura, who is dealing with a groin ailment. To make matters worse, Luka Doncic sustained a leg contusion during that game and was ruled out for the second half. Without so many key players, the Lakers had a huge lack of offensive firepower and lost 103-88 to the Clippers.\n\nHead coach JJ Redick said that he hopes Hachimura will be back after missing a total of only a few days.\n\nJJ Redick says Rui Hachimura, out tonight with a sore groin, started to feel discomfort in his hip in the UTA game. Redick says “the hope” is Hachimura is only out for 3-5 days\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 21, 2025\n\nHe also added that Ayton and Reaves are improving, although he didn't say whether either of them will play in the team's next game on Tuesday versus the Phoenix Suns.\n\nRedick added that Deandre Ayton (left elbow) and Austin Reaves (left calf) are both progressing and did not rule out either of them playing in PHX on Tuesday https://t.co/GeFicCsrlL\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Lakers have a marquee matchup coming up on Christmas Day versus Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets, who are 17-8 and right behind the Lakers in fifth place in the Western Conference. Five days later, the Purple and Gold will host the Detroit Pistons, who have the Eastern Conference's best record at 22-6.\n\nNeedless to say, they will need to be somewhere close to full strength in order to defeat either team, let alone both of them.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: JJ Redick gives updates on Rui Hachimura, Austin Reaves, Deandre Ayton",

    "fullText": "Jake LaRavia opens up about his shooting struggles originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have struggled from three-point range this season, shooting 34.3%, 25th in the NBA.\n\nIn a 15-point loss last night against the Clippers, the Lakers shot an abysmal 16% from three (6-for-38). With Rui Hachimura and Deandre Ayton sidelined, Jake LaRavia entered the starting lineup.\n\nAlthough the fourth-year forward posted a double-double with 12 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, he continues to struggle from beyond the arc.\n\nLaRavia shot 0-for-4 from deep in what has been an inefficient shooting season. His 30.5% from deep is a career-low, after averaging a career-high 42.3% from beyond the arc last season.\n\nFollowing the game, LaRavia spoke on his shooting struggles, expecting to get back on track soon.  “I know I’m a good shooter, everyone on the staff knows I’m a good shooter, everyone on the team knows I’m a good shooter,” LaRavia said. “At some point, I have to make shots. Obviously, been in a slump pretty much this entire season outside of that first stretch of games where I was making some. But they’ll drop.”\n\nFor Los Angeles, they'll need LaRavia to step up, especially if Luka Doncic is sidelined for an extended period. Even when Los Angeles is fully healthy, 34.3% from deep isn't a recipe for success in the modern NBA.\n\nIn addition to LaRavia, role players like Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent and Dalton Knecht will be relied upon to knock down threes in support of Doncic, LeBron James and Austin Reaves.\n\nThe Lakers will return to action Tuesday against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nFormer NBA Champion reveals he nearly signed with the Lakers\n\nDylan Harper shares his thoughts after crushing NBA Cup defeat\n\nKnicks' Karl-Anthony Towns makes classy gesture after NBA Cup victory\n\nPat Riley nearly paired Dwayne Wade with Allen Iverson\n\nDanny Wolf's stock continues to rise\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is lighting it up in the month of December",

    "fullText": "Luka Doncic left the Lakers' loss to the Clippers Saturday at halftime and did not return with what the team is calling a left leg contusion.\n\nDoncic left the building without talking to reporters, and coach J.J. Redick's postgame comments didn't shed much light on the situation (quote via Dave McMenamin of ESPN).\n\n\"I saw him hobbling towards the end of the first half. He came to me at halftime and said he couldn't go… I don't have any other information.\"\n\nThe injury clearly bothered him for much of the game. Doncic, the NBA's leading scorer at 35.2 points per game, scored just 12 points on the night shooting 4-of-13 (1-of-6 from 3-point range).\n\nDoncic wasn't the only significant injury in this game. Clippers center Ivica Zubac went to the ground in the first quarter and instantly limped back to the locker room with what was described as an ankle injury. He did not return to the game and the Clippers said he would be re-evaluated on Sunday. Zubac has been one of the few consistent bright spots in the Clippers' season, averaging 15.6 points and 11.1 rebounds per game.\n\nThe Clippers picked up their first home win since Halloween with the 103-88 victory over the Lakers. Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers with 32 points and 12 rebounds, while James Harden pitched in with 21 points and 10 assists.\n\nLeBron James led the Lakers with 36 points, but every other Laker combined to shoot 31.7% on the night, including 3-of-30 from beyond the arc.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrade talks surrounding the Los Angeles Lakers are heating up, and the Lakers appear to be in pursuit of a veteran forward.\n\nAccording to Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, the Lakers are pursuing New Orleans Pelicans wing Herb Jones.\n\n“The Los Angeles Lakers are monitoring the trade market for a defensive wing upgrade, league sources told HoopsHype. Among the 3-and-D wing upgrades on their wish list is New Orleans Pelicans forward Herb Jones, league sources say.”\n\nJones is widely considered one of the NBA’s top defenders. He’s averaged 1.6 steals and 0.7 blocks during his five NBA seasons. He would give the Lakers an aggressive defender who can match up with guards at the point of attack.\n\nJones has been a key member of the Pelicans’ rotation since his rookie year in 2021. He’s averaging 10.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and shooting 40.3% from the field this season. He’s also been a reliable 3-point shooter, shooting 33.7% this season and 36.2% for his career.\n\nHe only played 20 games last season due to a posterior labrum tear in his right shoulder. He’s already matched that total this season but missed around a week in November with a calf strain.\n\nJones is set to make $13.9 million this season and signed a three-year, $67.58M extension with the Pelicans last summer. The Lakers have limited future draft picks and cap space. Their 2031 unprotected first round pick could be enticing to the Pelicans, who could look to retool their roster around their rookies.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhenever star players become available in the NBA, or even when they’re simply involved in rumors, the Los Angeles Lakers are typically linked to them.\n\nWhether it’s to drive up the price or because the Lakers have a genuine interest, we see it happen all the time.\n\nIt’s a bit crazy how often the Lakers are connected to these names, but nobody would have expected the team to trade for Luka Doncic a year ago.\n\nPerhaps Lakers fans have a point when they believe the franchise will eventually land another star.\n\nThe latest name to surface is Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. While the Bucks may not be looking to move on from Antetokounmpo, Michael Scotto of HoopsHype reported that teams like the Lakers continue to monitor the situation, even if nothing is pressing at the moment.\n\n“In fact, rival executives interested in trading for Antetokounmpo who’ve spoken with HoopsHype said they don’t believe Milwaukee wants to move him right now. With that said, it’s unlikely to keep teams such as the New York Knicks, Miami Heat, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Houston Rockets, and others from continuing to monitor Antetokounmpo’s situation to varying degrees, looking ahead,” he wrote.\n\nLanding Antetokounmpo would give the Lakers one of the best duos in the NBA for a long time, assuming he and Doncic can stay on the court when it matters most.\n\nAntetokounmpo has dealt with his fair share of injuries, but he would still be worth whatever the Lakers would have to give up.\n\nLakers' LeBron James turns back the clock with vicious dunk\n\nLakers face Luka Doncic-LeBron James crossroads after JJ Redick's latest on-court experiment\n\nLuka Doncic makes basketball history never done by Lakers point guard\n\nLakers' Luka Doncic broke all-time Anthony Davis record",
