Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLeBron James took, and missed, two technical foul shots on Sunday for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHis head coach, JJ Redick, was confused afterward about why LeBron took the second one (which came after Dillon Brooks chest-bumped the King).\n\n\"Luka should have taken that,\" Redick told reporters after the game.\n\nAs you probably know, any player on the floor at the time of the technical foul can take the ensuing free throw.\n\nIt really doesn't make sense for LeBron to be taking any of those over Doncic.\n\nIn his career, James is a 73% foul shooter. Doncic is at 75%.\n\nThis season, it's more glaring. LeBron has made just 61.9% of his free throws. Doncic is at 81.1%.\n\nThe numbers all align on the same side: Doncic should take the techs, not James.\n\nSure, there's likely an urge to be the guy to take the foul shot yourself if you're the one who essentially draws the technical foul.\n\nBut in a close game, it makes more sense to have the guy who is more likely to make the foul shot take the foul shot.\n\nFor the Lakers, that's Luka and not LeBron.\n\nGoing forward, it's safe to expect L.A. to get this right. Points are too valuable to be lowering the odds.\n\nMORE: 'Blocked by James' call makes unexpected return during Lakers game",

In 1944, he was named the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA Tournament as the Utes won the national championship, and three years later, he helped the school win a National Invitation Tournament title.\n\nThe Lakers took Ferrin in the third round of the 1948 draft, and he spent three seasons in the NBA, with all of them coming as a member of the Lakers. He averaged 5.8 points and 1.6 assists a game during that time and won championships during both of his first two seasons in the league.\n\nAfter his NBA career ended, Ferrin had a short stint as the general manager of the American Basketball Association's Utah Stars in the 1970s, and afterward, he was the athletic director for the Utes from 1976 to 1985.

Luckily, they’ll have their future Hall-of-Famer available for the game.\n\nLeBron James, who has been dealing with various ailments throughout the season, isn’t listed on the official injury report for the contest, so he should be good to go. On the season, James is averaging 16.5 points, 7.6 assists and 6.0 rebounds per performance in just eight appearances.\n\nBut, while James will be available for L.A. against Phoenix, a few other players won’t be. Austin Reaves, Maxi Kleber and Bronny James have all been ruled out of the game. Reaves, who has been a huge factor in L.A.'s early-season success, is expected to miss a week of action with a calf strain.\n\nMeanwhile, the Suns will be without Jalen Green and Isaiah Livers. Star guard Devin Booker is also listed as questionable for the contest.\n\nHeading into the game, the Lakers are fifth in the Western Conference standings with a 17-7 record while the Suns sit seventh at 14-11. Since they're in the same division, the two teams will play two more times this season after Sunday, including once later this month. They'll also play in late February.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt’s safe to say the Los Angeles Lakers will look a bit different by the time the Feb. 5 trade deadline passes.\n\nThe franchise has plenty of tradable assets it can use in a midseason deal to upgrade its roster. Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk is under the impression that Luka Doncic’s 6-foot-10 former Dallas Mavericks teammate is among the assets the Lakers will move on from this season.\n\n“The Golden State Warriors proved last season why it can be advantageous to make a move early,” Rovenchuk wrote Friday. “They acquired Dennis Schroder, gave the experiment a shot, and rerouted him in favor of eventually securing Jimmy Butler when the initial venture failed.”\n\n“If the Lakers were going to replicate a similar approach, there is one clear member of the roster who stands out as a part of the outgoing package for Los Angeles. That would be Maxi Kleber.”\n\n“Kleber has been sidelined recently, dealing with a lower back injury. With the Lakers struggling to find defense, athleticism, shooting, and bench scoring, any one of these needs could have him moved before even being given the opportunity to return to the court for Los Angeles.”\n\nWhile it may not be easy to believe, Kleber was once a valuable stretch four who played respectable pick-and-pop basketball alongside Doncic in Los Angeles.\n\nFast forward to the 2025-26 season, and Kleber, who was included in the blockbuster Feb. 2 trade that landed Doncic with the Lakers, is a low-impact contributor for JJ Redick’s crew.\n\nWhile Kleber is shooting 37.5% from three, he’s contributing just 1.8 points and 1.8 rebounds per game in 12.1 minutes, signaling that it may be time to part ways with the 33-year-old big man.\n\nIf one thing’s certain, Kleber is running out of time to prove himself in Los Angeles.\n\nMore NBA: Spurs' Stephon Castle makes basketball history never done ever before in NBA",

For the time being, the feedback is mixed on that front. ’Tis the season for smokescreens, after all.\"\n\nMORE: This Warriors news leak about a Draymond-Giannis trade is hilarious\n\nMurphy could be a part of the Pelicans' core alongside Derik Queen, if they want to go that route. It remains to be seen what they'll do with him.\n\nJones would cost a bit less in a trade, at least in concept.\n\n\"Our Lakers’ beat writer, Dan Woike, highlighted their interest in Jones this week,\" Amick writes. \"At the same time, he cited team and league sources who said the Pelicans are 'not interested' in moving Jones. Fair enough, but let’s circle back for a vibe check in late January.\"\n\nNew Orleans is already struggling. If the struggles only get worse, the Pelicans will have little choice but to consider trades to try to prop up their future, since their present doesn't appear to be going anywhere.\n\nThe Warriors and Lakers will be circling for that moment of opportunity to come.\n\nRich Paul makes the LeBron James trade plans clear\n\nWhy it's time for the Pelicans to move on from Zion\n\nThe Bucks have a looming $275 million Giannis problem\n\nTimberwolves want Coby White, but there's a catch",

He had gone undrafted in 2010 out of Harvard University, not exactly a high-level basketball school, and was a seemingly invisible rookie with the Golden State Warriors, but he seemingly shot himself out of a cannon with New York.\n\nIt sparked a phenomenon people referred to as \"Linsanity,\" and even after the rest of the league adjusted to him and his production regressed to a more consistent mean, a sizable amount of the hype surrounding him remained.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the rebuilding Lakers acquired Lin in a trade with the Houston Rockets. By now, he was straddling the line between a low-tier starting point guard and a very solid reserve point guard. He played one season with the Lakers and started in 30 of 74 games while averaging 11.2 points and 4.6 assists in 25.8 minutes a game.\n\nHe left L.A. following that season and would have short stints with the Charlotte Hornets, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors before his NBA career ended.

    "fullText": "The San Antonio Spurs are headed to the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, 132-119, on Wednesday, and might have Victor Wembanyama back in the lineup for the big tournament matchup. Following the team’s quarterfinal victory over the Lakers on Wednesday, Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson to reporters that Wemby might be ready to make his return from injury over the weekend.\n\n“Very much so,” coach Johnson said. “He had a really good day today. He had a very intense day this morning, and we’ll have to see how he responds or reacts (Thursday).”\n\nWemby went through an intense workout on Wednesday morning and then worked out again during pregame warmups before the Lakers game. He was able to get through that workout without any extra protection on his strained calf, according to Johnson.\n\nWembanyama has been sidelined with his calf strain and hasn’t played since Nov. 16. However, the Spurs have been able to get through this stretch and post a 9-3 record without their All-Star big man and defensive anchor. Wemby’s potential return couldn’t come at a better time as the Spurs will face the defending NBA Champion Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nIn Wembanyama's absence, other players like last season's Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle have had to step up even more to help carry the load. In Wednesday's win over the Lakers, Castle scored 30 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and dished 6 assists. De'Aaron Fox chipped in with 20 points, and Keldon Johnson scored 17 off the bench.\n\n“I think Victor would tell you we have a deep team, and we rely upon playing together as a team,” Johnson said. “He may be the biggest puzzle piece, but he needs everybody else to complete the puzzle.”\n\nAlthough Wemby has missed half of San Antonio’s 24 games this season, the Spurs are 17-7 overall and currently fifth in the Western Conference. When Wembanyama is on the court, he’s been as dominant as ever this season, averaging career-highs of 26.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, along with 3.6 blocks.\n\nSan Antonio and OKC square off in the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday, Dec. 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The NBA Cup championship game will be played on Dec. 16 in Las Vegas.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLeBron James may not be as good as he once was, but he's as good once as he ever was.\n\nThose Toby Keith lyrics, repurposed for this moment, certainly fit what the Los Angeles Lakers' 40-year-old superstar did on Wednesday night.\n\nWith an open trip down the lane, James gathered speed like the freight train of old.\n\nHe didn't appear bothered one bit by the presence of the gigantic Luke Kornet waiting at the rim for the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nJames, who turns 41 in three weeks, rose up and thundered down a poster dunk, no questions asked.\n\n40-YEAR OLD LEBRON POSTER ON 7'1 LUKE KORNET 🤯🔥\n\nUNREAL. pic.twitter.com/ekPdfMwjsR\n\n— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) December 11, 2025\n\nMaybe his streak of double-digit points is over.\n\nMaybe he's not the first option on his team anymore.\n\nBut this is still LeBron James. And he's still got it.\n\nWhat other 40-year-old in the history of the planet is doing that? None. Zero. Zilch. Nada.\n\nThat's King behavior right there.\n\nIt was the NBA Cup quarterfinals, and James wasn't holding back. The Lakers went to halftime with a deficit, but they also went to the half with this highlight.\n\nAnd even in a career full of moments like this, watching LeBron do that at this stage is still remarkable.\n\n3 Eastern Conference teams chasing after Anthony Davis trade\n\nPelicans' Derik Queen puts up crazy numbers only done in recent NBA history by LeBron James, Nikola Jokic\n\nRich Paul makes the LeBron James trade plans clear\n\nDesmond Bane offers $35,000 explanation for NBA Cup outburst",

    "fullText": "Any chance the Lakers had at trying to capture a second NBA Cup championship in the third season of the tournament evaporated for good in the fourth quarter against a young, fast and athletic San Antonio Spurs team missing its best player.\n\nThe Lakers won the inaugural NBA Cup title in 2023 and had designs on winning it again in 2025 and the $500,000 cash that goes to each player on the championship team.\n\nBut it was not to be — not with the Lakers unable to slow down the Spurs during a 132-119 quarterfinal loss Wednesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers got down by as much as 24 points in the fourth and made a run to get to within eight points late in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Lakers got no closer and now will face the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday.\n\nThe Spurs will meet the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in Las Vegas in the semifinals.\n\nLuka Doncic had 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists, Marcus Smart came off the bench to score 26 and LeBron James had 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. But that wasn’t enough against a Spurs team that had seven players score in double figures.\n\nStephon Castle led the Spurs with 30 points and De’Aaron Fox had 20.\n\nWhen the Lakers needed someone to lift them when they got down by 18 points in the second, someone to provide them a spark when there wasn’t one for so much of the quarter, they finally got it from the oldest player on the court, 40-year-old LeBron James.\n\nJames drove down the lane and threw down a thunderous dunk over Spurs 7-1 center Luke Kornet, bringing the Lakers to within eight points and charging up the crowd in the process.\n\nJames growled and yelled in the face of the reeling Kornet. The crowd stood and cheered, now happy that there was a Lakers’ awakening.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t hold on to that momentum, falling behind 70-58 at the half.\n\nAnd then when the third quarter started, the Lakers came out flat, giving up back-to-back threes and two more easy baskets for the Spurs to fall into an 80-60 hole early in the third.\n\nThe Lakers didn’t make it easy on themselves either.\n\nDoncic got a technical foul in the first quarter after no foul was called after Kelly Olynyk smacked him in the face and Lakers coach JJ Redick was called for a technical foul in the second quarter.\n\nWhen the Lakers last faced the Spurs a little over a month ago here, San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama played in a game L.A. won, but speedy point guard De’Aaron Fox did not.\n\nIt was the opposite this time, with Fox playing and Wembanyama out with a left calf strain.\n\nThe 7-5 Wembanyama has been out for almost a month and the super-quick Fox has been back during that time, which has changed the dynamic of the Spurs, which meant the Lakers had to shift how they played defense against San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs are more guard-oriented with Fox, Castle and Dylan Harper.\n\nThe Lakers got a taste of how much faster the Spurs are now in the first quarter, when L.A. gave up 39 points and trailed by nine after the first frame.\n\nThe Spurs show 56% from the field in the first, 50% (six-for-12) from three-point range.\n\nKeldon Johnson came off the bench to score 13 points in the first quarter for the Spurs.\n\n\"Yeah, they're running a lot of pick and rolls with Fox, a lot of pick and rolls with Castle and Harper,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said pregame about the Spurs’ new way of playing. “And all those pick and rolls lead to drives, those pick and rolls lead to kick-outs and catch two threes and then more drives. So, we've got to do a good job of containing the basketball and do a good job of contesting.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",
