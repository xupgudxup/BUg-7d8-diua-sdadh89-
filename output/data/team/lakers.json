    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers have been dealing with injuries to key players lately. Austin Reaves, Deandre Ayton, Rui Hachimura and Luka Doncic have all suffered ailments over the last week or two, and it is one reason the team has won just four of its last eight games.\n\nWhen Los Angeles takes on the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday to wrap up a four-game road trip, it will still be without Doncic and Hachimura. Ayton will return to action after missing two games due to elbow soreness.\n\nReaves was originally listed as questionable for Tuesday's game. But he will play versus Phoenix, which will give L.A. a big boost.\n\nAustin Reaves has been upgraded to available for tonight against PHX, the Lakers announced. He will return after a three game absence because of a mild left calf strain.\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 23, 2025\n\nReaves is averaging 27.8 points and 6.7 assists a game while shooting 50.3% from the field and 36.9% from 3-point range so far this season. In 21 games, he has hit the 40-point mark three times already, and he had a new career high of 51 points on Oct. 26 versus the Sacramento Kings.\n\nHe has a history of putting up big scoring numbers whenever either Doncic or LeBron James has been out, and that is exactly what it will likely take for the Lakers to defeat a potent and feisty Suns squad.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers give huge update on Austin Reaves before Tuesday's game vs Suns",

First, they lost Austin Reaves to a calf strain he suffered just over a week ago, and then starting center Deandre Ayton came down with elbow soreness and missed their last two games.\n\nThen, against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, they didn't have starting forward Rui Hachimura, who is dealing with a groin ailment. To make matters worse, Luka Doncic sustained a leg contusion during that game and was ruled out for the second half. Without so many key players, the Lakers had a huge lack of offensive firepower and lost 103-88 to the Clippers.\n\nHead coach JJ Redick said that he hopes Hachimura will be back after missing a total of only a few days.\n\nJJ Redick says Rui Hachimura, out tonight with a sore groin, started to feel discomfort in his hip in the UTA game. Redick says “the hope” is Hachimura is only out for 3-5 days\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 21, 2025\n\nHe also added that Ayton and Reaves are improving, although he didn't say whether either of them will play in the team's next game on Tuesday versus the Phoenix Suns.\n\nRedick added that Deandre Ayton (left elbow) and Austin Reaves (left calf) are both progressing and did not rule out either of them playing in PHX on Tuesday https://t.co/GeFicCsrlL\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Lakers have a marquee matchup coming up on Christmas Day versus Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets, who are 17-8 and right behind the Lakers in fifth place in the Western Conference.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have struggled from three-point range this season, shooting 34.3%, 25th in the NBA.\n\nIn a 15-point loss last night against the Clippers, the Lakers shot an abysmal 16% from three (6-for-38). With Rui Hachimura and Deandre Ayton sidelined, Jake LaRavia entered the starting lineup.\n\nAlthough the fourth-year forward posted a double-double with 12 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, he continues to struggle from beyond the arc.\n\nLaRavia shot 0-for-4 from deep in what has been an inefficient shooting season. His 30.5% from deep is a career-low, after averaging a career-high 42.3% from beyond the arc last season.\n\nFollowing the game, LaRavia spoke on his shooting struggles, expecting to get back on track soon.  “I know I’m a good shooter, everyone on the staff knows I’m a good shooter, everyone on the team knows I’m a good shooter,” LaRavia said. “At some point, I have to make shots. Obviously, been in a slump pretty much this entire season outside of that first stretch of games where I was making some. But they’ll drop.”\n\nFor Los Angeles, they'll need LaRavia to step up, especially if Luka Doncic is sidelined for an extended period. Even when Los Angeles is fully healthy, 34.3% from deep isn't a recipe for success in the modern NBA.\n\nIn addition to LaRavia, role players like Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent and Dalton Knecht will be relied upon to knock down threes in support of Doncic, LeBron James and Austin Reaves.\n\nThe Lakers will return to action Tuesday against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nFormer NBA Champion reveals he nearly signed with the Lakers\n\nDylan Harper shares his thoughts after crushing NBA Cup defeat\n\nKnicks' Karl-Anthony Towns makes classy gesture after NBA Cup victory\n\nPat Riley nearly paired Dwayne Wade with Allen Iverson\n\nDanny Wolf's stock continues to rise\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is lighting it up in the month of December",

Redick's postgame comments didn't shed much light on the situation (quote via Dave McMenamin of ESPN).\n\n\"I saw him hobbling towards the end of the first half. He came to me at halftime and said he couldn't go… I don't have any other information.\"\n\nThe injury clearly bothered him for much of the game. Doncic, the NBA's leading scorer at 35.2 points per game, scored just 12 points on the night shooting 4-of-13 (1-of-6 from 3-point range).\n\nDoncic wasn't the only significant injury in this game. Clippers center Ivica Zubac went to the ground in the first quarter and instantly limped back to the locker room with what was described as an ankle injury. He did not return to the game and the Clippers said he would be re-evaluated on Sunday. Zubac has been one of the few consistent bright spots in the Clippers' season, averaging 15.6 points and 11.1 rebounds per game.\n\nThe Clippers picked up their first home win since Halloween with the 103-88 victory over the Lakers. Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers with 32 points and 12 rebounds, while James Harden pitched in with 21 points and 10 assists.\n\nLeBron James led the Lakers with 36 points, but every other Laker combined to shoot 31.7% on the night, including 3-of-30 from beyond the arc.",

He’s averaged 1.6 steals and 0.7 blocks during his five NBA seasons. He would give the Lakers an aggressive defender who can match up with guards at the point of attack.\n\nJones has been a key member of the Pelicans’ rotation since his rookie year in 2021. He’s averaging 10.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and shooting 40.3% from the field this season. He’s also been a reliable 3-point shooter, shooting 33.7% this season and 36.2% for his career.\n\nHe only played 20 games last season due to a posterior labrum tear in his right shoulder. He’s already matched that total this season but missed around a week in November with a calf strain.\n\nJones is set to make $13.9 million this season and signed a three-year, $67.58M extension with the Pelicans last summer. The Lakers have limited future draft picks and cap space. Their 2031 unprotected first round pick could be enticing to the Pelicans, who could look to retool their roster around their rookies.",

    "fullText": "Lakers face Luka Doncic-LeBron James crossroads after JJ Redick's latest on-court experiment originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers pulled off one of the most groundbreaking trades just before the deadline last February. Acquiring Luka Dončić was one of the most shocking deals in NBA history. While the Lakers want to build around him—and understand that it may take time—Dončić still wants to win now.\n\n“Dončić being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn't mean they can slow down and take their time. Dončić told Lakers president Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick in May that he's not interested in taking the slow approach in building a contender,” CBS Sports’ Jasmyn Wimbish wrote.\n\nLos Angeles got off to a hot start, but lately the team has become stagnant. Defense has been a major reason for that struggle. As a result, head coach JJ Redick reportedly called a meeting with Dončić and LeBron James, challenging them to step up on that end of the floor.\n\n“It was good. We talked about a lot - not just that. But he was right. You got to get a little bit more, especially from the star players. So that’s on us, that’s on me.” - Luka Dončić on JJ Redick’s recent meeting where he asked for more on the defensive end from him and LeBron,” Lakers insider Dave McMenamin posted.\n\nIt also appears that Redick is working to get Dončić more involved off the ball.\n\n“JJ just inferred that he's been trying to get Luka to play more off-ball, but he's been reluctant and uncomfortable. However he made some progress in that regard today. If Luka learns how to play off-ball, even a 10% increase would make the Lakers so much more dangerous,” Lakers Daily posted.\n\nWhile getting Dončić involved off the ball could benefit the offense, it may also signal that Redick is still searching for the best way to keep all of his stars engaged. LeBron James has yet to have a truly dominant game, and that could be due in part to not having the ball in his hands as often.\n\nRedick now appears to be at a crossroads as he works to maximize his roster. This is his current solution, but if Dončić is unwilling to fully embrace the change, the offense could suffer. If these issues aren’t addressed soon, they could quickly become a significant problem.",

The Jazz are fifth in rebounds (45.7), eighth in offensive rebounds (12.6), and 12th in field-goal percentage.\n\n\"The way we play, we got to approach every game the same,\" Doncic said. \"In the NBA, every team is dangerous, so at some point somebody can go for 40. They have Markkanen, and then George. They can go for 40 on any night. So we just got to work on ourselves and approach the game, make everything the same.\"\n\nThe all-out energy and effort by Vanderbilt off the bench was the catalyst for the Lakers against the Suns.\n\nIn his 15 minutes of action, he had seven ponits, seven rebounds, two steals and one blocked shot.\n\nVanderbilt had played only three minutes and eight seconds over a 10-game stretch prior to that point.\n\n“Vando's minutes were huge,” Gabe Vincent said. “He came in and does what we all know he's very capable of doing and being disruptive on the defensive end, crashing the glass, getting extra possessions for us, all of which we desperately needed. You know what I mean? So his spark off the bench was huge for us.\"\n\nNow it’s about sustaining that defensive intensity, the Lakers say. And about playing with that physicality, the Lakers say.\n\n“Yeah, when you guys asked me this the last time, it’s effort,” Jake LaRavia said. “If we just go out there and we give that kind of effort every night…We got a lot of guys on the team. Some guys might not be having it and, like you said about that contagious word, that really helps out. (Marcus) Smart does it sometimes. Vando does it sometimes. I would say I do it just being a contagious type of person to help lead the team and just being extra physical.”\n\nThe Lakers are ranked near the bottom of the league in some defensive categories, which means there remains room for improvement.\n\nThey are ranked 17th in the league in points allowed (116.7), 24th in field-goal percentage (48.1%) allowed and 28th in three-point shooting (38.1%) allowed.\n\n“You just got to go out there and do it,” LaRavia said. “It’s not anything a coach can say. It’s not anything a player can tell another player. Yeah, it’s like the individual player’s job to go out there and give effort on defense and that’s contagious. It just goes around.”\n\nLakers center Deandre Ayton on Wednesday was named by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Assn. as the winner of the Bob Lanier Community Assist Award for November. Ayton was recognized for his philanthropic work across the Bahamas, which is his home country, Jamaica and Los Angeles through the Ayton Family Foundation.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Former NBA star Paul Pierce didn't hold back when he described the Lakers' poor decision-making in the final minutes of Sunday's win over the Suns.",
    "fullText": "Late in the third quarter of their Sunday matchup against the Phoenix Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers started to play the type of winning defense that their fans have been practically begging for. During a stretch of roughly 10 minutes that extended into the fourth quarter, they scored 24 unanswered points and forced seven turnovers, allowing them to take a 95-77 lead.\n\nHowever, after that outstanding spurt, the Lakers fell back into their old bad habits on both ends of the floor. They started to walk the ball upcourt and milk the shot clock, as if they were merely looking to conservatively protect their lead rather than build on it and hold off Phoenix. That behavior played right into Phoenix's hands, and they ended up having to pull out a 116-114 victory by the skin of their teeth after the Suns made a couple of big mistakes in the final seconds.\n\nIt was another reminder that the Lakers still have a lot of work to do in order to seriously contend for the NBA championship.\n\nHall of Famer Paul Pierce went off on them during a recent episode of the \"No Fouls Given\" podcast for the way they gave up their lead in the last several minutes of Sunday's game. He said the Lakers — and the Suns — had very poor basketball IQ in the final minutes of that contest, and that neither team will be able to win a playoff series this spring as a result.\n\n\"This was one of the lowest IQ, last four minutes I've seen from both teams this season. And based on what I saw, neither one of these teams can win a playoff series.\"\n\nOf course, the Lakers are likely not as reckless and undisciplined as they looked in the final minutes of Sunday's game, nor are they as good a defensive team as they looked during that 10-minute stretch late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter. They do have an 18-7 record, which gives them an elite winning percentage, and are in third place in the Western Conference.\n\nBut Los Angeles hasn't played the Denver Nuggets, Houston Rockets or New York Knicks yet, and when it faced the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder a month ago, it lost 121-92, albeit with LeBron James still out due to sciatica. Continuing to put forth the same ineptitude they displayed late in Sunday's game will almost certainly result in decisive losses against the Nuggets, Rockets, Knicks and especially the Thunder.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Paul Pierce on Lakers' basketball IQ in crunch time of Sunday's game",

Doncic is at 75%.\n\nThis season, it's more glaring. LeBron has made just 61.9% of his free throws. Doncic is at 81.1%.\n\nThe numbers all align on the same side: Doncic should take the techs, not James.\n\nSure, there's likely an urge to be the guy to take the foul shot yourself if you're the one who essentially draws the technical foul.\n\nBut in a close game, it makes more sense to have the guy who is more likely to make the foul shot take the foul shot.\n\nFor the Lakers, that's Luka and not LeBron.\n\nGoing forward, it's safe to expect L.A. to get this right.

Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nChariton Arnold Ferrin Jr. was a basketball star in college while at the University of Utah. In 1944, he was named the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA Tournament as the Utes won the national championship, and three years later, he helped the school win a National Invitation Tournament title.\n\nThe Lakers took Ferrin in the third round of the 1948 draft, and he spent three seasons in the NBA, with all of them coming as a member of the Lakers. He averaged 5.8 points and 1.6 assists a game during that time and won championships during both of his first two seasons in the league.\n\nAfter his NBA career ended, Ferrin had a short stint as the general manager of the American Basketball Association's Utah Stars in the 1970s, and afterward, he was the athletic director for the Utes from 1976 to 1985. During his time as athletic director, the Utes won a total of 10 national championships, including four NCAA titles in women's gymnastics.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 18 — Chariton Arnold Ferrin Jr.",

Austin Reaves, Maxi Kleber and Bronny James have all been ruled out of the game. Reaves, who has been a huge factor in L.A.'s early-season success, is expected to miss a week of action with a calf strain.\n\nMeanwhile, the Suns will be without Jalen Green and Isaiah Livers. Star guard Devin Booker is also listed as questionable for the contest.\n\nHeading into the game, the Lakers are fifth in the Western Conference standings with a 17-7 record while the Suns sit seventh at 14-11.

    "fullText": "Lakers predicted to cut ties with Luka Doncic's former $33 million Mavericks teammate originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt’s safe to say the Los Angeles Lakers will look a bit different by the time the Feb. 5 trade deadline passes.\n\nThe franchise has plenty of tradable assets it can use in a midseason deal to upgrade its roster. Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk is under the impression that Luka Doncic’s 6-foot-10 former Dallas Mavericks teammate is among the assets the Lakers will move on from this season.\n\n“The Golden State Warriors proved last season why it can be advantageous to make a move early,” Rovenchuk wrote Friday. “They acquired Dennis Schroder, gave the experiment a shot, and rerouted him in favor of eventually securing Jimmy Butler when the initial venture failed.”\n\n“If the Lakers were going to replicate a similar approach, there is one clear member of the roster who stands out as a part of the outgoing package for Los Angeles. That would be Maxi Kleber.”\n\n“Kleber has been sidelined recently, dealing with a lower back injury. With the Lakers struggling to find defense, athleticism, shooting, and bench scoring, any one of these needs could have him moved before even being given the opportunity to return to the court for Los Angeles.”\n\nWhile it may not be easy to believe, Kleber was once a valuable stretch four who played respectable pick-and-pop basketball alongside Doncic in Los Angeles.\n\nFast forward to the 2025-26 season, and Kleber, who was included in the blockbuster Feb. 2 trade that landed Doncic with the Lakers, is a low-impact contributor for JJ Redick’s crew.\n\nWhile Kleber is shooting 37.5% from three, he’s contributing just 1.8 points and 1.8 rebounds per game in 12.1 minutes, signaling that it may be time to part ways with the 33-year-old big man.\n\nIf one thing’s certain, Kleber is running out of time to prove himself in Los Angeles.\n\nMore NBA: Spurs' Stephon Castle makes basketball history never done ever before in NBA",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans are having one of the worst seasons in the NBA.\n\nThey could also be crucial to how the rest of the year plays out in the Western Conference.\n\nThat's because the Pels have two trade chips that are sought after by a lot of the league: Trey Murphy III and Herbert Jones.\n\nThe latest reporting from The Athletic's Sam Amick indicates that the Golden State Warriors are especially intrigued by Murphy, and that the Los Angeles Lakers really want Jones.\n\n\"For quite some time now, the Warriors have been open about their desire to acquire the Pelicans’ Trey Murphy III,\" Amick writes. \"But if they’re going to use Kuminga to do that, then it would be helpful to know how, if at all, the Pelicans value the Warriors’ 23-year-old forward. For the time being, the feedback is mixed on that front. ’Tis the season for smokescreens, after all.\"\n\nMORE: This Warriors news leak about a Draymond-Giannis trade is hilarious\n\nMurphy could be a part of the Pelicans' core alongside Derik Queen, if they want to go that route. It remains to be seen what they'll do with him.\n\nJones would cost a bit less in a trade, at least in concept.\n\n\"Our Lakers’ beat writer, Dan Woike, highlighted their interest in Jones this week,\" Amick writes. \"At the same time, he cited team and league sources who said the Pelicans are 'not interested' in moving Jones. Fair enough, but let’s circle back for a vibe check in late January.\"\n\nNew Orleans is already struggling. If the struggles only get worse, the Pelicans will have little choice but to consider trades to try to prop up their future, since their present doesn't appear to be going anywhere.\n\nThe Warriors and Lakers will be circling for that moment of opportunity to come.\n\nRich Paul makes the LeBron James trade plans clear\n\nWhy it's time for the Pelicans to move on from Zion\n\nThe Bucks have a looming $275 million Giannis problem\n\nTimberwolves want Coby White, but there's a catch",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nJeremy Lin took the NBA world by storm midway through the 2011-12 season when he moved into the New York Knicks' starting lineup and put together an extended stretch of big-scoring games. He had gone undrafted in 2010 out of Harvard University, not exactly a high-level basketball school, and was a seemingly invisible rookie with the Golden State Warriors, but he seemingly shot himself out of a cannon with New York.\n\nIt sparked a phenomenon people referred to as \"Linsanity,\" and even after the rest of the league adjusted to him and his production regressed to a more consistent mean, a sizable amount of the hype surrounding him remained.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the rebuilding Lakers acquired Lin in a trade with the Houston Rockets. By now, he was straddling the line between a low-tier starting point guard and a very solid reserve point guard. He played one season with the Lakers and started in 30 of 74 games while averaging 11.2 points and 4.6 assists in 25.8 minutes a game.\n\nHe left L.A. following that season and would have short stints with the Charlotte Hornets, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors before his NBA career ended. He finished with league career averages of 11.6 points on 43.3% field-goal shooting and 4.3 assists in 25.5 minutes a game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 17 — Jeremy Lin",

    "fullText": "The San Antonio Spurs are headed to the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, 132-119, on Wednesday, and might have Victor Wembanyama back in the lineup for the big tournament matchup. Following the team’s quarterfinal victory over the Lakers on Wednesday, Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson to reporters that Wemby might be ready to make his return from injury over the weekend.\n\n“Very much so,” coach Johnson said. “He had a really good day today. He had a very intense day this morning, and we’ll have to see how he responds or reacts (Thursday).”\n\nWemby went through an intense workout on Wednesday morning and then worked out again during pregame warmups before the Lakers game. He was able to get through that workout without any extra protection on his strained calf, according to Johnson.\n\nWembanyama has been sidelined with his calf strain and hasn’t played since Nov. 16. However, the Spurs have been able to get through this stretch and post a 9-3 record without their All-Star big man and defensive anchor. Wemby’s potential return couldn’t come at a better time as the Spurs will face the defending NBA Champion Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nIn Wembanyama's absence, other players like last season's Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle have had to step up even more to help carry the load. In Wednesday's win over the Lakers, Castle scored 30 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and dished 6 assists. De'Aaron Fox chipped in with 20 points, and Keldon Johnson scored 17 off the bench.\n\n“I think Victor would tell you we have a deep team, and we rely upon playing together as a team,” Johnson said. “He may be the biggest puzzle piece, but he needs everybody else to complete the puzzle.”\n\nAlthough Wemby has missed half of San Antonio’s 24 games this season, the Spurs are 17-7 overall and currently fifth in the Western Conference. When Wembanyama is on the court, he’s been as dominant as ever this season, averaging career-highs of 26.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, along with 3.6 blocks.\n\nSan Antonio and OKC square off in the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday, Dec. 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The NBA Cup championship game will be played on Dec. 16 in Las Vegas.",

    "fullText": "Any chance the Lakers had at trying to capture a second NBA Cup championship in the third season of the tournament evaporated for good in the fourth quarter against a young, fast and athletic San Antonio Spurs team missing its best player.\n\nThe Lakers won the inaugural NBA Cup title in 2023 and had designs on winning it again in 2025 and the $500,000 cash that goes to each player on the championship team.\n\nBut it was not to be — not with the Lakers unable to slow down the Spurs during a 132-119 quarterfinal loss Wednesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers got down by as much as 24 points in the fourth and made a run to get to within eight points late in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Lakers got no closer and now will face the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday.\n\nThe Spurs will meet the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in Las Vegas in the semifinals.\n\nLuka Doncic had 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists, Marcus Smart came off the bench to score 26 and LeBron James had 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. But that wasn’t enough against a Spurs team that had seven players score in double figures.\n\nStephon Castle led the Spurs with 30 points and De’Aaron Fox had 20.\n\nWhen the Lakers needed someone to lift them when they got down by 18 points in the second, someone to provide them a spark when there wasn’t one for so much of the quarter, they finally got it from the oldest player on the court, 40-year-old LeBron James.\n\nJames drove down the lane and threw down a thunderous dunk over Spurs 7-1 center Luke Kornet, bringing the Lakers to within eight points and charging up the crowd in the process.\n\nJames growled and yelled in the face of the reeling Kornet. The crowd stood and cheered, now happy that there was a Lakers’ awakening.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t hold on to that momentum, falling behind 70-58 at the half.\n\nAnd then when the third quarter started, the Lakers came out flat, giving up back-to-back threes and two more easy baskets for the Spurs to fall into an 80-60 hole early in the third.\n\nThe Lakers didn’t make it easy on themselves either.\n\nDoncic got a technical foul in the first quarter after no foul was called after Kelly Olynyk smacked him in the face and Lakers coach JJ Redick was called for a technical foul in the second quarter.\n\nWhen the Lakers last faced the Spurs a little over a month ago here, San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama played in a game L.A. won, but speedy point guard De’Aaron Fox did not.\n\nIt was the opposite this time, with Fox playing and Wembanyama out with a left calf strain.\n\nThe 7-5 Wembanyama has been out for almost a month and the super-quick Fox has been back during that time, which has changed the dynamic of the Spurs, which meant the Lakers had to shift how they played defense against San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs are more guard-oriented with Fox, Castle and Dylan Harper.\n\nThe Lakers got a taste of how much faster the Spurs are now in the first quarter, when L.A. gave up 39 points and trailed by nine after the first frame.\n\nThe Spurs show 56% from the field in the first, 50% (six-for-12) from three-point range.\n\nKeldon Johnson came off the bench to score 13 points in the first quarter for the Spurs.\n\n\"Yeah, they're running a lot of pick and rolls with Fox, a lot of pick and rolls with Castle and Harper,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said pregame about the Spurs’ new way of playing. “And all those pick and rolls lead to drives, those pick and rolls lead to kick-outs and catch two threes and then more drives. So, we've got to do a good job of containing the basketball and do a good job of contesting.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",
