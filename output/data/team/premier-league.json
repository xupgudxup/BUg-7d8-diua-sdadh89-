    "fullText": "Wembley Stadium, 4:59pm on 24 May 2025, was a seismic moment.\n\nWho can forget Tommy Watson’s 95th-minute winner against Sheffield United in the Championship play-off final?\n\nIt ended Sunderland’s eight-year wait for a long-overdue return to the Premier League and set the stage for the magnificent season Régis Le Bris and his side are currently enjoying.\n\nEight months on, the aftershocks of that day — and the paradigm shift it triggered — continue.\n\nI write, of course, in the wake of the departures of Dan Neil and Anthony Patterson, two of Sunderland’s Wembley heroes and mainstays of that promotion-winning side.\n\nMidfielder Neil started all but two league games last season — one of those absences due to suspension — while goalkeeper Patterson started all but four. Both also started all three play-off games.\n\nBut promotion changes everything. It always does.\n\nAnd with Sunderland stepping up a level, the summer was spent building a squad fit to compete in the top flight — a process that left Neil and Patterson among those squeezed out.\n\nSunderland fans loved seeing homegrown stars Neil and Patterson thrive last season, and they would have been thrilled to watch them test themselves in the Premier League.\n\nInstead, Patterson departed without making a top-flight appearance, linking up on loan with former Sunderland boss Alex Neil at Millwall for the remainder of the season. Dan Neil’s involvement on Wearside, meanwhile, was restricted to three substitute outings totalling just 13 minutes before he joined Ipswich Town on loan to play out the final months of his contract.\n\nSentiment is a fine thing, but there is little room for it in the upper echelons of professional sport.\n\nFor all Patterson’s undoubted ability, Sunderland upgraded last summer with the signing of Robin Roefs, while the arrival of Melker Ellborg earlier this year cleared the path for his departure.\n\nAnd while Neil was one of the first names on the teamsheet in the Championship, the equation changes when players of the calibre of Granit Xhaka, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra arrive at the club.\n\nSunderland are moving onwards and upwards, and with that progress comes inevitable change.\n\nNeil and Patterson are simply too good to become perennial substitutes or bit-part Premier League players.\n\nBetter, then, that both have joined clubs competing for play-off places — and perhaps more — at the sharp end of the Championship.\n\nTheir roles in Sunderland’s rise cannot be overstated.\n\nFor Neil, captaining his boyhood club to Wembley glory was the stuff of childhood dreams. And the image of him and fellow Black Cats fan Patterson lifting the play-off trophy together is one that will live long in the memory.\n\nBut Wembley was both a summit and a turning point. Neil and Patterson delivered Sunderland back to the Premier League, and in doing so helped usher in an era that ultimately moved beyond them. That is not failure or rejection, but the price of progress — and one Sunderland can afford to pay because of what they gave.\n\nFollow James Hunter over on X by clicking here!",

    "description": "This is a team which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",
    "fullText": "Monday’s convincing victory over Burnley has virtually guaranteed Sunderland’s Premier League status for next season, with more than a third of fixtures still to play.\n\nIt was also the sixth occasion where the squad has responded to a defeat with a win — that speaks to the mentality of the group of players who have been blended together from last season’s promotion-winning heroes and the carefully selected cohort of summer recruits.\n\nThe ability to bounce back after disappointing performances against the likes of Burnley in August, Manchester United in October and West Ham in January is testament to the belief that Régis Le Bris has instilled in what has proved to be the surprise package of the season.\n\nIt is not just the fact that this is a team full of talented players which gives the squad character. It is that the club have recruited talented players who have the right character to play for this club, and for this coach.\n\nFor a goalkeeper of his age and experience, Robin Roefs should not have the calm temperament to control his area in the manner that he does. Ahead of him, he has Nordi Mukiele whose will to win is demonstrated, not only by his galloping forays down the wing, but by his willingness to put his body on the line. Dan Ballard embodies the ‘Til the end’ mentality that dragged this team back to the Premier League, Omar Alderete has the ice-cool mentality and ruggedness of a South American gangster, and Reinildo wanders round the Academy of Light in January in a sleeveless vest, as if he was back in Mozambique.\n\nTrai Hume has continued to deliver the kind of no-nonsense, hard-as-nails performances that make his price tag the steal of the century, while Granit Xhaka patrols the midfield with the mindset of a military commander determined to deliver victory on the battlefield.\n\nBeside him, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra bring an African energy, skill, enthusiasm and joy that we haven’t seen since the days of Asamoah Gyan, while Enzo Le Fée’s creativity is only matched by his never-say-die attitude to win back the ball every single time the team loses possession.\n\nUp front, Brian Brobbey is delivering the kind of no-nonsense muscular front-man performances that the Sunderland faithful have been desperately seeking for years, shrugging off defenders like annoying flies. On the wing, Chemsdine Talbi not only grafts back defensively but has delivered the spectacular finishes that excite crowds.\n\nAdd to that the loveable Wilson Isidor, Wembley hero Eliezer Mayenda and ‘Mr Sunderland’ Luke O’Nien, and this is a group of players who deserve to be celebrated.\n\nAfter years of watching the likes of Jack Rodwell and others stealing a living from the club, and giving nothing for the badge, let alone everything, this is such a refreshing change. And that is why the fact that the club has only recruited three new players in January should not be a concern.\n\nThe recruitment team have set out their stall. If you want to play for Sunderland, the first question is ‘Are you talented enough?’ If the answer to that is ‘Yes’, the next question is ‘Are you the right type of player, do you have the right mentality?’\n\nRecruiting players who can answer ‘Yes’ to those questions is precisely why we can now spend the last third of the season worrying about how high this squad might finish in the Premier League, rather than whether we will still be in it in August.\n\nLook around at other sides who have prioritised ability over attitude, who have put together a group of players, rather than a team. It is the same approach that allowed Leicester City to achieve the improbable, if not the impossible, by winning the Premier League a decade ago.\n\nThis is a team — the only team unbeaten at home in the Premier League — which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",

Liverpool made the shock signing of Andy Carroll from Newcastle, alongside Luis Suarez from Ajax.\n\nSince then the window has had its moments, but the final day itself has been something of a damp squib.\n\nThe Premier League had its quietest ever winter transfer deadline day on Monday, with just seven deals completed.\n\nYet deadline day has not been packed for a while. In 2024 we saw 13 deals done, then 16 in 2023 and in 2022 it was 14.\n\nThe drama of deadline day has always been something of a quiet affair across the other top leagues.

    "fullText": "The transfers of Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz were two of the biggest in Liverpool's history.\n\nThe duo were seen as the best way for Liverpool to take their next step and to even replace Mohamed Salah in the future.\n\nAnd, while Wirtz is finally getting back to his best, it's clear that some new signings still need to be made at Liverpool.\n\nThis has caused plenty of confusion among the football world, with Paul Merson now slamming the recruitment process undertaken by Hughes.\n\n\"With all the money Liverpool have spent, the squad looks wafer-thin,\" Merson told Sky Sports in quotes relayed by The Mirror.\n\n\"Looking at it now, they got it horribly wrong in the summer.\n\n\"By going bang, bang with a load of attackers and thinking they were going to dominate English football for the next four or five years, it's backfired.\"\n\nEven though attackers were needed to replace Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz at Liverpool, they still spent far too much money.\n\nIsak and Wirtz alone cost the Anfield outfit around £240 million, which, for any team is a massive chunk of change.\n\nThe Reds have often spent their money wisely and have chosen to upgrade multiple areas of their squad, rather than splashing the cash in one place.\n\nAlthough the chances of a new player arriving before January's deadline day look slim, that doesn't mean that they can't eye up potential targets for the 2026-27 summer window.\n\nHowever, if Hughes, Slot and Edwards do end up drafting up a shortlist of potential targets, they must ensure that their entire squad is benefitting, rather than just one area of it.\n\nOtherwise, they could end up in the same situation all over again next year.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League had its quietest ever winter transfer deadline day as just seven deals were completed on Monday.\n\nNot a single arrival was confirmed until 19:04 GMT - four minutes after the window in the English top flight closed - with Crystal Palace announcing the signing of striker Jorgen Strand Larsen from Wolves in a deal worth up to £48m.\n\nClubs can make signings for up to two hours after the official deadline, as long as a deal sheet is submitted before 19:00 to provide extra time for the necessary paperwork to be completed.\n\nThere were five further deals confirmed after the deadline - among them, Sunderland brought in Ecuador winger Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht in a deal worth £17.5m, while Wolves signed midfielder Angel Gomes from Marseille on loan and replaced Strand Larsen with Adam Armstrong from Wolves for £7m.\n\nThat took the overall spending in the Premier League during the winter window to more than £390m.\n\nLiverpool did agree a deal on deadline day to sign defender Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes, but that move - and the payment of the £60m fee - won't happen until the summer.\n\nAll the done deals on deadline day in one place\n\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\n\nThe day's two big talking points involved Crystal Palace - Strand Larsen's arrival from Wolves and the calling off of fellow striker Jean-Philippe Mateta's move to AC Milan because of issues with his medical.\n\nOtherwise, it was a day largely devoid of transfer drama as none of the top-six clubs did any business.\n\nOne of the more interesting moves was a Premier League exit, as former England midfielder Kalvin Phillips moved from Manchester City to Championship side Sheffield United on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nThat move comes four years after City signed Phillips from Leeds in a deal worth £45m.\n\nOther deals confirmed late on included Nottingham Forest's signing of Borussia Monchengladbach defender Luca Netz, Chelsea winger Tyrique George's move on loan to Everton for the rest of the season, while Tottenham and Arsenal both announced an academy signing.\n\nA record £3.1bn was spent by Premier League clubs in the summer - significantly more than in the winter window.\n\nThe figure of £397m for this window isn't hugely down on previous winters, with January always more low key than the summer as it is a notoriously difficult time for clubs to recruit effectively.\n\nIt is even harder to do that on deadline day, but this one was particularly quiet, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe big outlay last summer will be one, while another could relate to a new system of Financial Fair Play (FFP) that will come in from next season.\n\nSquad Cost Ratio (SCR) will replace Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), meaning overall squad costs in the Premier League from 2026-27 will have to be limited to 85% of a club's revenue.\n\n\"There's always going to be a degree of anxiety as to keeping your financial house in order ahead of a far more active market [the summer window],\" Paul Macdonald of FootballTransfers.com said.\n\n\"Clubs wanted to ensure they were in a compliant position rather than having an additional headache of being hamstrung under the new rules.\"\n\nManchester City made the biggest moves in this window as they looked to give themselves the best chance of challenging Arsenal for the Premier League title.\n\nThey signed forward Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth for £64m on 9 January, while defender Marc Guehi joined from Crystal Palace for £20m on 16 January.\n\n\"The scenario now is Manchester City are chasing down Arsenal and the points gap is getting a little bit bigger, so you need those players who are ready to go and know what the intensity of this Premier League is like,\" former England and Manchester City defender Steph Houghton told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\n\"It's been a smart move from the club in terms of getting Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo. They've slotted in really well, which is testament to them.\"\n\nCrystal Palace's deadline day move for Strand Larsen meant they spent £83m in the winter window, having signed Brennan Johnson for £35m from Tottenham.\n\nAston Villa - who are third - were the only other top-six side to pay out transfer fees during the winter window. They spent £18.25m on bringing back striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas and £10.5m on winger Alysson from Gremio.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal did no business during the winter window, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool - fourth, fifth and sixth respectively - also quiet.\n\nWhile Manchester City spent money to bolster their squad for a title fight, at the other end of the table West Ham splashed out in a bid to avoid relegation to the Championship.\n\nThe Hammers, who are third from bottom and six points adrift of safety, spent a reported £21.8m on Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente and around £25m on striker Taty Castellanos from Lazio.\n\nTottenham, who are 14th, spent £35m on signing midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid, while Bournemouth used some of their money from the Semenyo sale to sign teenage striker Rayan from Vasco da Gama for £24.7m and Hungary midfielder Alex Toth for £10.4m from Ferencvaros.\n\nDespite a quiet deadline day, Premier League clubs still spent more overall in the winter window than sides in other major European leagues.\n\nThe next-biggest spending league was Serie A, with their clubs paying out a combined £205m in transfer fees.\n\nSassuolo were one of the most active Italian clubs, paying £22m for Marseille duo Ismael Kone and Darryl Bakola.\n\nIn Spain, the transfer window closed at 22:59 GMT, but La Liga business was quiet, with Atletico Madrid's £30m deal for Ademola Lookman more than was spent be the rest of the division's clubs combined (£20.3m).\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Captain Cristian Romero says it was \"disgraceful\" Tottenham had just 11 senior players available for Sunday's 2-2 draw at home to Manchester City.\n\nSpurs have lost nine players to injury in 2026, sold last season's top scorer Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace and only brought in two senior signings in the January window.\n\nIt is the second time in recent weeks Romero has spoken out on social media, writing in a now-altered post in January that members of the club's hierarchy \"only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies\".\n\n\"Great effort from all my team-mates yesterday, they were incredible,\" Romero, who had to withdraw with an illness during the 2-2 stalemate, wrote in a post on Instagram on Monday.\n\n\"I wanted to be available to help them even though I wasn't feeling well, especially since we only had 11 players available - unbelievable but true and disgraceful.\n\n\"We'll keep showing up and taking responsibility to turn this around, working hard and staying together. All that's left is to thank all of you for being there and for always supporting us, the fans.\"\n\nSpurs signed Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid and 19-year-old Brazilian defender Souza from Santos in the January window.\n\nThey added 18-year-old Hearts forward James Wilson on loan on transfer deadline day, but he will be part of their under-21s squad.\n\nIn response to Romero's post last month, manager Thomas Frank said the 27-year-old Argentina centre-back should keep some things \"internal\".\n\nTottenham wanted to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo in January but he joined Manchester City instead, with Frank saying on Friday the club \"did everything\" they could.\n\n\"The fans just want the best for the club, just like I, the owners, the staff, the players. Everyone wants the best for the club,\" added the Dane.\n\n\"But the transfer window is not Football Manager, unfortunately. It is not. It would be a lot easier, but also a little bit more boring.\"\n\nSpurs, who won the Europa League last term, are currently 14th in the Premier League and sit closer to the drop zone than the European qualification places, although they have made it to the last 16 of the Champions League.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): Ten men away at Aston Villa, I could have put the whole backline in. Keller has gone in and not only held his own as their number one, but continued to showcase probably why he left Liverpool. A lot of people would have said 'stay, Alisson is getting older, you'll get your chance'. He didn't, he went away and he has been fantastic for them and it is a team that suits him.\n\nMarcos Senesi (Bournemouth): Arguably one of the players of the season for me. He is really solid, goes about his business, gets everything done. Nothing is forced.\n\nGabriel (Arsenal): Leeds weren't poor, but Gabriel was solid and reassuring. He got the job done and knows the threat he poses from set-pieces. It was probably his best defensive display of the season.\n\nKristoffer Ajer (Brentford): Big, solid defender. He was celebrating making tackles in the first few minutes, which is not my cup of tea, but when you are doing it consistently all the way through and putting your body on the line, I'll give you a pass.\n\nEnzo Fernandez (Chelsea): Obviously he scored the goal that completed the great comeback. He gets a lot of stick, unjustifiably in my opinion. People don't think he's that good and maybe it's the price tag and because he won a World Cup that means they expect more. He is a good midfielder and a really good captain, and he looks after the ball when they are in difficult moments.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): I have been saying for weeks and months that with a player of that quality, it was only a matter of time before he settled into it. These past six weeks we have seen the real Florian Wirtz - dictating games, his passing range is unbelievable. The goals and assists have started to come now and he is looking really strong.\n\nAlex Scott (Bournemouth): It was a tough day for him because Wolves were decent. He has had a tough time after going away with England but has come back and has found his mojo. It's going to be an interesting back end of the season for him trying to make the World Cup squad.\n\nNoni Madueke (Arsenal): From thinking you are on the bench to finding out you are starting less than five minutes before kick-off is a massive turn of events. To be mentally focused to deliver, that is credit to Mikel Arteta and Madueke. They somehow gave the goal to him even though it was an own goal, but with a goal and assist he gets in the team.\n\nHabib Diarra (Sunderland): It says a goal and an own goal, but it's basically two goals for him. He was exceptional. The wide players absolutely killed Burnley and he was at the heart of it.\n\nDominic Solanke (Tottenham): It was probably the weirdest two goals he will score in his life. The first one is questionable but the second one is pure genius. To not only backheel it but to lob Gianluigi Donnarumma who is 6ft 6in is unbelievable. It is great to see him back playing. Can he have a late push now for the England squad? That is the question if he can stay fit.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Signing of the season? Probably. Another two goals and he looks like he is going from strength to strength, week by week. It's going to be really difficult for Alexander Isak to get back in.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a wonderful away performance at Elland Road. With Bukayo Saka getting injured in the warm-up there could have been excuses, but he didn't make any. He put Noni Madueke in and he returned the favour. It was a wonderful performance at a place where teams have struggled.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe January transfer window allows clubs across Europe to add mid-season reinforcements and make alterations as a reaction to their current positioning and squad health.\n\nSome clubs may wish to add players due to injuries, poor performance, or a strong first half of the campaign, which has positioned them to achieve more than they expected.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, may wish to move on from disgruntled players or get some cash for those who are slated to leave in the summer for free.\n\nThe Sporting News brings you a roundup of when the transfer window opens and closes across the major European leagues, who have come together in recent years to align their calendars with one another for a more streamlined process.\n\nMORE:Updated list of Premier League top goal scorers for 2025/26 season\n\nThe 2026 January transfer window closes for Premier League clubs onp.m. GMT (2 p.m. ET).\n\nThis is because the traditional closing date, January 31, falls on a Saturday, and as such it will close on the following Monday.\n\nLike the open date, the closing date is also matched for all of the major European leagues, meaning England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France's top flights all have the same closing date.\n\nThe only slight quirk is the time of day the window closes on. Serie A, Ligue 1, and the Bundesliga have synced with the Premier League perfectly, also closing at 7 p.m. GMT / 8 p.m. CET. However, the transfer window in Spain closes at 11:59 p.m. CET.\n\nThe January transfer window is a month-long period during which clubs can make changes to their roster.\n\nTechnically, a \"transfer window\" is actually a registration period, during which teams can register new players and make general changes to their league-official squad.\n\nPlayers acquired outside a transfer window cannot be registered until the new window opens.\n\nAdditionally, starting January 1, players who are out of contract in the summer are allowed to sign a pre-contract agreement with a new club, under certain circumstances (e.g. Premier League players can sign for a foreign team). They are still contracted to their current club through the end of the season, but they are able to sign agreements with a new team to take effect at the expiration of their current deal.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the intricacies of the handball rule in soccer",

    "fullText": "The transfer window closes tonight at 7pm after over a month of business across the Premier League.\n\nHowever, fans hoping to see late activity in the market at their clubs can keep the faith beyond 7pm.\n\nClubs are still allowed to strike deals after that time, provided they meet a specific rule that grants them a two-hour extension to finalise signings.\n\nA deal sheet is effectively a way for clubs to tell the Premier League that a transfer has been agreed – but they just need a bit more time to finalise the official documents.\n\nPremier League clubs can only use a deal sheet after 5pm, and it must be submitted before 7pm.\n\nIf all the relevant details are filled in, the Premier League grant an extra two hours for the deal to be completed.\n\nYou can see an example of a deal sheet below.\n\nArsenal signed Raheem Sterling using a deal sheet in summer 2024 – and once all media duties had been carried out, the Gunners ended up announcing the signing around 2am.\n\nHowever, this is only applicable to domestic transfers, and clubs must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight if they want to complete an international signing from abroad.\n\nThe Premier League describe the FIFA Transfer Matching System as follows.\n\n“When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on FIFA’s Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated.\n\n“The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details.\n\n“Our FA will request clearance and, as long as everything matches, the foreign association will issue clearance to the FA, who then informs the club and League.”\n\nIn years gone by, those in the English Football League (EFL) – meaning Championship, League One and League Two clubs – have also been allowed to submit a deal sheet for late transfers.\n\nHowever, the EFL have now put a stop to it.\n\nAn official statement reads: “In the EFL, all documentation must be provided prior to the deadline closing for the registration of a player to go through.”\n\nThere is – however – the presence of a ‘quick application’ which gives EFL clubs an extra 15 minutes to finalise transfers.\n\nIt is said: “If a club is in a Full Application at 10:30pm, they will receive a warning that states the system will open a Quick Application at 10:45pm, where only certain fields need to be completed.\n\n“In those last 15 minutes of the Transfer Window, EFL systems allow clubs to submit the necessary registration form without completing the full application process. Where they do this, the clubs then have a further 15 minutes to complete the full application process. This avoids clubs missing the deadline in circumstances where they have agreed and signed all necessary documents with another club and the player before 11pm, but still need time to complete the full application.”",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains why the right deadline day signing can transform your team's fortunes, but sometimes it is not just about the effect a deal has on the pitch.",
    "fullText": "Transfer deadline day has become an event for fans and something of a media circus in recent years, but it has always been an important day for managers, even before the current system of having transfer windows was introduced in 2002.\n\nGet it right - and get the player or players you want in at the 11th hour - and you can turn your season around.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't get important deals done or lose someone without replacing them, it can take the wind out of your sails and deflate a team involved in a promotion bid or survival battle.\n\nI never saw making late signings as a risk, because I always thought the players I was bringing in would make the team better.\n\nLooking back at the transfer deadline day deals I was involved in was really interesting. Yes, I had a few stinkers, but also some really good ones. A theme emerged which showed that if you can do good business, it can really change the fortunes of the team.\n\nAt Crystal Palace on the final day of the January window in 2014, for example, the permanent additions of Scott Dann, Wayne Hennessey, Joe Ledley and also Tom Ince on loan, sparked an amazing turnaround.\n\nWe were in a relegation battle and in serious trouble near the bottom of the Premier League when they arrived but we ended up 11th, 12 points clear of the bottom three, after securing our survival with three games to go.\n\nAll four new players were great positives who played a huge part in our improvement. I am not saying they upgraded the quality of our players but they gave us a better balance as a team, which I felt we lacked before they came in.\n\nGaining that balance enabled us to stay in the Premier League.",

As has been the case on too many occasions.\n\nAfter Sunday's incidents, many will agree with Murphy.",

Pep Guardiola’s side will be eager to pick up three points to move back within four points of Premier League leaders Arsenal. Mikel Arteta’s side sits seven points clear of City after their win over Leeds United yesterday. City will take on a Tottenham side that has struggled in the Premier League this season. Thomas Frank’s side has flattered to deceive in terms of their performance in the league. But they did beat City earlier this season, so a tough test awaits Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nHere is the latest City injury news and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of today’s match.\n\nThere are a host of players who are unavailable for today’s match due to injury for Manchester City. Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, John Stones, Mateo Kovacic, Jeremy Doku and Savinho are all ruled out of today’s match. Pep Lijnders revealed that Doku is set to be ruled out for between two-three weeks due to the calf injury he sustained in City’s win over Galatasaray. Lijnders also revealed that Ruben Dias is set to return to training on Monday. Today’s match comes too soon for Manchester City’s defensive leader but his return from a hamstring injury is imminent.\n\nManchester City will be boosted by the returns of Rodri, Marc Guehi, and Antoine Semenyo. Rodri missed Manchester City’s win over Galatasaray due to suspension, but he is available for today’s pivotal match. Guehi and Semenyo were both ineligible to play in the Champions League, but both return today in a huge boost for Pep Guardiola’s side.",

    "description": "After Chelsea's first comeback win from two goals down in a Premier League match, were Liam Rosenior's substitutions against West Ham genius or obvious?",
    "fullText": "It has been some start to life as a Premier League manager for Liam Rosenior.\n\nSaturday's thrilling comeback win against West Ham was Chelsea's third league win in a row since the 41-year-old replaced Enzo Maresca at the start of January.\n\nAnd, in one of his biggest tests to date, it was his drastic half-time substitutions that led to the Blues recovering from 2-0 down to win 3-2 and moved them into the top four.\n\nAfter making seven changes from their midweek Champions League win in Napoli, a limp first-half display allowed relegation-threatened West Ham to deservedly take control.\n\nBut, making three half-time changes, Rosenior inspired a comeback in which substitutes Marc Cucurella and Joao Pedro hauled Chelsea level with a goal apiece - before Enzo Fernandez's dramatic stoppage-time winner.\n\nCriticism can be levelled at Chelsea for a poor first half in which they were booed off, fully deserved to be two goals down, and raised further questions about the quality of their squad.\n\nAfter the match, Rosenior played down the importance of his substitutions, instead crediting the mentality of the players since his arrival.\n\n\"My biggest learning is there's a spirit and a fight and a resilience in this group that I really, really like,\" he said. \"I've demanded that from the first day of stepping in.\n\n\"We haven't had many training sessions, but we've spoken about reacting positively to setbacks.\n\n\"We've spoken about reactions to losing the ball, pressing, energy, intensity. All of that was there in the second half, which wasn't there in the first half. I don't put that just down to the changes I made.\"\n\nOverall, Rosenior's early reign, now four weeks old, has been characterised by grinding out results and impactful in‑game adjustments.\n\nHis predecessor Maresca ended his tenure after a breakdown in relations with the ownership and having dropped a league‑high 15 points from winning positions - prompting frequent criticism of his mid-match decisions.\n\nFormer Chelsea winger Pat Nevin told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Liam Rosenior went back to not exactly Chelsea's best team, but what Chelsea knew and the system they feel comfortable in. It now feels like tactical genius because they have won.\"",

    "fullText": "The trendy thing to do heading into today’s match was to doubt Arsenal, to find reasons why they’d continue to stumble, and to play up Leeds’ chances of getting a result against the Premier League leaders at Elland Road. The problem is when you peddle cheap narratives like that, you often wind up looking foolish. Arsenal made a lot of people look quite foolish today. The Gunners steamrolled Leeds 4-0 to help cure their slight malaise, lay down a bit of a marker, and restore their 7-point lead atop the table ahead of tomorrow’s matches.\n\nMikel Arteta seems to have hit all the right notes in his team meeting earlier this week and his players responded with an excellent away performance, the biggest away win of the season so far. Arteta went with a more physical lineup to start, which matched up well with Leeds’ high pressure, rough play. The home crowd were up for the match and their noise and fervor seemed to be influencing referee decisions. For the opening 25 minutes, it felt like it might be one of those matches — Arsenal control the game, get kicked all over the pitch without protection, get whistled for a bunch of fouls that aren’t being called the other way, and something weird / annoying decides a close game for the other team.\n\nIn a half of football without much of anything from open play, Arsenal unsurprisingly opened the scoring from a set piece. Well technically from the second phase of a set piece but still. The Gunners recycled the ball to Noni Madueke, who started because Bukayo Saka felt something in warmups, to fire in an excellent cross. Martin Zubimendi ran across the near post and deftly guided a header into the back of the net.\n\nArsenal doubled their lead eleven minutes later when Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlowe punched a Madueke corner into his own net. Set piece again ole ole, own goal again ole ole. That it goes down as an own goal is a bit unfair to Noni Madueke. His corner was curling into the goal and would have gone in on it’s own. Madueke had an excellent game, especially considering he wasn’t expecting to start. It’s unfair to Darlow too, who was well put off his punch by teammate Dominic Calvert-Lewin jumping with and into him at the near post. It’s not unfair to DCL, who minutes earlier got away without a yellow card for a nasty studs to ankle and foot challenge on Gabriel that, in my opinion, merited review for a possible red card.\n\nThe Arsenal second goal drew that prolific scorer Owen Goal level with Viktor Gyokeres for the team lead in PL goals with five. But the Swede reclaimed his spot atop the stats sheet midway through the second half (but not before he was too slow to shoot and was charged down from behind after being in on goal). In the 68th minute, substitute Gabriel Martinelli ran down a long ball in the corner. He worked himself free for a cross and hit an absolute peach of a ball. Gyokeres fought through a foul and touched it home. It was exactly the type of goal Arsenal brought Big Vik in to score and it put the game to bed.\n\nUntil Gyokeres’ goal, Leeds had been dominating the ball. It’s tough to say the home side were “on top” for that period because the possession was entirely sterile. Arsenal were happy to let them knock it around the middle third and perimeter. Anytime Leeds tried to penetrate and get the ball into a dangerous area, they were calmly rebuffed. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been feasting on action in the box from the penalty spot and in this season. But if the ball doesn’t get into that space, he can’t do much of anything. The Arsenal CBs consistently outmatched him — in the air, on physical strength, and on quickness to balls into him on the ground.\n\nThe opening 15-20 minutes of the second half weren’t pretty to watch, although I’d bet Mikel Arteta loved it. Leeds had three shots in the entire match and the only one on target was a tame header from a corner. The Gunners were extremely effective, completely blunting the home side’s attacking, burning 20 minutes off the clock at 2-0 up, and converting their second big chance to put the game away by stretching it to 3-0.\n\nFrom 60 minutes on, Arsenal had 10 shots, good for 1.8 xG and 2 goals. That’s how you kill off a game. Gabriel Jesus, who nearly scored immediately after coming on for Gyokeres, got the Arsenal fourth in the 86th minute. Martin Ødegaard found the Brazilian with an excellent progressive pass threaded between defenders. Gabby J’s control and turn was excellent, but it looked as if the opportunity had gone when he didn’t immediately pull the trigger. So often Gabriel Jesus takes that extra touch or two and ends up having his shot blocked. This time, he worked a second shooting window and calmly put the ball into the corner.\n\nToday’s match was a case-in-point example of why teams don’t play high pressure, more open football against Arsenal in the Premier League. The Gunners will match you for intensity, strength, and speed, grind you down, and smash you to bits once your legs have gone. As the clock ticked down, the announcers lamented that Leeds didn’t give it more of a go against Arsenal. But they did! They tried to play their way. They pressed high, played physical football, and got battered for doing it.\n\nLeeds United have a -11 goal difference this season, -9 of that has come against Arsenal. Before today, they’d only lost once since the start of December. They’ve been particularly good at Elland Road. The Gunners went in there and made them look like a Championship side.\n\nIt feels a bit odd to say because the Premier League leaders should be winning away to the 16th-place side, but this was an excellent performance by Arsenal and a quality win. Everyone spent the week questioning Arsenal’s credentials and mettle. People wondered whether the second-leading scorers in the Premier League could score enough goals to win the title. The team responded in a big way — two goals from set pieces, two goals from strikers in open play, and smothering defense.\n\nOver to you, Manchester City and Aston Villa. Will “struggling” Arsenal pick up points on their pursuers or will we end the weekend as we started it, just with one fewer game in which they might reel in the leaders?",

    "fullText": "Another crucial Premier League matchweek awaits, with title contenders, European hopefuls, and relegation battlers all facing defining tests.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City both face tricky away fixtures as the pressure at the top of the table intensifies. Several sides in the bottom half will view this round as a major opportunity to gain breathing room.\n\nWith injuries, suspensions, and recent form playing a key role, fine margins are expected to decide many of the fixtures. This gameweek promises drama across the table and potential shifts at both ends of the standings.\n\nBrighton extended their winless run to three matches following a 2–1 defeat to Fulham last week. The Seagulls have struggled in front of goal, scoring just once in each of their last three games.\n\nThis clash with Everton is expected to be a tight affair decided by fine margins. Brajan Gruda has been passed fit, while Diego Gómez remains a doubt.\n\nA second-half goal from Thierno Barry earned Everton a point against Leeds, extending their unbeaten run to three matches and lifting them into the top half of the table.\n\nJack Grealish has been ruled out for the season with an ankle injury, while Tim Iroegbunam is a doubt. Michael Keane remains suspended for the final match of his three-game ban.\n\nLeeds welcome league leaders Arsenal to Elland Road hoping to disrupt the Gunners’ title charge.\n\nThe Whites have enjoyed a strong run of form, losing just one of their last six matches, which has lifted them to 16th in the table with 26 points.\n\nGabriel Gudmundsson has an outside chance of featuring, while Jaka Bijol, Lukas Nmecha, and Daniel James remain close to a return but will miss this fixture.\n\nArsenal suffered only their third league defeat of the season against Manchester United last week.\n\nThe result cut their lead at the top to four points, leaving Mikel Arteta’s side with little margin for error. The Gunners boast an almost fully fit squad, with Max Dowman the only confirmed absentee.\n\nBottom-placed Wolves saw their four-game unbeaten run end with a 2–0 defeat to title contenders Manchester City. Despite an improved performance, Pep Guardiola’s side ultimately proved too strong.\n\nJean-Ricner Bellegarde has returned from injury, while Ladislav Krejčí is a doubt due to illness.\n\nBournemouth picked up a morale-boosting 3–2 win against reigning champions Liverpool to extend their unbeaten run to three matches.\n\nA dramatic 95th-minute winner from Amine Adli sent the Cherries’ fans into raptures and eased concerns following the departure of Antoine Semenyo. David Brooks remains a doubt.\n\nChelsea made it back-to-back wins with a convincing victory over an out-of-sorts Crystal Palace last week, with goals from Estêvão, João Pedro, and Enzo Fernández.\n\nThe Blues followed that up with a Champions League win over Napoli to secure automatic qualification for the next round. Confidence is clearly building under the Stamford Bridge lights.\n\nLiverpool bounced back from late heartbreak against Bournemouth by securing a resounding 6–0 win over Qarabag in the Champions League.\n\nThe victory guaranteed progression to the knockout stages and restored confidence. Ibrahima Konaté and Curtis Jones have been passed fit, while Jeremie Frimpong remains sidelined.\n\nNewcastle’s four-game unbeaten league run came to an end with a 2–0 home defeat to Aston Villa. Despite that setback, the Magpies remain in the top half of the table.\n\nJoelinton and Tino Livramento are ruled out, while Bruno Guimarães is a doubt.\n\nAston Villa returned to winning ways with a vital victory over Newcastle, moving them closer to league leaders Arsenal.\n\nIt was their first league win in three matches, and they followed it up with an impressive Europa League comeback against Red Bull Salzburg.\n\nYouri Tielemans and John McGinn remain long-term absentees, while Ross Barkley and Ollie Watkins are doubts.\n\nBrentford received a boost as Mikkel Damsgaard and Kristoffer Ajer avoided serious injuries and could feature after being substituted in last week’s defeat to Nottingham Forest.\n\nMichael Carrick will look to extend his dream start as Manchester United’s interim manager by securing a third consecutive win.\n\nVictories over Manchester City and Arsenal have lifted the mood around Old Trafford to levels not seen in years. Patrick Dorgu has been ruled out for ten weeks with a thigh injury, while Joshua Zirkzee remains a doubt.\n\nFulham’s 2-1 win over Brighton last week saw them move just three points behind Chelsea in fifth place.\n\nThe Cottagers have only lost once in their last five games, with two of them being wins. Kenny Tete has been passed fit for the Cottagers, while Samuel Chukwueze is a doubt due to personal reasons.\n\nNottingham Forest made it three games unbeaten with a much-needed win over Brentford.\n\nWhile their season has been inconsistent, recent results suggest improved defensive discipline as they aim to pull clear of the relegation zone.\n\nCrystal Palace continues to struggle, with off-field and on-field issues mounting.\n\nJustin Devenny is ruled out for three weeks with an ankle ligament injury, Philippe Mateta will not travel due to personal reasons, and Adam Wharton is suspended.\n\nSpurs host Manchester City in the standout fixture of the gameweek. Thomas Frank’s side have struggled domestically, failing to win any of their last five league matches and sitting 14th in the table.\n\nHowever, a Champions League victory over Eintracht Frankfurt secured automatic qualification to the next round. Micky van de Ven will undergo a late fitness test.\n\nManchester City returned to winning ways with a routine 2–0 victory over Wolves, their first league win in five matches. Pep Guardiola’s side face a tougher test this weekend, with Jeremy Doku and Rúben Dias both ruled out.\n\nSunderland slipped out of the top half of the table following a 3–1 defeat to West Ham.\n\nThe Black Cats have won just once in their last five matches but remain level on points with several top-ten sides. A clash with fellow newly promoted Burnley promises an open contest. Captain Granit Xhaka is ruled out through injury.\n\nBurnley picked up their third consecutive draw against Spurs last week, leaving them rooted in 19th place. The Clarets remain ten points from safety after 23 games, but Joe Worrall and Zion Flemming have both been passed fit for this fixture.",

    "description": "“At the end of the day, the fans care about staying in the Premier League and this has to have been the best season most can remember. So it’s thanks to those who got us here, but it’s time for the baton to be passed on,” writes Nic Wiseman.",
    "fullText": "With the current transfer window seemingly being used to ship players surplus to requirements, the news that Aji Alese has joined Portsmouth on loan prompted me to take a look at a typical team from last season and see how they have fared this year.\n\nTo do this, I dipped into my box of programmes and fished one out at random. And the game in question is Derby away on 21 January, which was a midweek game on a dank Tuesday night.\n\nWe had just had the chastening experience at Burnley the preceding Friday night, where Wilson Isidor failed to score two penalties in injury time.\n\nWe won the game at Derby 1-0 thanks to an Eliezer Mayenda goal in the 28th minute and Wilson inexplicably had a goal struck off, for reasons nobody was able to fathom. Even the scoreboard took ages to revert from 0-2 back to 0-1.\n\nThe team that night was: Patterson, Cirkin, O’Nien, Mepham, Hume, Le Fée, Jobe, Neil, Rigg, Isidor, Mayenda.\n\nRoberts replaced Mayenda and Ballard, Cirkin on 74 minutes; Abdul Samed replaced Rigg on 86 minutes and Leo Hjelde came on for Le Fée on 89.\n\nIt was only the second time Régis Le Bris had listened to my pleas for 4-4-2 all season. As it had worked so well against Sheffield United on New Year’s Day, I was desperate to see it again. The only memorable thing about the game was how stultifyingly boring it was. Pride Park is situated in the middle of a soulless industrial estate and there was no pub near that I could find.\n\nThe combined number of appearances that team (including used substitutes) have made this season is 119. Which ticks up to 132 if you include all players who played last season.\n\nThe departures of Dan Neil and Aji Alese this week have triggered much hand-wringing about the fact that these hard workers have been ruthlessly jettisoned this season in order to ensure we maintain our position in the Premier League. But the cold, hard facts are that these players haven’t been good enough to play in the Premier League. In fact you could say that the club has done well by the players in allowing them to go off on loan to showcase their talents. Especially in the case of Dan Neil, who has been allowed to go off to Ipswich on loan, until his contract winds down.\n\nThe trio who have stepped up from last season’s side are Enzo Le Fée, Dan Ballard and Trai Hume. All could be considered first-team regulars this season and make up just under half the total appearances from last year’s team. Le Fée was bought from Roma in Italy’s Serie A in the January transfer window and was brought in on loan as a statement with half an eye on us being in the Premier League this season. He is a bit of an outlier in this analysis.\n\nJenson Seelt can consider himself to be unlucky, as he made an assured debut against West Ham on the first day of the season, only to be injured in the second half and replaced by Omar Alderete. He was subsequently shipped out on loan to German side Wolfsburg.\n\nOf the team involved that night, two returned to their parent clubs from loan: Mepham and Abdul Samed; Roberts and Neil have been loaned out, seven have started matches this season and two (including Neil) have come on from the subs bench.\n\nTo be honest, more have been involved this season than I expected, with seven making more than ten appearances this season.\n\nThe club do seem to be doing well by those players as they look to find pastures new. Which will enhance the club’s reputation as looking after players’ interests.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the fans care about staying in the Premier League and this has to have been the best season most can remember. So it’s thanks to those who got us here, but it’s time for the baton to be passed on.\n\nThose who played last season, but not at Derby",

And what impact might that have?\n\nOne of the things about Arteta's Arsenal side which has been criticised is the Gunners do not have a clear goalscorer in the Premier League.\n\nThey signed Viktor Gyokeres in a summer deal worth £64m, but things have not clicked for the striker and he has just five league goals this season.\n\nBut the Gunners still have a hugely impressive record with the forward in the team, despite his issues in front of goal, and it is not only the Swedish international who has struggled to find the net.\n\nNone of the Arsenal frontline are particularly in top form.\n\nGyokeres – 0 non-penalty goals in past 11 Premier League appearances\n\nBukayo Saka – 0 goals in past 13 appearances in all competitions\n\nGabriel Martinelli – 0 goals in past 13 Premier League appearances\n\nNoni Madueke – 0 goals in past 25 Premier League appearances\n\nLeandro Trossard – one goal in past 11 appearances in all competitions\n\n\"Saka is the one that has really surprised us,\" said former England captain Steph Houghton on the Monday Night Club. \"For all the games he plays you think he has goals and assists, but to have none in his last 13 games is a surprise.\n\n\"He is one of their key players who is meant to be creating and scoring.\n\n\"We always thought Gyokeres was going to be the missing piece to the puzzle for Arsenal this season as the number nine.\n\n\"Sometimes, Arsenal become a little bit too predictable. Now teams have started to work them out. I feel as though they could be off the cuff more.\"\n\nArsenal have been Premier League leaders at this stage of a season three times previously, but only went on to lift the title once, in 2003.\n\nBBC Sport fan writer Laura Kirk-Francis said the feeling of nervousness was down to high stakes and supporters feeling like they have something to lose.\n\n\"It's a combination of a few things, but certainly there is some residual trauma about the two seasons where we felt on track for the title and suddenly fell away,\" she added.\n\n\"Because of that, I think we are all on edge searching for any signs that the same thing might happen again, hence the big meltdown after the Manchester United game.\"\n\nWith their last league title in 2004 and finishing behind Manchester City twice and then Liverpool last season, recent history does not bode well for Arsenal when it comes down to a tense finale.\n\nThey are currently clear of both City and Aston Villa after 23 games, with Liverpool 14 points behind in sixth spot.\n\n\"The nerves also come from a sense that this team feels deserving of silverware,\" said Kirk-Francis. \"Given the quality of the players, how consistent they've been, some of the performances at the beginning of the season - it's sparked a bit of desperation I think which leads to nervousness.\n\n\"I'd also say there are some parts of the fanbase who see this season as a now or never, particularly with Liverpool's fall-off and how shaky Man City have looked at times.\n\n\"The nervousness comes from a sense of having something within reach but knowing it could all fall apart at any one moment...and the only person to blame would be ourselves!\"\n\nArsenal are one of the biggest clubs in the world with a global fanbase, so the nerves among supporters are being felt both inside Emirates Stadium and in the wider arena, particularly on social media.\n\nAFTV on YouTube is one of the outlets synonymous with fan views and founder Robbie Lyle agrees with Arteta that fans and players need to embrace the challenge of a title race.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot more of these games between now and the end of the season,\" Lyle told BBC Sport at a Kick It Out event which is aiming to make the pub a more inclusive space for fans.\n\n\"Every team thinks, 'how can we stop Arsenal?' Keep it tight and get the anxiety flowing. This is what it is going to be from now until the end of the season.\n\n\"I still think Arsenal are good enough to win this league, I still think they are going to win this league. Just treat that as a lesson. In life you have lessons. That was a lesson on Sunday, go now and go and beat Leeds and let's get back on track.\"\n\nLike many Arsenal fans, the pain of missing out for three successive years, and not winning any trophy since the 2020 FA Cup, is a factor in why things feel so desperate.\n\n\"Three years in a row we have come second.\" added Lyle. \"Even though I'm trying my hardest to be calm, I'm thinking, 'oh no, we're not going to do this again are we?' I think it is just a natural thing.\n\n\"I have been to every game this season. We are the best team in this league - just go and win the thing now.\n\n\"We're trying to help them but we're nervous as well.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "As we dig into Premier League predictions for Week 24, one fixture jumps off the fixture list as one that could shake up the expectations for the top four picture, and that's Newcastle's visit to Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nYou could forgive Eddie Howe if he flat out hated Liverpool — yes, even after the Magpies ended their long trophy drought by claiming the League Cup with a win at Wembley Stadium last winter.\n\nThat's because Howe has otherwise been beaten by the Reds way more often than not during his dozen-or-so years managing against them with Bournemouth and Newcastle.\n\nMORE — Champions League playoff draw complete\n\nAnd at Anfield, you can basically forget about it.\n\nHowe's record is 2W-2D-19L all-time against Liverpool, with the wins coming at Wembley and St. James' Park. Anfield has been especially cruel to Howe, who was 1D-5L there as Bournemouth boss and is yet to claim a point from four trips there with Newcastle.\n\nIs that why he limited minutes for his preferred attacking trop of Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, and Yoane Wissa in the Champions League at midweek while giving Bruno Guimaraes, Kieran Trippier, and Jacob Murphy — two of whom are just returning to fitness — zero minutes at the Parc des Princes?\n\nMaybe, but Arne Slot's men produced a 5-0 lead after about an hour at midweek and won't have felt too stressed by their workload versus Qarabag, who are coincidentally the Magpies next opponent in the Champions League.\n\nCan Howe's Magpies shake off their history and scoop up a rare result on Merseyside?\n\n10am ET Saturday — NBCSN — Watch live on Peacock\n\nEverton won the reverse fixture but Brighton have been much better home than away this season. The Seagulls are 5W-5D-1L at the Amex and 2W-4D-6L as visitors. But Everton are now healthy in the midfield and can win a battle with several different combinations. Branthwaite’s return opens up a lot for the Toffees, and they may figure things out on Saturday. Brighton 1-2 Everton.\n\n10am ET Saturday — USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nThe Gunners attack is healthy and if their explosion is coming soon. That’s not to say they’ll snap out of it straightaway, but their slow run of form combined with Leeds’ stunning record against the big boys gives this the aire of regression to the norm. Team “2-nil to the title” returning this weekend?. Leeds 0-2 Arsenal.\n\n10am ET Saturday— Watch live on Peacock\n\nBournemouth have just one win away from the Vitality Stadium this season and they are bedding in a number of new components while missing key figures like Tavernier, Kluivert, and Adams. They have the tactical acumen to find a win here, but Wolves should show up with vigor and this could be a day of hope for Edwards’ boys. Wolves 1-0 Bournemouth.\n\n12:30pm ET Saturday— USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nThe Blues have been producing chances moving forward but also give up a fair amount of opportunities going back the other way. West Ham conceded a whopping 12 goals off corner kicks while Chelsea have been productive with their corners. A lot of this adds up in favor of the hosts, even if they had to deal with a Champions League match at midweek. Chelsea 2-1 West Ham.\n\n3pm ET Saturday — NBC — Watch online via NBC.com\n\nNewcastle impressed in the Champions League with a draw away to Paris Saint-Germain, especially since the Starting XI made it appear that Eddie Howe had one eye on this fixture. Liverpool hammered Qarabag at midweek and edged the Magpies in the reverse fixture, which saw 10-man Newcastle come back from 2-nil down just to lose late. Both sides are stretched so goals are on the menu. Liverpool 1-1 Newcastle.\n\n9am ET Sunday — USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nBrentford have not been great away from the Gtech Community Stadium, and any advantage given by Villa’s Thursday match in the Europa League has been minimized by Emery’s heavy squad rotation. Aston Villa 2-1 Brentford.\n\n9am ET Sunday— NBCSN — Watch live on Peacock\n\nMan Utd's turnaround under Michael Carrick has been quite a treat for Red Devils fans, and there will be plenty guessing that it will continue at Old Trafford against the Cottagers. The sides drew 1-1 at Craven Cottage and deservedly so, but the Red Devils may get enough extra juice from the home crowd to deliver another three points to their new boss. Manchester United 2-1 Fulham.\n\n9am ET Sunday — Watch live on Peacock\n\nPalace heads must be spinning with Oliver Glasner set to leave in the summer and Mateta possibly joining Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze as stars to depart Selhurst Park since the summer. Adam Wharton missing this game through suspension just adds to the misery. Forest won’t be as fresh but it’s not difficult to project at least something from the group. Nottingham Forest 1-1 Crystal Palace.\n\n11:30am ET Sunday — NBCSN — Watch live on Peacock\n\nSpurs’ injury list is long and they haven’t been great at home to boot. Anything’s possible as Frank knows how to play the underdog role, but the likely result lies on the side of Pep Guardiola’s visitors. Tottenham Hotspur 0-2 Manchester City.\n\n3pm ET Monday— USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nSunderland have regressed to the norm with regular xG losses over the past month. The question is whether their norm is higher than that of Monday's visitors. One might argue that the Clarets have been as unlucky as Sunderland's been fortunate, but the Stadium of Light feels like a tiebreaker here. Maybe that's the wrong word... Sunderland 0-0 Burnley.",

    "fullText": "The Scout's verdict is in ahead of Gameweek 24 in Fantasy Premier League as City visit Spurs.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side visit the capital on Sunday 1 February, with kick-off scheduled for 16:30 (UK).\n\nThe Blues lock horns with Thomas Frank’s side with the view of recording a third win in succession in all competitions.\n\nBut we face a Spurs side who beat Frankfurt 2-0 in the Champions League in their previous assignment, meaning we’ll need to be at our best to collect three points this weekend.\n\nAll roads lead to an enthralling clash in north London and FPL managers will have an eye on proceedings at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nRead the latest Scout report below ahead of Saturday 31 January’s 13:30 (UK) deadline.\n\nRayan Cherki (£6.7m) looks a great option for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) managers ahead of Gameweek 24 (GW24).\n\nThe Frenchman has created 33 chances this season, of which 14 have been big chances, meaning 42.54% of his chances have been big ones. This is team leading at City.\n\nHe has also created a chance, on average, every 30 minutes in the league this season, which is the most of all the regular starters at the Blues.\n\nCherki’s 45 crosses, can only be bettered by Phil Foden (£8.5m) across the City team and his 64 successful passes into the penalty box is ten more than the next most in Guardiola’s squad.\n\nChristian Romero (£5.0m) is Spurs’ form player. The defender has scored six goals this season including three goals in the last three matches in all competitions.\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Gibbs-White (£7.3m) and Matty Cash (£4.8m) are low-owned gems who can return points in Gameweek 24.\n\nGibbs-White has returned two goals, one assist, three bonus points and two clean sheet points in the last four matches.\n\nCash has registered an assist and two clean sheets in the last four gameweeks. This season he has created 19 chances, only eight defenders can better that.\n\nThere’s no membership needed to get up to four tickets per person for our FA Cup fourth round clash with neighbours Salford City*.\n\nPriced from £17.50 for adults and £7.50 for children, it’s a fun day out for all the family on Saturday 14 February.\n\nHospitality for this game starts from just £60 with a wide range of options to suit every budget!\n\n*Tickets are on sale to all fans who have purchased at least one home fixture. You must have had an active supporter number before Sunday 11 January and the previous purchase number excludes previous fixtures v Salford.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has admitted his side are struggling to find any consistency in the league this season.\n\nThe Reds are sixth in the table and have lost seven of their 23 league games.\n\nSpeaking after their 6-0 Champions League win over Qarabag, van Dijk said: “I think I said it, in the Premier League, the problem and difficulties that we’re having at the moment is that we don’t have the consistency.\n\n“We can’t, so far, build enough good performances this season. And that’s something we’re working at, it’s something we have to improve.\n\n“We know we can do it, but like I said, not on a consistent basis. That’s why we have been struggling.”\n\nLiverpool’s win over Qarabag featured substitute appearances from teenage trio Rio Ngumoha, Amara Nallo, and Trey Nyoni.\n\nAnd the Dutchman has also warned that the level of scrutiny faced by players could become even harsher for the “next generation” of footballers.\n\nHe said: “I know what comes if you don’t perform. If I don’t have a good moment or a good game, that’s just part and parcel of football. But I’m a human being, and all the players before me have been through it too.\n\n“I’ve mentioned this in previous interviews, I think it’s going to be even tougher for the next generation of footballers. I wish them luck, and I’ll try to prepare them a little by talking to them about it.\n\n“But going forward, it will be very difficult, because everything is so micro nowadays. Back in the day, you played, things happened, good or bad, and that was part of it. For the next generation, it will be very tricky, and I want to help in the best way I can by sharing my experiences.”\n\nLiverpool take on Newcastle on Saturday and will look to get back to winning ways after five league games without a win.",

    "title": "Arsenal, Mikel Arteta and the ‘fear of failure’ they are trying to banish",
    "description": "Arsenal players were encouraged to speak up about how they were feeling as Arteta looks to prevent a recent blip in their Premier League title race from snowballing",
    "fullText": "On the morning after Arsenal’s 3-2 defeat to Manchester United, Mikel Arteta realised his players needed one specific message. The Basque and team discussed the principle that “you can't lose something you haven’t won, so leave all that behind”.\n\nPlayers were also encouraged to speak up about how they were feeling. There had been a release.\n\nArteta and his staff are aware of a “fear of failure” discussion encircling his team, so he knew he had to make them look at it in a different way.\n\n“Let’s enjoy it,” Arteta said, as he spoke of how it can’t be like this week to week for four months. The message was a progression of his dressing-room speech immediately after United.\n\n“This is the journey you’re on if you’re going to win the title,” Arteta said. “It’s not always going to go your way.”\n\nIn other words, there will be setbacks, especially if a team is seeking to be champions for the first time. It’s rarely been smooth, despite the perception Manchester City have given.\n\nArteta is said to have pitched the speech at exactly the right tone, something that is more notable since there has been a tendency for such performances to send him further in the other direction; more intense.\n\nStepping back a bit, the Arsenal manager instead came to a realisation. He could see there was something deeper than a normal setback.\n\nThe speech did bring a shift in training, aided by a forgiving win over Kairat.\n\nWhether the message fully sinks in, however, is the next question.\n\nArsenal might go out at Leeds United pumped to make amends for Sunday only for Karl Darlow to make a big save early on or Pascal Struijk to clatter a forward. Then, all the same thoughts from Sunday might surge back.\n\nSaturday does have the feel of a hinge fixture, primarily because Arsenal have such a tough match at the same time that many insiders wonder whether “the biggest game is in their own heads”. They’d still be top if they lost, after all, but no one would even consider that. The talk would be loss of momentum, and belief.\n\nHence Arteta knowing he has to get his team playing with conviction again. Or even, the conviction they offer in every competition that isn’t the Premier League. That alone reflects the psychology around all this.\n\nIt’s also easier said than done, given the “pressure bubble” Arteta’s staff feel the team are in, one obviously expanded by fans and so much social media noise. That’s what long waits without a title do, especially as you get so close.\n\nHence Arteta’s will to try and stamp out that “fear of failure”.\n\nOne of his biggest challenges might be finding a solution, which is why Monday might have been be so important.\n\nOthers still feel it’s Arteta himself that could do with a chat, because of how emotionally he lives all this. Perhaps it’s where Josh Kroenke could offer counsel, from his experience of success with the ownership’s American franchises.\n\nOne complication with any solution, after all, is that it is Arteta’s own intensity that has fed this atmosphere. And while it should never be overlooked that the Basque’s energy was absolutely crucial in restoring Arsenal as a force - and this probably would not have happened without it - the wonder is now whether such an important strength may have to just be tempered to actually get over the line. Not a total reassessment, but a tweak.\n\nArteta’s coaching base, after all, is “trying to control every element of play”. This approach has taken Arsenal to the top, as they tend to win virtually every game on xG. Described as “a probabilities man”, Arteta believes that if you do that in 35 of 38 matches, you likely win the league.\n\nThat final gap to actual victory nevertheless fosters a sense of “trying to win a title by process” and whether he’s overlooking that final human edge required.\n\nA question has been asked over whether the team is now so overcoached it is no longer so geared for attackers to score.\n\nThat can be seen in recent player stats on individual goals and assists, but also in other tangible effects with players, and within games.\n\nIn the 0-0 against Nottingham Forest, for example, Arsenal mostly executed their gameplan and another day would likely have seen them convert an xG of 2.37 to win. Again, probabilities.\n\nBut that in itself arguably illustrated the difference between process and true end product necessary to win the title. People may be fed up with references to Sir Alex Ferguson’s United, but it was hard not to think of one recently resurfaced quote about chasing wins.\n\n“The risk is you shove people in the box, because other teams react... but the value in the risk, if you score in the last minute of injury time - the dressing room after was electric.”\n\nIn order to bring that risk, Arteta pushed for Eberechi Eze’s signing. Except, it was then noted the playmaker was suddenly out of the team much more after failing to track Matty Cash in the 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa.\n\nInsiders similarly talk of how decisions on shape and structure have recently taken precedence over creativity.\n\nAs a Pep Guardiola follower, too, there’s an argument Arteta suffers from the same issue the City coach did in the Champions League; that he becomes so fixated on a gameplan, meaning that there is then a vacuum if it falters.\n\nUnited showed this. At 0-0, Arteta’s plan was to stop transitions by stopping Bruno Fernandes getting on the ball. Arsenal duly had control, and it eventually produced - or perhaps processed - that first goal.\n\nIn the six minutes before Bryan Mbuemo’s strike, though, Arteta was getting increasingly frantic about player decisions and duels. Control gave way to a meeker conservatism, that manifested in the errors for the equaliser. After that, they just couldn’t get into the fight in the same way.\n\nSources say that dynamic has led to certain players becoming too conscious of defensive mistakes, an issue compounded by the feeling there is a “Premier League team” and “a cup team” and it takes a lot to change that. How close, for example, is Martin Odegaard to being dropped?\n\nIf Arteta does want to shake things up, that may happen this weekend. The Norwegian has been visibly struggling in duels, but Leeds are all about duels, which is where Mikel Merino may come in.\n\nKai Havertz is also viewed as transformative, just for how his pressing gets Arsenal playing much higher.\n\nThere is admittedly a fair question over whether the very “monotony” of so many midweek matches is having an effect, especially with that pressing. It’s also been a pattern of Arsenal’s recent seasons that there has been a December-January slump, and it was notable that 2023-24 brought the run to 89 points after a mid-season break. That just poses another reason for a mental reset.\n\nOn that, Arteta is a big tennis fan, and has previously spoken about a 2024 Roger Federer speech at Dartmouth.\n\nIn that, the tennis great spoke about how he actually lost 46 percent of all shots in his career. He just had to remind himself it was only ever one shot.\n\n“When you’re playing a point, it has to be the most important thing in the world, and it is. But when it’s behind you, it’s behind you. This mindset is really crucial because it frees you to fully commit to the next point, and the next point after that, with intensity, clarity and focus…\n\n“You want to become a master at overcoming hard moments.”\n\nArteta has perhaps realised that.\n\nArsenal are probably the best team in the country, and can win a lot this season. They just have to start playing like that again, rather than as a team that can lose a lot.",

    "fullText": "If you have listened to any of Arne Slot's news conferences this season, you will have heard the Liverpool manager refer to 'low blocks'.\n\nThe term essentially refers to a team's defensive shape - blocking space close to their own goal. The closer to their goal, the lower the block.\n\nSlot's side - who cruised to the Premier League title last season in his first year in charge - have struggled for fluidity and consistency this term.\n\nAnd one of the reasons for that, according to the Reds boss, has been their inability to break down sides who defend deep against them.\n\nBut Slot's mentions of low blocks have become so frequent that frustration has started to grow among fans.\n\nLiverpool legend Steven Gerrard said: \"He needs to stop mentioning low blocks. Low blocks have been happening against Liverpool since I was playing. That's just the way it is.\"\n\nHowever, Slot may have a point - with the Reds having faced the highest percentage of low blocks of any top-flight team this season - making up 26% of defensive tactics used against them.\n\nIn fact, the space Slot's side thrived in last year only seems to present itself against European sides in the Champions League, with Liverpool having scored nine goals - and conceded none - in their past two games in Europe.\n\nSo why are the Reds struggling against low blocks domestically, how are they trying to unlock them and what could they do better?",

    "fullText": "It has been quite the season in the Champions League for Premier League clubs.\n\nAll six teams are still in business in European football's elite club competition.\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester City are guaranteed to be in the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nAnd they could be joined by Newcastle, if they navigate a two-legged play-off against Monaco or Qarabag.\n\nEngland is the only country to have every team - nine of them - through to the knockout rounds across the three European competitions.\n\nHow is this success being viewed across Europe? Does it denigrate the new format? And why are Premier League clubs proving so powerful?\n\nSpain, which like England gained one of the two European Performance Spots for this season, has not fared well so far.\n\nOnly Barcelona are sure of the being in the last 16, with Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in the playoff round. Athletic Club and Villarreal have been eliminated.\n\nWhereas Spanish clubs used to dominate in Europe - Real Madrid won the competition twice in the past four seasons - this time they lost all but one of 10 meetings against Premier League teams in the group stage. La Liga clubs failed to score in seven matches and were beaten by an aggregate score of 21-5.\n\nBBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague describes it as \"a near-perfect storm\" which has been driven by \"collective wealth, elite decision-making off the pitch, plus a league environment that forces constant tactical evolution\".\n\nBalague added: \"The Premier League has the biggest budgets, but also professional structures - recruitment departments, data analysis, coaching teams and sporting directors - all working at a level that allows clubs to choose better profiles of players and managers.\n\n\"There is an advantage even before a ball is kicked.\"\n\nBalague believes only Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich can match English clubs in all the four areas of \"organised attack, structured defence, attacking transition and defensive transition\".\n\nEnglish clubs are now fully attuned to the European style, Balague says.\n\n\"Rather than imposing something radically different, they are adapting to what Europe now requires,\" he explained.\n\n\"Defensive composure, winning the duels, squeezing space and time, control of transitions and clarity in decisive moments have become more important than dominating by possession. All prepared in training by top managers and coaches.\"\n\nBalague pointed out that success in the league phase does not mean anything. The competition only really begins in the knockout rounds \"where English domination has been far less pronounced\".\n\nBut Balague added: \"In any case it feels almost impossible to stop for ever the domination of a league that brings every year double or more the income of other competitions.\"\n\nOf the seven meetings between German and English clubs in the league phase the Bundesliga clubs only picked up two victories.\n\nBut Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund are all through to the knockout stages, although only Bayern go straight into the last 16.\n\nGerman football expert Raphael Honigstein says few people are placing too much focus on the English success so far.\n\n\"The Premier League's dominance is just denoted as a matter of fact,\" Honigstein said.\n\n\"Kicker today wrote that the top eight reflect the hegemony [dominance] of the Premier League, or reinforces it. So it's just seen as a given.\"\n\nDortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt in the last week both lost to Spurs, who are languishing in 14th in the Premier League.\n\nIt is not just about the money but how it is being used too, though.\n\n\"The days of stupid English money are gone,\" Honigstein added. \"Suddeutsche Zeitung wrote that the Premier League had learned to actually use its riches more effectively, which explains their improved performances relative to recent years.\"\n\nHonigstein also said Borussia Monchengladbach and Qarabag having enjoyed success they could not not achieved in the old group-stage format.\n\nHe added: \"The fact that Inter and Paris St-Germain, last year's finalists, both didn't qualify for the top eight suggests that there is a healthy sense of competition and a bit of randomness.\n\n\"I haven't seen anyone make the link that the Premier League dominance somehow invalidates or diminishes the current format.\n\n\"That is again a very English obsession to think that everyone is always thinking about England. People are not.\"\n\nWhy have English teams dominated as Real & PSG face play-offs?\n\nEngland on course for fifth Champions League spot\n\nTrubin's 'miracle' - how Mourinho's Benfica stunned Real Madrid\n\nThe BBC World Service's Sport Today show debated the topic on Thursday.\n\nFilippo Ricci, the La Liga correspondent for Gazzetta dello Sport, said the best young stars now all go to England.\n\nRicci told the story of Carlos Vicente, who was considered to be Alaves' best player. Such is the financial strength of English football that on Wednesday he joined Championship club Birmingham.\n\nFrench football expert Julien Laurens believes the English dominance paints a picture of a low-quality season in which \"every league is suffering because of the calendar and the fixtures\".\n\nConstantin Eckner, a German football expert, backs the assertion that the competition is only just getting going.\n\n\"We don't know how Tottenham or maybe Liverpool will do in the knockout stage,\" Eckner said. \"There's still time and maybe the English dominance won't be that overbearing.\"\n\nAnd he stated only Bayern can compete as the \"second-best team in Europe behind Arsenal\" - a statement reflected by the final league phase table.\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool take on Newcastle United at Anfield on Saturday evening, aiming to end their five-game winless run in the Premier League.\n\nThe defending champions suffered a last-gasp 3-2 loss at Bournemouth last weekend, dropping outside the top four.\n\nLikewise, Newcastle tasted a 2-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa, ending a four-game unbeaten run in the competition.\n\nLiverpool put aside their domestic struggles and thrashed Qarabag 6-0 in the Champions League, sealing automatic qualification to the round of 16.\n\nThe Reds must now build on that momentum to arrest their poor league form and prevent missing out on Champions League qualification.\n\nLiverpool have lost twice at home in the league this season, but have picked up just 21 points from 11 games played on their patch.\n\nManager Arne Slot needs to strike a balance between defensive solidity and attacking rhythm for Liverpool to string results together.\n\nNewcastle arrive for this clash off the back of a 1-1 draw with holders Paris Saint-Germain in the UCL, booking their place in the play-offs.\n\nThe Magpies also risk missing out on UCL qualification, sitting four points behind fifth-placed Chelsea.\n\nNewcastle have won just twice on the road in the Premier League this season and have a poor record at Anfield, with only one victory in their last 30 visits.\n\nHowever, the hosts have struggled against teams that deploy a low-block — an approach Newcastle are likely to use here — potentially giving them a chance to secure a positive result.\n\nLiverpool’s injury list became lengthier after Jeremie Frimpong came off injured against Qarabag. He joins Conor Bradley, Giovanni Leoni and Alexander Isak in the treatment room.\n\nCurtis Jones’ availability is unsure, having missed Wednesday’s game due to injury, as is Ibrahima Konate, who is still on leave following his father’s death.\n\nFabian Schar, Joelinton, Emil Krafth, and Tino Livramento are all sidelined through injury for the Magpies.\n\nLiverpool (4-2-3-1): Alisson Becker, Wataru Endo, Ryan Gravenberch, Virgil van Dijk, Milos Kerkez, Alexis McAllister, Dominic Szoboszlai, Florian Wirtz, Cody Gakpo Mohamed Salah, Hugo Ekitike.\n\nNewcastle (4-3-3): Nick Pope, Lewis Miley, Malick Thiaw, Sven Botman, Lewis Hall, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Jacob Ramsey, Antony Gordon, Nick Woltemade, Harvey Barnes.\n\nStats from whoscored.com & transfermarkt.com",

    "description": "Five of the eight teams to qualify automatically for the Champions League were from the Premier League, so why have they been so dominant?",
    "fullText": "The Premier League is flexing its muscles in Europe as five English teams finished in the top eight of the Champions League to reach the knockouts.\n\nThat could become six in the last-16 if Newcastle win their two-legged play-off after they finished 12th in the league phase following a 1-1 draw at defending champions PSG on Wednesday.\n\nArsenal finished in first place with Liverpool third, Tottenham fourth, Chelsea sixth and Manchester City finishing eighth.\n\nHistory could be made if Newcastle progress through the play-offs as never before have there been six Premier League teams in the Champions League knockouts.\n\n\"That is dominant,\" said Spurs boss Thomas Frank.\n\n\"I think we all said for a few years the Premier League is the best league in the world and I think this is another sign of it.\"\n\nSo why have Premier League sides been so dominant against Europe's elite?\n\nThe most obvious starting point is the financial power of the Premier League, which significantly outweighs other leagues.\n\nSix Premier League sides sit inside the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League, while 50% of the top 30 come from the English top flight.\n\nTV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.\n\nLast summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.\n\nTo highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent in the summer window was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.\n\nMore money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big to increase their strength in depth as they finished first in the league phase of the Champions League and sit top of the Premier League.\n\n\"The biggest single reason that the English clubs have been dominant so far is the financial power of the Premier League,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Also, it is about how competitive they have got by fighting it out and being in and around each other - they have pushed each other on.\"\n\nNewcastle forward Anthony Gordon also says a more open style of play in Europe has benefited English teams, while the Premier League is \"more physical than I've ever known it to be\".\n\n\"I think in the Champions League, teams are more open. They all try to play. It's less transitional,\" he added.\n\n\"It [the Premier League] is like a basketball game sometimes, it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's a running game and sometimes it's about duels, whoever wins the duels wins the game. Or moments.\n\n\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game, more football based. Teams come and try and play proper football.\n\n\"In the Premier League, you see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces - it's become a lot slower and more set piece based, I would say.\"\n\nWhen is the Champions League play-off draw and how does it work?\n\nLiverpool top English club in Deloitte Money League\n\nIt is undoubtedly an impressive achievement for five - and potentially six - Premier League teams to reach the knockouts.\n\nBut was the fixture computer kinder for them than other teams?\n\nAt the start of the season, football data statisticians Opta analysed every team's Champions League fixtures and ranked them all to work out who had the kindest draw.\n\nArsenal's fixtures were ranked the third easiest, with Tottenham fourth, Liverpool seventh and Chelsea eighth.\n\nManchester City were deemed to have the 14th easiest fixtures while Newcastle - who played defending champions Paris St-Germain - were 32nd in the rankings.\n\nThe last - and only - time five Premier League teams made it through to the knockouts was in 2017, when Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed.\n\nHowever just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to the final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.\n\nWith five Premier League sides finishing in the top eight of this season's league phase, and therefore avoiding the prospect of facing one another in the last-16, there is the chance of a record number of English teams making the quarter-finals.\n\nHaving numerous English clubs in latter stages of the Champions League is nothing new with four sides progressing to the quarters in both 2007-08 and 2008-09, as well as 2018-19 - leading to an all-English final in 07-08 and 2018-19.\n\nNo other country have ever had four teams in the quarter-finals - this year England could have as many as six.\n\nBut the demands of playing in the Premier League alongside the Champions League takes its toll, which is why many managers were relieved to avoid the two extra play-off games.\n\n\"I still think it will be very difficult for one of them to go on and win it, just because of how difficult the Premier League is every week - whether you are fighting for the title or for a place in the top four,\" Warnock added.\n\n\"Clearly the English clubs are in a good position going into the knockout stages, though. Some of the other big clubs that we thought would peak or start to show better form - like Paris St-Germain for example - have not really got going yet.\"\n\nThe three other countries who had teams join English sides in progressing to the knockouts were Germany (Bayern Munich), Spain (Barcelona) and Portugal (Sporting CP).\n\nThat has left some surprises having to go through via the play-offs, with Paris St-Germain failing to get the win they needed against Newcastle to secure a top-eight spot.\n\nReal Madrid, meanwhile, were on the wrong end of a thrilling and dramatic match with Benfica.\n\nReal were reduced to nine men while a last-second goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin secured a memorable 4-2 win for Jose Mourinho's side that earned them a play-off spot.\n\nOther big sides who are facing the lottery of the play-offs include Italian sides Juventus and Inter Milan, along with Germany's Borussia Dortmund and Spain's Atletico Madrid - who were stunned by Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday.\n\nThe Norwegians have been the surprise package of the Champions League and their win against Atletico came just eight days after they beat Manchester City.\n\nThose results meant they are into the play-offs and have become the first Norwegian side to progress from the league or group phase in Champions League since Rosenborg in 1996-97.\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "description": "There is the live possibility that all six of the Premier League clubs finish inside the top eight to qualify for the Champions League last 16, with English dominance on the European stage reflective of a shift in attitudes",
    "fullText": "In the buildup to Arsenal’s trip to Inter last week, those at their London Colney training base couldn’t help notice a shift in mood. There was no tension, it was all rather relaxed. A largely second-string team then carried that onto the pitch by breezing through a 3-1 away win against last season’s finalists. Long-time club insiders couldn’t help contrasting to 20 or even 15 years ago.\n\n“No pressure going to the San Siro for a Champions League game – imagine that.”\n\nNeedless to say, it wasn’t like that for the Premier League games either side of that win. And while some of that may be distinctive to Arsenal’s first place and a complex about winning the title, it is actually a common feeling.\n\nLiverpool’s many problems have been much less pronounced in the Champions League, where they can still stamp on Real Madrid or go to a stadium as intimidating as Olympique Marseille’s Velodrome and pick off a win.\n\nManchester City may admittedly have more angst after Bodo-Glimt, but they’d probably have taken a home match against Galatasaray to secure automatic qualification before this began. Newcastle United have meanwhile been much less inconsistent, as Tottenham Hotspur have been a force. Most starkly, Burnley and West Ham United posed more difficult challenges than Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAnd this is where there has been a very definite shift.\n\nOne source relates a common view. “The Premier League is now psychologically and tactically more challenging than the Champions League.”\n\nThe European games are described as much less tense. Crisis clubs now look forward to the refresh of a Champions League week, a total inversion of 30 years ago.\n\nSuch claims will almost sound sacrilegious to anyone who grew up steeped in the competition’s mythology from that time, as this really isn’t what the Champions League is supposed to be about. It’s cast as the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nClubs that properly have qualification in the balance – like Antonio Conte’s Napoli – will obviously feel different, but that points to another major factor.\n\nOne is a long-term structural issue that these pages have discussed so much over the years. The Premier League has so much more collective wealth, as can be seen with how Marseille’s total revenue is lower than that of 14 English clubs, and close to half of Villa’s wage bill. Such forces have created a talent drain from everywhere else. Essentially, any time anyone starts to do anything good – and this is especially true as regards coaching – they are snapped up by an English club.\n\nThe only exception seems to be with the majority of truly elite stars. In what looks like a necessary counterbalance, such players – from Kylian Mbappe to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – are still attracted to the glamour of the European super clubs, who also tend to accommodate their wage structures accordingly. Some Premier League figures feel this is the one remaining area where the English competition is missing out, as if it doesn’t already have enough.\n\nIt is very much a coach’s league, though, as recent articles about the effect of pressing and set pieces on goals have illustrated. Many of the major Champions League clubs don’t have to think about this in the same way, repeatedly leading to the bizarre scenes of Arne Slot declaring his delight that European opposition don’t play in a low block.\n\nThey might have to start thinking about it if English dominance continues – but the wonder is how far that goes.\n\nAs we go into the grand television event that is the final group night – intended to make all of this worthwhile – there is the live possibility that all six of the English clubs qualify as part of the top eight. Arsenal are already all but confirmed as top.\n\nEven if all six don’t qualify, it says enough that it’s a distinctive prospect, to say nothing that six clubs from one country is already too much anyway.\n\nThere are figures at the top of Uefa who readily complain about how the “European space” was made impossible by Bosman and an economic context that ensures a concentration of wealth to an ever-narrowing area of the game, although questions could then be asked about decisions made and regulation.\n\nThis very Champions League model was partly intended to be a regulatory response to all this, but it might well have had the adverse effect.\n\nSo much of the competition feels like the stakes are so low. Even this week, Napoli vs Chelsea is one of the few matches that feels “big”, but it’s not like it’s a straight knockout: Chelsea have the safety net.\n\nIt’s another contrast with the Premier League. For all the bombast of the competition, there is constant noise and narrative around it; with these Champions League matches, many of them feel like filler with little consequence.\n\nBecause, no matter how you try to talk around it, even a Paris Saint-Germain vs Newcastle United that is about automatic qualification won’t feel the same as sudden death.\n\nTake the example of that Spurs vs Dortmund match. Would it have felt quite so forgiving for Spurs if it were a knockout? The energy would have been completely different. Dortmund themselves would surely have looked different, and perhaps prepared a more layered gameplan than something that just felt like it was for a weekly league match.\n\nAnd yet these strange stakes may also work another way.\n\nIt’s been said before, but there is a considerable irony to how the “prize” for the top eight is to avoid an extra two “punishment” fixtures, when the entire point of this expanded Champions League is that the wealthy clubs actively wanted more games. Arsenal badly needed a free midweek, so they played for it.\n\nWhat does that say about the football calendar and its effects?\n\nHence, a mere two English winners in this decade so far, despite all that wealth. Premier League teams get to the business end too exhausted, and after so much more competitive tension in their domestic league, where the European super clubs’ greater stars finally have that space to excel.\n\nLook at the fate of last year’s group winners, Liverpool. Arsenal might have to be conscious of that.\n\nPSG’s victory in the final, meanwhile, only fosters the sense that very little of this matters that much, even allowing for changes that mean knockout home games will be dictated by the table.\n\nWednesday night will, of course, still be fun. Goals will rain in. The table will constantly change, even if that works against any sense of drama, as there’s much to keep up with.\n\nThe Champions League is supposed to be about so much more than that, though. And it’s supposed to be about much more than a handful of clubs.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have not won the Premier League since Antonio Conte led them to the 2016-17 title - and facing the Italian's Napoli side on Wednesday brings that into sharp focus.\n\nConte's triumph came in the season when Pep Guardiola began his reign as Manchester City boss.\n\nIt was Conte's first campaign in England, too, and Chelsea enjoyed a club-record 13 consecutive league wins on their way to lifting the championship with 93 points.\n\nTheir fifth Premier League crown in 13 seasons matched Manchester United's achievement in that same period. Chelsea - or indeed United - haven't ruled the roost since, amid an extensive turnover of players and coaches.\n\nNine years down the line, we reach a dramatic finale to the Champions League's opening phase. Liam Rosenior's Chelsea need a win against Conte's Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona to go directly into the last-16 stage. Their hosts - Serie A champions last season - must win to stay in the competition.\n\nLike so many aspects of Chelsea's recent history, you'd struggle to write this script.\n\nThomas Tuchel's Champions League triumph in 2021, plus two Club World Cup titles, have been notable achievements since Conte's departure.\n\nBut in strictly Premier League terms, the peak of Conte's short stint at the wheel has not been repeated at Chelsea. They haven't really come close.\n\nRosenior, 41, is the latest of seven head coaches, not including interim appointments, to have led Chelsea since Conte was sacked in July 2018. He has been in post for a matter of weeks.\n\nSpeaking about Conte on Tuesday in Naples, Rosenior said: \"I have huge respect for him. Firstly as a player, he was a magnificent footballer. He then went on to - and still has - an incredible career as a coach.\n\n\"I think his passion as a player transmits to the passion in his teams and obviously when I was younger watching Chelsea play in the manner that they did, defensively so strong.\n\n\"[Eden] Hazard was incredible in those moments, and he [Conte] has gone on to prove what an amazing manager he is and he's won many titles, including an incredible title here last year.\"",

    "fullText": "It is not the first time Villa have tried to re-sign Tammy Abraham - they remained interested in him and were at the table when the striker previously moved.\n\nHowever, in 2021, when Abraham opted to join Roma, Villa were not the club they have since been transformed into by Emery.\n\nAbraham also turned down Arsenal on that occasion, as he viewed Roma's project under Mourinho as the ideal platform to progress - and the forward's time in Serie A should be viewed as a success.\n\nOne of the key factors behind his decision to return to the Premier League is a desire for an England recall, with this summer's World Cup looming.\n\nAbraham has not played for his country since starting against Italy in the Nations League in 2022 - and would have remained on the periphery if he stayed in Turkey.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has rediscovered his form in the Premier League for Leeds -so if Abraham can hit the ground running under Emery it could put him back in the selection conversation, almost four years since his last cap.\n\nAbraham also has two young children and the lure to return home for personal reasons was strong.\n\nChelsea had a buy-back option, but with the change of ownership at Stamford Bridge that was never on the cards.\n\nHe has taken a wage cut to join Villa, underlining his commitment, and having won the Champions League and Conference League he has the chance to complete a European hat-trick in the Europa League with his new club this season.\n\nThe return to Villa Park is seen as perfect timing, even if it has come sooner than expected and just six months into a spell at Besiktas.\n\nBut Emery's plan and vision for the striker convinced him - not that he needed much persuading.\n\nAbraham enjoyed his time in Turkey but the opportunity to return to the Premier League - and Villa - was ultimately too good to refuse.\n\nWe want you to have your say on Tammy Abraham returning to the Premier League to rejoin Aston Villa.\n\nDo you think this is a good deal for Villa? Will Abraham have an instant impact?\n\nGet in touch with your views here",

    "fullText": "Needing a positive result to avoid the Champions League knockout play-offs, Galatasaray are not the side Manchester City would choose to face.\n\nIn four recent meetings between Premier League clubs and the Turkish giants, Galatasaray are unbeaten. You must go back to December 2014 – a 4-1 win for Arsenal in Istanbul – for the last time an English side triumphed.\n\nIn 2023, Galatasaray finished above Manchester United in their Champions League group – sending Erik ten Hag's men packing in last place – thanks to a 3-2 win in their most recent visit to the north-west before taking on Manchester City this Wednesday (20:00 GMT).\n\nA chaotic 3-3 draw in Turkey followed. Then last season, they inflicted the only Europa League group phase defeat on eventual champions Tottenham.\n\nMost recently, earlier in this Champions League campaign, Galatasaray outplayed an off-colour Liverpool to win 1-0 thanks to Victor Osimhen's first half penalty.\n\nSo why do Cimbom – the enigmatic nickname for Turkey's most successful football club – have such a good record against English teams?\n\nAccording to assistant manager Ismael Garcia Gomez, it is because the Turkish league is the most English outside England – and Galatasaray is the most English Turkish club of all.\n\n\"I think sometimes with the more dynamic, transitional games we face against teams from England, we are very used to that,\" Garcia Gomez told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The Turkish league is not at the same level, but we are more Premier League than all other European leagues, more than Italy and Spain where the tempo is lower. English teams, the ones we face, we feel comfortable because they are open.\n\n\"I have never had the experience of working in English men's football, but I have experienced it as a fan. England is for the fans, the football for fans is the best.\n\n\"But Turkey, it has nothing to be jealous about. The atmosphere created in stadiums is amazing, I was fortunate enough to work across Europe, and the passion here is at the same level as any country we can name.\"",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nEmiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): Wonderful performance. It says 2-0 on the scoresheet, but if you watched the game it felt like Newcastle had the better chances. An xG of 2.18 for Newcastle and they didn't score so that comes down to him.\n\nIan Maatsen (Aston Villa): He hasn't actually been a regular. He does so much going forward for Villa with his crossing. He's not really known for his defending but I thought he shackled Harvey Barnes and put him in his back pocket.\n\nOla Aina (Nottingham Forest): The Brentford team he faced are well known for getting crosses in from the wide areas. I thought he defended excellently at the far post in Forest's 2-0 win, cleared everything. He was good at dealing with how people tried to run at him. He offered a lot going forward, too.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City): I know it's Wolves, so he gets a little less credit, but to instantly come in and get a clean sheet, you just saw the togetherness he brings. A lot of pressure on him going into a game where they have to win. He comes in and City get their first clean sheet in the Premier League since 1 January.\n\nJorge Cuenca (Fulham): A lot of people talk about Joachim Andersen and his range of passing. Cuenca is just steady and goes about his business, but he's always in control, never out of position - and again against Brighton. Very talented player.\n\nYouri Tielemans (Aston Villa): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile. He's slowly become Villa's most important player. He dictates the play, breaks it up, and does everything right. Very, very good player and that pains me to say as a Birmingham City fan.\n\nIbrahim Sangare (Nottingham Forest): Lost him during Afcon and it wasn't the same midfield. He is a pitbull next to Elliot Anderson; he does all of the ugly stuff and breaks it up. A fantastic footballer and part of a solid defensive unit, which obviously Forest needed.\n\nEmiliano Buendia (Aston Villa): Scored unbelievable goals, all vital for their team's attacking outlet. Buendia, for me, just showed that little bit of class and magic. I love to see players taking a risk.\n\nPatrick Dorgu (Manchester United): He's been unbelievable since Michael Carrick came in. That goal in the win at Arsenal was unbelievable and worthy of winning any football match in the world.\n\nEstevao Willian (Chelsea): Young, exciting player and got a goal and assist, but it was against Crystal Palace, so he doesn't get as much chat as the others.\n\nIgor Jesus (Nottingham Forest): In a weekend of strikers not being great, he was solid and Forest had two that ended up scoring. He battles and does all the ugly stuff well, and then he has that little bit of flair for his goal.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo (West Ham): A 3-1 win over Sunderland is huge - it gives West Ham a chance to stay up. If you look at the wins for Forest and now the draw for Leeds, West Ham would have been completely cut adrift. They've now given themselves a chance to get out of it. He gets that because of the biggest win of the weekend.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Former Premier League striker Alan Shearer has blasted Ruben Amorim, branding him “arrogant” after Manchester United’s thrilling victory over Arsenal.\n\nAmorim was sacked earlier this month after 14 months in charge as head coach. He led United to a lowly 15th-place finish last season and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur, but was still backed significantly in the summer and afforded more time to turn things around.\n\nWhile results saw a slight improvement this season, he remained dogmatically committed to his controversial 3-4-2-1 formation. He reverted to a back four on only one occasion, against Newcastle, and United won. Surprisingly, he then retreated to the three-at-the-back system that had put him at loggerheads with the media and supporters.\n\nSkirmishes between Amorim and the football leadership group reached a breaking point after the 1-1 draw with Leeds, leading to Amorim’s dismissal.\n\nMichael Carrick was brought in to replace the Portuguese and so far, the change has worked a treat. Carrick secured a dominant 2-0 win over Manchester City in his first game and followed that up with an incredible 3-2 victory against Arsenal last Sunday.\n\nIn both games against the top two teams in the Premier League, United were by far the better side and were deserving winners. The result vs. Arsenal catapulted Carrick and his players to fourth positions and in a strong position to secure Champions League football.\n\nSpeaking on The Rest is Football podcast, Shearer, Micah Richards, and Gary Lineker credited Carrick for the positive change while simultaneously scrutinising Amorim’s methods.\n\nLineker began, “It’s funny football, isn’t it? Because suddenly you go back to a system that perhaps suits some of the players. You bring back bit of experience in Harry Maguire, you bring back one of the star players in Kobbie Mainoo, and play him in there.”\n\n“You push Bruno [Fernandes] a little bit further forward where he’s a little bit more comfortable and can bring out his brilliance more. You get Amad playing as a winger and not as a wing back. And all of a sudden, it’s very strange, but things start to happen for you.”\n\nRichards added, “We kept saying it continuously, the players were playing out of position. Two number 10s, [Amad] Diallo in a number 10, [Bryan] Mbeumo in the number 10, why? They do the most damage from wide positions. I know Mbeumo is playing up front now, but he’s got the freedom to go where he wants.”\n\n“If you see the goals of Cunha and Dorgu, they are brave goals there, getting on the ball on the half turn and then driving, trying to make something happen.”\n\nJoining the conversation, Shearer questioned, “What on earth is Ruben Amorim sat doing, thinking, looking at those two performances? I mean honestly, I don’t know what he’ll be thinking.”\n\nLineker answered, “He’ll be thinking ‘Maybe I’ve got it wrong?'”\n\nRichards chimed in, “You buy into managers, because of what he did at sporting and it worked very well. Subconsciously you’re thinking, ‘Okay, we’ll give him a little bit more time,’ because it’s worked before. He’s come to a different league. He’s got players who can’t play in those positions, and we’re still waiting, giving him the benefit of doubt.”\n\n“But he got a result, playing 4231, and then he changed back to three at the back. It was madness.”\n\nShearer continued, “Yeah, absolutely crazy. The arrogance to say, ‘No, I’m not doing any other thing. This is my way or the highway.’ I mean, to not even shift or to accept that this is probably not working, ‘Maybe I should try something else.’ He put all his eggs into that basket, and if that didn’t work, he was done. And it didn’t.”\n\nThe trio discussed whether Carrick should be under consideration to be handed the job permanently.\n\nLineker joked that United should immediately offer their former midfielder a contract. Shearer insisted that it’s too early to reach any conclusions and that things will become clearer with time.\n\nCrucially, Lineker warned that tougher challenges await. He noted that while it is easy to be motivated for marquee fixtures against City and Arsenal, the true test of progress will be United’s ability to break down defensive, low-block teams.\n\nUnited are next in action on Sunday when they welcome Fulham to Old Trafford.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche wants the Premier League to ban towels from the sidelines after complaining about the time taken for throw-ins during his side's 2-0 win at Brentford.\n\nDyche believes it is taking too long for teams to get organised for what is essentially now a full-blown set-piece, particularly when throwers opt to dry the ball before hurling it into the box.\n\nBrentford's Michael Kayode was regularly seen reaching for a towel before launching one of his throws towards the Forest area on Sunday.\n\n\"They have towels on the sidelines. I can't work that out,\" Dyche said in his post-match news conference.\n\n\"Nothing against Brentford. It's the rules. How can a home team be allowed to decide if they have towels on the sidelines or not?\"\n\nPremier League guidelines state that towels can only be used provided they are made available to both teams at all times.\n\nDyche's complaint is that, in effect, the away team have no real say in the matter - if the hosts want to use towels they just have to do so equitably.\n\nIt is a different story in the EFL, which banned the use of towels or anything else to dry a ball before the 2023-24 season.\n\nDyche said: \"Why not in the Premier League, just go, no towels, just get on with the game? It just adds in another layer of things for us to talk about and for us to worry about.\n\n\"Just say no towels. Dead easy, isn't it? It's not rocket science. Why make it more complicated? It's unfathomable to me.\"",

    "fullText": "Vincent Kompany is still learning on his job.\n\nThe 39-year-old, now in his second season at Bayern Munich, is still in the early part of his managerial career, which began only in 2020. In that time he’s overseen highs and lows, having both taken Burnley to promotion and suffering relegation from the Premier League.\n\n“I don’t think that winning titles makes you a good coach, or getting relegated makes you a bad one,” Kompany reflected in remarks captured by @iMiaSanMia. “A good coach is someone who learns something new every year, regardless of whether we win or lose.\n\n“We’re in a good position right now; it’s all about the details. We simply want to be competitive. We want to prepare well for the matches where trophies are at stake, where it’s about going through or being eliminated. In those moments, we have to have the big players fit because they’re the ones who decide the games for us.”\n\nWhat else is there to say? You have to love Kompany’s mindset. It is no surprise, given who he is and how he approaches his work, that he has found success at Bayern. Now the club is reflecting these attitudes in just about every way: every day, a little step forward.\n\nAnd this year? The stars seem to be lining up for the Bavarians. It would be a surprise to see them not go far in the Champions League.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boosted their Premier League survival hopes by returning to winning ways with a disciplined 2–0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.\n\nGoals from Igor Jesus and Taiwo Awoniyi secured three vital away points and restored Forest’s five-point cushion above the relegation zone.\n\nThe result also consigned Brentford to a second consecutive league defeat and ended their seven-match unbeaten home run.\n\nForest arrived under pressure after mixed recent results but produced a composed display that balanced early incision with late control.\n\nThe visitors struck after 12 minutes through Igor Jesus, whose finish set the tone for the evening.\n\nOla Aina’s low cross deflected upwards off Rico Henry, allowing the Brazilian to cushion the ball on his shoulder, spin away from Kristoffer Ajer and drive a powerful shot across goal.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher got a hand to the effort but could not prevent it finding the far corner.\n\nIt was a moment of quality that drained the energy from the home crowd and rewarded Forest’s positive start.\n\nBrentford had threatened early, with Igor Thiago sliding wide inside two minutes after Kevin Schade broke down the left.\n\nThat miss proved costly as the hosts struggled to regain attacking fluency after falling behind.\n\nForest settled into a compact shape, with Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson controlling possession and tempo in midfield.\n\nThe Bees were disrupted further when Ajer and Mikkel Damsgaard were forced off injured before half-time.\n\nA brief spell of pressure followed, but Sepp van den Berg headed narrowly wide from a long throw on the stroke of the interval.\n\nThe second half was attritional, with Brentford enjoying territory but finding little space against a well-organised defence.\n\nMurillo and Nikola Milenkovic dealt calmly with crosses and direct play as Forest remained content to defend deep.\n\nClear chances were scarce, with Igor Thiago firing over from close range during Brentford’s best spell.\n\nAs frustration grew among the hosts, Forest began to sense an opening on the counter-attack.\n\nThat moment arrived with 10 minutes remaining when Gibbs-White released substitute Taiwo Awoniyi down the right.\n\nThe forward outpaced Van den Berg, cut inside and slid a composed finish beneath Kelleher to seal the win.\n\nIt was Awoniyi’s first league goal in a year and a significant milestone following his serious injury late last season.\n\nForest saw out the closing stages comfortably, prioritising shape and discipline as Brentford ran out of ideas.\n\nThe victory extended Forest’s unbeaten league run to three matches and provided a timely lift after midweek European disappointment.",

Villa are enjoying an excellent season in the Premier League and in Europe, and Unai’s teams are consistently well organised and full of quality. We know from previous matches what a tough test this will be, but it’s one we relish.\n\nWe approach this match off the back of an excellent night in the UEFA Champions League a few days ago, when we hosted PSV Eindhoven. We knew the importance of the game in the build-up, and we made a really fast start when Yoane Wissa put us ahead after eight minutes, his first European goal for the club.\n\nThis gave the players a platform to push on, and we continued to create a series of chances in a very dominant first half. Our reward came on the half hour when Anthony Gordon doubled our lead, which we took into the break. We also know that 2-0 can be a risky scoreline, and it was important to attack the second half with the same momentum, which we did.\n\nWe felt a third goal would put the game beyond PSV’s reach and Harvey Barnes provided this midway through the second half. We managed the remainder of the game and had opportunities to score even more. When PSV threw everything into finding a way back into the match, we showed the other side of our game and defended really well as a collective unit.\n\nThe players deserve huge credit for how they handled a game which we knew we needed to win as we aim to qualify to the next stage of the competition. Not only the eleven players who started the game, but the five substitutes almost played their part in an excellent team performance against a side who top their domestic league in Holland.\n\nDespite there being big matches in the Champions League and Carabao Cup on the horizon, our sole focus is always on the immediate challenge ahead, and today we return to Premier League action and a really important game as we continue to work hard to climb the table.\n\nThe atmosphere on Wednesday evening was really special and it inspired the players from the moment they walked onto the pitch. That is why we love playing at St James Park so much, and it was great to be able to celebrate the victory with everyone at the full-time whistle.\n\nWe never take this for granted and will need just as much support today, so please stay with us and in return we will give everything to rewarding your incredible loyalty.",

He was an unused substitute in four of those matches.\n\nThe England international was signed from Crystal Palace in August for £67m to add creativity to Arsenal's attack - he shoots freely, while his ability to open a defence in a flash means he adds an element of flair to the forward line that not many others in the squad have.\n\nThat makes the fact that he played just over 10 minutes in each of the recent 0-0 draws with Nottingham Forest and Liverpool, when Arsenal did not allow either of those teams to have a shot on target, even stranger.\n\nIf Eze is not allowed to showcase his ability when Arsenal need a breakthrough, the questions about where he fits into Mikel Arteta's team will keep coming.",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains the thinking behind Michael Carrick's backroom staff appointments at Manchester United, and what a manager wants from those roles.",
    "fullText": "There has been open criticism of Michael Carrick's backroom staff appointments at Manchester United, which is one of the most important issues any manager has to address when joining a new club.\n\nUsing my experience of that situation, I want to try to explain his thinking with the people he has brought in since he was named interim head coach, and how I believe what he has done can only be viewed as sensible. It's certainly a long way removed from the accusation that he has just brought in a bunch of his mates.\n\nMichael's aim at United is the same as every manager when you first arrive in a job. You want to establish quickly a clear and defined alignment between yourself and the different football departments within the organisation that you have just inherited.\n\nYou have to be clear on your objectives and set certain principles in the first few days - like a work ethic, for example - that are non-negotiable and must be made absolutely clear to players and staff members who have not worked with you before.\n\nBuilding a strong base with everyone pulling in the same direction takes time and, initially, it can lead to some forms of confrontation with existing members of the playing and coaching staff.\n\nTo be absolutely clear in communicating your intended direction for the club, I believe the manager has to appoint his own members of staff. I always wanted to bring in people I could trust and who were competent in the responsibilities I would delegate to them.\n\nA manager's job is fraught with pressures and if the most important aspects are not prioritised, the amount of work needed in other areas of the club can become a drain on his ability to perform, on game days or away from those match situations.\n\nThis is where your backroom staff is all-important, and it is the same at every club.\n\nI am sure Michael understands that winning games is the be-all and end-all of what supporters want but, behind the scenes, work has to be performed to generate a togetherness and belief in a way that will produce those winning performances.",

    "fullText": "St. James’ Park sets the stage for a gripping Premier League clash on Sunday afternoon as Newcastle United welcome Aston Villa to Tyneside.\n\nOn paper, Newcastle head into this fixture as underdogs, with the visitors sitting 10 points ahead in the Premier League table.\n\nHowever, the Magpies are in better form than Villa after putting together a four-match unbeaten streak in the Premier League (W3, D1).\n\nThe only blemish in that run came in a frustrating goalless draw against basement boys Wolverhampton Wanderers last weekend, which ended a three-game league winning run.\n\nDespite dominating proceedings, Newcastle couldn’t find a winner and will head into Sunday’s outing sitting 9th in the Premier League table.\n\nEddie Howe’s attacking unit recaptured their goalscoring form in the Champions League as the Magpies bounced back in emphatic style.\n\nThey claimed a comfortable 3-0 win against Eredivisie champions PSV Eindhoven at St. James’ Park, courtesy of goals from Yoane Wissa, Anthony Gordon, and Harvey Barnes.\n\nHowe will demand more of the same when his side return to Premier League duties, with the Magpies eyeing back-to-back home wins in all competitions.\n\nA win for Newcastle will also move them level on points with fourth-placed Liverpool as they look to reclaim their place in the top four.\n\nHowe would be wary of shuffling the XI that put PSV to the sword in midweek, but a fresh injury blow could force the Englishman to make one change for the Villa clash.\n\nNick Pope should retain his place in goal, with an unchanged back four of Kieran Trippier, Malick Thiaw, Sven Botman, and Lewis Hall ahead of the English goalkeeper.\n\nThe solitary change could come in midfield with academy talent Lewis Miley coming in for Newcastle skipper Bruno Guimaraes, who picked up a knock against PSV.\n\nThe Brazilian midfielder is ready to play through the pain. But Howe will likely protect the “pivotal” midfielder by giving Miley the nod alongside Sandro Tonali and Joelinton in midfield.\n\nAn attacking trio of Gordon, Wissa, and Barnes should also remain unchanged after their stellar Champions League display.\n\nWissa’s performance spells trouble for £69 million summer signing Nick Woltemade, who is on an eight-match goal drought since bagging a brace against Chelsea in December 2025.",

But both Pawson and the VAR official missed Kudus’ initial offence whilst conducting their reviews.\n\nPawson then returned to refereeing Arsenal in November, taking the Gunners’ away draw to Sunderland.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side are now on a three-game run without a win under Pawson, but they do have a positive record overall, with 18 wins, five draws, and 11 defeats with the official.\n\nThe last time he refereed this particular fixture of Arsenal vs Manchester United, the Gunners won 3-1.",

    "description": "There are claims from some people that the Premier League is dull this year, but the 0-0 draw can be a fascinating beast",
    "fullText": "The 0-0 draw between Wolves and Newcastle was the second goalless game of the weekend, and the 17th of the season. This is already more than last season, and six more than in the whole of the 2023-24 season.\n\nStalemates are often dull and are usually examples of strikers having off days or goalkeepers having a blinder. This is true for most of them, but the context of these games is so important. \n\nSunderland have been involved in three 0-0 draws so far this season, away at Crystal Palace and Brighton, and then at home to Man City. From our perspective, all three have been rewarding and were achieved thanks to back-to-the-wall defending and plenty of grit.\n\nThe Palace game was only the fourth game of the season, but looking back, it was the first that showed how solid we wanted to be. The FA Cup holders hammered Villa 3-0 in the previous game, but we were fantastic at the back to pick up a brilliant point on the road. \n\nDogged defending is a thing of beauty, and one that is overlooked far too often. There is an art in defending, and this season, having conceded 23 in 22 games, we’ve shown ourselves to be masters of this particular art. \n\nEvery point in the Premier League should be celebrated, and maybe that’s why a battling 0-0 draw feels so good. The Man City game was a perfect example of good old fashioned, honest, gutsy defending with players celebrating blocks and tackles.\n\nThis tough attitude should be commended, and there’s nothing wrong with grinding out results here and there. Promoted teams need to come up and be hard to beat, and five losses in 22 games prove we’ve done just that. \n\nThere may have been some boring 0-0 draws in the Premier League this season, but I wouldn’t class ours in any of these. Maybe that’s a Sunderland bias shining through, but at full-time against Man City, I felt as though I’d watched a proper game of football where both sides had chances, but both defences prevailed over the forwards, and it was a back-and-forth kind of game in this sense. \n\nThere has been talk that the Premier League this season is weaker and more boring than in recent years, which seems odd considering that, for the first time in a long time, more than one promoted team has come up and competed. Last season saw three crap teams get promoted and go straight back down with not much of a whimper. It’s almost as if the established sides don’t like it when promoted teams show some fight, which is what we and Leeds are doing in spadefuls. \n\nWe’ll probably have at least one more 0-0 draw this season, and when that comes, it will likely be just as gutsy and fulfilling as the three we have in the bag. I’m still full of pride for Sunderland thriving back in the Premier League and each block, tackle, and header is a step closer towards sealing our status in the top flight next season.",

Through our league [it] is very difficult,\" he added.\n\n\"I am dreaming to be here getting trophies and the Europa is one objective we have this year.\"\n\nDespite being the seventh-most successful club in English football by trophies won, Villa's last piece of major silverware was the League Cup in 1996.\n\nSancho scores first Villa goal to seal last-16 spot\n\nWho can join Aston Villa in Europa League last 16?\n\nAston Villa are on a superb run of form.\n\nThey have won 20 of their past 25 matches (D1, L4) with only Arsenal (21) having won more among teams in Europe's big-five leagues during that period.\n\nTheir blip on Sunday against Everton meant they missed out on the chance to move second, within four points of Premier League leaders Arsenal - Emery's old club.\n\nHe made six changes against Fenerbahce and his side dominated, with the 1-0 scoreline flattering the 28-time Turkish champions.\n\nAfter the match Emery praised his players for \"respecting\" the competition, adding he was \"so, so happy\" with their response.\n\nVilla's match-winner Jadon Sancho scored his first goal for the club on his 19th appearance since joining on loan from Manchester United in September.\n\n\"It's nice to have a manager that backs you and obviously believes in you,\" said the 25-year-old forward who has not played for United since August 2024, and whose contract with them expires this summer.\n\n\"He [Emery] just keeps on telling me to be positive every time I play. Every opportunity I get I'm going to try and do 100% and hopefully I can deliver goals.\"\n\nSancho has only started two Premier League games this season, but in the Europa League he has been in Villa's starting line-up for each of their past five matches.\n\nVilla have played 12 times since the start of December, and by guaranteeing a top-eight league-phase finish avoided a two-legged play-off in February.\n\nEmery still played striker Ollie Watkins for the full 90 minutes on Thursday, and star midfielder Morgan Rogers for 74 minutes.\n\nHe was also able to give Tyrone Mings his first start since November, after the defender recovered from a thigh injury.\n\nAmadou Onana, who has been out with a hamstring issue, was also given a late cameo off the bench and is another key player returning.\n\n\"[We are] building the team with some circumstances not helping us,\" Emery told TNT Sports.\n\n\"But next week we can finish the transfer window and hopefully we can get everything we need to complete the squad for the next months and the competitions we have.\"\n\nLatest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Aston Villa - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "There are no salary caps, no aprons, and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced",
    "fullText": "There are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced\n\nDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.\n\nCurrent commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver said then in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n\n“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”\n\nFor decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.\n\nYet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won the Premier League just about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.\n\nConcerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double as handy instruments to write off taxes for billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.\n\nLately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.\n\nThey can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.\n\nThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rules now tweaked to merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.\n\nMore tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)\n\nCertainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.\n\nThat’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.
