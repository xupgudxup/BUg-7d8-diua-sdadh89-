    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s reported long-standing interest in Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi could hit a snag: another top European club could beat it to the punch this month.\n\nThe German Rekordmeister had been tipped for contract talks with the English international, who is now in the final six months of his current deal and free to negotiate with other clubs as a free agent. However, a run of injuries to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City defense has created the possibility of an immediate transfer, according to reporting in the BBC.\n\nManchester City are exploring a move for Marc Guéhi this month, in the wake of defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias suffering injuries. Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter and Atlético are among the European clubs to have shown an interest in signing Guéhi on a free transfer. Liverpool remain heavily interested. It is understood Crystal Palace would consider selling Guéhi this month to avoid the scenario of losing their captain for nothing come the end of the season. Market regulations mean he can sign a pre-agreement with an overseas club from this month [@SamiMokbel_BBC, @BBCSport]\n\nMan City has dropped points again this weekend, this time to Chelsea, and is seeing its campaign to keep the pressure on Arsenal falter. The Gunners sit six points atop the league after 20 matchdays. Guéhi surely would not come cheap, but the incentives are aligning for all parties involved — and Bayern is in no position at the moment to throw in a bid. If Pep wants Guéhi, it is hard to see this not happening.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Manchester City defender Josko Gvardiol will have surgery later this week after breaking his shinbone in Sunday's 1-1 Premier League draw with Chelsea.\n\nCroatia international Gvardiol, 23, was withdrawn after 51 minutes against Chelsea, while his fellow central defender Ruben Dias also went off injured half an hour later.\n\nIn a statement, City said they were still trying to \"ascertain the full extent\" of Gvardiol's injury and his expected recovery time.\n\nIn a post on Instagram,, external Gvardiol thanked fans for their support and wrote: \"This is a hard moment, but it will never define me. I know who I am and where I come from.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'll fight every day to return stronger. I will rise again, better than ever.\"\n\nMeanwhile, City have recalled academy product Max Alleyne from his loan spell at Championship side Watford and he could be involved in the squad for Wednesday's Premier League game against Brighton.\n\nThe 20-year-old - son of former England cricketer and current Gloucestershire head coach Mark Alleyne - made 17 appearances for the Hornets after joining on a season's loan.\n\nBut with England centre-back John Stones also currently sidelined, that deal has been cut short as Pep Guardiola's side, who are exploring a January move for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi, try to tackle their growing injury crisis in defence.",

Also, where they are at as a dressing room – have they lost a bit of faith in the manager and what he is doing?\n\n\"They are in a position now where if Nottingham Forest were to beat them, you just start to worry.\n\n\"The problem you get with the new signings coming in too is they have not played in the Premier League, so it is how quickly they can adapt and play under pressure.\n\n\"There is huge pressure at that football club at the moment.\"\n\nEx-Aston Villa and Brentford head coach Dean Smith agreed and added: \"They've got new signings but I never think January is a great month for signings. There becomes a slight desperation when you're looking to bring players in.\n\n\"But they definitely need some players just to have fresh faces in the dressing room because they need a bit of change at the moment.\n\n\"I do [think Nuno is the one to get them out of trouble]. He knows the league, he's been in the league a long time, getting Wolves promoted a long time ago and he did so well at Nottingham Forest last year too.\n\n\"[But] nine games without a win and they need to turn that around quickly. The game against Forest on Wednesday is massive, they can't lose that.\"\n\nListen to the full discussion from 01:50:00 on BBC Sounds",

I want to wish him and his staff all the best. We need them to succeed – simple as that.\n\n\"But, as Chelsea's first black player, I would be lying if I said this doesn't move me. I broke ground back in the day and faced things no player should face, just because of the colour of my skin.\"\n\nCanoville, who was subjected to racist abuse in the 1990s after making his Chelsea debut, now works closely with the club through his charitable foundation and has seen changes since his playing days.\n\n\"Since then, we've had trailblazers: Paul Elliott, the first black captain; Ken Monkou, the first black player of the year and Ruud Gullit showing we could manage at the highest level,\" he said.\n\n\"What really strikes me about Liam is that he grew up and played not far from here – he knows this community. His dad Leroy has an MBE for his work tackling discrimination in sport. That's exactly what we do at The Paul Canoville Foundation with young people every day.\n\n\"When kids see someone like Liam managing their club – someone who looks like them, who's from their area, who comes from a family that fights for what's right – that's powerful. It shows them the path is there.\n\n\"So yes, it's a massive moment for the club, for London and for every young person dreaming big. But let's back Liam and let the man do his work.\"",

    "fullText": "Chelsea's stoppage-time equaliser against Manchester City on a freezing Sunday evening at Etihad Stadium felt a monumental moment in the Premier League title race.\n\nWith time ticking away, Pep Guardiola's side were edging towards a ninth consecutive top-flight home victory as they aimed to maintain the pressure on leaders Arsenal.\n\nBut City wilted late on by conceding to Enzo Fernandez's 94th-minute leveller, bundling in at the far post to leave the travelling fans delirious and the home faithful stunned at the final whistle.\n\nChelsea supporters celebrated an unlikely point wildly, during a tumultuous week in which manager Enzo Maresca departed the club, while City players' shoulders slumped, knowing they had dropped four crucial points in as many days.\n\nIt means Arsenal have been handed a major boost by moving six points clear of both City and Aston Villa having made a statement of intent by thumping Unai Emery's side during the week and edging past Bournemouth on Saturday.\n\n\"I don't have a crystal ball to look at what will happen in the future,\" said Guardiola when asked about the title race. \"The only thing I think [about] is recovering the players for Brighton on Wednesday. Of course we were closer.\n\n\"We played an incredible second half at Sunderland and today we didn't get luck but we scored a goal. Being clinical is part of all the stats. You can create chances, our expected goals is higher than everyone, but you have to do it. As the manager I said to the team, we played really good against this team.\"",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nEmi Martinez (Aston Villa): It is going to sound very strange because it was a very comfortable Aston Villa win, but he made some key saves from Morgan Gibbs-White in the second half - just after Nottingham Forest got a goal back and it went to 2-1. He just kept them in the game.\n\nMatty Cash (Aston Villa): He was excellent. He has been excellent for a few weeks now but a massive outlet for Aston Villa. When they are dominant on the ball, he's the outlet on the right-hand side and got a lovely little assist in there as well. He is the main outlet and he really jumps off the pitch when you are watching the games.\n\nMalick Thiaw (Newcastle): From November onwards, he has been exceptional. He had a tough time in Italy but he is delivering consistently now. He scores a goal, which always helps for any defender in this team of the week. Solid performance, delivered, was more aggressive and I feel like he is starting to get his bearings now and feel like he is the man at Newcastle.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): Goal and an assist with the flick-on. I just think when they first signed him from Wolves, I didn't get it. Now I do. Especially under Keith Andrews. He organises well, he moves the ball really strongly from the back. He is the leader of that team. Forget Jordan Henderson, he is the leader of that team. Obviously goals help at centre-back.\n\nBen Davies (Tottenham): I don't think this is a name I ever thought I was going to put in but Ben Davies, fair play to him. He plays only his third game of the season, starts, they had Djed Spence on the bench as well - which shows the level of professionalism and maturity that he continues to deliver - and he gets a goal. It just shows to me that you don't always have to be 37 and written off. He's 32 and he's already been written off, he's got a World Cup to hopefully go to with Wales. He is always fit and available, which is what I really like.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): Two goals, leader, future England captain - do we need to say anything else?\n\nMateus Mane (Wolves): Eighteen years old, England youth international, doesn't have any noise, hasn't got any brothers with T-shirts saying to 'free him and let him play'. He goes out, plays, scores goals, gets an assist, gets the penalty and just delivers with no fuss. How beautiful is that? No fuss. I saw his interview after the game, he doesn't complain, doesn't get too over the top, just simple. Love it.\n\nJohn McGinn (Aston Villa): He obviously has to be in here. Two goals, the second goal he is obviously buzzing because the keeper made it so easy for him - but it feels like he has had a love-hate relationship with Unai Emery for about three years now. It has started to come to fruition. He has been a really important piece for this Aston Villa side.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): He gets a goal and it probably should have been the match-winner for Man City if we are being totally honest. They will feel like they should have won that game. Reijnders has got three goals in his last four matches and that shows his importance. He is growing. He had a really good start and then I think the reality of English football caught up with him for a period, but now he has got his second wind and he is playing well. He is going to be really important if City are to try to catch Arsenal.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Like me, you probably took him out of your fantasy football team thinking he had fallen off a cliff, and then he has scored every week since. So that just basically says more about my fantasy football managerial ability more than anything to do with his performances! But he is the rock, the leader, making sure he is right up there for that conversation for Brazil with the World Cup squad. You've got Joao Pedro, Richarlison, Gabriel Jesus - these are the guys who are all being spoken about. Even Neymar, but he's the one with the most goals, he is the one delivering with the most performances week in, week out. I'm backing him to make the squad.\n\nCody Gakpo (Liverpool): It was a game where Liverpool will feel they should have won it, nicking it in the 94th minute and then obviously Fulham score in the 97th minute. I think it is just one of those moments where you look at the team and you think no Hugo Ekitike, no Alexander Isak, who is going to step up and score the goals? To be fair to him, he's done it all season and that's why he goes in.\n\nRob Edwards (Wolves): First win for Wolves, a massive game against West Ham. I think in those games, because I have played in them, you need your manager to be resolute. To get you up but not get you over the edge and I think he just had both the tactics and emotion of the game spot on. Didn't go over the needle, didn't go under it and his team obviously delivered a massive 3-0 victory which gives them a fight - because if they had lost that game, relegation would have been all done and dusted. Now, hopefully they can get another win in the week and build on that momentum. For right now, it's huge for him and thankfully it is the first time we say something positive about Wolves all season - so massive kudos to Rob and his team.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "Arne Slot spoke to Sky Sports after Liverpool's draw against Fulham: \"In an away game, scoring two goals should maybe be enough to win the game. It's not for the first time this season that we fight so hard and think we have a win but concede an incredible strike. We brought Joe Gomez in but they took it short. We missed out on a good result.\n\n\"We had our chances in the first half. We had a similar one with Cody Gakpo that they scored from. In an ideal world, we see a Liverpool team that is dominant but creates more chances. We scored two goals, scored two disallowed goals and hit the bar. Again, it wasn't enough.\n\n\"The players are giving everything they have. I have to keep in mind that I have to keep them available. Alexander Isak is out and I have to overload or play Hugo more, a player who has never played in the Premier League. You have to manage that. We still have 11 very good players on the pitch.\n\n\"It's not only for us, but many teams don't create chances every game. It's not perfect but at least we've created a few more chances today than last week.\"\n\nCody Gakpo spoke to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's disappointing for us. We fought very hard in the second half, dominated at moments and tried to create chances to get through. At the end I scored in minute 95, they scored in minute 97 - a wonderful goal to be fair. Unlucky, unfortunate.\n\n\"This is a moment that can happen in a game. I was just sitting down so I did not see the moments before. I just saw him take a touch and shoot the ball into the top corner.\n\n\"I think if you are going to analyse the game maybe we should have scored more goals or defended the two goals better. In the end we should do much better. There were moments that we showed how good we were but it is up to us to stay consistent and put in overall better performances. I'm sure the wins will come again.\"\n\nOn playing in the nine: \"As a forward player you always want to score goals to help the team so it's a plus for me. In the end it's a team sport and we didn't win so I'm still disappointed.\"",

    "fullText": "Liverpool faced off against Fulham at Craven Cottage earlier today as they hoped to secure a win on the road in the Premier League. The Reds made a slow start to the game and conceded the opener in the 17th minute when Harry Wilson found the back of the net. Arne Slot’s men went into the half-time break 1-0 down on the scoreline.\n\nFlorian Wirtz equalised for the Merseyside club in the 57th minute before Cody Gakpo gave Liverpool the lead in injury time. However, Harrison Reed scored a dramatic equaliser with a brilliant strike soon after. The match ended with Arne Slot’s players being held to a lackluster 2-2 draw at Craven Cottage.\n\nLet’s take a look at how each Liverpool player fared during the clash against the Cottagers.\n\nHe failed to make a save in the game and conceded two goals this afternoon.\n\nBradley performed his defensive duties well and made one key chance going forward.\n\nHe cleared the danger when he could, but failed to keep things solid at the back.\n\nVan Dijk was far from convincing with his decision-making but was tidy with his passing.\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND – JANUARY 04: Arne Slot, Manager of Liverpool, applauds the fans following the Premier League match between Fulham and Liverpool at Craven Cottage on January 04, 2026 in London, England. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nHe came back to defend when required, but failed to impress going forward.\n\nGravenberch did his fair share of defending but lacked quality in the Fulham half.\n\nHe engineered a few key chances in the final third, but there was no goal for him.\n\nSzoboszlai was quiet for most of his time on the field.\n\nCAM: Alexis Mac Allister – 6.5/10\n\nHe worked hard defensively but lacked creativity in the final third.\n\nWirtz caught the eye at times in and around the Fulham penalty area and managed to score the equaliser in the 57th minute.\n\nHe was not shy of having a strike at goal and managed to put Liverpool ahead in injury time.",

    "title": "‘Just a rumour’: Why Enzo Maresca to Man City never made any sense",
    "description": "The Italian was linked with a move to the Etihad Stadium to replace his former master, but the City boss has dismissed speculation as he bids to reel in Arsenal in a gripping Premier League title race",
    "fullText": "If Enzo Maresca’s last contribution as a Manchester City employee was to help them secure the treble in 2023, his most recent input to the discourse around the Etihad Stadium feels more unwelcome. The apparent indications that City’s former assistant manager had spoken to his old club about the possibility of replacing Pep Guardiola raised the issue of the Spaniard’s future.\n\nWhich has lingered in the background; as, indeed, it has for much of a reign that has extended for far longer than he originally envisaged. The Catalan shrugged off the idea that his old assistant had talked to City. “Why would I give you an update about an opinion that I don't know is about this opinion?” he said. “It's just a rumour.”\n\nGuardiola adopted a trademark blend of playfulness and faux arrogance. “You want to fire me?” he asked “My salary is so high, so I have one more year... I know you are bored of me, 10 years here. I will leave one day, I promise. But I have a contract, I'm happy, I want to fight with my team. I like to be here.”\n\nThat contract expires in 2027. If the idea is gaining credence that Guardiola could walk away 12 months early, that agreeing a deal of that length was actually to spare him a season of questioning this year, City are entitled to call such ideas speculative. The chances are that only one man knows if Guardiola will go in the summer. And perhaps not even that, if Guardiola has not decided yet.\n\nCity have reasons to compile contingency plans, but plan A remains the man with six Premier League titles and a couple of trebles; if Guardiola asked for a new deal tomorrow, it is safe to assume City would not decline on the grounds they had Maresca lined up.\n\nBut maybe Maresca’s unravelling at Chelsea illustrated the difficulties of replacing Guardiola. The Italian’s meltdown in the space of barely a month at Stamford Bridge might indicate he is ill-equipped for the job; Guardiola has his quirks but has found ways of managing elite clubs for 16 of the past 17 years. His methods have been more sustainable than Maresca’s.\n\nIf Maresca overplayed his hand with Chelsea by seemingly presenting himself as the most coveted property in football management, it would also rank as a surprise if he were actually City’s top choice. There is a school of thought that could be Vincent Kompany, another educated by Guardiola, whose children are half-Mancunian, but who has the complication of being Bayern Munich’s manager.\n\nMuch would rest on the timing of the vacancy, which in turn comes down to Guardiola. By the summer, Xabi Alonso may no longer be Real Madrid manager. Thomas Tuchel might be moving on from England. Each could be deemed a more credible candidate than Maresca. If Luis Enrique, Julian Nagelsmann or Mikel Arteta were available – implausible as any of that sounds right now – they should have an appeal.\n\nMaresca is not alone in learning from Guardiola: so did Cesc Fabregas and Xavi, besides Kompany, Alonso and Arteta. The Premier League’s status as a hotbed of managerial talent could provide a case for Andoni Iraola or Oliver Glasner, depending on who is the flavour of whichever month when City are looking. Despite his close friendship with City’s director of football, Hugo Viana, and their productive time together at Sporting CP, it is safe to assume Guardiola’s replacement will not be Ruben Amorim. Rewind 14 months, however, and the argument was made that Manchester United had to hire him to prevent City from doing so.\n\nSome may see parallels between Guardiola and Arsene Wenger, whose supposed successors faded away or moved elsewhere as the Frenchman went on and on. The City manager may prefer comparisons with Sir Alex Ferguson, who went out by winning the league. The most relevant example may involve his greatest rival, Jurgen Klopp. The German went of his own volition, before the end of his contract, after laying a platform with the creation of a new team.\n\nLiverpool 2.0 enthused Klopp even as he knew he was tiring. Guardiola has been given fresh energy by this younger, faster City side, even if the probability is that Arsenal will pip them to the title. Maybe Guardiola, in developing Nico O’Reilly and bringing in Rayan Cherki, Jeremy Doku and, perhaps, Antoine Semenyo, is preparing his own gift for the man who will take his seat in the dugout in due course.\n\nOne factor in Klopp’s decision was that he did not want to go out after Liverpool’s traumatic 2022-23. City experienced something similar last season in the worst run of Guardiola’s career. Perhaps it was a sign of his commitment that he did not walk away then. Nor was he fired. “The hierarchy respects me,” he said. “They proved it last season with what happened when we didn't win one game in two, three months.”\n\nIt was a way in which City showed they are not Chelsea. The sense has long been that Guardiola would never have taken the Chelsea job. But as he remains in a job and Maresca is out of one, it remains to be seen if a protege is ever offered the chance to take over from him.",

    "description": "As Leeds aim to beat Manchester United in the Premier League for the first time since 2002, BBC Sport looks at their intense rivalry before Sunday's Elland Road meeting.",
    "fullText": "In his best-selling 'Managing My Life' autobiography, Sir Alex Ferguson reflected on his feelings about a trip to Elland Road.\n\n\"The crowd invariably give us the impression that a lynching would be too good for us,\" he said.\n\nAfter a typically fraught League Cup victory there in 2011, Ferguson offered this observation too.\n\n\"I have always said Liverpool-Manchester United games are fierce in many aspects,\" he added.\n\n\"But it never reaches the levels of Leeds United. Never.\"\n\nLeeds have already hosted a couple of historic rivals in December, beating Chelsea 3-1 at home and producing an epic fightback to snatch a point in a 3-3 draw against Liverpool.\n\nBut a visit from Manchester United is something else.\n\n\"I have a decorating firm and for 40 years we have had the motto that we will not use red paint,\" said lifelong Leeds fan Gary Edwards.\n\n\"We will paint over red free of charge. It's still going to this day. It's on all the business cards and letterheads.\"\n\nThe actual origins of the rivalry are difficult to pinpoint.\n\nMany feel it dates to the War of the Roses in the 15th century, although that is probably too simplistic given the Duchy and Dukedom of the Houses of York and Lancaster had little to do with the cities themselves and the Duchy of Lancaster had land and offices in Yorkshire.\n\nOthers think the rivalry has its origins in the industrial revolution which does, at least in part, correspond to the emergence of football as an organised sport - even if neither club, either originally as Leeds City and Newton Heath, or their current names, came to real prominence until after the Second World War.\n\nPossibly, the reverence from the 1950s and beyond for the Busby Babes compared to the negativity around Don Revie's team in the 1960s and 70s, is a factor.\n\nThe knowledge that key players - Johnny Giles, Gordon Strachan, Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Denis Irwin and Eric Cantona among them - left one club to become an integral part of the success of the other is another. Also, the proximity of the best supported teams from the two biggest cities in two neighbouring counties, separated geographically, by the Pennines.\n\nWhatever it is, the rivalry is real and despite the early 12:30 GMT kick-off, Elland Road is guaranteed to be a cauldron as Leeds look for their first home victory over Manchester United in the Premier League since 2002, when Harry Kewell scored the winner.\n\nFormer England goalkeeper Paul Robinson was in goal for Leeds that day and told BBC Sport: \"One hundred percent it feels different.\n\n\"You get to the stadium two hours before kick-off and certain areas are sectioned off. There are police here, you can't drive there. This road is closed, that road is closed.\n\n\"It is as intense as any derby that you want to name in this country - and it is not friendly.\n\n\"I grew up as a kid in the Leeds academy and was a ball boy at some games. The away section used to be in the cheese wedge in the corner of Elland Road. For most of the season, nobody wanted to be a ball boy in that corner. But when Manchester United came to town, everybody wanted to be over in that corner, for whatever reason.\n\n\"It was just a different game and a different experience.\"\n\nNeither manager has been part of a Leeds-Manchester United game before.\n\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke knows it is a game that means a lot for his club's fans and is talking about making \"dreams come true\".\n\nManchester United's Portuguese head coach Ruben Amorim has been at the centre of the Dérbi de Lisboa, as a player for Benfica and a coach at Lisbon rivals Sporting.\n\nHe is not sure the comparison is particularly helpful.\n\n\"I heard it is a big rivalry and a big derby,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"It is hard to compare different cultures, different derbies and different histories. It's a game in a hostile environment and that is going to be hard for any player. But when you play for Manchester United, you need to be ready for everything.\"\n\nLeeds' last title-winning campaign in 1992 was made more satisfying because they won it at the expense of Manchester United, who were in control of their own destiny until a run of three successive defeats in the space of seven days right at the end of the season let Howard Wilkinson's side in.\n\nSadly for Leeds, the post-script came the following November, when chief executive Bill Fotherby rang Manchester United counterpart Martin Edwards to ask about the chances of bringing full-back Irwin back to the club.\n\nFerguson was in the room and said no to Irwin leaving, but told Edwards to mention the availability of French forward Cantona. It was a call that changed the course of English footballing history.\n\n\"I've never forgiven Bill for that,\" says Gary Edwards.\n\nMaybe one of the reasons why Leeds' rivalry with Manchester United doesn't spring to mind in the same way as others in England is the relative infrequency of it happening.\n\nApart from the 14-year spell that began with Leeds' top-flight promotion in 1990 and relegation in 2004, the two clubs met only eight times in the other 30 years from 1982. Leeds won once in 2010, as a League One side at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, and lost on five occasions.\n\nThe two clubs' fans don't forget though.\n\n\"Even when Leeds were in League One and the Championship, Manchester United still sang a song about teams they didn't like and tagged 'and Leeds' on to it,\" said Robinson, who had six years at Leeds before joining Tottenham in 2004.\n\n\"Week in, week out, no matter what league they are in or who they are playing against, Leeds fans take great pride week in describing their dislike of Manchester United.\"\n\nLeeds go into the game in better form, having added a goalless New Year's Day draw draw at Anfield to their home comeback against Arne Slot's men to take their current unbeaten record to six games and seven points clear of relegation in 16th place. It is their best top-flight form since April 2021, when Marcelo Bielsa was in charge.\n\nRegardless, Robinson believes there are some Leeds fans for whom a successful season this time around would be to finish 17th and beat Manchester United.\n\n\"That does exist,\" said Gary Edwards. \"I'm not quite like that, but 100% there are fans who think that way.\n\n\"I just feel it is as good a time to play them as any because we have turned a corner.\n\n\"We've kept the same formation and the same players who looked dire at the start of the season are now assured and confident.\n\n\"It will make the game interesting. Very, very interesting.\"",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are reportedly one of several Premier League clubs keeping close tabs on Watford sensation Othmane Maamma.\n\nOver the past few years, Watford have developed a reputation for identifying top football talent and selling them for significant profits, as exemplified by the high-profile transfers of the likes of Richarlison, Ismaila Sarr and Joao Pedro.\n\nOnce again, Watford seem to have a major sale brewing, with Maamma the player in question. Signed from Montpellier last summer for a reported fee of less than £1m, Maamma is virtually guaranteed to sell for several times that amount, thanks to his meteoric rise at Vicarage Road in England’s second tier.\n\nA two-footed winger, Maamma can be deployed to great effect on either flank. The 20-year-old has racked up 20 Championship appearances so far this term, contributing three goals and one assist in that period.\n\nIn what is his breakout campaign, Maamma has already cemented his status as one of Watford’s best and most important players, catching the eye with his ability to beat defenders with his ball control and unpredictability, explosive pace and remarkable composure.\n\nHe first shot into the limelight during the Under-20 World Cup, with the Moroccan winning the Player of the Tournament award. He followed that up with the African Young Player of the Year prize.\n\nAlthough omitted from Morocco’s recent Africa Cup of Nations squad, Maamma is on course to secure a place in their World Cup selection this summer.\n\nAccording to TEAMtalk, the youngster has popped up on United’s radar.\n\nTEAMtalk report, “Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United were all at Vicarage Road on Thursday to watch Watford starlet Othmane Maamma, TEAMtalk can reveal.”\n\n“Brighton, Brentford and Sunderland have also been watching.”\n\nThe report adds, “Watford paid Montpellier less than £1million in the summer, and although they are not planning a January sale, it would be hard to turn down a huge profit on the Moroccan if someone tabled an offer.”\n\nIt’s understood that this is not the first time United and other interested parties have sent representatives to see Maamma in action.\n\nSince Sir Jim Ratcliffe assumed operational control of United, the Red Devils have shifted their focus toward signing young talent, making their pursuit of Maamma a logical next step. It now remains to be seen which suitor will formalise their interest with a concrete offer.\n\nFeatured image Leila Coker via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nRobin Roefs (Sunderland): I think he has arguably been the signing of the season. Unbelievable the way he keeps performing to that same level and standard. He kept Sunderland in it against Manchester City with three or four great saves. The way that he has been playing and that backline has been playing, I could have just put that whole backline in. They were excellent and I thought he epitomised that.\n\nTrai Hume (Sunderland): We talk about Granit Xhaka, we talk about Roefs and we have spoken about individuals like Dan Ballard and the like but I think Hume has been their best performer throughout the whole course of it. Nobody is really talking about it.\n\nJaka Bijol (Leeds): At Anfield, everyone would have expected Liverpool to really, really do a job on this team here and make sure that they were ready to go. Unfortunately, Leeds are flying high. They defended resolutely and rode their luck, there was a massive chance for Hugo Ekitike to score and he probably should have but Leeds are in a good vein of form and Bijol has been an unsung hero.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): The game against Spurs was poor and the abilities and the attacking threat was poor. It was a defensive unit for both but I thought Nathan Collins was arguably the best defender on the pitch. Brentford continue their opportunity to stay in the league and that is going to be based on how defensively solid they are.\n\nMartin Zubimendi (Arsenal): Arsenal signed Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke and all of these other players that people were looking at. Probably their best bit of business was getting Zubimendi in early doors. He dictates the play, he's chipping in with a few goals as well now but he's really important to the way that they conduct themselves.\n\nJames Garner (Everton): He has played right-back, left-back, centre midfield, right midfield, you name it. He will play anywhere that Everton ask him to play. He does a job, not only is he a solid pro and a good kid but he never complains. When he's on the bench he doesn't complain, when he's playing he doesn't demand contracts and wages and things of that nature. A goal and an assist for him obviously helped Everton get a wonderful 2-0 victory at Nottingham Forest and he was a huge part of that.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): Is there a more dominant midfielder in the Premier League? I'll wait. 6ft 4in, can run all over you, can fight with you but also can do what he did against Burnley and score a goal after two minutes that was worthy of winning any game.\n\nDavid Brooks (Bournemouth): Brooks was the best player on the pitch for me against Chelsea by a country mile. He scored but it was just the way he took Bournemouth up the pitch. There are a lot of eyes on Antoine Semenyo and that he is probably leaving but I just thought that Brooks was fantastic in the way that he carries the ball and he will be the person who carries Bournemouth, not only to safety but to whatever position they end up in this season, it will be on his shoulders.\n\nLeandro Trossard (Arsenal): It's amazing to think that they were going to let him go. There was talk at the start of the season that he was going to be the one to come under the PSR rules. For me, he could be Arsenal's unsung hero of the year. He's now solved that left-sided problem which was an area with Gabriel Martinelli, then they brought Noni Madueke in, they tried Eberechi Eze out there. He's the starting left-sided player, it's just a given. Another goal, an emphatic goal but his work-rate and energy for the team is what's most impressive for me.\n\nYoane Wissa (Newcastle): First goal in two games. He's had a tough start since he got in to Newcastle after being injured but as a spark, he has a willingness to work for his team and an infectious personality that makes everybody else run if he is running. He's always smiling so that's why he gets in the team.\n\nJarrod Bowen (West Ham): When people talk about Bruno Fernandes, the first thing they say is where would Manchester United be without him? Where would West Ham be without Jarrod Bowen over the past five years? Honestly, the guy just keeps performing, takes the brunt of it as the captain and the face of West Ham. He knows what comes with that and the pressures that come with that but he keeps delivering and performing. Another goal for him in the draw with Brighton. If West Ham are to be safe this season, they'll rely on him heavily.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): Unbelievable result. Everyone looking at Arsenal coming up against an Aston Villa team that is in form and flying and looking at it as if they were going to struggle due to Declan Rice being out an a few others. It felt like this was a moment where Arsenal could potentially struggle. They didn't, Arteta found a way to win. It wasn't as easy as the scoreline suggested when you look at the first half chances for Villa. However, it was a massive win and a massive statement, especially when you look at Man City dropping a couple of points away at high-flying Sunderland.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola questioned whether it was only a two-horse Premier League title race, but his Manchester City side can ill-afford many slip-ups in their quest to hunt down leaders Arsenal.\n\nMikel Arteta's Gunners have struck the latest blow in this cat and mouse chase, four points clear at the summit following City's frustrating goalless draw at Sunderland on Thursday night.\n\nCity dropped points as the temperature at the Stadium of Light almost hit freezing on the first day of 2026.\n\nAnd Arsenal will need to maintain their cool if they are to claim their first top-flight crown in over two decades.\n\nCity had 67% possession and 14 shots in the North East, but were unable to break down a stubborn Sunderland defence who claimed a well-earned point.\n\n\"Two different halves,\" said City captain Bernardo Silva after the game. \"In the first half we didn't play that well. We didn't control the counter as well as we should.\n\n\"We attacked a bit too quick - we didn't move them to find spaces. Second half we had a lot more chances and today was one of those days we couldn't finish them.\n\n\"We are not happy because we wanted better than this.\"\n\nAs goalless draws go, this was an thoroughly entertaining one with both teams having chances to claim all three points.\n\nThe home fans grew in confidence as the match wore on but City could not find the key to unlock the defence as Sunderland maintained their impressive unbeaten record at home this season.\n\n\"If you look at Sunderland's home record I think it's a point well-earned,\" former Manchester City defender Steph Houghton said on BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"They [City] will overall be disappointed because of the chances they created but if you look at the likes of Arsenal and Aston Villa, to go there and get a point, we are half way through the season, there is a long, long way to go.\"\n\nJust like Arsenal in November, City could not beat the Black Cats.\n\nAnd Sunderland boss Regis le Bris was understandably delighted by the result, saying: \"I'm enjoying [it]. I think we showed strong character against probably one of the best teams in Europe at the minute.\n\n\"It was important to defend well. I think we were bold because we tried to be aggressive and high up the pitch. I think we disturbed their routine, maybe their flow and it was really important.\n\n\"We created a few chances as well, so it was a good game.\"",

    "description": "The Italian departs with the club fifth in the Premier League table, 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal",
    "fullText": "Chelsea have parted company with Enzo Maresca after a rapid fallout between the manager and the club’s hierarchy. The club have already begun making contingency plans, with Strasbourg’s Liam Rosenior now seen as the likeliest successor.\n\nMaresca’s future had been uncertain as far back as September, and a poor start to the season, but significantly escalated over the last week.\n\nThe Italian had even made a known dissatisfaction with his situation public, having made a cryptic comment about his “worst 48 hours” at the club after the 2-0 win over Everton on 13 December. This was understood to relate to his relationship with the hierarchy, and frustration over a perceived lack of support. The Independent had nevertheless been told that there was increased scrutiny on Maresca’s performance since September, despite trophy wins in the Europa Conference League and Club World Cup last season.\n\nRecent reports of Manchester City interest in Maresca in the event of Pep Guardiola’s departure also raised eyebrows.\n\nChelsea said in a statement: “During his time at the Club, Enzo led the team to success in the UEFA Conference League and the FIFA Club World Cup. Those achievements will remain an important part of the Club’s recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the Club.\n\n“With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the Club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track.\n\n“We wish Enzo well for the future.”\n\nThe Italian had a contract until 2029, with an option for an extra year, but his employment at Chelsea has now ended by mutual agreement.\n\nRosenior is highly rated by the Chelsea hierarchy, and has long been earmarked as a future coach. It is felt that this is why he was initially put in at Strasbourg, who are also owned by the Chelsea ownership, where admiration for his work has only increased.\n\nThere has already been progress by the club with Rosenior, but the ownership want to ensure that there is a clear succession at Strasbourg to continue the French club’s good performance this season.\n\nAndoni Iraola is also an option, and his Bournemouth side’s 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge may now prove to be Maresca’s last game. That result made it just one win in seven games for Chelsea, with tension only increasing when the Italian said he felt too unwell to do his post-game press conference.\n\nThere also remains bafflement about how he dropped in the comment about the “worst 48 hours” and his aggravation with “many people”, before refusing to explain what any of it meant.\n\nOther sources say Maresca himself had become increasingly irritated with elements of the Chelsea project and how the football side is run. He is said to want more power over recruitment decisions, but the club do not want to change the current “head coach” structure.\n\nThey also do not like the idea of mid-season coaching changes after the chaos of 2022-23, which saw Thomas Tuchel depart for Graham Potter, before the latter left in March.\n\nSky Sports later reported that the decision to part ways with Maresca stemmed from a breakdown in the relationship between the manager and the club’s hierarchy.\n\nAs part of the coverage for Liverpool versus Leeds, Dave Jones reported that an unofficial briefing from Chelsea explained how Maresca had ‘a lack of mental fortitude and emotional maturity’.\n\nJones said: \"The 48 hour comment was directed at the medical team at Stamford Bridge that he wasn't happy with. There is a suggestion Maresca went against the advice of the medical team at Chelsea on a number occasions. Playing players returning from injury longer than advised, leading to them being re-injured this season.\n\n\"He did not face the media on Tuesday and he wasn't ill we are being told. It is also being briefed that he spoke to Manchester City and Juventus since October. Despite briefing the club [Chelsea], they thought it was disrespectful.\n\n\"The feeling at Chelsea is that he has a lack of mental fortitude and emotional maturity.\"\n\nThe Italian departs with the club fifth in the Premier League table – 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal – following one win from their last seven top-flight games. Chelsea return to action on Sunday away to City, the first of nine fixtures across four competitions during a packed January schedule.",

    "fullText": "The summer transfer window saw 25 players move between Serie A and the Premier League, with 12 moving to England and 13 to Italy. Here is a reminder of who they all were.\n\nTijjani Reijnders was the biggest mover between Serie A and Premier League clubs over the summer transfer window. If all add-ons are included and all bonuses met, the Dutchman’s move from Milan to Manchester City could end up surpassing the €70m mark.\n\nAmong the notable movers from Serie A to the Premier League in the summer was Bologna’s Coppa Italia hero Dan Ndoye, who joined Nottingham Forest for a fee in the region of €40m. Milan sold centre-back Malick Thiaw to Newcastle United for a fee that was also reported to be worth €40m all-in.\n\nOfficial: Malick Thiaw joins Newcast;e United from Milan.\n\nMilan sold or loaned more players to the Premier League than any other Serie A club. Alex Jimenez was sent to AFC Bournemouth, while Samuel Chukwueze has found form with Fulham.\n\nOf the players moving in the opposite direction, Napoli’s signing of Kevin De Bruyne, technically a free agent after his 11 years with Manchester City, was one of the most exciting pieces of business over the summer.\n\nThere was also a lot of excitement to see Jamie Vardy have a go in Serie A after he left Leicester City and ended up joining newly-promoted Cremonese on a free transfer.\n\nVERONA, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 15: Jamie Vardy of US Cremonese looks on during the Serie A match between Hellas Verona FC and US Cremonese at Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi on September 15, 2025 in Verona, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\nRasmus Hojlund’s move from Manchester United to Napoli has got off to a roaring success, and there have already been suggestions that his €50m buy-out clause could be somewhat of a bargain.\n\nThe most expensive player to move from the Premier League to Serie A over the summer was Christopher Nkunku, who joined Milan from Chelsea in a deal that could be worth up to €43m if all bonuses are met.\n\nOfficial: Dan Ndoye joins Nottingham Forest in a permanent deal from Bologna.

All of a sudden, you've lost three when it could have been certainly a couple [of wins], if not three draws. So it's frustrating in that respect because of the softness of the goals and not finding that real killer moment to open up the opposition.\"\n\nDyche reiterated that the only way out of their current predicament is by \"doing the work, doing the hard yards on the training pitch, putting them into practice\", stressing that it is \"always a work in progress\".\n\nOn facing Aston Villa: \"He's [Unai Emery] done a great job as a manager there. Their recruitment has been good - spent a lot of money, to be fair, on some very good players and they've moulded it into a good unit, so certainly a tough game.\"\n\nDyche added: \"We've just shown lately, we've taken on some of the bigger teams, or the ones that are fancied every year, and done very well against them - and a couple of teams maybe not as fancied, we haven't done as well against them. That's probably the challenge of the group - rising to the expectation of each game rather than just big games\".",

    "description": "Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca could leave his post before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester City.",
    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca could leave his post before Sunday's match against Manchester City, with relations between the Italian and the club's hierarchy having deteriorated.\n\nThe Blues have won just once in their past seven Premier League matches and sit fifth in the table - 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal.\n\nAfter their most recent game - a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on 30 December - assistant manager Willy Caballero said Maresca felt too unwell to speak to the media, but it is understood his absence was more due to him considering his next steps.\n\nThere are reports of a board meeting on New Year's Day to address the situation.\n\nThough they have fallen off the pace in the league, Chelsea have reached the Carabao Cup semi-finals, are preparing to restart their Champions League campaign and will face Charlton in the FA Cup third round.\n\nAt the end of November, Chelsea appeared in a harmonious place, with the team third in the Premier League and having recently dismantled Barcelona in the Champions League.\n\nJust one league win followed in December but it is not just results that added to the focus on Maresca, with fissures emerging between the Italian and the club's hierarchy.\n\nMaresca stunned key figures at the club - and even his own staff - when, after beating Everton 2-0 for Chelsea's solitary Premier League win in December, he said \"many people\" had made it his \"worst 48 hours\" since joining the club.\n\nThose comments came from a position of strength after a good performance but were viewed dimly by the club hierarchy, at whom they appeared to be aimed.\n\nDespite that, the plan remained to conduct an end-of-season review to decide whether to move forward with Maresca or part company.\n\nThose with knowledge of Maresca's views, though, said he was capable of walking away having grown unhappy at a multitude of factors, including encouragement to pick certain players, and a lack of protection from the club about the quality of his work.\n\nAll of which has made for an unsettling situation, with Chelsea - whose players will return to work on Friday - closer in points to 15th place than third in the Premier League.\n\nThey next face Manchester City to start a difficult month that also includes games against Arsenal and Napoli.\n\nAnd it is possible - before that potentially definining period - that Maresca will not be in charge.\n\nChelsea's primary goal this season is to qualify for the Champions League, which remains realistic, while also aiming for domestic cup runs.\n\nChelsea were satisfied with Maresca at the end of last season when he delivered Champions League qualification - regarded internally as his most important achievement - plus success in the Conference League and Club World Cup.\n\nWhile victory in Europe's third-tier competition was broadly expected, beating Paris St-Germain to be crowned 'world champions' was a welcome surprise.\n\nMaresca had delighted key figures at Stamford Bridge - including sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Lawrence Stewart, and influential co-owner Behdad Eghbali.\n\nIn line with the agreed strategy when the Italian moved from Leicester City in 2024 - for which the club paid £10m - he focused on coaching the team while those above him oversaw much of the backroom staff, medical department and transfers.\n\nTheir transfer policy - signing the world's best young players from 'lesser' leagues to create the youngest team in the Premier League - remains in place.\n\nMaresca knew what he was signing up for - and his issues are not about the quality of players or the strategy, but about the perception of his work with a young group.\n\nThe Italian is encouraged to rotate his squad, but often feels that when he does so in the Premier League, they drop points. He has also openly urged reporters to question the club's hierarchy.\n\nThose familiar with his thinking say he has defended his work because he believes he is performing better than many have acknowledged, given the squad's age. He also feels the club should have offered him stronger protection from criticism.\n\nMaresca also wanted to take on some external engagements following the club's recent successes. He had floated the idea of publishing a book but was blocked by the club, and spoke at Il Festival dello Sport - an event in Italy organised by La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper - without their permission.\n\nHe also made public that he disagreed with the club not signing a central defender after Levi Colwill injured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season. The club's hierarchy explained that doing so could prompt academy prospect Josh Acheampong to request a transfer, which ultimately led Maresca to back down.\n\nThose close to Maresca, who has switched agents from the Wasserman agency to Jorge Mendes, say he is weighing up his future. He has been mooted as a potential successor to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, which Maresca described as \"100% speculation\".\n\nIn addition, he has increasingly avoided wearing club tracksuits, opting instead for his own clothing.\n\nChelsea face a packed January schedule across four competitions.\n\nThey begin with Sunday's Premier League trip to the Etihad, with a series of London derbies - home and away - against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Brentford, and West Ham before the end of the month.\n\nIn addition, they have an FA Cup third-round tie away to Charlton, a Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal, and two Champions League fixtures - at home to Pafos and away to Napoli.\n\nChelsea realistically need to win both European games to avoid the play-off round and secure a top-eight finish in the league phase.\n\nThe fifth place they occupy in the Premier League may be enough to secure a return to the Champions League for the 2026-27 season.\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Apparently all it takes to win in the Premier League is playing away from home.",
    "fullText": "Winning ugly is better than not winning at all, and apparently Tottenham Hotspur has found the right formula to squeak out three points. After the blip against Forest, Spurs got the needed result against Palace last weekend — away from home, of course — and can start off the new year right with a similar effort at Thomas Frank’s old stomping grounds. Despite plenty of struggles this fall, Tottenham entered this matchweek just four points off fifth.\n\nOne point above Frank’s new side is his previous squad. Since falling to Spurs in North London less than a month ago, Brentford has taken seven points in three matches and surged up the table. Some of this is due to quality of competition, but Tottenham is in no place to scoff at taking the “easy” points. This is going to be a true test on New Year’s but at least there is some reason to believe.\n\nDate: Thursday, January 1\nTime: 3:00 pm ET, 8:00 pm UK\nLocation: Gtech Community Stadium, Brentford\nTV: NBCSN/Peacock (US), Sky Sports Premier League (UK)\nTable: Brentford (t-9th, 26 pts), Spurs (t-13th, 25 pts)\n\nEven with it happening at home, last month’s win over Brentford was Tottenham’s best league performance in a long time. The 2.2-0.2 xG line was certainly the most dominant this campaign, and those figures were completely justified given how the match played out. That win did make it four straight for Spurs in this fixture, regardless of which club Frank is leading.\n\nNo midweek matches the past two weeks gave Frank a chance to deploy all his resources, possibly revealing his preferred choices. Two players stand out as being on either side of the cusp right now. The first is Archie Gray, who has started seven of the last eight fixtures and nabbed his first career goal over the weekend.\n\nSpurs could certainly use an upgrade in central midfield, but if the personnel remains the same, it sure looks like Gray has broken into the Rodrigo Bentancur-Joao Palhinha double pivot, and rightfully so. Gray played well against Brentford last time and would relish the chance to repeat that performance. Keith Andrews has dabbled with his formations since that meeting, but Gray is a strong choice against any midfield combination.\n\nUp top, Richarlison has been the primary Tottenham striker all season, but more so out of necessity than performance. He does now lead the team in goals and could have had two more at Selhurst Park, but he has not exactly sealed up the job. Though a striker signing is unlikely in January, the impending return of Dominic Solanke could push him to the bench; the Brazilian’s chances to hang on to the starting spot are quickly dwindling.\n\nThat 2-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was just about everything Frank could have asked for against his former club. Spurs were surprisingly direct, aided by a start from Xavi Simons and a quality outing from Mohammed Kudus, with both working well in front of Gray and Bentancur. Brentford had nearly equal possession of the ball but generated just one shot on target, rarely threatening the Tottenham defense.\n\nBrentford will obviously look to adjust from this loss — and has looked pretty good since then — while Spurs will try to anticipate some of these changes. Frank should have the advantage, knowing his previous outfit well, though execution plays just as large of a role as tactics. Tottenham’s win over Palace was no masterclass, but the ability to grind out wins on the road should not be overlooked.\n\nI would expect the Bees to really go for this one. With six goals scored and just one conceded the past two weeks, confidence is high in Brentford. Spurs will need to absorb some pressure while also making the most of their chances (especially the aforementioned Richarlison). This does not feel like another 1-0 contest, so maybe Tottenham can take advantage of the home side’s surge in form and ambition, carrying forward last month’s success.",

    "fullText": "Is that it, then? Was Aston Villa's Premier League title run a three-week wonder, a fantasy bookended by two games against Arsenal?\n\nPerhaps. But it doesn't matter. It is too early to tell for sure - and let me nod to David Michael's complaint on this page on Wednesday, suggesting all talk of titles is too early at this stage anyway. Unai Emery himself would no doubt also endorse that view.\n\nSo, let's qualify it a little and say Villa were being spoken of as contenders to Arsenal and Manchester City on account of having shown not only their ability to beat both those sides, but also to string together victories when playing well and when they weren't. Perhaps the title chatter is better viewed as a tacit acknowledgement that Villa may be ready to break out of the upper-middle group of Premier League clubs and bridge across to the top bracket.\n\nThe most significant factor holding them back may be squad depth, and there was evidence of this at Emirates Stadium.\n\nFor Arsenal, Gabriel scored on his first start for seven weeks and Gabriel Jesus built up his return from injury with his first goal in almost a year. In contrast, while Villa have handled injuries to Pau Torres and Tyrone Mings well enough, suspensions for Matty Cash and Boubacar Kamara pulled more players away from their ideal positions. Amadou Onana's tight hamstring at half-time stretched the elastic a little too far.\n\nEven though the final result was conclusive, Villa had made Arsenal fret in the first 45 minutes. One sharper finish might have given Villa a half-time lead and changed the character of the match decisively.\n\nBut all is not lost. Far from it.\n\nSaturday's game against Nottingham Forest will tell us more about whether Villa have been knocked far off balance by the second half at the Emirates. A confident showing in that game would confirm they are still capable of chasing the leaders hard in the second part of the season.\n\nThe longer-term view is more important, however. Villa start the new year third in the Premier League and well placed to reach the knockout stage of the Europa League. Their objectives for the campaign are clearly within range.\n\nVilla have begun each previous new year under Emery well positioned to take the club further forward, and the same is true at the dawn of 2026.\n\nListen to full commentary of Aston Villa v Nottingham Forest at 12:30 GMT on Saturday on BBC Radio WM (95.6FM/DAB/Freeview 714)\n\nExplore Aston Villa content on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "As 2026 begins, the wait for a verdict on the Premier League’s charges against Manchester, or the ‘115‘ as they are commonly known, continues. The independent panel which heard the case is yet to deliver its verdict on the affair. The best word to sum up the entire process is frustrating. It is a subject that has rumbled away in the background to matters on the pitch for far too long. Speaking yesterday ahead of Manchester City’s upcoming Premier League fixture against Sunderland, Pep Guardiola shared his frustration with the wait for a verdict on the matter to be delivered. Pep Guardiola’s assessment sums the entire matter up for me. It is now a topic that has drifted away as time goes on.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, ahead of Manchester City’s clash with Sunderland, Pep Guardiola shared his frustration with the wait for a verdict in Manchester City’s case. City is charged with breaching the Premier League’s financial regulations over a prolonged period of time. When asked about the wait, in quotes relayed by Manchester Evening News, Pep Guardiola said: “It’s the same question I ask you, so I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe you have better info than me. You don’t have?”\n\n“I would love to have it, but I don’t know. I don’t know. The same answer to your question is the same you answered me one, two, three years ago. So they must be so busy.”\n\nWho knows when the verdict on the ‘115’ will arrive. There has been constant speculation that a verdict is ‘imminent’ for some time now. But as we enter 2026 the wait for the verdict continues. Pep Guardiola summed it up best when he shared his frustration with the wait. That is the feelings of many on the topic.\n\nUntil the ‘115’ verdict arrives it is wasted energy for me. I’d rather focus on matters on the pitch, in the transfer market and any other matter that surrounds Manchester City. The ‘115’ has dragged on for too long and frankly it is a matter that has drifted out of view for now. When a verdict arrives, that will thrust the topic back into the spotlight. When that will be, no one knows but Pep Guardiola’s assessment on the matter is on money.",

    "fullText": "From the moment reports broke that RC Lens were close to signing Samson Baidoo from Red Bull Salzburg in the summer, a very obvious comparison awaited the Austrian international. As a centre-back capable of playing in the middle of a back three, it was hard to ignore the idea that Lens had found their successor to Kevin Danso, who had left midway through last season for Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLens had tried hard to keep their interest in Baidoo a secret for as long as possible. They had to work quickly and quietly or else they would lose momentum, as the 21-year-old was on the radars of far richer clubs in the Premier League, but they had not yet been stirred into action. As soon as news leaked that Lens had made contact, they knew that these clubs would have bids readied. And that is exactly what is reported to have happened.\n\nL’Équipe wrote that two Premier League clubs sent delegations to try to swoop for Baidoo. They offered a far more lucrative deal to the club and the player, but it was too late. Lens had, in stealth, laid out the groundwork in a reported €8m deal and provided a convincing case for why the Austrian should continue his progress in France. A case that was helped by their former player.\n\nBaidoo would tell the French outlet that Danso had spoken to him before the move, telling him, “That if I want to focus solely on football, [Lens] is the place to be. He’s changed here as a person, as a player. He’s given me a lot of confidence.” It’s a decision that has worked out perfectly for the young defender; he has put in a star turn in a team that has climbed to first in the league on the back of their unflinching defensive performances.\n\nThis is all the more impressive when considering that this is a Lens side that had its defence decimated over the past two transfer windows, with the sales and departures of the likes of Danso, Abdukodir Khusanov, and Facundo Medina. Baidoo has helped make the memory of those players a distant one, and it is becoming increasingly obvious that when he eventually leaves the north of France, it will be for far more than they originally signed him for.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool haven’t been able to reach the exceptional level they did last season, when Arne Slot won the Premier League at the first time of asking.\n\nA number of issues have compounded to make life hard for the Reds this season, some down to bad luck and some down to decision making.\n\nThe result was Liverpool’s worst run of form in recent memory during October and November, during which the Reds lost nine of 12 matches in all competitions, including back-to-back 3-0 defeats to Man City and Nottingham Forest.\n\nSlot’s side seem to have recovered slightly, winning four on the bounce and remaining unbeaten in seven, but one key problem persists – Liverpool seemingly cannot defend set pieces.\n\nThe Reds’ defending has been questionable this season, but their biggest problems have come when defending set pieces.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nIf you include penalties, over half of the goals Liverpool have conceded in the Premier League this season have come from set pieces. When penalties aren’t included, Slot’s side have conceded more set piece goals than any other side in the competition.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Liverpool are averaging 8.2 goals conceded per 100 set pieces taken this season.\n\nThere will obviously be a number of factors contributing to the Reds’ vulnerability to set pieces, but more often than not they are conceding in the same manner.\n\nLiverpool aren’t conceding standard set piece goals, where the ball is played into the box and finished first time, they are instead conceding in the second phase of set pieces.\n\nThe Reds generally have little problem winning the first contact after a set piece, but they struggle massively to deal with what comes next.\n\nSlot is obviously aware of his side’s apparent inability to defend set pieces, but the Dutchman doesn’t believe his set up is the problem.\n\n“For me, it’s not the setup, because it’s the same setup as we had last season, where we hardly conceded,” Slot said, via The Athletic.\n\n“In this setup, there are a lot of similar players that are mainly important. So, tell me what it is. If I tell you now it’s bad luck, then you will probably say that’s a bit too much after 15 games.”\n\nAndy Jones, writing for The Athletic, points out that Slot may have a point. Liverpool’s expected goals conceded per 100 set pieces is only 4.0, half the number that they are actually conceding.\n\nThe fact they are conceding at such a dramatic rate over their expected goals conceded may be down to bad luck, but Liverpool must improve in the second phase.\n\nA change in system seems to have sparked the Reds current revival, with chance creation and goal scoring now not seeming as big an issue as they were in the depths of Liverpool’s bad run.\n\nThe Premier League champions are far from back to their best though, and shoring up their defence must be the next step.\n\nWorking specifically on the second phase of defending set pieces must be a priority, if Liverpool can eliminate conceding from this situation they will undoubtedly take a big step in the right direction.\n\nIf Liverpool can resolve their second phase issue, there is still plenty of time left this season for them to turn it around and enjoy a successful campaign.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal secured another three points to remain top of the Premier League table with a win over Brighton and Hove Albion at the weekend, so it’s no surprise a few of their players were selected for the various Teams of the Week.\n\nAlan Shearer included both David Raya and Martin Odegaard in his Team of the Week on behalf of the Premier League website.\n\nShearer praised Raya for a “contender for Save of the Season to deny Yankuba Minteh”, and added that Odegaard “looked back to his very best” as he “led by example”.\n\nAlan Shearer’s Premier League Team of the Week for Matchweek 18\n\nTroy Deeney didn’t select Raya and Odegaard for his BBC Team of the Week, but he did still find a spot for an Arsenal player in Declan Rice.\n\nRice was used out of position at right-back for the Brighton game, but he put in a good display all the same.\n\nDeeney wrote that despite the position change, Rice “was still massively influential, marauding forward and defensively he was solid”. He added that the midfielder “never had anyone at Brighton get at him” and “just handled every situation well”.\n\nTroy Deeney’s BBC Team of the Week for Matchweek 18\n\nThe schedule is so packed at the moment that there’s barely time for the Premier League and the BBC to put out one Team of the Week because the next round of fixtures gets underway. Arsenal will be back in action against Aston Villa on Tuesday night.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have parted ways with first-team set-piece coach Aaron Briggs as the Premier League champions move to address a persistent weakness that has undermined their performances this season.\n\nThe decision follows mounting frustration inside the club over Liverpool’s record at dead-ball situations, which has been among the poorest in the division despite their continued strength in open play.\n\nSet pieces have proven costly for Arne Slot’s side, with Liverpool conceding 12 goals from such situations in the Premier League, more than any other top-flight team when penalties are excluded.\n\nOnly West Ham United have conceded more goals from corners, while Liverpool have allowed seven from that specific source alone.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch, their returns have been similarly underwhelming, with Liverpool scoring just 2.4 goals per 100 set pieces, a figure bettered only by Brentford from the wrong end of the scale.\n\nIn terms of defensive output, Liverpool are conceding 8.2 goals per 100 set pieces, with only Nottingham Forest posting a worse average.\n\nThose issues have repeatedly altered the course of matches, most recently against Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, when Liverpool led comfortably before conceding from set pieces and being forced into tense finishes.\n\nBriggs joined Liverpool’s coaching staff in July 2024, initially as an individual development coach following the departure of Vitor Matos, before assuming responsibility for set pieces after the club were unable to appoint a specialist.\n\nThe appointment was adjusted last summer when Brazilian coach Luiz Fernando Iubel arrived as individual lead coach, allowing Briggs to focus solely on dead-ball situations, but the changes failed to produce the desired improvement.\n\nDespite his reputation as a diligent and respected coach, Liverpool concluded that a change was required midway through the campaign, although the club do not view his departure as a complete solution to the problem.\n\nThere is no immediate replacement lined up, with Briggs’ duties set to be shared among existing members of Slot’s coaching staff in the short term.\n\nBriggs arrived at Anfield after working under Niko Kovac at Wolfsburg and previously held senior analytical and coaching roles at Monaco.\n\nHe also spent nine years at Manchester City, progressing from under-18 performance analyst to a senior first-team role, with earlier experience at Blackpool and Preston North End.",

    "fullText": "Something has to might come to an end on Tuesday (2:30 pm ET) — Chelsea's run of just one win in six Premier League games, or Bournemouth's nine-game winless slide — when the two sides meet at Stamford Bridge to close out 2025.\n\nJust as they did last season, Chelsea (5th place - 29 points) entered into the PL title race for all of a handful of days before falling into a downward spiral that ended their chase just as quickly as it began. The Blues sat 2nd in the table after 12 games, six points off leaders Arsenal. Six games (and just one win) later, and the gap is 13. Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa was a heavy blow for Enzo Maresca's side, after they flat out dominated the game in the first half (10-0 shots, 1.97-0.00 xG) before a shocking role reversal after the break.\n\nIf confidence is low for the hosts, where must it be for Andoni Iraola's side? Speaking of sides that went 2nd in the table before the wheels fell off, Bournemouth (15th - 22 points) were four points back of Arsenal after nine games but after taking just four points from the next nine, they are now 20 points adrift and seem set to lose star attacker Antoine Semenyo during the January transfer window. Semenyo has a release clause in his contract that expires early in the month and Manchester City are keen to wrap up the deal quickly.\n\nFor live updates and highlights throughout Chelsea vs Bournemouth, check out PST's live blog coverage below.\n\nKick off time: 2:30 pm ET, Tuesday\nVenue: Stamford Bridge\nTV Channel: USA\nStreaming: Stream live on NBC.com\n\nOUT: Romeo Lavia (thigh), Dario Essugo (thigh), Levi Colwill (torn ACL - MORE), Mykhailo Mudryk (suspension) | QUESTIONABLE: Marc Cucurella (thigh), Jorrel Hato (undisclosed)\n\nOUT: Tyler Adams (knee - MORE), Veljko Milosavljevic (knee), Ben Gannon-Doak (hamstring), Matai Akinmboni (muscular) | QUESTIONABLE: Antoine Semenyo (undisclosed), Alex Scott (jaw)\n\nExactly what Chelsea need — a comfortable win thanks to their considerable attacking talent.

    "description": "“I hope that having sampled Premier League football for the first time, he’s hungry for more and determined to push on”.",
    "fullText": "As the years have passed and Sunderland’s squad has been revamped, refitted and reshaped, many of the architects of those memorable seasons and moments that preceded our return to the Premier League; of League One playoff success, the freewheeling “play it your way, lads” Tony Mowbray era and to an extent our landmark 2024/2025 season under Régis Le Bris have gradually moved on.\n\nFrom Corry Evans and Danny Batth to Ross Stewart and Bailey Wright; from Elliot Embleton and Patrick Roberts to Alex Pritchard and Jack Clarke, many if not all of the lads who played key roles under the likes of Alex Neil, Mowbray and Le Bris have left for pastures new.\n\nOf course, their legacies at Sunderland were secured in their own time but whether as a result of financial necessity, squad development or career progression, most of the players who created unforgettable moments at Hillsborough, the Hawthorns, the Madjeski Stadium and Wembley are long gone.\n\nHowever, one of them is still here and still proudly wearing the red and white stripes, and on Sunday, Dennis Cirkin finally earned the right to call himself a Premier League starter as he slotted in at left back for Sunderland’s clash with Leeds United.\n\nLike Luke O’Nien before him and after a Sunderland career that’s already encompassed League One playoff success and several promising campaigns in the Championship (including that goal against West Bromwich Albion), this felt like a landmark moment for the former Tottenham prospect — it was most definitely an opportunity earned and not given as a token gesture.\n\nFor me, as well as you’d expect for a player who’s battled back from long-term injury, has seen limited game time as a result and was therefore somewhat out of sync with Sunderland’s go-to system, the demands it places on our full backs and the frantic nature of Premier League football. In other words, he was fine.\n\nAgainst the visitors — who were good value for a point and showed the kind of purpose and determination that the likes of Newcastle United lacked — Cirkin showed flashes of energy and attacking intent but was also understandably rusty and was caught cold during the build up to Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s equaliser. That said, it certainly wasn’t a poor performance by any reasonable standard and I suspect he might’ve felt a quiet sense of satisfaction at how things went.\n\nWas this a surprise? Were we expecting miracles on his first top flight start? I think not, and it was to his credit that as a frenetic and occasionally scrappy game unfolded, Cirkin — much like Chris Rigg — didn’t shirk and didn’t hide.\n\nOnly the cynical, the bitter or the downright hard-hearted would begrudge Cirkin this opportunity.\n\nYes, his inclusion in Sunderland’s starting eleven against Daniel Farke’s men was borne of necessity, with first choice Reinildo and Arthur Masuaku both currently on AFCON duty, but at the same time, why would the club invest so much time and energy into Cirkin’s development if they didn’t believe he was capable of eventually making the step up?\n\nThe brilliant Mozambican is our first choice by some distance, but as the Christmas schedule takes its toll and players are brought in from the fringes, the onus is on the likes of Cirkin to show that they can play a role and offer Le Bris the kind of depth that he needs. With increased game time should come greater confidence and if he can get up to speed with the demands of top flight football, I can see him doing a sterling job until Reinildo returns from Morocco and is ready to go again.\n\nI’m unashamedly banging this particular drum for one simple reason: I like Cirkin as a footballer and I always have — not least because at his best in the Championship, he was one of the most dynamic and potent attack-minded full backs on the scene.\n\nFrom afar, he strikes me as something of a complex character; a player who perhaps has something of a difficult and fractious relationship with football, and it’s fair to say that he’s often endured torrid misfortune with injuries during his time at Sunderland.\n\nHowever, his ability is clear to see. He’s as deserving of a crack at top flight football as anyone and the fact that as of right now, he hasn’t put pen to paper on a new contract at Sunderland shouldn’t diminish his standing in the eyes of our fans.\n\nAs he seeks to prove that he can cut it at this level, what Le Bris and his coaching staff will almost certainly want to see from the likes of Cirkin is the kind of team-first attitude that’s propelled Sunderland along all season — and this was by no means a bad place to start.\n\nHe can play better and hopefully he will, and I hope that having sampled Premier League football for the first time, he’s hungry for more and determined to push on — starting against Manchester City later this week.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea host Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, knowing a win would provide a timely lift before the curtain falls on 2025.\n\nThe Blues are heading into this must-win contest after a frustrating 2-1 defeat against Aston Villa.\n\nEnzo Maresca’s side dominated the opening proceedings with Joao Pedro giving Chelsea the lead in the 37th minute after steering home a dangerous Reece James free kick.\n\nChelsea restricted Villa from having the ball and made sure Unai Emery’s troops went into the break without recording a single shot.\n\nFor an hour, the Blues were in cruise control until Ollie Watkins entered the fray and helped Villa turn the game on its head.\n\nChelsea capitulated in front of their own fans as Watkins bagged a brace to end the Blues’ four-match unbeaten home run.\n\nThat defeat saw Chelsea slip to fifth in the table, three points behind Liverpool and only ahead of Manchester United on goal difference.\n\nMaresca will be uneasy that his side have now won just once in their last five league outings (D2, L2) – a run that includes a goalless draw away to Bournemouth earlier this month.\n\nChelsea will take some confidence from the fact that they’ve won two of their last three home games against the Cherries, although James’ late free kick spared their blushes in the most recent 2-2 draw.\n\nHowever, the Blues tend to fare well when they wrap up the year on home turf, losing just one of their last 22 such games (W13, D8).\n\nThe wheels began to come off for Chelsea when Maresca made a handful of second-half changes that allowed Villa back into the game.\n\nThey were untouchable for an hour, so Maresca will likely stick to the same XI, although there could be a minor tweak due to fitness concerns.\n\nRobert Sanchez is guaranteed to start in goal. Wesley Fofana could return to the XI to partner Trevoh Chalobah.\n\nMalo Gusto could also come in for James, who put in an 8/10 performance in the Villa defeat.\n\nMaresca may opt to rest James from the start while Marc Cucurella retains his spot at left back.\n\nMoises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez should continue to anchor the midfield while Pedro Neto, Cole Palmer, and Alejandro Garnacho form the supporting cast behind striker Joao Pedro.",

Whichever way you look at it, it's a foul.\"\n\nThe VAR checked the goal but allowed Jones' on-field decision to stand. Defeat left Forest five points above the Premier League's relegation zone.\n\nThe PGMOL has previously played audio privately to clubs - including Forest - while PGMOL chief refereeing officer Howard Webb also discusses incidents on the Mic'd Up programme.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are planning a midfield revamp come next summer, and they have identified three top-class Premier League midfielders to replace their ageing stars.\n\nCasemiro, despite his resurgence, no longer has the legs to complete 90 minutes in the English top-flight every gameweek.\n\nAnd despite his impressive showing against Newcastle, Manuel Ugarte remains a disappointing signing, with INEOS looking to move him on at the earliest opportunity.\n\nSkipper Bruno Fernandes remains the club’s best player, but the co-owners might look to sell him like last summer. Kobbie Mainoo has failed to impress the head coach.\n\nWhether all three depart or not remains to be seen, but the Red Devils have identified the likes of Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton, and Elliot Anderson as potential replacements.\n\nThe Crystal Palace star’s game-reading skills and ability to dictate play from deep reminds many of United legend Michael Carrick, and he would be a huge asset to have.\n\nHowever, his impressive form has seen many teams enter the race, including Spanish giants Real Madrid.\n\nPalace have made it clear that they are open to a sale should they receive a significant offer.\n\nAnd now, Teamtalk have revealed that Tottenham Hotspur are prepared to break the bank to land the England international.\n\n“Tottenham Hotspur are interested in stepping up their pursuit of Adam Wharton in 2026, with sources indicating the club would be prepared to make a very significant offer for the midfielder.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“Spurs initially explored a move for Wharton in the previous transfer window, but Crystal Palace made it clear they were completely unwilling to entertain any approaches at a time when Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid were also monitoring him.\n\n“Since then, competition for Wharton has only intensified, and Tottenham know they will need to act quickly and decisively if they are to win the race for his signature.”\n\nThe 21-year-old has indicated that he will only move to a club which can offer him Champions League football.\n\nThat means Spurs, who are currently 11th, might struggle to offer him the same unless their on-pitch performances improve drastically.\n\nOn the other hand, Amorim’s men are sixth, only three points away from fourth place. A push in the second half of the season could propel the Old Trafford side back to Europe’s top-tier club competition. Thereby, increasing their chances of landing Adam Wharton.\n\nFeature image Eddie Keogh via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nSenne Lammens (Manchester United): I was going to put David Raya in but I thought one good save doesn't get you in the Team of the Week - the bar is higher than that. He made four or five good saves against Newcastle, conducted his box well and has given Manchester United a platform and base to build off - which they've never had. All that for £18m, not bad at all.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): I obviously worked the game between Arsenal and Brighton at the weekend and Declan Rice filled in at right-back. He was still massively influential, marauding forward and defensively he was solid. He never had anyone at Brighton get at him. He just handled every situation well.\n\nArchie Gray (Tottenham): This one is a little bit dodgy, but I'm putting him in the team anyway. I'm aware he played in midfield against Crystal Palace but the reason I'm putting him there is because I felt like he needed to get in the team. Simply put: he got the winner and he's done every single thing that Spurs have asked of him - played left-back, played right-back, played right wing. You name it, he's done it all. I think he goes in for that situation\n\nKevin Danso (Tottenham): He was going to Wolves at one point but Spurs swooped in and signed him. I think he was meant to be a squad player but every time he steps in, he's fantastic. He doesn't do anything wrong. He just delivers on what he's supposed to do.\n\nLisandro Martinez (Manchester United): He's only 5ft7, 5ft8 and he had Nick Woltemade in his back pocket all day. It was really good to see him back playing after his massive injury. Him being back fit is monumental, not only for him but his World Cup aspirations as well.\n\nRyan Gravenberch (Liverpool): His influence is very simple: if he plays well, Liverpool play well. Obviously he got a goal against a Wolves team that they had to break down, nice finish. You don't really get that much credit for scoring against Wolves if I'm being totally honest, but he was very instrumental.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): Probably his best game since the first game of the season against Wolves. Not only the goal but his impact on the game. He's starting to show what he did at AC Milan. I really like him as a player.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): Again, he scored against Wolves - who will probably go down as the worst team in Premier League history - but he's growing into it and starting to fill into the shirt. Maybe the absences of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have made players start to play through him - and he's starting to be the player we all believed he could be.\n\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City): For me, he's the best player in world football to watch at the moment. He tries things and he's confident on the ball. Even when he makes mistakes, he doesn't care and tries again. He finished the weekend with a goal and an assist. He's the most exciting footballer to watch at this moment in time, and I say that over Lamine Yamal and everyone else.\n\nKevin Schade (Brentford): If you score a hat-trick, you end up in the Team of the Week. It's as simple as that. I nearly put Keith Andrews as the manager of the week.\n\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): We don't normally put players in who start on the bench. However, we've broken our rules. He had such an impact in the second half against Chelsea that he has to go in.\n\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): Unbelievable result. Eleven wins on the bounce. I thought he not only got it spot-on tactically in the second-half, but his in-game managing and the changes he made - most notably when he brought on Ollie Watkins - showed the level he is currently operating at.\n\nHe outcoached Enzo Maresca, who everyone says is a top coach. I think he just showed the level of where he is truly at as a coach and what he can offer.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "One goal in his first 10 Premier League appearances this season had many questioning whether Dominic Calvert-Lewin's best days were behind him.\n\nBut, only four weeks on, he's the most talked-about striker in England after scoring seven goals in six games.\n\nHis latest goal, in the 1-1 draw against Sunderland, took his tally to eight for the season, making him the leading English scorer in the Premier League this campaign.\n\nThe 28-year-old signed for the Whites on a free transfer in the summer after a nine-year spell with Everton, which ended with a series of injuries hampering his final seasons.\n\nBut the numbers behind his resurgence in Daniel Farke's new counter-attacking 3-5-2 formation are impressive.\n\nHis six-game streak places him in elite company as only the 11th English player to score in six or more consecutive Premier League appearances.\n\nTo put that into perspective, even England captain Harry Kane never managed a run this long - his best stands at two separate five-match streaks.\n\nAnd the only English striker to better Calvert-Lewin in recent memory is Jamie Vardy, who went on an eight-game scoring spree for Leicester City in 2019.\n\nSo could Calvert-Lewin yet force his way into Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the World Cup?",

    "fullText": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be sweating on the fitness of Mason Mount as he prepares for his side’s Premier League match against Wolves on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe former Chelsea man came off at half-time on Sunday in United’s 1-0 win over Newcastle. Amorim said post-match that he was hoping the injury was nothing serious.\n\nIf Mount does make it, an unchanged XI is expected, partly on merit after Sunday but also partly because there are few other options.\n\nHarry Maguire is back on the grass but is unlikely to be ready for action. Matthijs de Ligt and Bruno Fernandes are still injured, and Kobbie Mainoo is also unlikely to have recovered in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Nouss Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are still participating for their countries in AFCON. All three of their nations – Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon (respectively) – are expected to progress to the knockout stages, so they are unlikely to be back until around 10th January or even beyond.\n\nSenne Lammens will continue in goal. Amorim is likely to persist with a back four of Diogo Dalot, Sunday’s Man of the Match Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw.\n\nCasemiro and Manuel Ugarte will once again be the twin sixes. If fit, Mount will play in front of them. Patrick Dorgu was excellent on the right wing on Sunday, so is likely to continue there, with Matheus Cunha on the left and Ben Sesko up top.\n\nIf Mount does not make it, he could be replaced directly by Jack Fletcher as he was at half-time against the Magpies. Alternatively, the boss could revert to a back three, bringing in Leny Yoro as a third centre-back and pushing the full-backs up into wing-back roles.\n\nHowever, Amorim has hinted at more than one press conference that he is reluctant to play Shaw at wing-back due to the physical exertion involved.\n\nAnother possibility would be to play 4-2-3-1 with Josh Zirkzee sitting in behind Sesko. Given the opposition’s struggles this season, it would certainly be an option.\n\nGiven all that, here is our predicted XI for Tuesday’s 8.15pm kick-off:\n\nFeatured image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "You started your professional career in Finland, and one spell that stands out is your time at HJK Helsinki. You won the league and the cup there. How important was that period for you?\n\n“It was huge, to be honest. It is important to understand what you want and how you plan to achieve it. Everyone dreams of winning trophies and playing in the Champions League, but there is a process you have to follow.\n\n“When I arrived in Helsinki, people told me it would be difficult because I was not a local player. Through hard work, I secured my place in the starting eleven. We won the league in my first year. The season before, the club had been fighting to stay in the league and even had playoffs to survive.\n\n“I had a clause in my contract that allowed me to leave if they were relegated. They stayed up, we built a new team, and then won the league. The following season, we qualified for the Champions League. It was the first Finnish club to reach the group stage in 1998, and it still is.\n\n“Playing in the Champions League was incredible. You feel nervous at first, but once the anthem plays, the nerves disappear. I won the Players’ Player of the Year and top scorer. I won everything you can win in Finland, and that was the moment to move on.”\n\nYou moved to Stockport County. At first, you were playing regularly, then a change of manager reduced your game time. Despite that, there was still a lot of interest in you. How do you reflect on your time there?\n\n“It was a great time. It was exactly what I needed because moving from Finland to the Championship was a big jump. I was playing every week, and just before the manager left, I had a chance to join Blackburn.\n\n“The manager left on a Sunday, and on Monday, Blackburn called. They were in the Premier League with Graeme Souness as manager. The new manager at Stockport did not let the move happen.\n\n“Before joining Stockport, I had actually been at Wolves for a few days. They had watched me score five goals in two games in Finland and offered me a contract, but my agent messed things up. I went back to Finland, and a week later, Stockport called.\n\n“They told me that if I joined and we stayed up, they would not stand in the way of a move to a bigger club. It was not written down, but that was the agreement. When the Blackburn move did not happen, I was disappointed, but I then moved to Sheffield Wednesday and continued from there.”\n\n“I loved those games. After playing in the Champions League, your confidence and belief grow because you have played at the highest level.\n\n“The derbies were special. I scored in most of them, and I always thought about the fans. Derby matches are for them. Before the season even begins, those are the fixtures everyone looks for.”\n\nYour time at Sheffield Wednesday was successful from a personal perspective and led to you joining Ipswich Town. How do you reflect on your time there overall?\n\n“I loved Sheffield Wednesday. The club is huge, and the supporters are fantastic. But it was the right club at the wrong time for me. They were in a difficult financial position after relegation from the Premier League.\n\n“The move to Ipswich came through Willie Donachie, who had been assistant manager at Sheffield Wednesday. Joe Royle got the job at Ipswich. Willie joined him, and two days later, he called me asking if I wanted to come on loan. That is how it happened.”\n\nAt Ipswich, you played alongside Darren Bent. You were scoring goals and became the club’s leading scorer. What was that spell like?\n\n“Ipswich felt like home. I remember that Willie Donachie picked me up on Saturday morning, the day after everything had been agreed. We drove to Watford to meet the team at the hotel.\n\n“Joe Royle told me I would start on the bench because I had not trained. We were 1–0 down at halftime. A few minutes before the break, I was told to warm up. I came on and scored with my first touch. Jim Magilton scored the second, and we won 2–1. After that, we won seven matches in a row.\n\n“Playing with Darren Bent was like a dream. He was young, fast, skinny, and a great finisher. We scored so many simple goals. I would win the header from a goal kick, and he would run through and score. You could see immediately that he would have a great career.”\n\nYour performances attracted interest from Blackburn, and you got the chance to play in the Premier League. Was that a dream come true?\n\n“Yes, absolutely. I spent two and a half years at Ipswich, and we reached the playoffs twice. In the first season, we lost to West Ham, and in the second season, we missed automatic promotion and lost to West Ham again.\n\n“I always said that if Ipswich had been promoted, I probably would never have left. I had a very strong connection with the club. When my contract was finishing, the chairman, David Sheepshanks, told me that he knew the dream was to play in the Premier League. They could not offer that at the time, but he did not want to stand in my way. He also told me that if I did not sign for a Premier League club, to speak to him first because he was ready to offer something he had never offered before.\n\n“That meant a lot. Leaving was not easy, even to play in the Premier League. But signing for Blackburn was a dream come true.”\n\nWhat was it like working under Mark Hughes, and how do you reflect on your time at Blackburn?\n\n“I think I did well. In my first Premier League season, I scored seven or eight goals and played regularly. We had Craig Bellamy, who was great to play with. He was very quick and worked hard.\n\n“In January, the club signed Sinama Pongolle on loan from Liverpool, and after that, I did not start as many matches. I always felt that if I had continued to play as much as I had before January, I would have reached double figures in goals.\n\n“Mark Hughes was very quiet but very honest. His presence said a lot because of the clubs he had played for. He always said his door was open if you wanted to talk. He did not speak a lot, but when he walked into a room, you felt it.”\n\nWhen you were leaving Blackburn, Gordon Strachan showed strong interest in signing you for Celtic. How close was that deal?\n\n“I think it was close. I was told about the situation, and there was also interest from Everton. Blackburn reached a point where I had to make a decision. Crystal Palace came in as well, and they wanted to get back to the Premier League.\n\n“If everything had fallen into place, I would have gone to Celtic. But you never really know how close a deal is. I have travelled up and down the country many times, thinking something was close. I learned that until a deal is done, it is never close.”\n\nYou joined Crystal Palace when the club was desperate to return to the Premier League, and Simon Jordan was in charge. What was it like playing for Palace?\n\n“Palace had a very good team at the time. The squad was strong, but I think we had too many egos. There were too many players who felt they had to play, and the atmosphere was not right.\n\nIn successful teams, there is banter, togetherness, and a real spirit. I never felt we had that at Palace.\n\n“Peter Taylor was the manager. As a person, he was one of the nicest men you could meet. He was a gentleman who never wanted to upset anyone. Sometimes, though, a manager needs a tougher side. With the big characters in the squad, I felt we lacked that strength from the manager.”\n\nAfter leaving Palace, you moved to Germany to TuS Koblenz and ended up playing alongside your brother. What was that experience like?\n\n“It was something I always dreamed of. I went to Germany because my brother was there. I wanted to play with him before the end of my career.\n\n“He moved to England very young and signed for Birmingham in the Premier League, but he suffered some bad injuries. Technically, he was better than me. He was taller, more skilful, and very talented. Mentally, I was a bit different, and that helped me in my career.\n\n“When he went to the second tier in Germany, I visited him a few times. Eventually, I decided to join him. Playing together was special. Sharing the pitch with your brother is an incredible feeling.”\n\nYou later returned to the UK and worked under Brendan Rodgers at Swansea. What was it like working with him?\n\n“I knew straight away he was going to have a top career. The standards he set were very high. Everything was organised. Even though Swansea did not have the training facilities they have today, everything felt professional and prepared.\n\n“He demanded a lot from himself first. Players see that. Modern players are clever, and they can tell immediately if a manager drops his standards. Brendan never did. His success does not surprise me. I still keep in touch with him, and he is someone I admire.”\n\nWhen you left Swansea, you were in the Championship with a club aiming for the Premier League. Did you expect to return to the Premier League with a team like Newcastle?\n\n“Honestly, no. Not with a club of that size. When I was at Ipswich, Sir Bobby Robson tried to sign me for Newcastle, so I already knew how huge the club was.\n\n“When the call came, it was a great surprise. You see the Newcastle fans on television, standing in the winter with no shirts on, but you only understand it once you go there. The passion is unbelievable. After a few months, I understood exactly why someone like Alan Shearer never left, even when he had offers from top clubs. The connection with the supporters is special.\n\n“Brendan Rodgers told me honestly that I was not in his plans at Swansea. It hurts at first, but honesty helps you move on. We agreed to terminate the contract because the window was closing, and I wanted options. Then Newcastle called. I felt like a ten-year-old kid. I could not wait to drive up there the next morning.”\n\nAfter Newcastle, you had spells at Oldham Athletic and then Hibernian. How do you reflect on those final stages of your career?\n\n“Newcastle helped me find myself again, but I actually think I finished my career a little too early. I always put pressure on myself, and I had already started my coaching badges. I knew I wanted to go into management.\n\n“Paul Dickov, who I played with at Blackburn, brought me to Oldham. He told me I would play every week and that one day there might even be a chance to take over after him. I wanted to experience League One because it would help me understand another level of the game. I had a good time there.\n\n“Then Hibs came in. Pat Fenlon called me every day. I saw the derby against Hearts, and the atmosphere was fantastic. The training ground was excellent. It felt like the right move.\n\n“But Hibs was the most disappointing part of my career. I barely played. I had maybe one or two starts. I had spent my career in the Championship and Premier League, and suddenly I could not get on the pitch. That situation made me decide to retire.\n\n“I have always been honest. If someone is better than me, fine. But sitting on the bench or being left out entirely is not for me. I train all week for Saturday. If I am not involved, then I want to move on. That is why I changed clubs fairly often.”\n\nFinally, Shefki, who were your toughest individual opponents in the Premier League?\n\n“Rio Ferdinand was always incredibly tough. He was not only strong in the air but also extremely quick. Even if he made a mistake, he could recover immediately, which made him very hard to play against.\n\n“John Terry was another one I really enjoyed battling with. He was brave and physical and would put his head where others would not put their feet. That suited my style because I always loved the fight.”",

    "description": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was rewarded for a change in style and formation with a hard-fought win over Newcastle in the Premier League.",
    "fullText": "As a football idealist, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has specific beliefs about how the game should be played - and the best way to win.\n\nBut his usual philosophy was not the one that brought the Christmas present of a 1-0 Premier League win over Newcastle.\n\nFor one thing, there was the formation switch.\n\nAmorim joked in September that not even the Pope could persuade him to change, but for the first time since he took charge 13 months ago, he fielded a back four.\n\nFor another, victory was achieved with 33.4% possession, their lowest in any game this season. It was United's lowest percentage of possession in a victory since the 29.4% they had when beating against Manchester City in January 2023.\n\nThey had nine shots at Old Trafford compared to Newcastle's 16. The visitors had 43 touches in their opponents' box. Amorim's men had 15.\n\nYet it was Manchester United who prevailed, thanks to a combination of Patrick Dorgu's first goal for the club - which was a sublime first-half volley from the edge of the area - and only a second clean sheet of the season.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. But even for Amorim, sometimes there are days when substance trumps style.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unequivocal reply when asked if this was one of the 'most satisfying' wins of his, at times, tortuous 13 months in charge.\n\n\"The feeling is good. If you compared to other games, we suffered so much more today but in certain moments we put everything on the line.\n\n\"We are defending every cross. Especially if you see the second half, sometimes we managed to defend with a back six.\n\n\"We had so many games when we controlled the opponent so much better, but it is a good feeling to have a clean sheet. We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"",

    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta hailed the “incredible” way his Arsenal squad have dealt with continued setbacks this season after beating Brighton 2-1 to go back to the top of the Premier League.\n\nMartin Odegaard put the Gunners in front on 14 minutes before a Georginio Rutter own goal made it two for Arteta’s side.\n\nBut Diego Gomez set up a nervy ending to the game, with Arsenal again managing to secure a narrow win.\n\nArsenal were without Jurrien Timber through injury for the game, while Riccardo Calafiori pulled out of the starting 11 in the warm up.\n\nAnd Arteta praised his Arsenal players for their adaptability, though says the scoreline should have been more comfortable.\n\n“Very happy with the performance, individually and collectively, so dominant, we were a big threat,” he said.\n\n“So very pleased with all of that.\n\n“But the margin should have been much bigger, I mean with the amount of situations, chances, open chances that we generated through the game. It should never be 2-1.\n\n“But that’s the Premier League, that’s the step that we have to make. I think the first shot that they had they scored the goal and then David (Raya) has to make another save to maintain the result.\n\n“But what I like is that we’re having a lot of issues, we’re dealing with it in an incredible way. Yesterday we lost Jurrien, today we lost Calafiori in the warm-up. Declan has to play as a full-back and you see the performance that he put in. So that’s the spirit and that’s how much our players want it.”\n\nOn Calafiori’s injury, Arteta added: “It’s something that he felt yesterday, something very awkward that happened and today in the warm-up he wasn’t comfortable.”\n\nArsenal have again struggled with persistent injury problems this season, and asked how long his side can survive with these problems, Arteta responded: “I don’t know. At the moment we survive six months, so let’s see. It’s another five and a half to go so hopefully things will get better.\n\n“The good news as well, for example, we got Gabi (Gabriel) back earlier than expected, which is great. The medical staff have done an incredible job. The way he pushes himself as well. That’s what we need because we lost one and we got somebody else back.”",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have accumulated the fewest disciplinary points in the league, with 22 points made up entirely of yellow cards, placing them ahead of Manchester City and Leeds United, who both sit on 27 points.\n\nThe figures mark a clear shift from last season, when Arsenal were shown three red cards in their opening eight league matches.\n\nThose dismissals involved Declan Rice, Leandro Trossard and William Saliba, with Rice and Trossard sent off for kicking the ball away and delaying the restart against Brighton & Hove Albion and Manchester City.\n\nThey have not received any red cards so far this season.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Saturday’s home match against Brighton, Arteta said he believes a change in how the laws are being applied has played a role in Arsenal’s improved red card record.\n\n“I think the rules are different now,” he said.\n\n“So, we paid a big price with that (delaying the restart) rule, and hopefully that stays away and we continue to play with 11 players.”\n\nArteta also reflected on Rice’s dismissal at the Emirates Stadium in August last year, admitting the manner of that performance left a lasting impression.\n\n“I remember it very well,” he said. “I was very hacked off in the manner that we played with 10 men. So hopefully it is going to be very different this time.”\n\nAsked about Arsenal’s position at the top of the fair play standings, Arteta said he was unaware of the statistic but welcomed it.\n\n“I didn’t know. That is good, very good.”\n\nArsenal’s record leaves them ahead of several direct rivals, including Manchester United, Aston Villa and Liverpool, while Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea sit at the bottom of the table.",
