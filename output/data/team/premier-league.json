    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca could leave his post before Sunday's match against Manchester City, with relations between the Italian and the club's hierarchy having deteriorated.\n\nThe Blues have won just once in their past seven Premier League matches and sit fifth in the table - 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal.\n\nAfter their most recent game - a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on 30 December - assistant manager Willy Caballero said Maresca felt too unwell to speak to the media, but it is understood his absence was more due to him considering his next steps.\n\nThere are reports of a board meeting on New Year's Day to address the situation.\n\nThough they have fallen off the pace in the league, Chelsea have reached the Carabao Cup semi-finals, are preparing to restart their Champions League campaign and will face Charlton in the FA Cup third round.\n\nAt the end of November, Chelsea appeared in a harmonious place, with the team third in the Premier League and having recently dismantled Barcelona in the Champions League.\n\nJust one league win followed in December but it is not just results that added to the focus on Maresca, with fissures emerging between the Italian and the club's hierarchy.\n\nMaresca stunned key figures at the club - and even his own staff - when, after beating Everton 2-0 for Chelsea's solitary Premier League win in December, he said \"many people\" had made it his \"worst 48 hours\" since joining the club.\n\nThose comments came from a position of strength after a good performance but were viewed dimly by the club hierarchy, at whom they appeared to be aimed.\n\nDespite that, the plan remained to conduct an end-of-season review to decide whether to move forward with Maresca or part company.\n\nThose with knowledge of Maresca's views, though, said he was capable of walking away having grown unhappy at a multitude of factors, including encouragement to pick certain players, and a lack of protection from the club about the quality of his work.\n\nAll of which has made for an unsettling situation, with Chelsea - whose players will return to work on Friday - closer in points to 15th place than third in the Premier League.\n\nThey next face Manchester City to start a difficult month that also includes games against Arsenal and Napoli.\n\nAnd it is possible - before that potentially definining period - that Maresca will not be in charge.\n\nChelsea's primary goal this season is to qualify for the Champions League, which remains realistic, while also aiming for domestic cup runs.\n\nChelsea were satisfied with Maresca at the end of last season when he delivered Champions League qualification - regarded internally as his most important achievement - plus success in the Conference League and Club World Cup.\n\nWhile victory in Europe's third-tier competition was broadly expected, beating Paris St-Germain to be crowned 'world champions' was a welcome surprise.\n\nMaresca had delighted key figures at Stamford Bridge - including sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Lawrence Stewart, and influential co-owner Behdad Eghbali.\n\nIn line with the agreed strategy when the Italian moved from Leicester City in 2024 - for which the club paid £10m - he focused on coaching the team while those above him oversaw much of the backroom staff, medical department and transfers.\n\nTheir transfer policy - signing the world's best young players from 'lesser' leagues to create the youngest team in the Premier League - remains in place.\n\nMaresca knew what he was signing up for - and his issues are not about the quality of players or the strategy, but about the perception of his work with a young group.\n\nThe Italian is encouraged to rotate his squad, but often feels that when he does so in the Premier League, they drop points. He has also openly urged reporters to question the club's hierarchy.\n\nThose familiar with his thinking say he has defended his work because he believes he is performing better than many have acknowledged, given the squad's age. He also feels the club should have offered him stronger protection from criticism.\n\nMaresca also wanted to take on some external engagements following the club's recent successes. He had floated the idea of publishing a book but was blocked by the club, and spoke at Il Festival dello Sport - an event in Italy organised by La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper - without their permission.\n\nHe also made public that he disagreed with the club not signing a central defender after Levi Colwill injured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season. The club's hierarchy explained that doing so could prompt academy prospect Josh Acheampong to request a transfer, which ultimately led Maresca to back down.\n\nThose close to Maresca, who has switched agents from the Wasserman agency to Jorge Mendes, say he is weighing up his future. He has been mooted as a potential successor to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, which Maresca described as \"100% speculation\".\n\nIn addition, he has increasingly avoided wearing club tracksuits, opting instead for his own clothing.\n\nChelsea face a packed January schedule across four competitions.\n\nThey begin with Sunday's Premier League trip to the Etihad, with a series of London derbies - home and away - against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Brentford, and West Ham before the end of the month.\n\nIn addition, they have an FA Cup third-round tie away to Charlton, a Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal, and two Champions League fixtures - at home to Pafos and away to Napoli.\n\nChelsea realistically need to win both European games to avoid the play-off round and secure a top-eight finish in the league phase.\n\nThe fifth place they occupy in the Premier League may be enough to secure a return to the Champions League for the 2026-27 season.\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Apparently all it takes to win in the Premier League is playing away from home.",
    "fullText": "Winning ugly is better than not winning at all, and apparently Tottenham Hotspur has found the right formula to squeak out three points. After the blip against Forest, Spurs got the needed result against Palace last weekend — away from home, of course — and can start off the new year right with a similar effort at Thomas Frank’s old stomping grounds. Despite plenty of struggles this fall, Tottenham entered this matchweek just four points off fifth.\n\nOne point above Frank’s new side is his previous squad. Since falling to Spurs in North London less than a month ago, Brentford has taken seven points in three matches and surged up the table. Some of this is due to quality of competition, but Tottenham is in no place to scoff at taking the “easy” points. This is going to be a true test on New Year’s but at least there is some reason to believe.\n\nDate: Thursday, January 1\nTime: 3:00 pm ET, 8:00 pm UK\nLocation: Gtech Community Stadium, Brentford\nTV: NBCSN/Peacock (US), Sky Sports Premier League (UK)\nTable: Brentford (t-9th, 26 pts), Spurs (t-13th, 25 pts)\n\nEven with it happening at home, last month’s win over Brentford was Tottenham’s best league performance in a long time. The 2.2-0.2 xG line was certainly the most dominant this campaign, and those figures were completely justified given how the match played out. That win did make it four straight for Spurs in this fixture, regardless of which club Frank is leading.\n\nNo midweek matches the past two weeks gave Frank a chance to deploy all his resources, possibly revealing his preferred choices. Two players stand out as being on either side of the cusp right now. The first is Archie Gray, who has started seven of the last eight fixtures and nabbed his first career goal over the weekend.\n\nSpurs could certainly use an upgrade in central midfield, but if the personnel remains the same, it sure looks like Gray has broken into the Rodrigo Bentancur-Joao Palhinha double pivot, and rightfully so. Gray played well against Brentford last time and would relish the chance to repeat that performance. Keith Andrews has dabbled with his formations since that meeting, but Gray is a strong choice against any midfield combination.\n\nUp top, Richarlison has been the primary Tottenham striker all season, but more so out of necessity than performance. He does now lead the team in goals and could have had two more at Selhurst Park, but he has not exactly sealed up the job. Though a striker signing is unlikely in January, the impending return of Dominic Solanke could push him to the bench; the Brazilian’s chances to hang on to the starting spot are quickly dwindling.\n\nThat 2-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was just about everything Frank could have asked for against his former club. Spurs were surprisingly direct, aided by a start from Xavi Simons and a quality outing from Mohammed Kudus, with both working well in front of Gray and Bentancur. Brentford had nearly equal possession of the ball but generated just one shot on target, rarely threatening the Tottenham defense.\n\nBrentford will obviously look to adjust from this loss — and has looked pretty good since then — while Spurs will try to anticipate some of these changes. Frank should have the advantage, knowing his previous outfit well, though execution plays just as large of a role as tactics. Tottenham’s win over Palace was no masterclass, but the ability to grind out wins on the road should not be overlooked.\n\nI would expect the Bees to really go for this one. With six goals scored and just one conceded the past two weeks, confidence is high in Brentford. Spurs will need to absorb some pressure while also making the most of their chances (especially the aforementioned Richarlison). This does not feel like another 1-0 contest, so maybe Tottenham can take advantage of the home side’s surge in form and ambition, carrying forward last month’s success.",

    "fullText": "Is that it, then? Was Aston Villa's Premier League title run a three-week wonder, a fantasy bookended by two games against Arsenal?\n\nPerhaps. But it doesn't matter. It is too early to tell for sure - and let me nod to David Michael's complaint on this page on Wednesday, suggesting all talk of titles is too early at this stage anyway. Unai Emery himself would no doubt also endorse that view.\n\nSo, let's qualify it a little and say Villa were being spoken of as contenders to Arsenal and Manchester City on account of having shown not only their ability to beat both those sides, but also to string together victories when playing well and when they weren't. Perhaps the title chatter is better viewed as a tacit acknowledgement that Villa may be ready to break out of the upper-middle group of Premier League clubs and bridge across to the top bracket.\n\nThe most significant factor holding them back may be squad depth, and there was evidence of this at Emirates Stadium.\n\nFor Arsenal, Gabriel scored on his first start for seven weeks and Gabriel Jesus built up his return from injury with his first goal in almost a year. In contrast, while Villa have handled injuries to Pau Torres and Tyrone Mings well enough, suspensions for Matty Cash and Boubacar Kamara pulled more players away from their ideal positions. Amadou Onana's tight hamstring at half-time stretched the elastic a little too far.\n\nEven though the final result was conclusive, Villa had made Arsenal fret in the first 45 minutes. One sharper finish might have given Villa a half-time lead and changed the character of the match decisively.\n\nBut all is not lost. Far from it.\n\nSaturday's game against Nottingham Forest will tell us more about whether Villa have been knocked far off balance by the second half at the Emirates. A confident showing in that game would confirm they are still capable of chasing the leaders hard in the second part of the season.\n\nThe longer-term view is more important, however. Villa start the new year third in the Premier League and well placed to reach the knockout stage of the Europa League. Their objectives for the campaign are clearly within range.\n\nVilla have begun each previous new year under Emery well positioned to take the club further forward, and the same is true at the dawn of 2026.\n\nListen to full commentary of Aston Villa v Nottingham Forest at 12:30 GMT on Saturday on BBC Radio WM (95.6FM/DAB/Freeview 714)\n\nExplore Aston Villa content on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "As 2026 begins, the wait for a verdict on the Premier League’s charges against Manchester, or the ‘115‘ as they are commonly known, continues. The independent panel which heard the case is yet to deliver its verdict on the affair. The best word to sum up the entire process is frustrating. It is a subject that has rumbled away in the background to matters on the pitch for far too long. Speaking yesterday ahead of Manchester City’s upcoming Premier League fixture against Sunderland, Pep Guardiola shared his frustration with the wait for a verdict on the matter to be delivered. Pep Guardiola’s assessment sums the entire matter up for me. It is now a topic that has drifted away as time goes on.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, ahead of Manchester City’s clash with Sunderland, Pep Guardiola shared his frustration with the wait for a verdict in Manchester City’s case. City is charged with breaching the Premier League’s financial regulations over a prolonged period of time. When asked about the wait, in quotes relayed by Manchester Evening News, Pep Guardiola said: “It’s the same question I ask you, so I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe you have better info than me. You don’t have?”\n\n“I would love to have it, but I don’t know. I don’t know. The same answer to your question is the same you answered me one, two, three years ago. So they must be so busy.”\n\nWho knows when the verdict on the ‘115’ will arrive. There has been constant speculation that a verdict is ‘imminent’ for some time now. But as we enter 2026 the wait for the verdict continues. Pep Guardiola summed it up best when he shared his frustration with the wait. That is the feelings of many on the topic.\n\nUntil the ‘115’ verdict arrives it is wasted energy for me. I’d rather focus on matters on the pitch, in the transfer market and any other matter that surrounds Manchester City. The ‘115’ has dragged on for too long and frankly it is a matter that has drifted out of view for now. When a verdict arrives, that will thrust the topic back into the spotlight. When that will be, no one knows but Pep Guardiola’s assessment on the matter is on money.",

The panel unanimously supported this spot-kick decision.\n\n\"I was half-choking last night when I saw the decision given [to Fulham] and ours wasn't,\" said Moyes. \"It feels as though certain clubs get those decisions and other clubs don't.\"\n\nEach KMI Panel is made up of five members.

    "fullText": "From the moment reports broke that RC Lens were close to signing Samson Baidoo from Red Bull Salzburg in the summer, a very obvious comparison awaited the Austrian international. As a centre-back capable of playing in the middle of a back three, it was hard to ignore the idea that Lens had found their successor to Kevin Danso, who had left midway through last season for Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLens had tried hard to keep their interest in Baidoo a secret for as long as possible. They had to work quickly and quietly or else they would lose momentum, as the 21-year-old was on the radars of far richer clubs in the Premier League, but they had not yet been stirred into action. As soon as news leaked that Lens had made contact, they knew that these clubs would have bids readied. And that is exactly what is reported to have happened.\n\nL’Équipe wrote that two Premier League clubs sent delegations to try to swoop for Baidoo. They offered a far more lucrative deal to the club and the player, but it was too late. Lens had, in stealth, laid out the groundwork in a reported €8m deal and provided a convincing case for why the Austrian should continue his progress in France. A case that was helped by their former player.\n\nBaidoo would tell the French outlet that Danso had spoken to him before the move, telling him, “That if I want to focus solely on football, [Lens] is the place to be. He’s changed here as a person, as a player. He’s given me a lot of confidence.” It’s a decision that has worked out perfectly for the young defender; he has put in a star turn in a team that has climbed to first in the league on the back of their unflinching defensive performances.\n\nThis is all the more impressive when considering that this is a Lens side that had its defence decimated over the past two transfer windows, with the sales and departures of the likes of Danso, Abdukodir Khusanov, and Facundo Medina. Baidoo has helped make the memory of those players a distant one, and it is becoming increasingly obvious that when he eventually leaves the north of France, it will be for far more than they originally signed him for.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool haven’t been able to reach the exceptional level they did last season, when Arne Slot won the Premier League at the first time of asking.\n\nA number of issues have compounded to make life hard for the Reds this season, some down to bad luck and some down to decision making.\n\nThe result was Liverpool’s worst run of form in recent memory during October and November, during which the Reds lost nine of 12 matches in all competitions, including back-to-back 3-0 defeats to Man City and Nottingham Forest.\n\nSlot’s side seem to have recovered slightly, winning four on the bounce and remaining unbeaten in seven, but one key problem persists – Liverpool seemingly cannot defend set pieces.\n\nThe Reds’ defending has been questionable this season, but their biggest problems have come when defending set pieces.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nIf you include penalties, over half of the goals Liverpool have conceded in the Premier League this season have come from set pieces. When penalties aren’t included, Slot’s side have conceded more set piece goals than any other side in the competition.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Liverpool are averaging 8.2 goals conceded per 100 set pieces taken this season.\n\nThere will obviously be a number of factors contributing to the Reds’ vulnerability to set pieces, but more often than not they are conceding in the same manner.\n\nLiverpool aren’t conceding standard set piece goals, where the ball is played into the box and finished first time, they are instead conceding in the second phase of set pieces.\n\nThe Reds generally have little problem winning the first contact after a set piece, but they struggle massively to deal with what comes next.\n\nSlot is obviously aware of his side’s apparent inability to defend set pieces, but the Dutchman doesn’t believe his set up is the problem.\n\n“For me, it’s not the setup, because it’s the same setup as we had last season, where we hardly conceded,” Slot said, via The Athletic.\n\n“In this setup, there are a lot of similar players that are mainly important. So, tell me what it is. If I tell you now it’s bad luck, then you will probably say that’s a bit too much after 15 games.”\n\nAndy Jones, writing for The Athletic, points out that Slot may have a point. Liverpool’s expected goals conceded per 100 set pieces is only 4.0, half the number that they are actually conceding.\n\nThe fact they are conceding at such a dramatic rate over their expected goals conceded may be down to bad luck, but Liverpool must improve in the second phase.\n\nA change in system seems to have sparked the Reds current revival, with chance creation and goal scoring now not seeming as big an issue as they were in the depths of Liverpool’s bad run.\n\nThe Premier League champions are far from back to their best though, and shoring up their defence must be the next step.\n\nWorking specifically on the second phase of defending set pieces must be a priority, if Liverpool can eliminate conceding from this situation they will undoubtedly take a big step in the right direction.\n\nIf Liverpool can resolve their second phase issue, there is still plenty of time left this season for them to turn it around and enjoy a successful campaign.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have parted ways with first-team set-piece coach Aaron Briggs as the Premier League champions move to address a persistent weakness that has undermined their performances this season.\n\nThe decision follows mounting frustration inside the club over Liverpool’s record at dead-ball situations, which has been among the poorest in the division despite their continued strength in open play.\n\nSet pieces have proven costly for Arne Slot’s side, with Liverpool conceding 12 goals from such situations in the Premier League, more than any other top-flight team when penalties are excluded.\n\nOnly West Ham United have conceded more goals from corners, while Liverpool have allowed seven from that specific source alone.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch, their returns have been similarly underwhelming, with Liverpool scoring just 2.4 goals per 100 set pieces, a figure bettered only by Brentford from the wrong end of the scale.\n\nIn terms of defensive output, Liverpool are conceding 8.2 goals per 100 set pieces, with only Nottingham Forest posting a worse average.\n\nThose issues have repeatedly altered the course of matches, most recently against Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, when Liverpool led comfortably before conceding from set pieces and being forced into tense finishes.\n\nBriggs joined Liverpool’s coaching staff in July 2024, initially as an individual development coach following the departure of Vitor Matos, before assuming responsibility for set pieces after the club were unable to appoint a specialist.\n\nThe appointment was adjusted last summer when Brazilian coach Luiz Fernando Iubel arrived as individual lead coach, allowing Briggs to focus solely on dead-ball situations, but the changes failed to produce the desired improvement.\n\nDespite his reputation as a diligent and respected coach, Liverpool concluded that a change was required midway through the campaign, although the club do not view his departure as a complete solution to the problem.\n\nThere is no immediate replacement lined up, with Briggs’ duties set to be shared among existing members of Slot’s coaching staff in the short term.\n\nBriggs arrived at Anfield after working under Niko Kovac at Wolfsburg and previously held senior analytical and coaching roles at Monaco.\n\nHe also spent nine years at Manchester City, progressing from under-18 performance analyst to a senior first-team role, with earlier experience at Blackpool and Preston North End.",

    "fullText": "Something has to might come to an end on Tuesday (2:30 pm ET) — Chelsea's run of just one win in six Premier League games, or Bournemouth's nine-game winless slide — when the two sides meet at Stamford Bridge to close out 2025.\n\nJust as they did last season, Chelsea (5th place - 29 points) entered into the PL title race for all of a handful of days before falling into a downward spiral that ended their chase just as quickly as it began. The Blues sat 2nd in the table after 12 games, six points off leaders Arsenal. Six games (and just one win) later, and the gap is 13. Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa was a heavy blow for Enzo Maresca's side, after they flat out dominated the game in the first half (10-0 shots, 1.97-0.00 xG) before a shocking role reversal after the break.\n\nIf confidence is low for the hosts, where must it be for Andoni Iraola's side? Speaking of sides that went 2nd in the table before the wheels fell off, Bournemouth (15th - 22 points) were four points back of Arsenal after nine games but after taking just four points from the next nine, they are now 20 points adrift and seem set to lose star attacker Antoine Semenyo during the January transfer window. Semenyo has a release clause in his contract that expires early in the month and Manchester City are keen to wrap up the deal quickly.\n\nFor live updates and highlights throughout Chelsea vs Bournemouth, check out PST's live blog coverage below.\n\nKick off time: 2:30 pm ET, Tuesday\nVenue: Stamford Bridge\nTV Channel: USA\nStreaming: Stream live on NBC.com\n\nOUT: Romeo Lavia (thigh), Dario Essugo (thigh), Levi Colwill (torn ACL - MORE), Mykhailo Mudryk (suspension) | QUESTIONABLE: Marc Cucurella (thigh), Jorrel Hato (undisclosed)\n\nOUT: Tyler Adams (knee - MORE), Veljko Milosavljevic (knee), Ben Gannon-Doak (hamstring), Matai Akinmboni (muscular) | QUESTIONABLE: Antoine Semenyo (undisclosed), Alex Scott (jaw)\n\nExactly what Chelsea need — a comfortable win thanks to their considerable attacking talent.

    "description": "“I hope that having sampled Premier League football for the first time, he’s hungry for more and determined to push on”.",
    "fullText": "As the years have passed and Sunderland’s squad has been revamped, refitted and reshaped, many of the architects of those memorable seasons and moments that preceded our return to the Premier League; of League One playoff success, the freewheeling “play it your way, lads” Tony Mowbray era and to an extent our landmark 2024/2025 season under Régis Le Bris have gradually moved on.\n\nFrom Corry Evans and Danny Batth to Ross Stewart and Bailey Wright; from Elliot Embleton and Patrick Roberts to Alex Pritchard and Jack Clarke, many if not all of the lads who played key roles under the likes of Alex Neil, Mowbray and Le Bris have left for pastures new.\n\nOf course, their legacies at Sunderland were secured in their own time but whether as a result of financial necessity, squad development or career progression, most of the players who created unforgettable moments at Hillsborough, the Hawthorns, the Madjeski Stadium and Wembley are long gone.\n\nHowever, one of them is still here and still proudly wearing the red and white stripes, and on Sunday, Dennis Cirkin finally earned the right to call himself a Premier League starter as he slotted in at left back for Sunderland’s clash with Leeds United.\n\nLike Luke O’Nien before him and after a Sunderland career that’s already encompassed League One playoff success and several promising campaigns in the Championship (including that goal against West Bromwich Albion), this felt like a landmark moment for the former Tottenham prospect — it was most definitely an opportunity earned and not given as a token gesture.\n\nFor me, as well as you’d expect for a player who’s battled back from long-term injury, has seen limited game time as a result and was therefore somewhat out of sync with Sunderland’s go-to system, the demands it places on our full backs and the frantic nature of Premier League football. In other words, he was fine.\n\nAgainst the visitors — who were good value for a point and showed the kind of purpose and determination that the likes of Newcastle United lacked — Cirkin showed flashes of energy and attacking intent but was also understandably rusty and was caught cold during the build up to Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s equaliser. That said, it certainly wasn’t a poor performance by any reasonable standard and I suspect he might’ve felt a quiet sense of satisfaction at how things went.\n\nWas this a surprise? Were we expecting miracles on his first top flight start? I think not, and it was to his credit that as a frenetic and occasionally scrappy game unfolded, Cirkin — much like Chris Rigg — didn’t shirk and didn’t hide.\n\nOnly the cynical, the bitter or the downright hard-hearted would begrudge Cirkin this opportunity.\n\nYes, his inclusion in Sunderland’s starting eleven against Daniel Farke’s men was borne of necessity, with first choice Reinildo and Arthur Masuaku both currently on AFCON duty, but at the same time, why would the club invest so much time and energy into Cirkin’s development if they didn’t believe he was capable of eventually making the step up?\n\nThe brilliant Mozambican is our first choice by some distance, but as the Christmas schedule takes its toll and players are brought in from the fringes, the onus is on the likes of Cirkin to show that they can play a role and offer Le Bris the kind of depth that he needs. With increased game time should come greater confidence and if he can get up to speed with the demands of top flight football, I can see him doing a sterling job until Reinildo returns from Morocco and is ready to go again.\n\nI’m unashamedly banging this particular drum for one simple reason: I like Cirkin as a footballer and I always have — not least because at his best in the Championship, he was one of the most dynamic and potent attack-minded full backs on the scene.\n\nFrom afar, he strikes me as something of a complex character; a player who perhaps has something of a difficult and fractious relationship with football, and it’s fair to say that he’s often endured torrid misfortune with injuries during his time at Sunderland.\n\nHowever, his ability is clear to see. He’s as deserving of a crack at top flight football as anyone and the fact that as of right now, he hasn’t put pen to paper on a new contract at Sunderland shouldn’t diminish his standing in the eyes of our fans.\n\nAs he seeks to prove that he can cut it at this level, what Le Bris and his coaching staff will almost certainly want to see from the likes of Cirkin is the kind of team-first attitude that’s propelled Sunderland along all season — and this was by no means a bad place to start.\n\nHe can play better and hopefully he will, and I hope that having sampled Premier League football for the first time, he’s hungry for more and determined to push on — starting against Manchester City later this week.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea host Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, knowing a win would provide a timely lift before the curtain falls on 2025.\n\nThe Blues are heading into this must-win contest after a frustrating 2-1 defeat against Aston Villa.\n\nEnzo Maresca’s side dominated the opening proceedings with Joao Pedro giving Chelsea the lead in the 37th minute after steering home a dangerous Reece James free kick.\n\nChelsea restricted Villa from having the ball and made sure Unai Emery’s troops went into the break without recording a single shot.\n\nFor an hour, the Blues were in cruise control until Ollie Watkins entered the fray and helped Villa turn the game on its head.\n\nChelsea capitulated in front of their own fans as Watkins bagged a brace to end the Blues’ four-match unbeaten home run.\n\nThat defeat saw Chelsea slip to fifth in the table, three points behind Liverpool and only ahead of Manchester United on goal difference.\n\nMaresca will be uneasy that his side have now won just once in their last five league outings (D2, L2) – a run that includes a goalless draw away to Bournemouth earlier this month.\n\nChelsea will take some confidence from the fact that they’ve won two of their last three home games against the Cherries, although James’ late free kick spared their blushes in the most recent 2-2 draw.\n\nHowever, the Blues tend to fare well when they wrap up the year on home turf, losing just one of their last 22 such games (W13, D8).\n\nThe wheels began to come off for Chelsea when Maresca made a handful of second-half changes that allowed Villa back into the game.\n\nThey were untouchable for an hour, so Maresca will likely stick to the same XI, although there could be a minor tweak due to fitness concerns.\n\nRobert Sanchez is guaranteed to start in goal. Wesley Fofana could return to the XI to partner Trevoh Chalobah.\n\nMalo Gusto could also come in for James, who put in an 8/10 performance in the Villa defeat.\n\nMaresca may opt to rest James from the start while Marc Cucurella retains his spot at left back.\n\nMoises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez should continue to anchor the midfield while Pedro Neto, Cole Palmer, and Alejandro Garnacho form the supporting cast behind striker Joao Pedro.",

Whichever way you look at it, it's a foul.\"\n\nThe VAR checked the goal but allowed Jones' on-field decision to stand. Defeat left Forest five points above the Premier League's relegation zone.\n\nThe PGMOL has previously played audio privately to clubs - including Forest - while PGMOL chief refereeing officer Howard Webb also discusses incidents on the Mic'd Up programme.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are planning a midfield revamp come next summer, and they have identified three top-class Premier League midfielders to replace their ageing stars.\n\nCasemiro, despite his resurgence, no longer has the legs to complete 90 minutes in the English top-flight every gameweek.\n\nAnd despite his impressive showing against Newcastle, Manuel Ugarte remains a disappointing signing, with INEOS looking to move him on at the earliest opportunity.\n\nSkipper Bruno Fernandes remains the club’s best player, but the co-owners might look to sell him like last summer. Kobbie Mainoo has failed to impress the head coach.\n\nWhether all three depart or not remains to be seen, but the Red Devils have identified the likes of Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton, and Elliot Anderson as potential replacements.\n\nThe Crystal Palace star’s game-reading skills and ability to dictate play from deep reminds many of United legend Michael Carrick, and he would be a huge asset to have.\n\nHowever, his impressive form has seen many teams enter the race, including Spanish giants Real Madrid.\n\nPalace have made it clear that they are open to a sale should they receive a significant offer.\n\nAnd now, Teamtalk have revealed that Tottenham Hotspur are prepared to break the bank to land the England international.\n\n“Tottenham Hotspur are interested in stepping up their pursuit of Adam Wharton in 2026, with sources indicating the club would be prepared to make a very significant offer for the midfielder.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“Spurs initially explored a move for Wharton in the previous transfer window, but Crystal Palace made it clear they were completely unwilling to entertain any approaches at a time when Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid were also monitoring him.\n\n“Since then, competition for Wharton has only intensified, and Tottenham know they will need to act quickly and decisively if they are to win the race for his signature.”\n\nThe 21-year-old has indicated that he will only move to a club which can offer him Champions League football.\n\nThat means Spurs, who are currently 11th, might struggle to offer him the same unless their on-pitch performances improve drastically.\n\nOn the other hand, Amorim’s men are sixth, only three points away from fourth place. A push in the second half of the season could propel the Old Trafford side back to Europe’s top-tier club competition. Thereby, increasing their chances of landing Adam Wharton.\n\nFeature image Eddie Keogh via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nSenne Lammens (Manchester United): I was going to put David Raya in but I thought one good save doesn't get you in the Team of the Week - the bar is higher than that. He made four or five good saves against Newcastle, conducted his box well and has given Manchester United a platform and base to build off - which they've never had. All that for £18m, not bad at all.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): I obviously worked the game between Arsenal and Brighton at the weekend and Declan Rice filled in at right-back. He was still massively influential, marauding forward and defensively he was solid. He never had anyone at Brighton get at him. He just handled every situation well.\n\nArchie Gray (Tottenham): This one is a little bit dodgy, but I'm putting him in the team anyway. I'm aware he played in midfield against Crystal Palace but the reason I'm putting him there is because I felt like he needed to get in the team. Simply put: he got the winner and he's done every single thing that Spurs have asked of him - played left-back, played right-back, played right wing. You name it, he's done it all. I think he goes in for that situation\n\nKevin Danso (Tottenham): He was going to Wolves at one point but Spurs swooped in and signed him. I think he was meant to be a squad player but every time he steps in, he's fantastic. He doesn't do anything wrong. He just delivers on what he's supposed to do.\n\nLisandro Martinez (Manchester United): He's only 5ft7, 5ft8 and he had Nick Woltemade in his back pocket all day. It was really good to see him back playing after his massive injury. Him being back fit is monumental, not only for him but his World Cup aspirations as well.\n\nRyan Gravenberch (Liverpool): His influence is very simple: if he plays well, Liverpool play well. Obviously he got a goal against a Wolves team that they had to break down, nice finish. You don't really get that much credit for scoring against Wolves if I'm being totally honest, but he was very instrumental.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): Probably his best game since the first game of the season against Wolves. Not only the goal but his impact on the game. He's starting to show what he did at AC Milan. I really like him as a player.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): Again, he scored against Wolves - who will probably go down as the worst team in Premier League history - but he's growing into it and starting to fill into the shirt. Maybe the absences of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have made players start to play through him - and he's starting to be the player we all believed he could be.\n\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City): For me, he's the best player in world football to watch at the moment. He tries things and he's confident on the ball. Even when he makes mistakes, he doesn't care and tries again. He finished the weekend with a goal and an assist. He's the most exciting footballer to watch at this moment in time, and I say that over Lamine Yamal and everyone else.\n\nKevin Schade (Brentford): If you score a hat-trick, you end up in the Team of the Week. It's as simple as that. I nearly put Keith Andrews as the manager of the week.\n\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): We don't normally put players in who start on the bench. However, we've broken our rules. He had such an impact in the second half against Chelsea that he has to go in.\n\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): Unbelievable result. Eleven wins on the bounce. I thought he not only got it spot-on tactically in the second-half, but his in-game managing and the changes he made - most notably when he brought on Ollie Watkins - showed the level he is currently operating at.\n\nHe outcoached Enzo Maresca, who everyone says is a top coach. I think he just showed the level of where he is truly at as a coach and what he can offer.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "One goal in his first 10 Premier League appearances this season had many questioning whether Dominic Calvert-Lewin's best days were behind him.\n\nBut, only four weeks on, he's the most talked-about striker in England after scoring seven goals in six games.\n\nHis latest goal, in the 1-1 draw against Sunderland, took his tally to eight for the season, making him the leading English scorer in the Premier League this campaign.\n\nThe 28-year-old signed for the Whites on a free transfer in the summer after a nine-year spell with Everton, which ended with a series of injuries hampering his final seasons.\n\nBut the numbers behind his resurgence in Daniel Farke's new counter-attacking 3-5-2 formation are impressive.\n\nHis six-game streak places him in elite company as only the 11th English player to score in six or more consecutive Premier League appearances.\n\nTo put that into perspective, even England captain Harry Kane never managed a run this long - his best stands at two separate five-match streaks.\n\nAnd the only English striker to better Calvert-Lewin in recent memory is Jamie Vardy, who went on an eight-game scoring spree for Leicester City in 2019.\n\nSo could Calvert-Lewin yet force his way into Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the World Cup?",

    "fullText": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be sweating on the fitness of Mason Mount as he prepares for his side’s Premier League match against Wolves on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe former Chelsea man came off at half-time on Sunday in United’s 1-0 win over Newcastle. Amorim said post-match that he was hoping the injury was nothing serious.\n\nIf Mount does make it, an unchanged XI is expected, partly on merit after Sunday but also partly because there are few other options.\n\nHarry Maguire is back on the grass but is unlikely to be ready for action. Matthijs de Ligt and Bruno Fernandes are still injured, and Kobbie Mainoo is also unlikely to have recovered in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Nouss Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are still participating for their countries in AFCON. All three of their nations – Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon (respectively) – are expected to progress to the knockout stages, so they are unlikely to be back until around 10th January or even beyond.\n\nSenne Lammens will continue in goal. Amorim is likely to persist with a back four of Diogo Dalot, Sunday’s Man of the Match Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw.\n\nCasemiro and Manuel Ugarte will once again be the twin sixes. If fit, Mount will play in front of them. Patrick Dorgu was excellent on the right wing on Sunday, so is likely to continue there, with Matheus Cunha on the left and Ben Sesko up top.\n\nIf Mount does not make it, he could be replaced directly by Jack Fletcher as he was at half-time against the Magpies. Alternatively, the boss could revert to a back three, bringing in Leny Yoro as a third centre-back and pushing the full-backs up into wing-back roles.\n\nHowever, Amorim has hinted at more than one press conference that he is reluctant to play Shaw at wing-back due to the physical exertion involved.\n\nAnother possibility would be to play 4-2-3-1 with Josh Zirkzee sitting in behind Sesko. Given the opposition’s struggles this season, it would certainly be an option.\n\nGiven all that, here is our predicted XI for Tuesday’s 8.15pm kick-off:\n\nFeatured image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "You started your professional career in Finland, and one spell that stands out is your time at HJK Helsinki. You won the league and the cup there. How important was that period for you?\n\n“It was huge, to be honest. It is important to understand what you want and how you plan to achieve it. Everyone dreams of winning trophies and playing in the Champions League, but there is a process you have to follow.\n\n“When I arrived in Helsinki, people told me it would be difficult because I was not a local player. Through hard work, I secured my place in the starting eleven. We won the league in my first year. The season before, the club had been fighting to stay in the league and even had playoffs to survive.\n\n“I had a clause in my contract that allowed me to leave if they were relegated. They stayed up, we built a new team, and then won the league. The following season, we qualified for the Champions League. It was the first Finnish club to reach the group stage in 1998, and it still is.\n\n“Playing in the Champions League was incredible. You feel nervous at first, but once the anthem plays, the nerves disappear. I won the Players’ Player of the Year and top scorer. I won everything you can win in Finland, and that was the moment to move on.”\n\nYou moved to Stockport County. At first, you were playing regularly, then a change of manager reduced your game time. Despite that, there was still a lot of interest in you. How do you reflect on your time there?\n\n“It was a great time. It was exactly what I needed because moving from Finland to the Championship was a big jump. I was playing every week, and just before the manager left, I had a chance to join Blackburn.\n\n“The manager left on a Sunday, and on Monday, Blackburn called. They were in the Premier League with Graeme Souness as manager. The new manager at Stockport did not let the move happen.\n\n“Before joining Stockport, I had actually been at Wolves for a few days. They had watched me score five goals in two games in Finland and offered me a contract, but my agent messed things up. I went back to Finland, and a week later, Stockport called.\n\n“They told me that if I joined and we stayed up, they would not stand in the way of a move to a bigger club. It was not written down, but that was the agreement. When the Blackburn move did not happen, I was disappointed, but I then moved to Sheffield Wednesday and continued from there.”\n\n“I loved those games. After playing in the Champions League, your confidence and belief grow because you have played at the highest level.\n\n“The derbies were special. I scored in most of them, and I always thought about the fans. Derby matches are for them. Before the season even begins, those are the fixtures everyone looks for.”\n\nYour time at Sheffield Wednesday was successful from a personal perspective and led to you joining Ipswich Town. How do you reflect on your time there overall?\n\n“I loved Sheffield Wednesday. The club is huge, and the supporters are fantastic. But it was the right club at the wrong time for me. They were in a difficult financial position after relegation from the Premier League.\n\n“The move to Ipswich came through Willie Donachie, who had been assistant manager at Sheffield Wednesday. Joe Royle got the job at Ipswich. Willie joined him, and two days later, he called me asking if I wanted to come on loan. That is how it happened.”\n\nAt Ipswich, you played alongside Darren Bent. You were scoring goals and became the club’s leading scorer. What was that spell like?\n\n“Ipswich felt like home. I remember that Willie Donachie picked me up on Saturday morning, the day after everything had been agreed. We drove to Watford to meet the team at the hotel.\n\n“Joe Royle told me I would start on the bench because I had not trained. We were 1–0 down at halftime. A few minutes before the break, I was told to warm up. I came on and scored with my first touch. Jim Magilton scored the second, and we won 2–1. After that, we won seven matches in a row.\n\n“Playing with Darren Bent was like a dream. He was young, fast, skinny, and a great finisher. We scored so many simple goals. I would win the header from a goal kick, and he would run through and score. You could see immediately that he would have a great career.”\n\nYour performances attracted interest from Blackburn, and you got the chance to play in the Premier League. Was that a dream come true?\n\n“Yes, absolutely. I spent two and a half years at Ipswich, and we reached the playoffs twice. In the first season, we lost to West Ham, and in the second season, we missed automatic promotion and lost to West Ham again.\n\n“I always said that if Ipswich had been promoted, I probably would never have left. I had a very strong connection with the club. When my contract was finishing, the chairman, David Sheepshanks, told me that he knew the dream was to play in the Premier League. They could not offer that at the time, but he did not want to stand in my way. He also told me that if I did not sign for a Premier League club, to speak to him first because he was ready to offer something he had never offered before.\n\n“That meant a lot. Leaving was not easy, even to play in the Premier League. But signing for Blackburn was a dream come true.”\n\nWhat was it like working under Mark Hughes, and how do you reflect on your time at Blackburn?\n\n“I think I did well. In my first Premier League season, I scored seven or eight goals and played regularly. We had Craig Bellamy, who was great to play with. He was very quick and worked hard.\n\n“In January, the club signed Sinama Pongolle on loan from Liverpool, and after that, I did not start as many matches. I always felt that if I had continued to play as much as I had before January, I would have reached double figures in goals.\n\n“Mark Hughes was very quiet but very honest. His presence said a lot because of the clubs he had played for. He always said his door was open if you wanted to talk. He did not speak a lot, but when he walked into a room, you felt it.”\n\nWhen you were leaving Blackburn, Gordon Strachan showed strong interest in signing you for Celtic. How close was that deal?\n\n“I think it was close. I was told about the situation, and there was also interest from Everton. Blackburn reached a point where I had to make a decision. Crystal Palace came in as well, and they wanted to get back to the Premier League.\n\n“If everything had fallen into place, I would have gone to Celtic. But you never really know how close a deal is. I have travelled up and down the country many times, thinking something was close. I learned that until a deal is done, it is never close.”\n\nYou joined Crystal Palace when the club was desperate to return to the Premier League, and Simon Jordan was in charge. What was it like playing for Palace?\n\n“Palace had a very good team at the time. The squad was strong, but I think we had too many egos. There were too many players who felt they had to play, and the atmosphere was not right.\n\nIn successful teams, there is banter, togetherness, and a real spirit. I never felt we had that at Palace.\n\n“Peter Taylor was the manager. As a person, he was one of the nicest men you could meet. He was a gentleman who never wanted to upset anyone. Sometimes, though, a manager needs a tougher side. With the big characters in the squad, I felt we lacked that strength from the manager.”\n\nAfter leaving Palace, you moved to Germany to TuS Koblenz and ended up playing alongside your brother. What was that experience like?\n\n“It was something I always dreamed of. I went to Germany because my brother was there. I wanted to play with him before the end of my career.\n\n“He moved to England very young and signed for Birmingham in the Premier League, but he suffered some bad injuries. Technically, he was better than me. He was taller, more skilful, and very talented. Mentally, I was a bit different, and that helped me in my career.\n\n“When he went to the second tier in Germany, I visited him a few times. Eventually, I decided to join him. Playing together was special. Sharing the pitch with your brother is an incredible feeling.”\n\nYou later returned to the UK and worked under Brendan Rodgers at Swansea. What was it like working with him?\n\n“I knew straight away he was going to have a top career. The standards he set were very high. Everything was organised. Even though Swansea did not have the training facilities they have today, everything felt professional and prepared.\n\n“He demanded a lot from himself first. Players see that. Modern players are clever, and they can tell immediately if a manager drops his standards. Brendan never did. His success does not surprise me. I still keep in touch with him, and he is someone I admire.”\n\nWhen you left Swansea, you were in the Championship with a club aiming for the Premier League. Did you expect to return to the Premier League with a team like Newcastle?\n\n“Honestly, no. Not with a club of that size. When I was at Ipswich, Sir Bobby Robson tried to sign me for Newcastle, so I already knew how huge the club was.\n\n“When the call came, it was a great surprise. You see the Newcastle fans on television, standing in the winter with no shirts on, but you only understand it once you go there. The passion is unbelievable. After a few months, I understood exactly why someone like Alan Shearer never left, even when he had offers from top clubs. The connection with the supporters is special.\n\n“Brendan Rodgers told me honestly that I was not in his plans at Swansea. It hurts at first, but honesty helps you move on. We agreed to terminate the contract because the window was closing, and I wanted options. Then Newcastle called. I felt like a ten-year-old kid. I could not wait to drive up there the next morning.”\n\nAfter Newcastle, you had spells at Oldham Athletic and then Hibernian. How do you reflect on those final stages of your career?\n\n“Newcastle helped me find myself again, but I actually think I finished my career a little too early. I always put pressure on myself, and I had already started my coaching badges. I knew I wanted to go into management.\n\n“Paul Dickov, who I played with at Blackburn, brought me to Oldham. He told me I would play every week and that one day there might even be a chance to take over after him. I wanted to experience League One because it would help me understand another level of the game. I had a good time there.\n\n“Then Hibs came in. Pat Fenlon called me every day. I saw the derby against Hearts, and the atmosphere was fantastic. The training ground was excellent. It felt like the right move.\n\n“But Hibs was the most disappointing part of my career. I barely played. I had maybe one or two starts. I had spent my career in the Championship and Premier League, and suddenly I could not get on the pitch. That situation made me decide to retire.\n\n“I have always been honest. If someone is better than me, fine. But sitting on the bench or being left out entirely is not for me. I train all week for Saturday. If I am not involved, then I want to move on. That is why I changed clubs fairly often.”\n\nFinally, Shefki, who were your toughest individual opponents in the Premier League?\n\n“Rio Ferdinand was always incredibly tough. He was not only strong in the air but also extremely quick. Even if he made a mistake, he could recover immediately, which made him very hard to play against.\n\n“John Terry was another one I really enjoyed battling with. He was brave and physical and would put his head where others would not put their feet. That suited my style because I always loved the fight.”",

    "description": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was rewarded for a change in style and formation with a hard-fought win over Newcastle in the Premier League.",
    "fullText": "As a football idealist, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has specific beliefs about how the game should be played - and the best way to win.\n\nBut his usual philosophy was not the one that brought the Christmas present of a 1-0 Premier League win over Newcastle.\n\nFor one thing, there was the formation switch.\n\nAmorim joked in September that not even the Pope could persuade him to change, but for the first time since he took charge 13 months ago, he fielded a back four.\n\nFor another, victory was achieved with 33.4% possession, their lowest in any game this season. It was United's lowest percentage of possession in a victory since the 29.4% they had when beating against Manchester City in January 2023.\n\nThey had nine shots at Old Trafford compared to Newcastle's 16. The visitors had 43 touches in their opponents' box. Amorim's men had 15.\n\nYet it was Manchester United who prevailed, thanks to a combination of Patrick Dorgu's first goal for the club - which was a sublime first-half volley from the edge of the area - and only a second clean sheet of the season.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. But even for Amorim, sometimes there are days when substance trumps style.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unequivocal reply when asked if this was one of the 'most satisfying' wins of his, at times, tortuous 13 months in charge.\n\n\"The feeling is good. If you compared to other games, we suffered so much more today but in certain moments we put everything on the line.\n\n\"We are defending every cross. Especially if you see the second half, sometimes we managed to defend with a back six.\n\n\"We had so many games when we controlled the opponent so much better, but it is a good feeling to have a clean sheet. We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"",

    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta hailed the “incredible” way his Arsenal squad have dealt with continued setbacks this season after beating Brighton 2-1 to go back to the top of the Premier League.\n\nMartin Odegaard put the Gunners in front on 14 minutes before a Georginio Rutter own goal made it two for Arteta’s side.\n\nBut Diego Gomez set up a nervy ending to the game, with Arsenal again managing to secure a narrow win.\n\nArsenal were without Jurrien Timber through injury for the game, while Riccardo Calafiori pulled out of the starting 11 in the warm up.\n\nAnd Arteta praised his Arsenal players for their adaptability, though says the scoreline should have been more comfortable.\n\n“Very happy with the performance, individually and collectively, so dominant, we were a big threat,” he said.\n\n“So very pleased with all of that.\n\n“But the margin should have been much bigger, I mean with the amount of situations, chances, open chances that we generated through the game. It should never be 2-1.\n\n“But that’s the Premier League, that’s the step that we have to make. I think the first shot that they had they scored the goal and then David (Raya) has to make another save to maintain the result.\n\n“But what I like is that we’re having a lot of issues, we’re dealing with it in an incredible way. Yesterday we lost Jurrien, today we lost Calafiori in the warm-up. Declan has to play as a full-back and you see the performance that he put in. So that’s the spirit and that’s how much our players want it.”\n\nOn Calafiori’s injury, Arteta added: “It’s something that he felt yesterday, something very awkward that happened and today in the warm-up he wasn’t comfortable.”\n\nArsenal have again struggled with persistent injury problems this season, and asked how long his side can survive with these problems, Arteta responded: “I don’t know. At the moment we survive six months, so let’s see. It’s another five and a half to go so hopefully things will get better.\n\n“The good news as well, for example, we got Gabi (Gabriel) back earlier than expected, which is great. The medical staff have done an incredible job. The way he pushes himself as well. That’s what we need because we lost one and we got somebody else back.”",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have accumulated the fewest disciplinary points in the league, with 22 points made up entirely of yellow cards, placing them ahead of Manchester City and Leeds United, who both sit on 27 points.\n\nThe figures mark a clear shift from last season, when Arsenal were shown three red cards in their opening eight league matches.\n\nThose dismissals involved Declan Rice, Leandro Trossard and William Saliba, with Rice and Trossard sent off for kicking the ball away and delaying the restart against Brighton & Hove Albion and Manchester City.\n\nThey have not received any red cards so far this season.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Saturday’s home match against Brighton, Arteta said he believes a change in how the laws are being applied has played a role in Arsenal’s improved red card record.\n\n“I think the rules are different now,” he said.\n\n“So, we paid a big price with that (delaying the restart) rule, and hopefully that stays away and we continue to play with 11 players.”\n\nArteta also reflected on Rice’s dismissal at the Emirates Stadium in August last year, admitting the manner of that performance left a lasting impression.\n\n“I remember it very well,” he said. “I was very hacked off in the manner that we played with 10 men. So hopefully it is going to be very different this time.”\n\nAsked about Arsenal’s position at the top of the fair play standings, Arteta said he was unaware of the statistic but welcomed it.\n\n“I didn’t know. That is good, very good.”\n\nArsenal’s record leaves them ahead of several direct rivals, including Manchester United, Aston Villa and Liverpool, while Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea sit at the bottom of the table.",

    "description": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was rewarded for a change in style and formation with a hard-fought win over Newcastle in the Premier League.",
    "fullText": "As a football idealist, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has specific beliefs about how the game should be played - and the best way to win.\n\nBut his usual philosophy was not the one that brought the Christmas present of a 1-0 Premier League win over Newcastle.\n\nFor one thing, there was the formation switch.\n\nAmorim joked in September that not even the Pope could persuade him to change, but for the first time since he took charge 13 months ago, he fielded a back four.\n\nFor another, victory was achieved with 33.4% possession, their lowest in any game this season. It was United's lowest percentage of possession in a victory since the 29.4% they had when beating against Manchester City in January 2023.\n\nThey had nine shots at Old Trafford compared to Newcastle's 16. The visitors had 43 touches in their opponents' box. Amorim's men had 15.\n\nYet it was Manchester United who prevailed, thanks to a combination of Patrick Dorgu's first goal for the club - which was a sublime first-half volley from the edge of the area - and only a second clean sheet of the season.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. But even for Amorim, sometimes there are days when substance trumps style.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unequivocal reply when asked if this was one of the 'most satisfying' wins of his, at times, tortuous 13 months in charge.\n\n\"The feeling is good. If you compared to other games, we suffered so much more today but in certain moments we put everything on the line.\n\n\"We are defending every cross. Especially if you see the second half, sometimes we managed to defend with a back six.\n\n\"We had so many games when we controlled the opponent so much better, but it is a good feeling to have a clean sheet. We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe headed back to the north-east of England reflecting on yet another disappointing away performance. He admitted his side failed to turn their territorial advantage into the type and volume of meaningful chances that would have earned maximum points.\n\nBut for the home side, the outcome felt significant.\n\nLisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are at other ends of the experience scale.\n\nOne is a World Cup winner, albeit one just returning from the latest in a sequence of bad injuries. The other is a 19-year-old with 15 senior appearances under his belt – who has now extended the longest playing sequence of his first-team career to five games.\n\nPaired together in the middle of a revised back four, with Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot as full-backs and Dorgu switched to the right side of Amorim's attack, Martinez and Heaven were immense.\n\n\"He [Martinez] is a guy with a lot of character,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"He is really good on the ball - and has won a World Cup, so he is used to that stress - but he showed today he is a top player.\n\n\"He is a small guy but today he did well against a team with tall players.\"\n\nThe sight of 5ft 9in Martinez leaping high to win a header against 6ft 6in Nick Woltemade in the first half was impressive.\n\nEven though there was an element of Amorim having to protect a player starting for the first time since February following his recovery from cruciate knee ligament surgery, there must have been concern when Martinez left the field two minutes from time and 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson came on in his place.\n\nFredricson did his job well. But he had Heaven with him to bring more solidity.\n\nIt is hard to believe when the former Arsenal youngster started against West Ham on 4 December, he was booked almost immediately and looked so shaky, it was almost a shock he lasted until half-time when he was replaced by Leny Yoro.\n\nIn the space of five games and three weeks, Heaven has advanced rapidly.\n\nHe was excellent in the defeat at Aston Villa on 21 December and followed that up with a performance of maturity against Newcastle that earned him the host broadcaster's man-of-the-match award.\n\nSo good has Heaven been that Amorim is warning Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, currently sidelined, they can't be certain of getting their places back when they are fit again.\n\nThat is significant in two ways. Firstly, De Ligt was, by common consent, United's best defender until a back injury ruled him out of the West Ham game. Maguire, meanwhile, is still waiting to learn whether United will offer him a new contract when his current one expires in the summer.\n\n\"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He trained really well, which shows if you train well, it can help you play.\n\n\"If he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

A free edition is also sent on Mondays – you can \n\nAs Premier League squads begin physically conditioning themselves for the Christmas schedule from mid-December, the former players among the coaching staff often find themselves laughing at how it used to be.\n\nBack in the mid-1990s, it could mean four games in nine – or even eight – days. There were barely any breaks. It already sounds unhealthy for players, but it was also about how it felt. Some from the mid-2000s now shake their heads at how their main memory of the period wasn’t jaded legs or turkey at the training ground, but an upset stomach. That was because many players effectively had “caffeine routines” on matchdays, which they then had to repeat again and again in quick succession.\n\nI used to ghostwrite a column for Stephen Hunt, and he told me that for a 3pm kick-off it would be two coffees in the morning, followed by a Red Bull – or an energy drink called Phase 1, the equivalent of around six coffees – and usually some caffeine tablets on top. Their heart rate would already be elevated before they played, and they could barely eat afterwards because their stomach was so raw.\n\nOn the sound of that, it probably ought to form part of the argument over whether caffeine should be banned from football.\n\nPreparation is obviously far more scientific now, even if those discarded snus pouches have become a familiar sight around some training grounds.\n\nAt the very least, we are long past the point where the congested Christmas schedule functioned as a mini stress test for a team’s endurance over the season. There even used to be some correlation between who collected the most points at Christmas and who eventually won the league.\n\nThis season, the schedule more closely resembles a standard European rhythm. All teams are playing four games across 11 to 13 days – weekend, midweek, weekend, midweek. Many are well used to that cadence, even if the fact that every one of these matches is a Premier League game brings a different level of intensity.\n\nWhat this spell now offers is a test of a different kind – and one that hints at a broader evolution in football. It is the shift from manager-led clubs to what might be called “performance-led” clubs: organisations where science dictates decision-making at every level.\n\nThat may sound surprising given that every coaching staff is now surrounded by reams of data. The difference, however, lies in how much those decisions are actually shaped by it.\n\nIt has become the bane of some sporting directors’ careers.\n\nTo keep reading and unlock the full Friday edition of Miguel Delaney: Inside Football, \n\nTo receive the free, Monday newsletter simply enter your email address in the box at the top of this page.\n\nYou can also head to our newsletter preference centre to \n\nOnce there, all you need to do is press the ‘+’ button and enter your email address.\n\nMiguel Delaney's Inside Football newsletter lands in your inbox every Monday and Friday (The Independent)",

    "fullText": "Juventus are reportedly laying the groundwork for a significant defensive reinforcement as they keep a close watch on the Premier League. According to transfer expert Matteo Moretto, as relayed by IlBianconero, the Bianconeri have set their sights on Bournemouth’s Marcos Senesi.\n\nThe Argentine center-back is emerging as a concrete summer target for the Turin giants, largely due to his precarious contract situation. With his current deal with the Cherries set to expire in June 2026, the upcoming summer window represents the final opportunity for Bournemouth to secure a significant fee, or risk losing him for nothing. Juventus are attentive to these dynamics as they look to add quality and international experience to their backline.\n\nThis is not the first time Senesi’s name has crossed the desks at Continassa. The report clarifies that Juventus have been given the chance to sign the former Feyenoord man in previous transfer windows, but a deal never materialized. Now, with a more favorable economic outlook and a clear need for a left-footed defender, the “Old Lady” appears ready to reignite their interest.\n\nWhile a January move seems unlikely given Bournemouth’s desire to keep him for their survival battle, Juve are positioning themselves at the front of the queue for July. Senesi’s familiarity with high-tempo football and his ball-playing ability make him an ideal fit for the project currently being built in Turin.",

One rule for one - come on, Pep!\"\n\nHe explained his philosophy around the festive period: \"I just look for my players to have a bit of common sense. I don't mind them having a Christmas dinner, why not?\" He believes \"psychology is important as anything with athletes\" and Christmas Day is \"a big part\" of life.\n\nFitness is \"very important\" but he isn't \"obsessed over weights\". He will \"encourage\" his players to \"enjoy\" the festivities, especially because they don't play until 27 December.\n\nOn opposition manager Guardiola, Dyche said: \"It is fantastic what he has achieved, there's no two ways about it. Only Sir Alex Ferguson probably tops him. He has done massive things for himself, his players and football in general.\"\n\nThe Reds will be hoping Manchester City are \"having a quiet day\" when they visit the City Ground. However, Forest will still need to play \"very well\" because they are facing a team who are \"always prepared\".\n\nDyche added: \"It's unlikely we are going to dominate the ball, so we have to be defensively sound and do all the hard yards.\"\n\nNottingham Forest's Premier League win-loss-win-loss-win-loss form \"will do\" this season, \"if it keeps going\". He explained: \"If you do the stats, if that carried on for the whole season then it would equal a pretty good situation.\"\n\nHowever, the biggest thing for Dyche is the team \"finding consistency\" - whether that be in terms of their \"training schedule or performances\" - but he recognises that will take time.\n\nHe is predicting a \"slow\" January transfer window because of the club's investment in the summer. On the other hand, he added: \"The club have shown that if players become available at the right times, they can make things happen - so you never know.\"\n\nFollow all of Tuesday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): I know a lot of people will say \"it was 3-0 against West Ham\". But he made four or five massive saves in the early part of the second half, which kept them ahead and gave them a fighting chance to win. Manchester City have been good, but not setting the world alight defensively. Donnarumma has to keep providing and turning up with big performances.\n\nReece James (Chelsea): We have had Reece in the team a few times and, ahead of the World Cup, he looks the real deal. We have never questioned his ability, but he falls into the 'if he is fit' category. At the moment he has not had an injury for a year and touch wood that continues. His free-kick in the draw at Newcastle was a pearler.\n\nPiero Hincapie (Arsenal): Slightly going under the radar for Arsenal. They brought him in late, when other people were looking at him, and he has been excellent. A solid performance against Everton.\n\nJoachim Andersen (Fulham): For years he has come with class for Fulham. He hits that lovely raking diagonal pass and his organisational skills also help. He organises and marshalls that defence, and did so again against Forest. He is very astute.\n\nAntonee Robinson (Fulham): It is good to see him back. A big season with a World Cup coming up and he is vital for the United States. He had some tough times with injuries but is starting to show he is getting back to his best.\n\nKeane Lewis-Potter (Brentford): He has previously been deployed at full-back but now we are starting to see him in his more favoured position further up the field. Two wonderful goals in a huge game for Brentford at Wolves and a win that has probably already sealed their survival.\n\nEthan Ampadu (Leeds): I really, really like this player. I like what he is about. Not only has he grown as a player since he left Chelsea but he has grown as a human and a real leader. Big tackles, big moments, he is always there and got a goal in the victory against Palace.\n\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa): The man of the moment. Two goals again - both wonderful finishes against Manchester United. Is Rogers the guy to lead England? Do you leave out Bellingham? Foden? Palmer? Just how well he is playing would suggest you would have to have a serious conversation about it. He has seven goals for Villa and is flying.\n\nNick Woltemade (Newcastle): He scored two goals and should probably have got a hat-trick against Chelsea at the weekend. It looks like the return of Yoane Wissa has given him a little spark and put that devil back in him. He is scoring and getting in the right positions. A few weeks ago he went off the boil a bit and maybe he had got a bit comfortable.\n\nErling Haaland (Manchester City): The guvnor, the king. He scored two but probably should have got four if I am being really critical. He is just a machine. His next goal will be his 150th in all competitions for Manchester City in five years. Let that sink in. That is frightening. You could put him in my team every week.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin (Leeds): People are asking if he could make a sneaky run into the England set-up for the summer. I think it would be a big ask considering the amount of injuries he has had over the course of his career. Right now let's just enjoy him being back, fit and playing - and when he is fit and playing he scores goals. That's all that really matters.\n\nDaniel Farke (Leeds United): A brilliant victory against Crystal Palace. Only two weeks ago, people were saying Palace were top-four contenders and were also saying Farke was under real pressure. Now, when you look at it, Leeds are probably favoured to stay up from this position. They have given themselves a fighting chance and this was easily the result of the weekend.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Fulham may have had to wait nearly a year for a Premier League penalty, but its conversion should never have been in doubt.\n\nRaul Jimenez calmly slotted home the Cottagers' first penalty since the 2-2 draw with Ipswich in January 2025 to earn Fulham a 1-0 win against Nottingham Forest and move to within two spot-kicks of breaking a Premier League record.\n\nThe Mexican has now joined Yaya Toure as being the only players, from those who have taken 10 or more, to have converted all of them. Both have now scored 11 from 11.\n\nChelsea's Cole Palmer went ahead of Toure when he scored two penalties against Tottenham in December 2024, giving him 12 from 12, but he then had a penalty saved against Leicester in March to end his 100% strike rate.\n\nJimenez now needs two more successful penalties to become the Premier League player to score the most successful spot-kicks before missing one.\n\nOn waiting for the goalkeeper to move before striking the ball, he said: \"It's always what I do. I do it well, so it's something I have been training my whole career. I like to have this pressure with these penalties. I'm happy to score.\n\n\"I've never missed [a penalty in the Premier League]. I'm really happy about that, so I want to keep doing it like that. More penalties to come, I'll be there.\"\n\nBryan Mbeumo joined the 100% club when he made it 10 from 10 in April but that perfect record was ended when he had a penalty saved for Brentford against Fulham a month later.\n\nFormer Brentford team-mate Ivan Toney was another who had scored 10 out of 10 but he was unable to match Toure's record when he missed his 11th penalty against Newcastle in 2023.",

His decision-making – when to pass it, where to pass it, what foot to pass it to, his detail on his pass – it was a pleasure to watch. He was absolutely incredible.\n\n“He was splitting centre-backs, taking the ball off [Arsenal’s] centre-backs, acting as a third centre-back, then next minute he’s in the box, trying to score a goal. Sometimes, some of the stuff he does is a bit underrated.\n\n“He’s the right one to take over [Kane] for me, because [of] his drive, his personality.

He is one of the best around at the moment.\n\n\"At the start of the season, Villa fans were booing him because he'd had his head turned! You have to give credit to Emery as manager here for backing him.\n\n\"He didn't take him out of the squad, he left him in there to deal with the pressure. That has taken him to a different level, along with some other players, and you can see Rogers is excited to play because he just glides past players.\n\n\"I would pay good money every week to go and watch him - that is how good he is. \"\n\nListen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Manchester City picked up a comfortable 3-nil win over West Ham at the Etihad Stadium yesterday to maintain the pressure on Premier League leaders Arsenal. A brace from Erling Haaland and a first-half goal from Tijjani Reijnders were enough to see City pick up a valuable three points. Pep Guardiola’s side barely had to get out of second gear yesterday against a struggling West Ham side. They made it seven consecutive wins in all competitions with their victory yesterday. But while City are racking up the wins, Pep Guardiola threw down a challenge to his players after their win yesterday. He believes that his team needs to go up a level to contend for silverware this season.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 3-nil win over West Ham, Pep Guardiola said he wants to see more from his team. He specifically spoke on their play in possession as an area that needs to improve. The Manchester City manager explained: “We are happy to win but the way we are with the ball, we have to improve otherwise it will not be enough to be title contenders in March, April and May.”\n\n“Always I have to thank Erling for the goals but today thanks to him, Phil and Nico O’Reilly, they help us a lot to do this game.”\n\n“Defensively we are improving and we can visualise it but with the ball, we are away from what we have to do. We are not close. The way we attack depends on how the opponents defend, we have to be in the right spots to make it more fluid and we were not.”\n\n“We are happy, we cannot deny we are in the Champions League spots, the semi-final of the Carabao Cup and up there in the Premier League.”\n\nA more telling quote from Pep Guardiola came when he urged his team to follow him and continue to improve. He added: “We will be there. If they follow me, we will be there, but we have to improve.”\n\n“I know the level but it’s not enough. The spirit, the aggression, the hunger is there. All the attributes they need that is not highlights. Many things, we have to do better.”\n\nEven though Manchester City have won seven consecutive matches in all competitions, Pep Guardiola’s assessment is on the money. There are obvious areas where this City team can improve. They were on display early in the second half of yesterday’s match. Manchester City struggled to play out from the back at the beginning of the second half. One misplaced pass from Bernardo Silva almost gifted West Ham a way back into the game. That is one clear area of City’s play that needs to improve. Manchester City have struggled at times this season to play out from the back, and that is a major area in which City can improve.\n\nThere are of course others. Pep Guardiola’s side is yet to establish the control of matches that they typically have and have built their play around. They were better in this regard yesterday but this portion of their play remains a work in progress. The major positive is that City are well placed to launch into the second half of this season despite having so many areas of their play which can improve. That is a major positive to take from Manchester City’s strong recent run of results.\n\nPep Guardiola has laid down the gauntlet to his team. He wants to see them to continue to improve so they can contend for silverware this season. Manchester City are entering a phase of the season where they have typically launched into title winning campaigns. But this is a new-look City team that needs to improve to match what their predecessors were able to do so often in the past. If this City team can follow suit anything is possible for Pep Guardiola’s side this season.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal will spend Christmas Day on top of the Premier League tree this year, while Wolves, Burnley and West Ham are hanging precariously on the bottom branches.\n\nAs we approach the halfway point of the season, what do the ghosts of Christmas past tell us about the title race and relegation battle?\n\nThe team that is top of the Premier League on Christmas Day has gone on to win the title in 17 of the previous 33 seasons – basically a flip of a chocolate coin.\n\nHowever, Arsenal themselves have a much bleaker record as they've been top at Christmas four times before but have never gone on to lift the trophy.\n\nThe Gunners had only been top at this stage twice before Mikel Arteta took charge, but this is the third time in four seasons that they sit top of the tree at Christmas.\n\nTheir fans will hope that the wisdom Arteta's men have received in seasons past will see them finally hold off Manchester City and deliver the gift they've been wishing for since 2004.\n\n\"You'd like to think that through all the experiences that Arsenal have had being top at Christmas, they can understand the mistakes made in the back half of some seasons that stopped them from winning the title,\" former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha told Football Focus.\n\nThere isn't a lot of room for error though as Arsenal have a slender lead of just two points, while the average lead by the team top on Christmas Day is four points.\n\nIn fact, the only table-toppers at Christmas to have a smaller lead than Arsenal in the last 12 seasons were the Gunners themselves two years ago.\n\nBut while a two-point lead isn't much, history suggests it might be enough.\n\nArsenal are the eighth side in Premier League history to have a two-point lead at Christmas and five of the previous seven went on to win the title, including the last four.\n\nBizarrely Arsenal are the only side to win the Premier League without ever doing it when they were top at Christmas, as all three of their titles came when chasing the leaders at this time of year.\n\nThey were sixth and an incredible 13 points behind leaders Man Utd in 1997-98, second and three points behind Newcastle in 2001-02 and third and one point behind Man Utd at Christmas time in 2003-04.\n\nThat 13-point deficit in 1997-98 is the most points a team has ever been behind the leaders at Christmas and won the title (Arsenal did have a game in hand), while the lowest the eventual champions have been in the table at this stage is eighth, by Manchester City in the Covid-delayed season of 2020-21.\n\nWeirdly the team in second on Christmas Day has gone on to win the title in only two of the past 17 seasons, although both times it was Manchester City who did so.\n\nIn fact, in the last five seasons where the leaders at Christmas did not go on to win the title, the Premier League was won each time by Manchester City.\n\nFor many Arsenal fans, there will be a sense of deja vu. Leading the Premier League at Christmas before being eaten up by a relentless Pep Guardiola side is something the Gunners have got a little bit used to.\n\nSeeing a seven-point lead over Manchester City cut to two in the space of five games won't exactly fill them with confidence either.\n\n\"We're back on top of the table but we're not watching City too much, or the other teams,\" said Bukayo Saka. \"We're in control now. We know if we win every week we'll stay there.\"\n\nArteta added: \"The only thing we can control is our own performance and results and we know how long it's going to be and how tough is this league. That's it.\"\n\nManchester City have obviously got history on their side. Guardiola has won the Premier League title six times, the Bundesliga three times with Bayern Munich and La Liga three times with Barcelona. Arteta has no league titles as a manager.\n\nGuardiola's squad are full of Premier League winners, players who know what it takes to end a campaign strong, while none of the Arsenal squad have won a Premier League – but have experienced losing leads over the past few seasons.\n\nWhy can't this season be different though? Manchester City look far from the relentless side they have in previous seasons – and have already lost four games this campaign, compared to Arsenal's two losses.\n\n\"We will be there. If they follow me we will be there but we have to improve,\" said Guardiola.\n\n\"I know the level in Europe, in the Premier League, I know Arsenal and the other teams and how tough they are. It is not enough.\n\n\"The spirit is there, last season we did not have the spirit or aggression or hunger - all the attributes they need. It is not about the highlights and how good the actions are, there is something that comes from inside where we will recover from the Club World Cup.\"\n\nCity's attack is flowing, having scored 10 more goals than Arsenal, but having also conceded six more – you feel the title race could be defined by whether City's goals can outshine Arsenal's solidity.\n\nOnly four times in 33 Premier League seasons has the side bottom on Christmas Day survived, with the most recent being Wolves in 2022-23.\n\nBut with just two points won and a record 16 points from safety, it would take not just a Christmas miracle but a New Year's, Valentine's and Easter one too for bottom side Wolves to survive once again.\n\nSecond-bottom Burnley have a fighting chance as almost half the teams in their position at Christmas have stayed up, although the only time that's happened in the past eight seasons was when Eddie Howe led Newcastle to 11th in 2021-22.\n\nWest Ham fans have the most reason to be optimistic as the team in 18th has survived in two out of three seasons on average, most recently Nottingham Forest in 2022-23 and Wolves last time out.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that one of West Ham, Burnley and Wolves will stay up as that's happened just over half the time, with two teams surviving in 12 of the previous 33 seasons.\n\nThe three teams bottom at Christmas have never all survived while only four times in Premier League history have all three been relegated, although two of those occurred recently in 2020-21 and 2023-24.\n\nIn terms of who could be relegated in their place, the team flying highest at Christmas that ultimately went down were Norwich in 1994-95, who were seventh with 30 points and 11 points above the drop.\n\nThat was in a 42-game season though. In a 38-game campaign, the best team on Christmas Day to be relegated were Blackpool in 2010-11, who were 10th with 22 points but finished 19th with 39 points.\n\nNewcastle in 2008-09 were 12th with 22 points and went down, while the most points a relegated side has been above the bottom three at Christmas is seven by Reading in 2007-08, who were 12th with 21 points.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Leeds United return to Elland Road on Saturday night, aiming to extend their Premier League unbeaten run to four matches as they welcome Crystal Palace to West Yorkshire.\n\nLeeds came from behind to secure a deserved 1-1 draw away at Brentford last weekend, continuing their recent upturn under Daniel Farke.\n\nThat point followed impressive performances against behemoths, and Leeds now sit 17th in the table.\n\nThey are three points clear of the relegation zone, with momentum in their favour.\n\nHowever, Farke knows his Leeds team will have to bring their A-game against this tricky Palace side in pursuit of European football.\n\nLeeds have enjoyed a revival since Farke’s switch to a 3-5-2 system, which has somehow made them more fluid and confident in the final third.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has been the chief beneficiary, scoring in four consecutive Premier League matches, the joint-longest active run in Europe’s top five leagues.\n\nLeeds have scored as many goals in their last five games as they managed in their previous 11 combined.\n\nElland Road has also become a more open, chaotic arena of late.\n\nLeeds have scored and conceded in each of their last six home league games, with end-to-end football becoming the norm.\n\nMeanwhile, Crystal Palace arrive fresh from a bruising 3-0 home defeat to Manchester City, a scoreline that flattered, given the Eagles generated enough chances to win.\n\nWastefulness proved costly, and Oliver Glasner’s side now face another quick turnaround following Thursday night’s Conference League draw with KuPS.\n\nPalace remain fifth in the table, just two points off the top four, but their domestic form immediately after European fixtures has been a recurring concern.\n\nLeeds have taken five points from their last three league games, a run that included Chelsea, Liverpool, and Brentford.\n\nOn the other hand, Palace have failed to win any of their five league matches played directly after a Conference League fixture this season (D1, L4).\n\nHowever, Palace will take solace from their record against Leeds, having beaten the hosts in their last two league meetings.\n\nThe Eagles haven’t lost to Leeds since 2021.\n\nThe Whites and the Eagles have faced off 52 times, with Leeds winning 24 and drawing 13 of those matches, dating back to a League Cup encounter in 1962.\n\nCrystal Palace have won 10 league games on the road in 2025, the highest number of any Premier League club.\n\nBut Leeds’ home form will inspire confidence, having collected three-quarters of their Premier League points tally at Elland Road, 12 of 16.\n\nLeeds will have to work to break Palace, though. Only league leaders Arsenal (10) have conceded fewer league goals than the Eagles (15) this season.\n\nThe home team will again be without the ‘excellent’ Lukas Nmecha, who has been ruled out with a hamstring issue despite fans hoping for a return.\n\nSean Longstaff and Daniel James also remain sidelined, leaving Farke with an unchanged pool of options.\n\nWith Nmecha unavailable, Noah Okafor is expected to continue alongside Calvert-Lewin in attack, despite missing chances at Brentford.\n\nItalian international Wilfried Gnonto (13 caps) is likely to remain among the substitutes, as the current system favours wing-backs over traditional wingers.\n\nThe midfield trio of Anton Stach, Ethan Ampadu, and Ao Tanaka should be retained, while Jayden Bogle and Gabriel Gudmundsson continue in the wing-back roles.\n\nThe back three of Pascal Struijk, Jaka Bijol, and Joe Rodon is also set to remain intact in front of Lucas Perri.\n\nCrystal Palace are stretched defensively. Daichi Kamada, Daniel Munoz, Cheick Doucoure, Chadi Riad, Rio Cardines, and Caleb Kporha are all unavailable.\n\nIsmaila Sarr is away on Africa Cup of Nations duty.\n\nLucas Perri; Joe Rodon, Jaka Bijol, Pascal Struijk; Jayden Bogle, Anton Stach, Ethan Ampadu, Ao Tanaka, Gabriel Gudmundsson; Noah Okafor, Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle host Chelsea in the Premier League amid growing speculation around Enzo Maresca’s future at the Blues.\n\nThe Italian has been linked with Manchester City this week if Pep Guardiola leaves the club at the end of the season, and hit back at those reports on Friday while insisting he remains committed to the Stamford Bridge project.\n\nMaresca said after Chelsea’s 2-0 win over Everton last weekend that “many people” at the club did not support him, leaving to his “worst 48 hours” in charge. But the win lifted Chelsea to fourth in the Premier League and they could consolidate that position at St James’ Park.\n\nNewcastle, though, will be desperate for a response after their 1-0 defeat to rivals Sunderland last weekend, though Eddie Howe’s side did bounce back by beating Fulham in midweek to join Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-finals.\n\nThe Premier League match kicks off at 12:30pm on Saturday 20 December at St James’ Park.\n\nIt will be shown on TNT Sports and Discovery+.\n\nNewcastle could be down to just two fit senior defenders after Tino Livramento was ruled out with a knee injury and with Lewis Hall a doubt. Dan Burn, Kieran Trippier, Emil Krafth and Sven Botman are all sidelined, as well as Nick Pope.\n\nChelsea remain without Liam Delap, Levi Colwill, Romeo Lavia and Estevao. Delap could return to face Aston Villa next week. Moises Caicedo returns from suspension.\n\nNewcastle XI: Ramsdale; Murphy, Schar, Thiaw, Hall; Guimaraes, Tonali, Joelinton; Elanga, Woltemade, Gordon\n\nChelsea XI: Sanchez; James, Fofana, Chalobah, Cucurella; Fernandez, Caicedo; Neto, Palmer, Garnacho; Pedro",

You don't become a bad coach in four months.\n\n\"You are working tirelessly and you are fully committed. It's what you I am an emotional person and I wear my heart in my sleeve.\n\n\"To get the team to this position in the Premier League and see it change so quickly is hurtful.

    "fullText": "Could fast-charging Manchester City top the Premier League at Christmas or will Arsenal cling on to the festive number one spot?\n\nPep Guardiola's City host struggling West Ham at home on Saturday after six straight wins in all competitions, while the Gunners face a tricky trip to Everton later in the day.\n\nAston Villa take on Manchester United, looking to maintain an astonishing run that has catapulted them into the title race, while Liverpool travel to face stumbling Tottenham.\n\nPep Guardiola's Manchester City have clicked ominously into gear and are just two points behind long-time Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\nThe Gunners have a tough run of league fixtures coming up, starting away at Everton, with Brighton, Aston Villa, Bournemouth and Liverpool to follow.\n\nCity, hungry to reclaim the title they lost to Liverpool last year, will go top of the table, at least temporarily, if they beat the Hammers.\n\nMikel Arteta's team looked jaded in their 2-1 win against bottom side Wolverhampton last week and were lucky to escape with three points after an own goal deep into stoppage time.\n\nThey managed just two shots on target despite their rich attacking resources.\n\nArteta also lamented \"horrible defensive habits that are nowhere near the levels required\" against Wolves but that must be put in the context of a spate of serious injuries.\n\nWilliam Saliba was back for the trip to Molineux but Gabriel Magalhaes and Cristhian Mosquera are on the treatment table while the Gunners lost Ben White with a hamstring injury during the match.\n\nArsenal remain favourites to win their first Premier League title since 2004 but cannot afford to let City take charge.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City remain the clear favourites to win the Premier League but it is difficult to rule out Aston Villa.\n\nUnai Emery's side, who did not even manage a goal in their first four games this season, have won 10 of their past 11 league matches and are just three points behind Arsenal.\n\nBut it is not just the wins -- it is the manner of the victories.\n\nVilla twice came from behind to beat West Ham 3-2 last week after recovering from two goals down to beat Brighton and scoring a last-gasp winner against Arsenal.\n\nEmery says his players are not feeling under pressure.\n\n\"We are feeling ambitious and we try to challenge in Europe and in the Premier League,\" said the Spaniard. \"Enjoy each match, try to prepare, then rest.\n\n\"The players must feel comfortable doing it. This is the process we are doing. Now it is Manchester United.\"\n\nEmery conjured a victory against United at Villa Park in his first match in charge but that remains the only time Villa have beaten the Red Devils at home in the Premier League since 1995.\n\nThomas Frank admitted there was no \"quick fix\" at Tottenham after their painful 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest last week.\n\nBut how patient will the Spurs hierarchy be after just four wins in their past 14 games in all competitions.\n\nFans endured a terrible Premier League campaign under Ange Postecoglou last season, when the club finished 17th, but at least they were entertained and ultimately celebrated Europa League glory.\n\nThere has been little tangible progress under former Brentford boss Frank, whose 11th-placed team are hosting champions Liverpool.\n\nAfter 16 league games in 2024/25, Postecoglou's team had scored 11 more goals and conceded two fewer than Frank's side.\n\nStrikingly, only Everton, Sunderland and Wolves have had fewer shots on target than Tottenham, even though they reinforced their attack in the summer transfer window, bringing in Mohammed Kudus, Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nFrank is confident he will get the time to turn things around but the clock is ticking.\n\nSaturday (1500 GMT unless stated)\n\nNewcastle v Chelsea (1230), Bournemouth v Burnley, Brighton v Sunderland, Manchester City v West Ham, Wolves v Brentford, Tottenham v Liverpool (1730), Everton v Arsenal, Leeds v Crystal Palace (both 2000)\n\nAston Villa v Manchester United",

    "fullText": "Dan Ballard says Granit Xhaka's arrival raised the standards at Sunderland to help them compete in the top half of the Premier League.\n\nSwitzerland midfielder Xhaka was one of several summer signings following the club's promotion from the Championship through the play-offs.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who joined from Bayer Leverkusen, was installed as captain, and his leadership has had a clear impact on a side that has settled right back into life in the top flight.\n\nSunderland are currently eighth in the table - just two points off the top four - following their 1-0 derby win against Newcastle on Sunday.\n\nBallard, who was in Arsenal's academy when Xhaka was at the Gunners, told Football Focus: \"He's an amazing guy.\n\n\"I was a bit surprised when we signed him. I wasn't sure what it'd be like. I didn't think one person could affect the team the way he's done.\n\n\"From minute one, I think the standards really rose because he does everything to 100%.\n\n\"It's kind of like, well if he's got that amazing career and he's still doing everything perfectly, why wouldn't we? And I think it just sort of lifted the standards.\"\n\nSunderland have won seven and lost just four of their 16 league games, and Ballard attributed Xhaka's influence to that winning mentality.\n\n\"I mean literally everything, from the work in the gym to the standards, he puts out on the training pitch,\" added the centre-back, 26.\n\n\"You know we've just been outside, it can be cold and wet and but he's 100% focused and giving everything in training.\n\n\"So when some of us boys may be not putting that work in and you see him doing it, it's unacceptable for us.\n\n\"If he's doing it, he's won titles and played hundreds of games in the Premier League. Then why shouldn't we? It's lifted everyone.\"",
