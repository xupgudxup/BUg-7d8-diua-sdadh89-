The Old Gold scored their first second half goal in 11 Premier League home matches.",
    "fullText": "Wolves manager Rob Edwards, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We started the game well. I think we made a couple of ludicrous decisions in the penalties. And you can't give a team like that with the quality that they've got that sort of headstart.\n\n\"After that, with the feel around the place, it affected one or two. It wasn't a good environment to play in, up until half time. It was important to get in and fix one or two things. Which we did. The challenge then was for the players to show some character, some belief and understand that what we'll try and do now is win the second half - which we did.\"\n\n\"We'll learn a lot. We're going through a process, we've got to make some changes. We've done that in the window with people leaving, the lads coming in were excellent, Adam [Armstrong] and Angel [Gomes] were really good. Real positives for us.\n\n\"It's going to take some time to get it to where we want to be. But there were a lot of signs in the second half against a quality team that everyone is there, and willing to fight and keep doing it.\"\n\nOn new signings Armstrong and Gomes: \"I thought they were brave, worked incredibly hard, showed lots and lots of quality. Angel got on the ball and looked to try and make things happen, was really busy and bright.\n\n\"Adam was incredibly hard working, linked it really well, looked aggressive at the right times. Very very pleased - I thought they were both a big plus for us.\"\n\nWolves have gained just eight points in the Premier League this season (W1 D5 L19), the fewest points tally after 25 games in the competition's history and Wolves' worst ever league season after 25 matches.\n\nThe Old Gold scored their first second half goal in 11 Premier League home matches. It had been 469 second half minutes since their last goal at Molineux in August 2025 against Everton.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United will be looking to make it four wins out of four under interim boss Michael Carrick when they welcome Tottenham Hotspur to Old Trafford for an intriguing Premier League clash on Saturday lunchtime.\n\nThe two teams butt heads for the first time since August when Matthijs de Ligt scored a 96th-minute equaliser for the Red Devils in a 2-2 draw in North London.\n\nIt is fair to say that Man United have turned a corner since the departure of Ruben Amorim and arrival of Carrick, with the Red Devils picking up nine points from a possible nine available under their new boss and extending their unbeaten Premier League run to seven matches (W4 D3).\n\nUnited are unbeaten in all nine of their Premier League matches this season when they have had less possession than their opponents (W7 D2), prevailing in all seven when having less than 45%. In contrast, they have won only four of their 15 top-flight games when in control of +50% of the ball (D6 L5).\n\nA win for the Red Devils against Tottenham would also see them claim four consecutive victories for the first time since February 2024 under Erik ten Hag. However, success against Spurs has been hard to come by in recent years, with United failing to win any of their last six league encounters with the North Londoners (D3 L3) – their joint-longest run without a win against them (also six between 1914 and 1921).\n\nUnited duo Patrick Dorgu and De Ligt remain sidelined with respective thigh and back injuries, while this weekend’s game will come too soon for Mason Mount who recently picked up a knock in training.\n\nCarrick is expected to stick with his winning formula and not make wholesale changes to his starting lineup, but he may be tempted to recall Sesko in attack after his impact as a substitute last time out. That would result in one of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo or Matheus Cunha making way, though.\n\nCaptain Bruno Fernandes has registered more assists than any other Premier League player so this season, with his 12 also his joint-best tally in a single campaign (level with 2020-21). The playmaker is expected to continue in an advanced central role behind the central striker.\n\nIt’s a half past noon kickoff in the UK, which means a 7:30 a.m. kickoff on the East Coast of the U.S.\n\nThe match is on Sky Sports Premier League in the UK. Those Stateside can watch on USA or NBC Streaming streaming. In Canada, it’s on DAZN and Fubo.\n\nEveryone else, head on over to LiveSoccerTV to find your viewing options.\n\nManchester United possible starting lineup: Lammens; Dalot, Maguire, Martinez, Shaw; Mainoo, Casemiro; Diallo, Fernandes, Mbeumo; Cunha",

    "description": "After Leeds' win over Nottingham Forest on Friday, BBC Sport looks at what it all means for the Premier League relegation battle.",
    "fullText": "One down, three to go for Leeds.\n\nBefore their crucial win against Nottingham Forest, boss Daniel Farke said he expected four more victories would seal his side's Premier League survival.\n\nFriday's dominant 3-1 triumph, thanks to goals from Jayden Bogle, Noah Okafor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, moved them nine points clear of the relegation zone and chalked one off.\n\nThey now sit on 29 points - already enough to survive in both of the past two seasons.\n\n\"It was a game with a bit more on the line,\" said Farke afterwards. \"It feels sometimes a bit more important than other games.\n\n\"To deliver in this way with such a spirited performance, it's sometimes more perfect than an easy 4-0 or 5-0. It was a massive performance.\"\n\nTheir advantage over the bottom three may be cut back to six points if West Ham win at Burnley in another huge game on Saturday, but little would dampen the mood at a sodden Elland Road.\n\nSo what does this result really mean for Leeds, Forest and the wider relegation picture?\n\nOnly three times have teams been relegated at the end of a 38-game Premier League season having been on at least 29 points at this stage.\n\nSunderland, who were on 29 points after 25 games finished 18th in 1996-97, while Ipswich and Birmingham City, who were on 30 in 2001-02 and 2010-11 respectively, also ended the season in 18th.\n\nOn average, the team finishing in 17th ends up on 38 points - and, just as Farke suggested pre-match, three more wins from their 13 remaining games would see Leeds get there.\n\nThings don't look too bad for Nottingham Forest either, though.\n\nOnly three teams have gone down at the end of a 38-game season after being on 26 points at this stage.\n\nOf the past nine teams who have been relegated, Leicester's 24 points in 2022-23 is the most any team who finished inside the bottom three had after 25 games.\n\nFollowing Friday's match, Opta predicts that Leeds have only a 4.75% chance of going down, with Forest on 10.24%.\n\nWest Ham are 83.88% likely to go down - although that could yet change after Saturday's game - while Burnley (98.35%) and Wolves (99.99%) appear to be all but down already.\n\nFarke seemed on the brink of losing his job earlier this season, but has overseen a stunning turnaround in his side's form.\n\nIt began when he opted to tear up the gameplan at Manchester City in November, reverting to a 3-5-2 formation with two up top and only being condemned to defeat after City scored a stoppage-time winner.\n\nThat result left them sitting inside the bottom three on goal difference, but their fortunes have markedly changed in the matches that have followed.\n\nLeeds have lost just two of their past 12 games and picked up 18 points.\n\n\"They've been on a great run since that Manchester City game way before Christmas,\" ex-Leeds midfielder Stuart Dallas said on Sky Sports.\n\n\"They had the change of shape, the change of formation and they've put a really good run together.\n\n\"They were excellent throughout the game [against Nottingham Forest] and it's a big win. Psychologically it is huge for them ahead of a weekend of big fixtures.\"\n\nForest, meanwhile, have won just two of their past nine Premier League games.\n\nCrucially, one of those was a 2-1 victory at West Ham last month, which kept the Hammers from moving one point behind.\n\nAnd, even when Nuno Espirito Santo's side beat Sunderland two weeks ago, Forest reacted with an impressive 2-0 win at Brentford 24 hours later.\n\nThose results were achieved, however, with a first-choice defence - and the absence of Matz Sels with a groin injury has been a huge loss too.\n\nIt was a gamble to replace last season's joint Golden Glove winner with John Victor in December and one which ultimately backfired, with Victor himself now also sidelined for the rest of the campaign.\n\nThat prompted Forest to bring in Stefan Ortega from Manchester City during the transfer window - but his debut against Leeds meant a defence which was so consistent last season was only changed further.\n\nZach Abbott was another debutant at Elland Road, the 19-year-old making his first Premier League appearance in the absence of injured defender Murillo.\n\nAbbott was targeted in the first half as Leeds seized on his inexperience - although Leeds' goals were ultimately down to a collective failure.\n\n\"We didn't get the injury news on Murillo until after training so we didn't get to work on anything else after that,\" said boss Sean Dyche.\n\n\"We just can't make basic errors like that. We didn't have a lot of time to work with the group at the back but we can't make basic errors.\n\n\"When we got here we were two points in the relegation zone and now we're six points out of it. I wasn't getting carried away beating Liverpool 3-0 and Tottenham 3-0 and people saying it was one of the best performances they've had in the Premier League.\n\n\"I knew if we won the work wasn't done. I look at if the work is done at the end of the season, not if we win or lose a game.\"\n\nThe full ramifications of yet another disappointing night for Nottingham Forest won't be known until Sunday evening.\n\nThe loss at Leeds will serve only to heighten concerns at the City Ground over the looming threat of relegation.\n\nWest Ham will cut Forest's cushion to three points with victory over Burnley on Saturday, while Crystal Palace and Tottenham can stretch their advantages over Dyche's side to six points by the time the weekend is out.\n\nYou wonder how the Forest hierarchy may react if the walls close in any more. Indeed, it is understood Dyche is under increasing pressure.\n\nLosing to a fellow relegation candidate in such a meek manner at Elland Road will not ease the internal scrutiny on Dyche's performance, with sources indicating support for the head coach isn't currently as solid as it has been.\n\nHaving already had three managers this season, it seems inconceivable that owner Evangelos Marinakis will seek a fourth head coach before the campaign is out.\n\nBut history tells us that the club's Greek owner has not been slow in making such decisions if he believes it is in Forest's best interests.\n\nThey now face bottom club Wolves on Wednesday at the City Ground. The home support will be expecting three points - but if Forest falter the pressure on Dyche will intensify.\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "fullText": "It is 10 years since Leicester City became the Premier League's most remarkable champions.\n\nThe Foxes, though, are in danger of marking the anniversary in the most inauspicious of ways with relegation.\n\nIt was on 2 May, 2016 that Leicester were mathematically confirmed as top-flight champions for the first time in their 142-year history.\n\nOn 2 May, 2026 they face Blackburn with their Championship status now in doubt after they were docked six points for breaching profit and sustainability (P&S) rules.\n\nThe punishment dragged them down to the edge of the relegation zone - kept out on goal difference alone.\n\nIt is a remarkable slide from glory which can be charted alongside battles against spending regulations.\n\nWith only one point from their last four games, supporters are starting to fear things could get worse at the King Power Stadium before they get better.\n\nRather than celebrate the title success a decade ago that defied belief, Leicester could be facing up to life in the third tier for the first time since the 2008-09 campaign.\n\nHow did the club end up here, and what could come next?\n\nFoxes should 'take medicine' and move on - Fryatt\n\nReaction to Foxes' points deduction on BBC Radio Leicester's When You're Smiling podcast\n\nThe Premier League triumph was just the start of a glory period for Leicester.\n\nThey also won the FA Cup for the only time in their history in 2021.\n\nThere was a season in the Champions League and two Europa League campaigns. In 2021-22 they lost to Roma in the semi-finals of the Conference League.\n\nBack-to-back eighth-placed finishes had the club's board believing, and spending like, this was now their natural place.\n\nJust 12 months after that defeat by Roma, Leicester were relegated.\n\n\"We tried to play with the big boys and we couldn't,\" Lynn Wyeth, chair of the Foxes' Trust, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It didn't fit our model. It didn't fit a club of our size. It didn't fit our budget.\n\n\"And then we've just had an absolute spiral downwards.\"\n\n'Lucky escape' or 'nonsensical' points deduction?\n\nLeicester spent just over £100m to sign six players across the 2021-22 and 2022-23 campaigns.\n\nIt was not just the transfer fees which were to cause issues, it was the salaries and the contracts.\n\nThe club's wage bill ballooned to £206m.\n\n\"Everybody assumed that they would be a top-eight club,\" Football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\n\"They effectively budgeted for that and didn't take into consideration the potential downside.\"\n\nMaguire said Leicester became \"a little bit complacent\" with contracts.\n\nPremier League player contracts would usually have clauses which would reduce a salary by between 30% or 50% upon relegation.\n\nIt is widely reported that, at the time, Leicester did not insert any.\n\n\"They had one bad season and they had no comeback in terms of relegation clauses and relegation avoidance clauses,\" added Maguire.\n\n\"It does seem that these contracts were awarded in such a way that they ignored the existential risk of relegation.\"\n\nIn the 2022-23 relegation season the club were spending 116% of their income on salaries.\n\nIt was then 102% in the 2023-24 season, and Maguire said the £107m wage bill was \"unprecedented for a second-tier football club\".\n\nLeicester may have won the Championship title in 2024, but it came at a cost. A huge cost.\n\nThe wage bill of the two other relegated teams was £84m for Leeds and £80m for Southampton. The Championship median average was £29m, said Maguire.\n\nWyeth said the Trust felt the budgets were \"incredibly risky\".\n\n\"There weren't enough safeguards in there for thinking what could go wrong,\" added Wyeth.\n\n\"We were all saying, what if we get relegated?\n\n\"The fans could see them walking into it.\"\n\nAfter promotion in 2024 the club still had to face up to financial issues.\n\nTrouble had already been signposted by a Profit and Sustainability rule (PSR) charge brought by the Premier League in March 2024. The club successfully appealed against that on a technicality over jurisdiction.\n\nThen the spending in the Championship was the catalyst for a breach of the PSR threshold by £20.8m, which led to the points deduction.\n\nBut there would be no stay in the Premier League to ease their plight as the Foxes went straight back down to the Championship last season, finishing 13 points adrift.\n\n\"They've relied on player sales to dig them out of a really messy situation,\" said Maguire. \"But if you keep selling your best players then that catches up with you.\"\n\nLeicester's battle against financial rules are well-documented. In 2018 the club had to pay the EFL £3.1m to settle a dispute from the 2013-14 season when the club won the Championship.\n\nThis time the punishment for their spending when winning the Championship was in points rather than pounds.\n\nKing Power International Group, which bought the club in 2010, continues to insist the club has done nothing wrong.\n\nReacting to the points deduction on Thursday, it said the punishment was \"disproportionate\" and \"does not adequately reflect the mitigating factors presented\".\n\nYet in the written reasons the commission rejected Leicester's claims they had shown \"exceptional co-operation\".\n\nLeicester's current owners have fought all financial charges at every turn, managing to cause multiple delays.\n\nIt could have been worse, too. One of the sanction mechanisms proposed by the Premier League would have resulted in a 12-point deduction.\n\n\"A lot of fans are saying do not appeal it,\" said Wyeth. \"For God's sake, stop fighting and admit you've messed up.\n\n\"Take the hit and knuckle down and get out of relegation trouble.\"\n\nWyeth fears the board has not learned from the lessons of the past and things could take another downturn.\n\n\"Every game you go to, you think it can't get any worse and then it does,\" she added. \"And that was before we got the points deduction.\"\n\nKey posts remain unfilled. Leicester have no manager after Marti Cifuentes was sacked after just six months in charge. There is no permanent chief executive and no technical director.\n\nWyth said fans were growing tired with \"a lack of transparency about accountability\" and protests were likely to increase.\n\nFans staged a boycott of last month's game against West Brom. The official attendance was 27,130 because all season ticket holders were included.\n\nThe Trust believes the true number was closer to 12,500.\n\n\"We've got the the King Power Out group picking up steam,\" said Wyeth.\n\n\"There are new kinds of protest groups, different protest groups coming together.\"\n\nLeicester have only played in the third tier of English football once in their history and were promoted as champions at the end of it 17 years ago.\n\nTen years to the day from Claudio Ranieri leading the Foxes to that fairytale Premier League success, they could be headed back to League One.\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "title": "'Why young British managers need lower-league experience'",
    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains why he thinks there is a negative reaction to British managers when they get jobs in the Premier League - and the path young coaches should take.",
    "fullText": "It has been interesting to witness the reaction of the media and some supporters at Chelsea over the past few weeks to the appointment of Liam Rosenior.\n\nBeing outside the game for a few years now, I have noticed a real trend of doubt and even negativity about any British managerial appointments by a top-flight club in this country.\n\nWith Liam, who I have known since he was a young player watching my training sessions at Bristol City more than 25 years ago, everything from his experience to his dress sense has been questioned, but his start to life at Chelsea has been exceptional with five wins in seven games.\n\nHis only defeats have come in both legs of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Arsenal.\n\nYes, that exit was a blow but let's remember Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has been in the job for more than six years and has produced, with some enormous financial backing and tremendous loyalty towards him by the club, a team that's one of - if not the best - in England and Europe.\n\nThat huge difference in their circumstances has not stopped Liam being criticised by some for his approach in those ties but he has spent almost a decade working his socks off to gain the experience that warrants this opportunity - and his experiences lower down the leagues and in Europe will have taught him the harshness of management and the reaction you get to every defeat.\n\nHis path is one I think more young British managers may need to pursue, in order to get a chance like he has.\n\nAs a former manager who worked at every professional level in England, you get to realise in the lower leagues what pressure you put yourself under, whether you are winning or losing.\n\nAlong with being able to ignore outside noise from the media outlets, one of my biggest assets was how I managed myself, on a day-to-day basis, and dealt with the stress of the job.\n\nLiam will need to do that tenfold at one of England's elite clubs, where scrutiny is so profound.\n\nLet's hope he gets the time and backing Arteta has received at Arsenal, because I believe it's vital to our national game that young British managers are given a chance by Premier League clubs, and if he succeeds then others can follow.\n\nThere are few other British bosses of any age in the Premier League at present - just six permanent bosses in total (far fewer than the number of 'home' managers in every other major league in Europe) - as well as Michael Carrick who is at Manchester United until the end of the season.\n\nOne of them, Eddie Howe, has proved at Newcastle without doubt that given, time and backing, British managers can be successful, and one day hopefully we will be applauding his appointment as the new England manager.\n\nAnd not far from Stamford Bridge, another young homegrown manager is showing his worth. Ireland's Keith Andrews was again not universally welcomed into the job at Brentford last summer, but just take a look at what he has achieved this season so far.\n\nIt is absolute necessary to our national game that, with the enormous amount of money spent, courses run and facilities produced, the young British or Irish coaches of today can relate to homegrown managers being successful at the top level, to give them the mentors to strive to follow and hopefully better.\n\nThe challenges today for coaches and players to do that are far greater, given that the Premier League is a world league.\n\nThis was never the case when I was growing up and then making my way as a manager. In the 1980s and 90s, English clubs were managed by British managers, Bob Paisley, Brian Clough, Alex Ferguson, Bobby Robson, Howard Kendall, Howard Wilkinson and George Graham. There were also great coaches like Don Howe and Dave Sexton too.\n\nAnd then there were the over-achievers like Bobby Gould at Wimbledon, John Sillett at Coventry and Lawrie McMenemy at Southampton, who all won the FA Cup with so-called smaller clubs.\n\nAt the same time, Martin O'Neill, Alan Curbishley and Peter Reid were breaking through, while John Toshack, Bobby Robson and Terry Venables were making new waves abroad. I apologise to the many other successful managers I haven't mentioned, but I only have so much room!\n\nAll these managers had different characters and approaches but what they have in common is that they were given the opportunity to prove their worth - something that is no longer the case for many British coaches and managers now.\n\nAt the end of the 1990's, Arsene Wenger, who was so prominent in opening the door to the influx of foreign managers in England, joined Arsenal.\n\nMany other top managers have followed - Mauricio Pochettino, Jose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola, Antonio Conte, Rafa Benitez and Claudio Ranieri are among the very best.\n\nThat in itself was purely a positive for our game and for myself personally too - I always believed in competition and to pit my wits against the above was a fantastic experience.\n\nThey were all fortunate to manage top clubs in England and become very successful doing it, while alongside these top managers arrived an array of fantastic players from all over the world.\n\nThe Premier League had more competition with managers arriving from abroad and also players coming in from all quarters of the world. It was imperative that the British coaches and players stepped up to the challenge, but right now it does not feel as if that is being allowed to happen.\n\nAlong with the success of foreign coaches came a belief that coaches from abroad were the only direction that owners - many of them being from abroad too - should go for.\n\nThis belief has, without a doubt affected the opportunities given to younger British coaches over the past decade and before, even if not all the foreign coaches arriving here matched the quality or success of the above.\n\nThe likes of Frank de Boer, Jacques Santini, Juande Ramos and Andre Villas Boas all struggled to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.\n\nMany more foreign coaches have arrived and brought with them tremendous success, but I do believe that our own young coaches given the opportunity could as Liam, Keith and Eddie have shown, be as successful given the chance - we should always judge managers on merit and not perception.\n\nAs I've mentioned in this column before, I always knew I wanted to stay in the game as a coach and manager after my playing days were over.\n\nI passed all my main coaching qualifications by the time I was 21, which allowed me to attend the managers and coaches' week at Lilleshall at the end of every season.\n\nIt was run by the Football Association, with regional coaches organising the programme for the week.\n\nNot only was I exposed to our elite coaches, but got to sit down and listen to the likes of Venables, Graham and Malcolm Allison talking over breakfast or dinner about the sessions being put on outdoors on the pitches.\n\nFor me, it was awe inspiring. These fantastic football people were devoted to the game we all love and I believed British coaches were at the top of the football world. They were fantastic mentors in so many ways.\n\nMy journey to eventually reaching the status of a Premier League manager started in the lower leagues, and I was fortunate to have been promoted out of every league.\n\nMy experience, my strengths and also my faults were all gained or worked on every week, in those surroundings.\n\nToday, academy football seems to be the new breeding ground for our young and up and coming coaches. Academy football is a great starting process on the ladder upwards, but I do believe these young coaches must experience the winning factor, outside of youth development and in lower league football.\n\nTo learn the difference, is imperative to their future success. Some outstanding managers played and coached in non-league and lower league surroundings and gained experience that was useful in more glamorous surroundings.\n\nJim Smith, Ron Atkinson, Dave Bassett and David Pleat, to name just a few, all earned their stripes lower down the leagues, before becoming top managers in England. It was the same more recently with Sam Allardyce, Harry Redknapp and Alan Pardew too.\n\nSome academy coaches have survived early baptisms when given their chances, but I believe the overall experiences lower down the pyramid cannot be matched.\n\nManaging in the academy is like shadow boxing, you don't get your supporters baying at you if you lose, you don't experience people above you questioning your selection or tactics, or players knocking your door about not playing or wanting to leave.\n\nI will always advise young players to get out and play in men's football if they can, because then you experience playing for a manager whose job is on the line if you don't play well, as well as paying crowds, criticism from the stands, the media and senior players.\n\nAcademy football can and does get bogged down with theory, when what these young coaches need is more practicality to understand real management situations.\n\nCoaching to develop is important, but when you are in the hot seat, no matter what level you are managing at, coaching to win is so much different.\n\nI really do hope that more British managers get opportunities to find that out in the Premier League and that gaining promotion out of the Championship will not be the only realistic route to achieving that dream.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League have confirmed the updated squad lists for the remainder of the 2025/26 season, with Arsenal making few changes to the senior squad list.\n\nWith no first-team signings in January, there was no one to add, though perhaps it’s worth noting that Mikel Merino remains on the list despite his long-term injury. So he’ll be eligible to play if and when he returns to fitness.\n\nOn the u21 list, Arsenal have added Evan Mooney and Jaden Dixon after their January moves from St. Mirren and Stoke City. So both will be eligible for Premier League action if called upon.\n\nThe good news with Mooney is that he’s joined before the end of the season in which he turned 18. That means if he spends the next three full seasons with Arsenal he’ll gain homegrown status, something he wasn’t eligible to get whilst playing in Scotland.\n\nIn the meantime, Mooney can be named in the unlimited u21 list, so he’ll never need to use up a non-homegrown senior squad spot.\n\nBack on the squad lists, Ethan Nwaneri has been named on Arsenal’s u21 list despite going out on loan. As mentioned, there’s no limit to the number of u21 players you can include, so there’s no negative consequence to leaving a player on there whilst on loan.\n\nMax Dowman isn’t included on the list, but he’s still eligible to play. The u21 list published by the Premier League only includes players on professional contracts and scholarship deals, and Dowman is still currently too young to begin his scholarship.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has urged fans to be patient with club-record signing Nick Woltemade now the rest of the Premier League is getting to know the German striker's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWoltemade made a fine start to his time in English football following his pre-season arrival from Stuttgart for a fee of £69 million ($94 million) with six goals in his first 11 games for northeast side Newcastle.\n\nBut the goals have dried up for the 23-year-old, who has failed to find the back of the net in his last 12 appearances\n\n\"He is young, (it's) a new league,\" Howe said of Woltemade in the build-up to Saturday's match at home to seventh-placed Brentford -- four positions above Newcastle in the table.\n\n\"He started so well and I think everybody expected that to continue but I think that is very difficult to do, as much as we wanted that to happen for him.\n\n\"He is getting to grips with the challenges of the Premier League -- the speed, the intensity and the physicality.\n\n\"And of course teams are getting to know him as well and I think that is the biggest challenge for him. Teams understand his game and what he wants to do so he has to find solutions the other way.\n\n\"You have to keep ahead of the other teams so there is work for him to do but I think he has done everything with such a great attitude and great way. That is the biggest thing for me he needs to do to be successful.\"\n\nNewcastle go into Saturday's match after the League Cup holders' defence of their first major domestic trophy in 70 years ended on Wednesday as Manchester City completed a 5-1 aggregate semi-final win.\n\nThat defeat at the Etihad Stadium led to intense social media speculation that the 48-year-old Howe had taken Newcastle as far as he can amid suggestions he could replace Thomas Tuchel as England manager after the World Cup.\n\nNewcastle, however, are just seven points off the top five and still involved in the Champions League -- they face Azerbaijani side Qarabag over two legs for a place in the last 16 later this month -- and the FA Cup.\n\nHowe, responding to all the commentary about his future at St James' Park, said: \"That's a surprise to me. I give my best to the football club every single day, to all the players and the staff. I try to be the best version of myself to inspire the team to win games.\n\n\"That's my only thought. I don't tend to look too far ahead, but I try to prepare and plan for the club to move forward in every sense. My individual future isn't really relevant.\n\n\"Who knows? I don't know my length of time here, I've got no idea. I just try to do my best every day until told differently.\"",

We can both laugh about it now.\"\n\nMilner is set to go level with Gareth Barry, who played 653 times, at the top of the all-time Premier League appearance list some 8,491 days after making his debut for hometown club Leeds United soon after leaving school in 2002.\n\n\"I think that will be a special thing for him but he is focused on top of that on the ambitions from the club as well. He wants to be always successful like he was his whole life,\" said Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler.\n\n\"He is a driver of this winning mentality and I think it's very important to have these kind of players in the squad.\n\n\"They know how to win, they know what it needs to win, how you need to prepare a game, how you react in bad phases like on bad runs we have at the moment.\"\n\nAlan Shearer, who played with Milner at Newcastle, describes him as a model professional and a \"manager's dream\".\n\n\"You would do well if you had him in your squad because you knew exactly what you were going to get,\" adds former England captain Shearer.\n\nThis is the story about a young lad from Leeds who evolved to set standards for hard work, professionalism and longevity - and earn respect from fans all over the world.\n\nMilner was just 16 and earning £70 a week as a YTS player when he broke into the first team at Leeds, six months after taking his GCSE exams.\n\nOn 10 November 2002, his dad Peter was in the away end at Upton Park when boss Terry Venables sent the youngster on for Jason Wilcox, now director of football at Manchester United, in the final minutes of a 4-3 win against West Ham.\n\nIt was a dream come true for Milner, who had grown up supporting the club and wore shirts with the names of Tony Yeboah and Tony Dorigo on the back.\n\nSix weeks after the West Ham game, Milner - aged 16 years and 356 days - became the youngest Premier League goalscorer at that time when he scored in a 2-1 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.\n\nIt was not enough to get the former Leeds season ticket-holder out of his post-match duties, however.\n\nBack then YTS players were expected to clean the dressing room after first-team games.\n\n\"Even when I was playing and scoring goals, after games I was helping the kit man pick dirty shirts off the dressing room floor,\" Milner told the High Performance podcast, external in 2023.\n\n\"I carried on cleaning the under-18 captain's boots. I was playing in the first team but he was still older than me.\"\n\nIt was not long, however, before Milner was sent on loan to the third tier of English football to continue his football education.\n\nSome 17-year-olds might have sulked at the prospect of swapping the glamour of the Premier League for games against Grimsby and Peterborough.\n\nMilner saw it as a chance to show what he was all about.\n\nDuring four weeks in Wiltshire, Milner played six games and scored two goals.\n\nSam Parkin, who was at Swindon at the same time as Milner, remembers a committed and hard-working teenager eager to learn.\n\n\"James was determined, driven and focused compared to some of the other young lads we had from Premier League clubs,\" recalls Parkin.\n\n\"He made a goal for me against Brighton at the Withdean Stadium and I remember us both scoring in a win against Peterborough.\"\n\nMilner describes his time in the lower leagues as a \"bit of an eye-opener\", with Swindon's players bringing their own pasta to eat on the team bus.\n\nYet he impressed with his attitude and performances, says Parkin.\n\n\"Before James went back to Leeds I told him: 'I never want to see you back here because you've got too much quality for this level',\" he adds.\n\nMilner returned to Elland Road where he became a first-team regular alongside the likes of Mark Viduka and Alan Smith.\n\nHe 'celebrated' his 18th birthday by playing in a 4-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal before relegation at the end of the 2003-04 season resulted in Leeds selling players to raise money.\n\nEngland forward Smith moved to Manchester United in a deal worth £7m, goalkeeper Paul Robinson went to Tottenham for £1.5m, while Milner signed for Newcastle in a deal worth £5m.\n\nNewcastle had just finished fifth in the Premier League, Sir Bobby Robson was manager and Shearer wore the captain's armband.\n\nIt was at Newcastle, however, that Milner would go on to experience one of the lowest moments of his career.\n\nShearer remembers Milner having a desire to learn and improve.\n\n\"He had a great mentality to get better, to be patient, but also to be frustrated and angry - you get that at times during your career.\"\n\nRobson lost his job four games into the 2004-05 season and was replaced by Graeme Souness, the former Liverpool and Scotland midfielder.\n\nA year after signing for Newcastle, Milner was sent out on loan to Premier League rivals Aston Villa.\n\nSouness defended his decision at the time saying \"you won't win the league with James Milners\". The remark, for which Souness has since apologised,, external stung the young winger, who would go on and win three Premier League titles.\n\nYet there was more turbulence ahead.\n\nMilner had impressed on loan at Villa so much that in September 2006 they offered around £4m to sign him permanently.\n\nNewcastle accepted and Milner travelled to the West Midlands only to learn upon arrival at Villa Park that the Magpies had pulled out of the deal at the 11th hour at the end of the transfer window.\n\nMilner was bitterly frustrated.\n\nIt would be another two years before he finally sealed a permanent switch to Villa at the age of 22 after 94 top-flight appearances for Newcastle.\n\nFor two seasons he played under Martin O'Neill before another move in 2010.\n\nChelsea had just won a Premier League and FA Cup double under Carlo Ancelotti and wanted to add Milner to their squad.\n\nManchester City were also keen. The trouble was, they had not won anything significant since 1976.\n\nIn the end he opted for the challenge of reviving City's fortunes.\n\nHe left five years later having helped them win two Premier League titles, one FA Cup, one League Cup and one Community Shield.\n\nMilner proved a versatile servant for both Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini, playing in a variety of positions including a stint as a lone striker - and he was popular in the dressing room.\n\n\"We won the Premier League together in 2012 but there were times that season when things were not going well,\" recalls former City defender Micah Richards.\n\n\"He was one of the people who kept everyone going.\"\n\nRichards developed a close bond with Milner but remembers getting the blame for the parody 'Boring James Milner' social media account, which mocked the player, often focusing on ironing, tea and trivial match details.\n\n\"Everyone thought I was behind it,\" says Richards.\n\n\"Whenever a new post went up Milner would say, 'Come on, mate, you've had your fun'. I'd be going, 'I swear, Millie, it's not me!'\n\n\"I ended up messaging the guy behind it, saying, 'Who is this because Milner thinks it's me?'\n\n\"He would not disclose his name but he sent me a picture of himself and it was just some random bloke. I just told him, 'Keep it up - I love it!'\"\n\nMilner played along with the 'boring' tag and during lockdown posted a video of himself cutting his lawn with scissors.\n\nAfter 147 top-flight appearances for City, he was ready for his next challenge.\n\nNext stop...Liverpool, where he won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Uefa Super Cup, Fifa Club World Cup and the Community Shield.\n\nIt was not all trophies and smiles, however, at Anfield.\n\nThere was that red card from his former teacher - and then the time he angered Klopp.\n\n\"One time at half-time he [Klopp] was sharing his thoughts and I was sharing mine,\" Milner adds on the High Performance podcast.\n\n\"I remember him smashing his hands down on the table and saying, 'Will you shut up'. But Jurgen was great, I had a great relationship with him.\"\n\nAfter Liverpool came an offer from Brighton in 2023 to prolong his top-flight career, where he continues to compete in what is his 24th Premier League season.\n\nMilner, who is eight years older than Seagulls boss Hurzeler, became the Premier League's second-oldest goalscorer behind Teddy Sheringham when he scored from the penalty spot against his former club Manchester City earlier this season.\n\nHe celebrated by recreating Diogo Jota's trademark video game controller celebration in tribute to his former Liverpool team-mate, who died in a car crash last July.\n\nMilner is wearing the No 20 shirt for Brighton, the same number Jota wore at Liverpool.\n\n\"I've not scored [in the Premier League] for six years and I was wearing his number. Obviously, I've got help from the great man,\" said an emotional Milner after the match.\n\nWhere does the player who represented England at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups rank on the list of all-time Premier League greats?\n\n\"Milner's name never really is mentioned as one of the greats, but he is, without a doubt,\" says Richards.\n\nFormer Leeds and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson, who played the night Milner made his debut at West Ham in 2002, said his former team-mate had dedicated his life to remain at the top level.\n\n\"It's everything you do, it's how you walk around at home, it's what shoes you wear, it's how you sleep, it's what pillows you sleep on, it's what you eat, it's what you put in your body,\" says Robinson.\n\n\"And for him to have evolved the way that the game's evolved as well, it's huge credit to himself as a person, not just a footballer, but as a person.\"\n\nWill Milner carry on playing when his contract expires in the summer? Having turned 40 in January, he treats every game as though it could be his last.\n\nHe still remembers a conversation with veteran Leeds goalkeeper Nigel Martyn soon after breaking into the first team 24 years ago.\n\n\"He told me, 'Enjoy it while you can because it goes so fast'. I said, 'Leave it out, Nige, I'm 16!'\n\n\"And here we are in the blink of an eye - and I'm where he was.\"\n\nMilner sent off by former PE teacher\n\nLatest Brighton news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Brighton - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Another pivotal Premier League gameweek awaits, with several sides locked in relegation battles and crucial clashes shaping the title race.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester City headline the round in a fixture that could significantly impact Arsenal’s advantage at the top.\n\nManchester United will look to continue their resurgence under interim boss Michael Carrick, while Spurs aim to halt their inconsistency.\n\nAt the bottom end, multiple six-pointers offer teams a chance to create daylight between themselves and the drop zone. With form fluctuating across the table, this gameweek promises tension, drama, and fine margins.\n\nLeeds will be hopeful of delivering a much-improved performance after a disappointing 4–0 defeat to Arsenal last week.\n\nThe Whites must be sharper in front of goal and defensively disciplined if they are to get a result against Nottingham Forest.\n\nForest were unable to capitalise against an out-of-sorts Crystal Palace side dealing with off-field issues.\n\nWith both teams level on 26 points, this clash represents a potential six-pointer in the relegation battle and should make for a tense encounter.\n\nJaka Bijol and Lukas Nmecha are doubts for Leeds, while Anton Stach is ruled out. James Justin has made a full recovery and is expected to be available.\n\nFor Forest, Matz Sels and Callum Hudson-Odoi are doubts, while Neco Williams is suspended.\n\nA last-minute strike from Benjamin Šeško earned Manchester United their third consecutive win since Michael Carrick took charge as interim manager.\n\nThe Red Devils have found their rhythm in attack while maintaining defensive discipline, making them favourites to extend their unbeaten run to six matches when Spurs visit Old Trafford.\n\nTottenham showed resilience by coming back from two goals down against Manchester City last week. Improved second-half performances saw Dominic Solanke score twice to rescue a point.\n\nThat level of intensity will be required again if Spurs are to trouble Carrick’s side.\n\nMicky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, and Dominic Solanke have all been passed fit, while Djed Spence is a doubt.\n\nArsenal will be keen to secure all three points after an entertaining draw in the reverse fixture at the Stadium of Light.\n\nThe Gunners returned to winning ways by dismantling Leeds last week, extending their lead at the top of the table to six points.\n\nThey also booked their place in the League Cup final by completing a semi-final double over Chelsea at the Emirates.\n\nSunderland picked up an important victory against Burnley last week to move back into the top half of the table. It was just the Black Cats’ second win in five games.\n\nMartin Ødegaard is a doubt for Arsenal, while Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino are ruled out through injury.\n\nBournemouth secured a routine 2–0 win over Wolves last week, making it three wins in their last four matches and four games unbeaten.\n\nThe Cherries appear to have adjusted well following Antoine Semenyo’s departure.\n\nAston Villa, meanwhile, were frustrated in a goalless draw against 10-man Brentford despite playing with a numerical advantage from the 42nd minute.\n\nThe dropped points saw Villa fall one point behind second-placed Manchester City and seven behind leaders Arsenal. David Brooks is a doubt for Bournemouth, while Ollie Watkins is a doubt for Villa.\n\nThis is a clash between 18th and 19th on the league table. Burnley failed to extend their unbeaten run to four matches after a tepid 3–0 defeat to Sunderland.\n\nThe Clarets’ performance was disappointing, and Scott Parker will demand a significant response.\n\nWest Ham suffered a second-half collapse last week, surrendering a two-goal lead against Chelsea.\n\nDespite that setback, the Hammers come into this clash as slight favourites based on recent performances. Jean-Clair Todibo remains suspended.\n\nFulham’s defensive frailties were exposed last week when Manchester United snatched all three points courtesy of a last-minute Šeško winner.\n\nPrior to that goal, the Cottagers had shown resilience by fighting back from two goals down to level the match deep into stoppage time.\n\nUnlike Fulham, Everton were beneficiaries of late drama, with Beto scoring in the 97th minute to rescue a point against Brighton.\n\nThe result extended the Toffees’ unbeaten run to four games and lifted them into the top half of the table.\n\nWolves’ brief resurgence has come to an abrupt end following back-to-back defeats.\n\nRob Edwards’ side looked devoid of ideas in their loss to Bournemouth and could face a tough afternoon when Chelsea visit Molineux. Ladislav Krejčí is a slight doubt.\n\nChelsea will be eager to bounce back from their League Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal.\n\nThe Blues have won their last three league matches, with Enzo Fernández and João Pedro shouldering the attacking burden.\n\nFilip Jørgensen, Reece James, and Pedro Neto are doubts, while Jamie Gittens is ruled out long-term with a hamstring injury.\n\nNewcastle exited the League Cup after a heavy 5–1 aggregate defeat to Manchester City.\n\nThe Magpies have also struggled in the league, failing to win any of their last three matches, and European qualification now looks unlikely.\n\nBruno Guimarães and Lewis Miley are doubts, while Anthony Gordon is ruled out with a hamstring injury.\n\nBrentford showed immense resilience to secure a 1–0 win over Aston Villa despite playing more than half the match with ten men. The victory moved the Bees to within five points of fourth-placed Manchester United.\n\nBrighton will be without Yasin Ayari due to a shoulder injury, but Diego Gómez has been passed fit.\n\nThe Seagulls were denied victory by a late Everton equaliser last week, extending their winless run to four matches.\n\nCrystal Palace earned just their second point in five games with a 1–1 draw against Nottingham Forest.\n\nOngoing off-field issues appear to be affecting performances, with the Eagles now sitting 15th, nine points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nLiverpool host Manchester City in the standout fixture of the gameweek at Anfield.\n\nThe Reds will be seeking revenge after a 3–0 defeat in the reverse fixture and will take confidence from their emphatic 4–1 win over Newcastle last week.\n\nJeremie Frimpong remains sidelined, while Joe Gomez faces a late fitness test.\n\nManchester City need a win to keep pace with Arsenal in the title race. Pep Guardiola’s side have won just one of their last five league matches and now sit six points behind the leaders.\n\nA second-half collapse against Spurs last week highlighted recent inconsistencies. Rúben Dias is ruled out, while Bernardo Silva is a doubt.",

    "fullText": "Having won only one of their past six Premier League games and drawn 2-2 at Tottenham after being 2-0 up, can second-placed Manchester City get back on track at Liverpool on Sunday?\n\n\"I wouldn't rule City out of anything at the moment\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\n\"But the way they folded in the second half against Tottenham was a real worry.\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 25 is Gladiators star Apollo, real name Alex Gray, who supports Newcastle.\n\nBefore becoming a Gladiator, the 6ft 6in Gray played Premiership rugby for three teams and also American Football for NFL side Atlanta Falcons.\n\nHe is part of Channel 5's Big Game Night NFL coverage and they are live on Super Bowl Sunday on 8 February from 22:30 GMT.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own Premier League predictions below - and for the Super Bowl too!\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nThe NFL's influence can be seen in the Premier League through the kind of choreographed corner routines that are now commonplace, and Apollo can understand why Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has shared ideas with Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay.\n\nApollo told BBC Sport: \"While football is quite a free-flowing game you do have these set-pieces and if you need some inspiration of how to make things happen then the NFL is a good place to look at, because that's what they do all day every day - not just on offence but on defence as well.\n\n\"What you are always trying to get in the NFL is mismatches, and that's exactly the same in football for some of the big guys coming in and trying to put the ball in the back of the net with a header or whatever.\n\n\"The level of detail that goes into that in the NFL is incredible. I remember my days there in training camp would start with breakfast at 7.30am and some days you wouldn't leave the meeting rooms until 11pm.\n\n\"We were only on the field for two hours max and in the gym for another hour, and the rest would be meetings and analysis.\n\n\"The scrutiny on every individual is so high so I can see why other sports would look at that and try to implement it themselves to find some weakness in the opposition armour. Arteta must have been thinking it is a way to help his team win games.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Apollo - aka Alex Gray - were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.\n\nI am at this game and we are getting to the stage where it really matters how the teams fighting relegation do in their head-to-head-battles like this.\n\nI think the bottom two, Wolves and Burnley are down, but you don't know what West Ham will do from here.\n\nThere are signs they may click, so with Leeds and Nottingham Forest both on 26 points, this is big for both of them.\n\nFrom a Leeds point of view, their home form has carried them a lot this season.\n\nThey got walloped at Elland Road by Arsenal last weekend but they just have to put that behind them for this game because, as the season has gone on, they have proved they can be competitive.\n\nForest's away form is actually better than their home form - they have picked up 14 points on the road compared to 12 at the City Ground, in the same number of games.\n\nSean Dyche's side were comfortable with 10 men in the draw against Crystal Palace last time out and they have won their past two away games, against Brentford and the Hammers. Overall, they are unbeaten in four league games, which is the longest they have gone without losing all season.\n\nAs you can see, I've looked into all the stats for you - but will my research help me get my prediction right? Probably not.\n\nThis is going to be a very tight affair and Forest won't worry about having much possession, but scoring goals has been a bigger problem for them because they have missed Chris Wood badly - only Wolves have scored fewer than them.\n\nForest have brought in 6ft 7in striker Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli to try to fill the gap left by Wood's long-term knee injury but he has not been in great form in Serie A this season.\n\nSo, after a great deal of thought, I am going to back Leeds at home - although now I've said that it will probably end up as a 1-1 draw.\n\nApollo's prediction: When I looked at the fixtures I was thinking about who in the Gladiators supports who. Two of the guys, Giant and Hammer, are big Forest fans so I am going for a Leeds win here. It should be a good game though. 3-2\n\nManchester United were slightly fortunate to beat Fulham last time out. A draw would have been about right.\n\nStill, it was big for Benjamin Sesko to get their winner and I have got to say he put it away very nicely, especially because he should have scored with a header earlier in the game.\n\nTottenham, meanwhile, produced a great comeback against Manchester City. I've talked about how much I rate Dominic Solanke and when he is up for Spurs, they are in a much better place as a team.\n\nThere is a danger of getting carried away with United under Michael Carrick, and I am expecting Solanke to score again here, but it still feels like United will find a way to win it.\n\nApollo's prediction: Tottenham have an affinity with the NFL and I've been to a couple of games there so I am backing them here. 0-1\n\nLosing back-to-back home league games against Everton and Brentford has been a real killer for Aston Villa, who have so many injuries to contend with in their midfield.\n\nAfter a long wait for a win, Bournemouth have now won three of their past four league games - and I make them favourites at home here.\n\nVilla thumped the Cherries 4-0 at Villa Park in November, and I have got a lot of their players in my Fantasy team, but this is going to be a very different game.\n\nI've gone for 2-1 wins in my first two games and I don't really want to go for that scoreline again here, but I feel like I have no choice. I do think Villa will score - Morgan Rogers is always dangerous and Tammy Abraham is a clever signing up front - but Bournemouth will edge it.\n\nApollo's prediction: It's great for Villa to be in a title race. 1-2\n\nI am not going to say 2-1 for this one. Instead it will be another Arsenal clean sheet - they have already kept 12 in their first 24 league games, two more than any other team.\n\nIt's a shame Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka is not fit to face his old club at the Emirates. When he played for the Black Cats against Arsenal in their draw at the Stadium of Light, they were the first team I saw who really rattled the Gunners.\n\nXhaka's experience has helped to glue together a Sunderland side with a lot of young players this season, but they coped all right without him against Burnley on Monday.\n\nThis is a much tougher game for them, obviously, and Sunderland's away form is nowhere near as strong as it is at home.\n\nArsenal swept Leeds aside 4-0 last weekend, when everyone thought they were having a bit of a blip.\n\nThey showed their strength in depth at Elland Road, when they lost Bukayo Saka in the warm-up, and I can see them winning comfortably this time too.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is very easy for me because Legend and Fire both support Arsenal and are real die-hard fans - Legend even has a cannon tattoo - so being absolutely honest I would love Sunderland to win, and do it for the north-east! 0-2\n\nI think Burnley are down but this is their chance to prove me wrong.\n\nThey need it to be - they are at home, against a team one place above them in the table, so this is their big chance to end their long wait for a win.\n\nI just don't see it happening for the Clarets, though.\n\nAs I said earlier, I am not sure which West Ham side will turn up but they have shown some improvement recently, especially in attack.\n\nI don't think the Hammers will keep a clean sheet because they have had only one all season - the fewest by any top-flight team - but I don't see Burnley beating them.\n\nApollo's prediction: My cousins are lifelong Burnley fans and season-ticket holders so if I didn't back them here, I'd be in a lot of trouble. The former NFL player, JJ Watt, is a co-owner of the club too, so for the NFL links and family ties, it's got to be a home win. 2-1\n\nEverton asked about Fulham forward Harry Wilson on deadline day.\n\nHe has been a revelation this season and they won't be looking forward to facing him on Saturday.\n\nThe Toffees have got something after falling behind in their past three league games, including the last-gasp equaliser against Brighton that saw poor David Moyes booked for his celebration - there is no way you should get a yellow card for that.\n\nThis is going to be another close game and it smells of another 2-1 to me, but I am not going to go down that road again this week.\n\nInstead, I'm going for a different scoreline but sticking with a narrow Fulham win. Marco Silva will feel his side deserved something from Old Trafford and it will be him celebrating at the final whistle this week, not Moyes.\n\nApollo's prediction: We don't like draws in the NFL but this might up all-square. 1-1\n\nChelsea were accused of being too negative in their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal in midweek, but I can't see that being the case here.\n\nI was far too optimistic about Wolves last week when I said they would draw with Bournemouth and I am not making the same mistake this time.\n\nThe games have been coming thick and fast for Chelsea and I actually admire their manager Liam Rosenior for the way he changed things up in their 3-2 comeback win over West Ham after being 2-0 down.\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards has probably got one eye on preparing for next season in the Championship, and his side will be one step nearer to that after this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: I went to a couple of Chelsea games when I lived in London and they will get the job done here. 1-2\n\nYou just wonder how much Newcastle have got left in the tank after their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat at Manchester City on Wednesday.\n\nThe Magpies have a few injuries to contend with too, with Anthony Gordon the latest player to be sidelined, so they will have to dig deep and hope Bruno Guimaraes is back fit in time for this game.\n\nBrentford got one heck of a win last time out at Villa, and their manager Keith Andrews deserves a lot of credit for getting that result despite being down to 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nThe Bees are always so well organised at the back, and how Eddie Howe's side try to break them down will be the key to this one.\n\nAs good as Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade is with his back to goal, he doesn't run in behind.\n\nDoing that, and attacking with pace, is how Eddie Howe's side look the most dangerous - Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga will have to do that here, and I fancy Yoane Wissa to score against his former club.\n\nApollo on why he supports Newcastle: I am from a small town in County Durham - my grandmother went to school with Sir Bobby Robson - so I had the choice of Newcastle, Sunderland or Middlesbrough. I know it is absolute blasphemy to say this, but I like to see all the north-east clubs do well.\n\nNewcastle are my team though, because that's who I went to watch first - I went to see them against Ipswich in 2000, and Alan Shearer scored a couple - and it is my city as well. I played rugby for them and I lived there. It's a fantastic place and it's even better when the team is going well.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is going to be a Newcastle win, it's just a case of how much. Brentford's performance coach Ben Ryan used to coach me for England Sevens, then he went to Fiji and got a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, so it would be nice to get one over him as well. 3-1\n\nPalace have brought in Jorgen Strand Larsen, and kept Jean-Philippe Mateta, so Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has got some options up front.\n\nI normally predict a draw in this game, and it ended up 0-0 at Selhurst Park in November. This time, though, I fancy Brighton.\n\nThe Seagulls didn't quite get over the line against Everton, but them conceding late on actually won me some points. I am going for them to keep a clean sheet here though.\n\nApollo's prediction: Palace to edge it. 0-1\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola starts with Omar Marmoush up front ahead of Erling Haaland after his two goals against Newcastle in midweek, but their attack looks strong anyway with Rayan Cherki and Antoine Semenyo in the team.\n\nThe same applies to Liverpool, who have got a striker in form in Hugo Ekitike, while Florian Wirtz is playing with confidence too.\n\nCity will have moments where they will create chances, but Liverpool are going to have opportunities at the other end as well - there will be a few goals in this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is the 'Super Bowl' game of the weekend in the Premier League so I've gone for an NFL-type score as well as a football one. 22-31 (2-3)\n\nSuper Bowl, Levi's Stadium 23:30 GMT\n\nI haven't got a clue about the NFL and I never played gridiron - my nose would be too big and would stick out of the helmet - but I am going for the Seahawks to down the Patriots on Sunday.\n\nSeattle is a really nice place and I played in their stadium for Celtic, so they get my backing here... although that's probably bad news for them, going by how I've done at predictions this season.\n\nApollo's prediction: The Seahawks' defensive coordinator, Aden Durde, was part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program that took me to Atlanta. If he gets a Super Bowl, it would be the biggest accomplishment from someone from Britain in the NFL. 21-18\n\nFor the second successive week, the outcome went to the final game.\n\nChris, the BBC readers and AI were all level on 80 points going into Monday's match between Sunderland and Burnley, with his guest - boxer Francesca Hennessy - on 40 points.\n\nChris and Francesca went for a 1-0 Black Cats victory, the BBC readers thought they would win 2-0, while AI picked a 1-1 draw.\n\nSunderland were 2-0 up after 32 minutes but the BBC readers' hopes of an outright win were scuppered when Chemsdine Talbi scored their third goal, 18 minutes from time.\n\nThat meant Chris and the BBC readers tied for victory - they both managed six correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 matches in week 24, for a total of 90 points.\n\nAI managed five correct results with one correct score for a tally of 80 points, while Francesca also managed five correct results but with no exact scores, leaving her on 50 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.\n\nPlayers earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.\n\nThe top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.\n\nIf players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.\n\nThursday, 12 February - FAS Dome, Antwerp\n\nQuarter-finals (from 19:15 GMT)\n\nJonny Clayton v Stephen Bunting",

A victory will be huge for the Gunners as they look to win the Premier League title, but manager Mikel Arteta could have fresh injury concerns. Arsenal had an open training this morning and the trio of Jurrien Timber, Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard were not involved, according to Sky Sports.\n\nWhile Saka missed the game against Chelsea on Tuesday due to a knock he picked up shortly before kick-off against Leeds United last Saturday, Timber played the whole game and Arsenal fans could be worried about his fitness. Odegaard was left out of the Gunners’ squad for their Carabao Cup semi-final as a precaution, and it remains to be seen whether he will return to training ahead of the weekend.\n\nThe Norwegian featured against Leeds, coming off the bench to play 29 minutes. Arsenal need their key players against Sunderland and Arteta will be hoping for some good news on the fitness of the aforementioned trio. He admitted that Odegaard felt a niggle during the Leeds game and was not feeling comfortable on Monday.\n\nThe Arsenal skipper will be desperate to be available for the weekend after he was started on the bench against the Whites.",

    "description": "“Neil and Patterson delivered Sunderland back to the Premier League, and in doing so helped usher in an era that ultimately moved beyond them”, writes James Hunter.",
    "fullText": "Wembley Stadium, 4:59pm on 24 May 2025, was a seismic moment.\n\nWho can forget Tommy Watson’s 95th-minute winner against Sheffield United in the Championship play-off final?\n\nIt ended Sunderland’s eight-year wait for a long-overdue return to the Premier League and set the stage for the magnificent season Régis Le Bris and his side are currently enjoying.\n\nEight months on, the aftershocks of that day — and the paradigm shift it triggered — continue.\n\nI write, of course, in the wake of the departures of Dan Neil and Anthony Patterson, two of Sunderland’s Wembley heroes and mainstays of that promotion-winning side.\n\nMidfielder Neil started all but two league games last season — one of those absences due to suspension — while goalkeeper Patterson started all but four. Both also started all three play-off games.\n\nBut promotion changes everything. It always does.\n\nAnd with Sunderland stepping up a level, the summer was spent building a squad fit to compete in the top flight — a process that left Neil and Patterson among those squeezed out.\n\nSunderland fans loved seeing homegrown stars Neil and Patterson thrive last season, and they would have been thrilled to watch them test themselves in the Premier League.\n\nInstead, Patterson departed without making a top-flight appearance, linking up on loan with former Sunderland boss Alex Neil at Millwall for the remainder of the season. Dan Neil’s involvement on Wearside, meanwhile, was restricted to three substitute outings totalling just 13 minutes before he joined Ipswich Town on loan to play out the final months of his contract.\n\nSentiment is a fine thing, but there is little room for it in the upper echelons of professional sport.\n\nFor all Patterson’s undoubted ability, Sunderland upgraded last summer with the signing of Robin Roefs, while the arrival of Melker Ellborg earlier this year cleared the path for his departure.\n\nAnd while Neil was one of the first names on the teamsheet in the Championship, the equation changes when players of the calibre of Granit Xhaka, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra arrive at the club.\n\nSunderland are moving onwards and upwards, and with that progress comes inevitable change.\n\nNeil and Patterson are simply too good to become perennial substitutes or bit-part Premier League players.\n\nBetter, then, that both have joined clubs competing for play-off places — and perhaps more — at the sharp end of the Championship.\n\nTheir roles in Sunderland’s rise cannot be overstated.\n\nFor Neil, captaining his boyhood club to Wembley glory was the stuff of childhood dreams. And the image of him and fellow Black Cats fan Patterson lifting the play-off trophy together is one that will live long in the memory.\n\nBut Wembley was both a summit and a turning point. Neil and Patterson delivered Sunderland back to the Premier League, and in doing so helped usher in an era that ultimately moved beyond them. That is not failure or rejection, but the price of progress — and one Sunderland can afford to pay because of what they gave.\n\nFollow James Hunter over on X by clicking here!",

    "description": "This is a team which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",
    "fullText": "Monday’s convincing victory over Burnley has virtually guaranteed Sunderland’s Premier League status for next season, with more than a third of fixtures still to play.\n\nIt was also the sixth occasion where the squad has responded to a defeat with a win — that speaks to the mentality of the group of players who have been blended together from last season’s promotion-winning heroes and the carefully selected cohort of summer recruits.\n\nThe ability to bounce back after disappointing performances against the likes of Burnley in August, Manchester United in October and West Ham in January is testament to the belief that Régis Le Bris has instilled in what has proved to be the surprise package of the season.\n\nIt is not just the fact that this is a team full of talented players which gives the squad character. It is that the club have recruited talented players who have the right character to play for this club, and for this coach.\n\nFor a goalkeeper of his age and experience, Robin Roefs should not have the calm temperament to control his area in the manner that he does. Ahead of him, he has Nordi Mukiele whose will to win is demonstrated, not only by his galloping forays down the wing, but by his willingness to put his body on the line. Dan Ballard embodies the ‘Til the end’ mentality that dragged this team back to the Premier League, Omar Alderete has the ice-cool mentality and ruggedness of a South American gangster, and Reinildo wanders round the Academy of Light in January in a sleeveless vest, as if he was back in Mozambique.\n\nTrai Hume has continued to deliver the kind of no-nonsense, hard-as-nails performances that make his price tag the steal of the century, while Granit Xhaka patrols the midfield with the mindset of a military commander determined to deliver victory on the battlefield.\n\nBeside him, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra bring an African energy, skill, enthusiasm and joy that we haven’t seen since the days of Asamoah Gyan, while Enzo Le Fée’s creativity is only matched by his never-say-die attitude to win back the ball every single time the team loses possession.\n\nUp front, Brian Brobbey is delivering the kind of no-nonsense muscular front-man performances that the Sunderland faithful have been desperately seeking for years, shrugging off defenders like annoying flies. On the wing, Chemsdine Talbi not only grafts back defensively but has delivered the spectacular finishes that excite crowds.\n\nAdd to that the loveable Wilson Isidor, Wembley hero Eliezer Mayenda and ‘Mr Sunderland’ Luke O’Nien, and this is a group of players who deserve to be celebrated.\n\nAfter years of watching the likes of Jack Rodwell and others stealing a living from the club, and giving nothing for the badge, let alone everything, this is such a refreshing change. And that is why the fact that the club has only recruited three new players in January should not be a concern.\n\nThe recruitment team have set out their stall. If you want to play for Sunderland, the first question is ‘Are you talented enough?’ If the answer to that is ‘Yes’, the next question is ‘Are you the right type of player, do you have the right mentality?’\n\nRecruiting players who can answer ‘Yes’ to those questions is precisely why we can now spend the last third of the season worrying about how high this squad might finish in the Premier League, rather than whether we will still be in it in August.\n\nLook around at other sides who have prioritised ability over attitude, who have put together a group of players, rather than a team. It is the same approach that allowed Leicester City to achieve the improbable, if not the impossible, by winning the Premier League a decade ago.\n\nThis is a team — the only team unbeaten at home in the Premier League — which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",

The weather conditions were so bad the deadline had to be postponed for 24 hours.\n\nRemember 2013, when West Brom striker Peter Odemwingie got in his car and drove 120 miles from Birmingham to London in the forlorn hope he would sign for Queens Park Rangers.\n\nAnd 2011 produced the greatest winter deadline day of all. Liverpool made the shock signing of Andy Carroll from Newcastle, alongside Luis Suarez from Ajax.\n\nSince then the window has had its moments, but the final day itself has been something of a damp squib.\n\nThe Premier League had its quietest ever winter transfer deadline day on Monday, with just seven deals completed.\n\nYet deadline day has not been packed for a while. In 2024 we saw 13 deals done, then 16 in 2023 and in 2022 it was 14.\n\nThe drama of deadline day has always been something of a quiet affair across the other top leagues.

    "fullText": "The transfers of Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz were two of the biggest in Liverpool's history.\n\nThe duo were seen as the best way for Liverpool to take their next step and to even replace Mohamed Salah in the future.\n\nAnd, while Wirtz is finally getting back to his best, it's clear that some new signings still need to be made at Liverpool.\n\nThis has caused plenty of confusion among the football world, with Paul Merson now slamming the recruitment process undertaken by Hughes.\n\n\"With all the money Liverpool have spent, the squad looks wafer-thin,\" Merson told Sky Sports in quotes relayed by The Mirror.\n\n\"Looking at it now, they got it horribly wrong in the summer.\n\n\"By going bang, bang with a load of attackers and thinking they were going to dominate English football for the next four or five years, it's backfired.\"\n\nEven though attackers were needed to replace Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz at Liverpool, they still spent far too much money.\n\nIsak and Wirtz alone cost the Anfield outfit around £240 million, which, for any team is a massive chunk of change.\n\nThe Reds have often spent their money wisely and have chosen to upgrade multiple areas of their squad, rather than splashing the cash in one place.\n\nAlthough the chances of a new player arriving before January's deadline day look slim, that doesn't mean that they can't eye up potential targets for the 2026-27 summer window.\n\nHowever, if Hughes, Slot and Edwards do end up drafting up a shortlist of potential targets, they must ensure that their entire squad is benefitting, rather than just one area of it.\n\nOtherwise, they could end up in the same situation all over again next year.",

They've slotted in really well, which is testament to them.\"\n\nCrystal Palace's deadline day move for Strand Larsen meant they spent £83m in the winter window, having signed Brennan Johnson for £35m from Tottenham.\n\nAston Villa - who are third - were the only other top-six side to pay out transfer fees during the winter window. They spent £18.25m on bringing back striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas and £10.5m on winger Alysson from Gremio.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal did no business during the winter window, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool - fourth, fifth and sixth respectively - also quiet.\n\nWhile Manchester City spent money to bolster their squad for a title fight, at the other end of the table West Ham splashed out in a bid to avoid relegation to the Championship.\n\nThe Hammers, who are third from bottom and six points adrift of safety, spent a reported £21.8m on Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente and around £25m on striker Taty Castellanos from Lazio.\n\nTottenham, who are 14th, spent £35m on signing midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid, while Bournemouth used some of their money from the Semenyo sale to sign teenage striker Rayan from Vasco da Gama for £24.7m and Hungary midfielder Alex Toth for £10.4m from Ferencvaros.\n\nDespite a quiet deadline day, Premier League clubs still spent more overall in the winter window than sides in other major European leagues.\n\nThe next-biggest spending league was Serie A, with their clubs paying out a combined £205m in transfer fees.\n\nSassuolo were one of the most active Italian clubs, paying £22m for Marseille duo Ismael Kone and Darryl Bakola.\n\nIn Spain, the transfer window closed at 22:59 GMT, but La Liga business was quiet, with Atletico Madrid's £30m deal for Ademola Lookman more than was spent be the rest of the division's clubs combined (£20.3m).\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

All that's left is to thank all of you for being there and for always supporting us, the fans.\"\n\nSpurs signed Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid and 19-year-old Brazilian defender Souza from Santos in the January window.\n\nThey added 18-year-old Hearts forward James Wilson on loan on transfer deadline day, but he will be part of their under-21s squad.\n\nIn response to Romero's post last month, manager Thomas Frank said the 27-year-old Argentina centre-back should keep some things \"internal\".\n\nTottenham wanted to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo in January but he joined Manchester City instead, with Frank saying on Friday the club \"did everything\" they could.\n\n\"The fans just want the best for the club, just like I, the owners, the staff, the players. Everyone wants the best for the club,\" added the Dane.\n\n\"But the transfer window is not Football Manager, unfortunately. It is not. It would be a lot easier, but also a little bit more boring.\"\n\nSpurs, who won the Europa League last term, are currently 14th in the Premier League and sit closer to the drop zone than the European qualification places, although they have made it to the last 16 of the Champions League.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): Ten men away at Aston Villa, I could have put the whole backline in. Keller has gone in and not only held his own as their number one, but continued to showcase probably why he left Liverpool. A lot of people would have said 'stay, Alisson is getting older, you'll get your chance'. He didn't, he went away and he has been fantastic for them and it is a team that suits him.\n\nMarcos Senesi (Bournemouth): Arguably one of the players of the season for me. He is really solid, goes about his business, gets everything done. Nothing is forced.\n\nGabriel (Arsenal): Leeds weren't poor, but Gabriel was solid and reassuring. He got the job done and knows the threat he poses from set-pieces. It was probably his best defensive display of the season.\n\nKristoffer Ajer (Brentford): Big, solid defender. He was celebrating making tackles in the first few minutes, which is not my cup of tea, but when you are doing it consistently all the way through and putting your body on the line, I'll give you a pass.\n\nEnzo Fernandez (Chelsea): Obviously he scored the goal that completed the great comeback. He gets a lot of stick, unjustifiably in my opinion. People don't think he's that good and maybe it's the price tag and because he won a World Cup that means they expect more. He is a good midfielder and a really good captain, and he looks after the ball when they are in difficult moments.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): I have been saying for weeks and months that with a player of that quality, it was only a matter of time before he settled into it. These past six weeks we have seen the real Florian Wirtz - dictating games, his passing range is unbelievable. The goals and assists have started to come now and he is looking really strong.\n\nAlex Scott (Bournemouth): It was a tough day for him because Wolves were decent. He has had a tough time after going away with England but has come back and has found his mojo. It's going to be an interesting back end of the season for him trying to make the World Cup squad.\n\nNoni Madueke (Arsenal): From thinking you are on the bench to finding out you are starting less than five minutes before kick-off is a massive turn of events. To be mentally focused to deliver, that is credit to Mikel Arteta and Madueke. They somehow gave the goal to him even though it was an own goal, but with a goal and assist he gets in the team.\n\nHabib Diarra (Sunderland): It says a goal and an own goal, but it's basically two goals for him. He was exceptional. The wide players absolutely killed Burnley and he was at the heart of it.\n\nDominic Solanke (Tottenham): It was probably the weirdest two goals he will score in his life. The first one is questionable but the second one is pure genius. To not only backheel it but to lob Gianluigi Donnarumma who is 6ft 6in is unbelievable. It is great to see him back playing. Can he have a late push now for the England squad? That is the question if he can stay fit.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Signing of the season? Probably. Another two goals and he looks like he is going from strength to strength, week by week. It's going to be really difficult for Alexander Isak to get back in.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a wonderful away performance at Elland Road. With Bukayo Saka getting injured in the warm-up there could have been excuses, but he didn't make any. He put Noni Madueke in and he returned the favour. It was a wonderful performance at a place where teams have struggled.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

Two, three and, in one case, four minutes.\n\nProfessional Match Game Officials (PMGO) insists that over the past couple of seasons VAR reviews are getting quicker.\n\nBut with extended stoppages, especially when they happen in clusters on one day, the fans' lived experience is very different.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there,\" Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"To wait that long is frustrating for everyone watching the game and I think everyone who loves football, generally, feels the frustration. But what can we do?\"\n\nA time limit on VAR checks and reviews has been suggested whenever there has been a day of interminable delays.\n\nBBC Sport understands that at no point has it been seriously considered by Fifa or the International Football Association Board (Ifab).\n\nBut could it actually work?

    "fullText": "When does the January transfer window close? Key dates for Premier League, European big five in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe January transfer window allows clubs across Europe to add mid-season reinforcements and make alterations as a reaction to their current positioning and squad health.\n\nSome clubs may wish to add players due to injuries, poor performance, or a strong first half of the campaign, which has positioned them to achieve more than they expected.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, may wish to move on from disgruntled players or get some cash for those who are slated to leave in the summer for free.\n\nThe Sporting News brings you a roundup of when the transfer window opens and closes across the major European leagues, who have come together in recent years to align their calendars with one another for a more streamlined process.\n\nMORE:Updated list of Premier League top goal scorers for 2025/26 season\n\nThe 2026 January transfer window closes for Premier League clubs onp.m. GMT (2 p.m. ET).\n\nThis is because the traditional closing date, January 31, falls on a Saturday, and as such it will close on the following Monday.\n\nLike the open date, the closing date is also matched for all of the major European leagues, meaning England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France's top flights all have the same closing date.\n\nThe only slight quirk is the time of day the window closes on. Serie A, Ligue 1, and the Bundesliga have synced with the Premier League perfectly, also closing at 7 p.m. GMT / 8 p.m. CET. However, the transfer window in Spain closes at 11:59 p.m. CET.\n\nThe January transfer window is a month-long period during which clubs can make changes to their roster.\n\nTechnically, a \"transfer window\" is actually a registration period, during which teams can register new players and make general changes to their league-official squad.\n\nPlayers acquired outside a transfer window cannot be registered until the new window opens.\n\nAdditionally, starting January 1, players who are out of contract in the summer are allowed to sign a pre-contract agreement with a new club, under certain circumstances (e.g. Premier League players can sign for a foreign team). They are still contracted to their current club through the end of the season, but they are able to sign agreements with a new team to take effect at the expiration of their current deal.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the intricacies of the handball rule in soccer",

    "fullText": "The transfer window closes tonight at 7pm after over a month of business across the Premier League.\n\nHowever, fans hoping to see late activity in the market at their clubs can keep the faith beyond 7pm.\n\nClubs are still allowed to strike deals after that time, provided they meet a specific rule that grants them a two-hour extension to finalise signings.\n\nA deal sheet is effectively a way for clubs to tell the Premier League that a transfer has been agreed – but they just need a bit more time to finalise the official documents.\n\nPremier League clubs can only use a deal sheet after 5pm, and it must be submitted before 7pm.\n\nIf all the relevant details are filled in, the Premier League grant an extra two hours for the deal to be completed.\n\nYou can see an example of a deal sheet below.\n\nArsenal signed Raheem Sterling using a deal sheet in summer 2024 – and once all media duties had been carried out, the Gunners ended up announcing the signing around 2am.\n\nHowever, this is only applicable to domestic transfers, and clubs must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight if they want to complete an international signing from abroad.\n\nThe Premier League describe the FIFA Transfer Matching System as follows.\n\n“When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on FIFA’s Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated.\n\n“The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details.\n\n“Our FA will request clearance and, as long as everything matches, the foreign association will issue clearance to the FA, who then informs the club and League.”\n\nIn years gone by, those in the English Football League (EFL) – meaning Championship, League One and League Two clubs – have also been allowed to submit a deal sheet for late transfers.\n\nHowever, the EFL have now put a stop to it.\n\nAn official statement reads: “In the EFL, all documentation must be provided prior to the deadline closing for the registration of a player to go through.”\n\nThere is – however – the presence of a ‘quick application’ which gives EFL clubs an extra 15 minutes to finalise transfers.\n\nIt is said: “If a club is in a Full Application at 10:30pm, they will receive a warning that states the system will open a Quick Application at 10:45pm, where only certain fields need to be completed.\n\n“In those last 15 minutes of the Transfer Window, EFL systems allow clubs to submit the necessary registration form without completing the full application process. Where they do this, the clubs then have a further 15 minutes to complete the full application process. This avoids clubs missing the deadline in circumstances where they have agreed and signed all necessary documents with another club and the player before 11pm, but still need time to complete the full application.”",

    "fullText": "Transfer deadline day has become an event for fans and something of a media circus in recent years, but it has always been an important day for managers, even before the current system of having transfer windows was introduced in 2002.\n\nGet it right - and get the player or players you want in at the 11th hour - and you can turn your season around.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't get important deals done or lose someone without replacing them, it can take the wind out of your sails and deflate a team involved in a promotion bid or survival battle.\n\nI never saw making late signings as a risk, because I always thought the players I was bringing in would make the team better.\n\nLooking back at the transfer deadline day deals I was involved in was really interesting. Yes, I had a few stinkers, but also some really good ones. A theme emerged which showed that if you can do good business, it can really change the fortunes of the team.\n\nAt Crystal Palace on the final day of the January window in 2014, for example, the permanent additions of Scott Dann, Wayne Hennessey, Joe Ledley and also Tom Ince on loan, sparked an amazing turnaround.\n\nWe were in a relegation battle and in serious trouble near the bottom of the Premier League when they arrived but we ended up 11th, 12 points clear of the bottom three, after securing our survival with three games to go.\n\nAll four new players were great positives who played a huge part in our improvement. I am not saying they upgraded the quality of our players but they gave us a better balance as a team, which I felt we lacked before they came in.\n\nGaining that balance enabled us to stay in the Premier League.",

    "fullText": "When the video assistant referee (VAR) stats are released at the end of the season, there will be a long list of correct interventions.\n\nThere will probably be three on the list from Sunday's Premier League matches.\n\nYet sometimes correct decisions come at a cost.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there,\" MOTD pundit Danny Murphy said of the VAR decisions.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\n\n\"I get VAR is here to stay and we are trying our best to embrace it but the time it is taking sometimes is too much.\n\n\"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone - most people would say that I think.\"\n\nIt took more than two minutes to cancel Manchester United's penalty against Fulham and change it to a free-kick.\n\nAlmost three and a half minutes were lost when the VAR ruled out a Fulham goal for offside.\n\nAston Villa's disallowed goal against Brentford only came about after a four-minute stoppage.\n\nIn contrast, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was left fuming after VAR quickly agreed with the onfield decision that Dominic Solanke hadn't fouled Marc Guehi for Tottenham's opener in the 2-2 draw.\n\nLong delays, mixed messages and irate managers have been the story of the day. As has been the case on too many occasions.\n\nAfter Sunday's incidents, many will agree with Murphy.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City take on Tottenham Hotspur today at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a crucial Premier League fixture. Pep Guardiola’s side will be eager to pick up three points to move back within four points of Premier League leaders Arsenal. Mikel Arteta’s side sits seven points clear of City after their win over Leeds United yesterday. City will take on a Tottenham side that has struggled in the Premier League this season. Thomas Frank’s side has flattered to deceive in terms of their performance in the league. But they did beat City earlier this season, so a tough test awaits Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nHere is the latest City injury news and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of today’s match.\n\nThere are a host of players who are unavailable for today’s match due to injury for Manchester City. Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, John Stones, Mateo Kovacic, Jeremy Doku and Savinho are all ruled out of today’s match. Pep Lijnders revealed that Doku is set to be ruled out for between two-three weeks due to the calf injury he sustained in City’s win over Galatasaray. Lijnders also revealed that Ruben Dias is set to return to training on Monday. Today’s match comes too soon for Manchester City’s defensive leader but his return from a hamstring injury is imminent.\n\nManchester City will be boosted by the returns of Rodri, Marc Guehi, and Antoine Semenyo. Rodri missed Manchester City’s win over Galatasaray due to suspension, but he is available for today’s pivotal match. Guehi and Semenyo were both ineligible to play in the Champions League, but both return today in a huge boost for Pep Guardiola’s side.",

    "description": "After Chelsea's first comeback win from two goals down in a Premier League match, were Liam Rosenior's substitutions against West Ham genius or obvious?",
    "fullText": "It has been some start to life as a Premier League manager for Liam Rosenior.\n\nSaturday's thrilling comeback win against West Ham was Chelsea's third league win in a row since the 41-year-old replaced Enzo Maresca at the start of January.\n\nAnd, in one of his biggest tests to date, it was his drastic half-time substitutions that led to the Blues recovering from 2-0 down to win 3-2 and moved them into the top four.\n\nAfter making seven changes from their midweek Champions League win in Napoli, a limp first-half display allowed relegation-threatened West Ham to deservedly take control.\n\nBut, making three half-time changes, Rosenior inspired a comeback in which substitutes Marc Cucurella and Joao Pedro hauled Chelsea level with a goal apiece - before Enzo Fernandez's dramatic stoppage-time winner.\n\nCriticism can be levelled at Chelsea for a poor first half in which they were booed off, fully deserved to be two goals down, and raised further questions about the quality of their squad.\n\nAfter the match, Rosenior played down the importance of his substitutions, instead crediting the mentality of the players since his arrival.\n\n\"My biggest learning is there's a spirit and a fight and a resilience in this group that I really, really like,\" he said. \"I've demanded that from the first day of stepping in.\n\n\"We haven't had many training sessions, but we've spoken about reacting positively to setbacks.\n\n\"We've spoken about reactions to losing the ball, pressing, energy, intensity. All of that was there in the second half, which wasn't there in the first half. I don't put that just down to the changes I made.\"\n\nOverall, Rosenior's early reign, now four weeks old, has been characterised by grinding out results and impactful in‑game adjustments.\n\nHis predecessor Maresca ended his tenure after a breakdown in relations with the ownership and having dropped a league‑high 15 points from winning positions - prompting frequent criticism of his mid-match decisions.\n\nFormer Chelsea winger Pat Nevin told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Liam Rosenior went back to not exactly Chelsea's best team, but what Chelsea knew and the system they feel comfortable in. It now feels like tactical genius because they have won.\"",

    "fullText": "The trendy thing to do heading into today’s match was to doubt Arsenal, to find reasons why they’d continue to stumble, and to play up Leeds’ chances of getting a result against the Premier League leaders at Elland Road. The problem is when you peddle cheap narratives like that, you often wind up looking foolish. Arsenal made a lot of people look quite foolish today. The Gunners steamrolled Leeds 4-0 to help cure their slight malaise, lay down a bit of a marker, and restore their 7-point lead atop the table ahead of tomorrow’s matches.\n\nMikel Arteta seems to have hit all the right notes in his team meeting earlier this week and his players responded with an excellent away performance, the biggest away win of the season so far. Arteta went with a more physical lineup to start, which matched up well with Leeds’ high pressure, rough play. The home crowd were up for the match and their noise and fervor seemed to be influencing referee decisions. For the opening 25 minutes, it felt like it might be one of those matches — Arsenal control the game, get kicked all over the pitch without protection, get whistled for a bunch of fouls that aren’t being called the other way, and something weird / annoying decides a close game for the other team.\n\nIn a half of football without much of anything from open play, Arsenal unsurprisingly opened the scoring from a set piece. Well technically from the second phase of a set piece but still. The Gunners recycled the ball to Noni Madueke, who started because Bukayo Saka felt something in warmups, to fire in an excellent cross. Martin Zubimendi ran across the near post and deftly guided a header into the back of the net.\n\nArsenal doubled their lead eleven minutes later when Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlowe punched a Madueke corner into his own net. Set piece again ole ole, own goal again ole ole. That it goes down as an own goal is a bit unfair to Noni Madueke. His corner was curling into the goal and would have gone in on it’s own. Madueke had an excellent game, especially considering he wasn’t expecting to start. It’s unfair to Darlow too, who was well put off his punch by teammate Dominic Calvert-Lewin jumping with and into him at the near post. It’s not unfair to DCL, who minutes earlier got away without a yellow card for a nasty studs to ankle and foot challenge on Gabriel that, in my opinion, merited review for a possible red card.\n\nThe Arsenal second goal drew that prolific scorer Owen Goal level with Viktor Gyokeres for the team lead in PL goals with five. But the Swede reclaimed his spot atop the stats sheet midway through the second half (but not before he was too slow to shoot and was charged down from behind after being in on goal). In the 68th minute, substitute Gabriel Martinelli ran down a long ball in the corner. He worked himself free for a cross and hit an absolute peach of a ball. Gyokeres fought through a foul and touched it home. It was exactly the type of goal Arsenal brought Big Vik in to score and it put the game to bed.\n\nUntil Gyokeres’ goal, Leeds had been dominating the ball. It’s tough to say the home side were “on top” for that period because the possession was entirely sterile. Arsenal were happy to let them knock it around the middle third and perimeter. Anytime Leeds tried to penetrate and get the ball into a dangerous area, they were calmly rebuffed. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been feasting on action in the box from the penalty spot and in this season. But if the ball doesn’t get into that space, he can’t do much of anything. The Arsenal CBs consistently outmatched him — in the air, on physical strength, and on quickness to balls into him on the ground.\n\nThe opening 15-20 minutes of the second half weren’t pretty to watch, although I’d bet Mikel Arteta loved it. Leeds had three shots in the entire match and the only one on target was a tame header from a corner. The Gunners were extremely effective, completely blunting the home side’s attacking, burning 20 minutes off the clock at 2-0 up, and converting their second big chance to put the game away by stretching it to 3-0.\n\nFrom 60 minutes on, Arsenal had 10 shots, good for 1.8 xG and 2 goals. That’s how you kill off a game. Gabriel Jesus, who nearly scored immediately after coming on for Gyokeres, got the Arsenal fourth in the 86th minute. Martin Ødegaard found the Brazilian with an excellent progressive pass threaded between defenders. Gabby J’s control and turn was excellent, but it looked as if the opportunity had gone when he didn’t immediately pull the trigger. So often Gabriel Jesus takes that extra touch or two and ends up having his shot blocked. This time, he worked a second shooting window and calmly put the ball into the corner.\n\nToday’s match was a case-in-point example of why teams don’t play high pressure, more open football against Arsenal in the Premier League. The Gunners will match you for intensity, strength, and speed, grind you down, and smash you to bits once your legs have gone. As the clock ticked down, the announcers lamented that Leeds didn’t give it more of a go against Arsenal. But they did! They tried to play their way. They pressed high, played physical football, and got battered for doing it.\n\nLeeds United have a -11 goal difference this season, -9 of that has come against Arsenal. Before today, they’d only lost once since the start of December. They’ve been particularly good at Elland Road. The Gunners went in there and made them look like a Championship side.\n\nIt feels a bit odd to say because the Premier League leaders should be winning away to the 16th-place side, but this was an excellent performance by Arsenal and a quality win. Everyone spent the week questioning Arsenal’s credentials and mettle. People wondered whether the second-leading scorers in the Premier League could score enough goals to win the title. The team responded in a big way — two goals from set pieces, two goals from strikers in open play, and smothering defense.\n\nOver to you, Manchester City and Aston Villa. Will “struggling” Arsenal pick up points on their pursuers or will we end the weekend as we started it, just with one fewer game in which they might reel in the leaders?",

    "fullText": "Another crucial Premier League matchweek awaits, with title contenders, European hopefuls, and relegation battlers all facing defining tests.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City both face tricky away fixtures as the pressure at the top of the table intensifies. Several sides in the bottom half will view this round as a major opportunity to gain breathing room.\n\nWith injuries, suspensions, and recent form playing a key role, fine margins are expected to decide many of the fixtures. This gameweek promises drama across the table and potential shifts at both ends of the standings.\n\nBrighton extended their winless run to three matches following a 2–1 defeat to Fulham last week. The Seagulls have struggled in front of goal, scoring just once in each of their last three games.\n\nThis clash with Everton is expected to be a tight affair decided by fine margins. Brajan Gruda has been passed fit, while Diego Gómez remains a doubt.\n\nA second-half goal from Thierno Barry earned Everton a point against Leeds, extending their unbeaten run to three matches and lifting them into the top half of the table.\n\nJack Grealish has been ruled out for the season with an ankle injury, while Tim Iroegbunam is a doubt. Michael Keane remains suspended for the final match of his three-game ban.\n\nLeeds welcome league leaders Arsenal to Elland Road hoping to disrupt the Gunners’ title charge.\n\nThe Whites have enjoyed a strong run of form, losing just one of their last six matches, which has lifted them to 16th in the table with 26 points.\n\nGabriel Gudmundsson has an outside chance of featuring, while Jaka Bijol, Lukas Nmecha, and Daniel James remain close to a return but will miss this fixture.\n\nArsenal suffered only their third league defeat of the season against Manchester United last week.\n\nThe result cut their lead at the top to four points, leaving Mikel Arteta’s side with little margin for error. The Gunners boast an almost fully fit squad, with Max Dowman the only confirmed absentee.\n\nBottom-placed Wolves saw their four-game unbeaten run end with a 2–0 defeat to title contenders Manchester City. Despite an improved performance, Pep Guardiola’s side ultimately proved too strong.\n\nJean-Ricner Bellegarde has returned from injury, while Ladislav Krejčí is a doubt due to illness.\n\nBournemouth picked up a morale-boosting 3–2 win against reigning champions Liverpool to extend their unbeaten run to three matches.\n\nA dramatic 95th-minute winner from Amine Adli sent the Cherries’ fans into raptures and eased concerns following the departure of Antoine Semenyo. David Brooks remains a doubt.\n\nChelsea made it back-to-back wins with a convincing victory over an out-of-sorts Crystal Palace last week, with goals from Estêvão, João Pedro, and Enzo Fernández.\n\nThe Blues followed that up with a Champions League win over Napoli to secure automatic qualification for the next round. Confidence is clearly building under the Stamford Bridge lights.\n\nLiverpool bounced back from late heartbreak against Bournemouth by securing a resounding 6–0 win over Qarabag in the Champions League.\n\nThe victory guaranteed progression to the knockout stages and restored confidence. Ibrahima Konaté and Curtis Jones have been passed fit, while Jeremie Frimpong remains sidelined.\n\nNewcastle’s four-game unbeaten league run came to an end with a 2–0 home defeat to Aston Villa. Despite that setback, the Magpies remain in the top half of the table.\n\nJoelinton and Tino Livramento are ruled out, while Bruno Guimarães is a doubt.\n\nAston Villa returned to winning ways with a vital victory over Newcastle, moving them closer to league leaders Arsenal.\n\nIt was their first league win in three matches, and they followed it up with an impressive Europa League comeback against Red Bull Salzburg.\n\nYouri Tielemans and John McGinn remain long-term absentees, while Ross Barkley and Ollie Watkins are doubts.\n\nBrentford received a boost as Mikkel Damsgaard and Kristoffer Ajer avoided serious injuries and could feature after being substituted in last week’s defeat to Nottingham Forest.\n\nMichael Carrick will look to extend his dream start as Manchester United’s interim manager by securing a third consecutive win.\n\nVictories over Manchester City and Arsenal have lifted the mood around Old Trafford to levels not seen in years. Patrick Dorgu has been ruled out for ten weeks with a thigh injury, while Joshua Zirkzee remains a doubt.\n\nFulham’s 2-1 win over Brighton last week saw them move just three points behind Chelsea in fifth place.\n\nThe Cottagers have only lost once in their last five games, with two of them being wins. Kenny Tete has been passed fit for the Cottagers, while Samuel Chukwueze is a doubt due to personal reasons.\n\nNottingham Forest made it three games unbeaten with a much-needed win over Brentford.\n\nWhile their season has been inconsistent, recent results suggest improved defensive discipline as they aim to pull clear of the relegation zone.\n\nCrystal Palace continues to struggle, with off-field and on-field issues mounting.\n\nJustin Devenny is ruled out for three weeks with an ankle ligament injury, Philippe Mateta will not travel due to personal reasons, and Adam Wharton is suspended.\n\nSpurs host Manchester City in the standout fixture of the gameweek. Thomas Frank’s side have struggled domestically, failing to win any of their last five league matches and sitting 14th in the table.\n\nHowever, a Champions League victory over Eintracht Frankfurt secured automatic qualification to the next round. Micky van de Ven will undergo a late fitness test.\n\nManchester City returned to winning ways with a routine 2–0 victory over Wolves, their first league win in five matches. Pep Guardiola’s side face a tougher test this weekend, with Jeremy Doku and Rúben Dias both ruled out.\n\nSunderland slipped out of the top half of the table following a 3–1 defeat to West Ham.\n\nThe Black Cats have won just once in their last five matches but remain level on points with several top-ten sides. A clash with fellow newly promoted Burnley promises an open contest. Captain Granit Xhaka is ruled out through injury.\n\nBurnley picked up their third consecutive draw against Spurs last week, leaving them rooted in 19th place. The Clarets remain ten points from safety after 23 games, but Joe Worrall and Zion Flemming have both been passed fit for this fixture.",

    "description": "“At the end of the day, the fans care about staying in the Premier League and this has to have been the best season most can remember. So it’s thanks to those who got us here, but it’s time for the baton to be passed on,” writes Nic Wiseman.",
    "fullText": "With the current transfer window seemingly being used to ship players surplus to requirements, the news that Aji Alese has joined Portsmouth on loan prompted me to take a look at a typical team from last season and see how they have fared this year.\n\nTo do this, I dipped into my box of programmes and fished one out at random. And the game in question is Derby away on 21 January, which was a midweek game on a dank Tuesday night.\n\nWe had just had the chastening experience at Burnley the preceding Friday night, where Wilson Isidor failed to score two penalties in injury time.\n\nWe won the game at Derby 1-0 thanks to an Eliezer Mayenda goal in the 28th minute and Wilson inexplicably had a goal struck off, for reasons nobody was able to fathom. Even the scoreboard took ages to revert from 0-2 back to 0-1.\n\nThe team that night was: Patterson, Cirkin, O’Nien, Mepham, Hume, Le Fée, Jobe, Neil, Rigg, Isidor, Mayenda.\n\nRoberts replaced Mayenda and Ballard, Cirkin on 74 minutes; Abdul Samed replaced Rigg on 86 minutes and Leo Hjelde came on for Le Fée on 89.\n\nIt was only the second time Régis Le Bris had listened to my pleas for 4-4-2 all season. As it had worked so well against Sheffield United on New Year’s Day, I was desperate to see it again. The only memorable thing about the game was how stultifyingly boring it was. Pride Park is situated in the middle of a soulless industrial estate and there was no pub near that I could find.\n\nThe combined number of appearances that team (including used substitutes) have made this season is 119. Which ticks up to 132 if you include all players who played last season.\n\nThe departures of Dan Neil and Aji Alese this week have triggered much hand-wringing about the fact that these hard workers have been ruthlessly jettisoned this season in order to ensure we maintain our position in the Premier League. But the cold, hard facts are that these players haven’t been good enough to play in the Premier League. In fact you could say that the club has done well by the players in allowing them to go off on loan to showcase their talents. Especially in the case of Dan Neil, who has been allowed to go off to Ipswich on loan, until his contract winds down.\n\nThe trio who have stepped up from last season’s side are Enzo Le Fée, Dan Ballard and Trai Hume. All could be considered first-team regulars this season and make up just under half the total appearances from last year’s team. Le Fée was bought from Roma in Italy’s Serie A in the January transfer window and was brought in on loan as a statement with half an eye on us being in the Premier League this season. He is a bit of an outlier in this analysis.\n\nJenson Seelt can consider himself to be unlucky, as he made an assured debut against West Ham on the first day of the season, only to be injured in the second half and replaced by Omar Alderete. He was subsequently shipped out on loan to German side Wolfsburg.\n\nOf the team involved that night, two returned to their parent clubs from loan: Mepham and Abdul Samed; Roberts and Neil have been loaned out, seven have started matches this season and two (including Neil) have come on from the subs bench.\n\nTo be honest, more have been involved this season than I expected, with seven making more than ten appearances this season.\n\nThe club do seem to be doing well by those players as they look to find pastures new. Which will enhance the club’s reputation as looking after players’ interests.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the fans care about staying in the Premier League and this has to have been the best season most can remember. So it’s thanks to those who got us here, but it’s time for the baton to be passed on.\n\nThose who played last season, but not at Derby",

And what impact might that have?\n\nOne of the things about Arteta's Arsenal side which has been criticised is the Gunners do not have a clear goalscorer in the Premier League.\n\nThey signed Viktor Gyokeres in a summer deal worth £64m, but things have not clicked for the striker and he has just five league goals this season.\n\nBut the Gunners still have a hugely impressive record with the forward in the team, despite his issues in front of goal, and it is not only the Swedish international who has struggled to find the net.\n\nNone of the Arsenal frontline are particularly in top form.\n\nGyokeres – 0 non-penalty goals in past 11 Premier League appearances\n\nBukayo Saka – 0 goals in past 13 appearances in all competitions\n\nGabriel Martinelli – 0 goals in past 13 Premier League appearances\n\nNoni Madueke – 0 goals in past 25 Premier League appearances\n\nLeandro Trossard – one goal in past 11 appearances in all competitions\n\n\"Saka is the one that has really surprised us,\" said former England captain Steph Houghton on the Monday Night Club. \"For all the games he plays you think he has goals and assists, but to have none in his last 13 games is a surprise.\n\n\"He is one of their key players who is meant to be creating and scoring.\n\n\"We always thought Gyokeres was going to be the missing piece to the puzzle for Arsenal this season as the number nine.\n\n\"Sometimes, Arsenal become a little bit too predictable. Now teams have started to work them out. I feel as though they could be off the cuff more.\"\n\nArsenal have been Premier League leaders at this stage of a season three times previously, but only went on to lift the title once, in 2003.\n\nBBC Sport fan writer Laura Kirk-Francis said the feeling of nervousness was down to high stakes and supporters feeling like they have something to lose.\n\n\"It's a combination of a few things, but certainly there is some residual trauma about the two seasons where we felt on track for the title and suddenly fell away,\" she added.\n\n\"Because of that, I think we are all on edge searching for any signs that the same thing might happen again, hence the big meltdown after the Manchester United game.\"\n\nWith their last league title in 2004 and finishing behind Manchester City twice and then Liverpool last season, recent history does not bode well for Arsenal when it comes down to a tense finale.\n\nThey are currently clear of both City and Aston Villa after 23 games, with Liverpool 14 points behind in sixth spot.\n\n\"The nerves also come from a sense that this team feels deserving of silverware,\" said Kirk-Francis. \"Given the quality of the players, how consistent they've been, some of the performances at the beginning of the season - it's sparked a bit of desperation I think which leads to nervousness.\n\n\"I'd also say there are some parts of the fanbase who see this season as a now or never, particularly with Liverpool's fall-off and how shaky Man City have looked at times.\n\n\"The nervousness comes from a sense of having something within reach but knowing it could all fall apart at any one moment...and the only person to blame would be ourselves!\"\n\nArsenal are one of the biggest clubs in the world with a global fanbase, so the nerves among supporters are being felt both inside Emirates Stadium and in the wider arena, particularly on social media.\n\nAFTV on YouTube is one of the outlets synonymous with fan views and founder Robbie Lyle agrees with Arteta that fans and players need to embrace the challenge of a title race.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot more of these games between now and the end of the season,\" Lyle told BBC Sport at a Kick It Out event which is aiming to make the pub a more inclusive space for fans.\n\n\"Every team thinks, 'how can we stop Arsenal?' Keep it tight and get the anxiety flowing. This is what it is going to be from now until the end of the season.\n\n\"I still think Arsenal are good enough to win this league, I still think they are going to win this league. Just treat that as a lesson. In life you have lessons. That was a lesson on Sunday, go now and go and beat Leeds and let's get back on track.\"\n\nLike many Arsenal fans, the pain of missing out for three successive years, and not winning any trophy since the 2020 FA Cup, is a factor in why things feel so desperate.\n\n\"Three years in a row we have come second.\" added Lyle. \"Even though I'm trying my hardest to be calm, I'm thinking, 'oh no, we're not going to do this again are we?' I think it is just a natural thing.\n\n\"I have been to every game this season. We are the best team in this league - just go and win the thing now.\n\n\"We're trying to help them but we're nervous as well.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "As we dig into Premier League predictions for Week 24, one fixture jumps off the fixture list as one that could shake up the expectations for the top four picture, and that's Newcastle's visit to Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nYou could forgive Eddie Howe if he flat out hated Liverpool — yes, even after the Magpies ended their long trophy drought by claiming the League Cup with a win at Wembley Stadium last winter.\n\nThat's because Howe has otherwise been beaten by the Reds way more often than not during his dozen-or-so years managing against them with Bournemouth and Newcastle.\n\nMORE — Champions League playoff draw complete\n\nAnd at Anfield, you can basically forget about it.\n\nHowe's record is 2W-2D-19L all-time against Liverpool, with the wins coming at Wembley and St. James' Park. Anfield has been especially cruel to Howe, who was 1D-5L there as Bournemouth boss and is yet to claim a point from four trips there with Newcastle.\n\nIs that why he limited minutes for his preferred attacking trop of Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, and Yoane Wissa in the Champions League at midweek while giving Bruno Guimaraes, Kieran Trippier, and Jacob Murphy — two of whom are just returning to fitness — zero minutes at the Parc des Princes?\n\nMaybe, but Arne Slot's men produced a 5-0 lead after about an hour at midweek and won't have felt too stressed by their workload versus Qarabag, who are coincidentally the Magpies next opponent in the Champions League.\n\nCan Howe's Magpies shake off their history and scoop up a rare result on Merseyside?\n\n10am ET Saturday — NBCSN — Watch live on Peacock\n\nEverton won the reverse fixture but Brighton have been much better home than away this season. The Seagulls are 5W-5D-1L at the Amex and 2W-4D-6L as visitors. But Everton are now healthy in the midfield and can win a battle with several different combinations. Branthwaite’s return opens up a lot for the Toffees, and they may figure things out on Saturday. Brighton 1-2 Everton.\n\n10am ET Saturday — USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nThe Gunners attack is healthy and if their explosion is coming soon. That’s not to say they’ll snap out of it straightaway, but their slow run of form combined with Leeds’ stunning record against the big boys gives this the aire of regression to the norm. Team “2-nil to the title” returning this weekend?. Leeds 0-2 Arsenal.\n\n10am ET Saturday— Watch live on Peacock\n\nBournemouth have just one win away from the Vitality Stadium this season and they are bedding in a number of new components while missing key figures like Tavernier, Kluivert, and Adams. They have the tactical acumen to find a win here, but Wolves should show up with vigor and this could be a day of hope for Edwards’ boys. Wolves 1-0 Bournemouth.\n\n12:30pm ET Saturday— USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nThe Blues have been producing chances moving forward but also give up a fair amount of opportunities going back the other way. West Ham conceded a whopping 12 goals off corner kicks while Chelsea have been productive with their corners. A lot of this adds up in favor of the hosts, even if they had to deal with a Champions League match at midweek. Chelsea 2-1 West Ham.\n\n3pm ET Saturday — NBC — Watch online via NBC.com\n\nNewcastle impressed in the Champions League with a draw away to Paris Saint-Germain, especially since the Starting XI made it appear that Eddie Howe had one eye on this fixture. Liverpool hammered Qarabag at midweek and edged the Magpies in the reverse fixture, which saw 10-man Newcastle come back from 2-nil down just to lose late. Both sides are stretched so goals are on the menu. Liverpool 1-1 Newcastle.\n\n9am ET Sunday — USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nBrentford have not been great away from the Gtech Community Stadium, and any advantage given by Villa’s Thursday match in the Europa League has been minimized by Emery’s heavy squad rotation. Aston Villa 2-1 Brentford.\n\n9am ET Sunday— NBCSN — Watch live on Peacock\n\nMan Utd's turnaround under Michael Carrick has been quite a treat for Red Devils fans, and there will be plenty guessing that it will continue at Old Trafford against the Cottagers. The sides drew 1-1 at Craven Cottage and deservedly so, but the Red Devils may get enough extra juice from the home crowd to deliver another three points to their new boss. Manchester United 2-1 Fulham.\n\n9am ET Sunday — Watch live on Peacock\n\nPalace heads must be spinning with Oliver Glasner set to leave in the summer and Mateta possibly joining Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze as stars to depart Selhurst Park since the summer. Adam Wharton missing this game through suspension just adds to the misery. Forest won’t be as fresh but it’s not difficult to project at least something from the group. Nottingham Forest 1-1 Crystal Palace.\n\n11:30am ET Sunday — NBCSN — Watch live on Peacock\n\nSpurs’ injury list is long and they haven’t been great at home to boot. Anything’s possible as Frank knows how to play the underdog role, but the likely result lies on the side of Pep Guardiola’s visitors. Tottenham Hotspur 0-2 Manchester City.\n\n3pm ET Monday— USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nSunderland have regressed to the norm with regular xG losses over the past month. The question is whether their norm is higher than that of Monday's visitors. One might argue that the Clarets have been as unlucky as Sunderland's been fortunate, but the Stadium of Light feels like a tiebreaker here. Maybe that's the wrong word... Sunderland 0-0 Burnley.",

    "fullText": "The Scout's verdict is in ahead of Gameweek 24 in Fantasy Premier League as City visit Spurs.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side visit the capital on Sunday 1 February, with kick-off scheduled for 16:30 (UK).\n\nThe Blues lock horns with Thomas Frank’s side with the view of recording a third win in succession in all competitions.\n\nBut we face a Spurs side who beat Frankfurt 2-0 in the Champions League in their previous assignment, meaning we’ll need to be at our best to collect three points this weekend.\n\nAll roads lead to an enthralling clash in north London and FPL managers will have an eye on proceedings at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nRead the latest Scout report below ahead of Saturday 31 January’s 13:30 (UK) deadline.\n\nRayan Cherki (£6.7m) looks a great option for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) managers ahead of Gameweek 24 (GW24).\n\nThe Frenchman has created 33 chances this season, of which 14 have been big chances, meaning 42.54% of his chances have been big ones. This is team leading at City.\n\nHe has also created a chance, on average, every 30 minutes in the league this season, which is the most of all the regular starters at the Blues.\n\nCherki’s 45 crosses, can only be bettered by Phil Foden (£8.5m) across the City team and his 64 successful passes into the penalty box is ten more than the next most in Guardiola’s squad.\n\nChristian Romero (£5.0m) is Spurs’ form player. The defender has scored six goals this season including three goals in the last three matches in all competitions.\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Gibbs-White (£7.3m) and Matty Cash (£4.8m) are low-owned gems who can return points in Gameweek 24.\n\nGibbs-White has returned two goals, one assist, three bonus points and two clean sheet points in the last four matches.\n\nCash has registered an assist and two clean sheets in the last four gameweeks. This season he has created 19 chances, only eight defenders can better that.\n\nThere’s no membership needed to get up to four tickets per person for our FA Cup fourth round clash with neighbours Salford City*.\n\nPriced from £17.50 for adults and £7.50 for children, it’s a fun day out for all the family on Saturday 14 February.\n\nHospitality for this game starts from just £60 with a wide range of options to suit every budget!\n\n*Tickets are on sale to all fans who have purchased at least one home fixture. You must have had an active supporter number before Sunday 11 January and the previous purchase number excludes previous fixtures v Salford.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has admitted his side are struggling to find any consistency in the league this season.\n\nThe Reds are sixth in the table and have lost seven of their 23 league games.\n\nSpeaking after their 6-0 Champions League win over Qarabag, van Dijk said: “I think I said it, in the Premier League, the problem and difficulties that we’re having at the moment is that we don’t have the consistency.\n\n“We can’t, so far, build enough good performances this season. And that’s something we’re working at, it’s something we have to improve.\n\n“We know we can do it, but like I said, not on a consistent basis. That’s why we have been struggling.”\n\nLiverpool’s win over Qarabag featured substitute appearances from teenage trio Rio Ngumoha, Amara Nallo, and Trey Nyoni.\n\nAnd the Dutchman has also warned that the level of scrutiny faced by players could become even harsher for the “next generation” of footballers.\n\nHe said: “I know what comes if you don’t perform. If I don’t have a good moment or a good game, that’s just part and parcel of football. But I’m a human being, and all the players before me have been through it too.\n\n“I’ve mentioned this in previous interviews, I think it’s going to be even tougher for the next generation of footballers. I wish them luck, and I’ll try to prepare them a little by talking to them about it.\n\n“But going forward, it will be very difficult, because everything is so micro nowadays. Back in the day, you played, things happened, good or bad, and that was part of it. For the next generation, it will be very tricky, and I want to help in the best way I can by sharing my experiences.”\n\nLiverpool take on Newcastle on Saturday and will look to get back to winning ways after five league games without a win.",

    "title": "Arsenal, Mikel Arteta and the ‘fear of failure’ they are trying to banish",
    "description": "Arsenal players were encouraged to speak up about how they were feeling as Arteta looks to prevent a recent blip in their Premier League title race from snowballing",
    "fullText": "On the morning after Arsenal’s 3-2 defeat to Manchester United, Mikel Arteta realised his players needed one specific message. The Basque and team discussed the principle that “you can't lose something you haven’t won, so leave all that behind”.\n\nPlayers were also encouraged to speak up about how they were feeling. There had been a release.\n\nArteta and his staff are aware of a “fear of failure” discussion encircling his team, so he knew he had to make them look at it in a different way.\n\n“Let’s enjoy it,” Arteta said, as he spoke of how it can’t be like this week to week for four months. The message was a progression of his dressing-room speech immediately after United.\n\n“This is the journey you’re on if you’re going to win the title,” Arteta said. “It’s not always going to go your way.”\n\nIn other words, there will be setbacks, especially if a team is seeking to be champions for the first time. It’s rarely been smooth, despite the perception Manchester City have given.\n\nArteta is said to have pitched the speech at exactly the right tone, something that is more notable since there has been a tendency for such performances to send him further in the other direction; more intense.\n\nStepping back a bit, the Arsenal manager instead came to a realisation. He could see there was something deeper than a normal setback.\n\nThe speech did bring a shift in training, aided by a forgiving win over Kairat.\n\nWhether the message fully sinks in, however, is the next question.\n\nArsenal might go out at Leeds United pumped to make amends for Sunday only for Karl Darlow to make a big save early on or Pascal Struijk to clatter a forward. Then, all the same thoughts from Sunday might surge back.\n\nSaturday does have the feel of a hinge fixture, primarily because Arsenal have such a tough match at the same time that many insiders wonder whether “the biggest game is in their own heads”. They’d still be top if they lost, after all, but no one would even consider that. The talk would be loss of momentum, and belief.\n\nHence Arteta knowing he has to get his team playing with conviction again. Or even, the conviction they offer in every competition that isn’t the Premier League. That alone reflects the psychology around all this.\n\nIt’s also easier said than done, given the “pressure bubble” Arteta’s staff feel the team are in, one obviously expanded by fans and so much social media noise. That’s what long waits without a title do, especially as you get so close.\n\nHence Arteta’s will to try and stamp out that “fear of failure”.\n\nOne of his biggest challenges might be finding a solution, which is why Monday might have been be so important.\n\nOthers still feel it’s Arteta himself that could do with a chat, because of how emotionally he lives all this. Perhaps it’s where Josh Kroenke could offer counsel, from his experience of success with the ownership’s American franchises.\n\nOne complication with any solution, after all, is that it is Arteta’s own intensity that has fed this atmosphere. And while it should never be overlooked that the Basque’s energy was absolutely crucial in restoring Arsenal as a force - and this probably would not have happened without it - the wonder is now whether such an important strength may have to just be tempered to actually get over the line. Not a total reassessment, but a tweak.\n\nArteta’s coaching base, after all, is “trying to control every element of play”. This approach has taken Arsenal to the top, as they tend to win virtually every game on xG. Described as “a probabilities man”, Arteta believes that if you do that in 35 of 38 matches, you likely win the league.\n\nThat final gap to actual victory nevertheless fosters a sense of “trying to win a title by process” and whether he’s overlooking that final human edge required.\n\nA question has been asked over whether the team is now so overcoached it is no longer so geared for attackers to score.\n\nThat can be seen in recent player stats on individual goals and assists, but also in other tangible effects with players, and within games.\n\nIn the 0-0 against Nottingham Forest, for example, Arsenal mostly executed their gameplan and another day would likely have seen them convert an xG of 2.37 to win. Again, probabilities.\n\nBut that in itself arguably illustrated the difference between process and true end product necessary to win the title. People may be fed up with references to Sir Alex Ferguson’s United, but it was hard not to think of one recently resurfaced quote about chasing wins.\n\n“The risk is you shove people in the box, because other teams react... but the value in the risk, if you score in the last minute of injury time - the dressing room after was electric.”\n\nIn order to bring that risk, Arteta pushed for Eberechi Eze’s signing. Except, it was then noted the playmaker was suddenly out of the team much more after failing to track Matty Cash in the 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa.\n\nInsiders similarly talk of how decisions on shape and structure have recently taken precedence over creativity.\n\nAs a Pep Guardiola follower, too, there’s an argument Arteta suffers from the same issue the City coach did in the Champions League; that he becomes so fixated on a gameplan, meaning that there is then a vacuum if it falters.\n\nUnited showed this. At 0-0, Arteta’s plan was to stop transitions by stopping Bruno Fernandes getting on the ball. Arsenal duly had control, and it eventually produced - or perhaps processed - that first goal.\n\nIn the six minutes before Bryan Mbuemo’s strike, though, Arteta was getting increasingly frantic about player decisions and duels. Control gave way to a meeker conservatism, that manifested in the errors for the equaliser. After that, they just couldn’t get into the fight in the same way.\n\nSources say that dynamic has led to certain players becoming too conscious of defensive mistakes, an issue compounded by the feeling there is a “Premier League team” and “a cup team” and it takes a lot to change that. How close, for example, is Martin Odegaard to being dropped?\n\nIf Arteta does want to shake things up, that may happen this weekend. The Norwegian has been visibly struggling in duels, but Leeds are all about duels, which is where Mikel Merino may come in.\n\nKai Havertz is also viewed as transformative, just for how his pressing gets Arsenal playing much higher.\n\nThere is admittedly a fair question over whether the very “monotony” of so many midweek matches is having an effect, especially with that pressing. It’s also been a pattern of Arsenal’s recent seasons that there has been a December-January slump, and it was notable that 2023-24 brought the run to 89 points after a mid-season break. That just poses another reason for a mental reset.\n\nOn that, Arteta is a big tennis fan, and has previously spoken about a 2024 Roger Federer speech at Dartmouth.\n\nIn that, the tennis great spoke about how he actually lost 46 percent of all shots in his career. He just had to remind himself it was only ever one shot.\n\n“When you’re playing a point, it has to be the most important thing in the world, and it is. But when it’s behind you, it’s behind you. This mindset is really crucial because it frees you to fully commit to the next point, and the next point after that, with intensity, clarity and focus…\n\n“You want to become a master at overcoming hard moments.”\n\nArteta has perhaps realised that.\n\nArsenal are probably the best team in the country, and can win a lot this season. They just have to start playing like that again, rather than as a team that can lose a lot.",

    "fullText": "If you have listened to any of Arne Slot's news conferences this season, you will have heard the Liverpool manager refer to 'low blocks'.\n\nThe term essentially refers to a team's defensive shape - blocking space close to their own goal. The closer to their goal, the lower the block.\n\nSlot's side - who cruised to the Premier League title last season in his first year in charge - have struggled for fluidity and consistency this term.\n\nAnd one of the reasons for that, according to the Reds boss, has been their inability to break down sides who defend deep against them.\n\nBut Slot's mentions of low blocks have become so frequent that frustration has started to grow among fans.\n\nLiverpool legend Steven Gerrard said: \"He needs to stop mentioning low blocks. Low blocks have been happening against Liverpool since I was playing. That's just the way it is.\"\n\nHowever, Slot may have a point - with the Reds having faced the highest percentage of low blocks of any top-flight team this season - making up 26% of defensive tactics used against them.\n\nIn fact, the space Slot's side thrived in last year only seems to present itself against European sides in the Champions League, with Liverpool having scored nine goals - and conceded none - in their past two games in Europe.\n\nSo why are the Reds struggling against low blocks domestically, how are they trying to unlock them and what could they do better?",

Does it denigrate the new format? And why are Premier League clubs proving so powerful?\n\nSpain, which like England gained one of the two European Performance Spots for this season, has not fared well so far.\n\nOnly Barcelona are sure of the being in the last 16, with Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in the playoff round. Athletic Club and Villarreal have been eliminated.\n\nWhereas Spanish clubs used to dominate in Europe - Real Madrid won the competition twice in the past four seasons - this time they lost all but one of 10 meetings against Premier League teams in the group stage. La Liga clubs failed to score in seven matches and were beaten by an aggregate score of 21-5.\n\nBBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague describes it as \"a near-perfect storm\" which has been driven by \"collective wealth, elite decision-making off the pitch, plus a league environment that forces constant tactical evolution\".\n\nBalague added: \"The Premier League has the biggest budgets, but also professional structures - recruitment departments, data analysis, coaching teams and sporting directors - all working at a level that allows clubs to choose better profiles of players and managers.\n\n\"There is an advantage even before a ball is kicked.\"\n\nBalague believes only Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich can match English clubs in all the four areas of \"organised attack, structured defence, attacking transition and defensive transition\".\n\nEnglish clubs are now fully attuned to the European style, Balague says.\n\n\"Rather than imposing something radically different, they are adapting to what Europe now requires,\" he explained.\n\n\"Defensive composure, winning the duels, squeezing space and time, control of transitions and clarity in decisive moments have become more important than dominating by possession. All prepared in training by top managers and coaches.\"\n\nBalague pointed out that success in the league phase does not mean anything. The competition only really begins in the knockout rounds \"where English domination has been far less pronounced\".\n\nBut Balague added: \"In any case it feels almost impossible to stop for ever the domination of a league that brings every year double or more the income of other competitions.\"\n\nOf the seven meetings between German and English clubs in the league phase the Bundesliga clubs only picked up two victories.\n\nBut Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund are all through to the knockout stages, although only Bayern go straight into the last 16.\n\nGerman football expert Raphael Honigstein says few people are placing too much focus on the English success so far.\n\n\"The Premier League's dominance is just denoted as a matter of fact,\" Honigstein said.\n\n\"Kicker today wrote that the top eight reflect the hegemony [dominance] of the Premier League, or reinforces it. So it's just seen as a given.\"\n\nDortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt in the last week both lost to Spurs, who are languishing in 14th in the Premier League.\n\nIt is not just about the money but how it is being used too, though.\n\n\"The days of stupid English money are gone,\" Honigstein added. \"Suddeutsche Zeitung wrote that the Premier League had learned to actually use its riches more effectively, which explains their improved performances relative to recent years.\"\n\nHonigstein also said Borussia Monchengladbach and Qarabag having enjoyed success they could not not achieved in the old group-stage format.\n\nHe added: \"The fact that Inter and Paris St-Germain, last year's finalists, both didn't qualify for the top eight suggests that there is a healthy sense of competition and a bit of randomness.\n\n\"I haven't seen anyone make the link that the Premier League dominance somehow invalidates or diminishes the current format.\n\n\"That is again a very English obsession to think that everyone is always thinking about England. People are not.\"\n\nWhy have English teams dominated as Real & PSG face play-offs?\n\nEngland on course for fifth Champions League spot\n\nTrubin's 'miracle' - how Mourinho's Benfica stunned Real Madrid\n\nThe BBC World Service's Sport Today show debated the topic on Thursday.\n\nFilippo Ricci, the La Liga correspondent for Gazzetta dello Sport, said the best young stars now all go to England.\n\nRicci told the story of Carlos Vicente, who was considered to be Alaves' best player.

He joins Conor Bradley, Giovanni Leoni and Alexander Isak in the treatment room.\n\nCurtis Jones’ availability is unsure, having missed Wednesday’s game due to injury, as is Ibrahima Konate, who is still on leave following his father’s death.\n\nFabian Schar, Joelinton, Emil Krafth, and Tino Livramento are all sidelined through injury for the Magpies.\n\nLiverpool (4-2-3-1): Alisson Becker, Wataru Endo, Ryan Gravenberch, Virgil van Dijk, Milos Kerkez, Alexis McAllister, Dominic Szoboszlai, Florian Wirtz, Cody Gakpo Mohamed Salah, Hugo Ekitike.\n\nNewcastle (4-3-3): Nick Pope, Lewis Miley, Malick Thiaw, Sven Botman, Lewis Hall, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Jacob Ramsey, Antony Gordon, Nick Woltemade, Harvey Barnes.\n\nStats from whoscored.com & transfermarkt.com",

    "fullText": "The Premier League is flexing its muscles in Europe as five English teams finished in the top eight of the Champions League to reach the knockouts.\n\nThat could become six in the last-16 if Newcastle win their two-legged play-off after they finished 12th in the league phase following a 1-1 draw at defending champions PSG on Wednesday.\n\nArsenal finished in first place with Liverpool third, Tottenham fourth, Chelsea sixth and Manchester City finishing eighth.\n\nHistory could be made if Newcastle progress through the play-offs as never before have there been six Premier League teams in the Champions League knockouts.\n\n\"That is dominant,\" said Spurs boss Thomas Frank.\n\n\"I think we all said for a few years the Premier League is the best league in the world and I think this is another sign of it.\"\n\nSo why have Premier League sides been so dominant against Europe's elite?\n\nThe most obvious starting point is the financial power of the Premier League, which significantly outweighs other leagues.\n\nSix Premier League sides sit inside the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League, while 50% of the top 30 come from the English top flight.\n\nTV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.\n\nLast summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.\n\nTo highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent in the summer window was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.\n\nMore money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big to increase their strength in depth as they finished first in the league phase of the Champions League and sit top of the Premier League.\n\n\"The biggest single reason that the English clubs have been dominant so far is the financial power of the Premier League,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Also, it is about how competitive they have got by fighting it out and being in and around each other - they have pushed each other on.\"\n\nNewcastle forward Anthony Gordon also says a more open style of play in Europe has benefited English teams, while the Premier League is \"more physical than I've ever known it to be\".\n\n\"I think in the Champions League, teams are more open. They all try to play. It's less transitional,\" he added.\n\n\"It [the Premier League] is like a basketball game sometimes, it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's a running game and sometimes it's about duels, whoever wins the duels wins the game. Or moments.\n\n\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game, more football based. Teams come and try and play proper football.\n\n\"In the Premier League, you see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces - it's become a lot slower and more set piece based, I would say.\"\n\nWhen is the Champions League play-off draw and how does it work?\n\nLiverpool top English club in Deloitte Money League\n\nIt is undoubtedly an impressive achievement for five - and potentially six - Premier League teams to reach the knockouts.\n\nBut was the fixture computer kinder for them than other teams?\n\nAt the start of the season, football data statisticians Opta analysed every team's Champions League fixtures and ranked them all to work out who had the kindest draw.\n\nArsenal's fixtures were ranked the third easiest, with Tottenham fourth, Liverpool seventh and Chelsea eighth.\n\nManchester City were deemed to have the 14th easiest fixtures while Newcastle - who played defending champions Paris St-Germain - were 32nd in the rankings.\n\nThe last - and only - time five Premier League teams made it through to the knockouts was in 2017, when Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed.\n\nHowever just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to the final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.\n\nWith five Premier League sides finishing in the top eight of this season's league phase, and therefore avoiding the prospect of facing one another in the last-16, there is the chance of a record number of English teams making the quarter-finals.\n\nHaving numerous English clubs in latter stages of the Champions League is nothing new with four sides progressing to the quarters in both 2007-08 and 2008-09, as well as 2018-19 - leading to an all-English final in 07-08 and 2018-19.\n\nNo other country have ever had four teams in the quarter-finals - this year England could have as many as six.\n\nBut the demands of playing in the Premier League alongside the Champions League takes its toll, which is why many managers were relieved to avoid the two extra play-off games.\n\n\"I still think it will be very difficult for one of them to go on and win it, just because of how difficult the Premier League is every week - whether you are fighting for the title or for a place in the top four,\" Warnock added.\n\n\"Clearly the English clubs are in a good position going into the knockout stages, though. Some of the other big clubs that we thought would peak or start to show better form - like Paris St-Germain for example - have not really got going yet.\"\n\nThe three other countries who had teams join English sides in progressing to the knockouts were Germany (Bayern Munich), Spain (Barcelona) and Portugal (Sporting CP).\n\nThat has left some surprises having to go through via the play-offs, with Paris St-Germain failing to get the win they needed against Newcastle to secure a top-eight spot.\n\nReal Madrid, meanwhile, were on the wrong end of a thrilling and dramatic match with Benfica.\n\nReal were reduced to nine men while a last-second goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin secured a memorable 4-2 win for Jose Mourinho's side that earned them a play-off spot.\n\nOther big sides who are facing the lottery of the play-offs include Italian sides Juventus and Inter Milan, along with Germany's Borussia Dortmund and Spain's Atletico Madrid - who were stunned by Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday.\n\nThe Norwegians have been the surprise package of the Champions League and their win against Atletico came just eight days after they beat Manchester City.\n\nThose results meant they are into the play-offs and have become the first Norwegian side to progress from the league or group phase in Champions League since Rosenborg in 1996-97.\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "description": "There is the live possibility that all six of the Premier League clubs finish inside the top eight to qualify for the Champions League last 16, with English dominance on the European stage reflective of a shift in attitudes",
    "fullText": "In the buildup to Arsenal’s trip to Inter last week, those at their London Colney training base couldn’t help notice a shift in mood. There was no tension, it was all rather relaxed. A largely second-string team then carried that onto the pitch by breezing through a 3-1 away win against last season’s finalists. Long-time club insiders couldn’t help contrasting to 20 or even 15 years ago.\n\n“No pressure going to the San Siro for a Champions League game – imagine that.”\n\nNeedless to say, it wasn’t like that for the Premier League games either side of that win. And while some of that may be distinctive to Arsenal’s first place and a complex about winning the title, it is actually a common feeling.\n\nLiverpool’s many problems have been much less pronounced in the Champions League, where they can still stamp on Real Madrid or go to a stadium as intimidating as Olympique Marseille’s Velodrome and pick off a win.\n\nManchester City may admittedly have more angst after Bodo-Glimt, but they’d probably have taken a home match against Galatasaray to secure automatic qualification before this began. Newcastle United have meanwhile been much less inconsistent, as Tottenham Hotspur have been a force. Most starkly, Burnley and West Ham United posed more difficult challenges than Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAnd this is where there has been a very definite shift.\n\nOne source relates a common view. “The Premier League is now psychologically and tactically more challenging than the Champions League.”\n\nThe European games are described as much less tense. Crisis clubs now look forward to the refresh of a Champions League week, a total inversion of 30 years ago.\n\nSuch claims will almost sound sacrilegious to anyone who grew up steeped in the competition’s mythology from that time, as this really isn’t what the Champions League is supposed to be about. It’s cast as the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nClubs that properly have qualification in the balance – like Antonio Conte’s Napoli – will obviously feel different, but that points to another major factor.\n\nOne is a long-term structural issue that these pages have discussed so much over the years. The Premier League has so much more collective wealth, as can be seen with how Marseille’s total revenue is lower than that of 14 English clubs, and close to half of Villa’s wage bill. Such forces have created a talent drain from everywhere else. Essentially, any time anyone starts to do anything good – and this is especially true as regards coaching – they are snapped up by an English club.\n\nThe only exception seems to be with the majority of truly elite stars. In what looks like a necessary counterbalance, such players – from Kylian Mbappe to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – are still attracted to the glamour of the European super clubs, who also tend to accommodate their wage structures accordingly. Some Premier League figures feel this is the one remaining area where the English competition is missing out, as if it doesn’t already have enough.\n\nIt is very much a coach’s league, though, as recent articles about the effect of pressing and set pieces on goals have illustrated. Many of the major Champions League clubs don’t have to think about this in the same way, repeatedly leading to the bizarre scenes of Arne Slot declaring his delight that European opposition don’t play in a low block.\n\nThey might have to start thinking about it if English dominance continues – but the wonder is how far that goes.\n\nAs we go into the grand television event that is the final group night – intended to make all of this worthwhile – there is the live possibility that all six of the English clubs qualify as part of the top eight. Arsenal are already all but confirmed as top.\n\nEven if all six don’t qualify, it says enough that it’s a distinctive prospect, to say nothing that six clubs from one country is already too much anyway.\n\nThere are figures at the top of Uefa who readily complain about how the “European space” was made impossible by Bosman and an economic context that ensures a concentration of wealth to an ever-narrowing area of the game, although questions could then be asked about decisions made and regulation.\n\nThis very Champions League model was partly intended to be a regulatory response to all this, but it might well have had the adverse effect.\n\nSo much of the competition feels like the stakes are so low. Even this week, Napoli vs Chelsea is one of the few matches that feels “big”, but it’s not like it’s a straight knockout: Chelsea have the safety net.\n\nIt’s another contrast with the Premier League. For all the bombast of the competition, there is constant noise and narrative around it; with these Champions League matches, many of them feel like filler with little consequence.\n\nBecause, no matter how you try to talk around it, even a Paris Saint-Germain vs Newcastle United that is about automatic qualification won’t feel the same as sudden death.\n\nTake the example of that Spurs vs Dortmund match. Would it have felt quite so forgiving for Spurs if it were a knockout? The energy would have been completely different. Dortmund themselves would surely have looked different, and perhaps prepared a more layered gameplan than something that just felt like it was for a weekly league match.\n\nAnd yet these strange stakes may also work another way.\n\nIt’s been said before, but there is a considerable irony to how the “prize” for the top eight is to avoid an extra two “punishment” fixtures, when the entire point of this expanded Champions League is that the wealthy clubs actively wanted more games. Arsenal badly needed a free midweek, so they played for it.\n\nWhat does that say about the football calendar and its effects?\n\nHence, a mere two English winners in this decade so far, despite all that wealth. Premier League teams get to the business end too exhausted, and after so much more competitive tension in their domestic league, where the European super clubs’ greater stars finally have that space to excel.\n\nLook at the fate of last year’s group winners, Liverpool. Arsenal might have to be conscious of that.\n\nPSG’s victory in the final, meanwhile, only fosters the sense that very little of this matters that much, even allowing for changes that mean knockout home games will be dictated by the table.\n\nWednesday night will, of course, still be fun. Goals will rain in. The table will constantly change, even if that works against any sense of drama, as there’s much to keep up with.\n\nThe Champions League is supposed to be about so much more than that, though. And it’s supposed to be about much more than a handful of clubs.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have not won the Premier League since Antonio Conte led them to the 2016-17 title - and facing the Italian's Napoli side on Wednesday brings that into sharp focus.\n\nConte's triumph came in the season when Pep Guardiola began his reign as Manchester City boss.\n\nIt was Conte's first campaign in England, too, and Chelsea enjoyed a club-record 13 consecutive league wins on their way to lifting the championship with 93 points.\n\nTheir fifth Premier League crown in 13 seasons matched Manchester United's achievement in that same period. Chelsea - or indeed United - haven't ruled the roost since, amid an extensive turnover of players and coaches.\n\nNine years down the line, we reach a dramatic finale to the Champions League's opening phase. Liam Rosenior's Chelsea need a win against Conte's Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona to go directly into the last-16 stage. Their hosts - Serie A champions last season - must win to stay in the competition.\n\nLike so many aspects of Chelsea's recent history, you'd struggle to write this script.\n\nThomas Tuchel's Champions League triumph in 2021, plus two Club World Cup titles, have been notable achievements since Conte's departure.\n\nBut in strictly Premier League terms, the peak of Conte's short stint at the wheel has not been repeated at Chelsea. They haven't really come close.\n\nRosenior, 41, is the latest of seven head coaches, not including interim appointments, to have led Chelsea since Conte was sacked in July 2018. He has been in post for a matter of weeks.\n\nSpeaking about Conte on Tuesday in Naples, Rosenior said: \"I have huge respect for him. Firstly as a player, he was a magnificent footballer. He then went on to - and still has - an incredible career as a coach.\n\n\"I think his passion as a player transmits to the passion in his teams and obviously when I was younger watching Chelsea play in the manner that they did, defensively so strong.\n\n\"[Eden] Hazard was incredible in those moments, and he [Conte] has gone on to prove what an amazing manager he is and he's won many titles, including an incredible title here last year.\"",

    "fullText": "Needing a positive result to avoid the Champions League knockout play-offs, Galatasaray are not the side Manchester City would choose to face.\n\nIn four recent meetings between Premier League clubs and the Turkish giants, Galatasaray are unbeaten. You must go back to December 2014 – a 4-1 win for Arsenal in Istanbul – for the last time an English side triumphed.\n\nIn 2023, Galatasaray finished above Manchester United in their Champions League group – sending Erik ten Hag's men packing in last place – thanks to a 3-2 win in their most recent visit to the north-west before taking on Manchester City this Wednesday (20:00 GMT).\n\nA chaotic 3-3 draw in Turkey followed. Then last season, they inflicted the only Europa League group phase defeat on eventual champions Tottenham.\n\nMost recently, earlier in this Champions League campaign, Galatasaray outplayed an off-colour Liverpool to win 1-0 thanks to Victor Osimhen's first half penalty.\n\nSo why do Cimbom – the enigmatic nickname for Turkey's most successful football club – have such a good record against English teams?\n\nAccording to assistant manager Ismael Garcia Gomez, it is because the Turkish league is the most English outside England – and Galatasaray is the most English Turkish club of all.\n\n\"I think sometimes with the more dynamic, transitional games we face against teams from England, we are very used to that,\" Garcia Gomez told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The Turkish league is not at the same level, but we are more Premier League than all other European leagues, more than Italy and Spain where the tempo is lower. English teams, the ones we face, we feel comfortable because they are open.\n\n\"I have never had the experience of working in English men's football, but I have experienced it as a fan. England is for the fans, the football for fans is the best.\n\n\"But Turkey, it has nothing to be jealous about. The atmosphere created in stadiums is amazing, I was fortunate enough to work across Europe, and the passion here is at the same level as any country we can name.\"",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nEmiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): Wonderful performance. It says 2-0 on the scoresheet, but if you watched the game it felt like Newcastle had the better chances. An xG of 2.18 for Newcastle and they didn't score so that comes down to him.\n\nIan Maatsen (Aston Villa): He hasn't actually been a regular. He does so much going forward for Villa with his crossing. He's not really known for his defending but I thought he shackled Harvey Barnes and put him in his back pocket.\n\nOla Aina (Nottingham Forest): The Brentford team he faced are well known for getting crosses in from the wide areas. I thought he defended excellently at the far post in Forest's 2-0 win, cleared everything. He was good at dealing with how people tried to run at him. He offered a lot going forward, too.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City): I know it's Wolves, so he gets a little less credit, but to instantly come in and get a clean sheet, you just saw the togetherness he brings. A lot of pressure on him going into a game where they have to win. He comes in and City get their first clean sheet in the Premier League since 1 January.\n\nJorge Cuenca (Fulham): A lot of people talk about Joachim Andersen and his range of passing. Cuenca is just steady and goes about his business, but he's always in control, never out of position - and again against Brighton. Very talented player.\n\nYouri Tielemans (Aston Villa): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile. He's slowly become Villa's most important player. He dictates the play, breaks it up, and does everything right. Very, very good player and that pains me to say as a Birmingham City fan.\n\nIbrahim Sangare (Nottingham Forest): Lost him during Afcon and it wasn't the same midfield. He is a pitbull next to Elliot Anderson; he does all of the ugly stuff and breaks it up. A fantastic footballer and part of a solid defensive unit, which obviously Forest needed.\n\nEmiliano Buendia (Aston Villa): Scored unbelievable goals, all vital for their team's attacking outlet. Buendia, for me, just showed that little bit of class and magic. I love to see players taking a risk.\n\nPatrick Dorgu (Manchester United): He's been unbelievable since Michael Carrick came in. That goal in the win at Arsenal was unbelievable and worthy of winning any football match in the world.\n\nEstevao Willian (Chelsea): Young, exciting player and got a goal and assist, but it was against Crystal Palace, so he doesn't get as much chat as the others.\n\nIgor Jesus (Nottingham Forest): In a weekend of strikers not being great, he was solid and Forest had two that ended up scoring. He battles and does all the ugly stuff well, and then he has that little bit of flair for his goal.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo (West Ham): A 3-1 win over Sunderland is huge - it gives West Ham a chance to stay up. If you look at the wins for Forest and now the draw for Leeds, West Ham would have been completely cut adrift. They've now given themselves a chance to get out of it. He gets that because of the biggest win of the weekend.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Former Premier League striker Alan Shearer has blasted Ruben Amorim, branding him “arrogant” after Manchester United’s thrilling victory over Arsenal.\n\nAmorim was sacked earlier this month after 14 months in charge as head coach. He led United to a lowly 15th-place finish last season and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur, but was still backed significantly in the summer and afforded more time to turn things around.\n\nWhile results saw a slight improvement this season, he remained dogmatically committed to his controversial 3-4-2-1 formation. He reverted to a back four on only one occasion, against Newcastle, and United won. Surprisingly, he then retreated to the three-at-the-back system that had put him at loggerheads with the media and supporters.\n\nSkirmishes between Amorim and the football leadership group reached a breaking point after the 1-1 draw with Leeds, leading to Amorim’s dismissal.\n\nMichael Carrick was brought in to replace the Portuguese and so far, the change has worked a treat. Carrick secured a dominant 2-0 win over Manchester City in his first game and followed that up with an incredible 3-2 victory against Arsenal last Sunday.\n\nIn both games against the top two teams in the Premier League, United were by far the better side and were deserving winners. The result vs. Arsenal catapulted Carrick and his players to fourth positions and in a strong position to secure Champions League football.\n\nSpeaking on The Rest is Football podcast, Shearer, Micah Richards, and Gary Lineker credited Carrick for the positive change while simultaneously scrutinising Amorim’s methods.\n\nLineker began, “It’s funny football, isn’t it? Because suddenly you go back to a system that perhaps suits some of the players. You bring back bit of experience in Harry Maguire, you bring back one of the star players in Kobbie Mainoo, and play him in there.”\n\n“You push Bruno [Fernandes] a little bit further forward where he’s a little bit more comfortable and can bring out his brilliance more. You get Amad playing as a winger and not as a wing back. And all of a sudden, it’s very strange, but things start to happen for you.”\n\nRichards added, “We kept saying it continuously, the players were playing out of position. Two number 10s, [Amad] Diallo in a number 10, [Bryan] Mbeumo in the number 10, why? They do the most damage from wide positions. I know Mbeumo is playing up front now, but he’s got the freedom to go where he wants.”\n\n“If you see the goals of Cunha and Dorgu, they are brave goals there, getting on the ball on the half turn and then driving, trying to make something happen.”\n\nJoining the conversation, Shearer questioned, “What on earth is Ruben Amorim sat doing, thinking, looking at those two performances? I mean honestly, I don’t know what he’ll be thinking.”\n\nLineker answered, “He’ll be thinking ‘Maybe I’ve got it wrong?'”\n\nRichards chimed in, “You buy into managers, because of what he did at sporting and it worked very well. Subconsciously you’re thinking, ‘Okay, we’ll give him a little bit more time,’ because it’s worked before. He’s come to a different league. He’s got players who can’t play in those positions, and we’re still waiting, giving him the benefit of doubt.”\n\n“But he got a result, playing 4231, and then he changed back to three at the back. It was madness.”\n\nShearer continued, “Yeah, absolutely crazy. The arrogance to say, ‘No, I’m not doing any other thing. This is my way or the highway.’ I mean, to not even shift or to accept that this is probably not working, ‘Maybe I should try something else.’ He put all his eggs into that basket, and if that didn’t work, he was done. And it didn’t.”\n\nThe trio discussed whether Carrick should be under consideration to be handed the job permanently.\n\nLineker joked that United should immediately offer their former midfielder a contract. Shearer insisted that it’s too early to reach any conclusions and that things will become clearer with time.\n\nCrucially, Lineker warned that tougher challenges await. He noted that while it is easy to be motivated for marquee fixtures against City and Arsenal, the true test of progress will be United’s ability to break down defensive, low-block teams.\n\nUnited are next in action on Sunday when they welcome Fulham to Old Trafford.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche wants the Premier League to ban towels from the sidelines after complaining about the time taken for throw-ins during his side's 2-0 win at Brentford.\n\nDyche believes it is taking too long for teams to get organised for what is essentially now a full-blown set-piece, particularly when throwers opt to dry the ball before hurling it into the box.\n\nBrentford's Michael Kayode was regularly seen reaching for a towel before launching one of his throws towards the Forest area on Sunday.\n\n\"They have towels on the sidelines. I can't work that out,\" Dyche said in his post-match news conference.\n\n\"Nothing against Brentford. It's the rules. How can a home team be allowed to decide if they have towels on the sidelines or not?\"\n\nPremier League guidelines state that towels can only be used provided they are made available to both teams at all times.\n\nDyche's complaint is that, in effect, the away team have no real say in the matter - if the hosts want to use towels they just have to do so equitably.\n\nIt is a different story in the EFL, which banned the use of towels or anything else to dry a ball before the 2023-24 season.\n\nDyche said: \"Why not in the Premier League, just go, no towels, just get on with the game? It just adds in another layer of things for us to talk about and for us to worry about.\n\n\"Just say no towels. Dead easy, isn't it? It's not rocket science. Why make it more complicated? It's unfathomable to me.\"",

    "fullText": "Vincent Kompany is still learning on his job.\n\nThe 39-year-old, now in his second season at Bayern Munich, is still in the early part of his managerial career, which began only in 2020. In that time he’s overseen highs and lows, having both taken Burnley to promotion and suffering relegation from the Premier League.\n\n“I don’t think that winning titles makes you a good coach, or getting relegated makes you a bad one,” Kompany reflected in remarks captured by @iMiaSanMia. “A good coach is someone who learns something new every year, regardless of whether we win or lose.\n\n“We’re in a good position right now; it’s all about the details. We simply want to be competitive. We want to prepare well for the matches where trophies are at stake, where it’s about going through or being eliminated. In those moments, we have to have the big players fit because they’re the ones who decide the games for us.”\n\nWhat else is there to say? You have to love Kompany’s mindset. It is no surprise, given who he is and how he approaches his work, that he has found success at Bayern. Now the club is reflecting these attitudes in just about every way: every day, a little step forward.\n\nAnd this year? The stars seem to be lining up for the Bavarians. It would be a surprise to see them not go far in the Champions League.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Sunday's win at Arsenal was another unbelievable result for Manchester United and I was hugely impressed with the way they got it.\n\nJust like in last weekend's Manchester derby, ultimately this victory came down to the fact that their big players are turning up for them now. For example, when you go down the spine of the United team at Emirates Stadium, they all looked like the players we know they are.\n\nHarry Maguire was brilliant at the back, then you had Casemiro in the middle of the park, using all his experience. Bruno Fernandes, back in his favourite position as a number 10, was outstanding, and up front Bryan Mbeumo was a goal threat, but also able to hold the ball up, and scared people with his pace and energy.\n\nUnited scored two brilliant goals, but their victory did not rely on outstanding individual performances or moments.\n\nInstead, the whole team played their part in this win, and manager Michael Carrick deserves credit for finding a way of making that happen.",

The pressure was on Arsenal today,\" former Manchester United captain Roy Keane said on Sky Sports.\n\n\"They'll have seen the other results, they're in a great position, they've got everything going for them... but it's pressure.\n\n\"They're feeling the pressure and it's how they deal with it over the next month or two. That's what's cost them over the last few years.\n\n\"I can't believe they don't look like a confident team for where they are in the league. They've got to get back to basics and start embracing this challenge instead of being frightened of it.\"\n\nTop of the table and with everything in their hands, the Gunners have been here before. They have finished runners-up in each of the past three seasons.\n\nIs this latest wobble a sign of things to come? Not necessarily.",
