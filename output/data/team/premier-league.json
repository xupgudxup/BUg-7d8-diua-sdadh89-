Does it denigrate the new format? And why are Premier League clubs proving so powerful?\n\nSpain, which like England gained one of the two European Performance Spots for this season, has not fared well so far.\n\nOnly Barcelona are sure of the being in the last 16, with Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in the playoff round. Athletic Club and Villarreal have been eliminated.\n\nWhereas Spanish clubs used to dominate in Europe - Real Madrid won the competition twice in the past four seasons - this time they lost all but one of 10 meetings against Premier League teams in the group stage. La Liga clubs failed to score in seven matches and were beaten by an aggregate score of 21-5.\n\nBBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague describes it as \"a near-perfect storm\" which has been driven by \"collective wealth, elite decision-making off the pitch, plus a league environment that forces constant tactical evolution\".\n\nBalague added: \"The Premier League has the biggest budgets, but also professional structures - recruitment departments, data analysis, coaching teams and sporting directors - all working at a level that allows clubs to choose better profiles of players and managers.\n\n\"There is an advantage even before a ball is kicked.\"\n\nBalague believes only Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich can match English clubs in all the four areas of \"organised attack, structured defence, attacking transition and defensive transition\".\n\nEnglish clubs are now fully attuned to the European style, Balague says.\n\n\"Rather than imposing something radically different, they are adapting to what Europe now requires,\" he explained.\n\n\"Defensive composure, winning the duels, squeezing space and time, control of transitions and clarity in decisive moments have become more important than dominating by possession. All prepared in training by top managers and coaches.\"\n\nBalague pointed out that success in the league phase does not mean anything. The competition only really begins in the knockout rounds \"where English domination has been far less pronounced\".\n\nBut Balague added: \"In any case it feels almost impossible to stop for ever the domination of a league that brings every year double or more the income of other competitions.\"\n\nOf the seven meetings between German and English clubs in the league phase the Bundesliga clubs only picked up two victories.\n\nBut Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund are all through to the knockout stages, although only Bayern go straight into the last 16.\n\nGerman football expert Raphael Honigstein says few people are placing too much focus on the English success so far.\n\n\"The Premier League's dominance is just denoted as a matter of fact,\" Honigstein said.\n\n\"Kicker today wrote that the top eight reflect the hegemony [dominance] of the Premier League, or reinforces it. So it's just seen as a given.\"\n\nDortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt in the last week both lost to Spurs, who are languishing in 14th in the Premier League.\n\nIt is not just about the money but how it is being used too, though.\n\n\"The days of stupid English money are gone,\" Honigstein added. \"Suddeutsche Zeitung wrote that the Premier League had learned to actually use its riches more effectively, which explains their improved performances relative to recent years.\"\n\nHonigstein also said Borussia Monchengladbach and Qarabag having enjoyed success they could not not achieved in the old group-stage format.\n\nHe added: \"The fact that Inter and Paris St-Germain, last year's finalists, both didn't qualify for the top eight suggests that there is a healthy sense of competition and a bit of randomness.\n\n\"I haven't seen anyone make the link that the Premier League dominance somehow invalidates or diminishes the current format.\n\n\"That is again a very English obsession to think that everyone is always thinking about England. People are not.\"\n\nWhy have English teams dominated as Real & PSG face play-offs?\n\nEngland on course for fifth Champions League spot\n\nTrubin's 'miracle' - how Mourinho's Benfica stunned Real Madrid\n\nThe BBC World Service's Sport Today show debated the topic on Thursday.\n\nFilippo Ricci, the La Liga correspondent for Gazzetta dello Sport, said the best young stars now all go to England.\n\nRicci told the story of Carlos Vicente, who was considered to be Alaves' best player.

He joins Conor Bradley, Giovanni Leoni and Alexander Isak in the treatment room.\n\nCurtis Jones’ availability is unsure, having missed Wednesday’s game due to injury, as is Ibrahima Konate, who is still on leave following his father’s death.\n\nFabian Schar, Joelinton, Emil Krafth, and Tino Livramento are all sidelined through injury for the Magpies.\n\nLiverpool (4-2-3-1): Alisson Becker, Wataru Endo, Ryan Gravenberch, Virgil van Dijk, Milos Kerkez, Alexis McAllister, Dominic Szoboszlai, Florian Wirtz, Cody Gakpo Mohamed Salah, Hugo Ekitike.\n\nNewcastle (4-3-3): Nick Pope, Lewis Miley, Malick Thiaw, Sven Botman, Lewis Hall, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Jacob Ramsey, Antony Gordon, Nick Woltemade, Harvey Barnes.\n\nStats from whoscored.com & transfermarkt.com",

    "description": "Five of the eight teams to qualify automatically for the Champions League were from the Premier League, so why have they been so dominant?",
    "fullText": "The Premier League is flexing its muscles in Europe as five English teams finished in the top eight of the Champions League to reach the knockouts.\n\nThat could become six in the last-16 if Newcastle win their two-legged play-off after they finished 12th in the league phase following a 1-1 draw at defending champions PSG on Wednesday.\n\nArsenal finished in first place with Liverpool third, Tottenham fourth, Chelsea sixth and Manchester City finishing eighth.\n\nHistory could be made if Newcastle progress through the play-offs as never before have there been six Premier League teams in the Champions League knockouts.\n\n\"That is dominant,\" said Spurs boss Thomas Frank.\n\n\"I think we all said for a few years the Premier League is the best league in the world and I think this is another sign of it.\"\n\nSo why have Premier League sides been so dominant against Europe's elite?\n\nThe most obvious starting point is the financial power of the Premier League, which significantly outweighs other leagues.\n\nSix Premier League sides sit inside the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League, while 50% of the top 30 come from the English top flight.\n\nTV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.\n\nLast summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.\n\nTo highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent in the summer window was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.\n\nMore money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big to increase their strength in depth as they finished first in the league phase of the Champions League and sit top of the Premier League.\n\n\"The biggest single reason that the English clubs have been dominant so far is the financial power of the Premier League,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Also, it is about how competitive they have got by fighting it out and being in and around each other - they have pushed each other on.\"\n\nNewcastle forward Anthony Gordon also says a more open style of play in Europe has benefited English teams, while the Premier League is \"more physical than I've ever known it to be\".\n\n\"I think in the Champions League, teams are more open. They all try to play. It's less transitional,\" he added.\n\n\"It [the Premier League] is like a basketball game sometimes, it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's a running game and sometimes it's about duels, whoever wins the duels wins the game. Or moments.\n\n\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game, more football based. Teams come and try and play proper football.\n\n\"In the Premier League, you see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces - it's become a lot slower and more set piece based, I would say.\"\n\nWhen is the Champions League play-off draw and how does it work?\n\nLiverpool top English club in Deloitte Money League\n\nIt is undoubtedly an impressive achievement for five - and potentially six - Premier League teams to reach the knockouts.\n\nBut was the fixture computer kinder for them than other teams?\n\nAt the start of the season, football data statisticians Opta analysed every team's Champions League fixtures and ranked them all to work out who had the kindest draw.\n\nArsenal's fixtures were ranked the third easiest, with Tottenham fourth, Liverpool seventh and Chelsea eighth.\n\nManchester City were deemed to have the 14th easiest fixtures while Newcastle - who played defending champions Paris St-Germain - were 32nd in the rankings.\n\nThe last - and only - time five Premier League teams made it through to the knockouts was in 2017, when Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed.\n\nHowever just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to the final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.\n\nWith five Premier League sides finishing in the top eight of this season's league phase, and therefore avoiding the prospect of facing one another in the last-16, there is the chance of a record number of English teams making the quarter-finals.\n\nHaving numerous English clubs in latter stages of the Champions League is nothing new with four sides progressing to the quarters in both 2007-08 and 2008-09, as well as 2018-19 - leading to an all-English final in 07-08 and 2018-19.\n\nNo other country have ever had four teams in the quarter-finals - this year England could have as many as six.\n\nBut the demands of playing in the Premier League alongside the Champions League takes its toll, which is why many managers were relieved to avoid the two extra play-off games.\n\n\"I still think it will be very difficult for one of them to go on and win it, just because of how difficult the Premier League is every week - whether you are fighting for the title or for a place in the top four,\" Warnock added.\n\n\"Clearly the English clubs are in a good position going into the knockout stages, though. Some of the other big clubs that we thought would peak or start to show better form - like Paris St-Germain for example - have not really got going yet.\"\n\nThe three other countries who had teams join English sides in progressing to the knockouts were Germany (Bayern Munich), Spain (Barcelona) and Portugal (Sporting CP).\n\nThat has left some surprises having to go through via the play-offs, with Paris St-Germain failing to get the win they needed against Newcastle to secure a top-eight spot.\n\nReal Madrid, meanwhile, were on the wrong end of a thrilling and dramatic match with Benfica.\n\nReal were reduced to nine men while a last-second goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin secured a memorable 4-2 win for Jose Mourinho's side that earned them a play-off spot.\n\nOther big sides who are facing the lottery of the play-offs include Italian sides Juventus and Inter Milan, along with Germany's Borussia Dortmund and Spain's Atletico Madrid - who were stunned by Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday.\n\nThe Norwegians have been the surprise package of the Champions League and their win against Atletico came just eight days after they beat Manchester City.\n\nThose results meant they are into the play-offs and have become the first Norwegian side to progress from the league or group phase in Champions League since Rosenborg in 1996-97.\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "description": "There is the live possibility that all six of the Premier League clubs finish inside the top eight to qualify for the Champions League last 16, with English dominance on the European stage reflective of a shift in attitudes",
    "fullText": "In the buildup to Arsenal’s trip to Inter last week, those at their London Colney training base couldn’t help notice a shift in mood. There was no tension, it was all rather relaxed. A largely second-string team then carried that onto the pitch by breezing through a 3-1 away win against last season’s finalists. Long-time club insiders couldn’t help contrasting to 20 or even 15 years ago.\n\n“No pressure going to the San Siro for a Champions League game – imagine that.”\n\nNeedless to say, it wasn’t like that for the Premier League games either side of that win. And while some of that may be distinctive to Arsenal’s first place and a complex about winning the title, it is actually a common feeling.\n\nLiverpool’s many problems have been much less pronounced in the Champions League, where they can still stamp on Real Madrid or go to a stadium as intimidating as Olympique Marseille’s Velodrome and pick off a win.\n\nManchester City may admittedly have more angst after Bodo-Glimt, but they’d probably have taken a home match against Galatasaray to secure automatic qualification before this began. Newcastle United have meanwhile been much less inconsistent, as Tottenham Hotspur have been a force. Most starkly, Burnley and West Ham United posed more difficult challenges than Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAnd this is where there has been a very definite shift.\n\nOne source relates a common view. “The Premier League is now psychologically and tactically more challenging than the Champions League.”\n\nThe European games are described as much less tense. Crisis clubs now look forward to the refresh of a Champions League week, a total inversion of 30 years ago.\n\nSuch claims will almost sound sacrilegious to anyone who grew up steeped in the competition’s mythology from that time, as this really isn’t what the Champions League is supposed to be about. It’s cast as the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nClubs that properly have qualification in the balance – like Antonio Conte’s Napoli – will obviously feel different, but that points to another major factor.\n\nOne is a long-term structural issue that these pages have discussed so much over the years. The Premier League has so much more collective wealth, as can be seen with how Marseille’s total revenue is lower than that of 14 English clubs, and close to half of Villa’s wage bill. Such forces have created a talent drain from everywhere else. Essentially, any time anyone starts to do anything good – and this is especially true as regards coaching – they are snapped up by an English club.\n\nThe only exception seems to be with the majority of truly elite stars. In what looks like a necessary counterbalance, such players – from Kylian Mbappe to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – are still attracted to the glamour of the European super clubs, who also tend to accommodate their wage structures accordingly. Some Premier League figures feel this is the one remaining area where the English competition is missing out, as if it doesn’t already have enough.\n\nIt is very much a coach’s league, though, as recent articles about the effect of pressing and set pieces on goals have illustrated. Many of the major Champions League clubs don’t have to think about this in the same way, repeatedly leading to the bizarre scenes of Arne Slot declaring his delight that European opposition don’t play in a low block.\n\nThey might have to start thinking about it if English dominance continues – but the wonder is how far that goes.\n\nAs we go into the grand television event that is the final group night – intended to make all of this worthwhile – there is the live possibility that all six of the English clubs qualify as part of the top eight. Arsenal are already all but confirmed as top.\n\nEven if all six don’t qualify, it says enough that it’s a distinctive prospect, to say nothing that six clubs from one country is already too much anyway.\n\nThere are figures at the top of Uefa who readily complain about how the “European space” was made impossible by Bosman and an economic context that ensures a concentration of wealth to an ever-narrowing area of the game, although questions could then be asked about decisions made and regulation.\n\nThis very Champions League model was partly intended to be a regulatory response to all this, but it might well have had the adverse effect.\n\nSo much of the competition feels like the stakes are so low. Even this week, Napoli vs Chelsea is one of the few matches that feels “big”, but it’s not like it’s a straight knockout: Chelsea have the safety net.\n\nIt’s another contrast with the Premier League. For all the bombast of the competition, there is constant noise and narrative around it; with these Champions League matches, many of them feel like filler with little consequence.\n\nBecause, no matter how you try to talk around it, even a Paris Saint-Germain vs Newcastle United that is about automatic qualification won’t feel the same as sudden death.\n\nTake the example of that Spurs vs Dortmund match. Would it have felt quite so forgiving for Spurs if it were a knockout? The energy would have been completely different. Dortmund themselves would surely have looked different, and perhaps prepared a more layered gameplan than something that just felt like it was for a weekly league match.\n\nAnd yet these strange stakes may also work another way.\n\nIt’s been said before, but there is a considerable irony to how the “prize” for the top eight is to avoid an extra two “punishment” fixtures, when the entire point of this expanded Champions League is that the wealthy clubs actively wanted more games. Arsenal badly needed a free midweek, so they played for it.\n\nWhat does that say about the football calendar and its effects?\n\nHence, a mere two English winners in this decade so far, despite all that wealth. Premier League teams get to the business end too exhausted, and after so much more competitive tension in their domestic league, where the European super clubs’ greater stars finally have that space to excel.\n\nLook at the fate of last year’s group winners, Liverpool. Arsenal might have to be conscious of that.\n\nPSG’s victory in the final, meanwhile, only fosters the sense that very little of this matters that much, even allowing for changes that mean knockout home games will be dictated by the table.\n\nWednesday night will, of course, still be fun. Goals will rain in. The table will constantly change, even if that works against any sense of drama, as there’s much to keep up with.\n\nThe Champions League is supposed to be about so much more than that, though. And it’s supposed to be about much more than a handful of clubs.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have not won the Premier League since Antonio Conte led them to the 2016-17 title - and facing the Italian's Napoli side on Wednesday brings that into sharp focus.\n\nConte's triumph came in the season when Pep Guardiola began his reign as Manchester City boss.\n\nIt was Conte's first campaign in England, too, and Chelsea enjoyed a club-record 13 consecutive league wins on their way to lifting the championship with 93 points.\n\nTheir fifth Premier League crown in 13 seasons matched Manchester United's achievement in that same period. Chelsea - or indeed United - haven't ruled the roost since, amid an extensive turnover of players and coaches.\n\nNine years down the line, we reach a dramatic finale to the Champions League's opening phase. Liam Rosenior's Chelsea need a win against Conte's Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona to go directly into the last-16 stage. Their hosts - Serie A champions last season - must win to stay in the competition.\n\nLike so many aspects of Chelsea's recent history, you'd struggle to write this script.\n\nThomas Tuchel's Champions League triumph in 2021, plus two Club World Cup titles, have been notable achievements since Conte's departure.\n\nBut in strictly Premier League terms, the peak of Conte's short stint at the wheel has not been repeated at Chelsea. They haven't really come close.\n\nRosenior, 41, is the latest of seven head coaches, not including interim appointments, to have led Chelsea since Conte was sacked in July 2018. He has been in post for a matter of weeks.\n\nSpeaking about Conte on Tuesday in Naples, Rosenior said: \"I have huge respect for him. Firstly as a player, he was a magnificent footballer. He then went on to - and still has - an incredible career as a coach.\n\n\"I think his passion as a player transmits to the passion in his teams and obviously when I was younger watching Chelsea play in the manner that they did, defensively so strong.\n\n\"[Eden] Hazard was incredible in those moments, and he [Conte] has gone on to prove what an amazing manager he is and he's won many titles, including an incredible title here last year.\"",

    "fullText": "Needing a positive result to avoid the Champions League knockout play-offs, Galatasaray are not the side Manchester City would choose to face.\n\nIn four recent meetings between Premier League clubs and the Turkish giants, Galatasaray are unbeaten. You must go back to December 2014 – a 4-1 win for Arsenal in Istanbul – for the last time an English side triumphed.\n\nIn 2023, Galatasaray finished above Manchester United in their Champions League group – sending Erik ten Hag's men packing in last place – thanks to a 3-2 win in their most recent visit to the north-west before taking on Manchester City this Wednesday (20:00 GMT).\n\nA chaotic 3-3 draw in Turkey followed. Then last season, they inflicted the only Europa League group phase defeat on eventual champions Tottenham.\n\nMost recently, earlier in this Champions League campaign, Galatasaray outplayed an off-colour Liverpool to win 1-0 thanks to Victor Osimhen's first half penalty.\n\nSo why do Cimbom – the enigmatic nickname for Turkey's most successful football club – have such a good record against English teams?\n\nAccording to assistant manager Ismael Garcia Gomez, it is because the Turkish league is the most English outside England – and Galatasaray is the most English Turkish club of all.\n\n\"I think sometimes with the more dynamic, transitional games we face against teams from England, we are very used to that,\" Garcia Gomez told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The Turkish league is not at the same level, but we are more Premier League than all other European leagues, more than Italy and Spain where the tempo is lower. English teams, the ones we face, we feel comfortable because they are open.\n\n\"I have never had the experience of working in English men's football, but I have experienced it as a fan. England is for the fans, the football for fans is the best.\n\n\"But Turkey, it has nothing to be jealous about. The atmosphere created in stadiums is amazing, I was fortunate enough to work across Europe, and the passion here is at the same level as any country we can name.\"",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nEmiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): Wonderful performance. It says 2-0 on the scoresheet, but if you watched the game it felt like Newcastle had the better chances. An xG of 2.18 for Newcastle and they didn't score so that comes down to him.\n\nIan Maatsen (Aston Villa): He hasn't actually been a regular. He does so much going forward for Villa with his crossing. He's not really known for his defending but I thought he shackled Harvey Barnes and put him in his back pocket.\n\nOla Aina (Nottingham Forest): The Brentford team he faced are well known for getting crosses in from the wide areas. I thought he defended excellently at the far post in Forest's 2-0 win, cleared everything. He was good at dealing with how people tried to run at him. He offered a lot going forward, too.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City): I know it's Wolves, so he gets a little less credit, but to instantly come in and get a clean sheet, you just saw the togetherness he brings. A lot of pressure on him going into a game where they have to win. He comes in and City get their first clean sheet in the Premier League since 1 January.\n\nJorge Cuenca (Fulham): A lot of people talk about Joachim Andersen and his range of passing. Cuenca is just steady and goes about his business, but he's always in control, never out of position - and again against Brighton. Very talented player.\n\nYouri Tielemans (Aston Villa): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile. He's slowly become Villa's most important player. He dictates the play, breaks it up, and does everything right. Very, very good player and that pains me to say as a Birmingham City fan.\n\nIbrahim Sangare (Nottingham Forest): Lost him during Afcon and it wasn't the same midfield. He is a pitbull next to Elliot Anderson; he does all of the ugly stuff and breaks it up. A fantastic footballer and part of a solid defensive unit, which obviously Forest needed.\n\nEmiliano Buendia (Aston Villa): Scored unbelievable goals, all vital for their team's attacking outlet. Buendia, for me, just showed that little bit of class and magic. I love to see players taking a risk.\n\nPatrick Dorgu (Manchester United): He's been unbelievable since Michael Carrick came in. That goal in the win at Arsenal was unbelievable and worthy of winning any football match in the world.\n\nEstevao Willian (Chelsea): Young, exciting player and got a goal and assist, but it was against Crystal Palace, so he doesn't get as much chat as the others.\n\nIgor Jesus (Nottingham Forest): In a weekend of strikers not being great, he was solid and Forest had two that ended up scoring. He battles and does all the ugly stuff well, and then he has that little bit of flair for his goal.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo (West Ham): A 3-1 win over Sunderland is huge - it gives West Ham a chance to stay up. If you look at the wins for Forest and now the draw for Leeds, West Ham would have been completely cut adrift. They've now given themselves a chance to get out of it. He gets that because of the biggest win of the weekend.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Former Premier League striker Alan Shearer has blasted Ruben Amorim, branding him “arrogant” after Manchester United’s thrilling victory over Arsenal.\n\nAmorim was sacked earlier this month after 14 months in charge as head coach. He led United to a lowly 15th-place finish last season and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur, but was still backed significantly in the summer and afforded more time to turn things around.\n\nWhile results saw a slight improvement this season, he remained dogmatically committed to his controversial 3-4-2-1 formation. He reverted to a back four on only one occasion, against Newcastle, and United won. Surprisingly, he then retreated to the three-at-the-back system that had put him at loggerheads with the media and supporters.\n\nSkirmishes between Amorim and the football leadership group reached a breaking point after the 1-1 draw with Leeds, leading to Amorim’s dismissal.\n\nMichael Carrick was brought in to replace the Portuguese and so far, the change has worked a treat. Carrick secured a dominant 2-0 win over Manchester City in his first game and followed that up with an incredible 3-2 victory against Arsenal last Sunday.\n\nIn both games against the top two teams in the Premier League, United were by far the better side and were deserving winners. The result vs. Arsenal catapulted Carrick and his players to fourth positions and in a strong position to secure Champions League football.\n\nSpeaking on The Rest is Football podcast, Shearer, Micah Richards, and Gary Lineker credited Carrick for the positive change while simultaneously scrutinising Amorim’s methods.\n\nLineker began, “It’s funny football, isn’t it? Because suddenly you go back to a system that perhaps suits some of the players. You bring back bit of experience in Harry Maguire, you bring back one of the star players in Kobbie Mainoo, and play him in there.”\n\n“You push Bruno [Fernandes] a little bit further forward where he’s a little bit more comfortable and can bring out his brilliance more. You get Amad playing as a winger and not as a wing back. And all of a sudden, it’s very strange, but things start to happen for you.”\n\nRichards added, “We kept saying it continuously, the players were playing out of position. Two number 10s, [Amad] Diallo in a number 10, [Bryan] Mbeumo in the number 10, why? They do the most damage from wide positions. I know Mbeumo is playing up front now, but he’s got the freedom to go where he wants.”\n\n“If you see the goals of Cunha and Dorgu, they are brave goals there, getting on the ball on the half turn and then driving, trying to make something happen.”\n\nJoining the conversation, Shearer questioned, “What on earth is Ruben Amorim sat doing, thinking, looking at those two performances? I mean honestly, I don’t know what he’ll be thinking.”\n\nLineker answered, “He’ll be thinking ‘Maybe I’ve got it wrong?'”\n\nRichards chimed in, “You buy into managers, because of what he did at sporting and it worked very well. Subconsciously you’re thinking, ‘Okay, we’ll give him a little bit more time,’ because it’s worked before. He’s come to a different league. He’s got players who can’t play in those positions, and we’re still waiting, giving him the benefit of doubt.”\n\n“But he got a result, playing 4231, and then he changed back to three at the back. It was madness.”\n\nShearer continued, “Yeah, absolutely crazy. The arrogance to say, ‘No, I’m not doing any other thing. This is my way or the highway.’ I mean, to not even shift or to accept that this is probably not working, ‘Maybe I should try something else.’ He put all his eggs into that basket, and if that didn’t work, he was done. And it didn’t.”\n\nThe trio discussed whether Carrick should be under consideration to be handed the job permanently.\n\nLineker joked that United should immediately offer their former midfielder a contract. Shearer insisted that it’s too early to reach any conclusions and that things will become clearer with time.\n\nCrucially, Lineker warned that tougher challenges await. He noted that while it is easy to be motivated for marquee fixtures against City and Arsenal, the true test of progress will be United’s ability to break down defensive, low-block teams.\n\nUnited are next in action on Sunday when they welcome Fulham to Old Trafford.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche wants the Premier League to ban towels from the sidelines after complaining about the time taken for throw-ins during his side's 2-0 win at Brentford.\n\nDyche believes it is taking too long for teams to get organised for what is essentially now a full-blown set-piece, particularly when throwers opt to dry the ball before hurling it into the box.\n\nBrentford's Michael Kayode was regularly seen reaching for a towel before launching one of his throws towards the Forest area on Sunday.\n\n\"They have towels on the sidelines. I can't work that out,\" Dyche said in his post-match news conference.\n\n\"Nothing against Brentford. It's the rules. How can a home team be allowed to decide if they have towels on the sidelines or not?\"\n\nPremier League guidelines state that towels can only be used provided they are made available to both teams at all times.\n\nDyche's complaint is that, in effect, the away team have no real say in the matter - if the hosts want to use towels they just have to do so equitably.\n\nIt is a different story in the EFL, which banned the use of towels or anything else to dry a ball before the 2023-24 season.\n\nDyche said: \"Why not in the Premier League, just go, no towels, just get on with the game? It just adds in another layer of things for us to talk about and for us to worry about.\n\n\"Just say no towels. Dead easy, isn't it? It's not rocket science. Why make it more complicated? It's unfathomable to me.\"",

    "fullText": "Vincent Kompany is still learning on his job.\n\nThe 39-year-old, now in his second season at Bayern Munich, is still in the early part of his managerial career, which began only in 2020. In that time he’s overseen highs and lows, having both taken Burnley to promotion and suffering relegation from the Premier League.\n\n“I don’t think that winning titles makes you a good coach, or getting relegated makes you a bad one,” Kompany reflected in remarks captured by @iMiaSanMia. “A good coach is someone who learns something new every year, regardless of whether we win or lose.\n\n“We’re in a good position right now; it’s all about the details. We simply want to be competitive. We want to prepare well for the matches where trophies are at stake, where it’s about going through or being eliminated. In those moments, we have to have the big players fit because they’re the ones who decide the games for us.”\n\nWhat else is there to say? You have to love Kompany’s mindset. It is no surprise, given who he is and how he approaches his work, that he has found success at Bayern. Now the club is reflecting these attitudes in just about every way: every day, a little step forward.\n\nAnd this year? The stars seem to be lining up for the Bavarians. It would be a surprise to see them not go far in the Champions League.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

Bruno Fernandes, back in his favourite position as a number 10, was outstanding, and up front Bryan Mbeumo was a goal threat, but also able to hold the ball up, and scared people with his pace and energy.\n\nUnited scored two brilliant goals, but their victory did not rely on outstanding individual performances or moments.\n\nInstead, the whole team played their part in this win, and manager Michael Carrick deserves credit for finding a way of making that happen.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boosted their Premier League survival hopes by returning to winning ways with a disciplined 2–0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.\n\nGoals from Igor Jesus and Taiwo Awoniyi secured three vital away points and restored Forest’s five-point cushion above the relegation zone.\n\nThe result also consigned Brentford to a second consecutive league defeat and ended their seven-match unbeaten home run.\n\nForest arrived under pressure after mixed recent results but produced a composed display that balanced early incision with late control.\n\nThe visitors struck after 12 minutes through Igor Jesus, whose finish set the tone for the evening.\n\nOla Aina’s low cross deflected upwards off Rico Henry, allowing the Brazilian to cushion the ball on his shoulder, spin away from Kristoffer Ajer and drive a powerful shot across goal.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher got a hand to the effort but could not prevent it finding the far corner.\n\nIt was a moment of quality that drained the energy from the home crowd and rewarded Forest’s positive start.\n\nBrentford had threatened early, with Igor Thiago sliding wide inside two minutes after Kevin Schade broke down the left.\n\nThat miss proved costly as the hosts struggled to regain attacking fluency after falling behind.\n\nForest settled into a compact shape, with Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson controlling possession and tempo in midfield.\n\nThe Bees were disrupted further when Ajer and Mikkel Damsgaard were forced off injured before half-time.\n\nA brief spell of pressure followed, but Sepp van den Berg headed narrowly wide from a long throw on the stroke of the interval.\n\nThe second half was attritional, with Brentford enjoying territory but finding little space against a well-organised defence.\n\nMurillo and Nikola Milenkovic dealt calmly with crosses and direct play as Forest remained content to defend deep.\n\nClear chances were scarce, with Igor Thiago firing over from close range during Brentford’s best spell.\n\nAs frustration grew among the hosts, Forest began to sense an opening on the counter-attack.\n\nThat moment arrived with 10 minutes remaining when Gibbs-White released substitute Taiwo Awoniyi down the right.\n\nThe forward outpaced Van den Berg, cut inside and slid a composed finish beneath Kelleher to seal the win.\n\nIt was Awoniyi’s first league goal in a year and a significant milestone following his serious injury late last season.\n\nForest saw out the closing stages comfortably, prioritising shape and discipline as Brentford ran out of ideas.\n\nThe victory extended Forest’s unbeaten league run to three matches and provided a timely lift after midweek European disappointment.",

    "fullText": "This afternoon we welcome Unai Emery and his Aston Villa squad to St. James’ Park. Villa are enjoying an excellent season in the Premier League and in Europe, and Unai’s teams are consistently well organised and full of quality. We know from previous matches what a tough test this will be, but it’s one we relish.\n\nWe approach this match off the back of an excellent night in the UEFA Champions League a few days ago, when we hosted PSV Eindhoven. We knew the importance of the game in the build-up, and we made a really fast start when Yoane Wissa put us ahead after eight minutes, his first European goal for the club.\n\nThis gave the players a platform to push on, and we continued to create a series of chances in a very dominant first half. Our reward came on the half hour when Anthony Gordon doubled our lead, which we took into the break. We also know that 2-0 can be a risky scoreline, and it was important to attack the second half with the same momentum, which we did.\n\nWe felt a third goal would put the game beyond PSV’s reach and Harvey Barnes provided this midway through the second half. We managed the remainder of the game and had opportunities to score even more. When PSV threw everything into finding a way back into the match, we showed the other side of our game and defended really well as a collective unit.\n\nThe players deserve huge credit for how they handled a game which we knew we needed to win as we aim to qualify to the next stage of the competition. Not only the eleven players who started the game, but the five substitutes almost played their part in an excellent team performance against a side who top their domestic league in Holland.\n\nDespite there being big matches in the Champions League and Carabao Cup on the horizon, our sole focus is always on the immediate challenge ahead, and today we return to Premier League action and a really important game as we continue to work hard to climb the table.\n\nThe atmosphere on Wednesday evening was really special and it inspired the players from the moment they walked onto the pitch. That is why we love playing at St James Park so much, and it was great to be able to celebrate the victory with everyone at the full-time whistle.\n\nWe never take this for granted and will need just as much support today, so please stay with us and in return we will give everything to rewarding your incredible loyalty.",

He was an unused substitute in four of those matches.\n\nThe England international was signed from Crystal Palace in August for £67m to add creativity to Arsenal's attack - he shoots freely, while his ability to open a defence in a flash means he adds an element of flair to the forward line that not many others in the squad have.\n\nThat makes the fact that he played just over 10 minutes in each of the recent 0-0 draws with Nottingham Forest and Liverpool, when Arsenal did not allow either of those teams to have a shot on target, even stranger.\n\nIf Eze is not allowed to showcase his ability when Arsenal need a breakthrough, the questions about where he fits into Mikel Arteta's team will keep coming.",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains the thinking behind Michael Carrick's backroom staff appointments at Manchester United, and what a manager wants from those roles.",
    "fullText": "There has been open criticism of Michael Carrick's backroom staff appointments at Manchester United, which is one of the most important issues any manager has to address when joining a new club.\n\nUsing my experience of that situation, I want to try to explain his thinking with the people he has brought in since he was named interim head coach, and how I believe what he has done can only be viewed as sensible. It's certainly a long way removed from the accusation that he has just brought in a bunch of his mates.\n\nMichael's aim at United is the same as every manager when you first arrive in a job. You want to establish quickly a clear and defined alignment between yourself and the different football departments within the organisation that you have just inherited.\n\nYou have to be clear on your objectives and set certain principles in the first few days - like a work ethic, for example - that are non-negotiable and must be made absolutely clear to players and staff members who have not worked with you before.\n\nBuilding a strong base with everyone pulling in the same direction takes time and, initially, it can lead to some forms of confrontation with existing members of the playing and coaching staff.\n\nTo be absolutely clear in communicating your intended direction for the club, I believe the manager has to appoint his own members of staff. I always wanted to bring in people I could trust and who were competent in the responsibilities I would delegate to them.\n\nA manager's job is fraught with pressures and if the most important aspects are not prioritised, the amount of work needed in other areas of the club can become a drain on his ability to perform, on game days or away from those match situations.\n\nThis is where your backroom staff is all-important, and it is the same at every club.\n\nI am sure Michael understands that winning games is the be-all and end-all of what supporters want but, behind the scenes, work has to be performed to generate a togetherness and belief in a way that will produce those winning performances.",

But Howe will likely protect the “pivotal” midfielder by giving Miley the nod alongside Sandro Tonali and Joelinton in midfield.\n\nAn attacking trio of Gordon, Wissa, and Barnes should also remain unchanged after their stellar Champions League display.\n\nWissa’s performance spells trouble for £69 million summer signing Nick Woltemade, who is on an eight-match goal drought since bagging a brace against Chelsea in December 2025.",

Tom Bramall will be the fourth official.\n\nPaul Tierney will be on VAR, with Dan Robathan completing the officiating team as the assistant VAR.\n\nPawson had an eight-month stretch without refereeing Arsenal games after he dismissed Myles Lewis-Skelly against West Ham United in February.\n\nThough Lewis-Skelly did bring down Mohammed Kudus and arguably denied a goalscoring opportunity, the foul on the halfway line was far from a “clear” opportunity, and Kudus elbowed Lewis-Skelly in the head before the foul.\n\nIn Pawson’s defence, he initially showed a yellow card, only for VAR to recommend an upgrade. But both Pawson and the VAR official missed Kudus’ initial offence whilst conducting their reviews.\n\nPawson then returned to refereeing Arsenal in November, taking the Gunners’ away draw to Sunderland.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side are now on a three-game run without a win under Pawson, but they do have a positive record overall, with 18 wins, five draws, and 11 defeats with the official.\n\nThe last time he refereed this particular fixture of Arsenal vs Manchester United, the Gunners won 3-1.",

    "fullText": "Making your Premier League debut at Manchester City would be a daunting prospect for anyone - even as a referee.\n\nBut 32-year-old Farai Hallam, once a professional footballer on Stevenage's books, earned widespread praise for his performance during City's 2-0 win over Wolves at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.\n\nWith the hosts leading 1-0 in the first half, goalscorer Omar Marmoush was convinced the hosts should be awarded a penalty after Wanderers defender Yerson Mosquera appeared to handle the ball inside the area.\n\nHallam was unmoved, waving appeals away, only to then be sent to the pitchside monitor by the video assistant referee (VAR) to check the incident.\n\nWe all know what that normally means. The City fans were already celebrating.\n\nAfter watching several replays, however, Hallam surprised nearly everyone inside the stadium by choosing to stick with his original decision.\n\n\"After review, the ball hits the arm of the Wolves player, which is in a natural position so the on-field decision will remain,\" he announced over the tannoy.\n\nFormer Premier League assistant referee Darren Cann said it was \"without doubt the correct decision\".\n\n\"Hallam, officiating in his first Premier League match, made an excellent and courageous call to stick with his on-field decision of no handball,\" Cann told BBC Sport.\n\n\"This was without doubt the correct decision as Yerson Mosquera's arm was in a justifiable position and the ball was played on to his arm from very close range.\n\n\"A brave and correct decision in law from a highly regarded referee making his Premier League debut.\"",

    "description": "There are claims from some people that the Premier League is dull this year, but the 0-0 draw can be a fascinating beast",
    "fullText": "The 0-0 draw between Wolves and Newcastle was the second goalless game of the weekend, and the 17th of the season. This is already more than last season, and six more than in the whole of the 2023-24 season.\n\nStalemates are often dull and are usually examples of strikers having off days or goalkeepers having a blinder. This is true for most of them, but the context of these games is so important. \n\nSunderland have been involved in three 0-0 draws so far this season, away at Crystal Palace and Brighton, and then at home to Man City. From our perspective, all three have been rewarding and were achieved thanks to back-to-the-wall defending and plenty of grit.\n\nThe Palace game was only the fourth game of the season, but looking back, it was the first that showed how solid we wanted to be. The FA Cup holders hammered Villa 3-0 in the previous game, but we were fantastic at the back to pick up a brilliant point on the road. \n\nDogged defending is a thing of beauty, and one that is overlooked far too often. There is an art in defending, and this season, having conceded 23 in 22 games, we’ve shown ourselves to be masters of this particular art. \n\nEvery point in the Premier League should be celebrated, and maybe that’s why a battling 0-0 draw feels so good. The Man City game was a perfect example of good old fashioned, honest, gutsy defending with players celebrating blocks and tackles.\n\nThis tough attitude should be commended, and there’s nothing wrong with grinding out results here and there. Promoted teams need to come up and be hard to beat, and five losses in 22 games prove we’ve done just that. \n\nThere may have been some boring 0-0 draws in the Premier League this season, but I wouldn’t class ours in any of these. Maybe that’s a Sunderland bias shining through, but at full-time against Man City, I felt as though I’d watched a proper game of football where both sides had chances, but both defences prevailed over the forwards, and it was a back-and-forth kind of game in this sense. \n\nThere has been talk that the Premier League this season is weaker and more boring than in recent years, which seems odd considering that, for the first time in a long time, more than one promoted team has come up and competed. Last season saw three crap teams get promoted and go straight back down with not much of a whimper. It’s almost as if the established sides don’t like it when promoted teams show some fight, which is what we and Leeds are doing in spadefuls. \n\nWe’ll probably have at least one more 0-0 draw this season, and when that comes, it will likely be just as gutsy and fulfilling as the three we have in the bag. I’m still full of pride for Sunderland thriving back in the Premier League and each block, tackle, and header is a step closer towards sealing our status in the top flight next season.",

    "description": "There are no salary caps, no aprons, and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced",
    "fullText": "There are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced\n\nDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.\n\nCurrent commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver said then in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n\n“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”\n\nFor decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.\n\nYet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won the Premier League just about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.\n\nConcerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double as handy instruments to write off taxes for billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.\n\nLately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.\n\nThey can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.\n\nThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rules now tweaked to merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.\n\nMore tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)\n\nCertainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.\n\nThat’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

It is in cinemas from Friday.\n\nNaturally, we asked AI who would play Sutton if a film were ever made about him.\n\nThe best fit, apparently, is Hollywood heartthrob Tom Hardy - who is four inches shorter than BBC Sport football expert Sutton but is AI's top choice for the role because he is \"known for portraying tough, brooding characters with emotional depth\".\n\n\"That just shows how way off the mark AI is,\" said Sutton.\n\n\"But I'm happy with Tom Hardy, even though he is not tall enough. Most people would probably say I am more like Laurel and Hardy though.\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHardwicke, who supports Aston Villa, is his guest for week 23.\n\nDo you agree with their scores?

    "fullText": "Liverpool took the decision to send Harvey Elliott on loan to Aston Villa on transfer deadline day.\n\nThe 22-year-old - now a double Premier League title winner - was permitted to join Unai Emery’s side on a one-season loan deal ahead of a potential permanent move.\n\nThe terms of the deal dictated that Elliott’s loan would become permanent once he played 10 first-team games for the Villans. But it looked as though his fate was sealed early - with no appearances in any competition since October and stuck on five games overall.\n\nLiverpool have been linked with a move to bring Elliott back from his nightmare loan spell with Villa having little inclination to activate the £35m clause.\n\nHowever the England under-21 international would be severely limited in his options for the second half of the season if he did come back.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThe Anfield club would be unable to send the playmaker on loan to another European club - as Elliott has already featured for two clubs in the 2025/26 season.\n\nTherefore the midfielder is stuck in a limbo - unable to be fixed up with a new deal and with no chance of first-team football at Villa or Liverpool for that matter.\n\nBut Elliott could be set for an UNEXPECTED Aston Villa reprieve.\n\nFollowing John McGinn’s knee injury against Everton at the weekend Villa are very much down to the bare bones in midfield.\n\nThe Scotland international joins Amadou Onana, Ross Barkley and Boubacar Kamara on the treatment table at Villa Park.\n\nEmery is quickly running out of options in midfield - utilising Dutch defender Lamare Bogarde in the engine room against the Toffees.\n\nWith McGinn sidelined he opted to bring in Evann Guessand and shuffle his deck but he has got nowhere to turn for the upcoming weeks unless he offers the olive branch to Elliott.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what he does over the on-loan Liverpool star for the games against Fenerbahce on Thursday as well as Newcastle at the weekend.\n\nNo one is saying Elliott is going to reach the 10-game threshold in order to facilitate a permanent deal.",

    "fullText": "Everton are still trying to bring in a new striker this month, but it looks like one of their targets has come up on Sean Dyche’s radar too.\n\nThey have not made any signings so far this month.\n\nEven though a forward is needed, the Toffees are not expected to spend much. Loans seem more realistic at this stage.\n\nStill, they are keeping their options open and checking out what might be possible.\n\nThis week, reports came out that Everton had asked about Sunderland’s Wilson Isidor. He has not been getting much playing time and could be available.\n\nBut if Everton do decide to make a move, they will not be the only club interested in him.\n\nAccording to Sky Sports’ Keith Downie, interest in Isidor has been picking up as the transfer window nears its close.\n\nHe mentioned that Everton are interested, and so are Nottingham Forest under Sean Dyche.\n\nDownie posted on X: “Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired on Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor. No concrete approach has been made, as both clubs are waiting and/or considering other targets.\n\n“The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and is one to watch this window.\n\n“25-year-old Isidor’s contract is up in 2028 but he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland.\n\n“Isidor has scored 4 Premier League goals this season, but hasn’t netted since October.”\n\nIt remains to be seen if either club will decide to make a formal offer for Isidor.\n\nEarlier this week, there were reports suggesting that Everton were not actively moving forward with a pursuit of Isidor, which could give Dyche and Forest an opening.\n\nDyche has a clear need for more firepower this month. Only Wolves have scored fewer goals than Forest this season, and adding another option up front could be crucial in the battle against relegation.\n\nForest are just five points above the drop zone at the moment, making every decision in the transfer window even more important.",

    "description": "Former Premier League striker Thierry Henry has urged Manchester United to sort out one key thing before they seal the appointment of a new permanent boss.United on hunt for new managerTwo weeks ago, ...",
    "fullText": "Former Premier League striker Thierry Henry has urged Manchester United to sort out one key thing before they seal the appointment of a new permanent boss.\n\nTwo weeks ago, United confirmed the sacking of Ruben Amorim after 14 months in charge as head coach.\n\nAmorim’s spell was littered with instability as he struggled to implement his controversial 3-4-2-1 system. His departure was ultimately triggered by conflicts with certain players and decisively, with the club leadership, particularly director of football Jason Wilcox.\n\nMichael Carrick was brought in to serve as caretaker boss until the end of the season.\n\nThe United legend enjoyed a dream start to life, leading the club to a dominant 2-0 victory over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. The result catapulted the Red Devils to fifth place in the top-flight standings and firmly in the frame for a top-four finish with 16 games left to play.\n\nUnited are expected to make a permanent appointment in the summer, having considered all their options.\n\nSome of the coaches who have been linked to the Old Trafford hot seat are Roberto De Zerbi, Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola, Luis Enrique, Julian Nagelsmann and Thomas Tuchel.\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports, Henry strongly urged United to first determine what direction they want to go before picking the new boss.  Since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, United have experimented with managers of varying tactical styles, personalities, and temperaments, yet none have succeeded in restoring the club to its former glory.\n\nHenry said [as quoted by the Daily Mail], “The reality is what do they want Man United to be. What do they want, I don’t feel it from the outside. I don’t feel whatever they are looking at.”\n\n“Bayern went to get Vincent Kompany, we talked about Luis Enrique, we talked about Frank Rijkaard (at Barcelona).”\n\n“You can agree of disagree, you can see what type of coaches they want. I don’t know at Man United, I really don’t know what they are about now, what they want to achieve and what is the DNA. I am talking about now when I watch the games. What Michael Carrick did at the weekend was brilliant, but in two weeks we could be talking about something else.”\n\nHenry added, “What do they want, how are they going to go about it? It should be clear in order to get one of the guys we are talking about.”\n\n“The way they [Barcelona] see it on the other side, if you don’t fit who the house is, it doesn’t matter who you are or what you have done before.”\n\n“If you fit what we believe in, you can come. But what are you to make that decision.”\n\nOn whether Carrick should be considered for the position, Henry asserted that if he performs well, he should be considered for the position.\n\nfeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Premier League referees' boss Howard Webb has rejected claims that his officials made a mistake by not sending off Diogo Dalot in Saturday's Manchester derby.\n\nDalot was booked in the 11th minute of Manchester United's 2-0 win over Manchester City for a high challenge on Jeremy Doku.\n\nThe Portugal international had closed down Doku and stretched out a leg to try to intercept the ball. He made contact with his studs on the knee of the winger.\n\nThe video assistant referee (VAR), Craig Pawson, supported Anthony Taylor's on-field decision of a yellow card saying the contact was \"glancing and not with excessive force\".\n\nProfessional Game Match Officials boss Webb insists too much has been made of the slow-motion replays and a yellow card was an acceptable outcome.\n\n\"The officials on the field saw the actions of Dalot, they saw him stretch forward with his foot, he touches the ball, and then there's contact on Jeremy Doku,\" Webb said on Match Officials Mic'd Up.\n\n\"They deemed that to be a reckless action and therefore worthy of a yellow card.\n\n\"I know other people think it's clearly red. I don't agree - I think there's a mix of considerations.\n\n\"I know that when we look at this, we see that the point of contact is on the knee, but we also have to factor in speed, force and intensity.\n\n\"You'll not see many red cards in the Premier League for serious foul play that don't involve those things.\n\n\"Now, we evaluate those things through a full-speed view of the incident. Without looking at it at full speed, you get kind of a distorted view. You don't get a true picture of how much force and speed there was in the challenge.\n\n\"That foot touches the knee, comes off pretty quickly. We can see on slow-mo that it does touch that knee.\n\n\"But at full speed, when you play it in real time, you can see there's not a great deal of speed in the action. Not a lot of intensity.\n\n\"We were heavily criticised a few years ago for using slow motion and freeze frames, because people said this is not reality, it's not how the game is played.\n\n\"When you slow it down it can look a lot worse - and it does. When you freeze frame it, you can make a lot of situations look like red-card offences.\n\n\"So, it's difficult for me to hear people make a judgment on this just by analysing freeze frames and slow motion, coming to the consideration that it's red on that basis.\"",

    "fullText": "Not too long ago, Manchester United fans were fearing the worst when it came to Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nWith Ruben Amorim not handing him a single start in the Premier League, it looked certain that the Carrington wonderkid would be jumping ship in January.\n\nINEOS had blocked his loan demand in the summer, but the 20-year-old was now contemplating a permanent transfer away from his boyhood club.\n\nAll that has changed in the past 10 days. The Portuguese tactician got himself sacked, and with Michael Carrick now at the helm, the Englishman’s fortunes have shifted as well.\n\nHe earned his first league start of the campaign in the Manchester derby, and he put on a show against Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nThe caretaker head coach has managed to fire up the Carrington graduate, who is in a far better place mentally as compared to a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe midfield wonderkid is excited again, and is looking forward to earning more minutes under the legendary midfielder, who is more inclined towards handing opportunities to academy products.\n\nAnd as revealed by Teamtalk, the England international is not looking to jump ship any longer and as a result, exit talks with potential suitors like Napoli and Chelsea have been paused.\n\n“Kobbie Mainoo’s immediate future looks to be at Manchester United, with sources indicating the young midfielder is content to stay at Old Trafford provided he continues to receive regular playing time under interim manager Michael Carrick.\n\n“One of Carrick’s early priorities was to personally assure Mainoo of his importance to the team’s plans. Sources close to the situation reveal that the former United midfielder made it clear he views the England international as a central figure in his vision for the club.\n\n“Sources say Mainoo is excited by the fresh opportunities now available to him. Having been starved of consistent starts previously, the chance to play regularly under Carrick has changed his outlook.\n\n“Exit discussions that had gained traction earlier in the month have been paused by sources, with Carrick’s assurances proving pivotal in convincing the youngster to stay and fight for his place.”\n\nKobbie Mainoo cannot afford to relax. He must keep up the same level of performance against Arsenal next weekend as the Red Devils look to climb up the table.\n\nFeature image Jan Kruger via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nRobert Sanchez (Chelsea): Coming off the back of a terrible week with his errors against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup, you have to say he answered the questions the right way. Delivered against Brentford, made some big saves, kept Chelsea in the game and kept a clean sheet, which helps along the way.\n\nAlex Jimenez (Bournemouth): He came off in the 90th minute of Monday's 1-1 draw at Brighton, cramped up, but a wonderful performer. Defended excellently, and the way he went forward was fantastic as well. Unfortunately, he couldn't keep a clean sheet right at the end, but he actually wasn't on the pitch for that situation, so he gets a pass for that.\n\nHarry Maguire (Manchester United): Manchester United were excellent as they beat neighbours City on Saturday. I could've put the whole of the United team in this week, to be totally honest. However, having Harry Maguire back from his hamstring injury is huge for Michael Carrick. He was probably United's best player during Ruben Amorim's time in charge as well.\n\nJames Tarkowski (Everton): Wonderful performance in Sunday's win at Aston Villa. He gets in both for his attacking threat and also because defensively, he was a monster. I think he's one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. He's fantastic with the way he approaches the game and what he delivers.\n\nLewis Hall (Newcastle United): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile during Newcastle's 0-0 draw at Wolves on Sunday, and he's starting to make the case that he should be starting for England. That's how good he's been this season.\n\nCrysencio Summerville (West Ham): He gets a goal - but it is more about the magnitude of the moment, and being able to get West Ham off to a flying start against Tottenham. With Saturday's 2-1 win, there is a little bit of hope now that they can get out of this mess that they find themselves in.\n\nEthan Ampadu (Leeds United): Every time Ampadu plays well, Leeds play well. Whenever they win, he is at the heart of everything. He got an assist as they beat Fulham on Saturday but the tackles and covering runs were more important. A top performance.\n\nEnzo Le Fee (Sunderland): He is excellent. He has quality and he oozes class. He gives me the same feeling as when Carlos Tevez went to West Ham - you could see he was too good for that level. He picked up some brilliant positions against Crystal Palace, and also scored a wonderful goal in Sunderland's 2-1 win.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): He would have been a scorer in the Manchester derby if he had managed to stay onside, but he was the heart of the United performance. How many times are we going to say that? United are only as good as he drives them to be.\n\nPatrick Dorgu (Manchester United): He seems a freer player since being moved up the pitch. There have been a lot of conversations about systems at United, but with Dorgu, one thing is clear - as a high left-sided player, he seems to have added a lot to his game. More goals helps as well.\n\nBryan Mbeumo (Manchester United): Playing out of position in Saturday's derby, he ran his socks off, and delivered with a goal - a wonderful finish. He carried the team over the line. Hopefully now he can start to find the net more consistently for Manchester United.\n\nMichael Carrick (Manchester United): A tough week for him. A lot of people, including Roy Keane and myself, were questioning whether he's good enough and things of that nature - or whether he even deserves the role. He answered emphatically. A wonderful, wonderful result. I think you have to say that's easily the manager's performance of the week. Now, can he back it up against Arsenal next week?\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "One player who was conspicuous by his absence when Michael Carrick named his first Manchester United squad was Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nThe Dutchman has started only four Premier League games all season, as former head coach Ruben Amorim was clearly not a fan.\n\nWith his minutes drastically reduced, the Netherlands international was keen to jump ship in January, with AS Roma pushing hard for his signature.\n\nThey had proposed an initial loan with a conditional obligation and had even submitted their contract with the 24-year-old’s representatives.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\nHowever, Amorim’s sack meant an exit was blocked and it was decided that the former Bologna ace would not be allowed to leave in winter.\n\nThe Giallorossi finally admitted defeat, but with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo back, and Benjamin Sesko’s red-hot form, the former Bayern Munich star is unlikely to start too many games.\n\nWhich is why Juventus have identified him as their Plan B in case they fail to persuade Crystal Palace to part with Jean-Philippe Mateta as per Teamtalk.\n\n“Juventus have an eye on Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee in case they fail in their bid to sign Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, sources confirm.\n\n“There is a belief that he will still do well back in Serie A, where he had a good spell with Bologna.\n\n“Roma tried to sign him this month but ran into difficulties after Ruben Amorim departed – so even a deal for the United man would not be easy, even though he is keen on a new challenge.”\n\nDespite Joshua Zirkzee being open to the possibility, it will be a difficult deal to crack unless INEOS bring in another forward.\n\nWith Champions League qualification the goal, the co-owners cannot afford to leave Carrick short in the second-half of the campaign.\n\nThe versatile forward is currently injured, and it will be interesting to see if he makes the matchday squad for the game against Arsenal. Should his chances continue to be limited, he might yet push for an exit later in the window.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

Ifab believes this shows zero tolerance to concussion.\n\nA player who is believed to have experienced a concussion must be substituted and cannot go back on to the pitch.\n\nBut the Premier League argues permanent substitutions create a greater chance a team will risk leaving a player on the field.\n\nWith the temporary substitutes a player would be removed from the field for 10-15 minutes for a full medical assessment.

    "fullText": "Arsenal may have left Nottingham Forest on Saturday night regretting a missed opportunity. The reality is they will actually never have a better chance of ending a Premier League title drought stretching back to 'The Invincibles' of 2004.\n\nMikel Arteta's side have emerged from the weekend with an advantage stretched to seven points as the chasing pack aiming to put them under pressure stumbled badly.\n\nArsenal and Arteta will rightly urge caution, but the Gunners will never forgive themselves if they do not claim the crown that has proved so elusive, faced with the domination of Manchester City and the successes of Liverpool.\n\nWhen every circumstance is examined, this feels like the 'now or never' season for Arteta's Arsenal.\n\nIf they fail to win the title this season from such a position, the regrets will run deep. Everything is in place for a triumphant surge towards the finishing tape.\n\nBack-to-back goalless draws has left some questioning Arsenal's firepower but, with the tightest defence in the league and their rivals continually slipping up, it would take a brave person to back against them now.\n\nBigger leads have been lost at the top of the Premier League before - and later in the season - but none of the teams below them are showing signs of producing the consistency needed to challenge them.\n\nManchester City failed to turn up the pressure valve before Arsenal travelled to the City Ground by losing the derby at Manchester United - a fourth straight match without a win.\n\nAnd then, here at Villa Park, Aston Villa saw their hopes of leap-frogging Pep Guardiola's side into second place undone as excellent Everton secured a fully deserved win.\n\nAs for reigning champions Liverpool, they have mounted a miserable defence of their crown, Saturday's disappointing draw against Burnley at Anfield that provoked jeers from their fans leaving them fourth, a distant 14 points behind Arsenal.\n\nVilla had won their previous 11 games at home, but Everton threatened the decisive moments long before Thierno Barry cashed in on keeper Emi Martinez's decision to turn a routine stop into an item for his showreel with a classy finish.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool fans will no doubt be feeling a little frustrated.\n\nMarc Guehi was in the Premier League champions’ grasp just a few short months ago but now looks set to move to Manchester City.\n\nSporting director Richard Hughes agreed a fee for the Crystal Palace captain back on transfer deadline day. The Reds would pay an initial £35m for Guehi - whose contract at the FA Cup holders was due to expire in summer 2026.\n\nBut owing to a failure to land a replacement Palace pulled the plug with the 25-year-old defender instead staying put.\n\nMan City’s needs for a top-quality centre-back have increased in recent weeks - considering the injuries suffered by Ruben Dias, John Stones and above all Josko Gvardiol.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThat meant Pep Guardiola brought forward a deal for Guehi - who was set to become a high-profile free agent next summer. The England defender will now join City on a bumper contract for a fee of around £20m - leaving Liverpool empty-handed.\n\nPlans will now need to be made for an alternative defender to come to Anfield - and it’s unlikely to happen in January. But next summer the picture will change and the Merseysiders will need to recruit a solid, senior option in the position.\n\nAnd according to a report in TEAMtalk one Liverpool target Alessandro Bastoni is willing to move.\n\nThe Inter Milan defender, 26, is under contract at San Siro until 2028 and it’s speculated that a fee of around £70m would be required to sign the Italy international.\n\n“Alessandro Bastoni is very much open to a transfer this year,” the report reads.\n\nIt looks like Chelsea will also be in the market for Bastoni - a left-footed centre-back who can also play in a back three. Other players reported to be under consideration for a Liverpool role include Nico Schlotterbeck and Nathan Collins.\n\nBastoni has won two Serie A titles for the Nerazzurri since debuting in the 2019/20 season and has also helped his side reach two Champions League final. He was also a member of the Italy squad which won the 2020 UEFA European Championship at Wembley.",

I could say that and blame [the decision], but we will not grow up and move forward.\n\n\"It happened and it is not a surprise, it happened in the past when I arrived here. Honestly, we have to look at ourselves. If the players have excuses, we will be in trouble in the future.\n\n\"We have to look at ourselves and today the analysis is simple - Manchester United were better and we have to accept it.\"\n\nFormer Premier League official Darren Cann told BBC Sport he thought Dalot was \"very fortunate to escape a red card\".\n\n\"It's a hard one to see at normal speed live on the pitch from the referee's angle but with the benefit of replays I do feel that Dalot is very fortunate not receive a red card,\" he added.\n\n\"Had the referee been invited to the screen I am sure he would have been shown a red card.\"\n\nInterim United boss Carrick said: \"I am not giving you that [Guardiola's] answer, I have not seen it but I thought at the time Diogo got the ball and kicked it out. I did not think for one second it was a bad challenge. I got told later it was a lack of force [that meant he was not shown red].\"\n\nFollowing this loss and draws against Sunderland, Chelsea and Brighton, City are now winless in their last four league games and have handed a major advantage to Mikel Arteta's Arsenal.\n\nCity are close to completing the £20m signing of Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi to bolster the defence but the arduous schedule now appears to be catching up with City's front players.\n\nStriker Erling Haaland is in a barren run of form, scoring just once - from the penalty spot - in his last seven games and without a goal from open play since 20 December.\n\nThe Norwegian was out-battled by United defender Lisandro Martinez on Saturday, managing just 14 touches of the ball in the entire game and failing to manage a shot on target.\n\nPhil Foden has gone eight straight games without scoring while substitute Rayan Cherki, who scored late on at Newcastle during the week, was unable to influence the game.\n\nCity's expected goal (xG) rate of 0.45 in the contest was the second lowest recorded in Guardiola's 364 games in charge in the Premier League.\n\nThe 54-year-old, who celebrates his birthday on Sunday, told BBC Match of the Day: \"We were not good enough up front. We could not do it. I had a feeling we didn't have and they had it and they deserve it.\n\n\"Normally in the beginning of the game when they come to Etihad Stadium our rhythm is another one and it's normal doing that.\n\n\"Offensively we did not have the intention in the final third to score a goal, to make a cross, to make a movement. We were more predictable.\"\n\nCity will aim to get their season back on track with a trip to Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\nDespite boasting 68% of the possession, City were limited to one shot on target and the second lowest xG of Guardiola’s Premier League career.\n\nUnited looked to funnel City into wide areas before defending intensely with four players. On the left, for example, Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu, Kobbie Mainoo and Luke Shaw converged to reduce the time and space City had.\n\nThe number of players committed to the side the ball was on meant the space was on the far side, but City struggled to switch the point of attack, something Antoine Semenyo, Jeremy Doku and Rico Lewis do less of than some of their team-mates.\n\nPhil Foden on the right wing or Matheus Nunes have shown this ability in the past and the latter was a particular miss.\n\nCity lacked Nunes’ physical profile to help deal with United’s threat on transition by tracking the runs of Patrick Dorgu and aiding Rodri, who found himself having to deal with both Mbeumo and Bruno at times.\n\nWhen penned back, United defended in a way that gave time and space to the City centre-backs more than anybody else.\n\nBut, despite stopping numerous counter-attacks, when he had possession Abdukodir Khusanov struggled to take advantage of the spaces United left, as did Nathan Ake and Max Alleyne.\n\nTheir lack of ball-playing quality meant City struggled in a way they may not have done if they'd had the injured Josko Gvardiol, John Stones and Ruben Dias on the pitch.",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid will be busy over the coming weeks, as they seek to add to Diego Simeone’s squad during the winter transfer window. They need replacements for Conor Gallagher, who has joined Tottenham Hotspur in a deal worth €40m, and Giacomo Raspadori, who is about to leave for Atalanta, and targets have already been identified.\n\nGallagher’s departure has left Atleti with Pablo Barrios, Koke Resurreccion, Johnny Cardoso and Marcos Llorente as central midfield options, but with the latter preferred as a right-back, it is clear that a new addition is needed. The money will be there for director of football Mateu Alemany to spend, and some of it could be spent on Joao Gomes.\n\nAs per Marca, Atleti are interested in Gomes, who is also wanted by Manchester United and Napoli. The 24-year-old, who has featured 10 times for Brazil, is expected to leave Wolves in 2026, given that relegation from the Premier League is seen as an absolutely certainty to happen.\n\nA sale this month would allow Wolves to bring in a bigger transfer fee for Gomes, especially given the strong interest being shown in his services. This wouldn’t be overly ideal for Atleti, who would prefer not to get into a bidding war for one of their leading targets.\n\nThe impending departure of Raspadori means that Atleti will need a new attacker, but midfield is the absolute priority right now. The plan is for a deal to be done as soon as possible, which is why numerous targets are being looked at – with one of them being Gomes.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who Atleti end up going for. They have many options at their disposal, but finding the right one to compete with Barrios, Koke and Cardoso will be crucial.",

Now his Liverpool future just suffered a massive blow that he must battle against.\n\nArne Slot delivered the Premier League title in his first season as Liverpool boss. Few, then, could have imagined that he'd be facing the sack in his second.\n\nBut that's been the reality. We don't believe he's been on the brink of losing his job, admittedly, but the pressure has skyrocketed after Liverpool's worst run of form for 70 years.\n\nWe've seen some of the absolute worst results of any modern Liverpool team, including a 3-0 home defeat to Nottingham Forest followed by a 4-1 home defeat against PSV Eindhoven.\n\nIt's been awful at times. And the reality is that Liverpool haven't had consistently good form since the start of 2025. While a lot of last season's struggles were ignored because of the title procession, they've been impossible to ignore this season.\n\nThere's always been one obvious reason why Liverpool wouldn't sack Slot, though. However, that reason has now disappeared.\n\nIf Liverpool sacked Slot, who would come in? That's the question that always made moving on from the Dutchman improbable.\n\nAfter all, Slot was Liverpool's pick back in early 2024 and the group of available coaches hasn't exactly moved on dramatically. There haven't been any obvious hires.\n\nContrast that to when Brendan Rodgers was let go in 2015 - both Jurgen Klopp and Carlo Ancelotti were available and willing to talk.\n\nBut things changed on Monday. Real Madrid have sacked Xabi Alonso - even if they're calling it 'mutual termination' - and the former Liverpool midfielder is free to join a new club.",

But as time has passed, it’s become clear that he prefers to play as a number ten.\n\nThat’s all well and good. The problem is that Chelsea already have plenty of number tens. There’s an argument they have too many, even without the Brazil star. Meanwhile, they’re pretty short up front.\n\nLiam Delap has missed most of the season injured, and has only just scored his first Premier League goal a week ago. Yet as far as we can see, he’s ahead of JP in the pecking order for Liam Rosenior. Delap may not score, but he puts himself about. That’s more than you can say for Joao Pedro at the moment.\n\nJoao Pedro protests a decision against Arsenal. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWith Enzo Fernandez, Andrey Santos, Cole Palmer and even Estevao Willian pushing for minutes at 10, and Delap a better option up top, JP is looking a little lost right now. Rotation and injuries will always mean he’s in line for fairly regular action, especially off the bench where he provides a good option.\n\nBut right now, it’s hard to imagine him being considered first choice. He’s got 18 Premier League starts and 3 sub appearances, so he’s featured in every game so far this season. We doubt that record is going to continue.\n\nWest Ham are circling around the drain of the Premier League, and are getting desperate for solutions. They’re now sniffing around a player who Chelsea don’t even use.\n\nCole Palmer had his annus mirabilis under Mauricio Pochettino rather than Enzo Maresca and the stats show it clearly – but how much of that was actually down to the coaches?",

    "fullText": "Northern Ireland's Josh Rock says he expects there to be a raucous atmosphere when he faces double world champion Luke Littler in the Premier League at the SSE Arena in Belfast in February.\n\nRock was named in the elite group of eight players to contest the Premier League for the first time last week, with the 17-week tournament kicking off in Newcastle on 5 February.\n\nBelfast will host night four on 26 February, with the county Antrim native set to enjoy the support of the partisan home fans as he takes on world number one Littler.\n\n\"I think it's going to be absolutely nuts,\" the 24-year-old told BBC Sport NI.\n\n\"Daryl [Gurney] was the last one [from Northern Ireland to be part of the Premier League, in 2020], but that was prior to Covid and darts wasn't as big back then. Now darts is bigger than it has ever been.\n\n\"I play Luke [Littler] in Belfast so we'll see what happens. Every time I have played him it's been 100 plus averages every time. I've been in front every time but just can't seem to get over the line, but I'll get him yet.\"\n\nRock says he chats with Littler \"nearly every day\" and that the sport owes much to the English teenage sensation.\n\n\"Everything has to go down to Luke Littler. If it wasn't for him doing what he did when he was only 16 [reaching the World Championship final as a rank outsider] and winning the Worlds the past two years the sport wouldn't be where it is now.\n\n\"Everyone has to thank him for it.\n\n\"It has gone through the roof now. Darts is in a different place now than it was 10 years ago when I was a youth player. There are so many opportunities now.\"",
