    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest have asked for the VAR audio as they consider making a formal complaint following the defeat by Manchester City.\n\nThe club are extremely unhappy with referee Rob Jones' decisions during Saturday's 2-1 loss at the City Ground.\n\nForest have gone to the referees' body - the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) - to ask to hear the conversations between on-pitch officials and the video assistant referee team during key moments of the match.\n\nHead coach Sean Dyche felt Rayan Cherki's 83rd-minute winner should have been ruled out for a foul on Morgan Gibbs-White, and that Jones should have shown City defender Ruben Dias a second yellow card after the break.\n\n\"Such an easy game to referee, in my opinion, such an easy decision for VAR,\" Dyche said on Saturday.\n\n\"When you played so well, to come in and have to talk about officials affecting the game - but they clearly did.\n\n\"Everyone in the stadium and everyone watching at home could see that.\"\n\nForest players complained to referee Jones, arguing Gibbs-White had been pushed by Nico O'Reilly while defending a corner and therefore stopped from blocking Cherki's winner.\n\n\"Morgan Gibbs-White quite clearly gets pushed to the floor and the same player is involved in blocking the ball,\" Dyche said.\n\n\"But he can't block it because as he jumps up, it goes through the bit of his body which he would have blocked it with. Whichever way you look at it, it's a foul.\"\n\nThe VAR checked the goal but allowed Jones' on-field decision to stand. Defeat left Forest five points above the Premier League's relegation zone.\n\nThe PGMOL has previously played audio privately to clubs - including Forest - while PGMOL chief refereeing officer Howard Webb also discusses incidents on the Mic'd Up programme.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are planning a midfield revamp come next summer, and they have identified three top-class Premier League midfielders to replace their ageing stars.\n\nCasemiro, despite his resurgence, no longer has the legs to complete 90 minutes in the English top-flight every gameweek.\n\nAnd despite his impressive showing against Newcastle, Manuel Ugarte remains a disappointing signing, with INEOS looking to move him on at the earliest opportunity.\n\nSkipper Bruno Fernandes remains the club’s best player, but the co-owners might look to sell him like last summer. Kobbie Mainoo has failed to impress the head coach.\n\nWhether all three depart or not remains to be seen, but the Red Devils have identified the likes of Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton, and Elliot Anderson as potential replacements.\n\nThe Crystal Palace star’s game-reading skills and ability to dictate play from deep reminds many of United legend Michael Carrick, and he would be a huge asset to have.\n\nHowever, his impressive form has seen many teams enter the race, including Spanish giants Real Madrid.\n\nPalace have made it clear that they are open to a sale should they receive a significant offer.\n\nAnd now, Teamtalk have revealed that Tottenham Hotspur are prepared to break the bank to land the England international.\n\n“Tottenham Hotspur are interested in stepping up their pursuit of Adam Wharton in 2026, with sources indicating the club would be prepared to make a very significant offer for the midfielder.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“Spurs initially explored a move for Wharton in the previous transfer window, but Crystal Palace made it clear they were completely unwilling to entertain any approaches at a time when Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid were also monitoring him.\n\n“Since then, competition for Wharton has only intensified, and Tottenham know they will need to act quickly and decisively if they are to win the race for his signature.”\n\nThe 21-year-old has indicated that he will only move to a club which can offer him Champions League football.\n\nThat means Spurs, who are currently 11th, might struggle to offer him the same unless their on-pitch performances improve drastically.\n\nOn the other hand, Amorim’s men are sixth, only three points away from fourth place. A push in the second half of the season could propel the Old Trafford side back to Europe’s top-tier club competition. Thereby, increasing their chances of landing Adam Wharton.\n\nFeature image Eddie Keogh via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nSenne Lammens (Manchester United): I was going to put David Raya in but I thought one good save doesn't get you in the Team of the Week - the bar is higher than that. He made four or five good saves against Newcastle, conducted his box well and has given Manchester United a platform and base to build off - which they've never had. All that for £18m, not bad at all.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): I obviously worked the game between Arsenal and Brighton at the weekend and Declan Rice filled in at right-back. He was still massively influential, marauding forward and defensively he was solid. He never had anyone at Brighton get at him. He just handled every situation well.\n\nArchie Gray (Tottenham): This one is a little bit dodgy, but I'm putting him in the team anyway. I'm aware he played in midfield against Crystal Palace but the reason I'm putting him there is because I felt like he needed to get in the team. Simply put: he got the winner and he's done every single thing that Spurs have asked of him - played left-back, played right-back, played right wing. You name it, he's done it all. I think he goes in for that situation\n\nKevin Danso (Tottenham): He was going to Wolves at one point but Spurs swooped in and signed him. I think he was meant to be a squad player but every time he steps in, he's fantastic. He doesn't do anything wrong. He just delivers on what he's supposed to do.\n\nLisandro Martinez (Manchester United): He's only 5ft7, 5ft8 and he had Nick Woltemade in his back pocket all day. It was really good to see him back playing after his massive injury. Him being back fit is monumental, not only for him but his World Cup aspirations as well.\n\nRyan Gravenberch (Liverpool): His influence is very simple: if he plays well, Liverpool play well. Obviously he got a goal against a Wolves team that they had to break down, nice finish. You don't really get that much credit for scoring against Wolves if I'm being totally honest, but he was very instrumental.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): Probably his best game since the first game of the season against Wolves. Not only the goal but his impact on the game. He's starting to show what he did at AC Milan. I really like him as a player.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): Again, he scored against Wolves - who will probably go down as the worst team in Premier League history - but he's growing into it and starting to fill into the shirt. Maybe the absences of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have made players start to play through him - and he's starting to be the player we all believed he could be.\n\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City): For me, he's the best player in world football to watch at the moment. He tries things and he's confident on the ball. Even when he makes mistakes, he doesn't care and tries again. He finished the weekend with a goal and an assist. He's the most exciting footballer to watch at this moment in time, and I say that over Lamine Yamal and everyone else.\n\nKevin Schade (Brentford): If you score a hat-trick, you end up in the Team of the Week. It's as simple as that. I nearly put Keith Andrews as the manager of the week.\n\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): We don't normally put players in who start on the bench. However, we've broken our rules. He had such an impact in the second half against Chelsea that he has to go in.\n\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): Unbelievable result. Eleven wins on the bounce. I thought he not only got it spot-on tactically in the second-half, but his in-game managing and the changes he made - most notably when he brought on Ollie Watkins - showed the level he is currently operating at.\n\nHe outcoached Enzo Maresca, who everyone says is a top coach. I think he just showed the level of where he is truly at as a coach and what he can offer.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be sweating on the fitness of Mason Mount as he prepares for his side’s Premier League match against Wolves on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe former Chelsea man came off at half-time on Sunday in United’s 1-0 win over Newcastle. Amorim said post-match that he was hoping the injury was nothing serious.\n\nIf Mount does make it, an unchanged XI is expected, partly on merit after Sunday but also partly because there are few other options.\n\nHarry Maguire is back on the grass but is unlikely to be ready for action. Matthijs de Ligt and Bruno Fernandes are still injured, and Kobbie Mainoo is also unlikely to have recovered in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Nouss Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are still participating for their countries in AFCON. All three of their nations – Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon (respectively) – are expected to progress to the knockout stages, so they are unlikely to be back until around 10th January or even beyond.\n\nSenne Lammens will continue in goal. Amorim is likely to persist with a back four of Diogo Dalot, Sunday’s Man of the Match Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw.\n\nCasemiro and Manuel Ugarte will once again be the twin sixes. If fit, Mount will play in front of them. Patrick Dorgu was excellent on the right wing on Sunday, so is likely to continue there, with Matheus Cunha on the left and Ben Sesko up top.\n\nIf Mount does not make it, he could be replaced directly by Jack Fletcher as he was at half-time against the Magpies. Alternatively, the boss could revert to a back three, bringing in Leny Yoro as a third centre-back and pushing the full-backs up into wing-back roles.\n\nHowever, Amorim has hinted at more than one press conference that he is reluctant to play Shaw at wing-back due to the physical exertion involved.\n\nAnother possibility would be to play 4-2-3-1 with Josh Zirkzee sitting in behind Sesko. Given the opposition’s struggles this season, it would certainly be an option.\n\nGiven all that, here is our predicted XI for Tuesday’s 8.15pm kick-off:\n\nFeatured image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "You started your professional career in Finland, and one spell that stands out is your time at HJK Helsinki. You won the league and the cup there. How important was that period for you?\n\n“It was huge, to be honest. It is important to understand what you want and how you plan to achieve it. Everyone dreams of winning trophies and playing in the Champions League, but there is a process you have to follow.\n\n“When I arrived in Helsinki, people told me it would be difficult because I was not a local player. Through hard work, I secured my place in the starting eleven. We won the league in my first year. The season before, the club had been fighting to stay in the league and even had playoffs to survive.\n\n“I had a clause in my contract that allowed me to leave if they were relegated. They stayed up, we built a new team, and then won the league. The following season, we qualified for the Champions League. It was the first Finnish club to reach the group stage in 1998, and it still is.\n\n“Playing in the Champions League was incredible. You feel nervous at first, but once the anthem plays, the nerves disappear. I won the Players’ Player of the Year and top scorer. I won everything you can win in Finland, and that was the moment to move on.”\n\nYou moved to Stockport County. At first, you were playing regularly, then a change of manager reduced your game time. Despite that, there was still a lot of interest in you. How do you reflect on your time there?\n\n“It was a great time. It was exactly what I needed because moving from Finland to the Championship was a big jump. I was playing every week, and just before the manager left, I had a chance to join Blackburn.\n\n“The manager left on a Sunday, and on Monday, Blackburn called. They were in the Premier League with Graeme Souness as manager. The new manager at Stockport did not let the move happen.\n\n“Before joining Stockport, I had actually been at Wolves for a few days. They had watched me score five goals in two games in Finland and offered me a contract, but my agent messed things up. I went back to Finland, and a week later, Stockport called.\n\n“They told me that if I joined and we stayed up, they would not stand in the way of a move to a bigger club. It was not written down, but that was the agreement. When the Blackburn move did not happen, I was disappointed, but I then moved to Sheffield Wednesday and continued from there.”\n\n“I loved those games. After playing in the Champions League, your confidence and belief grow because you have played at the highest level.\n\n“The derbies were special. I scored in most of them, and I always thought about the fans. Derby matches are for them. Before the season even begins, those are the fixtures everyone looks for.”\n\nYour time at Sheffield Wednesday was successful from a personal perspective and led to you joining Ipswich Town. How do you reflect on your time there overall?\n\n“I loved Sheffield Wednesday. The club is huge, and the supporters are fantastic. But it was the right club at the wrong time for me. They were in a difficult financial position after relegation from the Premier League.\n\n“The move to Ipswich came through Willie Donachie, who had been assistant manager at Sheffield Wednesday. Joe Royle got the job at Ipswich. Willie joined him, and two days later, he called me asking if I wanted to come on loan. That is how it happened.”\n\nAt Ipswich, you played alongside Darren Bent. You were scoring goals and became the club’s leading scorer. What was that spell like?\n\n“Ipswich felt like home. I remember that Willie Donachie picked me up on Saturday morning, the day after everything had been agreed. We drove to Watford to meet the team at the hotel.\n\n“Joe Royle told me I would start on the bench because I had not trained. We were 1–0 down at halftime. A few minutes before the break, I was told to warm up. I came on and scored with my first touch. Jim Magilton scored the second, and we won 2–1. After that, we won seven matches in a row.\n\n“Playing with Darren Bent was like a dream. He was young, fast, skinny, and a great finisher. We scored so many simple goals. I would win the header from a goal kick, and he would run through and score. You could see immediately that he would have a great career.”\n\nYour performances attracted interest from Blackburn, and you got the chance to play in the Premier League. Was that a dream come true?\n\n“Yes, absolutely. I spent two and a half years at Ipswich, and we reached the playoffs twice. In the first season, we lost to West Ham, and in the second season, we missed automatic promotion and lost to West Ham again.\n\n“I always said that if Ipswich had been promoted, I probably would never have left. I had a very strong connection with the club. When my contract was finishing, the chairman, David Sheepshanks, told me that he knew the dream was to play in the Premier League. They could not offer that at the time, but he did not want to stand in my way. He also told me that if I did not sign for a Premier League club, to speak to him first because he was ready to offer something he had never offered before.\n\n“That meant a lot. Leaving was not easy, even to play in the Premier League. But signing for Blackburn was a dream come true.”\n\nWhat was it like working under Mark Hughes, and how do you reflect on your time at Blackburn?\n\n“I think I did well. In my first Premier League season, I scored seven or eight goals and played regularly. We had Craig Bellamy, who was great to play with. He was very quick and worked hard.\n\n“In January, the club signed Sinama Pongolle on loan from Liverpool, and after that, I did not start as many matches. I always felt that if I had continued to play as much as I had before January, I would have reached double figures in goals.\n\n“Mark Hughes was very quiet but very honest. His presence said a lot because of the clubs he had played for. He always said his door was open if you wanted to talk. He did not speak a lot, but when he walked into a room, you felt it.”\n\nWhen you were leaving Blackburn, Gordon Strachan showed strong interest in signing you for Celtic. How close was that deal?\n\n“I think it was close. I was told about the situation, and there was also interest from Everton. Blackburn reached a point where I had to make a decision. Crystal Palace came in as well, and they wanted to get back to the Premier League.\n\n“If everything had fallen into place, I would have gone to Celtic. But you never really know how close a deal is. I have travelled up and down the country many times, thinking something was close. I learned that until a deal is done, it is never close.”\n\nYou joined Crystal Palace when the club was desperate to return to the Premier League, and Simon Jordan was in charge. What was it like playing for Palace?\n\n“Palace had a very good team at the time. The squad was strong, but I think we had too many egos. There were too many players who felt they had to play, and the atmosphere was not right.\n\nIn successful teams, there is banter, togetherness, and a real spirit. I never felt we had that at Palace.\n\n“Peter Taylor was the manager. As a person, he was one of the nicest men you could meet. He was a gentleman who never wanted to upset anyone. Sometimes, though, a manager needs a tougher side. With the big characters in the squad, I felt we lacked that strength from the manager.”\n\nAfter leaving Palace, you moved to Germany to TuS Koblenz and ended up playing alongside your brother. What was that experience like?\n\n“It was something I always dreamed of. I went to Germany because my brother was there. I wanted to play with him before the end of my career.\n\n“He moved to England very young and signed for Birmingham in the Premier League, but he suffered some bad injuries. Technically, he was better than me. He was taller, more skilful, and very talented. Mentally, I was a bit different, and that helped me in my career.\n\n“When he went to the second tier in Germany, I visited him a few times. Eventually, I decided to join him. Playing together was special. Sharing the pitch with your brother is an incredible feeling.”\n\nYou later returned to the UK and worked under Brendan Rodgers at Swansea. What was it like working with him?\n\n“I knew straight away he was going to have a top career. The standards he set were very high. Everything was organised. Even though Swansea did not have the training facilities they have today, everything felt professional and prepared.\n\n“He demanded a lot from himself first. Players see that. Modern players are clever, and they can tell immediately if a manager drops his standards. Brendan never did. His success does not surprise me. I still keep in touch with him, and he is someone I admire.”\n\nWhen you left Swansea, you were in the Championship with a club aiming for the Premier League. Did you expect to return to the Premier League with a team like Newcastle?\n\n“Honestly, no. Not with a club of that size. When I was at Ipswich, Sir Bobby Robson tried to sign me for Newcastle, so I already knew how huge the club was.\n\n“When the call came, it was a great surprise. You see the Newcastle fans on television, standing in the winter with no shirts on, but you only understand it once you go there. The passion is unbelievable. After a few months, I understood exactly why someone like Alan Shearer never left, even when he had offers from top clubs. The connection with the supporters is special.\n\n“Brendan Rodgers told me honestly that I was not in his plans at Swansea. It hurts at first, but honesty helps you move on. We agreed to terminate the contract because the window was closing, and I wanted options. Then Newcastle called. I felt like a ten-year-old kid. I could not wait to drive up there the next morning.”\n\nAfter Newcastle, you had spells at Oldham Athletic and then Hibernian. How do you reflect on those final stages of your career?\n\n“Newcastle helped me find myself again, but I actually think I finished my career a little too early. I always put pressure on myself, and I had already started my coaching badges. I knew I wanted to go into management.\n\n“Paul Dickov, who I played with at Blackburn, brought me to Oldham. He told me I would play every week and that one day there might even be a chance to take over after him. I wanted to experience League One because it would help me understand another level of the game. I had a good time there.\n\n“Then Hibs came in. Pat Fenlon called me every day. I saw the derby against Hearts, and the atmosphere was fantastic. The training ground was excellent. It felt like the right move.\n\n“But Hibs was the most disappointing part of my career. I barely played. I had maybe one or two starts. I had spent my career in the Championship and Premier League, and suddenly I could not get on the pitch. That situation made me decide to retire.\n\n“I have always been honest. If someone is better than me, fine. But sitting on the bench or being left out entirely is not for me. I train all week for Saturday. If I am not involved, then I want to move on. That is why I changed clubs fairly often.”\n\nFinally, Shefki, who were your toughest individual opponents in the Premier League?\n\n“Rio Ferdinand was always incredibly tough. He was not only strong in the air but also extremely quick. Even if he made a mistake, he could recover immediately, which made him very hard to play against.\n\n“John Terry was another one I really enjoyed battling with. He was brave and physical and would put his head where others would not put their feet. That suited my style because I always loved the fight.”",

    "description": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was rewarded for a change in style and formation with a hard-fought win over Newcastle in the Premier League.",
    "fullText": "As a football idealist, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has specific beliefs about how the game should be played - and the best way to win.\n\nBut his usual philosophy was not the one that brought the Christmas present of a 1-0 Premier League win over Newcastle.\n\nFor one thing, there was the formation switch.\n\nAmorim joked in September that not even the Pope could persuade him to change, but for the first time since he took charge 13 months ago, he fielded a back four.\n\nFor another, victory was achieved with 33.4% possession, their lowest in any game this season. It was United's lowest percentage of possession in a victory since the 29.4% they had when beating against Manchester City in January 2023.\n\nThey had nine shots at Old Trafford compared to Newcastle's 16. The visitors had 43 touches in their opponents' box. Amorim's men had 15.\n\nYet it was Manchester United who prevailed, thanks to a combination of Patrick Dorgu's first goal for the club - which was a sublime first-half volley from the edge of the area - and only a second clean sheet of the season.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. But even for Amorim, sometimes there are days when substance trumps style.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unequivocal reply when asked if this was one of the 'most satisfying' wins of his, at times, tortuous 13 months in charge.\n\n\"The feeling is good. If you compared to other games, we suffered so much more today but in certain moments we put everything on the line.\n\n\"We are defending every cross. Especially if you see the second half, sometimes we managed to defend with a back six.\n\n\"We had so many games when we controlled the opponent so much better, but it is a good feeling to have a clean sheet. We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"",

    "fullText": "Florian Wirtz's first Liverpool goal fired the Reds into the Premier League's top four despite an unconvincing 2-1 win over Wolves on a day both clubs paid tribute to Diogo Jota.\n\nJota, who was killed in a car accident in July, won four trophies after joining Liverpool from Wolves in 2020.\n\nTwo of his children led the teams out as mascots, while his wife Rute Cardoso watched on from the sidelines.\n\nBoth sets of fans sang chants in Jota's name in the 18th and 20th minutes -- the shirt numbers he wore during his spells at Molineux and Anfield respectively.\n\nOn the field, both clubs have suffered this season with Wolves staring down the barrel of relegation after taking just two points from their opening 18 league games.\n\nLiverpool's form has improved of late and Wirtz is beginning to show flashes of the brilliance that lured the English champions into paying Bayer Leverkusen £100 million ($135 million) for the German international.\n\nThe 22-year-old registered his first Premier League assist last weekend for a goal that came at some cost to Liverpool as Alexander Isak suffered a broken leg in opening the scoring against Tottenham.\n\nShorn of the most expensive player in English football history for the coming months, there is even more pressure on Wirtz to deliver on his hefty price tag.\n\nHe finally opened his account in his 23rd Liverpool appearance by prodding home Hugo Ekitike's pass to double the home side's lead.\n\nJust 90 seconds earlier, Liverpool had made the breakthrough when Ryan Gravenberch slammed in Jeremie Frimpong's cross.\n\nYet, even with a 2-0 half-time lead against a side on course to become the worst in Premier League history, Arne Slot could not relax.\n\nSantiago Bueno exposed Liverpool's frailty from set-pieces to pull a goal back just six minutes into the second half.\n\nSlot's men have made a habit of late collapses at Leeds and Tottenham in recent weeks and needed a perfectly-timed tackle from Conor Bradley to deny Jhon Arias a late equaliser.",

    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta hailed the “incredible” way his Arsenal squad have dealt with continued setbacks this season after beating Brighton 2-1 to go back to the top of the Premier League.\n\nMartin Odegaard put the Gunners in front on 14 minutes before a Georginio Rutter own goal made it two for Arteta’s side.\n\nBut Diego Gomez set up a nervy ending to the game, with Arsenal again managing to secure a narrow win.\n\nArsenal were without Jurrien Timber through injury for the game, while Riccardo Calafiori pulled out of the starting 11 in the warm up.\n\nAnd Arteta praised his Arsenal players for their adaptability, though says the scoreline should have been more comfortable.\n\n“Very happy with the performance, individually and collectively, so dominant, we were a big threat,” he said.\n\n“So very pleased with all of that.\n\n“But the margin should have been much bigger, I mean with the amount of situations, chances, open chances that we generated through the game. It should never be 2-1.\n\n“But that’s the Premier League, that’s the step that we have to make. I think the first shot that they had they scored the goal and then David (Raya) has to make another save to maintain the result.\n\n“But what I like is that we’re having a lot of issues, we’re dealing with it in an incredible way. Yesterday we lost Jurrien, today we lost Calafiori in the warm-up. Declan has to play as a full-back and you see the performance that he put in. So that’s the spirit and that’s how much our players want it.”\n\nOn Calafiori’s injury, Arteta added: “It’s something that he felt yesterday, something very awkward that happened and today in the warm-up he wasn’t comfortable.”\n\nArsenal have again struggled with persistent injury problems this season, and asked how long his side can survive with these problems, Arteta responded: “I don’t know. At the moment we survive six months, so let’s see. It’s another five and a half to go so hopefully things will get better.\n\n“The good news as well, for example, we got Gabi (Gabriel) back earlier than expected, which is great. The medical staff have done an incredible job. The way he pushes himself as well. That’s what we need because we lost one and we got somebody else back.”",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have accumulated the fewest disciplinary points in the league, with 22 points made up entirely of yellow cards, placing them ahead of Manchester City and Leeds United, who both sit on 27 points.\n\nThe figures mark a clear shift from last season, when Arsenal were shown three red cards in their opening eight league matches.\n\nThose dismissals involved Declan Rice, Leandro Trossard and William Saliba, with Rice and Trossard sent off for kicking the ball away and delaying the restart against Brighton & Hove Albion and Manchester City.\n\nThey have not received any red cards so far this season.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Saturday’s home match against Brighton, Arteta said he believes a change in how the laws are being applied has played a role in Arsenal’s improved red card record.\n\n“I think the rules are different now,” he said.\n\n“So, we paid a big price with that (delaying the restart) rule, and hopefully that stays away and we continue to play with 11 players.”\n\nArteta also reflected on Rice’s dismissal at the Emirates Stadium in August last year, admitting the manner of that performance left a lasting impression.\n\n“I remember it very well,” he said. “I was very hacked off in the manner that we played with 10 men. So hopefully it is going to be very different this time.”\n\nAsked about Arsenal’s position at the top of the fair play standings, Arteta said he was unaware of the statistic but welcomed it.\n\n“I didn’t know. That is good, very good.”\n\nArsenal’s record leaves them ahead of several direct rivals, including Manchester United, Aston Villa and Liverpool, while Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea sit at the bottom of the table.",

    "description": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was rewarded for a change in style and formation with a hard-fought win over Newcastle in the Premier League.",
    "fullText": "As a football idealist, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has specific beliefs about how the game should be played - and the best way to win.\n\nBut his usual philosophy was not the one that brought the Christmas present of a 1-0 Premier League win over Newcastle.\n\nFor one thing, there was the formation switch.\n\nAmorim joked in September that not even the Pope could persuade him to change, but for the first time since he took charge 13 months ago, he fielded a back four.\n\nFor another, victory was achieved with 33.4% possession, their lowest in any game this season. It was United's lowest percentage of possession in a victory since the 29.4% they had when beating against Manchester City in January 2023.\n\nThey had nine shots at Old Trafford compared to Newcastle's 16. The visitors had 43 touches in their opponents' box. Amorim's men had 15.\n\nYet it was Manchester United who prevailed, thanks to a combination of Patrick Dorgu's first goal for the club - which was a sublime first-half volley from the edge of the area - and only a second clean sheet of the season.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. But even for Amorim, sometimes there are days when substance trumps style.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unequivocal reply when asked if this was one of the 'most satisfying' wins of his, at times, tortuous 13 months in charge.\n\n\"The feeling is good. If you compared to other games, we suffered so much more today but in certain moments we put everything on the line.\n\n\"We are defending every cross. Especially if you see the second half, sometimes we managed to defend with a back six.\n\n\"We had so many games when we controlled the opponent so much better, but it is a good feeling to have a clean sheet. We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe headed back to the north-east of England reflecting on yet another disappointing away performance. He admitted his side failed to turn their territorial advantage into the type and volume of meaningful chances that would have earned maximum points.\n\nBut for the home side, the outcome felt significant.\n\nLisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are at other ends of the experience scale.\n\nOne is a World Cup winner, albeit one just returning from the latest in a sequence of bad injuries. The other is a 19-year-old with 15 senior appearances under his belt – who has now extended the longest playing sequence of his first-team career to five games.\n\nPaired together in the middle of a revised back four, with Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot as full-backs and Dorgu switched to the right side of Amorim's attack, Martinez and Heaven were immense.\n\n\"He [Martinez] is a guy with a lot of character,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"He is really good on the ball - and has won a World Cup, so he is used to that stress - but he showed today he is a top player.\n\n\"He is a small guy but today he did well against a team with tall players.\"\n\nThe sight of 5ft 9in Martinez leaping high to win a header against 6ft 6in Nick Woltemade in the first half was impressive.\n\nEven though there was an element of Amorim having to protect a player starting for the first time since February following his recovery from cruciate knee ligament surgery, there must have been concern when Martinez left the field two minutes from time and 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson came on in his place.\n\nFredricson did his job well. But he had Heaven with him to bring more solidity.\n\nIt is hard to believe when the former Arsenal youngster started against West Ham on 4 December, he was booked almost immediately and looked so shaky, it was almost a shock he lasted until half-time when he was replaced by Leny Yoro.\n\nIn the space of five games and three weeks, Heaven has advanced rapidly.\n\nHe was excellent in the defeat at Aston Villa on 21 December and followed that up with a performance of maturity against Newcastle that earned him the host broadcaster's man-of-the-match award.\n\nSo good has Heaven been that Amorim is warning Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, currently sidelined, they can't be certain of getting their places back when they are fit again.\n\nThat is significant in two ways. Firstly, De Ligt was, by common consent, United's best defender until a back injury ruled him out of the West Ham game. Maguire, meanwhile, is still waiting to learn whether United will offer him a new contract when his current one expires in the summer.\n\n\"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He trained really well, which shows if you train well, it can help you play.\n\n\"If he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "The article below is an excerpt from the members-only Friday edition of the Miguel Delaney: Inside Football newsletter.\n\nTo read the full article and get my latest reporting, insight, and commentary delivered straight to your inbox, become a member here. A free edition is also sent on Mondays – you can \n\nAs Premier League squads begin physically conditioning themselves for the Christmas schedule from mid-December, the former players among the coaching staff often find themselves laughing at how it used to be.\n\nBack in the mid-1990s, it could mean four games in nine – or even eight – days. There were barely any breaks. It already sounds unhealthy for players, but it was also about how it felt. Some from the mid-2000s now shake their heads at how their main memory of the period wasn’t jaded legs or turkey at the training ground, but an upset stomach. That was because many players effectively had “caffeine routines” on matchdays, which they then had to repeat again and again in quick succession.\n\nI used to ghostwrite a column for Stephen Hunt, and he told me that for a 3pm kick-off it would be two coffees in the morning, followed by a Red Bull – or an energy drink called Phase 1, the equivalent of around six coffees – and usually some caffeine tablets on top. Their heart rate would already be elevated before they played, and they could barely eat afterwards because their stomach was so raw.\n\nOn the sound of that, it probably ought to form part of the argument over whether caffeine should be banned from football.\n\nPreparation is obviously far more scientific now, even if those discarded snus pouches have become a familiar sight around some training grounds.\n\nAt the very least, we are long past the point where the congested Christmas schedule functioned as a mini stress test for a team’s endurance over the season. There even used to be some correlation between who collected the most points at Christmas and who eventually won the league.\n\nThis season, the schedule more closely resembles a standard European rhythm. All teams are playing four games across 11 to 13 days – weekend, midweek, weekend, midweek. Many are well used to that cadence, even if the fact that every one of these matches is a Premier League game brings a different level of intensity.\n\nWhat this spell now offers is a test of a different kind – and one that hints at a broader evolution in football. It is the shift from manager-led clubs to what might be called “performance-led” clubs: organisations where science dictates decision-making at every level.\n\nThat may sound surprising given that every coaching staff is now surrounded by reams of data. The difference, however, lies in how much those decisions are actually shaped by it.\n\nIt has become the bane of some sporting directors’ careers.\n\nTo keep reading and unlock the full Friday edition of Miguel Delaney: Inside Football, \n\nTo receive the free, Monday newsletter simply enter your email address in the box at the top of this page.\n\nYou can also head to our newsletter preference centre to \n\nOnce there, all you need to do is press the ‘+’ button and enter your email address.\n\nMiguel Delaney's Inside Football newsletter lands in your inbox every Monday and Friday (The Independent)",

    "fullText": "Juventus are reportedly laying the groundwork for a significant defensive reinforcement as they keep a close watch on the Premier League. According to transfer expert Matteo Moretto, as relayed by IlBianconero, the Bianconeri have set their sights on Bournemouth’s Marcos Senesi.\n\nThe Argentine center-back is emerging as a concrete summer target for the Turin giants, largely due to his precarious contract situation. With his current deal with the Cherries set to expire in June 2026, the upcoming summer window represents the final opportunity for Bournemouth to secure a significant fee, or risk losing him for nothing. Juventus are attentive to these dynamics as they look to add quality and international experience to their backline.\n\nThis is not the first time Senesi’s name has crossed the desks at Continassa. The report clarifies that Juventus have been given the chance to sign the former Feyenoord man in previous transfer windows, but a deal never materialized. Now, with a more favorable economic outlook and a clear need for a left-footed defender, the “Old Lady” appears ready to reignite their interest.\n\nWhile a January move seems unlikely given Bournemouth’s desire to keep him for their survival battle, Juve are positioning themselves at the front of the queue for July. Senesi’s familiarity with high-tempo football and his ball-playing ability make him an ideal fit for the project currently being built in Turin.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Manchester City at the City Ground (kick-off 12:30 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\nOla Aina is \"progressing well\" in his recovery from a hamstring injury but is still rebuilding his fitness. He played for the B team on Monday night and came through the match \"fine and injury-free\". It is \"another step forward\" for the defender.\n\nOn the lack of intensity and urgency shown in the defeat to Fulham, Dyche said: \"You have to park these things pretty quickly. We did well overall, we weren't a million miles off. It wasn't the intensity we showed in the Tottenham game or out in Utrecht though.\"\n\nHe added: \"The game was a bit flat in general. Our fans were terrific, they were trying to get the team going, as was I. Sometimes the hardest thing is when everyone is having a bit of a down day.\"\n\nIt is \"unlikely\" that he will be weighing his players, like Pep Guardiola, before the Manchester City game. He joked: \"Is he weighing himself, do you think? One rule for one - come on, Pep!\"\n\nHe explained his philosophy around the festive period: \"I just look for my players to have a bit of common sense. I don't mind them having a Christmas dinner, why not?\" He believes \"psychology is important as anything with athletes\" and Christmas Day is \"a big part\" of life.\n\nFitness is \"very important\" but he isn't \"obsessed over weights\". He will \"encourage\" his players to \"enjoy\" the festivities, especially because they don't play until 27 December.\n\nOn opposition manager Guardiola, Dyche said: \"It is fantastic what he has achieved, there's no two ways about it. Only Sir Alex Ferguson probably tops him. He has done massive things for himself, his players and football in general.\"\n\nThe Reds will be hoping Manchester City are \"having a quiet day\" when they visit the City Ground. However, Forest will still need to play \"very well\" because they are facing a team who are \"always prepared\".\n\nDyche added: \"It's unlikely we are going to dominate the ball, so we have to be defensively sound and do all the hard yards.\"\n\nNottingham Forest's Premier League win-loss-win-loss-win-loss form \"will do\" this season, \"if it keeps going\". He explained: \"If you do the stats, if that carried on for the whole season then it would equal a pretty good situation.\"\n\nHowever, the biggest thing for Dyche is the team \"finding consistency\" - whether that be in terms of their \"training schedule or performances\" - but he recognises that will take time.\n\nHe is predicting a \"slow\" January transfer window because of the club's investment in the summer. On the other hand, he added: \"The club have shown that if players become available at the right times, they can make things happen - so you never know.\"\n\nFollow all of Tuesday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): I know a lot of people will say \"it was 3-0 against West Ham\". But he made four or five massive saves in the early part of the second half, which kept them ahead and gave them a fighting chance to win. Manchester City have been good, but not setting the world alight defensively. Donnarumma has to keep providing and turning up with big performances.\n\nReece James (Chelsea): We have had Reece in the team a few times and, ahead of the World Cup, he looks the real deal. We have never questioned his ability, but he falls into the 'if he is fit' category. At the moment he has not had an injury for a year and touch wood that continues. His free-kick in the draw at Newcastle was a pearler.\n\nPiero Hincapie (Arsenal): Slightly going under the radar for Arsenal. They brought him in late, when other people were looking at him, and he has been excellent. A solid performance against Everton.\n\nJoachim Andersen (Fulham): For years he has come with class for Fulham. He hits that lovely raking diagonal pass and his organisational skills also help. He organises and marshalls that defence, and did so again against Forest. He is very astute.\n\nAntonee Robinson (Fulham): It is good to see him back. A big season with a World Cup coming up and he is vital for the United States. He had some tough times with injuries but is starting to show he is getting back to his best.\n\nKeane Lewis-Potter (Brentford): He has previously been deployed at full-back but now we are starting to see him in his more favoured position further up the field. Two wonderful goals in a huge game for Brentford at Wolves and a win that has probably already sealed their survival.\n\nEthan Ampadu (Leeds): I really, really like this player. I like what he is about. Not only has he grown as a player since he left Chelsea but he has grown as a human and a real leader. Big tackles, big moments, he is always there and got a goal in the victory against Palace.\n\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa): The man of the moment. Two goals again - both wonderful finishes against Manchester United. Is Rogers the guy to lead England? Do you leave out Bellingham? Foden? Palmer? Just how well he is playing would suggest you would have to have a serious conversation about it. He has seven goals for Villa and is flying.\n\nNick Woltemade (Newcastle): He scored two goals and should probably have got a hat-trick against Chelsea at the weekend. It looks like the return of Yoane Wissa has given him a little spark and put that devil back in him. He is scoring and getting in the right positions. A few weeks ago he went off the boil a bit and maybe he had got a bit comfortable.\n\nErling Haaland (Manchester City): The guvnor, the king. He scored two but probably should have got four if I am being really critical. He is just a machine. His next goal will be his 150th in all competitions for Manchester City in five years. Let that sink in. That is frightening. You could put him in my team every week.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin (Leeds): People are asking if he could make a sneaky run into the England set-up for the summer. I think it would be a big ask considering the amount of injuries he has had over the course of his career. Right now let's just enjoy him being back, fit and playing - and when he is fit and playing he scores goals. That's all that really matters.\n\nDaniel Farke (Leeds United): A brilliant victory against Crystal Palace. Only two weeks ago, people were saying Palace were top-four contenders and were also saying Farke was under real pressure. Now, when you look at it, Leeds are probably favoured to stay up from this position. They have given themselves a fighting chance and this was easily the result of the weekend.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

Both have now scored 11 from 11.\n\nChelsea's Cole Palmer went ahead of Toure when he scored two penalties against Tottenham in December 2024, giving him 12 from 12, but he then had a penalty saved against Leicester in March to end his 100% strike rate.\n\nJimenez now needs two more successful penalties to become the Premier League player to score the most successful spot-kicks before missing one.\n\nOn waiting for the goalkeeper to move before striking the ball, he said: \"It's always what I do. I do it well, so it's something I have been training my whole career. I like to have this pressure with these penalties. I'm happy to score.\n\n\"I've never missed [a penalty in the Premier League]. I'm really happy about that, so I want to keep doing it like that. More penalties to come, I'll be there.\"\n\nBryan Mbeumo joined the 100% club when he made it 10 from 10 in April but that perfect record was ended when he had a penalty saved for Brentford against Fulham a month later.\n\nFormer Brentford team-mate Ivan Toney was another who had scored 10 out of 10 but he was unable to match Toure's record when he missed his 11th penalty against Newcastle in 2023.",

    "fullText": "A Liverpool man has denied racially abusing Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo during a match at Anfield earlier this season.\n\nMark Mogan, 47, of Templehill Close, Dovecot, appeared at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court on Monday where he pleaded not guilty to an offence of racially aggravated disorderly behaviour against the Bournemouth star.\n\nMogan, who appeared in person in court, spoke only to confirm his name and address and enter his plea.\n\nMogan’s trial is scheduled to take place on April 22 next year, with Semenyo expected to attend the proceedings, the court heard.\n\nMogan was released on bail on condition that he does not contact Semenyo directly or indirectly, or make reference to him on social media.\n\nHe was also banned from attending any regulated football grounds as part of his bail conditions, the court was told.\n\nThe incident is alleged to have happened at the Liverpool v Bournemouth fixture in the Premier League on August 15, Merseyside Police previously said.\n\nSemenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator during the first Premier League game of the season.\n\nMatch referee Anthony Taylor stopped play in the 29th minute and a man was ejected from the Anfield stadium.\n\nSemenyo, 25, scored twice in the second half to help bring Bournemouth back from two goals down at Anfield before Liverpool went on to eventually win 4-2.\n\nA spokesperson for Liverpool Football Club said in August it was aware of the allegation of racist abuse and that “we condemn racism and discrimination in all forms, it has no place in society, or football”.\n\nThe Football Association said it was “concerned” about the allegation of racism towards Semenyo and that it would ensure “appropriate action” would be taken.\n\nBournemouth are due to face Liverpool again in the Premier League, this time at the Vitality Stadium, next month.",

    "fullText": "Wayne Rooney has backed Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice to become the next captain of England.\n\nRice has been a standout in Arsenal’s run to the top of the Premier League table this season and impressed Rooney during the club’s 1-0 win at Everton on Saturday evening.\n\nThe ex-England captain hailed Rice’s display at The Hill Dickinson Stadium and believes the 26-year-old is now ‘irreplaceable’ for club and country. Discussing what’s next for Rice, Rooney believes he is the outstanding candidate to become England captain, when Harry Kane departs international football.\n\n“For me, he’s the one who’s probably waiting for Harry to hang up his boots at some point,” Rooney told BBC Sport’s The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n“He was all over the pitch [against Everton]. His decision-making – when to pass it, where to pass it, what foot to pass it to, his detail on his pass – it was a pleasure to watch. He was absolutely incredible.\n\n“He was splitting centre-backs, taking the ball off [Arsenal’s] centre-backs, acting as a third centre-back, then next minute he’s in the box, trying to score a goal. Sometimes, some of the stuff he does is a bit underrated.\n\n“He’s the right one to take over [Kane] for me, because [of] his drive, his personality. Everyone seems to love him, who knows him, who’s close to him. He’s irreplaceable for England.”\n\nRead – Five things we learned from the Premier League weekend\n\nSee more – Premier League Team of the Week – Ballard, Cherki, Rogers\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "fullText": "Manchester City picked up a comfortable 3-nil win over West Ham at the Etihad Stadium yesterday to maintain the pressure on Premier League leaders Arsenal. A brace from Erling Haaland and a first-half goal from Tijjani Reijnders were enough to see City pick up a valuable three points. Pep Guardiola’s side barely had to get out of second gear yesterday against a struggling West Ham side. They made it seven consecutive wins in all competitions with their victory yesterday. But while City are racking up the wins, Pep Guardiola threw down a challenge to his players after their win yesterday. He believes that his team needs to go up a level to contend for silverware this season.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 3-nil win over West Ham, Pep Guardiola said he wants to see more from his team. He specifically spoke on their play in possession as an area that needs to improve. The Manchester City manager explained: “We are happy to win but the way we are with the ball, we have to improve otherwise it will not be enough to be title contenders in March, April and May.”\n\n“Always I have to thank Erling for the goals but today thanks to him, Phil and Nico O’Reilly, they help us a lot to do this game.”\n\n“Defensively we are improving and we can visualise it but with the ball, we are away from what we have to do. We are not close. The way we attack depends on how the opponents defend, we have to be in the right spots to make it more fluid and we were not.”\n\n“We are happy, we cannot deny we are in the Champions League spots, the semi-final of the Carabao Cup and up there in the Premier League.”\n\nA more telling quote from Pep Guardiola came when he urged his team to follow him and continue to improve. He added: “We will be there. If they follow me, we will be there, but we have to improve.”\n\n“I know the level but it’s not enough. The spirit, the aggression, the hunger is there. All the attributes they need that is not highlights. Many things, we have to do better.”\n\nEven though Manchester City have won seven consecutive matches in all competitions, Pep Guardiola’s assessment is on the money. There are obvious areas where this City team can improve. They were on display early in the second half of yesterday’s match. Manchester City struggled to play out from the back at the beginning of the second half. One misplaced pass from Bernardo Silva almost gifted West Ham a way back into the game. That is one clear area of City’s play that needs to improve. Manchester City have struggled at times this season to play out from the back, and that is a major area in which City can improve.\n\nThere are of course others. Pep Guardiola’s side is yet to establish the control of matches that they typically have and have built their play around. They were better in this regard yesterday but this portion of their play remains a work in progress. The major positive is that City are well placed to launch into the second half of this season despite having so many areas of their play which can improve. That is a major positive to take from Manchester City’s strong recent run of results.\n\nPep Guardiola has laid down the gauntlet to his team. He wants to see them to continue to improve so they can contend for silverware this season. Manchester City are entering a phase of the season where they have typically launched into title winning campaigns. But this is a new-look City team that needs to improve to match what their predecessors were able to do so often in the past. If this City team can follow suit anything is possible for Pep Guardiola’s side this season.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal will spend Christmas Day on top of the Premier League tree this year, while Wolves, Burnley and West Ham are hanging precariously on the bottom branches.\n\nAs we approach the halfway point of the season, what do the ghosts of Christmas past tell us about the title race and relegation battle?\n\nThe team that is top of the Premier League on Christmas Day has gone on to win the title in 17 of the previous 33 seasons – basically a flip of a chocolate coin.\n\nHowever, Arsenal themselves have a much bleaker record as they've been top at Christmas four times before but have never gone on to lift the trophy.\n\nThe Gunners had only been top at this stage twice before Mikel Arteta took charge, but this is the third time in four seasons that they sit top of the tree at Christmas.\n\nTheir fans will hope that the wisdom Arteta's men have received in seasons past will see them finally hold off Manchester City and deliver the gift they've been wishing for since 2004.\n\n\"You'd like to think that through all the experiences that Arsenal have had being top at Christmas, they can understand the mistakes made in the back half of some seasons that stopped them from winning the title,\" former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha told Football Focus.\n\nThere isn't a lot of room for error though as Arsenal have a slender lead of just two points, while the average lead by the team top on Christmas Day is four points.\n\nIn fact, the only table-toppers at Christmas to have a smaller lead than Arsenal in the last 12 seasons were the Gunners themselves two years ago.\n\nBut while a two-point lead isn't much, history suggests it might be enough.\n\nArsenal are the eighth side in Premier League history to have a two-point lead at Christmas and five of the previous seven went on to win the title, including the last four.\n\nBizarrely Arsenal are the only side to win the Premier League without ever doing it when they were top at Christmas, as all three of their titles came when chasing the leaders at this time of year.\n\nThey were sixth and an incredible 13 points behind leaders Man Utd in 1997-98, second and three points behind Newcastle in 2001-02 and third and one point behind Man Utd at Christmas time in 2003-04.\n\nThat 13-point deficit in 1997-98 is the most points a team has ever been behind the leaders at Christmas and won the title (Arsenal did have a game in hand), while the lowest the eventual champions have been in the table at this stage is eighth, by Manchester City in the Covid-delayed season of 2020-21.\n\nWeirdly the team in second on Christmas Day has gone on to win the title in only two of the past 17 seasons, although both times it was Manchester City who did so.\n\nIn fact, in the last five seasons where the leaders at Christmas did not go on to win the title, the Premier League was won each time by Manchester City.\n\nFor many Arsenal fans, there will be a sense of deja vu. Leading the Premier League at Christmas before being eaten up by a relentless Pep Guardiola side is something the Gunners have got a little bit used to.\n\nSeeing a seven-point lead over Manchester City cut to two in the space of five games won't exactly fill them with confidence either.\n\n\"We're back on top of the table but we're not watching City too much, or the other teams,\" said Bukayo Saka. \"We're in control now. We know if we win every week we'll stay there.\"\n\nArteta added: \"The only thing we can control is our own performance and results and we know how long it's going to be and how tough is this league. That's it.\"\n\nManchester City have obviously got history on their side. Guardiola has won the Premier League title six times, the Bundesliga three times with Bayern Munich and La Liga three times with Barcelona. Arteta has no league titles as a manager.\n\nGuardiola's squad are full of Premier League winners, players who know what it takes to end a campaign strong, while none of the Arsenal squad have won a Premier League – but have experienced losing leads over the past few seasons.\n\nWhy can't this season be different though? Manchester City look far from the relentless side they have in previous seasons – and have already lost four games this campaign, compared to Arsenal's two losses.\n\n\"We will be there. If they follow me we will be there but we have to improve,\" said Guardiola.\n\n\"I know the level in Europe, in the Premier League, I know Arsenal and the other teams and how tough they are. It is not enough.\n\n\"The spirit is there, last season we did not have the spirit or aggression or hunger - all the attributes they need. It is not about the highlights and how good the actions are, there is something that comes from inside where we will recover from the Club World Cup.\"\n\nCity's attack is flowing, having scored 10 more goals than Arsenal, but having also conceded six more – you feel the title race could be defined by whether City's goals can outshine Arsenal's solidity.\n\nOnly four times in 33 Premier League seasons has the side bottom on Christmas Day survived, with the most recent being Wolves in 2022-23.\n\nBut with just two points won and a record 16 points from safety, it would take not just a Christmas miracle but a New Year's, Valentine's and Easter one too for bottom side Wolves to survive once again.\n\nSecond-bottom Burnley have a fighting chance as almost half the teams in their position at Christmas have stayed up, although the only time that's happened in the past eight seasons was when Eddie Howe led Newcastle to 11th in 2021-22.\n\nWest Ham fans have the most reason to be optimistic as the team in 18th has survived in two out of three seasons on average, most recently Nottingham Forest in 2022-23 and Wolves last time out.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that one of West Ham, Burnley and Wolves will stay up as that's happened just over half the time, with two teams surviving in 12 of the previous 33 seasons.\n\nThe three teams bottom at Christmas have never all survived while only four times in Premier League history have all three been relegated, although two of those occurred recently in 2020-21 and 2023-24.\n\nIn terms of who could be relegated in their place, the team flying highest at Christmas that ultimately went down were Norwich in 1994-95, who were seventh with 30 points and 11 points above the drop.\n\nThat was in a 42-game season though. In a 38-game campaign, the best team on Christmas Day to be relegated were Blackpool in 2010-11, who were 10th with 22 points but finished 19th with 39 points.\n\nNewcastle in 2008-09 were 12th with 22 points and went down, while the most points a relegated side has been above the bottom three at Christmas is seven by Reading in 2007-08, who were 12th with 21 points.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

Still we're not brave enough to break the lines and do it. But I'm really happy about position in the table, we are close to the top of the league, Champions League we are there, Carabao Cup semis. We are missing seven players now - five injured, two AFCON - that is tough to handle for many games. But we have to improve.\"\n\nOn Erling Haaland: \"The goals, he scores a lot for us, but today I have to thank him for the intensity. Him, Phil Foden and Nico O'Reilly they helped us a lot with the intensity.\"\n\nMidfielder Tijjani Reijnders, speaking to BBC's Match of the Day:\n\n\"Only the beginning of the second half we didn't start quite so well. Big part of the game we controlled it and we could have made more chances if we were more secure in certain situations.\"\n\nOn settling in at the club: \"It's new, I think, for every player who comes here. The tactics are different from my other clubs; the guys help me a lot with adjusting, and I feel pretty settled here.\n\n\"It's good. We put on a very good streak. For us, we have to keep going. It's not finished. Keep pressure on Arsenal, and it's a good time going into Christmas like this.\"\n\nManchester City's Erling Haaland has scored 19 Premier League goals this season; it's the joint-most by a player in a campaign before Christmas along with Andy Cole (1993-94), Kevin Phillips (1999-00) and Luis Suárez (2013-14).\n\nManchester City are just the third side in Premier League history to score 3+ goals in six successive wins against a side, after Arsenal against Sunderland in October 2007 and Manchester United against Nottingham Forest in December 2022.",

    "fullText": "Leeds United return to Elland Road on Saturday night, aiming to extend their Premier League unbeaten run to four matches as they welcome Crystal Palace to West Yorkshire.\n\nLeeds came from behind to secure a deserved 1-1 draw away at Brentford last weekend, continuing their recent upturn under Daniel Farke.\n\nThat point followed impressive performances against behemoths, and Leeds now sit 17th in the table.\n\nThey are three points clear of the relegation zone, with momentum in their favour.\n\nHowever, Farke knows his Leeds team will have to bring their A-game against this tricky Palace side in pursuit of European football.\n\nLeeds have enjoyed a revival since Farke’s switch to a 3-5-2 system, which has somehow made them more fluid and confident in the final third.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has been the chief beneficiary, scoring in four consecutive Premier League matches, the joint-longest active run in Europe’s top five leagues.\n\nLeeds have scored as many goals in their last five games as they managed in their previous 11 combined.\n\nElland Road has also become a more open, chaotic arena of late.\n\nLeeds have scored and conceded in each of their last six home league games, with end-to-end football becoming the norm.\n\nMeanwhile, Crystal Palace arrive fresh from a bruising 3-0 home defeat to Manchester City, a scoreline that flattered, given the Eagles generated enough chances to win.\n\nWastefulness proved costly, and Oliver Glasner’s side now face another quick turnaround following Thursday night’s Conference League draw with KuPS.\n\nPalace remain fifth in the table, just two points off the top four, but their domestic form immediately after European fixtures has been a recurring concern.\n\nLeeds have taken five points from their last three league games, a run that included Chelsea, Liverpool, and Brentford.\n\nOn the other hand, Palace have failed to win any of their five league matches played directly after a Conference League fixture this season (D1, L4).\n\nHowever, Palace will take solace from their record against Leeds, having beaten the hosts in their last two league meetings.\n\nThe Eagles haven’t lost to Leeds since 2021.\n\nThe Whites and the Eagles have faced off 52 times, with Leeds winning 24 and drawing 13 of those matches, dating back to a League Cup encounter in 1962.\n\nCrystal Palace have won 10 league games on the road in 2025, the highest number of any Premier League club.\n\nBut Leeds’ home form will inspire confidence, having collected three-quarters of their Premier League points tally at Elland Road, 12 of 16.\n\nLeeds will have to work to break Palace, though. Only league leaders Arsenal (10) have conceded fewer league goals than the Eagles (15) this season.\n\nThe home team will again be without the ‘excellent’ Lukas Nmecha, who has been ruled out with a hamstring issue despite fans hoping for a return.\n\nSean Longstaff and Daniel James also remain sidelined, leaving Farke with an unchanged pool of options.\n\nWith Nmecha unavailable, Noah Okafor is expected to continue alongside Calvert-Lewin in attack, despite missing chances at Brentford.\n\nItalian international Wilfried Gnonto (13 caps) is likely to remain among the substitutes, as the current system favours wing-backs over traditional wingers.\n\nThe midfield trio of Anton Stach, Ethan Ampadu, and Ao Tanaka should be retained, while Jayden Bogle and Gabriel Gudmundsson continue in the wing-back roles.\n\nThe back three of Pascal Struijk, Jaka Bijol, and Joe Rodon is also set to remain intact in front of Lucas Perri.\n\nCrystal Palace are stretched defensively. Daichi Kamada, Daniel Munoz, Cheick Doucoure, Chadi Riad, Rio Cardines, and Caleb Kporha are all unavailable.\n\nIsmaila Sarr is away on Africa Cup of Nations duty.\n\nLucas Perri; Joe Rodon, Jaka Bijol, Pascal Struijk; Jayden Bogle, Anton Stach, Ethan Ampadu, Ao Tanaka, Gabriel Gudmundsson; Noah Okafor, Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",

You don't become a bad coach in four months.\n\n\"You are working tirelessly and you are fully committed. It's what you I am an emotional person and I wear my heart in my sleeve.\n\n\"To get the team to this position in the Premier League and see it change so quickly is hurtful.

This is the process we are doing. Now it is Manchester United.\"\n\nEmery conjured a victory against United at Villa Park in his first match in charge but that remains the only time Villa have beaten the Red Devils at home in the Premier League since 1995.\n\nThomas Frank admitted there was no \"quick fix\" at Tottenham after their painful 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest last week.\n\nBut how patient will the Spurs hierarchy be after just four wins in their past 14 games in all competitions.\n\nFans endured a terrible Premier League campaign under Ange Postecoglou last season, when the club finished 17th, but at least they were entertained and ultimately celebrated Europa League glory.\n\nThere has been little tangible progress under former Brentford boss Frank, whose 11th-placed team are hosting champions Liverpool.\n\nAfter 16 league games in 2024/25, Postecoglou's team had scored 11 more goals and conceded two fewer than Frank's side.\n\nStrikingly, only Everton, Sunderland and Wolves have had fewer shots on target than Tottenham, even though they reinforced their attack in the summer transfer window, bringing in Mohammed Kudus, Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nFrank is confident he will get the time to turn things around but the clock is ticking.\n\nSaturday (1500 GMT unless stated)\n\nNewcastle v Chelsea (1230), Bournemouth v Burnley, Brighton v Sunderland, Manchester City v West Ham, Wolves v Brentford, Tottenham v Liverpool (1730), Everton v Arsenal, Leeds v Crystal Palace (both 2000)\n\nAston Villa v Manchester United",

    "fullText": "Dan Ballard says Granit Xhaka's arrival raised the standards at Sunderland to help them compete in the top half of the Premier League.\n\nSwitzerland midfielder Xhaka was one of several summer signings following the club's promotion from the Championship through the play-offs.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who joined from Bayer Leverkusen, was installed as captain, and his leadership has had a clear impact on a side that has settled right back into life in the top flight.\n\nSunderland are currently eighth in the table - just two points off the top four - following their 1-0 derby win against Newcastle on Sunday.\n\nBallard, who was in Arsenal's academy when Xhaka was at the Gunners, told Football Focus: \"He's an amazing guy.\n\n\"I was a bit surprised when we signed him. I wasn't sure what it'd be like. I didn't think one person could affect the team the way he's done.\n\n\"From minute one, I think the standards really rose because he does everything to 100%.\n\n\"It's kind of like, well if he's got that amazing career and he's still doing everything perfectly, why wouldn't we? And I think it just sort of lifted the standards.\"\n\nSunderland have won seven and lost just four of their 16 league games, and Ballard attributed Xhaka's influence to that winning mentality.\n\n\"I mean literally everything, from the work in the gym to the standards, he puts out on the training pitch,\" added the centre-back, 26.\n\n\"You know we've just been outside, it can be cold and wet and but he's 100% focused and giving everything in training.\n\n\"So when some of us boys may be not putting that work in and you see him doing it, it's unacceptable for us.\n\n\"If he's doing it, he's won titles and played hundreds of games in the Premier League. Then why shouldn't we? It's lifted everyone.\"",

    "fullText": "Opta statistics released by OptaJoe this week reveal that Jurrien Timber has the lowest dribbled-past percentage for full-backs in the Premier League this season, based on a minimum of 30 true tackle attempts.\n\nTimber has made 57 attempted tackles, with only five players getting past him, putting him at a 91% success rate.\n\nThe nearest player is Reinildo Mandava of Sunderland, who has been dribbled past four times from 38 attempts for an 89% success rate, followed by Michael Kayode (six from 46).\n\nRiccardo Calafiori rounds out the top four, with only six of 45 dribble attempts against the Arsenal left-back proving successful.\n\nThe Gunners’ starting full-backs both featuring in the top four in the league is likely a big factor in the club’s impressive defensive record this season.\n\nFew would argue that Timber and Calafiori aren’t some of the best full-backs in the division, and the central defensive combination of Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba has been one of the best around for a long time now.\n\nThe concern at the moment is just around how often those four players will actually make it onto the pitch together.\n\nTimber and Calafiori have both had serious injury issues with Arsenal in the past, and both have been dealing with knocks over the last fortnight. To make matters worse, Timber’s backups Ben White and Cristhian Mosquera are both injured, denying him rest opportunities.\n\nThen Saliba has spent some time on the sidelines recently too, and Gabriel remains out of action with an Adductor injury.\n\nIf the quartet can all get fit and stay fit for the second half of the season, Arsenal will have a great chance at winning some trophies.",

    "fullText": "A player of his quality, who gives so many options for Liverpool and only costs £65m would be an absolute bargain.\n\nLet's wait and see what happens because it feels like the entire Premier League also wants to sign him.\n\nBut what people forget about Semenyo is his story. He is the ultimate underdog. When he was a teenager he was rejected by massive clubs, including Arsenal.\n\nHe hadn't really played academy football until he arrived at Bristol City as an 18-year-old. Then he went on loan to the National League and League Two, playing for Bath City and Newport County.\n\nThose loans meant he was able to play for Bristol City's first-team, where he slowly established himself as one of the best young attackers in the Championship, catching Bournemouth's attention in the process.\n\nNow it seems like Bristol City are ready to write another success story. But this time around, their next Semenyo could be from Liverpool.\n\nAccording to Ian Gay a Managing Consultant and Mentor, who is well connected to Bristol City on X, the club has agreed a deal for Ranel Young to join the Championship side.\n\nFootball Insider have also confirmed Bristol City's agreement with Young.\n\nGay mentions how Young is seen as a similar profile to Semenyo.\n\nHe's 19-years-old and spent the majority of his academy career at Liverpool, he even sat on the bench for the first-team two times under Arne Slot but never made an appearance before being released by the club.\n\nYoung has since spent the last few months in Serbia, moving to a second division side in what was a bizarre move.\n\nNow he's back in England and at Bristol he looks like he will be given the pathway to restore his career and make a name for himself.\n\nWhether he can actually follow in the footsteps of Semenyo remains to be seen.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City welcome Brentford to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night in an all-Premier League EFL Cup quarter-final showdown.\n\nMan City booked their place in the last eight with a comfortable 3-1 win over Swansea City.\n\nWhile Premier League and Champions League success usually take centre stage at the Etihad, the EFL Cup still carries significance for Pep Guardiola’s side, given their rich history in the tournament.\n\nMan City have dominated the competition, lifting the trophy six times in eight seasons between 2014 and 2021.\n\nHowever, they have not won it since edging Tottenham Hotspur in the 2021 final and have failed to reach the quarter-finals in recent years.\n\nThat makes tonight’s contest an important marker, especially as Man City have gone on to win the trophy after each of their last six quarter-final victories.\n\nGuardiola has rotated his squad well so far, guiding Man City past Huddersfield Town and Swansea with little fuss. The hosts also head into the game on the back of five wins in a row across all competitions.\n\nMan City clinically dispatched a profligate Crystal Palace side 3-0 in the Premier League and will be confident of extending their winning streak at the expense of another London club.\n\nGuardiola is expected to name a heavily rotated side for tonight’s EFL Cup showdown, with next weekend’s home game against West Ham United in mind.\n\nJames Trafford will likely return to the XI for the first time since the 2-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League.\n\nThere should be changes to the backline, although Nico O’Reilly will likely reprise his role.\n\nWith John Stones struggling with injury, Nathan Ake returns to the XI for the first time in over a month.\n\nAbdulkodir Khusanov should join the out-of-favour centre-back at the heart of defence, while Rico Lewis lines up at right back.\n\nTijjani Reijnders should start at the base of midfield with Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Oscar Bobb, and Bernardo Silva ahead of him.\n\nWith Omar Marmoush jetting off to the Africa Cup of Nations, Erling Braut Haaland should lead the line.",

    "fullText": "PDC World Darts Championship: Glen Durrant - Price can rival the two Lukes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nYou might be forgiven for thinking all the conversation in the run up the PDC World Championship has been about the two Lukes: Littler and Humphries and to a large extent you would be correct. There are other names that some fancy to test the most recent two World Champions.\n\nWhen Darts World talked to Glen Durrant, three-time Lakeside (WDF) champion and winner of the PDC's Premier League, he agreed that at least one other player should be in the mix:\n\nLet's talk about Gerwyn Price - can he keep up with the two Lukes and compete?\n\nHe can absolutely still cut it at the top of the sport. His A game is as good as any player in the world right now. He’s super fit, so fatigue isn’t coming into it. I’d like to see him be 3-0 down in a match and come back to win it 4-3.\n\nIt’s almost like he needs that great match early doors to get his belief back. He had that at the World Matchplay where he seemed to be 5-0 down after the first break, but it’s part of his game now, to know he can come back from the jaws of defeat. The only thing I think Gerwyn Price needs is to show that resilience. He needs to show that grit. But right now, he can be as good as anybody when he is at the top of his game.\n\nTHE PDC WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN FACTS AND FIGURES: Arm yourself on dartsdatabase.co.uk\n\nIs his 11 world ranking representative of how good he is or do you think he should be higher than that?\n\nHe’s at No. 3 in the world in my eyes. I think the two Lukes are just a little bit ahead of him. There are some great players around at the moment. Stephen Bunting looks like he’s just searching for that little bit extra at the moment. James Wade has had an unbelievable season so far. If I had to give you my top 10 right now, Price would definitely be at three.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS! Gerwyn Price wins PDC World Darts Championship\n\nPrice v Littler. If it were to happen, if those guys were to meet in the quarterfinals, would that be one of the best quarterfinals of all time?\n\nI’ve done the draw, done the little league table, the fantasy of how it plays out. I’ve got it down that they will meet in the quarter-finals, that seems like a match-up we can anticipate.\n\nThere have been some epic games at Alexandra Palace. Sometimes as a commentator you get to watch some mouthwatering ties, and I think that this is a tie that would excite the players, but the crowd would love it too. It’s what we want.\n\nI think it’ll happen, I think they are the two standout players in that section, and I think it’s going to be an absolute belter.\n\nGLEN DURRANT WINS PREMIER LEAGUE: Watch Duzza's 2020 Moment of triumph\n\nAs a former player turned pundit Glen also look for value in the betting market and was talking via 10Bet . Does he see one of those fairytale runs that Ally Pally is famous for happening this year:\n\nBack to the PDC World Championships. Who could rattle a few cages?\n\n“I don't really think it's been the year of the underdog with the domination of the two Lukes. I've struggled to get value for people. You know, I'll give you a couple of names here:\n\n“ I think Martin Schindler can go on and run this year. I think Jermaine Wattamina is in the form of his life. I think there's a couple of young players too who could do well like Van Veen and Manby. I'm a big fan of the North American scene. Adam Savada, etc... . But I don't see them going deep because the elite players just look so good.\n\n“Also, I don't see, for example, a Scott Williams reaching the semi-final like a couple of years ago. I think the cream will rise to the top.\n\n\" So looking up and down the draw, I mean, as we said, you think the top eight could potentially be your quarter-final, and there's every reason why we can say that.\n\n“ Everyone's writing off Rob Cross… at 175 to 1. Rob Cross is not a 175 to 1 shot. I hope he finds his form there.\n\n“It's intriguing. It's exciting. It's going to be the place to be. It's what everyone's going to be watching. And if seeds go, then great. But I'd be surprised if we don't see one of those real top elite players picking up that million quid.”\n\nGet \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "fullText": "One former scout says that it’s inevitable that one Chelsea player will depart the club very soon, as things heat up for January.\n\nLeeds United are among a number of Premier League clubs weighing up a move to sign Raheem Sterling.\n\nSterling could join other players such as Tyrique George and Axel Disasi, who are also not really in the plans at Chelsea now or in the near future, in departing the club in the January window. Surely none of them will want to wait until the summer window and miss a whole season of basically not playing any first team football?\n\nWe don’t expect much more to be happening at Chelsea in the January window, however, we will of course always be hearing about yet another teenager that Chelsea are interested in signing and interestingly, there was one today that came out.\n\nAnd there also appears to be a lot of noise about Chelsea’s interest in Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who will surely depart his club in the January window due to not playing hardly at all right now.\n\nRaheem Sterling in action for Arsenal. (Photo by Jan Kruger/Getty Images)\n\naccording to former Man United and Blackburn chief scout Mick Brown, who remains very well-connected within the game, Leeds are keen on Sterling.\n\n“It’s inevitable Sterling will leave Chelsea,” he told Football Insider.\n\n“When was the last time he played for Chelsea? He hasn’t been involved at all this season and he’s not a part of the manager’s plans there.\n\n“So there’s no reason for him to stick around, he needs to get out and start playing again.\n\n“I understand Leeds and other Premier League teams are looking at potentially taking him.\n\n“They’re in need of attacking players, and at his best he would be an improvement on what they’ve got, it’s just a question of whether he is at his best these days.\n\n“He went on loan to Arsenal last season and really struggled, barely played, and the amount of playing time he’s had over the last year is a major concern.\n\n“If his legs have gone and it’s something were he’s declined physically, then he will struggle wherever he goes, and I hope that isn’t the case.\n\n“But the clubs will know, they’ll assess what his issues have been, and then decide whether to take the gamble on him because he’s still regarded very highly.”",

    "fullText": "Manchester United played out a hugely entertaining 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in their Premier League game at Old Trafford on Monday.\n\nThe hosts should have won, considering they had taken the lead on three separate occasions, but Ruben Amorim’s confusing tweak at the back did not help the team, nor his young defenders.\n\nThe draw means the Red Devils are currently sixth in the league standings, two points off the top four. However, things will get trickier from here on in.\n\nThe head coach will be without his key attacking duo, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo, as both will depart for the Africa Cup of Nations. Noussair Mazraoui has already left, and both Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain sidelined.\n\nAnd in further bad news, Casemiro has also been ruled out of the match against Aston Villa next Sunday as he saw his fifth individual yellow against the Cherries.\n\nHe saw yellow for a foul on Marcus Tavernier in the second-half, who subsequently scored from the resultant free-kick to hand the visitors a 3-2 lead.\n\nFive yellow cards mean an automatic one-game suspension, and the Brazilian missing out against an in-form Villa means Amorim will have a mountain to climb at Villa Park.\n\nThe former Real Madrid superstar scored against the Cherries, and has generally looked much better as compared to last season, partly due to the team playing only once a week.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who the Portuguese tactician turns to in Casemiro’s absence. He does not seem to rate Kobbie Mainoo in a deeper role, and he has openly criticised Manuel Ugarte this season.\n\nThe Uruguayan has started three times in the league this season, and in all three occasions, the 20-time English league champions have come out on the losing side. He also has been linked with a January exit.\n\nWith Unai Emery’s side winning each of their last six games, Amorim will be hoping for an inspired showing from his available players.\n\nAfter his encouraging cameo, fans will be hoping Mainoo gets the nod in place of Casemiro.\n\nFeature image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nBernd Leno (Fulham): Excellent for Fulham in their 3-2 win at Burnley. I know the result looks like a close game and Fulham will say they deserved to win, but Bernd Leno made five or six good saves at the start of the game that kept them in it. Burnley will feel hard done by.\n\nMalo Gusto (Chelsea): I'm not the biggest lover of this fella if I'm being honest. I can't work out why I don't rate him but I just don't. But credit where credit is due - he scored a good goal and played well against Everton - who were poor. He seems to be stepping up. A goal and an assist. I have to be as fair as I can.\n\nNordi Mukiele (Sunderland): He was excellent in the win over Newcastle. He got a yellow card but shut down Anthony Gordon, one of the best wingers in the Premier League who will probably start for England at the World Cup, and Mukiele didn't allow him to get anything going. He handled the mental appoach to it fantastically. He got the crowd involved and was part of a monumental victory for Sunderland.\n\nCalvin Bassey (Fulham): He chipped in with a goal at Burnley and might be my favourite personality in football - happy-go-lucky, plays with his heart on his sleeve. He's going to make mistakes but doesn't try to be perfect or polished and it was another dominant display by him. It looks like he's at fault for the first goal but it's actually Antonee Robinson running out to the left for no good reason.\n\nIbrahima Konate (Liverpool): Konate was under a lot of pressure and people were questioning whether he's going to be at Liverpool long-term - whether he's letting the transfer saga get to his head. He stepped up again in the win against Brighton and delivered.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): I'm seeing a lot of talk about the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth being the best game we've seen all year. Amateur-hour defending. But quality with the corner for Casemiro's goal and then that free-kick - you get in team of the week if you spank one of them in the top bin. He deserves that.\n\nIbrahim Sangare (Nottingham Forest): I was struggling to put Forest players in, which is weird when they won 3-0, but I thought Spurs were that bad. So bad you couldn't turn around and say 'these were great players'. But Sangare with a goal and two assists has had a great day for a holding midfielder. He's thriving under Sean Dyche. They lose him now for the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, which is really disappointing.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi (Nottingham Forest): He's got all the ability and potential to be whatever he wants. We need to see more games like this - goals and assists. I thought he was excellent on the day and Spurs couldn't live with him - he ran them ragged.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): The most underrated striker in the Premier League. Two goals in back-to-back games. The kid scores. He comes off after 70 minutes for Alexander Isak. Fantastic signing. He will be pushing Erling Haaland all the way for most goals. This kid is mustard - he's the real deal. Another one who will be looking at the World Cup and thinking he's got to go - he can play off the left-hand side with Kylian Mbappe for France.\n\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa): Villa are going about their business now. They showed West Ham too many opportunities - they won 3-2 away but on another day they lose. Rogers, fantastic first goal. The calmness and poise to turn and swivel on it. The second, knuckleball. You can try that 10 times and it won't go there, right in the top corner. Making a real argument that he should be starting for England in the opening game of the World Cup. He's growing as a player and a leader. It's no coincidence Villa do well when this kid does well.\n\nHarry Wilson (Fulham): Just a player you really enjoy watching. He has no real super strength but got two assists and a goal at Burnley. So calm, so poised. Not the quickest but he'll go past you, and knows he'll go on the left foot but you can't stop him. Wonderful football player.\n\nArne Slot (Liverpool): A massive result against Brighton. It was all about how he handled the Mohamed Salah situation. A lot of pressure on him and Liverpool. He defused the situation perfectly. They got the clean sheet, got the win. Also he managed that Joe Gomez situation - another injury at right-back. Pivotal win for them, and when you look at the table they're seventh. Considering their bad start to the season they're a few points off the Champions League places. They'll feel happy.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "A remarkable, chaotic, mesmerising Premier League thriller at Old Trafford captured the imagination even of the clinical operators in the dugout.\n\n\"Really difficult to explain,\" said Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola. \"But I prefer 4-4 to 0-0.\"\n\n\"Fun,\" was Manchester United counterpart Ruben Amorim's initial observation.\n\nAnalysing for Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher went further.\n\n\"The best game of the Premier League season so far,\" said the former England and Liverpool defender. \"It was almost a throwback to Alex Ferguson's Manchester United with attacking football.\n\n\"It is the best I have seen Man Utd. For the majority of the game, they were absolutely fantastic.\n\n\"For the first time under Amorim - and first time in a long time - I felt like I was watching what Man Utd are supposed to be. Wave after wave attack, but the inability to defend has hurt them.\"\n\nFor the record, Ferguson took charge of two games when United scored four and didn't win.\n\nThe first was a significant factor in his side's failure to win the 2012 title as United threw away a 4-2 lead and drew 4-4 with Everton at Old Trafford.\n\nThe other was Ferguson's very last match, an extraordinary 5-5 draw at West Brom in 2013.\n\nAmorim has a very long road ahead before he can be compared to Ferguson.\n\nBut at least, on a night when his side led twice in the first half, then fought back to get their noses in front again after conceding two in a matter of minutes at the start of the second, and finally had to settle for a point as Bournemouth finished the stronger, he understood what everyone had witnessed.\n\nIn a vibrant first half, the hosts' had the highest non-penalty xG value (2.49), most shots (17) and joint-most touches in the opposition's box (30) of any side in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League match this season.\n\n\"If you understand a little bit,\" Amorim said. \"If you follow the club like I follow the Premier League for so long, you [know you] have not just the duty to try to win the games. The way you try to win the games is so important for the fans.\n\n\"Of course they are desperate to win, but also, I feel that they are desperate to be inspired when they come to Old Trafford.\n\n\"Today was inspiring, I think, also because of Bournemouth. But in the end that's the feeling of frustration of not winning the game.\"",

    "fullText": "\"When you get a certain narrative around you and are tarred with a certain brush, it's quite hard to shake it.\"\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin delivered those words after Leeds came from behind to take a point off Brentford on Sunday. Having been the player to score the equaliser he was able to reflect on how he has managed to change opinions.\n\nBefore the last international break, he had only scored one goal for his new club Leeds United.\n\nThe knives were out and plenty of Leeds supporters may have been fearing a repeat of the 28-year-old's final season for Everton, in which he scored just three goals in an injury-hit campaign.\n\nBut since the Premier League returned in mid-November the Englishman has been on a mission, netting four goals in five games, including strikes in each of his past four matches.\n\nHis latest goal was a perfectly timed header into the far corner to rescue a draw for Leeds at Brentford and take his side three points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nAfter scoring for the 62nd time in the Premier League on Sunday, Calvert-Lewin told Sky Sports: \"I'm feeling good. I think the performances are speaking for themselves at the moment,\n\n\"For me, it was always about being mentally tough and hanging in there at certain points and step-by-step, day-by-day putting performances together and all of a sudden the tide starts to turn and you start scoring goals. That is the life of a centre forward.\n\n\"In football, as a player you have to control the controllables and the moment you start letting the external stuff bother you that's when you can get yourself in a rut. I keep my circle small, my wife, my daughter and my dad. That keeps me grounded.\"",

    "fullText": "Manchester United welcome Bournemouth to Old Trafford on Monday night. They are aiming to build on their impressive victory at Molineux and continue their ascent up the Premier League table.\n\nRuben Amorim’s side appear to have turned a corner recently. They have lost just one of their last nine Premier League games. Furthermore, they have collected more points in this period than in their previous 17 matches combined. The Red Devils arrive in high spirits after thrashing Wolves 4-1 last weekend. However, they face a Bournemouth side currently enduring a slump.\n\nThe Cherries are winless in their last six league matches. This is their longest such streak since early 2024. Despite their recent struggles, Andoni Iraola’s men have a formidable recent record at the Theatre of Dreams. They have won their last two away games against United by a 3-0 scoreline on both occasions.\n\nVenue: Old Trafford, Manchester\n\nLast Meeting: Manchester United 4-1 Bournemouth, 31 July 2025, Premier League Summer Series\n\nRuben Amorim confirmed that defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain sidelined with injuries. Furthermore, striker Benjamin Šeško is a major doubt due to food poisoning and will be assessed late. With defensive options limited, the manager may be forced to shuffle his backline. However, Amad Diallo, Noussair Mazraoui, and Bryan Mbeumo are expected to be available before departing for the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nAndoni Iraola faces a midfield selection headache. Lewis Cook serves the second game of his three-match suspension for a red card against Sunderland. Additionally, Ryan Christie and Ben Doak remain sidelined. Defensively, Marcos Senesi is a doubt after suffering cramps against Chelsea. However, the defender is optimistic about featuring. Young defender Veljko Milosavljevic is out for a couple of months with a knee injury.\n\nUnited’s recent resurgence has seen them climb the table. However, defensive fragility remains an issue. They have kept just one clean sheet in 15 Premier League games this season. Under Amorim, the team has recorded a clean sheet ratio of just 14.3%. Conversely, their attack is firing. Bruno Fernandes has been involved in eight goals in his last eight games.\n\nThe Cherries have hit a wall offensively. They have failed to score in their last two Premier League games. In fact, they managed just 18 shots in those goalless draws. Historically, this fixture has been tricky for United recently. They are winless in their last four meetings with Bournemouth. If Bournemouth win, they would become the first side ever to win three consecutive top-flight away games against Manchester United while scoring three or more goals each time.\n\nManchester United predicted XI: Lammens; Mazraoui, Heaven, Shaw; Diallo, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dalot; Mbeumo, Mount; Cunha\n\nBournemouth predicted XI: Petrović; Smith, Diakité, Senesi, Truffert; Adams, Scott; Brooks, Tavernier, Semenyo; Evanilson\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League. Coverage starts at 18:30 GMT.\n\nRead- Premier League Team of the Weekend: Ekitike, Rogers, Wilson\n\nSee more- Sunderland boss celebrates ‘special’ derby win over Newcastle\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are apparently leading the race to sign a Premier League player according to an exclusive report over the weekend.\n\nHowever, said player may well have his eyes elsewhere, which then makes me wonder, how can Chelsea be leading the race to sign him if he wants to go elsewhere?\n\nEither way, Chelsea are certainly one of the many clubs who have been looking at signing Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United.\n\nThe midfielder looks set to leave the his club very soon, and you wouldn’t bet against a move happening in the January transfer window due to the fact that Mainoo is just not being picked for United right now and will be in search of further minutes to go off and play for the rest of this season.\n\nI actually think for that reason that this would pretty much rule Chelsea out, because Mainoo isn’t going to be a starter in our midfield right now, is he?\n\nKobbie Mainoo warms up for Manchester United. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough at least 12 clubs are reportedly in the race, sources close to the situation have informed CaughtOffside that Chelsea and Bayern Munich are “leading the chase”. However, the player’s personal preference list still places Napoli as the frontrunner. Mainoo is prioritising where he can be a guaranteed starter as he plots his next move.\n\nThe end of this report is probably all you need to read about it. If Mainoo wants to go somewhere he can be a regular starter, then he isn’t going to chose Chelsea is he?\n\nUnless Chelsea got some big injuries to Enzo Fernandez and/or Moises Caicedo, then Mainoo is never starting ahead of them two. Then you have the likes of Andrey Santos who is even not getting much game time himself, waiting in the wings. Cole Palmer is back and will be playing in midfield too. There’s just no chance of regular game time there for Mainoo.",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola claimed Manchester City had made a \"big statement\" in the Premier League title race with their 3-0 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nGuardiola's side struggled to impose themselves for long spells at Selhurst Park but Erling Haaland's header late in the first half finally broke the deadlock.\n\nAfter riding their luck thanks to several missed Palace chances before and after Haaland's opener, City showed a ruthless streak to kill off the Eagles.\n\nPhil Foden drilled home from the edge of the area before Haaland added a late third from the penalty spot.\n\nSecond-placed City have now won four in a row in the league and sit just two points behind leaders Arsenal as the title race heats up.\n\nGuardiola was especially impressed with the way City dug deep to subdue tenacious Palace just days after their draining 2-1 win at Real Madrid in the Champions League.\n\n\"Always when you approach the game, whoever the opponent, on your terms, good things are going to happen. There's no sense to playing football without being who you are as an individual,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"Still we are not at the top, but we are learning. We will be closer in the future. After playing in the Bernabeu, then we prepared to play the FA Cup winners.\"\n\nIt was a sweet victory for Guardiola after he was out-witted by Palace boss Oliver Glasner in last season's shock FA Cup final defeat at Wembley.\n\nPalace have been a thorn in the side of champions Liverpool, beating them three times this season, and Guardiola acknowledged the threat posed by the south Londoners.\n\n\"It's behind a lot of work. Palace are so strong. Every time we play them it's so difficult,\" he said.\n\nGuardiola conceded City are still a work in progress following his expensive overhaul of the squad since last season.\n\nBut he took heart from their willingness to fight for the win over Palace -- a vital characteristic they lacked throughout last season.\n\n\"Many things we have to improve. Madrid gave me a lot of things, that still we are not ready, not in mentality but in how to approach certain games. They are young some of the players. But 3-0 here is a big statement for us,\" he said.\n\n\"When you win in the past, you believe the past was perfect, always brilliant, always the red carpet. When we won with 100 points, all the things we achieved, we had a lot of games like today. The resilience was part of that.\n\n\"There are moments that you struggle. Madrid was not the perfect game, but it was a step. We fought unbelievably to achieve that.\n\n\"We are in a better position than last season. We are close in the competitions we are in,\" Guardiola added.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City thumped Crystal Palace 3-0 on Sunday to move back to within two points of Premier League leaders Arsenal as Aston Villa kept up their surprise title charge.\n\nElsewhere, Nottingham Forest demolished struggling Tottenham 3-0, while Sunderland saw off local rivals Newcastle 1-0 thanks to a Nick Woltemade own goal.\n\nArsenal, who have set the pace this season, squeaked home on Saturday with a 2-1 win against bottom-club Wolves, thanks to two own goals.\n\nThat put the pressure back on City, who have been showing ominous signs that they are finding their feet in recent weeks.\n\nPep Guardiola's men braced for a tough task at Selhurst Park against high-flying Palace and had to withstand pressure from the home side.\n\nBut they were clinical, with two goals from the ruthless Erling Haaland and one from Phil Foden.\n\n\"It is a really tough place to come,\" City boss Guardiola told Sky Sports. \"When you lose the ball, they attack incredibly well but we were patient.\n\n\"We were lucky when they hit the post from (Adam) Wharton but really pleased for the performance and victory to grow our mentality.\"\n\nHe added: \"Erling is a forward to score the goals but in the second half he keeps the ball. He was able to contain situations. He helped us be together. In the second half he was outstanding.\"\n\nOliver Glasner's Palace, who beat City in last season's FA Cup final, squandered their chances in the first half, with Yeremy Pino hitting the bar when he had only goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to beat.\n\nHaaland was a largely peripheral figure but came alive shortly before half-time, heading a pinpoint Matheus Nunes cross across Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson to give City the lead.\n\nPalace again started the second half brightly and Wharton cracked a low drive against the base of the post.\n\nBut they paid the price for their wayward finishing when Foden drilled expertly into the bottom corner after a powerful run from Rayan Cherki to double the visitors' lead.\n\nCity added gloss to the scoreline when Haaland thundered a penalty past Henderson after Savinho was taken down by the goalkeeper following a surging run late in the game.\n\nVilla started their match at the London Stadium as the form team in the league, with nine wins in 10 matches.\n\nThe visitors fell behind twice, to Mateus Fernandes' goal after just 29 seconds and a poacher's strike from Jarrod Bowen.\n\nBut a Konstantinos Mavropanos own goal cancelled out the opener and Morgan Rogers hauled Villa level at 2-2, before the England midfielder capped a sparkling performance with a stunning shot from outside the box.\n\nThe victory leaves Unai Emery's men just three points behind Arsenal, while West Ham remain stuck in the relegation zone.\n\nIt is an astonishing turnaround for Villa, who did not score a single Premier League goal in their first four matches of the season.\n\nTwo goals from Callum Hudson-Odoi and a screamer from Ibrahim Sangare gave Forest a comfortable victory over troubled Spurs and lifted Sean Dyche's Forest five points above the drop zone.\n\nUnder-fire Tottenham manager Thomas Frank insisted he would be given time to solve their issues.\n\n\"I can't see why not. I think it's pretty evident that if no one gets the time, no one can turn this around. This is not a quick fix,\" he said.\n\nNewcastle are languishing in 12th place in the table after sinking to a 1-0 defeat at the home of local rivals Sunderland, courtesy of Woltemade's blunder in the opening minutes of the second half.\n\nThe two teams were facing each other for the first time in the Premier League for nearly a decade after the Black Cats' recent return to the top division.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin extended his hot streak as Leeds rescued a 1-1 draw at Brentford.\n\nJordan Henderson bagged his first goal for Brentford in the 70th minute, but Calvert-Lewin notched his fourth goal in his last four games with an 82nd minute header.\n\nLeeds sit three points above the relegation zone, while Brentford are seven points ahead of the bottom three.",

    "fullText": "Premier League top goal scorers 2025/2026: Updated Golden Boot rankings as Haaland extends lead originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nErling Haaland is leading the way in the Premier League Golden Boot race.\n\nMohamed Salah equaled the Premier League record for goal contributions in a single season last campaign, scoring 29 goals to win the Golden Boot while pairing it with 18 assists to put himself in contention for the Ballon d'Or.\n\nHowever, he already appears out of the running after Haaland once again reached double figures in quick time. He moved to 14 with a goal in City's 3-1 win over Liverpool on November 9, even though he missed a penalty earlier in the contest.\n\nBrentford's Igor Thiago has established himself as Haaland's main challenger. Igor's five goals in four matches in November saw him named Premier League Player of the Month.\n\nHaaland's brace in a 3-0 win at Crystal Palace on December 14 took him to 17 for the season. Phil Foden continued his fine run of form at Selhurst Park and is one of a cluster of players on seven goals. Another is Hugo Ekitike, whose double helped Liverpool to a much-needed 2-0 win over Brighton earlier in the weekend.\n\nThe Sporting News details the chase for the Premier League top goal-scorer award, which will be a heated battle throughout the 2025/26 season.\n\nMORE:All the latest EPL club news | Latest Premier League scores and schedule | Premier League standings\n\nTable updated after games on Sunday, December 14\n\nAssists serve as the first tiebreaker for the Premier League top scorer, followed by a lower minutes-per-goal value.\n\nMORE: Premier League's all-time top scorers\n\nBelow are the top scorers in each season of the Premier League era (since 1992-93).\n\nAndrew Cole and Alan Shearer saw their record for most goals in a Premier League season shattered by Erling Haaland in 2022/23.\n\nThierry Henry finished atop the Premier League scoring chart in four different seasons, more than any player all-time until Mohamed Salah equaled his mark in 2024/25. Shearer and Harry Kane follow with three scoring titles each.\n\nMORE: Premier League all-time top scorers\n\nLiverpool star Mohamed Salah ran away with the 2024/25 Premier League Golden Boot award, equaling the league record for most goal contributions in a season. The Egyptian scored 29 goals and assisted 18 more for a combined 47 total contributions.\n\nNewcastle striker Isak burst onto the scene by finishing second with 23 goals, while ever-present Haaland was third with 22. Mbeumo and Cunha both secured moves to Manchester United in the ensuing summer by finishing in the top 10, while Chris Wood helped Nottingham Forest qualify for Europe with a sensational season of his own.\n\nErling Haaland secured his second consecutive Premier League Golden Boot in 2023/24 with 27 goals, despite a mid-season injury. He led Manchester City to another title, finishing five goals ahead of Chelsea's Cole Palmer, who surged with a record-breaking hat-trick.\n\nIsak placed third with 21 goals. Haaland scored against all 22 league opponents and capped City's title with a double against Tottenham.\n\nErling Haaland won the 2022/23 Premier League Golden Boot with a new Premier League single-season record of 36 goals.\n\nThe City striker had built an insurmountable lead over Harry Kane (30 goals), who previously won the Golden Boot three times. Brentford's Ivan Toney was the other to hit the 20-goal mark, while the previous season's joint-top scorer Salah slowly rose up the ranks to fourth.\n\nIt came down to the final day of the 2021/22 season between Tottenham's Son Heung-min and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.\n\nSon's two goals at Norwich City on the final day allowed him to momentarily move ahead of Salah in the scoring table. But the Liverpool star came off the bench and netted late to catch Son, as the two stars shared the Golden Boot on 23 goals.\n\nMORE:Full Premier League goalscoring leaders & statistics from 2021/22 season",
