    "fullText": "As we head into another round of Premier League matches, attention turns to the players who can make the biggest impact.\n\nCaptaincy remains one of the most important decisions each week, and GW16 brings several exciting options to consider.\n\nPlenty of managers stick with the same trusted choices week after week, but this game week offers room for a wider mix. From the premium stars to reliable mid-priced players and a few bold picks, some options could deliver strong returns.\n\nWith so many possibilities, it’s worth taking a closer look at the leading captain options for GW16 and why they could make a real difference for your team.\n\nBukayo Saka is a strong captain option this week as Arsenal, who lead the Premier League with 33 points, take on a struggling Wolves side sitting at the bottom with just 2 points.\n\nHe has been in good form this season, scoring 4 goals and providing 1 assist. He also has a history of performing well against Wolves, having both scored and assisted in their last league meeting.\n\nWith this favorable fixture and his ability to create and finish chances, Saka looks set to deliver the attacking returns that make him a reliable choice for captaincy.\n\nFor managers looking for a player who can make a real impact, he stands out as one of the top options this game week.\n\nCalvin Bassey has been one of Fulham’s most consistent defenders this season. He has demonstrated strong defensive skills, making key interceptions and contributing to his team’s clean sheets on several occasions.\n\nEven though Fulham have struggled for a while now, they face a Burnley side that has had a difficult season, giving Bassey a good chance to keep another clean sheet.\n\nHis reliability at the back makes him a solid budget-friendly option who can still deliver points for managers.\n\nIgor Thiago has been one of Brentford’s most dangerous attacking players this season, scoring 11 goals, most of which have come from penalties.\n\nThis week, he faces Leeds United, who sit 16th in the Premier League, providing him with a favorable chance to add to his tally.\n\nWith his eye for goal and ability to take responsibility in crucial moments, Thiago could be an exciting option for managers considering the captain armband in GW16.\n\nDespite being blank in Manchester City’s 3‑0 win against Sunderland on Matchday 14, Haaland is still one of the most reliable FPL options and continues to be the captain pick for many managers each week.\n\nHis ability to score goals and make an impact on games makes him a top choice.\n\nThis week, Manchester City face Crystal Palace, who sit 4th in the table and are in good form.\n\nWith another favorable fixture, Haaland looks set to be a leading option for the captain’s armband in GW16, as he is always dangerous in attacking areas and can change a game with a single moment.\n\nOllie Watkins is showing signs of a strong comeback after a slow start to the season.\n\nWest Ham face an in-form Aston Villa, who have been unbeaten in most of their recent matches, and Watkins is likely to have plenty of chances to score or assist.\n\nWith his ability to influence the game in attack, he could also be considered as a captain option for GW16\n\nBryan Mbeumo could be an interesting captain pick this week. Bournemouth have struggled to defend set-pieces and have allowed the fourth-most shots from their left side this season, which gives Mbeumo a good chance to get involved in attack.\n\nWith Matheus Cunha back, Amad can return to the right, where he has a strong connection with Mbeumo. This link-up and the favorable fixture make him a solid option to score or assist in GW16.\n\nWho are you giving your captain armband to this week heading into Game Week 16? Will you go with a popular pick or try a differential option? Share your thoughts and let us know who will wear the armband in your team.",

    "fullText": "Premier League legend Thierry Henry has backed Enzo Maresca and believes Chelsea don’t have enough quality in their squad.\n\nChelsea are now winless in four games having lost 2-1 against Atalanta in the Champions League on Tuesday night in another poor showing.\n\nThe Blues face a crucial game on Saturday against an inform Everton side at Stamford Bridge, and Maresca really can’t afford to drop points.\n\nMaresca has come under fire for Chelsea’s poor run of form, and fans were particularly annoyed with his in game management against Atalanta.\n\nChelsea ended the game with six defenders on the pitch, whilst Estevao and Andrey Santos remained on the bench.\n\nMaresca came under pressure earlier in the season following back to back defeats against Manchester United and Brighton.\n\nMaresca is under pressure following a poor run of results. (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nHe managed to turn things around, and now needs to do the same again, but he’s got the backing of Arsenal legend Henry.\n\n“You see them dominate games against sides like Barcelona, Arsenal, PSG but against teams like this, Chelsea struggle, why? he told CBS Sports Golazo.\n\n“Well, They don’t have the weapons to break open teams like this without Cole Palmer,\n\n“They are winless in the last four games, but can you blame the manager? I don’t think so.\n\n“I don’t think any of their attackers are on Cole Palmer’s level which should tell you the level they all still are.\n\n“Some of their players also look fatigued and maybe they need rest. I think in January they need to address their centre back crisis.”\n\nMaresca is believed to retain the full backing of the Chelsea board, and it’s been reported they feel the Italian is the right man to lead the project forward.\n\n“Should tell you the level” – Thierry Henry backs Enzo Maresca for one reason despite poor form\n\nChelsea backup player desperate to play with World Cup place now under threat\n\nChelsea players have meeting regarding recent struggles against lesser team\n\nChelsea are set to review Maresca at the end of the current season, where once again the target is said to be Champions League football.\n\nInternally the Blues don’t expect to be in a position to lift the Premier League title in May, but fans will want to see signs of progress and a title challenge as soon as possible.",

    "title": "Luke O’Nien: From League One Losses To His Premier League Debut",
    "description": "Despite having an up and down week or so, Luke O’Nien’s legacy at Sunderland is one that should give many budding footballers inspiration.",
    "fullText": "Look, even though he got stupidly sent off at the weekend, Luke O’Nien has fully cemented his legacy as one of the greatest Sunderland players. I’d even argue that he could receive straight red cards for the rest of his career and still not lose the love of so many supporters.\n\nLuke O’Nien’s Sunderland journey is almost a tale as old as time. Brought to Sunderland in 2018 ahead of the club’s first season in League One, he had quite a rocky start. But O’Nien thrived at Sunderland, winning the 2018/19 Sunderland Young Player of the Year, featured in the 2020/21 EFL League One Team of the Season, and starred in the promotion winning squad of 2021/22.\n\nO’Nien’s real legacy at the club comes from the unhinged antics he gets up to on the pitch. We simply can’t forget the double whammy of February and March 2023 with the piggyback from Bristol City’s Alex Scott and the cheeky kiss gifted to Norwich City’s Jacob Sorensen.\n\nLuke also cemented his status off the pitch through his support for the local community and honesty about his tough adventure in football. This connection with the fans meant that he was awarded ‘Club Captain’ in 2024/25.\n\nRegardless of his new title, the antics didn’t stop there. On 31st August 2024, he scored an own goal which single-headedly ended Sunderland’s 389 minute run without conceding. He tweeted: ‘No celebrations for my third goal of the season, but delighted to be the only man to score past Anthony Patterson this season’. Despite causing us pain, at least he made us laugh along the way.\n\nIn December 2024, O’Nien made club history by shattering the record for the most appearances held at the Stadium of Light.\n\nHe then proceeded to get back up to mischief in February, taking out the linesman and deciding to wave his flag. Luke played 47 times in the Premier League promotion winning season and, despite a nasty injury in the 2nd minute of the Playoff Final, he claims he ‘covered more distance celebrating’ than he did playing.\n\nFast forward to 2025/26 and it’s been a tough few months for Luke. After having brought Sunderland all the way from League One for the last 7 years, it’s been painful for fans to watch him not get any game time due to his injury. However, following him finally being put on the substitute bench against Manchester United in October, O’Nien posted a very emotional statement to his Instagram:\n\n‘From sitting on the floor in non-league to walking out at the Theatre of Dreams, all in just over a decade. I remember sitting on the grass at Wealdstone because the bench was full, waiting for my chance and hoping for a moment to prove myself. Last weekend, after a long layoff, I was sitting on the bench at Old Trafford in the Premier League. It’s funny how life comes full circle’.\n\nThen, at long last, in Gameweek 14’s midweek clash between Sunderland and current title holders Liverpool, away at Anfield, Luke O’Nien finally made his Premier League debut.\n\nHe was substituted on in the 91st minute for goalscorer Talbi and our emotions were laid bare. I won’t confirm nor deny whether I shed a tear or two when he was brought on.\n\nIn an emotional most-match interview, O’Nien told: ‘my wife said my kids were up [and] they were jumping up and down when I came on’. He continued with: ‘to come this far with this incredible club, with the fanbase, I think, for the first time in my Sunderland career, I’m lost for words’.\n\nSo thank you, Mr Sunderland, for staying with us through thick and thin. At least you haven’t been given two straight red cards yet.\n\nLuke’s full post-match Instagram caption can be read below:\n\n“For years, I’ve dreamed about playing in the Premier League. Some people laughed at me. Some coaches I had when I was little said I’d never make it. Lots of people told me I wasn’t good enough and to give up. But I’ve always held on to that dream of playing at the highest level. Deep down I believed that if I just kept working, kept learning, kept showing up every single day, then one day it might happen.\n\n“Last night, that dream that 4 year old me had… came true.\n\n“And if you’d told me I’d make my debut at left wing, up against my mate Mo Salah, I’d have laughed as well. From non-league in 2014, to being released by Watford in 2015… there were moments where it felt like this day might never come.\n\n“Sunderland, you’ve been my home for seven years. I never knew I could fall in love with a club, a city, and its people the way I have. You’ve given me space to grow, to fail, to learn, and to find out who I am as a player and a person. To play even a small part in rebuilding this beautiful club and helping it climb back to where it belongs is something I’ll always be proud of.\n\n“Making my Premier League debut… I’m incredibly grateful. Taking a moment afterwards to stand with my mum and dad and breathe it all in… that was special. But that debut chapter is written now. The focus is on pushing on, improving, growing, and helping drive this club forward with this unbelievable group of players.\n\n“Seven years ago we were in League One. Fast forward to last night and we have a team giving everything, disappointed to only get one point against the Premier League champions. If that’s not a moment to stop, reflect, and feel proud, I don’t know what is.\n\n“Thank you to everyone who’s been part of this journey; my family, my friends, the staff, the supporters, and my teammates.",

    "fullText": "While the focus right now is on tonight’s Champions League game, there is some interesting Premier League news coming out from the weekend just gone.\n\nThe WhoScored team of the week is out, and it features one Blue after their 0-0 draw with Bournemouth – goalkeeper Robert Sanchez.\n\nThe Premier League team of the week for Gameweek 15 as the season approaches the halfway mark.\n\nAs always, having the goalkeeper in the team of the week is always a bit of a backhanded compliment – it means he played well, but you probably deserved to lose.\n\nThat was definitely the case at the Vitality on Saturday. Sanchez was excellent and bailed his team out a few times. The home team had a goal ruled out of a tight offside then had a penalty chalked off moments later for the same reason as they pushed hard.\n\nStill, that’s not on the Spaniard. He’s in the best form of his Chelsea career, and for once he’s not the problem in this team. The increasingly stable and regular Trevoh Chalobah – Wesley Fofana partnership ahead of him is clearly helping him, as is Enzo Maresca’s change of plan in terms of no longer always playing out from the back.\n\nLet’s hope he’s not called into action quite as much tonight as we face Atalanta with 3 vital Champions League points on the line.\n\nJoao Pedro wasn’t ever going to feature in this team – he’s been in dire form of late, and an injury to one of his teammates isn’t going to help matters. His stats compared to Nicolas Jackson make ugly reading.\n\nChelsea’s game tonight is away in Italy, but Enzo Maresca isn’t letting playing 3 in a row away from home be an excuse for his side.",

    "fullText": "It has been 227 days, three managers, two sporting directors, one technical director and 41 goals conceded since Wolves last won in the Premier League.\n\nRooted to the bottom with just two points and 13 away from safety, their top flight future looks bleak as they are already guaranteed to be bottom of the table on Christmas Day.\n\nMonday's 4-1 loss at home to Manchester United was their eighth-straight league defeat, their longest losing top flight run in the Premier League era and equalling their all-time top flight run of defeats from 1981-82.\n\nJean-Ricner Bellegarde's first-half equaliser was just their first league goal since 26 October.\n\nWolves' haul of only two points this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers.\n\nAngry Wolves fans boycotted the opening 15 minutes against United to protest against Fosun's running of the club - they might have wished they stayed outside.\n\n\"I understand the frustration,\" said manager Rob Edwards. \"I won't tell fans what to do.\n\n\"I'd love them to support the players but they have to see effort and commitment in return. Mistakes were punished tonight and that filtered through. There was an anger in the stadium. The lads are trying. The supporters are angry and I get it.\n\n\"It's the toughest league in the world and we came into a team who hadn't won since April. I wasn't anticipating a quick turnaround.\"\n\nRelegation to the Championship is becoming almost an inevitability with Derby County's Premier League low of 11 points under serious threat, so will Wolves avoid becoming the worst team?",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nBart Verbruggen (Brighton): He made four or five really good saves and kept them in the game in the draw against West Ham. On another day West Ham go on to win that. He was bang on it and a big reason why Brighton nicked a draw.\n\nMatty Cash (Aston Villa): Wonderful goal as Aston Villa beat Arsenal and great defending. As a Birmingham fan it pains me to give him credit but he was great and Aston Villa were fantastic. Everyone feels Arsenal are going to run away with the league, but Aston Villa said \"no, not on my watch\".\n\nMarc Guehi (Crystal Palace): He got his team over the line for their win at Fulham and led by example as he always does. He got my mind thinking - not only did he play well this weekend and has been great all season, how much would Liverpool not be in this mess if they had managed to sign him? How good could Liverpool be if they had a proper centre-half like him?\n\nMarco Senesi (Bournemouth): I don't know where Bournemouth keep getting these players from. They sold two centre-halves in the summer and he has just stepped in no problem. He's been absolutely fantastic, and was again as they shut out Chelsea.\n\nBruno Guimaraes (Newcastle): I'm putting Bruno at the base of a diamond in midfield because he is the heart, soul and spirit of Newcastle's team, and was brilliant again against Burnley. He is just a very good football player and there are not many people you can say that about.\n\nAnton Stach (Leeds): He was the player who stood out for Leeds in their draw with Liverpool. The visitors were obviously cruising but I look at players and teams in that moment and look at who is hiding. This guy turned it up - not only a notch but another 10 notches - scored a goal and got an assist.\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Everton): Is he the signing of the season? He has been fantastic. Not only is he scoring, he is pulling the strings and has become the heartbeat of this new-look Everton team under David Moyes, who can get another gear out of these players as they did against Nottingham Forest.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): Top of the diamond is Fernandes. Two goals at Wolves and an assist. His passing was fantastic. He loses a bit of credit because it was against arguably the worst team I have ever seen in Wolves, but he did very well. Manchester United are back on the winning trail.\n\nXavi Simons (Tottenham): He has had a bit of a tough time at Spurs but it felt like this was his moment to show everyone why people think he is so talented. He has pace, power and glides past people. We used to call people like that a luxury but when you put in a match-winning performance like he did against Brentford, you have to start saying he is just good.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Even though he is in a team that is a shambles, he gets in through the middle. He scored two goals against Leeds. I understand Liverpool spent a lot of money on Alexander Isak - and I am a huge fan - but just start this kid. Get the two of them up front and figure it out.\n\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City) My favourite footballer to watch in world football. Not only was his assist for Phil Foden in the win against Sunderland worth the admission fee, he was just delightful. He is like the cult heroes I grew up with and makes me feel like a kid again watching football. Back in the day you had Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Jay-Jay Okocha - a plethora of them. Now there is just Rayan Cherki - and he is fantastic.\n\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): A massive game for Aston Villa. Against Arsenal it was that match where he gets to say: \"Remember me? You got rid of me.\" I think with all that being said, Emery is manager of the week.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your team of the week? Have your say using the comments form below:\n\nWith Liverpool and Mohamed Salah appearing to be moving in different directions - and Salah heading to join his Egypt team-mates for the Africa Cup of Nations next week anyway - the Reds need other players to step up and fill the Salah-shaped hole in the scoring charts. In Hugo Ekitike, they may have found that man.\n\nEkitike is now Liverpool's leading Premier League scorer with five goals, while in all competitions he also tops the charts with eight. On Saturday at Elland Road, the Frenchman scored the first double of his Liverpool career, and with the goals coming in the 48th and 50th minutes, he was the first Premier League player to score twice in the opening five minutes of the second half since Raheem Sterling in March 2019 for Manchester City against Watford.\n\nHe led all players in the match for shots (5), shots on target (3) and touches in the opposition box (9) and his only disappointment must have been the scoreline - he was the first Liverpool player to score two goals in a Premier League and not win since Salah last December in a 3-3 draw with Newcastle.\n\nDespite playing just 398 minutes in the Premier League this season, no player has more assists than Manchester City's Rayan Cherki (5), with two of those coming in the 3-0 victory over Sunderland.\n\nCherki created six chances in open play, the joint most by a player in a Premier League game this season, while at 22 years and 111 days on Saturday he was the second-youngest Manchester City player to achieve that in a Premier League game, older only than - maybe surprisingly - Mario Balotelli in February 2012 against Blackburn Rovers.\n\nAmong players to play 300 minutes in the Premier League, no player has created more chances per 90 minutes than Cherki (3.4) and only four have had more touches in the opposition box per 90 minutes (7.7). The Frenchman is currently assisting a goal, on average, every 80 minutes - also a league best.\n\nBruno Guimaraes has taken 10 corners in the Premier League this season and it is clear which one of those was most memorable - his in-swinging delivery on Saturday against Burnley caught his former team-mate Martin Dubravka out to give the Magpies the lead.\n\nIt was not the first Premier League goal direct from a corner (or 'Olympico goal' as it's known) but it was Newcastle's first ever corner to be put directly into the opponent's goal in the Premier League, to give Guimaraes a slice of Magpies history. Given the term Olympico goal originates from South America, it seems apt that four of the past seven direct corner goals have been scored by players from that continent - all, in fact, from Brazil. Those scorers are Matheus Pereira, Douglas Luiz, Matheus Cunha and Guimaraes.\n\nAside from swinging corners directly into the net, Guimaraes has been in excellent recent form - he now has four goals and two assists across his past nine Premier League appearances, scoring five in total this season. Only in 2023-24 has he ever scored \n\nFollow your Premier League club on BBC Sport\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Manchester United moved into the Premier League top six with their biggest win of the season - but they still have to prove the doubters wrong.",
    "fullText": "In the one step forward, one step back world Manchester United are living in just now, they took a stride in the right direction against Wolves at Molineux.\n\nWhether it is significant or not remains to be seen.\n\nAfter all, the big win at Crystal Palace nine days ago was followed by a dire draw against third-from-bottom West Ham.\n\nBefore that, a three-match winning run was followed by three games without a win, culminating in a home defeat by an Everton side reduced to 10 men after less than 15 minutes.\n\nMonday night's 4-1 drubbing of a hapless Wolves was United's biggest win of the season, equalling a four-goal haul Ruben Amorim's side have not bettered in the Premier League since he came to the club 13 months ago.\n\nUnited had 27 shots, their most in a Premier League game under the Portuguese manager. They have now led in games for longer this season than they did in the entirety of the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nYet Amorim felt compelled to add a caveat, making reference to Wolves' lack of points on the pitch and mutinous atmosphere off it.\n\n\"This is a specific case,\" he said. \"We faced a team that is really, really struggling.\n\n\"You can sense it in every situation of the game.\n\n\"This moment for Wolves is really hard, as a team and as a club. We took advantage of that.\"\n\nIt is why Amorim felt United were in danger of blowing a significant chance to climb into the top six and on the coattails of the sides in contention for Champions League qualification.\n\nNew Wolves boss Rob Edwards felt his side played the way he wanted in the final 15 minutes of the opening period. That included scoring their first goal in 540 minutes through Jean-Ricner Bellegarde.\n\nIt wasn't the script Amorim envisaged. Certainly not one he wanted on a night when Sir Jim Ratcliffe had come to watch and was pictured in animated conversation with director of football Jason Wilcox in the directors' box.\n\nHe told his players this before he left to sit in the visitors' dugout alone with his thoughts before United re-appeared for the start of the second half.\n\n\"We should have finished that half in a different way,\" he said. \"At half-time, they understood we have everything to win the game.\n\n\"If you need to be really distracted, when you look at Everton, that was three points. We could have had two more points against West Ham. Look at the table. Look at the environment. Look at everything.\n\n\"We needed to win the second half. It didn't matter the result.\"\n\nAnalysing the game for Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher praised the performance but said: \"We make the assumption there is a bad result around the corner.\"\n\nHe is not on his own with that opinion. United have still kept only one clean sheet in the Premier League, against Sunderland at Old Trafford on 4 October. Are they on one defeat in nine, or two wins in six?\n\nAfter failing to take opportunities to go second - twice - they are now sixth. If results go their way, they could be fourth once they have played Bournemouth on 15 December. Equally they could be back in the bottom half of the table.\n\nAndoni Iraola's men have taken two points from their past six games but they have won 3-0 on each of their past two visits to Old Trafford.\n\nNothing is for certain at Manchester United these days, it seems, and that includes the availability of their players.\n\nAmorim had thought the Netherlands international Matthijs de Ligt would be available for Monday's game after missing the West Ham match with a minor injury. He was wrong. Now the manager says he can't be sure when De Ligt will be fit.\n\nUnited remain in talks with the respective national associations of Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon, which Amorim said is a \"good sign\" but added he \"doesn't know\" if Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo will be cleared to play against Bournemouth before they leave for Africa Cup of Nations duty.\n\n\"Let's wait for the middle of the week,\" said Amorim.\n\nAsked what moving into sixth place means, he added: \"Nothing. It's always the same feeling. We should have more points. But that's in the past, let's focus on the future.\"",
