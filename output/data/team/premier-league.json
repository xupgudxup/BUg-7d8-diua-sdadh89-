    "fullText": "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has urged his side to use the \"pain\" of a shock 2-2 draw with Wolves when they look to revive their Premier League title challenge against arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe Gunners were on course for a routine win on Wednesday after goals from Bukayo Saka and Piero Hincapie put them 2-0 up at Molineux.\n\nBut bottom of the table Wolves hit back through Hugo Bueno and Tom Edozie.\n\nThe draw left Arsenal, bidding to end a 22-year-wait to be crowned champions of England again, just five points clear of second-placed Manchester City.\n\nIt was the second match in a row where Arsenal had dropped points following a draw with Brentford and meant they have now won just twice in their last seven league games.\n\nCity, who have a game in hand, twice chased Arsenal down to win the Premier League in both the 2022/23 and 2023/24 seasons and their April clash with the Gunners could prove pivotal to the title race.\n\nBut Arteta said: \"I'm going to be the first one to be close with them (the players) because it has nothing to do with attitude or desire, it is completely the opposite.\n\n\"It's part of football. Where it could've gone wrong today, it went wrong.\n\n\"If you look at the way we conceded the two goals today without conceding any other situations, it is very rare but it happens. And it happened for a reason and we need to react.\n\n\"If you are at the top you have to win and win, that's nothing new.\"\n\nArsenal are away to struggling Tottenham in a north London derby on Sunday, with Arteta saying: \"We need to go through the pain and go through it looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now and the next action is Sunday. We need to keep all that in our tummies to show it on Sunday.\"\n\nMeanwhile Saka told Arsenal.com: \"It's pretty flat. We're pretty disappointed with the result, it's the only way to describe it.\n\n\"I think it's a game of two halves. In the first half we started so well but in the second half we dropped the level and got punished for it.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the derby match, the England international added: \"It was already a big game and now it's still a big game...It's still in our control so we just need to focus on that, fix the issues we're having now and get back to winning ways.\"",

    "fullText": "After blowing a two-goal lead to draw against the Premier League's bottom club Wolves, there will be no dodging the questions on whether Arsenal are mentally ready to end their 22-year wait to become champions.\n\nFor the first time really this season, the title race is not completely in the control of Mikel Arteta and his players.\n\nIf Manchester City - five points behind in second place - win all of their remaining 12 games, which includes a home meeting against Arsenal, they will finish first.\n\nThe same, though, can be said for the Gunners, who have 11 matches left - and they win the April encounter at Etihad Stadium.\n\nBut after dropping four crucial points in successive draws against Brentford and Wolves, they are in danger of being haunted by the ghost of past failures.\n\nThree successive runners-up finishes, two of them to Pep Guardiola's men, provide a constant reminder.\n\nFormer Arsenal forward Alan Smith admitted \"that word bottle will be used quite a bit in the next few days\".\n\nThe scenario seemed a lot different when Piero Hincapie slotted home his first goal for the club in the 56th minute, adding to Bukayo Saka's fifth-minute opener.\n\nBut the Gunners lacked the control and ruthlessness to finish off a Wolves side that had lost their nine previous meetings and are heading for the Championship.\n\nThe hosts showed remarkable spirit to fight back with Hugo Bueno's 20-yard curler giving them hope. Then, in the fourth minute of added time, 19-year-old Tom Edozie - off the bench for his senior debut - pounced on a mix-up between Arsenal pair David Raya and Gabriel and his shot went in off Riccardo Calafiori for a dramatic, dreamy leveller.\n\nArsenal next face London derbies with Tottenham and Chelsea and they have worryingly started to wobble at a decisive stage in the season.\n\nArteta knows his side will come under fire and scrutiny.\n\n\"Any opinion you have to take it on the chin,\" he said. \"Any bullet, take it, because we didn't perform at the level required.\n\n\"Anything anyone says can be right because we didn't do what we had to do. The way to do it is on the pitch on Sunday [against Spurs].\"\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards said his side \"knew there is a massive pressure\" on Arsenal at the minute - and they capitalised on that.\n\nThe Gunners have not been performing at their best since the start of 2026 and won only two of their last seven league matches, with victories against Leeds and Sunderland.\n\nArteta added: \"Certain basics we have to do, we did them so poorly, one after the other.\n\n\"It is better not to judge it. We are all too emotional about it. You have to take the hit because we deserve it. It is very easy with emotion to say things that can damage the team. Everyone wants to do their best.\"\n\nOnly Crystal Palace and West Ham (both eight) have dropped more points from winning positions in the league in 2026 than Arsenal (seven) and the Gunners have now failed to win from a leading position in three of their last five league games.\n\nThis was also the first time in Premier League history that a side starting the day bottom of the table avoided defeat to the leaders, despite trailing by two or more goals.\n\n\"It feels like a pivotal moment, a vital one, maybe a turning point,\" Smith added on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's in Manchester City's hands now. With their experience and Guardiola's experience they will really fancy it now. They can almost feel the nerves of the Arsenal team watching that.\n\n\"Having been 2-0 up against the team rock bottom on nine points is just not good enough for the team hoping to win the title. It doesn't bode well for Arsenal to be able to handle the pressure.\"\n\nPressure mounts as Arsenal blow two-goal lead to draw at Wolves\n\nThe result also meant Arsenal failed to win an away league game in which they had a two-goal lead for the first time since April 2023 at West Ham, stretching back 18 matches.\n\nForward Saka, who ended a 15-match goal drought in all competitions, said there was a \"big difference\" with how his side performed in the second half compared to the first.\n\n\"Disappointed, not much else to say,\" added the England international. \"We dropped our standards big time and we got punished for it.\"\n\nJust a day after signing a new five-year deal, he had put his side in front after playing in the No10 role again, but could only watch in dismay at the end having gone off in the 73rd minute after receiving treatment.\n\n\"It's very flat,\" added Saka. \"It's time for us to reflect on the last few performances and fix the issues immediately, so we can get back to winning games, go on a run and build momentum because we've lost that a bit right now.\"\n\n\"I just think we have to get back to our level. Do the basics right and we've got more than enough quality in this team to win games, especially in the games where we've been dropping points in recently. We need to fix that and that's all our focus is right now.\"\n\nWith a north London derby to follow at Tottenham on Sunday, Arsenal have to respond quickly.\n\nSpurs will have Igor Tudor at the helm and they will hope he can give them the 'new manager bounce' to add to the Gunners' misery.\n\nArteta admitted: \"We need to go through the pain, looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now on Sunday.\n\n\"Anything we say from here is fine but we need to keep it all in our tummies and show it on Sunday.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "You do not need to look far to find people proclaiming that VAR works fine outside the Premier League. BBC Sport spoke to people across Europe's top leagues to find out.",
    "fullText": "\"I believe we forgot the reason why VAR was introduced,\" Uefa referees' chief Roberto Rosetti said last week.\n\nHis choice of words was important. This was not a criticism of the Premier League.\n\nIt was aimed across Europe. And it was about the rise of \"microscopic\" video assistant referee interventions.\n\nIn England the media coverage of refereeing is savage. Any perceived mistake is pounced upon.\n\nSocial media is full of people saying VAR works fine elsewhere, that the standard of refereeing is better in other top divisions.\n\nIn the Premier League, are we largely cocooned from much of the controversy in the other top European leagues? BBC Sport spoke to people across the leagues to find out.\n\nBundesliga fans have been relentlessly against VAR from day one.\n\nMany terraces have 'Videobeweis abschaffen' (Eliminate VAR) banners held up in the ultras section for the duration of each review.\n\nFor all the controversy of VAR in the Premier League, it is rare to see this type of big public display. Chants yes, but not banners.\n\nIn Germany it is different. Take Augsburg fans before their fixture against Heidenheim on Sunday.\n\nBehind the goal there was a sea of messages against VAR.\n\n\"Football with VAR is like horse racing with donkeys,\" read one banner, following a penalty they had conceded against Mainz which VAR did not cancel.\n\nBBC Sport has been provided with the most up to date official data from the German top flight.\n\nIt showed that the rate of interventions is higher in Germany, but the frequency of mistakes virtually identical. That is one every 16 games in England, and 15.66 in Germany.\n\nThe numbers are collated internally, with only the Premier League having an independent body to judge performance.\n\nVAR swamps the media coverage in Germany too, with the nation's football association (DFB) trying several tactics.\n\nOnly last weekend the head of referees, Knut Kircher, sat in the TV studio throughout Saturday's matches to try to offer perspective.\n\nIt was the equivalent of Howard Webb, referees' boss at Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO), appearing on Final Score.\n\nThe DFB felt it was positive but Munich-based newspaper Suddeutsche wrote that Kircher should \"focus on improving referee performance\".\n\n\"VAR has caused a lot of unrest here,\" NTV journalist Stephan Uersfeld told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It continues to be what we call 'Schuldverschiebung' - passing on the blame - to the VAR instead of the on-field decisions.\n\n\"While it brings some fairness to the game, it has become a bureaucrat's dream.\"\n\nThe Bundesliga introduced semi-automated offside this season but its microscopic decisions and unreliability have only increased the controversy.\n\nIn January, broadcaster ZDF polled coaches, external in the top two divisions. Of the 27 respondents, 16 said they were unsatisfied by VAR.\n\nAnother survey carried out by NTV, external found that 80% of coaches felt VAR delays were excessively long. The opinion was that VAR has not improved.\n\nIf Premier League fans thought VAR had a better reputation in Germany, that clearly is not the case.\n\nIn Spain you won't see any great public displays of dissatisfaction in the stands. The league has plenty of other problems with officiating.\n\nLast summer, the Spanish FA replaced its entire refereeing committee and became the first major league to separate the roles completely.\n\nA team of 15 dedicated VARs work only as a video assistant.\n\nYet it didn't take long for the first error to happen, and again the semi-automated technology was at fault.\n\nIt failed to identify a goalscorer was offside, the officials did not realise and the goal counted. The VAR team was stood down from its next appointments.\n\nSpecialist VARs have long since been suggested as the big fix.\n\nBut BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague says it has made no difference.\n\n\"There is no agreement of what VAR should do or how referees should act,\" Balague said. \"The suggestion was to use VAR less. Less than what?\n\n\"Why less if it is necessary? But when is it necessary?\"\n\nIt is the question that nobody appears able to answer, in any league.\n\nReal Madrid's TV channel produces videos criticising referees on a weekly basis.\n\nAt the weekend, Barcelona issued a statement, external highlighting \"repeated refereeing decisions it considers damaging to the game\".\n\nIt followed an incredible eight-minute VAR review to disallow a goal for offside against Atletico Madrid. Again, the semi-automated technology was faulty.\n\nMarca analysed, external incidents covered in the league's version of 'Match Officials Mic'd Up'.\n\nIt found 10 errors in the first 18 rounds of games - higher than the Bundesliga or the Premier League. The paper said that there would further errors not covered by the programme.\n\n\"The feeling is that VAR has complicated the game, instead of purifying it,\" Balague added. \"What was meant to simplify decisions, scientific, transparent, logical has instead made them more obscure, interpretative, anything but clear.\n\n\"Supporters in Spain often leave stadiums not just disagreeing with decisions, but also confused by them.\n\n\"The technology feels distant from the emotion of the sport.\"\n\nSerie A is in a unique position.\n\nPlayers, coaches and the media complain just as fiercely as their Premier League counterparts.\n\nDavide Chinellato, the UK correspondent for La Gazzetta dello Sport, says there is one subtle difference. Serie A not only wants VAR, it \"would prefer more intervention rather than less\".\n\n\"Unlike in England, the average Italian fan cannot imagine modern football without it,\" Chinellato told BBC Sport.\n\nThe league is backing reviewing corners and second yellow cards, which is set to be approved by the International Football Association Board on 28 February.\n\n\"What is changing is the level of frustration,\" Chinellato said. \"The expectation in Italy is that every clear mistake should be corrected.\n\n\"When that does not happen, the reaction is not to question VAR itself, but to question the rules governing its use.\"\n\nTake Lazio supporters last month after the club suffered from a couple of errors.\n\n\"Transparency on VAR, audio justifications without logic or sense,\" a banner read.\n\n\"They invent everything to ruin old-fashioned football.\"\n\nThere are similar opinions from players.\n\nVeteran Napoli defender Juan Jesus hit out at current VAR standards., external\n\nHe said: \"There's nothing but controversy. It becomes hard for everyone to remain passionate about football.\"\n\nItaly might like VAR, but difficult and technical decisions are problematic.\n\n\"Fans and media are increasingly impatient with what they see as excessive complexity,\" Chinellato added. \"They want broader, clearer, more straightforward guidelines.\n\n\"A system that aligns more closely with the basic expectation that obvious mistakes should be corrected.\"\n\nNo one has been able to define an obvious error.\n\nIn France, the story is different.\n\nLigue 1 has the highest intervention rate, pretty much every other game.\n\nAcross the first 198 matches there were 83 VAR interventions. The referee has stuck with his decision nine times, far more than any other league.\n\nFrance suffers more errors, 17. That is one every 11.65 games compared to 16 in England.\n\nThere is frustration for supporters, but most of the noise comes from the boardroom.\n\nIt is compounded by the collapse of TV rights. It means budgets have been squeezed.\n\n\"The referee system, including VAR, is costing 25m euros by season,\" L'Equipe journalist Pierre-Etienne Minonzio told BBC Sport.\n\n\"So in a time when all the clubs need money, they think it's too expensive.\"\n\nLuc Hagege, who writes about refereeing for L'Equipe, says there is a \"misunderstanding between the objective of VAR and the perception of some players, coaches, but mostly presidents\".\n\nOne of the most outspoken critics has been Lille president Olivier Letang, who says there is a \"a breakdown of trust\" with referees.\n\n\"The perception is that coaches feel a kind of arrogance from referees,\" Hagege added.\n\n\"Most people, and especially the directors, feel that a gap is growing.\"\n\nMany other figures within clubs have been critical.\n\nLyon captain Corentin Tolisso said in November: \"There are mistakes every weekend. We're paying a very high price for the level of refereeing.\"\n\nHagege said errors are magnified by the clubs and the media.\n\n\"We speak much more of the mistakes than of all the things that have been corrected,\" he added.\n\n\"A few even said that they are fed up with the VAR, we should withdraw it.\"\n\nPerhaps there is one factor which binds all five leagues.\n\nAs Rosetti said, fans and pundits asking \"where is VAR?\"\n\nIt appears to have created a gradual creep into more areas of the game. It will be hard to stop.\n\nFootball must avoid 'microscopic' VAR - Uefa refs' chief\n\nThe big VAR debate: with, without or change its scope?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The Premier League big six are concerned about a proposed centralised advertising model that could generate an additional £750 million annually, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nPremier League officials presented the proposal during a recent shareholder meeting.\n\nThey outlined plans to adopt a US-style system where the league would negotiate and sell a significant portion of pitch-side advertising on behalf of all clubs.\n\nThe model would see 60% of perimetre advertising controlled centrally while increasing the number of top-tier commercial partners from seven to 10.\n\nThe league would then distribute the additional revenue among the 20 clubs based on various performance and commercial criteria.\n\nHowever, the proposal has reportedly been met with scepticism from members of the so-called big six – Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool.\n\nWhile none of the clubs publicly commented, sources suggest several are unconvinced about the proposal’s overall value.\n\nOne major concern centres on the extensive commercial operations already run by top clubs, with many believing their in-house expertise surpasses what a league-wide structure could deliver.\n\nThere are also fears surrounding potential conflicts with existing sponsorship deals.\n\nFor instance, if the league were to secure a central automotive partner, it could clash with club-specific agreements already in place.\n\nUnder current rules, the league allows five minutes of pitch-side advertising per match, with broadcasters controlling three minutes when games are televised.\n\nThe new proposal would significantly change how those commercial opportunities are sold and distributed.\n\nDespite resistance from leading clubs, the initiative could attract support from smaller teams looking to benefit from the global commercial pull of the league’s biggest brands and bolster their finances.\n\nLeague insiders maintain that the proposal is backed by strong financial analysis and is being explored to maximise collective revenues, with further discussions expected before any formal vote is introduced.",

    "fullText": "Is hiring Igor Tudor a stroke of genius or a disastrous appointment by the board?\n\nThe fact that no-one seems able to answer this question with any great conviction has done nothing to either calm my nerves or excite me.\n\nOn the one hand, the Croat has a reasonably impressive track record of improving teams over a short-term period. Essentially, this is all we really need from him so we can avoid relegation, before we appoint a permanent head coach in the summer.\n\nHowever, Tudor is also known for his high-intensity style of play, with training sessions and fitness work testing players to their limits.\n\nNormally this would not concern me, but given our current injury crisis and ongoing issues within our medical department, I am not sure the ghost of Antonio Conte past is the wisest approach right now.\n\nUltimately, as long as Tudor can do enough to keep us in the Premier League, I am not particularly fussed.\n\nHowever, therein lies the problem.\n\nAs a fan, I was excited to see who the board would call upon to rescue our season.\n\nI appreciate the options were limited, given we needed someone who was available on a short-term basis mid-season, but this was also a priceless opportunity to unite an increasingly apathetic fanbase.\n\nIf we are to play our part in redeeming this season, we need to feel invested in our team.\n\nHopefully Tudor can win us over by inspiring – or scaring – the players into delivering something we have been missing so far in this campaign: football that is worth watching.\n\nGet us scoring some goals, winning some games, and keep us in the league.\n\nThen we can bring home everyone's favourite Argentine in the summer and forget this sorry season ever happened.\n\nFind more from Ali Speechly at Women Of The Lane and on Instagram",

    "title": "Bayern Munich ready to battle Premier League giants for Yan Diomande’s signature",
    "description": "FC Bayern is keen on bringing the young star to Bavaria, which would be scary hours for the rest of Europe.",
    "fullText": "Bayern Munich currently houses the world’s best wing duo in Olicho.\n\nLuis Diaz and Michael Olise are undoubtedly the best wing pairing at the moment, with unstoppable dribbling, an incredible knack for finding teammates in open pockets of space, and a knack for scoring the most spectacular goals. One could make career highlight reels for both players from just the goal contributions this season. That is how they’ve both been playing.\n\nOlise’s 13 goals and 25 (!!) assists and Diaz’s 19 (!!) goals and 15 assists across all competitions this season are staggering enough… however, this still doesn’t paint the full picture. Both players have an insane gravitational pull, easily taking out 2-3 players from the equation in every play, creating loads of space for teammates to run into to fashion goal-scoring opportunities. And now Bayern might be ready to bring in another player with a crazy gravitational influence of his own: Yan Diomande.\n\nAccording to a tweet from Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano), FC Bayern and top Premier League clubs will battle it out for Diomande’s services in the summer. RB Leipzig is “yet to decide on a final price tag, but Bayern are keen, and Vincent Kompany also appreciates Diomande.” He ends the tweet with “Premier League clubs are also very keen,” which could imply that Premier League clubs outside of the usual suspects may also be deeply invested in this story.\n\nIn short, it is probably safe to assume that Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham Hotspur are all interested. Maybe even add Aston Villa and Newcastle in there for good measure.\n\nFlorian Plettenberg of Sky (@Plettigoal) tweeted that “Nothing has changed,” and that, “FC Bayern are still involved, staying in contact with the new management and monitoring the situation closely”. He then confirms that there is, “Nothing advanced yet,” and that “in the end, it will come down to the price,” which is understandable, since Leipzig is probably okay with the sale if they could get a huge chunk of change for the star winger. Ominously, he also adds that “All the top Premier League clubs are heavily involved.”\n\nOne thing is for certain: footballing giants are ready to have a go at one another for Diomande’s services. The player is a true diamond, cutting into defenses and using his flair and finesse to create chances from tight spaces. He would complement the duo of Diaz and Olise beautifully, and while he primarily plays on the left, he’s more than capable of being serviceable on the right, which makes him a fantastic player to add to the wing depth and/or rotation. This could also signal that Bayern is invested in developing Lennart Karl as a number 10, but I digress.\n\nYan is shining bright like a Diomande right now, and the sky is the limit on his trajectory.\n\nHopefully that trajectory involves a successful stint at Bayern Munich.",

    "fullText": "The Leasing.com Stadium hosts a historic FA Cup encounter on Monday night as National League North side Macclesfield look to claim another high-profile scalp against Premier League high-flyers Brentford.\n\nThe Silkmen arrive in scintillating form, having secured six wins from their last seven league games while netting a remarkable 22 goals in that span. John Rooney’s side has already etched its name into competition folklore this season by eliminating holders Crystal Palace in the third round—the biggest upset in FA Cup history by league position.\n\nStanding in their way is a Brentford team that has defied preseason expectations to sit seventh in the top flight. Fresh from a hard-fought 1–1 draw with leaders Arsenal on Thursday, the Bees aim to navigate a “trap” fixture and reach the fifth round for only the second time in 19 seasons.\n\nVenue: Leasing.com Stadium, Macclesfield\n\nJohn Rooney remains without star forward Danny Elliott due to a knee injury. Midfielder Josh Kay is also unavailable as he serves a suspension for accumulating yellow cards. The Silkmen will rely on the attacking prowess of D’Mani Mellor, who has scored seven goals in his last seven outings, and former Manchester City prospect Isaac Buckley-Ricketts.\n\nKeith Andrews is expected to rotate his squad following a demanding week in the Premier League. Talisman Igor Thiago is likely to be rested, potentially handing a debut to 19-year-old Kaye Furo. Captain Nathan Collins could return to the starting XI after being an unused substitute in recent matches. Kevin Schade remains sidelined through suspension, while Fábio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries from long-term injuries.\n\nThe Silkmen have turned the Moss Rose into a fortress, taking 33 points from a possible 48 at home this season. Notably, Macclesfield have won three consecutive FA Cup matches this term. If they secure a win tonight, they would be the first team to win four in their debut season (from the first round) since Rangers in 1886. Their attack remains clinical, averaging over three goals per game in their last seven league matches.\n\nThe Bees arrive as heavy favourites but must overcome a difficult non-league test. Notably, top-flight teams have progressed from 26 of 28 FA Cup fourth-round ties against non-league opponents. This is Brentford’s first-ever FA Cup match as a top-flight side against non-league opposition. Despite a demanding schedule, Brentford have shown defensive resilience, keeping a clean sheet in their 2–0 third-round win over Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nMacclesfield Predicted XI: Dearnley; Fensome, Menayese, Heathcote, Lacey; Edmondson, Dawson, Duffy, Buckley-Ricketts; Bughail-Mellor, Mellor\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Valdimarsson; Hickey, Collins, Pinnock, Henry; Yarmolyuk, Henderson, Damsgaard; Donovan, Furo, Nelson\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports 1 and TNT Sports Ultimate. Coverage begins at 19:00 GMT.\n\nRead more- Madueke urges Arsenal fans to ‘get excited’ about trophy chase\n\nSee Also- Longstaff hails ‘massive’ Leeds teammate after ‘tough time’\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "Premier League Wolves edge League Two Grimsby in an \"old school cup tie\" which provided an FA Cup \"throwback\".",
    "fullText": "It was, undeniably, an \"old school cup tie\" - one which both managers agreed provided \"a bit of a throwback\".\n\nThe pitch at Blundell Park was already a quagmire before kick-off between League Two Grimsby Town and Premier League Wolves, and rapidly deteriorated under relentless rainfall on the east coast.\n\nThe ball travelled unpredictably across the sodden surface. Players continued to slide for longer than expected. The pitch markings blurred in the mudbath.\n\nIt would be an understatement to suggest the conditions did not aid either team's ambitions of playing attractive football.\n\nBut they did produce fascinating scenes reminiscent of a bygone era, encapsulating the essence and charm of the FA Cup's history.\n\nThere would be no giant-killing here, however. Despite Grimsby's best efforts to test the visitors' resolve, top-flight strugglers Wolves squeezed into the fifth round by scoring from their only shot on target.\n\n\"It was a proper traditional old school cup tie,\" Grimsby boss David Artell told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It was going to be a fine margins game and that's how it was - we limited a Premier League team to one attempt on target and it's gone in.\n\n\"One chance, one goal for them. It showed how well we played in terrible conditions.\n\n\"The conditions made the game in some respects because it was a bit of a throwback.\"\n\nWolves edge past Grimsby on mudbath to reach fifth round\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards will take great encouragement from the gritty nature of his side's victory as they put their league struggles aside to reach the competition's last 16.\n\nThe 43-year-old reiterated to his players the importance of approaching their trip to face fourth-tier opposition with the right mentality, but his words could scarcely have prepared them for the messy reality on the ground.\n\nIndeed, for some of the Wolves players, this was a brutal introduction to the sort of tie which the FA Cup is famed.\n\n\"It was cold, wet, muddy and difficult conditions, but the lads did really well,\" Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It's mad, I quite enjoy these conditions. But there are not many lads in the dressing room who have seen the lower leagues in England.\n\n\"We go out every game to try and win. Our league form has not been great but a cup run would be unbelievable for us and the fans. Hopefully we can keep going and see where it takes us.\"\n\nWhile Wolves have managed just one win after 26 games in their dismal Premier League campaign, back-to-back FA Cup wins against League Two opponents has extended their cup interest into March.\n\nEdwards will hope the competition can yet provide some joy to supporters with relegation to the Championship seemingly inevitable - however the victories come.\n\n\"It was an aggressive game of headers and volleys,\" joked Edwards, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"They were really difficult conditions for both teams. It was a different type of game and a bit of a throwback.\n\n\"It was an eye-opener for a lot of the players when we arrived, the wind was sideways and there were puddles on the pitch.\n\n\"It was never going to be a day for beautiful football. We played with realism, we showed spirit and fight. We did the basics well and came through.\"\n\nEdwards added: \"It was all set up for a cup upset. We talked a lot about mentality over the past few days and the players showed a real desire to win.\"\n\nEdwards' players will have to adapt to a very different challenge on Wednesday, when they trade the Blundell Park mud for hosting Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\nFor Grimsby boss Artell, a \"bowling green\" surface much closer in quality to the one his side stunned Manchester United on in the League Cup earlier this season would also have been preferable.\n\nThe Mariners, on a 10-game unbeaten run stretching back to December, were full of confidence as they targeted another huge upset but were unable to capitalise on their late chances.\n\n\"From my side, we much prefer to play on a better pitch,\" Artell told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We have limited a Premier League side to one shot on target. I don't think either side did enough to win the game, but those are the fine margins.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Martin Odegaard was introduced from the bench in Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Brentford in midweek, but he was ultimately unable to inspire his side to victory. Upon entering the pitch, he made an immediate impact and helped the Gunners take the lead against determined opposition.\n\nThe match carried added significance after Manchester City had secured victory in their own fixture the previous day, increasing the pressure on Arsenal to respond with three points. The Gunners pushed to extend their advantage, fully aware of the risks associated with a narrow 1 0 scoreline. Despite their efforts, they were unable to find a second goal to put the contest beyond doubt.\n\nBrentford, known for their resilience, capitalised and scored the next and decisive goal of the match. Arsenal continued to search for a late winner and created opportunities in the closing stages, yet they failed to convert their chances and were forced to settle for a single point. With the season approaching its conclusion and Manchester City close behind in the title race, it was not the result Arsenal would have hoped for.\n\nOdegaard addressed the outcome in his customary programme notes before a home fixture. As reported by Arsenal Media, he wrote, “We were looking strong but then the game changed again. Brentford played to their strengths and made it hard for us, as they have done to many teams all season. We needed to carry on playing how we had been before we scored the goal, so it was frustrating that we couldn’t do that. We should have been better at not conceding too many set pieces and throw ins, and then we need to do better when the ball comes into the box – myself first.”\n\nMartin Odegaard v Brentford. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nHis remarks explain the fine margins at this stage of the campaign. Arsenal remain in contention, but with Manchester City maintaining close pursuit, every dropped point carries significant weight in the battle for the Premier League crown.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!

    "fullText": "Arsenal host Wigan Athletic in the fourth round of the FA Cup this weekend.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side remain in contention for four trophies this season. The North Londoners lead the Premier League by four points, while Arsenal will also meet Manchester City in the League Cup final in March. Now, the Gunners focus on FA Cup action and the visit of Wigan to the Emirates Stadium.\n\nThe Latics are 22nd in League One amid a tough campaign and are winless in their last eight league games.\n\nMikel Arteta must manage his squad with Arsenal’s absentees increasing in recent days. Kai Havertz has suffered a fresh injury setback and is set for another spell on the sidelines, where he joins Mikel Merino, who is facing five months out.\n\nWilliam Saliba missed the midweek draw at Brentford through illness and remains a doubt, while Martin Odegaard sustained another knee knock. Max Dowman also remains out with an ankle issue.\n\nExpect Arsenal to rotate their side for this one. Gabriel Martinelli, who hit a hat-trick at Portsmouth in round three, will hope for another outing from the start. Fellow forward Gabriel Jesus should also come in, allowing Viktor Gyokeres a rest.\n\nArsenal predicted XI: Kepa; White, Mosquera, Calafiori, Lewis-Skelly; Norgaard, Rice, Eze; Madueke, Jesus, Martinelli.\n\nArsenal vs Wigan Athletic will kick off at the Emirates at16:30 GMT on Sunday 15th February 2026.\n\nThe game is being broadcast on TNT Sports 1 and discovery+ for UK viewers.\n\nRead – Premier League Awards: Anxious Arsenal and Sesko’s stunner\n\nSee more – Premier League Team of the Week – Bogle, Hannibal, Semenyo\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Leeds United head to Birmingham City in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday lunchtime.\n\nDaniel Farke’s side team have pulled clear of the relegation places in the Premier League and head into this game after a spirited draw at Chelsea. Leeds recovered from two goals down to earn a point at Stamford Bridge in midweek.\n\nThe trip to St Andrews will see Leeds face a Birmingham team with big ambitions. The Blues earned promotion to the Championship in record-breaking fashion last season and are bidding for back-to-back promotions. A seven-game unbeaten run has lifted Birmingham within a point of the play-offs.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has been passed fit to feature after missing the draw at Chelsea through illness. The 28-year-old is Leeds’ top scorer this season with 10 goals in the Premier League.\n\nAlso struggling to make the trip to Birmingham is Anton Stach. The German midfielder has a hip issue and has missed the club’s last two fixtures. Defender Pascal Struijk is ruled out with a hip injury of his own.\n\nLeeds predicted XI: Darlow; Bornauw, Bijol, Ampadu; Justin, Tanaka, Gruev, Byram; Piroe, Nmecha, Okafor.\n\nBirmingham City vs Leeds United will kick off at 12pm GMT on Sunday 15th February 2026.\n\nThe fixture will be available to watch on TV in the UK on TNT Sports 3.\n\nRead – Premier League Awards: Anxious Arsenal and Sesko’s stunner\n\nSee more – Premier League Team of the Week – Bogle, Hannibal, Semenyo\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are interested in signing Wolves attacker Mateus Mane.\n\nThe 18-year-old is highly rated in the Premier League, and he has impressed with Wolves this season. Mane has 7 goals and 6 assists in all competitions this season.\n\nManchester United are looking to add depth to the attacking unit and believes the 18-year-old could be ideal for it in the long term. Manchester United are monitoring him closely and could make a move at the end of the season.\n\nThe player is valued at £50 million as per Fichajes, and it remains to be seen whether Manchester United are prepared to pay up. It is a steep price to pay for a young player who is still largely unproven at the highest level.\n\nMeanwhile, the player is also a target for Liverpool. They have already held talks with the player and his representatives. Manchester United need to act quickly if they want to beat their rivals to his signature. The 18-year-old is a promising young player with a bright future, and he could justify the £50 million investment in the long run.\n\nMan Utd given boost in the race for £35m EPL star who could link up with McTominay\n\nMan United eye blockbuster move for £50m wonderkid, but Liverpool could ruin their plans\n\nMan United ready to sign £35m game-changing utility man with 13 assists\n\nMan Utd given boost in the race for £35m EPL star who could link up with McTominay\n\nMateus Mane of Wolverhampton Wanderers walks over to take a corner. (Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nHe will add explosive pace, flair, and goals in the final third. Manchester United need more depth on the flanks, and the young attacker could be the ideal fit for them. Wolves are likely to go down at the end of the season, and the 18-year-old will want to compete at a higher level. The opportunity to join Manchester United or Liverpool will be exciting for him.\n\nLiverpool need more quality on the flanks as well, and they have already taken initial steps to sign the player. It will be interesting to see where the young attacker ends up.\n\nMan United ready to sign £35m game-changing utility man with 13 assists",

    "description": "Burnley manager Scott Parker is under increasing pressure as the Premier League side are dumped out of the FA Cup by League One Mansfield.",
    "fullText": "League One Mansfield produced an FA Cup fairytale to remember at Turf Moor on Saturday, but for Premier League strugglers Burnley, it was another afternoon to forget.\n\nLouis Reed's 80th-minute free-kick into the top corner of the Clarets' goal was a cue for 3,500 travelling Mansfield fans to erupt in sheer delight.\n\nFor the home faithful, it had the opposite affect - boos and jeers started coming from large sections at Turf Moor, and at full-time it became a cacophony of discontent.\n\nWith just two wins in their past 19 games in all competitions and nine points adrift of safety in the Premier League, an FA Cup run represented the last bit of hope in what has been a dismal return to the top flight.\n\n\"The pressure is on Scott Parker from a certain section of the Burnley fans, they think his time is up,\" Chris Sutton said on BBC Final Score.\n\nThe teams immediately around Burnley in the Premier League table have all changed their managers this season. Could they be next?\n\nLosing to the team 13th in English football's third tier represents a new low in Burnley's season just as renewed optimism was starting to creep in.\n\nTheir remarkable 3-2 comeback win at Crystal Palace on Wednesday was their first victory in 16 Premier League games. The gloom started to lift slightly.\n\nParker's side showed real fight and spirit at Selhurst Park, which made his decision to make nine changes to his team for the visit of Mansfield all the more baffling.\n\n\"When you don't go through to the next round there will always be questions asked about that [team selection] but I don't think that was the main factor today,\" Parker told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We lacked a little something in those final moments. That was where we have fallen way short today.\"\n\nBurnley are not the first, nor will they be the last, Premier League side to ring the changes for a cup game against lower opposition.\n\nBut having been dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Cardiff City back in September, the FA Cup was the supporters' only chance to distract themselves from looming relegation.\n\n\"It is embarrassing, the changes he made. Play your strongest team. He made nine changes, and the second half was embarrassing,\" former Burnley defender David Unsworth said on BBC Radio Lancashire.\n\n\"It is an embarrassing afternoon for Burnley. It gives the owner a decision to make now. He has to listen to the fans, they are not happy.\n\n\"For the first time I have witnessed all home ends of the stadium booing and disgruntlement. The owner has a decision to make.\"\n\nChairman Alan Pace, the leader of the club's owners ALK Capital, is not the most popular at Turf Moor either at the moment.\n\nThis week he angered fans when, during an interview with BBC Football Focus, he dismissed fan concerns as coming from those who \"just play this game on a computer somewhere\".\n\nHe went on to liken those same fans to three-year-old toddlers having a tantrum.\n\nPace used Saturday's programme notes to clarify his words, writing: \"I did not intend for my words to upset, but I did mean what I was trying to say which was that, just because some are upset, does not mean that things are dire and without hope.\"\n\nMany Burnley fans will be hoping Pace calls time on Parker's spell in charge, though the former Premier League midfielder said he is confident is his own position at the club.\n\n\"I am very comfortable in my position at this present moment in time. We have lost a game of football today against a team we should be beating,\" Parker told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We had numerous chances. Of course you are always going to judge a result and today is a bad one, we take the flak for that, the team and myself.\"\n\nLeague One Mansfield shock Burnley in FA Cup\n\nWhile Burnley's failures were significant, it's important not to underplay Mansfield's achievement.\n\nThe Stags have eliminated a top-flight side from the FA Cup for the first time since February 1969, and will now play in the fifth round for the first time since 1974-75.\n\nDespite falling behind early on, Nigel Clough's side dug deep and hung in - Kyle Knoyle's heroic goalline clearance at 1-0 was typical of their spirit.\n\nWhen their chances came, they took them. Rhys Oates headed in the equaliser shortly after the break, before captain Reed produced a free-kick his club's fans will never forget.\n\n\"As soon as it left my boot I felt it going in. I have been working on them throughout the week. The lads said, 'This is your moment, go and take it'. Thankfully, I did,\" said Reed.\n\n\"It shows what a group we have got. The draws we keep getting are big ones. I felt we were always in the game even when we were 1-0 down at half-time.\n\n\"I think it's a cliche, whoever we get in the next round, we will go into that with the same energy as this one.\"\n\nSutton said: \"It's an amazing story and Nigel Clough, at the helm, has done a brilliant job at Mansfield.\n\n\"To think Mansfield came from behind against Premier League opposition, they kept on peppering Burnley's goal, but the free-kick from Louis Reed deserves to win any cup tie.\"\n\nWin a cup tie it did - but it could also end up costing Parker his job.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Arsenal lead Manchester City by four points at the top of the Premier League table, yet many of the Gunners’ supporters remain uneasy. In recent seasons, City have dominated the title race, with themselves and Liverpool sharing the championship between them since 2018.\n\nLiverpool, despite being the defending champions, has not matched their usual standards this term, which has strengthened the perception that this could finally be Arsenal’s season. The Gunners have placed themselves in a strong position and will be determined to ensure they capitalise on the opportunity.\n\nIn previous campaigns, Arsenal have fallen short in decisive moments, and their recent reduction to a four-point advantage has heightened anxiety among some supporters. With 12 matches remaining, the margin for error is slim, and any dropped points could quickly shift the balance of the title race.\n\nThe players at the Emirates Stadium understand the importance of maintaining focus and composure. Consistency, discipline, and mental resilience will be essential if they are to convert their current position into a league triumph. The closing stages of the season often test a squad’s depth and resolve, particularly when facing a rival with Manchester City’s experience and pedigree.\n\nPep Guardiola has acknowledged the psychological dimension of the title race. Speaking via Metro Sports, he said:\n\n‘I would prefer to be in the position Arsenal are in than our position.\n\n‘If I would be in the position with four points in front of second, with 12 games left, I would not be relaxed. Imagine being four points behind, I am less relaxed.\n\n‘I would still prefer to be in the position Arsenal are in than we are.’\n\nGuardiola’s comments underline the tension on both sides of the contest. While Arsenal hold the advantage, Manchester City’s pursuit ensures the race remains intense. The coming weeks will likely determine whether the Gunners can withstand the pressure and secure the title ahead of their closest challengers.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!

    "fullText": "Guglielmo Vicario could depart Tottenham at the end of this season, with a return to Serie A appearing increasingly likely. The Italian goalkeeper has impressed since arriving at the club, earning praise for producing a series of outstanding saves across numerous fixtures.\n\nDespite Tottenham’s inconsistent form, Vicario has remained one of their most reliable performers. His displays have attracted attention from several leading clubs, and the North London side may find it difficult to retain him if their struggles persist. While the Lilywhites would prefer to keep a player who has stood out amid challenging circumstances, the conclusion of the campaign may prompt a decisive development regarding his future.\n\nJuventus are understood to be keen on strengthening their squad with his addition. His experience in the Premier League is believed to have convinced them that he possesses the qualities required to thrive in their system. A return to Italy could hold particular appeal, especially given the prestige associated with representing Juventus.\n\nHowever, the Bianconeri are not alone in their pursuit. According to Tuttojuve, Inter Milan is also interested in securing Vicario’s signature. The Nerazzurri reportedly regard him as a strong candidate to reinforce their goalkeeping department and are prepared to rival Juventus in any potential move.\n\n(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)\n\nInter are said to be considering him as a possible replacement for their current first-choice goalkeeper, with the end of the season viewed as an appropriate moment to initiate change. Such competition would inevitably complicate negotiations and increase the pressure on Tottenham to clarify their position.\n\nVicario’s consistent performances have enhanced his reputation, and interest from major Serie A clubs underlines his growing stature. As the season approaches its conclusion, his next decision could shape not only his own career trajectory but also the strategic planning of the clubs seeking his services.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have been widely tipped to secure the Premier League title by the end of this season, and their performances in Europe have also positioned them among the favourites to win the Champions League. Since returning to the competition, the Gunners have made a significant impact, reaching the semi-final last term before losing to eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nTheir European pedigree has strengthened this campaign further. Arsenal defeated Real Madrid on their way to the semi-finals previously, underlining their ability to overcome elite opposition. This term, they have maintained outstanding form by winning all their league phase matches, reinforcing the belief among supporters that they can go all the way.\n\nDespite their consistency, Arsenal are fully aware of the challenges that lie ahead in the latter stages of the tournament. The Champions League remains fiercely competitive, with several heavyweight clubs still in contention. While their domestic and continental form has raised hopes of an unprecedented quadruple, the calibre of opposition makes such an achievement extremely demanding.\n\nSupporters remain optimistic, encouraged by the team’s resilience and tactical maturity under Mikel Arteta. However, experience suggests that decisive moments against Europe’s most established sides will determine whether Arsenal can convert promise into silverware.\n\n(Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nDidi Hamann has identified Bayern Munich as the side most capable of halting Arsenal’s progress. Speaking as reported by the Metro, he said, ‘Usually in the past, Bayern have always got the better of Arsenal.\n\n‘So, I think that was one of the reasons why Arsenal was desperate to show them, you know, this year is our year.\n\n‘Bayern have dropped a few points in the last two weeks. Against Hoffenheim, there was an early sending off, and Hoffenheim hit the crossbar and had three clear cut chances. They should have been ahead at half time.\n\n‘So Bayern Munich are not firing as they did in the autumn. But if they do get back to their form, I would favour Bayern Munich over two games.\n\n‘But it would be a fantastic game because obviously the first game was breathtaking.’\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!

    "fullText": "Inter Milan are keen on signing highly-rated Club Brugge midfielder Aleksandar Stankovic (h/t Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano).\n\nThe Nerazzurri sold the Serbian youngster to the Belgian club last summer while including buy-back clauses worth €23 million for the summer of 2026 and €25 million for next year.\n\nFollowing his breakout season with Brugge, Inter are planning to bring Stankovic back to San Siro this summer.\n\nThe 20-year-old’s impressive performances have also caught Premier League giants’ attention, including Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United.\n\nInter, however, have the edge due to the youngster’s priority for his boyhood club.\n\nThe Nerazzurri, who top the Serie A table by five points, might need more midfield reinforcements ahead of next season due to the uncertain futures of a few players.\n\nDravide Frattesi came close to joining Nottingham Forest in the winter window, and he should be eyeing an exit due to his lack of regular game time.\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan’s contract is up, and Inter haven’t decided whether to renew it or part ways with him.\n\nInter will need to resolve Hakan Calhanoglu’s future quickly, as his contract expires next year.\n\nGalatasaray are working to lure the Turkish defensive midfielder, while Inter haven’t stepped up the renewal talks.\n\nStankovic has established himself as a linchpin in Club Brugge’s midfield, bagging seven goals and four assists in 37 appearances this season.\n\nHis stellar performances in the Champions League against Atalanta, Marseille and Kairat have been pivotal in Brugge’s qualification to the play-offs.\n\nThe Serbian international is an exciting defensive midfield talent who combines his physicality with technical prowess to a greater effect.\n\nHis strong and tall build helps him dominate high-volume aerial and ground duels.\n\nStankovic also thrives as an excellent playmaker and tempo controller due to his vision and passing range.\n\nHe can be an ideal long-term successor of Calhanoglu and can also function in a box-to-box role.",

    "fullText": "We need to accept that Liverpool are not in the running to retain their Premier League title.\n\nIt looks like Arsenal will contest the title with Manchester City - with the Reds very much stuck in the fight for Champions League football.\n\nIt’s been a difficult season for Arne Slot - who has been unable to get any kind of consistency out of the league champions. The head coach has also struggled to integrate £450m worth of new signings - and he has been dealing with significant injury troubles.\n\nPoor results have left the Anfield side fighting it out with Chelsea and Manchester United for a Champions League place - with Aston Villa even further ahead in the table.\n\nIt’s overwhelmingly likely that fifth place will be enough to secure a return to the Champions League due to England's coefficient - bringing with it potentially over £100m of participation fees, prize money and broadcast revenues.\n\nIt’s money that Liverpool cannot afford to live without - but there is every reason to believe that the club are about to take a decisive step towards securing it.\n\nThis midweek round of fixtures saw rivals Man Utd and Chelsea slip up - encountering draws against West Ham and Leeds respectively.\n\nAs a consequence the Reds have been able to claw back two more points in the race to gain a top-five finish courtesy of their 1-0 win up in Sunderland.\n\nAround the corner is a very winnable run of fixtures - and Arne Slot needs to be aiming to win 15 points out of the next 15.\n\nFirst of all across their next three league fixtures Liverpool will play three of the current bottom four. Crisis club Nottingham Forest are in 17th - and beyond the Tricky Trees away Liverpool will play West Ham (18) at home and Wolves (20) away.\n\nAfter that there are more bottom-dwellers in the shape of Tottenham (16) at home and Brighton (14) away.\n\nFollowing the Brighton game we will encounter the international window - with Liverpool facing Fulham (h), Everton (a) and Crystal Palace (h) in their subsequent three fixtures.\n\nMan Utd by contrast in their next five matches face only Crystal Palace who are currently in the bottom half of the table.\n\nBefore March is out they will play Everton (a), Palace (h), Newcastle (a), Aston Villa (h) and Bournemouth (a) - games they will not be looking forward to.\n\nAlthough Chelsea have got a gentle-looking game against Burnley coming up next at home after that they play two of the top three in succession - facing both Arsenal and Aston Villa away from home.\n\nBefore the international break they will play Newcastle at home and Everton away - by no means easy fixtures. Right after the break they will face Man City and Man Utd at home - meaning they are due to play every one of the top four in their next seven fixtures.\n\nRight now Liverpool fans are not so optimistic about making it back into the Champions League - particularly as they have to play Man Utd, Chelsea, Villa and Brentford in the run-in.\n\nBut there is every reason to believe that by the March international window the table will look very different - and Liverpool will have some breathing space in the chase for the rich prizes on offer in the Champions League.",

Since they've come in they've understood what English football and culture is about,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"They will have a conversation with you. Obviously, the gaffer has the final decision but they've been brilliant.\n\n\"They understand the league and understand that we know the league and our opinions matter and having Dean [Holden] on the staff is massive for them.\"\n\nFriday, 13 February - 19:45 GMT\n\nWatch on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website and app; listen on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Humberside\n\nWhite agrees that Jakirovic's work has been built on solid foundations with sporting director Jared Dublin and head of recruitment Martin Hodge.\n\nHowever, against a backdrop of a lengthy injury list that at one point saw Jakirovic say he had 11 fit senior players, he believes the manager deserves \"a tremendous amount of credit\".\n\n\"It should be said that going into this season little was expected of a team working under a two-window EFL transfer restriction - only free signings and loans without fees were permitted - but the quality of recruitment has been nothing short of remarkable,\" said White.\n\n\"Adding to their challenges have been one serious injury after another to some of their key players like Oli McBurnie, John Lundstram, Joe Gelhardt and Mo Belloumi - a list that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the full injury crisis the club has found itself in consistently.\n\n\"Yet still they plough on, with a shot at the top two still a very real possibility - particularly given Coventry's recent downturn in form - so a return to the Premier League after nine years away shouldn't be ruled out.\n\n\"And Jakirovic deserves a tremendous amount of credit for steering it all in the right direction.\"\n\nJakirovic was born in to a football family in Mostar, then part of Yugoslavia, in December 1976.\n\nHis father Enver played as a goalkeeper for NK Neretva in modern-day Croatia and it was there that the Tigers boss began his own playing career.\n\nAcross 20 years he played as a defensive midfielder in Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Austria and also won five caps for Bosnia.\n\nA third generation of the family is now looking to make their way in the game - he gave a professional debut to his son Leon at Dinamo Zagreb when the latter was just 16 in May 2024.\n\nThe teenager moved on to Italian super club Inter Milan last month.\n\nAfter hanging up his boots, Jakirovic started his senior coaching career at Croatian second division side Sesvete in 2017 and then moved on to top tier side Gorica the following year.\n\nA brief spell with Slovenian champions Maribor followed before he guided Bosnian outfit Zrinjski Mostar to the title in 2021-22.\n\nHe returned to Croatia to take over at Rijeka in November 2022 but quit to replace former Liverpool midfielder Igor Biscan at Dinamo Zagreb in August 2023 and won the Croatian double that season.\n\nHowever, after becoming the first team to concede nine goals in a Champions League game, when they were demolished 9-2 by Bayern Munich, Jakirovic left in September 2024.\n\nTurkish strugglers Kayserispor appointed him as their boss in January last year and he led them away from relegation danger before making the move to England.\n\n\"When you look at Sergej's career he was successful everywhere he went,\" owner Acun Ilicali told BBC Radio Humberside in the summer after making Jakirovic his fifth boss since taking over in January 2022.\n\n\"He played the football at Kayserispor that I want to see my team play.\n\n\"When you look at his career he has the talent to make all his teams play similar games.\"\n\nDespite the early scepticism, it looks like this \"bizarre appointment\" could just be the perfect one.\n\nLatest Hull City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Hull City content on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains the key things a manager can do before, during and after matches to get the results they want.",
    "fullText": "I've talked a lot in this column about all the different work a manager does in trying to build everything you need in place at a club to be successful, but this week I want to talk about what happens around a game itself - before, during and afterwards.\n\nFor me, preparation for any game always started two hours after the one I had just managed.\n\nMy drive home to the south coast on a Saturday night after a game could take three hours or more, and much of that would be spent on the phone while I had precious quiet time.\n\nWhen I was at Stoke City, my chairman Peter Coates would always speak to me then if we lost. If we'd won, he never bothered, knowing I wouldn't need comforting.\n\nWin or lose, however, I would always ring my assistants, David Kemp and Gerry Francis, and we would discuss the game in finer detail - away from the stadium to give us a different perspective.\n\nThen I would contact my chief scout, who would have been at our next opponent's game, for a quick run-down of what he had seen - their shape, patterns, strength, weaknesses and any injuries.\n\nSunday was about spending all day with the family, but then either late on Sunday night or early on Monday morning I would be back up the motorway, with a clear view of what I believed was needed for our next game.\n\nThe players' week is always scheduled around the next game too. Monday was a light training session with the players who played on Saturday, and a debrief in a match-related game versus the reserves.\n\nThroughout my managerial career, I always wanted to show people I worked with what I wanted, and we would go through positives and negatives from Saturday live on the pitch.\n\nIf they needed it clarified then, whatever it was, it was sorted out in a game-related session on the grass. The players who hadn't started on Saturday stayed out afterwards, and had a much tougher morning.\n\nThis kind of work was always vital to me for us to get things right the following Saturday. Whether it was at Stoke, Crystal Palace or West Brom, I always recognised each team's strengths, and we all needed to be aware of the team's identity.\n\nYes, at each of those clubs we took different routes to get to our objective, but the aims - and challenges - were the same.\n\nHaving that clear identity and also a system that suits your players is paramount to success, but as a manager you also have to be confident and brave in leading and directing your strong personal views.\n\nPlayers will always test you, but will respect clarity and leadership if it stands firm under pressure. The reason I am mentioning this now, in respect to game days, is because it matters the most then.\n\nThe best example I can give is in the week before games against the very top teams I went overboard trying to exude confidence in my team and my tactics.\n\nIt didn't always work, but I believed that if they felt that from me, it would help them come the big day.\n\nAfter a full week of working on every player - drilling into each individual the understanding of their role in the team and how it would affect everything if he did not carry it off - I would then set about the ways we could hurt the opposition.\n\nObviously set-plays have now become a byword for how teams can do that successfully, but that was the case before me and it is the same now I have retired.\n\nAs well as attacking set-plays, defending them was something else we would work on. Whether it was in attack or defence, every individual knew his own personal challenge.\n\nOn the Saturday, I would turn up for a home game at about 11am, and in my early years I would also train myself before games.\n\nAt this stage, with only a few hours to go until kick-off, I would run through everything again and wait until the lads started to arrive. Once they were all settled, I would have a quick chat - nothing too rousing! - and then leave the dressing room.\n\nOnce the opposition teamsheet arrived, about 75 minutes before kick-off, I would check our markers against their players - this was important because I always man-marked!\n\nI would take that board into our dressing room, and out I would go again, until they arrived back from their warm-ups. Everything said from then on until the players left to start the game was confidence filling, with no negatives at all.\n\nThe actual team talk itself and the last things you said to the players could be very different depending on the occasion. It was not always me who gave it, either.\n\nAgain at Stoke, I got Ricardo Fuller up to speak right before our FA Cup semi-final against Bolton at Wembley in 2011.\n\nRic was such a great character and also a player with exceptional ability. Unfortunately he was injured and out of the game but he delivered a once-in-a-lifetime speech to the team, quoting Nelson Mandela.\n\nWe won the game 5-0 and to this day I am sure Ric believes his speech drove the lads to that famous result. The players would all tell you it certainly got them going.\n\nIt just shows you that the way to succeed in football management is not set in stone. You need tremendous resilience, yes, but also many more human strings to your bow.\n\nIn my early years at Stoke, we were always the underdogs, and the atmosphere was off the charts, never mind who we played.\n\nAs time went by and we became established, teams coming to Stoke were much more prepared for the experience, and our supporters became less reliant on our underdog status and rightly so.\n\nTo make up for this I began to use more psychological methods to generate the atmosphere in the dressing room that would help motivate the players.\n\nThat might mean mentioning recent comments or coverage that was negative towards us, or even bringing up stuff I had remembered from our early days at the club - anything that criticised us in any shape of form, that I knew would generate a positive response from the lads.\n\nThis method helped us greatly going into games we were expected to win.\n\nWhat you say at half-time is important too.\n\nI would always get two or three main points over about how the match was going, but you have to be careful what you say and do because the break can dramatically change the whole flow of the game.\n\nI've watched my team be really on it in the first half, then completely lose control of the game inside the first five minutes of the second half - and vice versa.\n\nIt's something all managers and coaches must be wary of, and I certainly was.\n\nI often tell the story of how Stoke were once 2-0 up at Blackburn at half-time and, as they were walking off the pitch, I just got a feeling a bit of complacency was setting in with our lads, who were patting each other on the back.\n\nSo, I decided to liven the dressing room up and picked on my captain Ryan Shawcross, who - by the way - had been absolutely outstanding that half. I gave him both barrels, and that left everyone extremely shocked.\n\nThe second half came and went with us seeing the game out and getting a deserved victory, but Ryan came to see me on the Monday - he was still pretty upset and did not know what had happened.\n\nI explained my reasons - I knew Blackburn boss Sam Allardyce would be after a big response from his lads in the second half, so to compensate for that I had to put everyone on edge.\n\nIt worked but, trust me, that was not always the case.\n\nAs a manager, you can obviously change things when the game is going on too.\n\nWhen I started in management, there was only one substitute permitted, but today you can change five players.\n\nThat's half of the outfield team that have started the game so, with squads so large now too, then it certainly can be a massive help to the coach.\n\nI look at the top teams' benches now and sometimes I can't believe the quality on there, which is something else that has changed in the past 30 years.\n\nMaking changes is always a pre-meditated option. Yes, I have taken players off for playing poorly, because we needed to hold on to a lead or were desperately trying to claw a goal back, but most of the time you have still got a plan.\n\nAs I've mentioned before when I talked about scouting players, the game has moved on to such an extent in the past 30 years that computers play a big part now in providing you with information.\n\nIt is the same during today's games too, to the extent computers on the side of the pitch can release certain data that can have an effect on a manager's thinking, either around individuals for substitutions or overall team analysis.\n\nI always trusted my own eyes, though. Although I have seen some fantastic advancements made with team analysis and individuals' live game data, I always backed my experience and judgement.\n\nOf course those decisions can have a huge impact if you get them right. I listen now to some commentators drooling over substitutions that change games, and what a genius the manager was to make those changes.\n\nWell, I have had those plaudits myself but, if the truth be known, I had picked the wrong XI to start with.\n\nIf I really was such a genius, I would have started with a different XI and got it right at the beginning.\n\nImmediately after full-time, I was always quick to move on, whatever the result.\n\nI would always explain to the players on Monday if I needed to get things off my chest about their performances.\n\nIt is always the manager who gets more of a grilling at full-time - many questions always followed the end of each Premier League fixture, with the agenda driven by the result.\n\nAs a manager, you are thrust almost immediately into the jaws of our unforgiving media and questions about tactics, substitutions and your team's overall performance are fired at you, sometimes under severe pressure.\n\nObviously the more damning investigations are aimed at the losing team's manager, where it is more than likely the questions are preordained.\n\nFor the winner, there are plaudits - but whatever the outcome, you have to think forwards not back.\n\nI was soon back in my car and heading home... thinking about the next match.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "fullText": "A whole host of players have been linked with a Merseyside move in recent months but one of the most intriguing rumours centres around Sandro Tonali, who is reportedly seeking a move away from Newcastle.\n\nNews broke on deadline day of the winter window that the Italian had been offered to Arsenal by his agent, but subsequent reports have suggested the Reds have opened talks to bring him to Anfield.\n\nThe 25-year-old has featured in almost every game for Newcastle this season but only featured from the bench in the Magpies recent victory over Tottenham.\n\nHaving made 70 Premier League and 28 Champions League appearances in his career, Tonali represents a ready-made option for Liverpool, but a deal will be incredibly complicated.\n\nLast summer saw Alexander Isak swap St James’ Park for Anfield in a British record transfer, but the deal will no doubt have left a sour taste in the mouth of his former employer.\n\nThe Swede went on strike, refusing to play for Eddie Howe’s side to force through a transfer – a move that obviously ruffled some feathers.\n\nNow, less than a year later, Liverpool are back in for one of Newcastle’s best players and the Isak saga will still be fresh in everyone’s minds.\n\nThe Reds aren’t the only team interested in Tonali, so a transfer away from the North East feels likely, but if the Italian chooses Liverpool as his next destination, it may be difficult for Newcastle to stand in his way.",

    "fullText": "Igor Thiago has reflected on his childhood watching Manchester United, which is where his love for football was first established.\n\nThe Brentford talisman chatted with TNT Sports ahead of his side’s clash with league leaders Arsenal last night.\n\nAfter being asked whether he’d always dreamed of being a professional player, he responded: “No, I didn’t even like it that much. But my brother started talking to me and made me watch the Premier League every weekend, especially Manchester United.\n\n“And then I started paying closer attention to United. From there it grew on me with feelings of love and affection. Then, I wanted to become a player too”.\n\n(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nWhile a striker addition isn’t United’s priority heading into the summer window, it’s certainly an admission that’ll have sparked the interest of INEOS chiefs.\n\nThiago is enjoying a tremendous campaign leading the Bees’ frontline – in a season in which they were widely anticipated to struggle in the absence of Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.\n\nHowever, they, as much as Keith Andreews might want to play down the prospect, are well in the mix for a European finish, and Thiago has been crucial to that.\n\nThe 24-year-old has netted a remarkable 17 goals in 26 matches, ranking him second-placed behind Erling Haaland in the Golden Boot race.\n\nHe has outscored costly summer signings such as Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike, both of whom are on 10 goals each, as well as Antoine Semenyo (13 goals), who moved from Bournemouth to Manchester City last month.\n\n(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nIn fact, United fans might recall that Thiago was on the scoresheet twice earlier this term when Brentford hosted the Reds at the Gtech Community Stadium back in September.\n\nHaving been injured for his team’s visit in 2024/2025, the Brazilian will experience Old Trafford for the first time in April, when United will be looking to avenge their 3-1 defeat, this time with Michael Carrick in the dugout.\n\nIn-form Premier League talisman says watching Man Utd with ‘love and affection’ made him want to be a player\n\nOwen fires warning to Man Utd that it’s going to be ‘nigh on impossible’ to replace star who could leave in summer\n\nMail: United ‘expected to make offer’ for £180k-a-week star with agreement now looking ‘increasingly likely’",

    "description": "Brentford 1-1 Arsenal: The Bees hit back against the Gunners, who lacked enough conviction in their play, meaning Man City are now just four points behind the Premier League leaders",
    "fullText": "Arsenal did the difficult part, but then faltered at what they’re supposed to be best at, making this title challenge that bit more testing. Except, much of that was down to Brentford. Keith Andrews’s side beat – or perhaps drew with – Arsenal at their own game.\n\nBrentford fully deserved Keane Lewis-Potter’s set-piece equaliser, and the 1-1 draw ultimately leaves Arsenal’s lead down to just four points.\n\nThey even looked likelier to win it at the end, Gabriel Martinelli’s late chance only came after Arsenal required crucial interventions from Cristhian Mosquera and Declan Rice.\n\nThat is why Brentford are still seen as one of the Premier League’s acid tests, perhaps even more testing than ever before. It is the most classic battle, the one teams have to really work through.\n\nFailing to win this fixture isn’t a sign you won’t win the title, but it’s a match that goes some way to showing your mettle and how you can really go through the gears in a title race.\n\nArsenal’s minimalism wasn’t enough here. It may end up serving as another warning.\n\nMikel Arteta will nevertheless be most frustrated that it should have been enough. Arsenal had the lead through Noni Madueke’s fine header, only for the team that normally shuts down games to see themselves opened up again and again.\n\nBrentford just forced them open. On conceding the goal, they immediately upped it in so many ways. It’s rare to see Arsenal so threatened on set-pieces.\n\nMaybe part of that was down to the absence of William Saliba.\n\nThe Gunners didn’t get going until it was too late in the game, allowing Brentford that margin.\n\nThat could be seen in the fact that they had just one shot in the first half, their lowest in an opening 45 minutes since a 5-0 thrashing to Manchester City in August 2021.\n\nIt is a balance that Arteta still has to figure out, as he too often leans towards control too often. The sense remains of a team trying to win the league on calculated probabilities rather than the true end product, of being so close now that the coach is now not taking enough risks.\n\nYou almost extend it to the expenditure.\n\nOne reason that Arsenal are where they are across all competitions is their squad depth, and yet there are moments when it’s hard not to wonder whether they could have used their budget in a slightly different way.\n\nThe starting attack in this game was a prime example. As good as Viktor Gyokeres and Madueke are in their own way, would the club have been better served pooling the money for both together, in the region of £107m, and going for one “killer”. An elevated star that they are still missing.\n\nEven Leandro Trossard, brilliant as he’s been for the club, often feels like he should be the impact sub rather than the starter.\n\nEberechi Eze was signed to offer that extra stardust, but it is going to be difficult to rise to the occasion when he is constantly in and out.\n\nAnd, after that first half, Arteta made the changes.\n\nMartin Odegaard was introduced. The Norwegian did have an initial impact, which helped force the opener.\n\nThere was a sense of what might have been.\n\nMadueke remains a tantalisingly frustrating player, as if there are still elements missing to complete his game. One is delivery.\n\nThere are so many occasions when he does wonders to beat his man, and often embarrasses them, only to try the same slowly floated cross that is so easy to defend against.\n\nHe perhaps saw the benefit of a more traditional effort on 61 minutes, which allowed the 23-year-old to show the productive player he often promises to be.\n\nArsenal’s changes had admittedly ensured that they were starting to pen Brentford in, with Odegaard looking especially lively.\n\nIt was his pressing that forced Andrews’s backline into an error, the ball then arriving at the feet of Piero Hincapie. He hooked over a fine cross, although one where Madueke looked like he might have stepped forward a touch too early. It was instead Caoimhin Kelleher who was wrong-footed, although only because Madueke showed impressive agility.\n\nThe winger arched back to loop a header across the goal and into the bottom corner.\n\nThat should have been that, only for Odegaard to then look a bit more culpable at the other end. He only stuck his leg out for one of Brentford’s aerial assaults, allowing Lewis-Potter to plunder a brilliant header.\n\nArsenal were lucky not to concede from that route again.\n\nBrentford are more than just an awkward team, or a physical one. There’s so much calculation in everything they do, as befitting a modern club built on analytics. You can almost see the science behind every move, the manner in which the ball is played into areas of probability.\n\nA favoured attack is one of the wingers immediately playing a first-time ball across the opposition area on the break, which tends to instantly cause angst.\n\nArsenal had to be on their toes, from start to especially raucous finish. The end of the game had a lot of football in it, particularly in a helter-skelter stoppage time. David Raya had already offered one of the saves of the season from Igor Thiago and had to be constantly alert as a relentless Brentford just kept roaring forward. The home side could have won it at least twice in the closing stages, Arsenal once.\n\nThose late blocks may prove important to Arsenal in another way. It may end up a good point in the grander scheme of things. Rather than such one-off moments, though, Arteta and his staff will be looking at those two lost points.\n\nIf Arsenal wanted more, however, they should have done more.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): We are struggling for goalkeepers this week, if I'm being totally honest. However, to play how he played against Arsenal and make a critical save right at the end was huge. The save against Gabriel Martinelli was probably the deciding factor that got him into the team.\n\nLamare Bogarde (Aston Villa): If you looked purely at stats, you would have said Aston Villa should have absolutely thrashed Brighton...except they didn't. It was a Brighton team that played very, very well and Bogarde stood up to the task at right back. He's a midfielder by trade so to see him playing right-back - which he has done a few times this season - was fantastic.\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool): Obviously gets the goal, but up at Sunderland - that wind, that crowd and the pitch was really poor - the ability to be a class above everyone else. He made sure Liverpool weren't really stretched. Defensively it was all Virgil van Dijk.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City): He looks like he's been playing for Manchester City for about eight years. Solid, composed, wonderful on the ball - he's just fitted in seamlessly. He helped City to a clean sheet in a 3-0 win against Fulham. He kept Fulham right at arm's length. Very, very good, for me.\n\nBashir Humphreys (Burnley): Probably one of the best performances of the week, and for him this season. Very strong in a tackle, offered loads going forward and defensively solid.\n\nMateus Fernandes (West Ham): He's one of those players that looks like he would infuriate me, both to play with and against. He did all the ratty things really well. He's got high energy, he's young, talented and he's the heartbeat of the team. He gets caught up sometimes in silly moments, trying to buy fouls when he doesn't really have to. I thought it was his best performance for West Ham this season - a very mature performance.\n\nNico O'Reilly (Manchester City): I love seeing him play in midfield. He adds the legs and energy into City's midfield - and obviously he gets his goal there as well. I feel the more he plays in his natural position - with Rodri around him - he'll be a star, not only for Manchester City but England moving forward as well.\n\nJacob Ramsey (Newcastle): When Newcastle's midfield has been torn up because of injury or suspension in the last few weeks, he's quietly gone about his business. He's been excellent and made sure he delivers in terms of performances and now goals. I think he's a real steal for Newcastle.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): I'm going to give a sympathy vote to Cole Palmer. He was in there last week because he scored a hat-trick against Wolves - but this week: goal, assist, and is a level above everyone else - but what a miss that was. If he scores that goal, Chelsea obviously win the game. He's a shoo-in. That miss does put a little stain on it, but I thought his overall performance was miles better.\n\nJoao Pedro (Chelsea): He's flying! Everyone puts that down to Liam Rosenior, but I put it down to having Cole Palmer back. Being able to have a player that can play behind him, find the passes and allows him to link up and move around, is why you're seeing the best of him. I think that is five in five now for Joao.\n\nJorgen Strand Larsen (Crystal Palace): I've been very critical of his move to Crystal Palace. I thought they got a lesser player than Jean-Philippe Mateta, however he scored two goal. Palace didn't win, but he's off the mark. You have to say fair play, he did well.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): It was Manchester City's first opportunity in a while to play before Arsenal and pile the pressure on.\n\nPep Guardiola guided City to a 3-0 win against Fulham, dominated the game, took Erling Haaland off and rested him, and was in a position to have John Stones on the bench and not have to use him.\n\nRuben Dias was back, he got to rest Rodri, his rotation was good, and he will feel really strongly about being in a position to kick on for the rest of the season with all his players starting to come back.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "description": "Arsenal are four points clear at the top of the Premier League with 12 games to play - but will recent history repeat itself?",
    "fullText": "The pressure in the title race was always going to come for Arsenal, and maybe after the 1-1 draw at Brentford this is where it turns up a notch for Mikel Arteta's side.\n\nIt must be pointed out that they are in the best position of all clubs chasing the title, four points clear at the top of the Premier League and with just three losses all season. But with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City the side chasing them, that gap does not feel huge.\n\nPart of that is down to the fact that if Arsenal had beaten the Bees they would have been six points clear and had the chance to extend that to nine points with a win over Wolves next Wednesday, with the game taking place before Manchester City are next in action.\n\nAnother factor is that Manchester City have produced incredible runs of form to chase down titles in previous years and the Gunners have finished second for three successive seasons.\n\nWith 12 games to go, history does not favour Arsenal with their end-of-season form.\n\nIn the past five seasons, only on one occasion have Arsenal won 10 of their final 12 Premier League matches in a campaign.\n\nIn those seasons, the Gunners have never won more points in their final 12 games than the team that went on to win the title.\n\nLeaders Arsenal frustrated in draw at Brentford\n\nWith the noise around Arsenal and their history under Arteta when trying to win the title, the Gunners boss was asked if he needs to ensure that his side do not panic and remain focused on their task.\n\n\"That's what we have to do,\" he said. \"I mean we are going to be willing and preparing to win every single match and the only thing that we can do is focus on that and raise the levels collectively and individually to be better than the opponent every week.\n\n\"It's just the things that we have to do, that's the most important thing.\"\n\nBefore Manchester City's dramatic win against Liverpool on Sunday, it looked as though Arsenal would be nine points clear.\n\nBut after Erling Haaland's late penalty to secure the three points and their win against Fulham on Wednesday, the gap was reduced to three points and the pressure was put back on to the Gunners.\n\nWhen asked if playing after City is bringing a new pressure to his team, Arteta said: \"I don't think so, I think we played well after them a few times this season and we have won games.\"\n\nOf the 17 games in which Arsenal have scored first in the Premier League this season, the draw at Brentford was just the second time they have failed to win, along with their loss to Manchester United in January.\n\nMidfielder Declan Rice could not have put it better: \"This is a rollercoaster of a season.\n\n\"You can't be naive to think this is going to be easy. We are playing against the best teams week in, week out. We have to keep pushing and believing in ourselves, controlling the controllables.\n\n\"We have to block out the outside noise. We have done that really well. People are going to talk up the title race and Arsenal but we have a really calm group.\"\n\nThe Gunners came into this match without centre-back William Saliba, who missed out through illness.\n\nSaliba is a key part of this Arsenal side and his partnership with Gabriel Magalhaes is a big reason why they have conceded just 18 goals in the league this season.\n\nSince the start of 2022-23, Arsenal have a 68.6% win rate and average 2.3 points per game with Saliba playing in the Premier League (W83 D24 L14), compared to a 42.1% win rate and 1.6 points per game on average without him (W8 D7 L4).\n\nThe Gunners are also without Kai Havertz, who has picked up a muscle injury after only just returning from a long-term knee issue last month.\n\nAs well as those two changes, Arteta brought Viktor Gyokeres and Piero Hincapie into the starting XI at Brentford.\n\nBut the Gunners have only won two of the past seven Premier League games in which they've made four or more changes to their starting XI from the previous match (D4 L1).\n\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on TNT Sports: \"That's what people were shouting at me as I was coming off the pitch, 'Man City are coming to get you', but at the end of the day Arsenal are four points clear.\n\n\"You get knocked down, you get up again. Let's see who the fighters are and let's see who is going to win this. They could have put down a big marker if they won the match, but it never looked like that was going to be the case.\"\n\nIn two of their three second-placed finishes in recent years, Arsenal have finished behind Manchester City, which is why the talk about this title race carries so many emotional scars for supporters.\n\n\"What Man City have got is the know-how and the recent history behind them,\" Peter Crouch added on TNT.\n\n\"That can lead to nervous tensions around the stadium, certainly around the back end of the season.\n\n\"Having someone like Man City and Pep behind you, you are always going to be looking over your shoulder. But you would much rather be in Arsenal's position.\"\n\nCrouch believes Arsenal will never have a better chance to win the title.\n\n\"Man City are not the Man City of old, Liverpool aren't, Manchester United aren't what they have been, Chelsea the same,\" he said. \"There is a lack of quality in the top areas [of the league]. The bar has been set high in the past years.\n\n\"Now is a real opportunity for Arsenal. If they don't get over the line, there needs to be more questions answered.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Gerwyn Price ended Michael van Gerwen's unbeaten start to the Premier League by claiming a 6-3 victory in night two's final in Antwerp.\n\nVan Gerwen won the season opener in Newcastle last week and beat Luke Littler in the semis on his way to another final.\n\nBut the seven-time champion was no match for Welshman Price, who had come through two final-leg deciders before lifting the title in more comfortable fashion.\n\nLittler had earlier opened the tournament's first visit to Belgium by edging a final-leg decider of his own against rival Luke Humphries.\n\nFor Price it was a welcome victory to confirm the fine form he had been in of late.\n\n\"I think I'm playing some of the best stuff I've played, I'm just not winning tournaments,\" Price told Sky Sports after his victory.\n\n\"There's no way I can't win a major, bigger Pro Tours, Europeans. Averages are just for show and if you play well on your darts and win matches you win tournaments. I'm going to get some.\"\n\nThe PDC Premier League visited Belgium for the first time in the competition's 21-year history, and the 10,000 darts fanatics inside the AFAS Dome were treated to plenty of thrills.\n\nPremier League Darts 2026 fixtures, results and table\n\nPremier League: Price beats Van Gerwen to win Antwerp final - as it happened\n\nThe night started with a bang as the two biggest darts stars in the world played out a high-quality contest that went down to a final-leg decider.\n\nHumphries and Littler both hit seven 180s and averaged over 102 and 105 respectively, but both were surprisingly poor on the outer ring - missing 28 doubles between them.\n\nHumphries was the better player throughout, but at 4-1 up he started missing doubles badly, 17 in all by the end of the match, as Littler engineered an escape to make it five straight wins against his big rival.\n\nWorld number two Humphries has now lost 11 of his 15 Premier League meetings with Littler, with his last victory of any kind against the 19-year-old coming in the tournament's final last May.\n\nThe past four defeats before this one came in tournament finals, and perhaps it is becoming a mental barrier now for the defending Premier League champion as his scoring was solid all game, but he could just not get over the line.\n\nComebacks were a theme of the opening quarter-finals with all bar Van Gerwen's stroll against an out-of-sorts Josh Rock filled with excitement.\n\nStephen Bunting finished bottom of the table last year after failing to win a single match in the first eight weeks, but looked to have one sewn up when leading 4-0, only to watch Jonny Clayton reel off six straight legs to win 6-4.\n\nAnd Price had to come from 3-1 and 4-2 down to beat Gian van Veen in the first of his two 6-5 victories on the night.\n\nPrice's second final-leg decider came against good friend and Wales World Cup team-mate Clayton in a nip-and-tuck battle.\n\nPrice had four 180s to Clayton's three and averaged just over 100 - but was forced to win the final two legs under extreme pressure to make the final.\n\nIt was no real surprise given Price had won nine in a row against his compatriot and 15 of their past 16 meetings.\n\nVan Gerwen did not impress in his opener but certainly did in a strange 6-4 victory over Littler where seven of the 10 legs went against the darts.\n\nThe Dutchman averaged just over 100 with an off-colour Littler down at 95 and - strangely for him - only managing a single maximum, while Van Gerwen hit four.\n\nBut it was the finishing under pressure that made the difference as the Dutchman hit six of 13 attempts at a double, including finishing off a 10-darter, in a performance that was much more like the Van Gerwen of old.\n\nDespite incredible back-to-back finishes of 167 and 160 in the final Van Gerwen was always second best, but a win and a final after two nights is a great start considering he failed to win a single night in last season's competition.\n\nThe results also leave Littler and Humphries in fifth and sixth in the table with just one win each, but there is no panic just yet with 14 weeks of fixtures remaining.\n\nThursday, 12 February - FAS Dome, Antwerp\n\nLuke Littler 6-5 Luke Humphries\n\nMichael van Gerwen 6-2 Josh Rock\n\nJonny Clayton 6-4 Stephen Bunting\n\nPremier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night.\n\nEach of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.\n\nPlayers earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.\n\nThe top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.\n\nIf players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.\n\nThursday, 19 February - OVO Hydro, Glasgow\n\nStephen Bunting v Gian van Veen\n\nMichael van Gerwen v Luke Littler\n\nBunting/Van Veen v Humphries/Rock\n\nVan Gerwen/Littler v Clayton/Price\n\nBunting/Van Veen/Humphries/Rock v Van Gerwen/Littler/Clayton/Price",

Here are the current favourites…\n\nVitor Pereira (Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nVitor Pereira is the current frontrunner amongst the bookmakers. The Portuguese manager was sacked by Wolves in November after failing to win a game all season.\n\nDespite a poor campaign this season, Pereira successfully saved Wolves from relegation last season, even though he took over the club when they were in 19th. This run included wins over Tottenham and a league double over Manchester United.\n\nThomas Frank (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nTottenham sacked Thomas Frank just one day before Sean Dyche was relieved of his duties as Nottingham Forest boss.\n\nThe Dane has only won two Premier League matches since October for Spurs, but boasts an impressive seven years as Brentford manager. In that time he took them from the Championship to Premier League regulars.\n\nMauricio Pochettino (Photo by Omar Vega/Getty Images)\n\nThe Argentine is currently manager of America and is likely to remain in that post until after the World Cup in the summer. However, after that he may be open to coming back to England.\n\nPochettino had a very successful spell at Tottenham, reaching the Champions League final and finishing second in the Premier League.\n\nSince then he has also managed Paris St. Germain where he won Ligue 1 and Chelsea reaching the League Cup final.\n\nRoberto De Zerbi (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nFormer Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi has also been linked with the job.\n\nDe Zerbi has now left the French club after a season and a half in charge, following group phase exit their Champions League. But he did record a second-placed finish in his first campaign in charge, and also guided the Seagulls into the Europa League during his time on the south coast.\n\nNOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND – JANUARY 29: Robbie Keane, Head Coach of Ferencvarosi TC, looks on prior to the UEFA Europa League 2025/26 League Phase MD8 match between Nottingham Forest FC and Ferencvarosi TC at City Ground on January 29, 2026 in Nottingham, England.

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly set to challenge Bayern Munich for the signing of Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\nThis one will have Chelsea fans laughing right away, because it is yet another Brighton player they are being linked with!\n\nObviously with sporting director Paul Winstanley, who seems to have all the power at the club, being an ex-Brighton staff member, a lot of their new signings and staff members have come from this club over recent times.\n\nAnd now, it looks like they might be looking at signing yet another player from the Premier League club, although I’m not sure I see too much in this one personally.\n\nBart Verbruggen in action for Brighton against Chelsea. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nChelsea are gearing up to challenge Bayern Munich for the signing of Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen and crucially.\n\nAccording to a report from TEAMtalk this week, The Blues are prepared to match the Seagulls’ £50million tag.\n\nThe report also claims that Paul Winstanley and head of global goalkeeping Ben Roberts both carried out extensive work on Verbruggen during their time at Brighton.\n\nBrighton would demand in excess of £50million for Verbruggen, a figure Chelsea are apparently prepared to negotiate with.\n\nNicolas Jackson is not having a great time in Bayern Munich at the moment, only playing a bit-part role there out on loan. He was even left out of the latest match day squad for them yesterday, signalling a sign that actually, they don’t even rate him that highly and he will not be staying there beyond the summer.\n\nIt looks like we might finally see defender Mamadou Sarr in action on Friday night since his return to the club in the January window. Sarr is expected to either start or play some minutes in the FA Cup game vs Hull City!",

    "fullText": "Arsenal travel to Brentford on Thursday night, aiming to preserve their six-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nThe Gunners have moved into February with immense momentum, following four consecutive victories that have solidified their title charge. Manager Mikel Arteta oversaw a dominant 3–0 success over Sunderland last weekend, ending the day nine points clear before Manchester City’s late comeback at Anfield. Arsenal arrive in West London seeking a fourth consecutive clean sheet, a defensive feat they last achieved during a record-breaking streak in late 2024.\n\nMikel Arteta navigates fitness concerns regarding several key creative figures. Notably, a persistent hip injury keeps Bukayo Saka on the sidelines. Furthermore, Martin Ødegaard remains a major doubt after missing the last two matches with a minor muscle issue. Consequently, Kai Havertz likely retains his place in a deeper midfield role. Leandro Trossard adds to the headache; he limped off against Sunderland with a calf injury.\n\nDavid Raya starts in goal. Riccardo Calafiori likely features in the defensive line ahead of him, though Piero Hincapie offers a viable alternative. In midfield, Declan Rice and Martin Zubimendi aim to dictate the tempo. Up front, Viktor Gyökeres returns to the starting lineup. He scored twice off the bench last weekend. Gabriel Martinelli and Noni Madueke support him in a revamped attack.\n\nArsenal predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday, 12 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nLive television coverage will be available in the UK on TNT Sports 1. Extended highlights will be shown on Match of the Day on Friday night.\n\nArsenal predicted lineup vs Brentford.

    "fullText": "Premier League leaders Arsenal travel to the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday night, aiming to banish a peculiar midweek curse and maintain their six-point advantage at the top of the table.\n\nThe Gunners arrive in West London having “banished their January blues,” recording four consecutive wins across all competitions, including a clinical 3–0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday. However, Mikel Arteta’s side faces a historical hurdle: despite an impressive overall midweek record, Arsenal have failed to win—or even score—in any of their last three Premier League games played specifically on a Thursday. Standing in their way is a high-flying Brentford side that has emerged as the season’s “surprise package”. Under Keith Andrews, the seventh-placed Bees have won their last two matches, including a dramatic 3–2 triumph at St James’ Park last weekend.\n\nDate: Thursday, 12 February 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Arsenal 2–0 Brentford (2 Dec 2025), Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews remains without Kevin Schade, who serves the second of a three-match suspension for violent conduct. Reiss Nelson is ineligible to face his parent club, while long-term absentees Fabio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries. After a strong showing in Newcastle, the Bees are expected to remain largely unchanged, though Yehor Yarmolyuk is pushing for a start in midfield.\n\nMikel Arteta faces several late fitness calls. Bukayo Saka (hip) and Martin Ødegaard (muscle) both missed the Sunderland win and remain doubtful for the derby. Leandro Trossard is also a major doubt after sustaining a calf issue late against the Black Cats. However, Viktor Gyökeres is poised for a recall to the starting XI after his decisive brace off the bench last weekend.\n\nThe Gunners have maintained a high level of performance in local fixtures. Notably, Arsenal have lost just one of their last 23 Premier League London derbies (W17 D5). Defensively, they arrive in peak condition, having kept three consecutive clean sheets in all competitions heading into Thursday’s clash. However, the “Thursday curse” remains a concern, as the team has failed to score in their last three league outings on this specific day.\n\nThe Bees have turned their home ground into a nightmare for visitors. Notably, Igor Thiago has been in sensational form, netting nine goals in his last 10 home matches—a tally bettered only by Erling Haaland this season. Brentford also boast a clinical edge, with an xG per shot of 0.16, the best by any Premier League team in the last five seasons. While they are winless in eight against the Gunners, their current form suggests they are more than capable of an upset.\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Van den Berg, Ajer, Henry; Janelt, Henderson; Ouattara, Jensen, Lewis-Potter; Thiago\n\nArsenal Predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe match will be televised live in the UK on TNT Sports 1, with coverage starting at 19:00 GMT ahead of the 20:00 kick-off. Fans in the United States can stream the action exclusively on Peacock Premium.\n\nRead more- Lineker jokes that Mainoo should sue former Man United boss Amorim\n\nSee Also- Every Premier League team ranked by their five-year net spend\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest sacked manager Sean Dyche on Wednesday after a dismal draw with Wolves left them hovering above the Premier League relegation zone.\n\n\"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that Sean Dyche has been relieved of his duties as head coach,\" the club said in a statement on X.\n\n\"We would like to thank Sean and his staff for their efforts during their time at the club and we wish them the best of luck for the future.\"\n\nForest's 0-0 home draw with bottom club Wolves left them just three points clear of the bottom three.\n\nSpeaking after Wednesday's stalemate, a gloomy Dyche acknowledged his job was in peril, and that volatile owner Evangelos Marinakis could well decide to swing the axe.\n\nMarinakis has already sacked Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Postecoglou this season, and his patience once again wore thin after Forest drew a blank despite having 35 shots.\n\nDyche's team were booed off at the final whistle.\n\nDyche said he was a \"realist\" about his precarious situation and spoke like a manager resigned to his fate.\n\n\"The owner has been fair to me, without a shadow of a doubt,\" he said. \"If anyone chooses to change in football now, that's their decision. We've all seen it,\" he said.\n\n\"If the owner wants to make a change, then that's up to him, and that's the way football is now, that's just the reality of it.\n\n\"He's been absolutely fair with me from the beginning to the end, and I've been fair with him and told him the truth every step of the way.\"\n\nForest thrived under Nuno last season, securing a place in the Europa League, but the Portuguese coach was dismissed after falling out with Marinakis over transfers.",

    "description": "The Clarets' remarkable first-half fightback keeps alive their slim hopes of Premier League survival, but where does it leave Crystal Palace?",
    "fullText": "When Burnley fans first heard the news that their team bus had been caught up in traffic on the way to Selhurst Park – and that their game at Crystal Palace would be delayed by 10 minutes as a result – they may have been fearing the worst.\n\nAfter all, this was hardly ideal preparation for a team lying second bottom in the Premier League table, 11 points adrift of safety and without a win in their last 16 top-flight games.\n\nWith 12 minutes of the first half remaining, by which time Jorgen Strand Larsen's double had helped Palace breeze into a 2-0 first-half lead, the Clarets faithful will have been resigned to another bruising defeat, continuing their agonising slide back towards the Championship.\n\nTuesday's encounter had been following a familiar script. Parker's team had not only given away two easy goals, they had failed to register a shot on target in the first 39 minutes of the contest.\n\nThe seven that followed had to be seen to be believed.\n\nHannibal Mejbri made it 2-1 with his first goal of the season, before Jaidon Anthony arrowed a low shot into the corner to bring Burnley level four minutes later.\n\nBurnley's extraordinary comeback was complete in first-half stoppage time, when goalkeeper Dean Henderson parried Bashir Humphreys' header on to the foot of Jefferson Lerma and into the net to spark jubilant, almost disbelieving scenes in the away end.\n\nThis extraordinary result may prove too little, too late for the Clarets in their battle to avoid relegation.\n\nBut it was just the tonic for manager Scott Parker, who was subjected to chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'you're getting sacked in the morning' by his own supporters during last weekend's defeat by West Ham at Turf Moor.\n\n'Up to owner to make change' - Dyche under major scrutiny\n\nWill West Ham make 40-point mark crucial in relegation fight?\n\nHaving endured one of his toughest afternoons of his Burnley tenure on Saturday, Parker looked like he was trying to keep a lid on his emotions after Tuesday's astonishing victory.\n\nBut you could hear the fierce pride in Parker's voice as he spoke about his players' heroics in his post-match interview with TNT Sports.\n\n\"There aren't many teams who would come back here after going 2-0 down,\" he said. \"It speaks absolute volumes for this group.\n\n\"If there was ever any question about how together this group is, how committed this group is, how resilient this group is – [tonight] said it all, really.\"\n\nParker's team remain nine points adrift of safety with only 12 matches of the 2025/26 season left to play.\n\nBut neither Parker, nor his players have given up hope of mounting a late survival charge.\n\n\"There has always been belief [that we can stay up],\" he continued. \"The results over the last few months probably haven't gone our way, but tonight that definitely was the case,\" he said.\n\n\"Coming off the back of an incredibly tough game for us at the weekend – for many reasons – that performance showed a group that is full of resilience, full of commitment.\n\n\"You don't get that result without proper resilience, standing up to certain battles and certain situations. The biggest lesson for any group is to keep coming back up.\n\n\"We certainly did that tonight.\"\n\nSo where does Tuesday's result leave Palace?\n\nIn stark contrast to his opposite number, Oliver Glasner looked ashen-faced when he addressed the media after the full-time whistle, which was greeted by loud boos from the Palace supporters.\n\nHaving watched his team arrest a 12-match winless run against arch rivals Brighton last time out, Glasner looked set to mark his 100th match in charge of the club with another morale-boosting win after Strand Larsen's double.\n\nBut Palace froze after Mejbri had pulled a goal back for Burnley, who took full advantage of the hosts' inertia to inflict one of the most painful defeats of the Austrian's Selhurst Park tenure.\n\n\"It's not acceptable,\" Glasner, who is leaving the club in the summer, told TNT Sports. \"I can't explain it. Maybe [the first 39 minutes] were too easy.\n\n\"The start was very good. We controlled everything, [but] I've watched all the goals back and it's just not acceptable how we defended as a team – just jogging around, not in the duels, not in the second balls.\"\n\nAnother issue, according to Glasner, is the presence of a Marc Guehi-sized hole in the Palace defence.\n\nThe England defender left for Manchester City for an initial £20m last month in a move which incurred the wrath of Glasner, who announced his own departure not long afterwards.\n\n\"Right now, we don't have someone on the pitch who leads the team in these moments, who makes players calm and decides the meaning of the game,\" he said.\n\n\"I praise the boys very often for their effort. When you throw the game away like we did, you don't deserve to win.\"\n\nPalace are still eight points above the bottom three – a sizeable cushion, but one not comfortable enough for a side with only one win in all competitions since 11 December.\n\nDefeat at home to Wolves in their next league game really would set alarm bells ringing.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola vowed his Manchester City side would \"breathe down the neck of Arsenal\" as they aim to hunt down the Premier League leaders in this fascinating title race.\n\nThey backed up Sunday's astonishing comeback victory at champions Liverpool by taking apart Fulham in the first half on Wednesday night.\n\nGuardiola's men have started to gain momentum and now trail the Gunners by just three points with an intriguing battle developing between the top two.\n\nMikel Arteta's side travel to tricky Brentford on Thursday hoping to regain their six-point advantage but go into the game under pressure knowing City did their job in style.\n\nGuardiola, though, was not getting drawn into title talk at this stage of the season, saying: \"We were not nine points [adrift] before Anfield, we are not three points [adrift] before Brentford v Arsenal, after that we will see.\n\n\"I always say the focus is to grow, grow, grow. It's how we can be more consistent over 90 minutes, how we can be better and the players feel that [they are] doing what we want to do.\n\n\"'We can do it in terms of mentality and patterns defensively and offensively. We are doing that.\"\n\nMan City beat Fulham to close to three points on Arsenal\n\nThe celebrations between a group of City players at full-time to preserve a clean sheet epitomised the togetherness that has been forged and the character they are able to display.\n\nThe result at Anfield appears to have given City and Guardiola renewed belief that they are capable of chasing down Arsenal, despite not being at their rampant best this season.\n\nCity have the know-how of getting the job done, having been top dogs in six of the past eight seasons, while Arsenal will be hoping there isn't a familiar story to the past three campaigns when they have finished runners-up.\n\nFormer Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Radio Live: \"There are still fragilities we haven't seen in the past perhaps, but they still have the armoury I think to go on a crazy run now and be unbeaten and all that stuff.\n\n\"It's not that big of a statement to say that. The manner in which they won on Sunday, the psychological side. They have gone 'this is ours for the taking'.\n\n\"The belief runs through the whole club and fans where they think, 'do you know what, we still have a great chance'. That will give them belief for this run-in.\"\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer added on BBC Match of the Day: \"I don't think it would surprise many people if they went on a run. Particularly after the game at the weekend, you could see they were full of confidence, belief and energy.\n\n\"They have done their job tonight and put the pressure back on Arsenal with a three-point gap now.\"\n\nThe weight of expectation will lie heavily on Arsenal's shoulders before facing the Bees, with an uncomfortable night's sleep in store after seeing City take apart Fulham in a clinical first-half showing.\n\nBut Arsenal know they can respond by claiming three points at the G Tech Stadium and if they follow it up by beating bottom side Wolves next Wednesday, the tantalising prospect of a nine-point lead awaits.\n\nThe two sides meet in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday 22 March with the chance of inflicting the first direct psychological blow.\n\nRecent history shows that seven of the last 12 winners of the EFL Cup have gone on to win at least one other trophy in the same season, highlighting the importance of claiming the trophy at Wembley next month.\n\nThey are scheduled to meet at Etihad Stadium in the Premier League in April but the rivalry could see them face each other another three times if they progress in both the Champions League and FA Cup.\n\nWhile Arsenal did not sign anyone in the January transfer window, City added Antoine Semenyo, who has scored five goals already, and England international Marc Guehi, who contributed to a clean sheet.\n\nGuardiola said his side are \"growing\", adding: \"We were together, more calm with the ball, we made inside, outside [runs]. I would say the position was not perfect for Nico O'Reilly and Phil [Foden] but sometimes it happens to be in better positions, but in general really pleased.\n\n\"We suffered a lot at Fulham and today, after physically and emotionally at Anfield, it is really tricky but we talked a lot and I said 'guys we have to do it again' and we did it.\"\n\nA long and arduous season is bound to take its toll at some stage and star striker Erling Haaland could do with a rest.\n\nThe Norwegian scored in Wednesday's 3-0 win over Fulham to take his tally to 42 in as many games this season for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old, though, scored his first non-penalty league goal since 20 December against West Ham, ending a run of 24 shots from open play without scoring.\n\nBut he featured in only the first half against the Cottagers, being replaced by Omar Marmoush at half-time.\n\nGuardiola said the player was feeling some \"niggles\", adding: \"He [Haaland] said, 'I don't feel comfortable' and 3-0 [ahead] with a lot of games and having Omar, common sense [to subsititute him].",

    "description": "Liverpool have won just once in the Premier League in 2026 - so will they stick with Arne Slot, who took them to the title last season?",
    "fullText": "Arne Slot afforded himself a little smile when he admitted that this was the toughest season in his career \"by a mile\" on Tuesday.\n\nNo matter what Slot achieves across the rest of his managerial days, this campaign has pushed the Dutchman to new limits.\n\nAfter romping to the Premier League title in his first season in charge at Liverpool, the second has seen Slot and his side face a barrage of \"setbacks\", \"hits\" and \"bad luck\" as he mentioned during his news conference on Tuesday. More on that later.\n\nThe raw numbers do not make for good reading. Since winning their first five league matches at the start of the season, Liverpool have taken just 24 points from their next 20 games.\n\nFor context, Roy Hodgson won 25 points from 20 games before he was sacked as Liverpool boss in 2010-11.\n\nIn 2026 alone, Liverpool have won just one of their seven league games and earlier this season, nine defeats in 12 games was their worst run of form in 71 years.\n\n\"They've been really bad champions\", was the verdict of Roy Keane on Sky Sports on Sunday, after Liverpool fell to their eighth league defeat of the season.\n\nPut simply, such numbers are not good enough for the reigning champions, particularly given their £450m summer spend, and Slot conceded as much when he said it would be not be acceptable if Liverpool failed to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nThat Liverpool are still in with a chance of qualifying is primarily due to the fact that rivals such as Chelsea and Manchester United have gone through torrid spells too.\n\nBoth those clubs have sacked their managers this season after a breakdown in the relationship between the coach and senior figures.\n\nIn Slot's case, there is serious credit in the bank. The 47-year-old is the only coach alongside Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola and Liverpool predecesor Jurgen Klopp to win the title since 2017-18.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in 2020-21, the season after Liverpool won the league under Klopp, they were eighth after 28 games but Klopp's future was never truly in doubt. They won 26 points from their last 30 available and ended up finishing third.\n\nHowever, in the 2022-23 season Klopp's side failed to qualify for the Champions League - something Slot says would \"not be acceptable\" this term.\n\nAsked what impact such a scenario would have on his own position, Slot replied: \"That is again a difficult question for me to answer because I don't decide on my future.\n\n\"The only thing I do know is that it happened before, and ­recently, and it didn't affect the future of that manager. But that doesn't guarantee anything, of course.\n\n\"In general, [with] managers, especially at this club - maybe somewhere else it is mainly, but not only, about results - they also look at the progress the players make, the progress the team makes, the circumstances are sometimes taken into account.\n\n\"That is not at all clubs, but I think I am working at a club that does look at those things. As it has shown in the past when the club did not qualify for the Champions League.\"\n\nTraditionally, Liverpool are not a club that sacks coaches and the understanding is that the Anfield hierarchy is behind Slot, until the end of the season at least.\n\nLast week, an in-house roundtable chat between Slot, sporting director Richard Hughes and CEO Billy Hogan was posted across Liverpool's social channels.\n\nAlthough it was filmed in mid-January, the video showcased a strong relationship between all. Hughes was of course instrumental in Slot's appointment and getting rid of him would mean admitting that it didn't work out.\n\nYet there is a clear awareness that performances and results must improve and Slot is aware of the pressure, both internally and externally.\n\nBoos aren't exactly the norm at Anfield but they have been heard more frequently this season.\n\nAway from the cameras, Slot is seen as calm, consistent and level-headed, but admissions that he finds it \"hard to hear\" claims that Liverpool's football has been \"dull\" speak of a man that is battling hard, and who is insistent his side can do \"something special\".\n\nThere is certainly mitigation for Liverpool's struggles. The death of Diogo Jota last summer was tragic and last week former Liverpool keeper Caoimhín Kelleher said that meant the football side of things was not important this season for Liverpool as players dealt with his loss.\n\nSlot said the meeting he held with the players after Jota's funeral was one of the most difficult things he's done in his life.\n\nNo one at the club will use Jota's passing as an excuse for their form but the impact of such a tragedy must be considered.\n\nLiverpool have also faced an injury crisis, including the long-term absences of Giovanni Leoni, Conor Bradley and Alexander Isak, while going through a squad transition that has focused on technical footballers, rather than physical signings.\n\nThe feeling behind that strategy is that long-term, the game will move towards a focus on possession, rather than the emphasis on physicality seen this season.\n\nThe form of key players dipping hasn't helped either, so a range of factors have combined to leave Liverpool where they are.\n\nRegardless, given the quality of players at their disposal, it is widely accepted that the defending champions are indeed \"not performing to Liverpool's standard\", as Slot has said.\n\nHis suggestion on Tuesday that Liverpool have only been outplayed in three halves this season was far-fetched, however.\n\nWhen a team loses eight and draws six out of 25 games, such a claim doesn't stand up.\n\n\"The question is are we unlucky or is it part of who we are? That is something we can only find out in the upcoming three to four months,\" Slot said, when asked about the bad luck his side have had.\n\nLiverpool still have the chance of silverware in the FA Cup and Champions League, but the minimum aim for the rest of the campaign will be to qualify for the Champions League next season.\n\nTheir financial model is based upon sustainability and there will be serious implications if they miss out.\n\nLike that Klopp side of 2020-21, they need to be \"close to perfection\" as Slot said from now on, starting with the trip to Sunderland on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, there is an elephant in the room after Xabi Alonso left his position as Real Madrid manager, with the former Liverpool midfielder touted as a possible replacement for Slot.\n\nHowever, given no manager in Liverpool's history has a better win percentage (61%) than Slot, it is understandable why, for now at least, he retains the club's backing.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Has Milner's record pursuit become a problem for Brighton?",
    "description": "James Milner is one game away from drawing level with Gareth Barry for most Premier League appearances, but has the record become a problem for Brighton?",
    "fullText": "Brighton midfielder James Milner is on the verge of equalling the all-time record for most Premier League appearances.\n\nThe current holder is former Aston Villa and Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry, who played in 653 top-flight games.\n\nMilner could draw level with Barry on Wednesday evening when Brighton are at Villa and while Seagulls fans will no doubt celebrate such a moment, there will also likely be a sense of relief.\n\nThat's because for some supporters there is a feeling that the 40-year-old Milner has been making late appearances off the bench just to edge closer to the record and not necessarily for the benefit of the team.\n\n\"Not for the first time this season, Fabian Hurzeler made a substitution involving James Milner [against Fulham recently] which made little sense,\" Seagulls fan Scott McCarthy, of We are Brighton, said.\n\n\"That adds to the feeling, Milner is being gifted appearances so he can break the Premier League record.\n\n\"Hurzeler bringing on Milner at Anfield back in December, for example, was clearly done for another tick in the box and a nice reception from the home crowd.\n\n\"The token substitution did not go down well at the time.\"\n\nThere is little doubt that Milner has made some crucial contributions to the teams he has played for over the years.\n\nHe has won multiple Premier League titles with Manchester City and Liverpool, as well as the Champions League with the Reds.\n\nAs he's got older his influence on the pitch has understandably declined and this season he has made 14 Premier League appearances, with 12 of those from off the bench.\n\nHe has scored one goal and provided one assist, but for many of those who have either played alongside him or seen him in action, Milner offers much more than that.\n\n\"He is someone you can rely on,\" former England and Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said.\n\n\"If you have a James Milner in your squad you want to keep hold of him.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Micah Richards added: \"He comes in training every single day.\n\n\"Sometimes you would come in and you want to relax, he was on you: 'Have you done this? Have you done that? What are you eating? What is your diet like?' But it was in a good way.\"\n\nMilner's 14 appearances this season make a total of 310 minutes on the pitch - meaning he is playing an average of 22 minutes per game.\n\nIn each of his last five Premier League appearances he has been sent on in the final 10 minutes, leading some fans to question whether his contribution has been worthwhile.\n\n\"As annoying as it was seeing a 39-year-old come on [against Liverpool] when Brighton had young players on the bench who could have benefited from the experience, at least the Albion were 2-0 down. It had no bearing on the outcome,\" added McCarthy.\n\n\"That was not the case against Fulham. Carlos Baleba had run the midfield with his best performance of the season. If Baleba was tiring, Hurzeler had Jack Hinshelwood on the bench to bring similar energy and drive.\n\n\"Instead, Hurzeler introduced Milner with 81 minutes played. 11 minutes later and Fulham scored their winner from a free-kick conceded in the exact area of the pitch Baleba had defended well all afternoon.\"\n\nThe frustration that some Brighton fans feel about Milner's late appearances off the bench - during which they perceive he offers little - will be compounded by the fact the Seagulls are on a poor run of form - with just one win in their last 12 Premier League games.\n\nJoe: I do not agree with the Milner vanity project. He should be a member of the coaching staff and not a member of the playing squad. We have younger, better options than him.\n\nBrian: Bringing Milner on towards the end of any game affects the balance of the midfield, usually causing unnecessary problems. I think the manager is just giving Milner an opportunity to beat record appearances rather than to improve team.\n\nGraham: Utter nonsense. Milner is brought on to shore up the midfield being a more defensive player and far more experienced than others.\n\nRozzer: Milner has represented the best of professionalism in English football for some time now. He has been a role model to thousands of youngsters in how he conducts himself on and off the pitch and he is deserving of this record. There will always be opportunity for him to do that this season without having too much impact on Albion. Well done Milner.\n\nShould Milner equal Barry's record on Wednesday evening, he will do so having played significantly fewer minutes than Barry did over his career.\n\nIn total, Barry spent 54,439 minutes on the pitch compared to 40,408 for Milner.\n\nHowever, it is about what you do with that time playing and Milner has certainly contributed plenty when he has played - scoring 56 goals and providing 90 assists.\n\nThose are statistics that compare favourably with Barry's record of 53 goals and 64 assists.\n\nMilner's longevity is certainly impressive.\n\nAlmost half the players to have played in the Premier League since it was formed in 1992-93 (5,094) have either played alongside or against Milner.\n\nSince his debut in the 2002-03 campaign, he has faced 99.9% of the 876 other players to have played at least 100 games in the last 24 Premier League seasons.\n\nThe only one of the above who has so far avoided facing Milner is Brentford's Nathan Collins, but that could change when the Bees play Brighton on 21 February.\n\nPlenty of Premier League managers have also become well acquainted with Milner over the decades. Including caretakers, he has made a Premier League appearance under 21 different managers – two more than any other player.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Tottenham sack Thomas Frank as head coach after a run of only two wins in 17 Premier League matches.",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank has been sacked by Tottenham after just under eight months in charge following their dismal 2-1 defeat at home against Newcastle on Tuesday.\n\nSpurs are 16th in the Premier League and just five points above the relegation zone following a dreadful run of form.\n\nThe north London side are winless in their past eight Premier League games - their longest run without a victory since October 2008.\n\nThey have won just two of their past 17 league matches and picked up only 12 points in that time.\n\nTottenham said they had been \"determined to give Frank the time and support needed to build for the future together\", but recent results meant \"a change at this point is necessary\".\n\nFrank took over as head coach in June after Ange Postecoglou was sacked and signed a deal until 2028, but proved unable to notably improve the club's league form despite strong results in European competition.\n\nAgainst a mixed Premier League record of seven wins, eight draws and 11 defeats this season, the Dane led Spurs to automatic qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League by finishing fourth in the group stage.\n\nHowever, they are out of both domestic cup competitions, having been beaten by Newcastle in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup in October and Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round last month.\n\n\"Throughout his time at the club, Thomas has conducted himself with unwavering commitment, giving everything in his efforts to move the club forward,\" Tottenham said.\n\n\"We would like to thank him for his contribution and wish him every success in the future.\"\n\nWhy Frank at Tottenham was a gamble that ended in bitter failure\n\nReaction after Frank sacked as Tottenham boss\n\nWho should Spurs appoint next? Have your say\n\nDespite the loss to Newcastle, Frank still expected to be in charge for the north London derby against Arsenal on 22 February.\n\nAsked by TNT Sports on Tuesday night if his job was under threat, Frank said: \"I spoke to them [the owners] yesterday, so no.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and the easiest thing is to point at me. That's part of the job unfortunately.\n\n\"I will work day and night to turn this around but it is not just one person. There is no doubt we need to improve and I need to be part of that.\"\n\nSpurs were loudly booed after the defeats at home by Newcastle and fellow strugglers West Ham in the past few weeks.\n\nFrank was also taunted by his own fans with chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" during the loss to West Ham and the 2-2 draw at Burnley that followed.\n\nAfter being booed off at half-time while 2-0 down to Manchester City, Frank's side responded to draw 2-2 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nCaptain Cristian Romero was critical of Tottenham's board after that result, calling it \"disgraceful\" that the club only had 11 fit senior players available against City.\n\nThe Argentine then received a straight red card - his second of the season - against Manchester United on 7 February, who went on to win 2-0.\n\nSpurs won five, drew two and lost just one of their eight Champions League group stage matches - that defeat coming away to holders Paris St-Germain.\n\nHowever, their Premier League form has been largely poor since November, including a damaging 4-1 defeat by north London rivals Arsenal and a woeful 3-0 loss at relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest.\n\nLast month Frank said he felt trusted by the board but BBC Sport understands he was already under significant internal scrutiny and at least one member of the club's executive had raised the option of ending his reign.\n\nTottenham took just 10 points at home in the league under Frank, but had a better away record, claiming 19 points from 13 matches on the road.\n\nPrior to joining Tottenham, Frank spent seven years in charge of Brentford, guiding the Bees from the Championship to the Premier League in 2021.\n\nThe 52-year-old's tenure at Spurs started with a Uefa Super Cup defeat on penalties by PSG, with Spurs having booked their place in the match courtesy of winning the Europa League under Australian Postecoglou last season.\n\nTottenham beat Burnley, Manchester City and West Ham in their opening four league games, while also beating Villarreal in the Champions League. But they could not build on that start and Frank's style of play never won over fans.\n\nHe was hampered by extensive injury issues this season though, with Lucas Bergvall, Ben Davies, Richarlison, Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison among those out long term.\n\nSpurs are also without suspended captain Romero for the next three Premier League matches.\n\nFor weeks it has been a case of when, not if, Thomas Frank went, despite the club's ownership and leadership team being determined to give Frank a proper go at turning things round.\n\nUltimately they deemed that, under Frank, Spurs were more likely to career into oblivion than stop the rot.\n\nTottenham were desperate for this appointment to work - they believe Frank is a good manager who was dealt a rough hand.\n\nHowever, the toxicity amongst the fanbase and the meek performances on the pitch meant the club had no option but to act.\n\nMoving forward, an interim appointment until the end of the campaign makes sense, as the managerial landscape will change drastically at the end of the season.\n\nThe most obvious development will be the potential availability of former boss Mauricio Pochettino after the World Cup.\n\nThe USA head coach has made no secret of his desire to return to the club one day and supporters have made clear their wishes for him to return.\n\nIt seems like a perfect match, but Spurs will have to wait until after the World Cup to appoint Pochettino.\n\nAnd if it isn't Pochettino, the likes of Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Marco Silva will be available for nothing in the summer, while World Cup coaches Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Julian Nagelsmann may also be obtainable.\n\nIn the meantime, Tottenham want Frank's immediate successor in place before the players return to training on Monday.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Tottenham manager Thomas Frank insists his job is not under threat despite dropping to five points from the Premier League relegation zone - but will the Dane avoid the sack?",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank insists his job is not under threat at Tottenham Hotspur, despite his side extending their winless run in the Premier League to eight matches.\n\nSpurs suffered their 11th defeat of the season with a 2-1 home loss to Newcastle on Tuesday night.\n\nIt leaves Tottenham, one of six ever-present Premier League clubs in the top flight, five points above the relegation zone.\n\nBut Frank says he has been assured his position as manager is safe.\n\nAsked by TNT Sports if his job is under threat, Frank said: \"I spoke to them [owners] yesterday, so no.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and the easiest thing is to point at me. That's part of the job unfortunately. I will work day and night to turn this around but it is not just one person. There is no doubt we need to improve and I need to be part of that.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about supporters booing at full-time, Frank added: \"I understand the frustration. It has been building up a little bit - last season it was similar playing in Europe and the Premier League.\n\n\"We need to be resilient, mentally and physically. I am 100% sure that it is a team effort, and it is not only one person. We are all aligned and we know what needs to be done.\"\n\nHaving taken 10 points from 15 in their first five Premier League fixtures under Frank, Spurs have managed just 19 from their next 21 matches.\n\nTheir run of eight games without a win is their longest since going nine without victory in 2008 under Juande Ramos - who was sacked with the club bottom of the table.\n\n\"You've got to say what it is and they are in a relegation fight,\" Spurs legend Glenn Hoddle told TNT Sports.\n\n\"The players have to understand that and the fans have to understand that.\n\n\"It is the reality and you have to scrap for every single point.\"\n\nBoos rang around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on the final whistle, while there were pockets of empty seats at kick-off.\n\n\"A lot of fans have lost faith in what Thomas Frank is doing here,\" added former Spurs striker Les Ferdinand.\n\n\"It is desperate times. And desperate times call for desperate measures.\"\n\nThe Tottenham hierarchy now have a huge decision to make.\n\nThomas Frank's future at the club is uncertain. That isn't a secret, of course - it has been the case for weeks.\n\nLarge sections of the supporters want him sacked. The boos that rang round Tottenham Hotspur Stadium at full-time were testament to that prevailing feeling from a disgruntled fanbase.\n\nCrucially, there has been a loss of support towards the Dane internally.\n\nSo, the fact Frank's disastrous first season in charge lurched to deeper depths following this defeat by Newcastle may have significant consequences.\n\nIf Nottingham Forest, who occupy 17th, beat Wolves on Wednesday night they will go level on points with Tottenham.\n\nFrank is understandably hesitant to admit his side are in relegation fight - but the numbers don't lie.\n\nThat said, it may not be Frank's problem for much longer - Tottenham's latest loss will push the beleaguered manager closer to what appears an inevitable exit.\n\nIndeed, such has been the level of contemplation regarding Frank's immediate future at Tottenham in recent weeks that this loss will almost certainly trigger further soul-searching from the club's leadership group.\n\nThe fact the Spurs board have stuck by Frank during such a difficult period proves they want the appointment to work.\n\nThe easier decision would have been to show Frank the door by now.\n\nHowever, the Tottenham hierarchy believe Frank has been dealt a rough hand.\n\nThere's an acknowledgment that the season has been disrupted by multiple injuries to key players.\n\nThere is also recognition that the squad needs repair work - particularly considering the departures of their two main sources of goals in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\n\nThere is also a sense behind the scenes that the squad is lacking in leadership. It was why they signed England international Conor Gallagher and tried to land Andy Robertson from Liverpool - both with plenty of Premier League experience.\n\nThere is also a sense from Tottenham's executive team that the club require a period of managerial stability.\n\nBut by the same token, sources have told BBC Sport that work towards a contingency plan in the event they make a decision they really don't want to make illustrates the precarity of Frank's position.\n\nIf the club decide to part with Frank in the immediate aftermath of this Newcastle defeat, they will have 12 days until their next fixture against Arsenal on 22 February.\n\nThat leaves Tottenham with a prolonged window to execute their replacement plan and leave Frank's successor with time to implement a blueprint for the north London derby.\n\nThe pressure on Frank is at breaking point. We are about to find out if Tottenham crack.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

But those plans are up in smoke - with Frimpong on his third significant injury absence of the season and Bradley not expected to play again until next season owing to a complex knee injury of his own.\n\nTo add to Arne Slot’s woes Joe Gomez has been in and out of the lineup due to injuries and the head coach has been pressed into using Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and even Wataru Endo at right-back.\n\nIt’s very much a problem position for the defending Premier League champions and one which could well be solved in the summer transfer window.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nBecause a report in Sports Boom is now claiming that Liverpool are considering a move for Brentford’s breakout star - Michael Kayode.\n\n“Liverpool are considering a move for Brentford's right-back Michael Kayode,” the report reads.\n\n“The 21-year-old's performances have impressed Reds' boss Arne Slot, as Liverpool face an injury crisis in that position.\n\n“Kayode, who has been a revelation at Brentford, is also being monitored by other Premier League clubs like Manchester United and Newcastle United.”",

Their total of 33 points through 25 matches puts them 10 points back of fifth-place Chelsea, meaning a shot at a Champions League place next year is almost certainly out of the question.\n\nThe Sporting News is following the Tottenham vs. Newcastle match live, providing score updates, commentary, and analysis.\n\nMORE:Busting the myth that Arsenal are \"boring\" with their set-piece focus in the new tactical meta\n\nLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, England)\nReferee: Anthony Taylor\n\nKeep track of every game and every goal via SN's live Premier League scoreboard.\n\nTottenham (3-4-2-1, right to left): Vicario (GK) — Palhinha, Dragusin, Van de Ven — Gray, Gallagher, Sarr, Spence — Odobert, Simons — Solanke.\n\nNewcastle (4-3-3, right to left): Pope (GK) — Trippier, Thiaw, Botman, Hall — Guimaraes, Tonali, Willock — Elanga, Woltemade, Barnes.\n\n📲 Follow The Sporting News on WhatsApp\n\nFollowing the game, this section will be updated with analysis of the Tottenham vs. Newcastle match.\n\n1 hour to kickoff: Let's have a look at the starting lineups. Dan Burn, Jacob Ramsey and Anthony Elanga all come back in for Newcastle, who have Anthony Gordon leading the line and both Yoane Wissa and Nick Woltemade on the bench.\n\nHow we line-up at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this evening 💪 pic.twitter.com/gatlQw67nX\n\n— Newcastle United (@NUFC) February 10, 2026\n\n2 hours to kickoff: For the second straight season, Tottenham are experiencing polar opposite fortunes in Premier League and European competitions. While they sit 15th in the Premier League table 25 matches into Thomas Frank's debut season, they managed to secure a fourth-place finish in the league phase of Champions League action.\n\nThat's key for Frank who now gets room to breathe as they recover their Premier League position, not scheduled to compete in the Round of 16 in Europe until the middle of March. Thanks to their early FA Cup exit, Spurs won't play again after this match until February 22.\n\nWith a debilitatingly long injury list to push through, that extra time will be vital to get the squad back closer to full fitness.\n\nFollowing the game, this section will be updated with post-match reaction from Thomas Frank, Eddie Howe, and players.\n\nMORE:An in-depth rundown of all the latest Tottenham team news and injuries\n\nCristian Romero is suspended for four matches after his red card last time out against Manchester United. His challenge on Casemiro was deemed serious foul play, meaning a three-match ban.

Spence is the only one with a chance to play in this match, while the others need a few more weeks.\n\nLong-term absentees include Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Bergvall and James Maddison, all of whom need until at least April before returning, if not longer.\n\nAnthony Gordon and Lewis Miley are both considered game-time decisions, with the former recovering from a minor hamstring injury and the latter working through a dead leg.\n\nJoelinton will not take part in this match, Eddie Howe confirmed, as he battles back from a groin injury.\n\nTino Livramento, Fabian Schar, and Emil Krafth are also out, with the latter potentially back soon while the other two need significantly more time before returning.\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, England)\n\nCraven Cottage (London, England)\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, England)\n\nVilla Park (Birmingham, England)\n\nChampions League (knockout playoffs — 1st leg)\n\nAzersun Arena (Baku, Azerbaijan)\n\nEtihad Stadium (Manchester, England)",

    "description": "Six months ago a win for Sunderland over the Premier League champions would have felt like pure fantasy, but on Wednesday we could actually do it, and go level on points with them. Let’s get stuck in!",
    "fullText": "Given that Sunderland are so very close to their points target from the start of the season, there’s a feeling — certainly from my perspective, anyway — that this game against Liverpool has slightly more riding on it than your usual Premier League outing.\n\nEvery time someone from within the club is asked about targets and achievable goals this season, there is a very clear and concise point made — all that we are focusing on and thinking about is reaching the magic forty-point mark. Right now we’re sat on 36, so we’re close, but we’re not quite there yet.\n\nThe fact that I’m even considering that we could get within touching distance of that with a win over Liverpool on Wednesday night is telling about how each club has performed this season. Arne Slot’s side, who were clearly the best team in the land last season and won the Premier League, are only three points ahead of us in the table. Victory on Wednesday night would put us level with the reigning Champions. An amazing thought.\n\nOf course, nothing is decided in February, and there’s a long way to go, but can you imagine what a win against such a brilliant side would do for our collective confidence heading into a much kinder-looking run of fixtures?\n\nThe daft thing is, I genuinely believe we can do it. Right now, Liverpool are a wounded animal, and they’ll still be hurting after losing to Manchester City on Sunday in a game they really ought to have gotten something from. Their talisman on that evening, Dominik Szoboszlai, is suspended, and there’s a glaring hole in the right-back position that Sunderland really ought to target and exploit. This is a great opportunity to earn a statement-making win over a side that I wouldn’t have dreamed of us beating six months ago.\n\nWe absolutely have to smell blood. Yes, Sunderland are the last remaining unbeaten Premier League home side, and with that comes the pressure to maintain our glittering spell of form, but you have to think that all the pressure is on Liverpool right now. They’ve got no chance of winning the league and retaining their title, but they’re in serious danger of completely blowing their season altogether. What if the unthinkable happens, and they fail to qualify for Europe? It may seem extreme, but it’s certainly possible, and these are the doubts that will be creeping into the minds of their players and coaching staff. I can’t imagine that after such a morale-sapping loss that they’ll be particularly looking forward to travelling up to the north-east on a Wednesday night to play against a team who has nothing to fear.\n\nMany supporters have quite rightly pointed out that there has been a change in the atmosphere at the Stadium of Light in our last two home games, but I just put that down to the fact that we were playing teams that we were expected to beat. That simply won’t be the case on Wednesday, and I think people will be really up for it against Liverpool, a side who may well not be at their best but are still expected to come and beat us. We thrive off being the underdog, and that brings with it a spirit that enables the fans to find an extra level or two, and should create the foundations for an atmosphere within the stadium that could well carry the players over the line to victory.\n\nEvery tackle, every header, every second ball — we must cheer it ferociously. The players have to do their part too and understand what a strong start early doors can do for how the rest of the game plays out from that point. When we win tackles or stick the ball into row Z for a throw-in, I want to see the Lads roaring towards the crowd and throwing up their arms — let’s make sure that Liverpool know that they’re in for a rough night.\n\nThen, who knows? We could be sat here on Thursday morning, proud as punch of yet another excellent Sunderland performance at the Stadium of Light, level on points with last season’s Champions and just one point away from our first huge target of the campaign.\n\nLet’s believe that we can achieve it. Let’s give them hell.",

Adam Wharton (22), Carlos Baleba (22) and Elliot Anderson (23) are all firm targets, as things stand.\n\nBrighton and Hove Albion’s Baleba was Ruben Amorim’s first choice before his reign came to an end, hence United holding tentative talks with the Cameroonian before 2025/2026 got underway.\n\n(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nNow, however, INEOS will also have to factor in the new manager’s opinion.\n\n“Manchester United have multiple midfielders on their list, and Sandro Tonali is one they’re monitoring,” said Romano on YouTube last night.\n\n“Final decisions depend on the permanent manager and UCL qualification. Amorim’s main target was Baleba.”\n\nAfter matchweek 25, United are well in the mix to secure their UCL spot, boasting a one-point advantage over Chelsea and a five-point lead over Liverpool due to their chaotic defeat to Manchester City on Sunday evening.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE OFFICIAL STRETTY NEWS APP FOR ALL THE LATEST UPDATES & BREAKING NEWS – STRAIGHT TO YOUR PHONE!

    "fullText": "Liverpool spent £450m last summer on new players as Arne Slot and Richard Hughes set about retaining the Premier League title.\n\nAmong the new arrivals were Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak - coming in on British-record deals. Also added was Hugo Ekitike up front - as the head coach and sporting director overhauled the frontline.\n\nSeveral players in attack had to make way to accommodate the new faces - including Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and Ben Gannon-Doak.\n\nThat helped the club towards a figure approaching £200m in sales - but there are signs that another clearout may be on the horizon.\n\nNew faces are coming next summer - with Jeremy Jacquet already secured and a winger set to be announced too. And in order to make space for those arrivals more current Liverpool stars are going to be leaving.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nWe could see the likes of Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah among the departures as Hughes and Slot plot improvements across the squad.\n\nThe Italian, 28, arrived on an initial £10m deal from Juventus back in September 2024. Despite winning the Premier League title the winger has endured a difficult spell on Merseyside - never looking like he was going to decisively win over Slot.\n\nJuventus were heavily linked with a move for their former player in January but that deal ran aground as the Reds were seeking a permanent move rather than a loan.\n\nNow the club’s demands have been set out in a new report from Caught Offside - which claims that Juventus, Napoli and Roma are set to contest the signature of the Italy international.\n\nLiverpool’s price range for a summer deal for Chiesa has now reached between £21 and £26m according to the report.\n\n“The Liverpool board is “open to letting him go”, with doubts about his ability to adapt to the Premier League pace, while Serie A sides are already moving in for Chiesa,” the report reads.\n\nThat is a mammoth sum for a fringe player - and it could represent a clear £16m profit on Chiesa. The Premier League champions are relatively well protected from a transfer fee perspective with the versatile forward contracted until 2028.\n\nBut Hughes needs to be careful that he doesn’t price the £150k per week forward out of a move completely. Chiesa has made just THREE Premier League starts under Slot since arriving at the club at the start of last season.\n\nIt is unlikely that his track record at Anfield is going to attract bids quite that high and so the LFC executive might need to come to a compromise.",

    "fullText": "Thomas Frank says he does not mind fans singing the names of former Spurs players and managers.\n\nThe Dane is under pressure at Tottenham having won just one of his last ten Premier League games and none of the last seven, with Spurs sitting 15th in the table.\n\nBut despite continued criticism from supporters and chants for managers and players of years gone by, Frank says he recognises the achievements of those who came before him.\n\n“I met Mauricio (Pochettino) a few times, a great guy, a great coach,” he said when asked about the fans singing the former Spurs boss’ name at games.\n\n“I think he’s a legend. I don’t think he won a trophy, but for me, he was part of transforming the club, where it was at that stage, to where it ended up being in terms of being close to winning the Premier League title, getting into the Champions League final.\n\n“If you’re close, then you’re very close to winning. Sometimes, you know, that’s football, there’s margins. I think Mauricio has done a top job here and he’s a true legend. If the fans sing their names, it’s well deserved.”\n\nSpurs take on Newcastle in their next Premier League clash as they look to improve their woeful run of form.\n\nBut Frank says he is confident his players are continuing to fight for him despite their results.\n\n“I haven’t seen one Premier League game that the players don’t want to run and fight,” he said.\n\n“So they need to continue it and keep doing what we believe is the right thing, and then it will turn. I’ve never experienced that it will not turn, so I experience it will turn again.\n\n“We can talk about the bottom of the table, or the top of the table, but it’s about the next game.\n\n“I’m fully, fully focused about that. Because there’s also one thing for sure, if you’re too afraid of achieving whatever you want to achieve, you can’t focus, so you just need to focus on your task and need to focus on the next game and do everything you can to win that.\n\n“It’s probably the most competitive Premier League in the five years I’ve been there. So it just makes it very, very difficult every game.”",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on golf superstar Ian Poulter plus the BBC readers and AI with his predictions for this week's midweek Premier League fixtures.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's mental strength was questioned when their previous Premier League title run-ins faltered under Mikel Arteta, but one of their most famous fans feels their mindset will not be an issue this season.\n\nGolf superstar Ian Poulter, renowned for his own rock-solid self-belief and dominant performances under pressure in the Ryder Cup, feels Arteta has that side of things under control.\n\n\"I definitely don't need to give them a pep talk about it,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Mikel has got that nicely covered and they are in the right place. He really backs them up 100%, even if they make mistakes.\n\n\"Some of them have got some scar tissue of not getting over the line in the past but, mentally, you would hope Mikel has got the players more together than ever just by saying 'look you know you are good enough and we now have a deep enough squad, so you have every reason to go into every game more confident than you were before'.\"\n\nYou can watch Poulter play for Majesticks GC, external at the LIV Golf event in Adelaide, Australia from 12-15 February on TNT Sports.\n\nHe is also taking on BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton - as well as the BBC readers and AI - by trying to predict the results of this week's midweek Premier League matches on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nBefore turning to golf, 50-year-old Poulter was a keen footballer and had trials with Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham aged 13.\n\n\"I am so glad that never worked out!\" he explained. \"I had two left feet, and it turned out everyone else Spurs have signed since has got two left feet as well.\n\n\"As soon as I turned 16, my focus was 100% on golf, and every waking minute of the day was about me being my own boss and telling myself that if I worked hard enough I would achieve big things.\n\n\"But I do miss football. I miss the kind of team camaraderie it gave me and I think that's why I've always loved the Ryder Cup as much as I've loved it.\n\n\"It's because that's where I can get the team aspect, the bonding and learning to how to win as a team, as well as the disappointments that come with that as well - I've always loved the dynamic of that extra pressure.\n\n\"Obviously going out to play golf for yourself is fine and you can take the hit if it doesn't work out, but having that the extra weight of playing for your peers and your captain is nice - if you can deal with it.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Ian Poulter were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nLeeds turned Chelsea over at Elland Road in December but they are not the same force away from home and this game smells of Chelsea revenge to me.\n\nThe Blues have made a good start under new boss Liam Rosenior, with four wins out of four in the league. Cole Palmer has hit form too, and they should win this fairly comfortably.\n\nIan's prediction: We annihilated Leeds a few days ago, and could have scored way more than the four we got. Chelsea look pretty solid at the moment too. 3-0\n\nEverton did well to fight back to beat Fulham late on at the weekend, but they could have been more than just a goal down at the break, while Bournemouth were unlucky only to draw with Aston Villa. They peppered Villa's goal with shots.\n\nI am going to go a bit leftfield here because although Everton beat Bournemouth earlier in the season, it was only thanks to a late deflected effort by Jack Grealish.\n\nI usually back Everton at home, and I'm usually wrong... so I am going to do something different this time. I am backing Bournemouth to pinch it.\n\nIan's prediction: It will be close but Everton to take it. 1-0\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 19:30\n\nTottenham captain Cristian Romero let his manager down with his red card against Manchester United, and now he is facing a four-game ban.\n\nIt's fine for Romero to be a motor mouth on social media, calling the club's recruitment \"disgraceful\", but he clearly needs to concentrate on his own game because he has been wild in the challenge again.\n\nFor a manager like Thomas Frank, who is under pressure, that is the last thing you need.\n\nPoor old Eddie Howe is feeling the heat at Newcastle too, though. We had callers in to 606 at the weekend saying it is time for a change - my reaction was 'what!?'.\n\nI really don't get that thinking at all, and not just because Howe's the guy who ended their long wait for a trophy, less than a year ago.\n\nHis squad is stretched now because of the Champions League and their run to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and he also had everything around Alexander Isak's exit to deal with at the start of the season, when it wasn't his doing.\n\nHowe just hasn't been able to replace Isak, either. Yoane Wissa has taken a while to get up and running and Nick Woltemade is very different to Isak in that he likes to come to the ball all the time.\n\nPeople are saying a change of voice might help, but what about backing the guy who has given you so much happiness? I don't understand why you'd want him out.\n\nThis is a very difficult game to predict for various reasons, but we do know Spurs are poor at home and Newcastle aren't great away.\n\nI still think someone will win it, but I am going to sit in the middle anyway, and go for a draw.\n\nIan's prediction: A point apiece. 1-1\n\nBoth of these teams have found a bit of form, and West Ham's victory over Burnley was huge for them in their fight against the drop.\n\nIt seems Manchester United can do no wrong under Michael Carrick, who has often been linked with the West Ham job down the years but goes back to his old club looking for a fifth straight win.\n\nI think he will get it, too. We had some callers into 606 thinking United would be Arsenal's biggest challengers from now on, which seems a stretch, but there is no doubt they are on a bit of a high.\n\nThis is the sort of game where idiots like me can get sucked in and get on the Carrick bandwagon... I am wary, but I am still going to be positive and jump on board too.\n\nIan's prediction: I don't like to say it but United have won their past four games and they have actually looked really good. They have got the bit between their teeth. 0-2\n\nBrighton have only won one of their past 12 league games so the worry for them has to be that they will get sucked into the relegation scrap.\n\nIt was a 4-3 home defeat by Aston Villa in December that was the start of this poor run for Fabian Hurzeler's side, and I don't see it ending at Villa Park.\n\nI'm surprised that the Seagulls are struggling. I looked at their bench against Crystal Palace at the weekend and thought 'blimey, they've got a good squad' but they are underperforming and the fans seem really split on Hurzeler, and have been for a while.\n\nVilla were lucky to get a point against Bournemouth at the weekend and I couldn't believe how Lucas Digne just let Rayan run past him for the Cherries equaliser. He seemed to give up and it was astonishingly bad defending.\n\nUnai Emery's side have lost their past two home league games, against Everton and Brentford, which worries me.\n\nWill it be a hat-trick of home defeats, or will they come good again? I've got to back my old team, so I am going with my heart here and saying Morgan Rogers will make the difference.\n\nIan's prediction: Villa might stumble again. 0-0\n\nCrystal Palace's win over Brighton was a huge result for them and the Eagles are definitely not short of firepower - if anything they have got too many centre-forwards now, but that's a good problem to have.\n\nBurnley have had it though - I thought that before they lost at home to West Ham on Saturday, but there can't be any doubt they are going down now.\n\nI don't think the Clarets will get anything here, either, but their fans seem to have turned on manager Scott Parker which I really don't like.\n\nThis is the guy who got them up but because the other promoted sides, Sunderland and Leeds, are having better seasons, that has gone against him.\n\nJust on the eyes, whenever I've watched them, Burnley have been competitive and have been in games.\n\nI just think there needs to be a bit of patience from their supporters, but of course they are entitled to their opinion.\n\nIan's prediction: Burnley really need a win but they won't get one. 1-0\n\nWas Sunday's late comeback to win at Anfield the game that will spark Manchester City's title bid?\n\nTime will tell, but I am not convinced. I still think the issues that saw City fall behind in the first place will still cost them in future games too.\n\nFair play to Pep Guardiola's side for turning things around with six minutes to go, because their record at Anfield was so poor and a point would not have been enough for them.\n\nBut I just don't see this City team controlling games any\n\nSunday was no different. They were getting mauled in the second half by wave after wave of Liverpool attacks, before the chaos at the end. Gianluigi Donnarumma's save was a big moment and I was delighted that Erling Haaland stuck his penalty away because he's captain of my fantasy team and that gave me a good score.\n\nAs a neutral, I hope the title race lasts until the final few weeks of the season but I just feel like City will drop too many more points before then.\n\nFulham are a good footballing side and almost got something from City at Craven Cottage in December - I was there, and City only just held on for a 5-4 win.\n\nMarco Silva's side have been hard done by in their past couple of games because they had plenty of chances in their defeat at Manchester United, then could have been well ahead at the break before they lost to Everton too.\n\nThis time? Well I think Fulham will score at Etihad Stadium too, and they are due a bit of a break. Maybe they will get it against City, but I am still going for a home win.\n\nIan's prediction: City will win this one. 2-0\n\nI was at Elland Road on Friday and Nottingham Forest were insipid in their defeat by Leeds - they were really flat.\n\nThis is a real pressure game for Forest, and in many ways it is the worst possible fixture for them. Wolves are hopeless so, if Forest win, their fans will say 'well we should be beating them, because they are rubbish'.\n\nLose or even drop points, however, then you can imagine the atmosphere and the mood of the fans, and the pressure that will put on the players.\n\nI don't mean pressure in terms of any calls to sack Forest boss Sean Dyche, but the negativity there will be around the team, when the mood of the fans can be massive when a team is fighting the drop.\n\nLeeds are a great example of that, actually. Just look at the positivity at Elland Road recently and how that has helped Leeds in the past few weeks. It was a very different story when the fans were unhappy earlier in the season.\n\nAs for Wolves, well they are not under any pressure any more.\n\nThey are playing for pride which is totally different to Forest's situation, where every point counts - and this is going to be a nervy night for the home fans at the City Ground.\n\nIan's prediction: Forest to edge it. 1-0\n\nThe Liverpool fans seem to have had enough of Arne Slot, which again makes no sense to me. Just because they aren't going to win the title again doesn't mean they aren't building anything.\n\nIt seems that making the Champions League places is like the title used to be now - as in, if you don't make the Champions League then the manager has got to go. It drives me potty.\n\nI know Sunderland lost at Arsenal on Saturday but I still enjoyed their performance.\n\nThat might sound odd because they were beaten 3-0 but I still thought the Black Cats were competitive, and they were really physical too. They matched Arsenal for long spells of the game.\n\nSo, Liverpool will know what to expect when they try to become the first team to win at Stadium of Light this season, and this is going to be a very difficult game for them.\n\nSlot needs a positive result here, for Liverpool to keep in touch with the teams above them in the race for the top four. My only concern about Sunderland is whether they can bring that same physicality again, but I still don't think Liverpool will win.\n\nIan's prediction: I just have a feeling Liverpool can sneak this one. 1-2\n\nCan Brentford produce another shock after beating Aston Villa and Newcastle in the past couple of weeks? No, they can't.\n\nKeith Andrews has done an incredible job as Bees boss and they will make life difficult for Arsenal because they are well organised and dangerous on the break.\n\nBut I still think Arsenal will win because of their sheer power that means they can run through anything.\n\nThis might not be the most entertaining game to watch, because Brentford will sit in and defend, and counter.\n\nArsenal will deal with that, and then find a way of scoring. A deflected goal will probably decide it.\n\nPeople might say the way they win games is not pretty but there is still a lot to admire about Arsenal and, in the end, no matter what anyone says, it is all about winning, isn't it?\n\nArsenal are very good at winning games, and I am expecting them to win this one too. In my opinion, they will go on and win the title too, because of the quality of their squad and how good they are defensively.\n\nAs much as you want beauty to triumph over a beast, City are still far too flaky for that to happen.\n\nIan on Arsenal's title hopes: I feel pretty confident, even with the couple of slip-ups we've had in the past month. We've got the strength in depth we need where other players can step up when we are missing players through injury.\n\nIf Viktor Gyokeres can start filling the onion bag up and Bukayo Saka can bag a few as well then that would be nice, but we look so good from set-pieces anyway. Our scoring stats from open play could be a bit of an issue but as long as we are scoring and winning then it doesn't really matter.\n\nIan's prediction: This is going to be a non-stressful win. We will be 2-0 up, concede a stupid goal but then finish the game off. 1-3\n\nChris and AI both got four correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week 25, giving them a total of 40 points apiece.\n\nHis guest, Gladiators star Apollo, was right about Manchester City's win at Anfield [everyone else went for a 2-2 draw] and ended up on 70 points thanks to four correct results including one exact score.\n\nBut the win went to the collective efforts of the BBC readers, with five correct results and one exact score [Bournemouth's 1-1 draw with Aston Villa] for a tally of 80 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s summer rebuild is already taking shape and, as reported by The Telegraph, Sandro Tonali has surged high on the club’s shortlist to replace Casemiro. It is a signal of intent from Old Trafford, a move that would blend long term planning with immediate competitive ambition.\n\nUnited’s need is obvious. Casemiro’s confirmed summer departure removes not only experience but also tactical security from the engine room. For a side still searching for rhythm, control, and authority in central areas, recruitment here will define the next phase of the project.\n\nTonali, 25, represents both pedigree and Premier League adaptation, a rare combination in a volatile market.\n\nUnited’s interest in Tonali sits within a broader scouting framework. Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are also under consideration, while previous inquiries into Brighton’s Carlos Baleba underline the club’s desire for athletic, progressive midfielders.\n\nYet Tonali’s profile stands apart.\n\nThree seasons in England have hardened his tactical awareness. Newcastle’s £55m investment in 2023 now looks modest in an era where Enzo Fernández, Moisés Caicedo and Declan Rice all commanded fees beyond £100m. Newcastle would expect similar territory for Tonali, particularly given his contract running to 2029.\n\nThere is risk attached, notably his betting ban earlier in his Premier League spell, but United appear focused on the footballer rather than the controversy.\n\nTransfer narratives rarely ignite without agent intervention and Giuseppe Riso’s remarks have ensured this story gathers pace.\n\n“Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,” Riso said.\n\nHe added, “We’ll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later. We’ll see how the season ends and then we’ll decide what to do.”\n\nPerhaps most telling was the ambiguity, “There’s no preference. It’s still early. What we’re saying today won’t apply tomorrow.”\n\nSuch language keeps every elite suitor engaged, Juventus, Manchester City, Arsenal, and now United most prominently.\n\nEuropean qualification may ultimately shape Tonali’s future. Newcastle sit 12th in the Premier League and face Qarabag in a Champions League play off, their route back to the competition remains uncertain.\n\nRiso acknowledged the emotional tie, stating, “Newcastle couldn’t let him go now, and there’s no point moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.”\n\nAttachment, though, often bends under competitive gravity. Tonali wants Champions League football. United believe they can offer it, or at least return to it swiftly.\n\nFrom a strategic lens, this pursuit feels calculated. Tonali is entering his peak years, already Premier League tested, tactically disciplined, and technically secure under pressure. He would not merely replace Casemiro, he would recalibrate United’s midfield identity.\n\nFrom a Manchester United supporter’s perspective, this report lands somewhere between excitement and caution.\n\nTonali is undeniably elite. His tempo control, positional intelligence, and ability to dictate transitions would address long standing midfield imbalances. United have too often lacked composure in high leverage matches, particularly against top six rivals. Tonali would change that dynamic.\n\nYet £100m territory demands scrutiny. Fans will remember recent midfield spending sprees across the league and question value versus urgency. Is Tonali transformative, or simply premium stabilisation.\n\nThere is also squad context. When Casemiro departs, United require not one midfielder but two, possibly three, depending on outgoings. Investing heavily in a single profile could restrict broader rebuild flexibility.\n\nStill, the upside is compelling. Tonali offers leadership without theatrics, control without slowing play, and durability in England’s most demanding fixtures.\n\nIf United are serious about restoring midfield authority, this is the calibre required. The question is not quality, it is whether the club can align finance, Champions League qualification, and long term squad architecture around one decisive signing.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): Huge save at 2-1 to keep Manchester City ahead in their win at Liverpool. This is why they bought him in - he's the guy to make big saves. He commanded his area really, really well. He wasn't able to keep a clean sheet but that was because arguably the goal of the season got put past him. He was fantastic.\n\nJayden Bogle (Leeds): Excellent going forward, he has played a number of positions this season for the team but I thought he was excellent in the 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest. He was a real outlet down that right side which is obviously huge for them and a massive three points for being safe and staying up.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City) and Axel Disasi (West Ham): Both of them have had an instant impact when they've come into the team. Disasi has to defend a bit deeper at West Ham - big, organised, putting his body on the line. He gives them a physical presence they've missed.\n\nMarc was a little lucky with the Mohamed Salah pullback - to still be on the pitch. But his leadership experience for Abdukodir Khusanov was exceptional. The level of confidence he gives this Manchester City backline is huge. Him hitting the ground running was exceptional for them.\n\nEl Hadji Malick Diouf (West Ham): Wonderful cross for the goal in the win at Burnley. He's been sensational since he came back from the Africa Cup of Nations. He's really added pace, power and a little bit of bite they have been missing down that side. He didn't have a great start to the season but we're starting to see the full potential of him now.\n\nVitaly Janelt (Brentford): He obviously gets a goal - wonderful header - but I actually thought he was just the best player on the pitch in the 3-2 win at Newcastle. I agree with Jordan Henderson in the sense he should have had the man of the match but he played well, kept it simple, broke up the game, broke forward when he needed to. A real solid midfielder's performance.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): What a difference a manager makes - being able to be free, get on the ball, go wherever he wants and be creative. I think Michael Carrick takes a lot of credit for that but again, another goal for him against Spurs, another win for United - he has to go in.\n\nRayan (Bournemouth): He was fantastic in the draw with Aston Villa. We have to look at Lucas Digne defensively but everything he did, running forward with pace, power, direct. He caused problems throughout the day. He's a big strong boy that gets his team up the pitch and he gets at the opposition - and Digne had no answers for him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): We're going to put him in the 10 even though he played right-back, but when you score a goal like that you're in. Unbelievable free-kick against Manchester City with pure technique to slice across the ball to make it swing from left to right and leave Donnarumma stranded.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): His first start back under Liam Rosenior, talking about getting his fitness back up. He loses a few points because he was against a very bad Wolves team. However fantastic, a hat-trick, goals, penalties, confidence. The most important thing is he's smiling again - that's great for Chelsea and great for England so he deserves that, as does Rosenior for giving him that.\n\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): I don't normally give subs the opportunity to start but Gyokeres to be fair came on at 60 minutes against Sunderland and scored two goals to get Arsenal over the line. Strong from him. Maybe having Jesus and Havertz around is going to bring out the best from him from a competitive point of view. But it's a fantastic day for him and a fantastic day for Arsenal.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): Huge, huge result for him at Anfield. His changes influence the game, and I think with Arsenal winning it's do or die and City put in a solid performance. Still wobbly, still a few question marks but they got the result which is all that matters.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "A generation of Manchester City supporters had not experienced a winning feeling at Anfield - but all that changed on a highly dramatic Sunday evening.\n\nTrailing 1-0 to Liverpool in the 84th minute, it was turning into a theme familiar for the Citizens faithful until captain Bernardo Silva and the ice-cool Erling Haaland both netted in the dying stages to hand Pep Guardiola's side a memorable victory.\n\nCity supporters were riotous when Rayan Cherki rolled in a third into an empty net from just inside his own half, but the goal was eventually ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR).\n\nIt mattered little as they stayed well after the final whistle to celebrate their side's triumph - only a third in the league since 1981.\n\nIt was also result that keeps City in the title race. Just.\n\nBoss Pep Guardiola joked afterwards about their last victory at Anfield five years ago, which came behind closed doors during Covid restrictions, saying: \"That doesn't count, right?\"\n\nBut this brilliant turnaround meant City are only six points adrift of leaders Arsenal with 13 games left to play - including a Gunners visit to Etihad Stadium in April - having been staring at a nine-point deficit in the closing stages.\n\n\"It is so difficult, Anfield is Anfield - the tradition, the history and the crowd,\" added Guardiola. \"It always looks smaller, tighter here and the pitch doesn't look like Etihad Stadium - and the players that they have, and everything.\n\n\"Of course we would be disappointed and all the questions would be over and over [about the title race] but six points is better than nine. It is still a lot considering how strong Arsenal are in all departments.\n\n\"The last 10 games, from my experience, it is so difficult. The important thing is to try to be there and improve because the second half was not good enough again.\n\n\"All we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal and being there, try if they go slip [up] and use it.\"\n\n'Killjoy' - did VAR get late drama in Liverpool v Man City right?\n\nPremier League: Man City fight back to beat Liverpool as Szoboszlai sent off in dramatic finish\n\nThe City substitutes piling over to their fans after Cherki's goal showed how much the victory meant to them - one supporter even got carried away and jumped on to the pitch before being led away by stewards.\n\nIt was an incredible conclusion to an engrossing encounter, one that has repeatedly delivered drama in Guardiola's past tussles with Jurgen Klopp and now Arne Slot.\n\nThese two sides have been the only teams to lift the Premier League trophy over the past eight years and, while reigning champions Liverpool have fallen away this term and sit in sixth place, City are clinging on.\n\n\"What can this do to Manchester City confidence-wise, going forward?\" said former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's all about putting runs together at this stage and that is a massive result that can give them a huge confidence boost.\n\n\"They might well just - and I mean just - be in this.\"\n\nAfter their 3-0 win at Etihad Stadium earlier in the season, City achieved a league double over Liverpool for the first time since the 1936-37 campaign.\n\n\"It's an important one for City today,\" former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney told BBC Sport. \"It's a tough place to go, Anfield.\n\n\"I thought Liverpool were really good in the second half, City were really good first half - then City have gone a goal down and dug in to get the three points.\"\n\nFormer United defender Gary Neville added: \"Will this give them the bit between the teeth? Will this give them the confidence to go and chase down Arsenal?\n\nCity captain Silva started the game after recovering from a recent hamstring issue and was the catalyst for his side's comeback by prodding in the equaliser from a Haaland knockdown.\n\nThe Portuguese has now played more game against Liverpool (16) than any other City player, while his three goals at Anfield makes him City's joint-top scorer at the stadium alongside Nicolas Anelka and Ilkay Gundogan.\n\nHaaland, by contrast, scored a first goal at Anfield with his winning penalty in the third minute of added time.\n\n\"I feel the whole team knew before the game if we lost it then the title race was probably over,\" said Silva. \"We felt like we needed to win.\n\n\"The hope is there and we are going to fight until the end. We need to keep doing our job that we haven't lately.\"\n\nOn Sunday, no player ran more than Silva's 12.84km, while no City player made more passes in the final third than his 24, nor did they attempt more dribbles than his four.\n\nEarlier this season, Guardiola said he has a \"weakness\" for the 31-year-old and a player he \"loves\" very much.\n\nSilva is out of contract in the summer and the City boss added: \"He is one of the best players I have every trained with.\n\n\"He is the perfect captain. It is a joy for me as a manager to have him. The team comes first.\n\n\"His contribution is massive and he is one of the legends of this club.\"",

    "fullText": "Liverpool’s preparations for a crucial Premier League showdown with Manchester City have been shaped by a blend of returning fitness, lingering absences and tactical adjustments. With Arne Slot seeking momentum in the second half of the campaign, the Reds’ predicted lineup and injury latest remain under close scrutiny.\n\nLiverpool have received a timely boost in defence, even as several key figures remain unavailable. The latest updates provide insight into how Slot is likely to shape his side for one of the defining fixtures of the season.\n\nJoe Gomez of Liverpool takes selfies with fans in the stands Liverpool v Crystal Palace, Premier League,\n\nLiverpool’s medical department has been busy in recent weeks, managing a congested fixture list and several long-term concerns. The most significant positive development is the return of Joe Gomez to first-team contention following a hip issue, offering Slot valuable depth across the back line.\n\nHowever, Jeremie Frimpong remains sidelined with a groin injury sustained earlier in the campaign, while Alexander Isak, Conor Bradley and Giovanni Leoni continue their respective recovery programmes. Their absence limits Liverpool’s options, particularly in wide defensive areas, where rotation has been restricted.\n\nThe Evening Standard reported that Gomez’s availability “has come at no better time” as Liverpool look to push towards the European places. This assessment reflects the broader picture: Slot is gradually regaining personnel, but the squad is still operating below full capacity.\n\nFitness management has become central to Liverpool’s approach this season. With high-intensity pressing still a feature of Slot’s philosophy, careful workload monitoring has influenced recent team selections and substitution patterns.\n\nLiverpool’s defensive structure is expected to remain largely consistent for the Manchester City fixture. Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are set to continue their partnership at centre-back, providing physical presence and leadership against one of the league’s most dynamic attacks.\n\nAt right-back, Dominik Szoboszlai is likely to deputise once again in the absence of Frimpong. The Hungarian’s adaptation to the role has been one of the quieter success stories of recent weeks, combining energy with tactical discipline.\n\nOn the left side, Milos Kerkez is favoured to start, although Andy Robertson remains an alternative depending on match demands. Slot has rotated between the two in recent fixtures, balancing experience with athleticism.\n\nThis defensive unit reflects Liverpool’s current priorities: stability, positional awareness and controlled build-up. Against a City side known for exploiting half-spaces, maintaining compactness between full-backs and centre-backs will be essential.\n\nIn midfield, Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch are expected to retain their places as the double pivot. Their complementary profiles have brought greater balance, with Mac Allister dictating tempo and Gravenberch offering ball-carrying power.\n\nCurtis Jones remains in contention after a run of regular minutes, but current indications suggest continuity will be preferred for such a high-stakes encounter. Slot has consistently stressed the importance of rhythm and cohesion in central areas.\n\nAhead of them, Mohamed Salah, Florian Wirtz and Cody Gakpo are likely to operate in advanced roles, supporting Hugo Ekitike as the central striker. Ekitike’s recent brace against Newcastle reinforced his growing importance, particularly in matches requiring physical presence and pressing intensity.\n\nThis attacking configuration is designed to combine directness with creativity. Wirtz’s ability to operate between the lines, Salah’s wide threat and Gakpo’s movement offer multiple routes to goal, while Ekitike provides a focal point.\n\nBased on current fitness reports and recent selections, Liverpool’s predicted lineup is expected to be:\n\nAlisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike.\n\nThis XI reflects both necessity and intent. Injuries have narrowed the pool, but Slot has settled on a core group capable of executing his tactical framework under pressure.\n\nThe original Evening Standard analysis highlights how Liverpool’s recent win over Newcastle has boosted confidence ahead of this fixture. That result, combined with incremental improvements in squad availability, has created cautious optimism within the camp.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, this lineup prioritises pressing coordination, transitional speed and defensive resilience. Against Manchester City, margins are fine, and Liverpool’s ability to manage possession without losing intensity will be decisive.\n\nWith the race for European qualification tightening, every point carries increased significance. This match represents not only a test of Liverpool’s current form, but also an indicator of how far Slot’s project has progressed.\n\nIf key players remain fit and the defensive unit continues to stabilise, Liverpool’s predicted lineup could provide the foundation for a strong finish to the campaign.",

    "description": "Supra du Quebec kick off their inaugural Canadian Premier League in April and will field only players born or raised in the province.",
    "fullText": "Rocco Placentino stood in front of Supra du Quebec's players, coaches and club management ready to deliver a speech before the club's first ever training session.\n\nAs the club's co-founder and president tried to find the words, he became emotional looking at what had been created and what was staring back at him.\n\nFormer Canada international Placentino saw a group of players and coaches all born or raised in Quebec, Canada.\n\nThey had been brought together, inspired by Bilbao's Athletic Club, to help put the only French-speaking province in Canada on the footballing landscape.\n\n\"It's done with local pride, local players, local staff, local upper management and local partnerships,\" said Placentino of Supra, who continue their pre-season preparation on Sunday before competing in the Canadian Premier League.\n\n\"Although it's not only talking about it but putting it into action, which we are doing. It's real, it's not a myth, it's not a fiction. It's truth, it's happening and we're extremely proud about this.\"\n\nPlacentino was raised in Montreal and played for Quebec's other professional football team, Major League Soccer side CF Montreal, as well as having spells in Italy's second and third divisions.\n\nWhile Montreal throw their scouting net across the world to be competitive, FC Supra are focusing on local players who may have overlooked.\n\nThey want to give other players from Quebec the chance to try and emulate Canadian internationals such as Saussolo's Ismael Kone and Nice's Moise Bombito.\n\nBombito was born in Montreal, while Kone moved to the city from the Ivory Coast aged seven, and their journeys highlight the rich cultural mix and football obsession found in Quebec.\n\n\"The objective is to have a local pride program in the Canadian Premier League, a team that could furnish players that are local and multicultural,\" said Placentino.\n\n\"I look at countries like Belgium and Iceland. If they're able to build players and sell them worldwide to become phenom footballers, why can't we do it in Quebec?\n\n\"A lot of players would fall through the cracks here and miss out on opportunities to shine and to be exposed at a higher level.\n\n\"All we need to do is take these ballers, put them in an environment that is very professional but also keeping that DNA of being street ballers.\"\n\nA unique touch showcasing Supra's pride in their province is having the Quebec flag printed on their kits.\n\nPaul Desbaillets, Supra's chief branding officer, says the aim was to bring Quebec's unique character to life.\n\n\"There's always been a history of Quebec versus Canada,\" he said.\n\n\"What makes us so proud exactly at this club is that here is more proof of why this province is so spectacular. We are a complete mix of French, Italian, British, Moroccan, Persian and Asian.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what ethnicity. We've formed together around Supra first and that's our melting pot of what Quebec is.\"\n\nSupra du Quebec may be a new club, that are yet to play a competitive game, but the idea of the club colours and name all stemmed from one of Montreal's first football teams.\n\nSupra Montreal only operated between 1988 and 1992, but provided the environment for a six-year-old Placentino to form some of his earliest footballing memories.\n\n\"I remember going to games with my father and watching players that were mainly local players playing for Supra Montreal,\" he said.\n\n\"I loved the colours. I loved the blue, white, and red.\n\n\"And I said, 'You know what? I want to relive that experience as now a founder of this club and bring back that local pride and that Quebec feeling'. We wanted to relive it and modernise it the best way we could.\"\n\nAlong with the colours and name, there is a more personal link between the two clubs through one of their new players, Alessandro Biello.\n\nWhat makes the 19-year-old's signing so special is that his dad, Mauro, played for the original Supra and captained Placentino while they played together at CF Montreal.\n\n\"When we signed [Alessandro] Biello every box was checked in terms of what we were looking for,\" said Placentino.\n\n\"The work ethic, bleeding for the colours, bleeding for the city, playing in front of his family and friends, having that drive to do well with the Supra, so that maybe one day he could be sold to a team in Europe.\n\n\"So for us it's a very proud moment to have Mauro's son play for Supra and hopefully he follows in his father's footsteps.\"\n\nQuebec is home to roughly nine million people. To represent FC Supra a player or coach has to have been born, raised or have a deep connection to the state.\n\nThis transfer policy is similar to Athletic Club's Basque-only approach, with Placentino hoping to visit the Spanish side to understand how growing a club using this transfer policy is possible.\n\nThe Supra president has already discovered some positives and negatives to running a policy like this, with the former Canada international having to reject more than 150 offers from players who had no connection to Quebec.\n\nBut despite a focus on growing local talent, there has also been interest from athletes who have moved away from Quebec to all corners of the globe but are keen to get involved with Supra.\n\n\"There are players who play in Guatemala, in Finland, in Iceland, in Sweden, in Malta that are all Quebec-based players and are saying, 'I want to come home',\" explained Placentino.\n\n\"They can't wait to come home and when you hear that, I get goosebumps.\"\n\nThis feelings of the players, coaches and management are shared by Placentino, which is why the club's motto is so poignant.\n\n\"Un club d'ici, pour ici.\" It translates to \"A club from here, for here.\"",

    "fullText": "Liverpool host Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday while aiming to secure a second consecutive Premier League victory.\n\nThe Reds have moved into second place following their emphatic 4–1 win over Newcastle United. Manager Arne Slot oversaw a return to form for his attacking unit. Hugo Ekitiké was instrumental in that win. He currently averages a goal contribution every 112 minutes. Liverpool boast an incredible home record against City, losing just once in their last 22 meetings at Anfield. A win today would significantly close the gap on league leaders Arsenal.\n\nArne Slot manages a squad coping with several notable absences in the defensive and attacking lines. Notably, Jeremie Frimpong is ruled out with a thigh injury. Alexander Isak also remains on the treatment table. Consequently, Dominik Szoboszlai could start at right-back to provide defensive cover. Florian Wirtz enters the match in scintillating form, boasting nine goal involvements in his last 11 games.\n\nAlisson Becker will start in goal behind a defensive pairing of Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk. Miloš Kerkez is expected to keep his place at left-back. In midfield, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister will anchor the side. Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo will support Ekitiké from wide areas. Liverpool have earned 28 points from losing positions since the start of last season. Their resilience will be vital against the champions.\n\nLiverpool predicted XI: Alisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Anfield on Sunday, 8 February 2026.

    "fullText": "Anfield plays host to the definitive “main event” of Premier League gameweek 25 this Sunday as Liverpool and Manchester City renew a rivalry that has defined the modern era of English football.\n\nFor Pep Guardiola’s side, the trip to Merseyside is a high-stakes mission to stay within touching distance of league leaders Arsenal. The Citizens could find themselves nine points adrift by kick-off. Consequently, a victory at a ground where they historically struggle is almost non-negotiable. Liverpool appear to be emerging from a difficult winter slump. Arne Slot’s men rediscovered their “killer instinct” with a dominant 4–1 dismantling of Newcastle United last weekend. Sunday’s clash promises a high-octane tactical battle where neither side can afford to blink.\n\nLast Meeting: Manchester City 3–0 Liverpool (9 Nov 2025), Premier League\n\nArne Slot confirmed that Joe Gomez (hip) has a slight chance of making the matchday squad. However, the Reds will be without Jeremie Frimpong (thigh), who was ruled out earlier this week. Liverpool’s injury list also includes Conor Bradley, Alexander Isak, and Giovanni Leoni. On a positive note, Florian Wirtz enters the game in scintillating form. He boasts nine goal involvements in his last 11 appearances.\n\nPep Guardiola remains uncertain regarding the availability of captain Bernardo Silva. In better news, Rúben Dias returned to the bench midweek following a month-long layoff. John Stones has also resumed first-team training. Marc Guéhi is available after being ineligible for the EFL Cup. Erling Haaland is expected to return to the starting lineup after being rested as a substitute against Newcastle.\n\nThe Reds have made Anfield a fortress against today’s visitors. Notably, Liverpool have lost just one of their last 22 Premier League home games against Manchester City. They recently rediscovered their scoring touch in the dominant win over Newcastle. Hugo Ekitiké is proving to be a revelation this term. He averages a goal or assist every 112 minutes, the best debut-season ratio for a Liverpool player since Mohamed Salah.\n\nCity arrive with a strange statistical anomaly in 2026. Notably, they have not conceded a single first-half goal this year. However, they are also the only side yet to score a second-half goal, conceding six in that period. Rayan Cherki remains their primary creative hub, creating three chances per 90 minutes. Notably, Anfield remains one of only two grounds where Erling Haaland has played but never scored.\n\nLiverpool Predicted XI: Alisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike\n\nManchester City Predicted XI: Donnarumma; Nunes, Guehi, Ake, Ait-Nouri; Rodri, O’Reilly; Cherki, Reijnders, Semenyo; Haaland\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League, and Sky Ultra HD. Coverage starts at 16:00 GMT. Fans can also stream the action via the Sky Go app.\n\nRead more- Thomas Frank ‘proud’ of 10-man Spurs following Man Utd defeat\n\nSee Also- Bruno Fernandes sends Man Utd message as winning run continues\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace travel to the South Coast on Sunday, aiming to end a dismal nine-match winless run in the Premier League.\n\nThe Eagles have moved into a precarious position, sitting 15th and on the brink of the relegation zone. Manager Oliver Glasner oversees a side that has struggled for goals recently. Palace have underperformed their Expected Goals (xG) by over eight goals since mid-December. However, they remain resilient in derbies, having drawn seven of their last 13 meetings with Brighton. A result today is vital to ease mounting pressure on the squad.\n\nOliver Glasner manages a squad bolstered by the return of its primary midfield anchor. Notably, Adam Wharton is available to start after serving a one-match suspension. However, Eddie Nketiah is set to miss out through injury. Consequently, the manager is expected to rely on Ismaïla Sarr to provide the goals. Sarr has nine goals this season and scored twice on his last visit to the Amex.\n\nDean Henderson will start in goal behind a defensive back three featuring Maxence Lacroix. Daniel Muñoz and Tyrick Mitchell will provide the width from wing-back positions. In midfield, Wharton will partner Will Hughes to provide defensive stability. Yeremy Pino and Brennan Johnson will support Sarr in a flexible front three. Palace must find a clinical edge to avoid becoming the league’s lowest scorers since Matchday 16.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Richards, Lacroix, Riad; Munoz, Hughes, Wharton, Mitchell; I. Sarr, Pino, Johnson\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the American Express Stadium on Sunday, 8 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 14:00 GMT.\n\nUK fans can watch the match live on Sky Sports Main Event. Coverage begins one hour before kick-off on television and the Sky Go app.\n\nRead more- Thomas Frank ‘proud’ of 10-man Spurs following Man Utd defeat\n\nSee Also- Bruno Fernandes sends Man Utd message as winning run continues\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Chelsea striker Liam Delap is reportedly now playing for his future at the club in the second half of this Premier League season.\n\nDelap has been struggling at the club since he arrived from Ipswich Town in the summer transfer window. As well as with his form on the pitch, he has struggled with injuries off it too.\n\nI think Delap is a decent striker, but I’m starting to wonder whether he might just suit a team that plays on transition rather than possession based. He seems to be really struggling with Chelsea’s style of play. But maybe he can grow into it and get used to it a bit more? Well, apparently he has half a season to prove he can, otherwise Chelsea are looking to sell him…\n\nLiam Delap with Liam Rosenior in training. (Photo by Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC)\n\nLiam Delap’s former suitors are keeping a very close eye on developments at Stamford Bridge, with TEAMtalk reporting that the striker is effectively playing for his Chelsea future in the second half of the campaign.\n\nManchester United, Newcastle United and Everton all pushed hard for his signature before his move to Stamford Bridge, and all three clubs are apparently monitoring the situation closely should Chelsea decide to listen to offers. The report goes on to say that other clubs such as Brighton and Sunderland are also watching.\n\nChelsea beat Wolves 3-1 yesterday afternoon in their latest Premier League game, effectively winning the game in the first half by scoring all three of their goals to put it out of reach for the home side.\n\nCole Palmer was the hat-trick hero of the day, getting all three of Chelsea’s goals in the first half to announce himself fully back and ready for the rest of the campaign.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City take on Liverpool at Anfield today in what is a massive Premier League fixture. When City play Liverpool, it is one of the biggest Premier League fixtures of the season. Today’s match is no exceptionn, especially for Pep Guardiola’s side. City enter today’s match nine points behind Arsenal, who sit clear at the top of the Premier League. Manchester City have to beat Liverpool today at a ground where they typically don’t play well to keep in touch with Mikel Arteta’s side.\n\nHere is the latest Manchester City injury and team news, and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of today’s match.\n\nOn the injury front, Josko Gvardiol, Savinho, Mateo Kovacic and Jeremy Doku will all miss today’s match. The quartet have all been ruled out of the crucial Premier League fixture at Anfield. Bernardo Silva is also in doubt for today’s match. The City captain missed Manchester City’s win over Newcastle due to a hamstring injury. Pep Guardiola confirmed on Friday that Bernardo Silva is in doubt for today’s match.\n\nIn good news for City, Ruben Dias has trained all week and is available to play against Liverpool. It remains to be seen if he will start at Anfield. With Bernardo Silva in doubt for today’s match, Pep Guardiola may prefer to start Dias given the leadership that the Portuguese international provides. John Stones has finally returned to training after a lengthy injury layoff, but today’s match has likely come too soon for Stones to play any part.\n\nMarc Guehi is available to play today. Guehi was ineligible for Manchester City’s Carabao Cup semi-final second-leg tie against Newcastle.",
