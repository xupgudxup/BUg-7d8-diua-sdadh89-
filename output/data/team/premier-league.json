    "fullText": "Liverpool have become the top-earning Premier League club for the first time, according to analysis from financial firm Deloitte.\n\nThe Reds won the English top-flight title last season and generated 836m euros (£702m) - more revenue than any other English side.\n\nManchester United fell to their lowest ever position in what is the 29th edition of the Deloitte Football Money League.\n\nReal Madrid again top the list with a 1.2bn euro (£1.01bn) revenue, despite not winning the Champions League or La Liga last season, as both Manchester clubs dropped down the list.\n\nBarcelona were second, moving back into the top three for the first time since 2019-20 after generating 975m euros (£819m), despite playing away from their Nou Camp stadium last season as it was renovated.\n\nBayern Munich are third on 861m euros (£723m), Champions League winners Paris St-Germain fourth on 837m euros (£703m) and Liverpool fifth.\n\nManchester City dropped from second to sixth with a revenue of 829m euros (£697m).\n\nManchester United, who finished 15th in the Premier League and were beaten by Tottenham in the Europa League final, went from fourth to eighth with 793m euros (£666m).\n\nUnited have topped the money league on 10 occasions, most recently in 2017.\n\nTheir matchday revenue will also suffer this season as they are not involved in European competition and have been knocked out of the FA Cup and League Cup at the first hurdle.\n\n\"If you went back 10 or 15 years, and you looked at Manchester United's matchday revenue it was the industry leader,\" said Deloitte Sports Business Group lead partner Tim Bridge.\n\n\"If you looked at their ability to generate commercial revenue, it was the benchmark by which everybody then went to market and set their strategy. I don't think that remains the case.\"\n\nThere are six English clubs in the top 10, with Arsenal (822m euros, £690m) in seventh, Tottenham (673m euros, £565m) in ninth and Chelsea 10th with 584m euros (£491m).\n\nThree other English sides made the top 20, with Aston Villa (450m euros, £378m) 14th, Newcastle United (400m euros, £335m) 17th and West Ham United (276m euros, £232m) in 20th.",

    "fullText": "Former Premier League striker Thierry Henry has urged Manchester United to sort out one key thing before they seal the appointment of a new permanent boss.\n\nTwo weeks ago, United confirmed the sacking of Ruben Amorim after 14 months in charge as head coach.\n\nAmorim’s spell was littered with instability as he struggled to implement his controversial 3-4-2-1 system. His departure was ultimately triggered by conflicts with certain players and decisively, with the club leadership, particularly director of football Jason Wilcox.\n\nMichael Carrick was brought in to serve as caretaker boss until the end of the season.\n\nThe United legend enjoyed a dream start to life, leading the club to a dominant 2-0 victory over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. The result catapulted the Red Devils to fifth place in the top-flight standings and firmly in the frame for a top-four finish with 16 games left to play.\n\nUnited are expected to make a permanent appointment in the summer, having considered all their options.\n\nSome of the coaches who have been linked to the Old Trafford hot seat are Roberto De Zerbi, Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola, Luis Enrique, Julian Nagelsmann and Thomas Tuchel.\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports, Henry strongly urged United to first determine what direction they want to go before picking the new boss.  Since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, United have experimented with managers of varying tactical styles, personalities, and temperaments, yet none have succeeded in restoring the club to its former glory.\n\nHenry said [as quoted by the Daily Mail], “The reality is what do they want Man United to be. What do they want, I don’t feel it from the outside. I don’t feel whatever they are looking at.”\n\n“Bayern went to get Vincent Kompany, we talked about Luis Enrique, we talked about Frank Rijkaard (at Barcelona).”\n\n“You can agree of disagree, you can see what type of coaches they want. I don’t know at Man United, I really don’t know what they are about now, what they want to achieve and what is the DNA. I am talking about now when I watch the games. What Michael Carrick did at the weekend was brilliant, but in two weeks we could be talking about something else.”\n\nHenry added, “What do they want, how are they going to go about it? It should be clear in order to get one of the guys we are talking about.”\n\n“The way they [Barcelona] see it on the other side, if you don’t fit who the house is, it doesn’t matter who you are or what you have done before.”\n\n“If you fit what we believe in, you can come. But what are you to make that decision.”\n\nOn whether Carrick should be considered for the position, Henry asserted that if he performs well, he should be considered for the position.\n\nfeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Premier League referees' boss Howard Webb has rejected claims that his officials made a mistake by not sending off Diogo Dalot in Saturday's Manchester derby.\n\nDalot was booked in the 11th minute of Manchester United's 2-0 win over Manchester City for a high challenge on Jeremy Doku.\n\nThe Portugal international had closed down Doku and stretched out a leg to try to intercept the ball. He made contact with his studs on the knee of the winger.\n\nThe video assistant referee (VAR), Craig Pawson, supported Anthony Taylor's on-field decision of a yellow card saying the contact was \"glancing and not with excessive force\".\n\nProfessional Game Match Officials boss Webb insists too much has been made of the slow-motion replays and a yellow card was an acceptable outcome.\n\n\"The officials on the field saw the actions of Dalot, they saw him stretch forward with his foot, he touches the ball, and then there's contact on Jeremy Doku,\" Webb said on Match Officials Mic'd Up.\n\n\"They deemed that to be a reckless action and therefore worthy of a yellow card.\n\n\"I know other people think it's clearly red. I don't agree - I think there's a mix of considerations.\n\n\"I know that when we look at this, we see that the point of contact is on the knee, but we also have to factor in speed, force and intensity.\n\n\"You'll not see many red cards in the Premier League for serious foul play that don't involve those things.\n\n\"Now, we evaluate those things through a full-speed view of the incident. Without looking at it at full speed, you get kind of a distorted view. You don't get a true picture of how much force and speed there was in the challenge.\n\n\"That foot touches the knee, comes off pretty quickly. We can see on slow-mo that it does touch that knee.\n\n\"But at full speed, when you play it in real time, you can see there's not a great deal of speed in the action. Not a lot of intensity.\n\n\"We were heavily criticised a few years ago for using slow motion and freeze frames, because people said this is not reality, it's not how the game is played.\n\n\"When you slow it down it can look a lot worse - and it does. When you freeze frame it, you can make a lot of situations look like red-card offences.\n\n\"So, it's difficult for me to hear people make a judgment on this just by analysing freeze frames and slow motion, coming to the consideration that it's red on that basis.\"",

    "fullText": "Not too long ago, Manchester United fans were fearing the worst when it came to Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nWith Ruben Amorim not handing him a single start in the Premier League, it looked certain that the Carrington wonderkid would be jumping ship in January.\n\nINEOS had blocked his loan demand in the summer, but the 20-year-old was now contemplating a permanent transfer away from his boyhood club.\n\nAll that has changed in the past 10 days. The Portuguese tactician got himself sacked, and with Michael Carrick now at the helm, the Englishman’s fortunes have shifted as well.\n\nHe earned his first league start of the campaign in the Manchester derby, and he put on a show against Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nThe caretaker head coach has managed to fire up the Carrington graduate, who is in a far better place mentally as compared to a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe midfield wonderkid is excited again, and is looking forward to earning more minutes under the legendary midfielder, who is more inclined towards handing opportunities to academy products.\n\nAnd as revealed by Teamtalk, the England international is not looking to jump ship any longer and as a result, exit talks with potential suitors like Napoli and Chelsea have been paused.\n\n“Kobbie Mainoo’s immediate future looks to be at Manchester United, with sources indicating the young midfielder is content to stay at Old Trafford provided he continues to receive regular playing time under interim manager Michael Carrick.\n\n“One of Carrick’s early priorities was to personally assure Mainoo of his importance to the team’s plans. Sources close to the situation reveal that the former United midfielder made it clear he views the England international as a central figure in his vision for the club.\n\n“Sources say Mainoo is excited by the fresh opportunities now available to him. Having been starved of consistent starts previously, the chance to play regularly under Carrick has changed his outlook.\n\n“Exit discussions that had gained traction earlier in the month have been paused by sources, with Carrick’s assurances proving pivotal in convincing the youngster to stay and fight for his place.”\n\nKobbie Mainoo cannot afford to relax. He must keep up the same level of performance against Arsenal next weekend as the Red Devils look to climb up the table.\n\nFeature image Jan Kruger via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nRobert Sanchez (Chelsea): Coming off the back of a terrible week with his errors against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup, you have to say he answered the questions the right way. Delivered against Brentford, made some big saves, kept Chelsea in the game and kept a clean sheet, which helps along the way.\n\nAlex Jimenez (Bournemouth): He came off in the 90th minute of Monday's 1-1 draw at Brighton, cramped up, but a wonderful performer. Defended excellently, and the way he went forward was fantastic as well. Unfortunately, he couldn't keep a clean sheet right at the end, but he actually wasn't on the pitch for that situation, so he gets a pass for that.\n\nHarry Maguire (Manchester United): Manchester United were excellent as they beat neighbours City on Saturday. I could've put the whole of the United team in this week, to be totally honest. However, having Harry Maguire back from his hamstring injury is huge for Michael Carrick. He was probably United's best player during Ruben Amorim's time in charge as well.\n\nJames Tarkowski (Everton): Wonderful performance in Sunday's win at Aston Villa. He gets in both for his attacking threat and also because defensively, he was a monster. I think he's one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. He's fantastic with the way he approaches the game and what he delivers.\n\nLewis Hall (Newcastle United): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile during Newcastle's 0-0 draw at Wolves on Sunday, and he's starting to make the case that he should be starting for England. That's how good he's been this season.\n\nCrysencio Summerville (West Ham): He gets a goal - but it is more about the magnitude of the moment, and being able to get West Ham off to a flying start against Tottenham. With Saturday's 2-1 win, there is a little bit of hope now that they can get out of this mess that they find themselves in.\n\nEthan Ampadu (Leeds United): Every time Ampadu plays well, Leeds play well. Whenever they win, he is at the heart of everything. He got an assist as they beat Fulham on Saturday but the tackles and covering runs were more important. A top performance.\n\nEnzo Le Fee (Sunderland): He is excellent. He has quality and he oozes class. He gives me the same feeling as when Carlos Tevez went to West Ham - you could see he was too good for that level. He picked up some brilliant positions against Crystal Palace, and also scored a wonderful goal in Sunderland's 2-1 win.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): He would have been a scorer in the Manchester derby if he had managed to stay onside, but he was the heart of the United performance. How many times are we going to say that? United are only as good as he drives them to be.\n\nPatrick Dorgu (Manchester United): He seems a freer player since being moved up the pitch. There have been a lot of conversations about systems at United, but with Dorgu, one thing is clear - as a high left-sided player, he seems to have added a lot to his game. More goals helps as well.\n\nBryan Mbeumo (Manchester United): Playing out of position in Saturday's derby, he ran his socks off, and delivered with a goal - a wonderful finish. He carried the team over the line. Hopefully now he can start to find the net more consistently for Manchester United.\n\nMichael Carrick (Manchester United): A tough week for him. A lot of people, including Roy Keane and myself, were questioning whether he's good enough and things of that nature - or whether he even deserves the role. He answered emphatically. A wonderful, wonderful result. I think you have to say that's easily the manager's performance of the week. Now, can he back it up against Arsenal next week?\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "One player who was conspicuous by his absence when Michael Carrick named his first Manchester United squad was Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nThe Dutchman has started only four Premier League games all season, as former head coach Ruben Amorim was clearly not a fan.\n\nWith his minutes drastically reduced, the Netherlands international was keen to jump ship in January, with AS Roma pushing hard for his signature.\n\nThey had proposed an initial loan with a conditional obligation and had even submitted their contract with the 24-year-old’s representatives.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\nHowever, Amorim’s sack meant an exit was blocked and it was decided that the former Bologna ace would not be allowed to leave in winter.\n\nThe Giallorossi finally admitted defeat, but with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo back, and Benjamin Sesko’s red-hot form, the former Bayern Munich star is unlikely to start too many games.\n\nWhich is why Juventus have identified him as their Plan B in case they fail to persuade Crystal Palace to part with Jean-Philippe Mateta as per Teamtalk.\n\n“Juventus have an eye on Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee in case they fail in their bid to sign Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, sources confirm.\n\n“There is a belief that he will still do well back in Serie A, where he had a good spell with Bologna.\n\n“Roma tried to sign him this month but ran into difficulties after Ruben Amorim departed – so even a deal for the United man would not be easy, even though he is keen on a new challenge.”\n\nDespite Joshua Zirkzee being open to the possibility, it will be a difficult deal to crack unless INEOS bring in another forward.\n\nWith Champions League qualification the goal, the co-owners cannot afford to leave Carrick short in the second-half of the campaign.\n\nThe versatile forward is currently injured, and it will be interesting to see if he makes the matchday squad for the game against Arsenal. Should his chances continue to be limited, he might yet push for an exit later in the window.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The Premier League has once again joined forces with leagues and player unions from around the world to ask football's lawmakers to trial temporary concussion substitutes.\n\nRequests to implement temporary replacements have been repeatedly turned down by the International Football Association Board (Ifab).\n\nThe Premier League's new motion is supported by 28 other competitions and player bodies.\n\nPlayers' union Fifpro, Serie A, France's Professional Football League, Major League Soccer, Premier Soccer League South Africa, the European Leagues and World Leagues Association are among those to have co-signed the proposal.\n\nThe letter says it is in the best interests of player welfare based on available medical and scientific evidence.\n\nIt has been sent to Ifab before its annual business meeting in London on Tuesday.\n\nThe Premier League has issued a separate letter, supported by the EFL and the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), putting itself forward to hold the trial and provide full results.\n\nPermanent concussion substitutes were added to the laws of the game in 2024 after a trial period. Ifab believes this shows zero tolerance to concussion.\n\nA player who is believed to have experienced a concussion must be substituted and cannot go back on to the pitch.\n\nBut the Premier League argues permanent substitutions create a greater chance a team will risk leaving a player on the field.\n\nWith the temporary substitutes a player would be removed from the field for 10-15 minutes for a full medical assessment. If there is no concussion the player would then be able to return.",

The reality is they will actually never have a better chance of ending a Premier League title drought stretching back to 'The Invincibles' of 2004.\n\nMikel Arteta's side have emerged from the weekend with an advantage stretched to seven points as the chasing pack aiming to put them under pressure stumbled badly.\n\nArsenal and Arteta will rightly urge caution, but the Gunners will never forgive themselves if they do not claim the crown that has proved so elusive, faced with the domination of Manchester City and the successes of Liverpool.\n\nWhen every circumstance is examined, this feels like the 'now or never' season for Arteta's Arsenal.\n\nIf they fail to win the title this season from such a position, the regrets will run deep. Everything is in place for a triumphant surge towards the finishing tape.\n\nBack-to-back goalless draws has left some questioning Arsenal's firepower but, with the tightest defence in the league and their rivals continually slipping up, it would take a brave person to back against them now.\n\nBigger leads have been lost at the top of the Premier League before - and later in the season - but none of the teams below them are showing signs of producing the consistency needed to challenge them.\n\nManchester City failed to turn up the pressure valve before Arsenal travelled to the City Ground by losing the derby at Manchester United - a fourth straight match without a win.\n\nAnd then, here at Villa Park, Aston Villa saw their hopes of leap-frogging Pep Guardiola's side into second place undone as excellent Everton secured a fully deserved win.\n\nAs for reigning champions Liverpool, they have mounted a miserable defence of their crown, Saturday's disappointing draw against Burnley at Anfield that provoked jeers from their fans leaving them fourth, a distant 14 points behind Arsenal.\n\nVilla had won their previous 11 games at home, but Everton threatened the decisive moments long before Thierno Barry cashed in on keeper Emi Martinez's decision to turn a routine stop into an item for his showreel with a classy finish.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool fans will no doubt be feeling a little frustrated.\n\nMarc Guehi was in the Premier League champions’ grasp just a few short months ago but now looks set to move to Manchester City.\n\nSporting director Richard Hughes agreed a fee for the Crystal Palace captain back on transfer deadline day. The Reds would pay an initial £35m for Guehi - whose contract at the FA Cup holders was due to expire in summer 2026.\n\nBut owing to a failure to land a replacement Palace pulled the plug with the 25-year-old defender instead staying put.\n\nMan City’s needs for a top-quality centre-back have increased in recent weeks - considering the injuries suffered by Ruben Dias, John Stones and above all Josko Gvardiol.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThat meant Pep Guardiola brought forward a deal for Guehi - who was set to become a high-profile free agent next summer. The England defender will now join City on a bumper contract for a fee of around £20m - leaving Liverpool empty-handed.\n\nPlans will now need to be made for an alternative defender to come to Anfield - and it’s unlikely to happen in January. But next summer the picture will change and the Merseysiders will need to recruit a solid, senior option in the position.\n\nAnd according to a report in TEAMtalk one Liverpool target Alessandro Bastoni is willing to move.\n\nThe Inter Milan defender, 26, is under contract at San Siro until 2028 and it’s speculated that a fee of around £70m would be required to sign the Italy international.\n\n“Alessandro Bastoni is very much open to a transfer this year,” the report reads.\n\nIt looks like Chelsea will also be in the market for Bastoni - a left-footed centre-back who can also play in a back three. Other players reported to be under consideration for a Liverpool role include Nico Schlotterbeck and Nathan Collins.\n\nBastoni has won two Serie A titles for the Nerazzurri since debuting in the 2019/20 season and has also helped his side reach two Champions League final. He was also a member of the Italy squad which won the 2020 UEFA European Championship at Wembley.",

We always talk about the energy we need. It's related to how you defend, some moments, some duels and some situations, but also with the ball.\n\n\"It's my 27th derby.

    "description": "Manchester City were outfought by rivals Manchester United on Saturday lunchtime and the damaging defeat could leave them outmanoeuvred in this season's Premier League title race.",
    "fullText": "Manchester City were outfought by rivals Manchester United on Saturday lunchtime in a derby defeat that not only gave their neighbours a winning start to a new era, but also dealt a further blow to the Citizems' title hopes.\n\nCity's demoralising 2-0 loss at a raucous Old Trafford allowed the home faithful to deservedly claim the bragging rights over their closest geographical rivals as they revelled in the perfect start to Michael Carrick's tenure as interim head coach.\n\nBut for the blue half of the City, defeat leaves them clinging to the title race by their fingertips, potentially falling nine points behind leaders Arsenal by the end of the day.\n\nThis was City's sixth game in 17 days and boss Pep Guardiola felt a lack of energy contributed to the defeat, rather than the decision not to send United's Diogo Dalot off in the first half.\n\n\"The better team won,\" said the Spaniard. \"They had something we didn't have. We always talk about the energy we need. It's related to how you defend, some moments, some duels and some situations, but also with the ball.\n\n\"It's my 27th derby, I came here many times and [today] we were not at the required level to win this type of game.\n\n\"We try, we talk about that but we had that energy four days ago at Newcastle. Even at Sunderland and the three games we draw we played extremely good in many departments but today no.\n\nA 'perfect' start for Carrick - how Man Utd ran rivals ragged\n\nMan Utd claim memorable derby victory over Man City\n\n'No panic buy' - Guehi would cap £414m rebuild as Man City up title ante\n\nUnited scored twice in the second half through Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu, and they also had three goals ruled out for offside, hit the woodwork twice and forced visiting goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma into a string of saves.\n\nThe hosts could have been reduced to 10 men inside the first 10 minutes when full-back Dalot caught Jeremy Doku in a knee-high challenge with his studs.\n\nReferee Anthony Taylor brandished a yellow card for the Portuguese and the decision was supported by the video assistant referee (VAR).\n\nThe Premier League match centre explained the decision by saying: \"The referee's call of yellow card to Dalot for a reckless challenge was checked and confirmed by VAR - with the contact deemed to be glancing and not with excessive force.\"\n\nGuardiola said: \"It's a red card but it would be poor as a manager to analyse that as the reason for [losing] the game - it is what it is.\n\n\"For 85 minutes 10 against 11 I believe, but if we played with the energy that we did, we were nowhere near that. I could say that and blame [the decision], but we will not grow up and move forward.\n\n\"It happened and it is not a surprise, it happened in the past when I arrived here. Honestly, we have to look at ourselves. If the players have excuses, we will be in trouble in the future.\n\n\"We have to look at ourselves and today the analysis is simple - Manchester United were better and we have to accept it.\"\n\nFormer Premier League official Darren Cann told BBC Sport he thought Dalot was \"very fortunate to escape a red card\".\n\n\"It's a hard one to see at normal speed live on the pitch from the referee's angle but with the benefit of replays I do feel that Dalot is very fortunate not receive a red card,\" he added.\n\n\"Had the referee been invited to the screen I am sure he would have been shown a red card.\"\n\nInterim United boss Carrick said: \"I am not giving you that [Guardiola's] answer, I have not seen it but I thought at the time Diogo got the ball and kicked it out. I did not think for one second it was a bad challenge. I got told later it was a lack of force [that meant he was not shown red].\"\n\nFollowing this loss and draws against Sunderland, Chelsea and Brighton, City are now winless in their last four league games and have handed a major advantage to Mikel Arteta's Arsenal.\n\nCity are close to completing the £20m signing of Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi to bolster the defence but the arduous schedule now appears to be catching up with City's front players.\n\nStriker Erling Haaland is in a barren run of form, scoring just once - from the penalty spot - in his last seven games and without a goal from open play since 20 December.\n\nThe Norwegian was out-battled by United defender Lisandro Martinez on Saturday, managing just 14 touches of the ball in the entire game and failing to manage a shot on target.\n\nPhil Foden has gone eight straight games without scoring while substitute Rayan Cherki, who scored late on at Newcastle during the week, was unable to influence the game.\n\nCity's expected goal (xG) rate of 0.45 in the contest was the second lowest recorded in Guardiola's 364 games in charge in the Premier League.\n\nThe 54-year-old, who celebrates his birthday on Sunday, told BBC Match of the Day: \"We were not good enough up front. We could not do it. I had a feeling we didn't have and they had it and they deserve it.\n\n\"Normally in the beginning of the game when they come to Etihad Stadium our rhythm is another one and it's normal doing that.\n\n\"Offensively we did not have the intention in the final third to score a goal, to make a cross, to make a movement. We were more predictable.\"\n\nCity will aim to get their season back on track with a trip to Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\nDespite boasting 68% of the possession, City were limited to one shot on target and the second lowest xG of Guardiola’s Premier League career.\n\nUnited looked to funnel City into wide areas before defending intensely with four players. On the left, for example, Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu, Kobbie Mainoo and Luke Shaw converged to reduce the time and space City had.\n\nThe number of players committed to the side the ball was on meant the space was on the far side, but City struggled to switch the point of attack, something Antoine Semenyo, Jeremy Doku and Rico Lewis do less of than some of their team-mates.\n\nPhil Foden on the right wing or Matheus Nunes have shown this ability in the past and the latter was a particular miss.\n\nCity lacked Nunes’ physical profile to help deal with United’s threat on transition by tracking the runs of Patrick Dorgu and aiding Rodri, who found himself having to deal with both Mbeumo and Bruno at times.\n\nWhen penned back, United defended in a way that gave time and space to the City centre-backs more than anybody else.\n\nBut, despite stopping numerous counter-attacks, when he had possession Abdukodir Khusanov struggled to take advantage of the spaces United left, as did Nathan Ake and Max Alleyne.\n\nTheir lack of ball-playing quality meant City struggled in a way they may not have done if they'd had the injured Josko Gvardiol, John Stones and Ruben Dias on the pitch.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool drew 1-1 against in their Premier League clash on Saturday.\n\nThe Reds were on top for most of the game with Scott Parker's men often unable to match the firepower of the reigning Premier League champions.\n\nArne Slot's men have found themselves on a decent run over the last couple of months with the Anfield outfit now just seven points adrift of second-placed Manchester City.\n\nMost of the Reds' players put in decent performances on Saturday but the display that one Liverpool player put on seemed to stand out for ex-Everton ace Leon Osman.\n\nSince the 2025-26 season kicked off, Hugo Ekitike has arguably been Liverpool's best-performing player.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThe striker has often carried the Reds' attack on his back with the Frenchman often outperforming Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak.\n\nSince both have been absent from Slot's squad over the last month or so, Ekitike has really come into his own and formed an impressive partnership with Florian Wirtz.\n\nAnd, it was a moment produced by both attackers which caught the eye of Osman on Saturday.\n\n\"That was a really good piece of play from Liverpool,\" he said on USA Network.\n\n\"Good ball from Wirtz, good intent again from Ekitike, he's the one isn't he.\n\n\"When he hits the ball, he does want to get in on goal, he does and his net touch could be the one that gets him on the scoresheet.\"\n\nLiverpool's performances between the end of October and the end of November really derailed their season.\n\nIt was clear that none of their new signings were able to blend with one another and perform to the best standards possible.\n\nAnd, while most fans, pundits and journalists expected there to be a bit of onboarding troubles, nobody could have anticipated how many games the Reds would actually end up losing.\n\nHowever, now that Slot's men have seemingly gotten used to playing alongside one another, it feels like things are finally falling into place and, if they can continue this run of form, there's no reason why they can't re-enter the Premier League title race.\n\nOf course, the Champions League is likely to be their main focus, but, for now, they must ensure that they keep consistent and continue building on their recent outings to give them the best chance possible.",

The money will be there for director of football Mateu Alemany to spend, and some of it could be spent on Joao Gomes.\n\nAs per Marca, Atleti are interested in Gomes, who is also wanted by Manchester United and Napoli. The 24-year-old, who has featured 10 times for Brazil, is expected to leave Wolves in 2026, given that relegation from the Premier League is seen as an absolutely certainty to happen.\n\nA sale this month would allow Wolves to bring in a bigger transfer fee for Gomes, especially given the strong interest being shown in his services. This wouldn’t be overly ideal for Atleti, who would prefer not to get into a bidding war for one of their leading targets.\n\nThe impending departure of Raspadori means that Atleti will need a new attacker, but midfield is the absolute priority right now. The plan is for a deal to be done as soon as possible, which is why numerous targets are being looked at – with one of them being Gomes.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who Atleti end up going for. They have many options at their disposal, but finding the right one to compete with Barrios, Koke and Cardoso will be crucial.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot has been under pressure this season. Now his Liverpool future just suffered a massive blow that he must battle against.\n\nArne Slot delivered the Premier League title in his first season as Liverpool boss. Few, then, could have imagined that he'd be facing the sack in his second.\n\nBut that's been the reality. We don't believe he's been on the brink of losing his job, admittedly, but the pressure has skyrocketed after Liverpool's worst run of form for 70 years.\n\nWe've seen some of the absolute worst results of any modern Liverpool team, including a 3-0 home defeat to Nottingham Forest followed by a 4-1 home defeat against PSV Eindhoven.\n\nIt's been awful at times. And the reality is that Liverpool haven't had consistently good form since the start of 2025. While a lot of last season's struggles were ignored because of the title procession, they've been impossible to ignore this season.\n\nThere's always been one obvious reason why Liverpool wouldn't sack Slot, though. However, that reason has now disappeared.\n\nIf Liverpool sacked Slot, who would come in? That's the question that always made moving on from the Dutchman improbable.\n\nAfter all, Slot was Liverpool's pick back in early 2024 and the group of available coaches hasn't exactly moved on dramatically. There haven't been any obvious hires.\n\nContrast that to when Brendan Rodgers was let go in 2015 - both Jurgen Klopp and Carlo Ancelotti were available and willing to talk.\n\nBut things changed on Monday. Real Madrid have sacked Xabi Alonso - even if they're calling it 'mutual termination' - and the former Liverpool midfielder is free to join a new club.",

    "fullText": "No team has ever won the Premier League title without having a player in the top 10 goal scorers, but could Arsenal change that?\n\nThe Gunners are having an excellent season with only two defeats in all competitions, boasting a 100% record in the Champions League, while they are six points clear at the top of the Premier League.\n\nMikel Arteta's side are also in the semi-final of the Carabao Cup and have progressed to the fourth round of the FA Cup. Those stats are even more impressive when taking into account Arsenal are doing it all without a free-scoring forward.\n\nWhile only Manchester City have scored more than Arsenal's 40 league goals this season, Arsenal have not had a regular scorer to rely on.\n\nErling Haaland has already netted 20 league goals this season, while Arsenal's top scorers in the division are Leandro Trossard and Viktor Gyokeres - who sit 21st in the goalscoring rankings with five goals each.\n\nArsenal spent £64m on Gyokeres in the summer but the Swedish international has struggled to replicate the form he showed playing for Sporting in Portugal, where he scored 97 goals in 102 games.\n\nIt has been disappointing for the 27-year-old whose recent performances have looked like he is severely lacking confidence. In Arsenal's last league game against Liverpool, the forward only had eight touches and failed to take a shot, while he has scored just once from open play in the last 15 games.\n\nThe Gunners have not won the league since 2004 but are many people's favourites to lift the title - and if they manage to do it, it will be their first piece of silverware since 2020 when they won the FA Cup in Arteta's first season in charge.",

    "fullText": "Joao Pedro’s window at Chelsea is closing, and the next few games will tell us a lot about his short term future.\n\nHe came in with a big impact at the Club World Cup, and gave everyone the hope that Chelsea’s striker troubles were over. But as time has passed, it’s become clear that he prefers to play as a number ten.\n\nThat’s all well and good. The problem is that Chelsea already have plenty of number tens. There’s an argument they have too many, even without the Brazil star. Meanwhile, they’re pretty short up front.\n\nLiam Delap has missed most of the season injured, and has only just scored his first Premier League goal a week ago. Yet as far as we can see, he’s ahead of JP in the pecking order for Liam Rosenior. Delap may not score, but he puts himself about. That’s more than you can say for Joao Pedro at the moment.\n\nJoao Pedro protests a decision against Arsenal. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWith Enzo Fernandez, Andrey Santos, Cole Palmer and even Estevao Willian pushing for minutes at 10, and Delap a better option up top, JP is looking a little lost right now. Rotation and injuries will always mean he’s in line for fairly regular action, especially off the bench where he provides a good option.\n\nBut right now, it’s hard to imagine him being considered first choice. He’s got 18 Premier League starts and 3 sub appearances, so he’s featured in every game so far this season. We doubt that record is going to continue.\n\nWest Ham are circling around the drain of the Premier League, and are getting desperate for solutions. They’re now sniffing around a player who Chelsea don’t even use.\n\nCole Palmer had his annus mirabilis under Mauricio Pochettino rather than Enzo Maresca and the stats show it clearly – but how much of that was actually down to the coaches?",

One of the most prominent names discussed earlier in the window was Joel Ordonez.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThe Ecuador international was reported by outlets in his homeland to have agreed personal terms ahead of a potential move from Club Brugge to Anfield.\n\nThe 21-year-old would cost in the region of £35m - and earn around £57k per week on his first Liverpool contract.\n\nOrdonez has grown into a consistent Belgian league and Champions League performer since initially joining Club Brugge’s feeder club back in 2022 from Independiente del Valle.\n\nHis form for club and country put him on the map for bigger teams - Liverpool included - although the trail seems to have gone cold over the last week or so.\n\nHowever a report in Football Insider claims that a deal for Ordonez is still very much ON - although it may have to wait until summer 2026.\n\n“Liverpool may try to sign Club Brugge defender Joel Ordonez in a future transfer window and could “look elsewhere” to sign a new centre-back this month,” the report reads.\n\nOther centre-back names linked for the January window include Guehi as well as Micky van de Ven and Jeremy Jacquet.\n\nA centre-back overhaul could take place on Merseyside next summer - with Ibrahima Konate destined to leave once his contract expire and Joe Gomez also a potential departure.\n\nLiverpool have taken action to restock their academy with new central defenders in recent weeks - and a senior shakeup may now soon follow.",

    "fullText": "Two days on from Macclesfield's stunning FA Cup third-round win over Crystal Palace, the heroics are still sinking in for manager John Rooney.\n\nThe Silkmen - who play in the sixth tier of English football - produced the greatest shock in the competition's history with a 2-1 victory over their Premier League opponents and the current holders.\n\n\"Did I ever think we would get the win and through to the next round? No, I probably didn't,\" Rooney told BBC Breakfast.\n\n\"There was always that bit of hope and, as it's the FA Cup, it throws up mad moments.

    "fullText": "Liverpool’s recruitment work remains firmly ongoing, despite last summer delivering a Premier League title and a significant refresh of the squad. Credit must go to TEAMtalk for the original report, which sheds light on a familiar name continuing to feature prominently in the club’s forward planning.\n\nUnder Arne Slot, Liverpool have taken a measured and data led approach to squad building, but there is a clear sense that further evolution is required. While the collapse of a late move for Marc Guehi left some frustration, attention has now turned towards attacking depth, particularly on the left side of the frontline.\n\nInjuries have played their part in shaping January discussions, with Alexander Isak’s leg break limiting options across the front line. However, the lack of a natural replacement following Luis Diaz’s departure last summer has been evident for some time.\n\nCody Gakpo has shouldered much of the responsibility, with Rio Ngumoha also used in flashes, but Liverpool’s recruitment team are clearly exploring alternatives with greater consistency and upside. The left wing is viewed as an area where elite competition could raise the overall attacking level.\n\nAccording to TEAMtalk, Liverpool remain in regular contact with Paris Saint-Germain forward Bradley Barcola, a player who has been tracked for a considerable period. His situation in Paris remains uncertain, with negotiations over a new contract ongoing but no guarantees over his long term role.\n\nThe report states that PSG have ruled out a January exit, though the summer window could tell a different story. Valued at €69.6m (£60m) and under contract until 2028, Barcola is attracting interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City, underlining his standing across Europe.\n\nBarcola’s recent involvement at PSG has been limited, having “started on the bench for five of PSG’s last six league games, being an unused substitute twice.” That context matters. Liverpool will be monitoring whether this pattern continues under Luis Enrique.\n\nSlot can offer something compelling, a defined role, tactical clarity and the promise of regular minutes in a title challenging side. Richard Hughes and his recruitment staff are unlikely to force matters in January, but groundwork is clearly being laid should circumstances shift.\n\nFrom a Liverpool supporter’s perspective, this report feels quietly encouraging rather than headline grabbing. The key detail is not an imminent bid, but the fact that regular contact is being maintained. That suggests intent and patience, two traits that have defined Liverpool’s smartest recruitment cycles in recent years.\n\nBradley Barcola fits the profile many fans hoped for after Luis Diaz left. Young, technically strong, comfortable on the left and capable of stretching defences. Watching Gakpo adapt admirably has been positive, but there is room for another elite option who naturally thrives in wide areas.\n\nArne Slot’s system relies heavily on wide attackers who can receive between the lines and carry threat in isolation. Barcola looks well suited to that role, especially if offered trust and continuity. The idea that Liverpool could present him with a guaranteed place in the XI feels realistic rather than speculative.\n\nSupporters also appreciate the calm approach. There is no sense of panic buying, even with injuries disrupting plans. Instead, Liverpool appear content to wait for the right moment, trusting that situations like Barcola’s can evolve quickly.\n\nIf this one reaches the summer, optimism will grow. Liverpool staying close, informed and ready to move is often how the most successful deals begin.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool’s pursuit of attacking reinforcements has taken another turn following confirmation that Antoine Semenyo will be heading to Manchester City. As Anfield Watch outline, this was a deal Liverpool clearly admired but ultimately could not land, prompting a familiar recalibration rather than panic. Under Arne Slot, recruitment remains measured, analytical and rooted in long term fit rather than short term noise.\n\nAs Anfield Watch note, “How keen and how serious the club’s interest was in comparison to Man City remains moot. We may never know how close Liverpool got to completing this deal, or just how far away they were from it.” That uncertainty defines much of modern Transfers, where even strong interest does not always translate into decisive movement.\n\nLiverpool’s admiration for Semenyo was well established. “They clearly like Semenyo, and have been wanting to add a similar profile to him for a while.” With that profile still a priority, attention has turned to a player long tracked by Liverpool scouts.\n\nAccording to Anfield Watch, “The club has added Kevin Schade to their shortlist for the summer window. The German international has been followed by Liverpool scouts for over five years now and back when he started to emerge as an exciting youngster at Freiburg, the Reds did already consider making a move for him.” That line speaks volumes about Liverpool’s recruitment philosophy, patient, informed and rarely impulsive.\n\nJurgen Klopp’s admiration for Schade’s style is also noted in the report, although the eventual move never materialised due to valuation concerns. Schade instead joined Brentford, where he has steadily developed into a key Premier League performer. Now 24, he is approaching his peak years with tangible output to match his raw attributes.\n\nSchade’s appeal lies not only in goals and assists but in traits that Liverpool currently lack in abundance. As Anfield Watch explain, “Predominantly a left-winger, Schade is very much of the Semenyo mould.” He is an inverted forward, capable centrally and across the line, offering tactical elasticity that Slot values highly.\n\nHis pace is striking. “During his first season in the league, Schade clocked in a top-speed of 36.37 km/h which was faster than the likes of Alphonso Davies and Erling Haaland in the Bundesliga.” That speed has translated to England, where “he has clocked in a top-speed of 34.8km/h for Brentford, which is the fastest for the club in the Premier League this season.”\n\nCrucially, Schade runs beyond defences rather than always demanding the ball to feet. “Right now, Liverpool don’t really have this kind of profile.” With Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah preferring play in front of defensive lines, Schade would stretch opponents vertically and horizontally.\n\nAnfield Watch conclude that Schade offers “a new element and new dimension to Liverpool’s attack.” That assessment feels accurate. His pressing, channel running and positional flexibility align neatly with Slot’s emphasis on speed and intensity. Added to that, “for most of his career in the Bundesliga, he played as a right-winger so he can play across the front three.”\n\nLiverpool rarely move without conviction. Schade’s presence on the shortlist suggests quiet groundwork already laid, positioning Liverpool well should summer opportunities arise.\n\nMissing out on Semenyo hurts in the short term, but the idea that Liverpool already have alternatives like Kevin Schade under serious consideration speaks to continuity in recruitment.\n\nSchade feels like a Slot player. Pace, pressing and positional intelligence are non negotiable under this regime, and the Brentford winger ticks those boxes. Fans have often called for more runners in behind, particularly against low blocks, and Schade’s speed profile directly addresses that gap.\n\nThere is also comfort in the timeline. Liverpool tracking him for over five years shows this is not opportunism but strategy. Supporters have seen how well that approach has worked with past Bundesliga imports. The concern, as ever, will be cost. Brentford sell hard and sell well.\n\nYet if Liverpool are serious about evolving the attack post title win, adding variety matters as much as adding goals. Schade might not arrive with fanfare, but he feels like the kind of signing that quietly raises the ceiling of the squad.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League has a habit of calling its own back. For Conor Gallagher, that call may arrive just 18 months after he left Chelsea for Atletico Madrid. According to reporting credited to talkSPORT, Aston Villa are exploring a deal to bring the midfielder back to England, potentially on loan with an obligation to buy. It feels like one of those stories shaped as much by timing as by tactics.\n\nGallagher is 25, soon to be 26, experienced but still with something to prove. Villa, meanwhile, are a club pushing against their own ceiling, chasing Champions League football and silverware under Unai Emery. That alignment matters.\n\nEmery’s long standing interest in Gallagher is key. He “has been keen to sign Gallagher since he was at Chelsea”, a line that hints at continuity of thought rather than opportunism. Villa’s season has not been without bumps, including a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal, yet they remain six points off the leaders and firmly in multiple competitions.\n\nThe FA Cup looms as a genuine opportunity. Villa reached the semi finals last year, losing to Crystal Palace, and Emery knows how thin the margins are. Gallagher’s versatility, energy and Premier League grounding could help Villa sustain challenges on several fronts, including the Europa League, where they are among the favourites.\n\nGallagher’s time in Spain has hardly been a misstep. Since joining Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2024, he has played 51 La Liga games and made 27 appearances in all competitions this season alone. Life under Diego Simeone has clearly resonated.\n\nHe told the FA’s website, “It was amazing, a really good experience. It was a really warm welcome, and it made me feel at home straight away.” On Simeone, he added, “He wants everyone to work as hard as possible… He is one of the best managers in the world.”\n\nYet international football complicates the picture. Gallagher “would welcome a return to England to help his hopes of forcing his way into Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup squad”. Since Tuchel’s arrival, his England involvement has been limited to a 3-1 defeat to Senegal, while Elliot Anderson has surged into contention. Proximity matters, and Premier League visibility still counts.\n\nManchester United’s reported interest feels theoretical for now, given their managerial uncertainty following Ruben Amorim’s exit. Villa, by contrast, offer clarity. Gallagher is not surplus at Atletico, Simeone values him, but football careers often hinge on moments like this.\n\nA return would not diminish his Spanish education. Instead, it could sharpen his relevance at exactly the right time.\n\nFrom an Aston Villa supporter’s perspective, this link makes a lot of sense, even if it comes with understandable nerves. Gallagher feels like an Emery player in spirit. High intensity, tactically disciplined, comfortable pressing and recovering, but also capable of arriving late into the box. Villa have built their rise on structure and energy, and Gallagher fits that profile neatly.\n\nThere is also a sense of maturity about this potential move. This is not a reclamation project or a gamble on potential. Gallagher has 136 Premier League appearances behind him, plus European and La Liga experience. For a squad juggling league ambition, Europa League nights and domestic cups, depth with reliability matters.\n\nSupporters might worry about disrupting midfield balance, especially if the deal carries an obligation to buy. But Emery has shown he can integrate profiles intelligently, rotating without diluting standards. Gallagher’s hunger to re enter the England picture could even work in Villa’s favour, driving performance levels higher.\n\nUltimately, Villa fans want players who see the club as a destination, not a stepping stone. Gallagher’s decision, if it comes, will say a lot about how far Villa believe they have travelled, and how far they still intend to go.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have a break from Premier League action tomorrow when they take on Charlton in the FA Cup third round.\n\nThe Addicks’ manager Nathan Jones has fired up his men ahead of the game, claiming their intent is to give Chelsea a tough game, not look for autographs from their Premier League opposition.\n\n“You start at the third round and you’ve got that opportunity of getting a big one, which is always nice because it’s a test, it’s not because we want to high-five Liam Delap or anyone,” the ex-Southampton coach said.\n\n“What we have to make sure is that it doesn’t become just an autograph session. It becomes a proper game where we can test ourselves, test our structure, test what we do.”\n\nCole Palmer and a fairly generic group of Chelsea players look disappointed. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\n\nWe can certainly expect Charlton to come out all guns blazing. They may be a couple of divisions below, but this is their biggest game of the season so far in terms of audience, and they will want to show what they can do.\n\nMeanwhile Chelsea are in bad form, are playing an intense run of games, will use a mainly rotated team and have a new coach in place. This could be a very tricky tie.\n\nChelsea’s rotten project under BlueCo has been slammed by a player who was at the club in a very different era, and who can’t believe that “money, money, money” is all that remains.\n\nWe won’t get a full preview of Chelsea’s tactics today because it’s going to be a heavily rotated team and he’s only had one day of training. But long term there are questions about how he will solve the big problem from Enzo Maresca’s reign.",

    "description": "Wrexham's remarkable rise continues by knocking Premier League side Nottingham Forest out of the FA Cup in dramatic fashion.",
    "fullText": "\"The stories have been written in the stars, it seems. Literally.\"\n\nWhile scathing of the effort of many of his own players, even Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche acknowledged something is stirring at Wrexham as they knocked his Premier League side out of the FA Cup.\n\nIn front of co-owner Ryan Reynolds, the Red Dragons' Class of 2025-26 etched themselves into cup folklore by taking their top-flight scalp at the Stok Cae Ras on penalties.\n\nWith drama befitting their modern-day Hollywood associationwice they were two goals clear against last year's semi-finalists before being dragged, exhausted, into extra time where they produced a dramatic climax.\n\nFor a club with FA Cup upsets stitched into its fabric, this win was up there with the most climactic - and the hero of the iconic win over Arsenal in 1992, Mickey Thomas, watched on.\n\nBefore the match, manager Phil Parkinson admitted he had wished to take on a Premier League team ever since the club's journey up from the fifth tier began five years ago.\n\n\"We highlighted to the lads some of the great moments in this club's history in the FA Cup and could we make our own bit of history tonight. We've certainly done that,\" Parkinson said.\n\nThey did, and then some - beating top-flight opposition for the first time since 1999 to progress into round four.\n\nBut Wrexham are getting used to writing their own scripts.\n\n\"It's not just about the money, the fame and the people involved who have been amazing in the whole story, but to keep that edge and keep pushing as they're doing is tremendous,\" Forest boss Dyche said.\n\nAnd with a nod to Wrexham's position just outside the Championship play-offs, having been a non-league side as recently as 2023, he added: \"They might well add to the story.\"\n\n'Unacceptable to the badge' - Dyche fumes at FA Cup exit\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\n'I still think of him' - the Wrexham friendship FA Cup hero will never forget\n\nFrom \"colossus\" Arthur Okonkwo's spot-kick heroics to Ollie Rathbone's continued rip-roaring return from injury, and first club goals for both Liberato Cacace and Dom Hyam thrown into the mix, Parkinson said there were \"stories everywhere\" on a truly wild night in north Wales.\n\n\"It's a magical night. It's just a classic FA Cup game,\" said goalscorer Cacace, who was making his first start for Wrexham in more than two months.\n\nIt ensured co-owner Reynolds - accompanied by his mother who witnessed the glory of the world's oldest national football competition in full view - was not left disappointed.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll (Reynolds) be delighted to feel the emotion again inside the Stok Cae Ras,\" said Parkinson.\n\nWrexham sit just one point adrift of the Championship's top six, having won four successive matches in the second tier for the first time in their history.\n\nThe likes of Lewis Brunt, Andy Cannon, Danny Ward, Kieffer Moore and Issa Kabore are all edging ever closer to returning from injury to bolster Parkinson's ranks.\n\nThe possibility of adding to the squad in the January transfer window has not been ruled out, either.\n\nAs for Forest, it's back to the drawing board.\n\nWhile Wrexham made the most of their FA Cup opportunity, Dyche lambasted some of his players for \"not making the most of the platform\".\n\n\"We built up to the game, there was a serious edge to it, we told them about Wrexham - and we were miles off,\" Dyche said.\n\n\"Then we had three important players who came on and showed their hand and the whole thing changed and we looked like a Premier League outfit.\n\n\"The only positive - if there is one out of that first half - is it shows why I'm picking the team I am.\"\n\nForest's focus now will be Premier League survival while Wrexham's will be to join them there next season.\n\nAfter another special night at the Stok Cae Ras - the old romance with the FA Cup no distraction - Wrexham fans will wonder if the stars are aligning for their team this season.\n\nNottingham Forest: Shut Up and Show More Football",

    "fullText": "Manchester City turn to the FA Cup this weekend hoping the competition can provide a release from a frustrating run that has slowed their Premier League momentum.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side host League One opposition Exeter City knowing that domestic cup success may take on added importance given recent league results.\n\nCity arrive in the third round without a win in three matches, having been held to consecutive draws that have stalled their pursuit of high-flying Arsenal at the top of the table.\n\nThose dropped points have not damaged their position irreparably, but they have narrowed the margin for error in a title race that is beginning to stretch.\n\nThe FA Cup therefore offers both an opportunity and a warning, with progress expected but complacency punished ruthlessly in this competition.\n\nCity have been here before, using early-round ties to restore rhythm and confidence when league form has wavered.\n\nGuardiola will expect a sharp response after a sequence of performances that have promised control without delivering the decisive edge.\n\nInjuries and missed chances have played their part, but the feeling persists that City need a result to reset their season.\n\nThis fixture provides the clearest possible platform to do so, even if the opposition arrive with nothing to lose.\n\nExeter City travel to the Etihad as clear underdogs, backed by a sold-out away end and the familiar belief that the FA Cup can rewrite logic.\n\nThe League One side have lifted themselves away from immediate danger in recent weeks and arrive in improved spirits.\n\nTheir journey to this stage has been built on discipline and efficiency, qualities that will be tested relentlessly against elite opposition.\n\nExeter will know that surviving the opening phase would already represent progress, both on the pitch and in belief.\n\nGuardiola’s teams have traditionally treated the FA Cup seriously, reaching the latter stages with remarkable consistency.\n\nHowever, recent finals have ended in disappointment, sharpening the desire to go deeper this time around.\n\nWith other competitions demanding attention later in the month, City will want a professional performance that avoids drama.\n\nRotation is likely, but the expectation of control will remain non-negotiable.\n\nThe gap in resources and quality is vast, yet history offers enough reminders to prevent any sense of entitlement.\n\nEarly goals would settle nerves and allow City to impose structure and tempo.\n\nFailure to do so would invite anxiety and give Exeter a foothold they will gladly exploit.\n\nFor the visitors, the occasion alone is a reward, but the ambition will extend beyond participation.\n\nFor City, this is about restoring authority.\n\nIf they are to keep their season on track, it starts with treating this tie as more than a formality.",

    "fullText": "The FA Cup is still the greatest cup competition in the world and the third round is still a special weekend in the football calendar but, speaking from a manager's perspective, it has become more complicated over the years than it used to be.\n\nThe Premier League now overrides the fixture schedule, and I'm afraid the importance of the FA Cup has diminished somewhat because of that, especially when your club's top-flight status and entire financial footing is at stake.\n\nLike most things in life today, money talks and the Premier League without doubt now does most of the talking.\n\nWith three European league competitions as well, and the number of games and teams involved there, the FA Cup has fallen even further down the pecking order.\n\nWith the number of games now being played, something has to give and it is usually the FA Cup. As a manager, I understood why - even though I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when it was considered very special by everyone - and this year will be no different.\n\nAfter a busy festive period and another round of games in midweek this week, the games this weekend will be looked on by the Premier League teams as a chance to rest some of their players, and in some cases all of them!\n\nIt's sad to see, even if it could lead to opportunities for smaller clubs to join the band of giantkillers which the competition has become famous for down the years.\n\nI have experienced both sides of the coin. When we were promoted to the Premier League in 2008, Stoke initially struggled and at the turn of the year, when we came to a third-round tie at League One side Hartlepool, I changed practically the whole team.",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): He kept a clean sheet against Sunderland, and he's really starting to command as a regular number one. He's starting to show that he commands the area in the right way. Obviously a penalty save always helps.\n\nMichael Keane (Everton): The guy they tried to get rid of, they guy they wanted to replace, the guy they want to move on from, the guy who keeps telling them no. He keeps scoring, he keeps delivering. I think he's gotten really comfortable within his own skin as a human.\n\nIbrahima Konate (Liverpool): I thought this was a vintage Konate performance. Not only did he deliver physically, which we know he can do, but he was in a position to look after his team-mates. When Gabriel Martinelli tried to crudely push Conor Bradley off the pitch at the end, I'm glad Konate stuck up for his team. He got back physically, wasn't a liability and stood up strong.\n\nMax Alleyne (Manchester City): The young man played really, really well against a tough Brighton team. He never got caught wanting and had an opportunity to score. He conducted himself well, and I thought it was a glowing endorsement from Pep Guardiola to start him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): The best player on the pitch. People will say: \"Oh what about him and him?\" But I don't care. If you play football and watch football, you know that Szoboszlai was everywhere. Did the dirty stuff, the horrible stuff, but was one of the best attacking options for Liverpool apart from Jeremie Frimpong. He dictated the play, it was a very good performance.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): He's just a beast. The work that he has done, and the work Eddie Howe has done on him, is just frightening. He keeps popping up with important goals, but remember that they signed him as a striker. He's just turned into a beast of a midfielder who runs all over you.\n\nBrenden Aaronson (Leeds): A couple of goals - though he was at fault for the handball, which was only down to him not being brave enough to take one in the face. Scored two and has won over the Leeds faithful. He's having a really good season and has borne the brunt of some unfair criticism from Leeds fans.\n\nFerdi Kadioglu (Brighton): He was a thorn in Nathan Ake's side all day. On another day, he'd be a bit lucky and score a goal or two, but he was excellent. Brighton weren't scared of Manchester City at all.\n\nHarvey Barnes (Newcastle): Two goals, the second being the match-winner, which was absolute limbs and scenes. He's another player where you're like: \"Go on, show us who you are.\" Unfortunately he always leaves you a little bit wanting. I'm always thinking there's more to come from him. That's not to take anything away from his goals.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Sixteen goals this season. We spoke about him last week - he's flying. Scoring again, carrying Brentford. They've got a real chance as long as he stays fit and continues doing what he's doing.\n\nBenjamin Sesko (Manchester United): He has had a torrid start to his Manchester United career. But he scored two goals at Burnley and you have to give it to him.\n\nKeith Andrews (Brentford): It was a massive result for Brentford to beat Sunderland 3-0. At the start of the season, a lot of people were questioning whether Keith was the right man for the job and whether Brentford could stay in the league.\n\nHis inexperience, the squad getting depleted... now they find themselves on the path towards European places. It's frightening. Sunderland have been really good and I expected them to deal with the physicality of Brentford, but Brentford beat them up.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "Arsenal welcome Liverpool to the Emirates Stadium in a Premier League meeting that carries weight beyond a single evening. This is a fixture shaped by momentum, expectation and the quiet pressure that comes with sustaining belief across a long season. For Arsenal, the aim is continuity. For Liverpool, the task is relevance.\n\nBoth clubs arrive with unbeaten runs worth protecting. Arsenal have responded to early December disappointment with authority, five straight league wins restoring rhythm and confidence. Liverpool, unbeaten in nine across all competitions, have steadied themselves after a turbulent autumn, even if the league table offers an unforgiving reflection of their campaign.\n\nSince the late setback against Aston Villa, Arsenal have rediscovered control. Performances have been sharp rather than spectacular, efficient rather than expansive. That consistency has lifted them back into contention and reinforced the sense that Mikel Arteta’s project continues to edge closer to tangible reward.\n\nProgress to the Carabao Cup semi-final has added to that optimism. Supporters sense an opportunity not simply to win matches but to shape a season. Hosting Liverpool at this point of the campaign feels significant. Victory would represent a sixth consecutive league win and another statement that Arsenal are prepared to shoulder expectation rather than shy away from it.\n\nThe Emirates Stadium has increasingly become a place of assurance. Arsenal’s ability to dictate tempo at home has been central to their recent run, and tonight’s contest offers a chance to underline that authority against familiar opposition.\n\nLiverpool’s story has been more complex. Their nine-game unbeaten sequence speaks of resilience, yet dropped points have left them 14 points adrift of the league leaders. Draws against Fulham, Leeds twice and Sunderland have dulled momentum, even as wins in the capital during this run hint at lingering threat.\n\nArne Slot’s side have not enjoyed a smooth defence of their Premier League title. Injuries, adaptation and inconsistency have shaped a season that has demanded patience. A win over Arsenal would not rewrite the campaign, but it could sharpen its conclusion, offering belief that Liverpool still have influence to exert.\n\nIn the UK, Arsenal vs Liverpool will be shown live on Sky Sports. Coverage begins at 7pm GMT on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League, with kick off scheduled for 8pm.\n\nNeed a VPN to watch the match? Our preferred VPN to watch UK TV from anywhere is LibertyShield.com – they offer a 48 hour no-obligation free trial and have apps or all popular devices including Mac, Windows, FireTV, iPhone/iPad and Android.\n\nThis meeting may not settle the Premier League race, but it will shape how the second half of the season feels for both clubs. For Arsenal, affirmation. For Liverpool, opportunity.",

    "fullText": "Mateus Mane has been on the radar as a bright, young prospect at Wolves for some time and his impact at first-team level has been immediate.\n\nFollowing some promising cameos from the bench, the former Rochdale academy player has started all of Wolves' past four Premier League games. They have yielded five points for his team and two goals expertly taken by the 18-year-old.\n\nAdmittedly much quieter than he had been in the 3-0 win against West Ham - boss Rob Edwards said afterwards that he \"wasn't 100% in terms of his energy\" - Portugal-born Mane provided one of the few moments of real attacking quality that Wolves produced against Everton.\n\nThe England Under-18 international showed wonderful poise to net Wolves' equaliser past England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. After a terrific first touch to control Jorgen Strand Larsen's pass that put him through on goal, there appeared little doubt that he would find the bottom corner with his second.\n\nHe is now Wolves' joint-leading goalscorer in league fixtures this season.\n\nOne of Mane's most noticeable attributes is his willingness to run at defences with the ball and with pace - something which had been sadly lacking for much of the first half of the campaign.\n\nHe leads his team for most dribbles attempted per 90 minutes (4.83) of players who have made more than one league appearance this term.\n\nAlso, Mane is the only Wolves player averaging more than one shot on target per 90 minutes of Premier League action this season (1.41).\n\nThe sample size may be small at this stage, but Mane's introduction to Wolves' starting XI has certainly made a positive difference.",

    "fullText": "The post-Ruben Amorim era showed flashes of promise, but eventually, Manchester United had to be satisfied with only a point from their Premier League encounter against Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nUnder the lights at Turf Moor, it was the home side who took the lead through a lucky deflection, against the run of play.\n\nThe visitors should have scored twice before half-time, but Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha were denied by goalline clearances.\n\nBut then, in the second half, it was the Benjamin Sesko show, as the Slovenian scored twice in 10 minutes to hand the Red Devils the lead.\n\nThe Clarets ended up equalising, but fans were pleased to finally see the Slovenia international return to scoring ways after a difficult last few weeks.\n\nDuring the post-match interaction with BBC, the ex-RB Leipzig striker stated as much, while revealing his delight to end his drought in front of goal.\n\n“It helps me for my confidence,” the striker said. “It’s been tough, but now I finally did it and I’m happy I could help the team.\n\n“This is the most important for me and now it’s just up to me and up to us to keep going like that.”\n\nThere were improvements, both individually, as seen from Sesko and Dorgu’s performance, and as a team, especially from an attacking perspective.\n\nIt was helped by interim boss Darren Fletcher’s brave substitutions. And the United striker told Sky Sports that it is now up to the team to continue this positive momentum moving forward.\n\n“Now it’s up to us. Obviously, to stand together as a group, to really show we can work together no matter what situation.\n\n“In the end, it’s just important for us to focus on the upcoming games, upcoming trainings. That’s the most important.”\n\nUnited will seen next in action in the FA Cup, with a home tie against Brighton on Sunday. Fletcher is expected to remain in charge for the game.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

Bukayo Saka is likely to start, having come off the bench against the Cherries.\n\nDoubts surround Hugo Ekiteke’s involvement on Thursday as the French striker battles a hamstring issue.

    "fullText": "Who is Man United manager vs. Burnley? Caretaker boss, coaching staff for Turf Moor after Ruben Amorim exit originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter 14 months in charge, Ruben Amorim was dismissed by Manchester United on January 5.\n\nWhile the club recovers from a rocky spell under Amorim's leadership, the Red Devils must press on with the Premier League season, beginning with Burnley away.\n\nThe midweek league game at Turf Moor is followed by an FA Cup third-round matchup with fellow top flight side Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford on the weekend. These two matches will see a makeshift coaching group take charge of the team.\n\nThe Sporting News explains how United will press on in the short term as the 20-time English champions rebuild their managerial structure.\n\nMORE:Why was Ruben Amorim sacked? | Amorim's explosive Leeds rant | Cost of Amorim's exit\n\nFormer Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher will take charge for the match against Burnley on Wednesday, January 7.\n\nThe 41-year-old is likely to remain in charge as caretaker manager until an interim boss is assigned for the remainder of the season.\n\nIt's expected that United will not make a permanent hire until the 2025/26 season is completed, unless something unforeseen progresses before that time.\n\nFletcher's former teammate Jonny Evans has been earmarked to return to the coaching staff to assist this week.\n\nBorn in Scotland, Fletcher made 342 appearances for Manchester United during his decorated playing days, winning five Premier League titles and one Champions League crown in a 20-year career under Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nAfter subsequent stints at West Brom and Stoke City, plus career 80 international caps for Scotland, Fletcher retired in 2019 and transitioned to coaching.\n\nHe returned to United's youth setup in October 2020, hired as the Under-16 coach. He was promoted to the first-team coaching staff in January 2021, concurrently serving as technical director until he was replaced in that role by Jason Wilcox in April 2024.\n\nFletcher made the move back to the youth setup as U-18 coach in July 2025, where he has been until being named caretaker in the wake of Amorim's departure.\n\nWhile Fletcher is a candidate to be named permanent manager of United, a lot would have to happen for that to come to pass.\n\nHe would first have to impress as caretaker enough to earn the interim job for the rest of the season to consider him a true permanent option. Should he do that, then consideration about a long-term position could be brought forth.\n\nEven then, hiring an individual with no senior managerial experience would be an enormous risk, one that United likely would be averse to after the disaster of Amorim's tenure.",

It goes back to when he played for me, when his contribution on and off the pitch was incredible.\n\nHaving received an unbelievable reference from Sir Alex about Fletch - which was so good it was frightening - I took him to West Brom in February 2015.",

    "fullText": "Two of the Premier League’s surprise European contenders go head-to-head on Wednesday night as seventh-placed Brentford host Sunderland at the Gtech Community Stadium.\n\nThe Bees have defied early-season scepticism under Keith Andrews, mounting a serious challenge for European places following a dominant 4-2 win over Everton. Currently sitting in seventh place with 30 points, they are within touching distance of the top five. They face a Sunderland side that has displayed remarkable resilience under Régis Le Bris.\n\nThe Black Cats occupy eighth place, level on 30 points with their hosts, after securing an “absorbing” 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. While Sunderland have held elite opposition like Manchester City and Spurs recently, they travel to West London searching for a clinical edge to turn these impressive stalemates into three points.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Sunderland 2–1 Brentford, 30 August 2025, Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews reports no fresh injury concerns following the high-scoring victory at Everton. However, the squad remains depleted by long-term ACL injuries to Fábio Carvalho and Antoni Milambo, while Josh Dasilva is still sidelined. The Bees are also missing Frank Onyeka and Dango Ouattara, who are currently representing their nations at AFCON. Midfielder Mathias Jensen is expected to return to the starting XI after a recent bout of illness.\n\nThe Black Cats face a significant personnel crisis due to AFCON commitments, with six first-team players unavailable: Reinildo Mandava, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Arthur Masuaku, Bertrand Traoré, and Habib Diarra. Manager Régis Le Bris must also sweat on the fitness of forward Wilson Isidor, who will undergo a late test. Centre-back Daniel Ballard remains a doubt with a recurring ankle issue, while Aji Alese is a long-term absentee.\n\nBrentford have transformed the Gtech Community Stadium into a fortress under Keith Andrews. They have won six of their 10 home league games this season, a record matched only by Mark Warburton in the club’s modern history. Notably, striker Igor Thiago is in electric form, having netted 14 goals in 20 appearances. He is now just one goal shy of the Premier League record for most goals by a Brazilian in a single campaign.\n\nSunderland arrive as the division’s undisputed “stalemate specialists,” having drawn each of their last four matches against top-tier opposition. Should they draw again on Wednesday, they would be the first team to record five consecutive Premier League stalemates since 2021. Despite their injury woes, their defensive organisation remains elite; the Black Cats have conceded goals in both halves in only 5% of their matches this season.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Ajer, Collins, Henry; Yarmoliuk, Janelt; Jensen, Damsgaard, Schade; Thiago\n\nSunderland predicted XI: Roefs; Hume, Mukiele, Alderete, Cirkin; Geertruida, Xhaka; Mayenda, Le Fée, Adingra; Brobbey\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Tennis, with coverage starting at 18:00 GMT.\n\nRead more- Semenyo medical booked as Man City eye next transfer target\n\nSee Also- Enzo Maresca breaks silence on Chelsea exit with farewell message\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Fresh from a dramatic weekend in the Premier League title race, Aston Villa travel to Selhurst Park on Wednesday night knowing that a victory could propel them into second place.\n\nUnai Emery’s side recently dispatched Nottingham Forest 3-1 to keep pace with the leaders, but they face a historical “bogey” ground in South London. Crystal Palace find themselves in a mid-winter slump, having failed to win in their last seven matches, but the Eagles have traditionally dominated Villa at home, winning nine of their 13 Premier League encounters at Selhurst Park.\n\nWith Villa level on points with Manchester City following the Citizens’ recent 1-1 draw with Chelsea, the stakes for this road trip have never been higher for the high-flying Villans. Despite their lofty league position, Villa have conceded 14 goals in their last four games against Palace—as many as they had in the previous 15 meetings combined. Emery will be desperate to break his personal jinx against Oliver Glasner, having never beaten the Austrian in six previous meetings.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: Aston Villa 0–3 Crystal Palace, 31 August 2025, Premier League\n\nOliver Glasner’s squad depth is being tested to the limit following a bruising encounter at Newcastle. Nathaniel Clyne (abductor) and Jefferson Lerma (concussion) are both ruled out, joining long-term absentees Daichi Kamada, Daniel Muñoz, and Cheick Doucouré on the sidelines. In a significant boost, Chris Richards is set to return to the matchday squad, though he is likely to start on the bench. The Eagles may hand a full debut to club-record signing Brennan Johnson, who joined from Tottenham last week.\n\nThe visitors are sweating on the fitness of defensive mainstays Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres, with both players facing late tests after lengthy injury layoffs. Midfielders Amadou Onana and Ross Barkley remain unavailable, while Evann Guessand is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast. In their absence, the partnership of Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara is expected to continue in the engine room.\n\nPalace boast incredible home dominance in this fixture, winning six of their last seven home games against Villa. This includes the last three in a row by a combined score of 10-1. Jean-Philippe Mateta remains the man to watch; he has been involved in nine goals against Villa—more than against any other Premier League side. However, the Eagles enter this clash without a win in their last seven outings across all competitions.\n\nVilla have been in sensational form, particularly Ollie Watkins, who has scored six goals since the start of December—more than any other player in the division. A win tonight would take Villa to 45+ points after 21 games for only the third time in their history. Notably, on both previous occasions they reached this milestone (1895-96 and 1898-99), they went on to win the league title.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Canvot, Lacroix, Guéhi; Rodney, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Johnson, Pino; Mateta\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Martínez; Cash, Konsa, Lindelöf, Maatsen; Kamara, Tielemans; McGinn, Rogers, Buendía; Watkins\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports+. Coverage begins at 18:00 GMT, with the game kicking off at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead more- Pep Guardiola reacts to Ruben Amorim sacking by Man Utd\n\nSee Also- Two surprise Man Utd candidates emerge as new manager search underway\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "“Now that he finds himself amid the bright lights of the Premier League, why shouldn’t he continue along the same path?”",
    "fullText": "Want an illustration of how quickly time seems to pass by in football terms — or simply graphic proof of how radically things have evolved at Sunderland in recent years?\n\nThe picture below was taken just under three years ago, during a game in which a ridiculously youthful Chris Rigg was denied what would’ve been a fairytale FA Cup goal against Fulham at Craven Cottage and everyone started to sit up and take notice of the latest exciting talent to roll off the Academy of Light’s production line.\n\nDuring the intervening three years, a hell of a lot has changed at the Stadium of Light.\n\nTony Mowbray was temporarily replaced by Mike Dodds, Michael Beale was hired and succeeded as head coach by Mike Dodds and then Régis Le Bris, and the entire process — often difficult and frustrating — eventually led to the promised land of Premier League promotion, with Rigg earning the right to call himself a top flight footballer after a red and white rise that’s encompassed memorable goals, eye-catching performances and plenty of excitement about what he could eventually achieve.\n\nOf course, the dynamic is very different now and if the Sunderland side in which Rigg made his first team debut was talented if somewhat unbalanced and lacking depth in key areas, the team in which he’s currently fighting to establish himself in is of a far higher standard.\n\nUnder Le Bris, Sunderland are competitive in the Premier League and after a heavyweight summer recruitment drive, Rigg is now surrounded by elite talents in more or less every position. As such, the former prodigy is entering the next stage of his development — one during which we all hope his rate of progress will continue.\n\nI firmly believe that at this stage and for the good of his future prospects, Rigg is exactly where he needs to be.\n\nIt’s true that he’s often been played outside of his “natural” position and although he always gives his all when deployed on the wing, it’s obvious that his skillset is best suited to the number ten position, albeit with Enzo Le Fée arguably our leading light in that particular role. That’s not necessarily problematic in itself — this league demands far greater quality and depth, after all — and for Rigg, perhaps it’ll simply be a matter of patience, discipline and seeing the bigger picture.\n\nGiven that he comes across as a single-minded, grounded and extremely driven young footballer, one would hope that the presence of such talent within the Sunderland camp is inspiring Rigg, driving him on and ensuring he keeps his eyes on the goal of constant improvement.\n\nIn my view, one thing is absolutely certain: Rigg should not be loaned out this month and if we arrive at the end of the transfer window having bade a temporary farewell to this immensely talented prospect, it would be detrimental to his own personal development and would also deprive Sunderland of a valuable option; someone who could play an important role during the final months of the season.\n\nDespite the impressive way in which we overhauled the squad during the summer, the long-standing argument of “He’s not ready for the Premier League” is ringing increasingly hollow, as is the notion that we should send a gifted player to the Championship on the basis they need to “toughen up”. In fact, it’s not too dissimilar to the stuff we used to hear as starry-eyed kids back in the Russell Foster days: “This player or that player won’t make it because they’re too small”, and so on.\n\nSuch has been the explosion of talented teenagers in recent years that if you haven’t established yourself by the age of twenty or so, you’re viewed as being behind the curve, but that’s a red herring.\n\nIt’s a universal truth that different players develop at different rates, and the idea of such a quality footballer being farmed out and forced to mix it with the likes of Millwall and Stoke City on the basis that his development will be expedited as a result is fairly gruesome.\n\nRigg is currently training and playing within an elite, high-performance environment, with a coach and captain setting and driving high standards having implemented a style of football that demands a great deal from the squad.\n\nTo my mind, that’s the perfect place for him and I trust Le Bris and his coaching staff to continue to do the right thing — and for Rigg himself to continue to apply himself properly and make the most of any and all opportunities that he’s given.\n\nAs was the case back in 2023, the sky is the limit for Rigg and now that he finds himself amid the bright lights of the Premier League, why shouldn’t he continue along the same path? It’s all within his hands and I’m hopeful that he’ll do exactly that.",

    "fullText": "Wolves travel to Liverpool tonight while they seek to build on their first victory of the Premier League season.\n\nRob Edwards finally secured three points with a dominant 3-0 win over West Ham at the weekend, snapping a 19-game winless run. While they remain at the bottom of the table, the victory has injected vital confidence into the squad. Edwards must now address his side’s poor away record, as the Old Gold have yet to win on the road this term.\n\nRob Edwards manages several significant absentees but is boosted by some positive fitness updates. Hwang Hee-chan and João Gomes are both expected to be fit after overcoming knocks sustained in the win over West Ham. However, captain Toti remains sidelined, and Emmanuel Agbadou is away on AFCON duty with Ivory Coast. Rodrigo Gomes and Marshall Munetsi are also nearing returns but are unlikely to start tonight.\n\nThe visitors are expected to name a largely unchanged side following their impressive performance at Molineux. Jhon Arias, who scored his first goal for the club last time out, will likely continue in midfield alongside André and Mateus Mane. Notably, Hwang Hee-chan reached 30 Premier League goal involvements for the club at the weekend and will be the focal point of the attack alongside Jorgen Strand Larsen. Edwards will be relying on this pair to end Wolves’ open-play goal drought away from home.\n\nWolves predicted XI: Sá; S. Bueno, Mosquera, Krejčí; Tchatchoua, Arias, André, Mané, H. Bueno; Arokodare, Larsen\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Hill Dickinson Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

Their away form isn’t nearly as good, which is another sign of how impressive this record is since they sit on thirty points as they occupy seventh in the table – only ahead of us on goal difference.\n\nEveryone thought the bubble had burst when Thomas Frank left to take the Spurs job, but Andrews has defied all of the predictions, although the pressure is firmly on holding their form at hom,e as only the bottom four have lost more than Brentford.\n\nIn all competitions, we’ve only taken on tonight’s opposition on twenty occasions. In the forty years between meetings in the league that ranged from 1947 and 1987, we took them on twice, once in the FA Cup and once in the League Cup and this is only our fourth trip to Griffin Park for a league game in the last forty years – the first in the top flight since 1946.\n\nIn the last four games, Le Bris’ side has shown how hard we are to beat; tonight we may need a similar performance.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 16/5 to win the game, while Brentford are priced at 4/5, and the draw is 5/2.\n\n[Yennaris 8’, Jozefzoon 47’, Maupay 78’ – Grabban 13’, Bentley (OG) 40’, Grabban (pen) 45’]\n\nSunderland: Steele, Jones, Kone, O’Shea, Oviedo, Watmore (McManaman), Cattermole, Ndong, McGeady (Vaughan), Honeyman, Grabban (Vaughan) Substitutes not used: Ruiter, Matthews, Gibson, Rodwell\n\nBrentford: Bentley, Dalsgaard, Clarke, Dennaris, Egan, Bjelland, Jozefzoon, Woods, Vibe (Maupay), Sawyers (McEachran), Watkins (Canos) Substitutes not used: Daniels, Barbet, Mepham, Mokotjo\n\nThey’re strong at home, and I think it will come down to the only goal of the game.",

    "description": "Calum McFarlane’s Blue and White Army",
    "fullText": "Chelsea’s new head coach, Liam Rosenior is expected to be in attendance but will not leading the team just yet as the Blues make the short trip down the road to Craven Cottage, to take on friendly rivals Fulham. Instead of Rosenior, it will be interim head coach Calum McFarlane calling the shots, and hopefully just as effectively as he did over the weekend, when he engineered a very credible 1-1 draw away against Manchester City.\n\nAlas, the only team to truly benefit from that draw were Arsenal, who now have a six point lead at the top of the table, just past the halfway mark of the season.\n\nFor Chelsea, it’s now just one win in our last eight Premier League matches, collecting just eight points from the 24 on offer. Somehow we’re still in fifth, but we’re going to have to start picking up points if we want to remain in the Champions League places by season’s end.\n\nDate / Time: Wednesday, January 7, 19.30 GMT; 2:30pm EST; 1am IST (next day)\nVenue: Craven Cottage, SW6\nReferee: Peter Bankes (on pitch); John Brooks (VAR)\nForecast: Partly sunny and a slight breeze; no more snow sadly\n\nOn TV: Sky Sports Football (UK); none (USA); Star Sports Select HD2 (India); none (NGA); elsewhere\nStreaming: Sky Go (UK); Peacock (USA); JioHotstar (India); DStv Now, SuperSport GOtv (NGA)\n\nFulham team news: It’s been a decent festive period for midtable (as usual) Fulham, getting draws against Liverpool and Crystal Palace and wins against West Ham and Nottingham Forest. Their draw against Liverpool, last time out, saw both teams score in added-on time, with Fulham equalizing on a most unlikely Goal of the Season worldie from Harrison Reed: just his fourth goal in over 200 appearances for the club.\n\nHARRISON REED GOAL FROM ALL OF THE ANGLES WHAT A GOAL 😮‍💨👏🏻pic.twitter.com/DZGfsF6Srw\n\n— KinG £ (@xKGx__) January 4, 2026\n\nAnd they’ve done all that despite losing a trio of key players to Nigeria at the Africa Cup of Nations (Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey, and Samuel Chukwueze), and missing a few others through injury (Josh King, Kenny Tete, and Rodrigo Muniz). In better news for them, Ryan Sessegnon looks set to return from a hamstring problem.\n\nManager Marco Silva is weary of the mental and physical tolls these games have taken on his players, though such concerns can fall by the wayside when it comes to special derbies (even friendly ones), especially when one side may feel wronged by a certain decision (i.e. Josh King’s goal getting ruled in the reverse fixture at the Bridge earlier this season).\n\n“It’s special. It’s special, because we know what’s happened. […] It really hurt ourselves, our fans, this football club, the way we were not able to win the game at Stamford Bridge. The way the team performed almost perfectly first half, in a really tough game against a top, top side, the way the team performed, and everything that happened in that game, really hurt this football club. I’m not talking about one or two persons, or just the players – us, the football club, the way that things happened that Saturday morning.\n\n“It is what it is – now it’s another opportunity for us to enjoy, to embrace a big challenge with our fans to play a derby like a derby should be played. Simple as that. It’s a new game, a new story. I don’t want anyone to think about the past, we have to look for the future, and what’s going to be most important is the next one. It’s a special game.”\n\n-Marco Silva; \n\nChelsea team news: Robert Sánchez and Wesley Fofana were both late scratches over the weekend, with injury and illness, respectively, but they are both back in training and in contention to start. Same goes for Marc Cucurella, who’s barely ever injured, but has missed the last couple games with a hamstring concern. We also welcome back Moisés Caicedo from his latest suspension.\n\nLevi Colwill, Dário Essugo, and Roméo Lavia remain out. The club recently wished Mykhailo Mudryk a happy birthday on social media, so we should probably mention the suspended winger here as well. How’s the appeals process going, Misha?\n\nMcFarlane will be hoping to hand over the reigns to Rosenior with the team back on the right path.\n\n“[This is a] really talented group, young, hungry, have shown they can play at the top top level against top top sides. Anyone associated with the club should be proud of their performance on Sunday and moving forward, this team has massive, massive potential so we should all be excited.”\n\n-Calum McFarlane; \n\nPreviously: Last season, we went to Craven Cottage on a low and came back on an absolute high. Tyrique George’s late equalizer and Pedro Neto’s even-later winner galvanized the team into a scorching hot run of form and results, culminating in not only a top-four finish but winning the FIFA Club World Cup later that summer.",

    "fullText": "Marco Brescianini is emerging as one of the most sought-after midfielders ahead of the January window, with interest now extending beyond Serie A to the Premier League.\n\nThe Atalanta midfielder is believed to be considering a move away from Bergamo in search of regular playing time, and several clubs are monitoring his situation closely.\n\nFiorentina and Lazio have both shown concrete interest in recent weeks, but they are no longer alone in the race.\n\nPARIS, FRANCE – SEPTEMBER 17: Marco Brescianini of Atalanta BC runs with the ball whilst under pressure from Ibrahim Mbaye of Paris Saint-Germain during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Phase MD1 match between Paris Saint-Germain and Atalanta BC at Parc des Princes on September 17, 2025 in Paris, France. (Photo by Franco Arland/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Tuttomercatoweb, via FirenzeViola, Bournemouth have also made an initial enquiry.\n\nThe Premier League side are understood to be gathering information at this stage rather than pushing ahead with a formal bid, but their involvement adds further competition.\n\nBournemouth’s interest is being driven by sporting director Tiago Pinto, a familiar figure in Italian football.\n\nAtalanta’s stance will be crucial.\n\nLECCE, ITALY – AUGUST 19: Marco Brescianini of Atalanta celebrates after scoring his team’s opening goal during the Serie A match between Lecce and Atalanta at Stadio Via del Mare on August 19, 2024 in Lecce, Italy. (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)\n\nThe club are not inclined to sanction a simple loan move and would instead seek an obligation to buy tied to conditions, or potentially a permanent transfer outright. That position could complicate negotiations for clubs hoping for a low-risk deal.\n\nWith Brescianini keen to find space and Atalanta open to evaluating offers on their terms, developments are expected in the coming days.\n\nThe midfielder appears increasingly likely to move on, but only if the right formula is found.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s reported long-standing interest in Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi could hit a snag: another top European club could beat it to the punch this month.\n\nThe German Rekordmeister had been tipped for contract talks with the English international, who is now in the final six months of his current deal and free to negotiate with other clubs as a free agent. However, a run of injuries to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City defense has created the possibility of an immediate transfer, according to reporting in the BBC.\n\nManchester City are exploring a move for Marc Guéhi this month, in the wake of defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias suffering injuries. Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter and Atlético are among the European clubs to have shown an interest in signing Guéhi on a free transfer. Liverpool remain heavily interested. It is understood Crystal Palace would consider selling Guéhi this month to avoid the scenario of losing their captain for nothing come the end of the season. Market regulations mean he can sign a pre-agreement with an overseas club from this month [@SamiMokbel_BBC, @BBCSport]\n\nMan City has dropped points again this weekend, this time to Chelsea, and is seeing its campaign to keep the pressure on Arsenal falter. The Gunners sit six points atop the league after 20 matchdays. Guéhi surely would not come cheap, but the incentives are aligning for all parties involved — and Bayern is in no position at the moment to throw in a bid. If Pep wants Guéhi, it is hard to see this not happening.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

I will rise again, better than ever.\"\n\nMeanwhile, City have recalled academy product Max Alleyne from his loan spell at Championship side Watford and he could be involved in the squad for Wednesday's Premier League game against Brighton.\n\nThe 20-year-old - son of former England cricketer and current Gloucestershire head coach Mark Alleyne - made 17 appearances for the Hornets after joining on a season's loan.\n\nBut with England centre-back John Stones also currently sidelined, that deal has been cut short as Pep Guardiola's side, who are exploring a January move for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi, try to tackle their growing injury crisis in defence.",

Also, where they are at as a dressing room – have they lost a bit of faith in the manager and what he is doing?\n\n\"They are in a position now where if Nottingham Forest were to beat them, you just start to worry.\n\n\"The problem you get with the new signings coming in too is they have not played in the Premier League, so it is how quickly they can adapt and play under pressure.\n\n\"There is huge pressure at that football club at the moment.\"\n\nEx-Aston Villa and Brentford head coach Dean Smith agreed and added: \"They've got new signings but I never think January is a great month for signings. There becomes a slight desperation when you're looking to bring players in.\n\n\"But they definitely need some players just to have fresh faces in the dressing room because they need a bit of change at the moment.\n\n\"I do [think Nuno is the one to get them out of trouble]. He knows the league, he's been in the league a long time, getting Wolves promoted a long time ago and he did so well at Nottingham Forest last year too.\n\n\"[But] nine games without a win and they need to turn that around quickly. The game against Forest on Wednesday is massive, they can't lose that.\"\n\nListen to the full discussion from 01:50:00 on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Chelsea's first black player, Paul Canoville, says the expected appointment of Liam Rosenior as manager offers \"hope\".\n\nRosenior is set to become the 12th black manager in the Premier League and the fifth permanent black British boss in England's top flight.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, Canoville said: \"Liam Rosenior is a quality coach who knows the game inside out, and that's what matters most. I want to wish him and his staff all the best. We need them to succeed – simple as that.\n\n\"But, as Chelsea's first black player, I would be lying if I said this doesn't move me. I broke ground back in the day and faced things no player should face, just because of the colour of my skin.\"\n\nCanoville, who was subjected to racist abuse in the 1990s after making his Chelsea debut, now works closely with the club through his charitable foundation and has seen changes since his playing days.\n\n\"Since then, we've had trailblazers: Paul Elliott, the first black captain; Ken Monkou, the first black player of the year and Ruud Gullit showing we could manage at the highest level,\" he said.\n\n\"What really strikes me about Liam is that he grew up and played not far from here – he knows this community. His dad Leroy has an MBE for his work tackling discrimination in sport. That's exactly what we do at The Paul Canoville Foundation with young people every day.\n\n\"When kids see someone like Liam managing their club – someone who looks like them, who's from their area, who comes from a family that fights for what's right – that's powerful. It shows them the path is there.\n\n\"So yes, it's a massive moment for the club, for London and for every young person dreaming big. But let's back Liam and let the man do his work.\"",

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim was sacked by Manchester United on Monday, bringing a dramatic end to his turbulent spell as manager of the struggling Premier League giants.\n\nThe dismissal of the Portuguese follows growing tensions between Amorim and the Old Trafford hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox, in recent days.\n\nThe club, sixth in the Premier League after a 1-1 draw at Leeds on Sunday, issued a statement saying Amorim had \"departed his role as head coach of Manchester United\".\n\n\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,\" the club said.\n\n\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\n\n\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"\n\nCurrent under-18s coach Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against struggling Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nAmorim was fired less than 24 hours after making a string of eye-catching comments at Elland Road, where he stressed he was United's manager rather than \"just the coach\", having hinted at frustration behind the scenes on Friday.\n\nThe Portuguese told the scouting department and Wilcox \"to do their job\" during a blockbuster end to a post-match press conference that raised major doubts over his future.\n\nAmorim repeatedly suggested to the media that he would leave when his contract expired in 18 months' time.\n\nBut reports said United's decision to axe their manager was due to the lack of evolution and progress during his 14-month tenure rather than a power struggle.\n\nIt is a dismal end to the reign of Amorim, who won just 25 of his 63 games at the helm in all competitions.\n\nIn the Premier League he had the worst win ratio (32 percent), the worst goals-conceded-per-game ratio (1.53) and the lowest clean-sheet ratio (15 percent) of any United manager.\n\nAmorim arrived at Old Trafford to replace Erik ten Hag in November 2024 as one of the most sought-after coaches in world football following a successful stint at Sporting Lisbon, where he won two league titles.\n\nBut he struggled badly in his first season in charge as United slumped to a 15th-place finish in the Premier League -- their worst campaign for 51 years.\n\nAmorim led the team to the Europa League final in Bilbao in May but they lost to Tottenham, meaning they missed out on European football this season.\n\nUnited have made marginal improvements during the current campaign but have been inconsistent, winning just eight of their 20 league games so far, and are 17 points behind leaders Arsenal.\n\nAmorim's stint is the shortest reign of a permanent manager at United since David Moyes was sacked just eight months into his tenure in 2014.\n\nThe club, 20-time English champions, have not won the Premier League since 2013, in Alex Ferguson's final season in charge.\n\nFormer United midfielder Fletcher was the club's technical director between 2021 and 2024, but he has never held a senior coaching position.",
