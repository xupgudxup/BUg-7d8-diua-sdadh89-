    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly set to challenge Bayern Munich for the signing of Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\nThis one will have Chelsea fans laughing right away, because it is yet another Brighton player they are being linked with!\n\nObviously with sporting director Paul Winstanley, who seems to have all the power at the club, being an ex-Brighton staff member, a lot of their new signings and staff members have come from this club over recent times.\n\nAnd now, it looks like they might be looking at signing yet another player from the Premier League club, although I’m not sure I see too much in this one personally.\n\nBart Verbruggen in action for Brighton against Chelsea. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nChelsea are gearing up to challenge Bayern Munich for the signing of Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen and crucially.\n\nAccording to a report from TEAMtalk this week, The Blues are prepared to match the Seagulls’ £50million tag.\n\nThe report also claims that Paul Winstanley and head of global goalkeeping Ben Roberts both carried out extensive work on Verbruggen during their time at Brighton.\n\nBrighton would demand in excess of £50million for Verbruggen, a figure Chelsea are apparently prepared to negotiate with.\n\nNicolas Jackson is not having a great time in Bayern Munich at the moment, only playing a bit-part role there out on loan. He was even left out of the latest match day squad for them yesterday, signalling a sign that actually, they don’t even rate him that highly and he will not be staying there beyond the summer.\n\nIt looks like we might finally see defender Mamadou Sarr in action on Friday night since his return to the club in the January window. Sarr is expected to either start or play some minutes in the FA Cup game vs Hull City!",

    "fullText": "Arsenal travel to Brentford on Thursday night, aiming to preserve their six-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nThe Gunners have moved into February with immense momentum, following four consecutive victories that have solidified their title charge. Manager Mikel Arteta oversaw a dominant 3–0 success over Sunderland last weekend, ending the day nine points clear before Manchester City’s late comeback at Anfield. Arsenal arrive in West London seeking a fourth consecutive clean sheet, a defensive feat they last achieved during a record-breaking streak in late 2024.\n\nMikel Arteta navigates fitness concerns regarding several key creative figures. Notably, a persistent hip injury keeps Bukayo Saka on the sidelines. Furthermore, Martin Ødegaard remains a major doubt after missing the last two matches with a minor muscle issue. Consequently, Kai Havertz likely retains his place in a deeper midfield role. Leandro Trossard adds to the headache; he limped off against Sunderland with a calf injury.\n\nDavid Raya starts in goal. Riccardo Calafiori likely features in the defensive line ahead of him, though Piero Hincapie offers a viable alternative. In midfield, Declan Rice and Martin Zubimendi aim to dictate the tempo. Up front, Viktor Gyökeres returns to the starting lineup. He scored twice off the bench last weekend. Gabriel Martinelli and Noni Madueke support him in a revamped attack.\n\nArsenal predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday, 12 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nLive television coverage will be available in the UK on TNT Sports 1. Extended highlights will be shown on Match of the Day on Friday night.\n\nArsenal predicted lineup vs Brentford.

    "fullText": "Premier League leaders Arsenal travel to the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday night, aiming to banish a peculiar midweek curse and maintain their six-point advantage at the top of the table.\n\nThe Gunners arrive in West London having “banished their January blues,” recording four consecutive wins across all competitions, including a clinical 3–0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday. However, Mikel Arteta’s side faces a historical hurdle: despite an impressive overall midweek record, Arsenal have failed to win—or even score—in any of their last three Premier League games played specifically on a Thursday. Standing in their way is a high-flying Brentford side that has emerged as the season’s “surprise package”. Under Keith Andrews, the seventh-placed Bees have won their last two matches, including a dramatic 3–2 triumph at St James’ Park last weekend.\n\nDate: Thursday, 12 February 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Arsenal 2–0 Brentford (2 Dec 2025), Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews remains without Kevin Schade, who serves the second of a three-match suspension for violent conduct. Reiss Nelson is ineligible to face his parent club, while long-term absentees Fabio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries. After a strong showing in Newcastle, the Bees are expected to remain largely unchanged, though Yehor Yarmolyuk is pushing for a start in midfield.\n\nMikel Arteta faces several late fitness calls. Bukayo Saka (hip) and Martin Ødegaard (muscle) both missed the Sunderland win and remain doubtful for the derby. Leandro Trossard is also a major doubt after sustaining a calf issue late against the Black Cats. However, Viktor Gyökeres is poised for a recall to the starting XI after his decisive brace off the bench last weekend.\n\nThe Gunners have maintained a high level of performance in local fixtures. Notably, Arsenal have lost just one of their last 23 Premier League London derbies (W17 D5). Defensively, they arrive in peak condition, having kept three consecutive clean sheets in all competitions heading into Thursday’s clash. However, the “Thursday curse” remains a concern, as the team has failed to score in their last three league outings on this specific day.\n\nThe Bees have turned their home ground into a nightmare for visitors. Notably, Igor Thiago has been in sensational form, netting nine goals in his last 10 home matches—a tally bettered only by Erling Haaland this season. Brentford also boast a clinical edge, with an xG per shot of 0.16, the best by any Premier League team in the last five seasons. While they are winless in eight against the Gunners, their current form suggests they are more than capable of an upset.\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Van den Berg, Ajer, Henry; Janelt, Henderson; Ouattara, Jensen, Lewis-Potter; Thiago\n\nArsenal Predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe match will be televised live in the UK on TNT Sports 1, with coverage starting at 19:00 GMT ahead of the 20:00 kick-off. Fans in the United States can stream the action exclusively on Peacock Premium.\n\nRead more- Lineker jokes that Mainoo should sue former Man United boss Amorim\n\nSee Also- Every Premier League team ranked by their five-year net spend\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest sacked manager Sean Dyche on Wednesday after a dismal draw with Wolves left them hovering above the Premier League relegation zone.\n\n\"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that Sean Dyche has been relieved of his duties as head coach,\" the club said in a statement on X.\n\n\"We would like to thank Sean and his staff for their efforts during their time at the club and we wish them the best of luck for the future.\"\n\nForest's 0-0 home draw with bottom club Wolves left them just three points clear of the bottom three.\n\nSpeaking after Wednesday's stalemate, a gloomy Dyche acknowledged his job was in peril, and that volatile owner Evangelos Marinakis could well decide to swing the axe.\n\nMarinakis has already sacked Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Postecoglou this season, and his patience once again wore thin after Forest drew a blank despite having 35 shots.\n\nDyche's team were booed off at the final whistle.\n\nDyche said he was a \"realist\" about his precarious situation and spoke like a manager resigned to his fate.\n\n\"The owner has been fair to me, without a shadow of a doubt,\" he said. \"If anyone chooses to change in football now, that's their decision. We've all seen it,\" he said.\n\n\"If the owner wants to make a change, then that's up to him, and that's the way football is now, that's just the reality of it.\n\n\"He's been absolutely fair with me from the beginning to the end, and I've been fair with him and told him the truth every step of the way.\"\n\nForest thrived under Nuno last season, securing a place in the Europa League, but the Portuguese coach was dismissed after falling out with Marinakis over transfers.",

    "description": "The Clarets' remarkable first-half fightback keeps alive their slim hopes of Premier League survival, but where does it leave Crystal Palace?",
    "fullText": "When Burnley fans first heard the news that their team bus had been caught up in traffic on the way to Selhurst Park – and that their game at Crystal Palace would be delayed by 10 minutes as a result – they may have been fearing the worst.\n\nAfter all, this was hardly ideal preparation for a team lying second bottom in the Premier League table, 11 points adrift of safety and without a win in their last 16 top-flight games.\n\nWith 12 minutes of the first half remaining, by which time Jorgen Strand Larsen's double had helped Palace breeze into a 2-0 first-half lead, the Clarets faithful will have been resigned to another bruising defeat, continuing their agonising slide back towards the Championship.\n\nTuesday's encounter had been following a familiar script. Parker's team had not only given away two easy goals, they had failed to register a shot on target in the first 39 minutes of the contest.\n\nThe seven that followed had to be seen to be believed.\n\nHannibal Mejbri made it 2-1 with his first goal of the season, before Jaidon Anthony arrowed a low shot into the corner to bring Burnley level four minutes later.\n\nBurnley's extraordinary comeback was complete in first-half stoppage time, when goalkeeper Dean Henderson parried Bashir Humphreys' header on to the foot of Jefferson Lerma and into the net to spark jubilant, almost disbelieving scenes in the away end.\n\nThis extraordinary result may prove too little, too late for the Clarets in their battle to avoid relegation.\n\nBut it was just the tonic for manager Scott Parker, who was subjected to chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'you're getting sacked in the morning' by his own supporters during last weekend's defeat by West Ham at Turf Moor.\n\n'Up to owner to make change' - Dyche under major scrutiny\n\nWill West Ham make 40-point mark crucial in relegation fight?\n\nHaving endured one of his toughest afternoons of his Burnley tenure on Saturday, Parker looked like he was trying to keep a lid on his emotions after Tuesday's astonishing victory.\n\nBut you could hear the fierce pride in Parker's voice as he spoke about his players' heroics in his post-match interview with TNT Sports.\n\n\"There aren't many teams who would come back here after going 2-0 down,\" he said. \"It speaks absolute volumes for this group.\n\n\"If there was ever any question about how together this group is, how committed this group is, how resilient this group is – [tonight] said it all, really.\"\n\nParker's team remain nine points adrift of safety with only 12 matches of the 2025/26 season left to play.\n\nBut neither Parker, nor his players have given up hope of mounting a late survival charge.\n\n\"There has always been belief [that we can stay up],\" he continued. \"The results over the last few months probably haven't gone our way, but tonight that definitely was the case,\" he said.\n\n\"Coming off the back of an incredibly tough game for us at the weekend – for many reasons – that performance showed a group that is full of resilience, full of commitment.\n\n\"You don't get that result without proper resilience, standing up to certain battles and certain situations. The biggest lesson for any group is to keep coming back up.\n\n\"We certainly did that tonight.\"\n\nSo where does Tuesday's result leave Palace?\n\nIn stark contrast to his opposite number, Oliver Glasner looked ashen-faced when he addressed the media after the full-time whistle, which was greeted by loud boos from the Palace supporters.\n\nHaving watched his team arrest a 12-match winless run against arch rivals Brighton last time out, Glasner looked set to mark his 100th match in charge of the club with another morale-boosting win after Strand Larsen's double.\n\nBut Palace froze after Mejbri had pulled a goal back for Burnley, who took full advantage of the hosts' inertia to inflict one of the most painful defeats of the Austrian's Selhurst Park tenure.\n\n\"It's not acceptable,\" Glasner, who is leaving the club in the summer, told TNT Sports. \"I can't explain it. Maybe [the first 39 minutes] were too easy.\n\n\"The start was very good. We controlled everything, [but] I've watched all the goals back and it's just not acceptable how we defended as a team – just jogging around, not in the duels, not in the second balls.\"\n\nAnother issue, according to Glasner, is the presence of a Marc Guehi-sized hole in the Palace defence.\n\nThe England defender left for Manchester City for an initial £20m last month in a move which incurred the wrath of Glasner, who announced his own departure not long afterwards.\n\n\"Right now, we don't have someone on the pitch who leads the team in these moments, who makes players calm and decides the meaning of the game,\" he said.\n\n\"I praise the boys very often for their effort. When you throw the game away like we did, you don't deserve to win.\"\n\nPalace are still eight points above the bottom three – a sizeable cushion, but one not comfortable enough for a side with only one win in all competitions since 11 December.\n\nDefeat at home to Wolves in their next league game really would set alarm bells ringing.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola vowed his Manchester City side would \"breathe down the neck of Arsenal\" as they aim to hunt down the Premier League leaders in this fascinating title race.\n\nThey backed up Sunday's astonishing comeback victory at champions Liverpool by taking apart Fulham in the first half on Wednesday night.\n\nGuardiola's men have started to gain momentum and now trail the Gunners by just three points with an intriguing battle developing between the top two.\n\nMikel Arteta's side travel to tricky Brentford on Thursday hoping to regain their six-point advantage but go into the game under pressure knowing City did their job in style.\n\nGuardiola, though, was not getting drawn into title talk at this stage of the season, saying: \"We were not nine points [adrift] before Anfield, we are not three points [adrift] before Brentford v Arsenal, after that we will see.\n\n\"I always say the focus is to grow, grow, grow. It's how we can be more consistent over 90 minutes, how we can be better and the players feel that [they are] doing what we want to do.\n\n\"'We can do it in terms of mentality and patterns defensively and offensively. We are doing that.\"\n\nMan City beat Fulham to close to three points on Arsenal\n\nThe celebrations between a group of City players at full-time to preserve a clean sheet epitomised the togetherness that has been forged and the character they are able to display.\n\nThe result at Anfield appears to have given City and Guardiola renewed belief that they are capable of chasing down Arsenal, despite not being at their rampant best this season.\n\nCity have the know-how of getting the job done, having been top dogs in six of the past eight seasons, while Arsenal will be hoping there isn't a familiar story to the past three campaigns when they have finished runners-up.\n\nFormer Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Radio Live: \"There are still fragilities we haven't seen in the past perhaps, but they still have the armoury I think to go on a crazy run now and be unbeaten and all that stuff.\n\n\"It's not that big of a statement to say that. The manner in which they won on Sunday, the psychological side. They have gone 'this is ours for the taking'.\n\n\"The belief runs through the whole club and fans where they think, 'do you know what, we still have a great chance'. That will give them belief for this run-in.\"\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer added on BBC Match of the Day: \"I don't think it would surprise many people if they went on a run. Particularly after the game at the weekend, you could see they were full of confidence, belief and energy.\n\n\"They have done their job tonight and put the pressure back on Arsenal with a three-point gap now.\"\n\nThe weight of expectation will lie heavily on Arsenal's shoulders before facing the Bees, with an uncomfortable night's sleep in store after seeing City take apart Fulham in a clinical first-half showing.\n\nBut Arsenal know they can respond by claiming three points at the G Tech Stadium and if they follow it up by beating bottom side Wolves next Wednesday, the tantalising prospect of a nine-point lead awaits.\n\nThe two sides meet in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday 22 March with the chance of inflicting the first direct psychological blow.\n\nRecent history shows that seven of the last 12 winners of the EFL Cup have gone on to win at least one other trophy in the same season, highlighting the importance of claiming the trophy at Wembley next month.\n\nThey are scheduled to meet at Etihad Stadium in the Premier League in April but the rivalry could see them face each other another three times if they progress in both the Champions League and FA Cup.\n\nWhile Arsenal did not sign anyone in the January transfer window, City added Antoine Semenyo, who has scored five goals already, and England international Marc Guehi, who contributed to a clean sheet.\n\nGuardiola said his side are \"growing\", adding: \"We were together, more calm with the ball, we made inside, outside [runs]. I would say the position was not perfect for Nico O'Reilly and Phil [Foden] but sometimes it happens to be in better positions, but in general really pleased.\n\n\"We suffered a lot at Fulham and today, after physically and emotionally at Anfield, it is really tricky but we talked a lot and I said 'guys we have to do it again' and we did it.\"\n\nA long and arduous season is bound to take its toll at some stage and star striker Erling Haaland could do with a rest.\n\nThe Norwegian scored in Wednesday's 3-0 win over Fulham to take his tally to 42 in as many games this season for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old, though, scored his first non-penalty league goal since 20 December against West Ham, ending a run of 24 shots from open play without scoring.\n\nBut he featured in only the first half against the Cottagers, being replaced by Omar Marmoush at half-time.\n\nGuardiola said the player was feeling some \"niggles\", adding: \"He [Haaland] said, 'I don't feel comfortable' and 3-0 [ahead] with a lot of games and having Omar, common sense [to subsititute him].",

    "title": "How much pressure is Slot really under at Liverpool?",
    "description": "Liverpool have won just once in the Premier League in 2026 - so will they stick with Arne Slot, who took them to the title last season?",
    "fullText": "Arne Slot afforded himself a little smile when he admitted that this was the toughest season in his career \"by a mile\" on Tuesday.\n\nNo matter what Slot achieves across the rest of his managerial days, this campaign has pushed the Dutchman to new limits.\n\nAfter romping to the Premier League title in his first season in charge at Liverpool, the second has seen Slot and his side face a barrage of \"setbacks\", \"hits\" and \"bad luck\" as he mentioned during his news conference on Tuesday. More on that later.\n\nThe raw numbers do not make for good reading. Since winning their first five league matches at the start of the season, Liverpool have taken just 24 points from their next 20 games.\n\nFor context, Roy Hodgson won 25 points from 20 games before he was sacked as Liverpool boss in 2010-11.\n\nIn 2026 alone, Liverpool have won just one of their seven league games and earlier this season, nine defeats in 12 games was their worst run of form in 71 years.\n\n\"They've been really bad champions\", was the verdict of Roy Keane on Sky Sports on Sunday, after Liverpool fell to their eighth league defeat of the season.\n\nPut simply, such numbers are not good enough for the reigning champions, particularly given their £450m summer spend, and Slot conceded as much when he said it would be not be acceptable if Liverpool failed to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nThat Liverpool are still in with a chance of qualifying is primarily due to the fact that rivals such as Chelsea and Manchester United have gone through torrid spells too.\n\nBoth those clubs have sacked their managers this season after a breakdown in the relationship between the coach and senior figures.\n\nIn Slot's case, there is serious credit in the bank. The 47-year-old is the only coach alongside Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola and Liverpool predecesor Jurgen Klopp to win the title since 2017-18.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in 2020-21, the season after Liverpool won the league under Klopp, they were eighth after 28 games but Klopp's future was never truly in doubt. They won 26 points from their last 30 available and ended up finishing third.\n\nHowever, in the 2022-23 season Klopp's side failed to qualify for the Champions League - something Slot says would \"not be acceptable\" this term.\n\nAsked what impact such a scenario would have on his own position, Slot replied: \"That is again a difficult question for me to answer because I don't decide on my future.\n\n\"The only thing I do know is that it happened before, and ­recently, and it didn't affect the future of that manager. But that doesn't guarantee anything, of course.\n\n\"In general, [with] managers, especially at this club - maybe somewhere else it is mainly, but not only, about results - they also look at the progress the players make, the progress the team makes, the circumstances are sometimes taken into account.\n\n\"That is not at all clubs, but I think I am working at a club that does look at those things. As it has shown in the past when the club did not qualify for the Champions League.\"\n\nTraditionally, Liverpool are not a club that sacks coaches and the understanding is that the Anfield hierarchy is behind Slot, until the end of the season at least.\n\nLast week, an in-house roundtable chat between Slot, sporting director Richard Hughes and CEO Billy Hogan was posted across Liverpool's social channels.\n\nAlthough it was filmed in mid-January, the video showcased a strong relationship between all. Hughes was of course instrumental in Slot's appointment and getting rid of him would mean admitting that it didn't work out.\n\nYet there is a clear awareness that performances and results must improve and Slot is aware of the pressure, both internally and externally.\n\nBoos aren't exactly the norm at Anfield but they have been heard more frequently this season.\n\nAway from the cameras, Slot is seen as calm, consistent and level-headed, but admissions that he finds it \"hard to hear\" claims that Liverpool's football has been \"dull\" speak of a man that is battling hard, and who is insistent his side can do \"something special\".\n\nThere is certainly mitigation for Liverpool's struggles. The death of Diogo Jota last summer was tragic and last week former Liverpool keeper Caoimhín Kelleher said that meant the football side of things was not important this season for Liverpool as players dealt with his loss.\n\nSlot said the meeting he held with the players after Jota's funeral was one of the most difficult things he's done in his life.\n\nNo one at the club will use Jota's passing as an excuse for their form but the impact of such a tragedy must be considered.\n\nLiverpool have also faced an injury crisis, including the long-term absences of Giovanni Leoni, Conor Bradley and Alexander Isak, while going through a squad transition that has focused on technical footballers, rather than physical signings.\n\nThe feeling behind that strategy is that long-term, the game will move towards a focus on possession, rather than the emphasis on physicality seen this season.\n\nThe form of key players dipping hasn't helped either, so a range of factors have combined to leave Liverpool where they are.\n\nRegardless, given the quality of players at their disposal, it is widely accepted that the defending champions are indeed \"not performing to Liverpool's standard\", as Slot has said.\n\nHis suggestion on Tuesday that Liverpool have only been outplayed in three halves this season was far-fetched, however.\n\nWhen a team loses eight and draws six out of 25 games, such a claim doesn't stand up.\n\n\"The question is are we unlucky or is it part of who we are? That is something we can only find out in the upcoming three to four months,\" Slot said, when asked about the bad luck his side have had.\n\nLiverpool still have the chance of silverware in the FA Cup and Champions League, but the minimum aim for the rest of the campaign will be to qualify for the Champions League next season.\n\nTheir financial model is based upon sustainability and there will be serious implications if they miss out.\n\nLike that Klopp side of 2020-21, they need to be \"close to perfection\" as Slot said from now on, starting with the trip to Sunderland on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, there is an elephant in the room after Xabi Alonso left his position as Real Madrid manager, with the former Liverpool midfielder touted as a possible replacement for Slot.\n\nHowever, given no manager in Liverpool's history has a better win percentage (61%) than Slot, it is understandable why, for now at least, he retains the club's backing.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Has Milner's record pursuit become a problem for Brighton?",
    "description": "James Milner is one game away from drawing level with Gareth Barry for most Premier League appearances, but has the record become a problem for Brighton?",
    "fullText": "Brighton midfielder James Milner is on the verge of equalling the all-time record for most Premier League appearances.\n\nThe current holder is former Aston Villa and Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry, who played in 653 top-flight games.\n\nMilner could draw level with Barry on Wednesday evening when Brighton are at Villa and while Seagulls fans will no doubt celebrate such a moment, there will also likely be a sense of relief.\n\nThat's because for some supporters there is a feeling that the 40-year-old Milner has been making late appearances off the bench just to edge closer to the record and not necessarily for the benefit of the team.\n\n\"Not for the first time this season, Fabian Hurzeler made a substitution involving James Milner [against Fulham recently] which made little sense,\" Seagulls fan Scott McCarthy, of We are Brighton, said.\n\n\"That adds to the feeling, Milner is being gifted appearances so he can break the Premier League record.\n\n\"Hurzeler bringing on Milner at Anfield back in December, for example, was clearly done for another tick in the box and a nice reception from the home crowd.\n\n\"The token substitution did not go down well at the time.\"\n\nThere is little doubt that Milner has made some crucial contributions to the teams he has played for over the years.\n\nHe has won multiple Premier League titles with Manchester City and Liverpool, as well as the Champions League with the Reds.\n\nAs he's got older his influence on the pitch has understandably declined and this season he has made 14 Premier League appearances, with 12 of those from off the bench.\n\nHe has scored one goal and provided one assist, but for many of those who have either played alongside him or seen him in action, Milner offers much more than that.\n\n\"He is someone you can rely on,\" former England and Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said.\n\n\"If you have a James Milner in your squad you want to keep hold of him.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Micah Richards added: \"He comes in training every single day.\n\n\"Sometimes you would come in and you want to relax, he was on you: 'Have you done this? Have you done that? What are you eating? What is your diet like?' But it was in a good way.\"\n\nMilner's 14 appearances this season make a total of 310 minutes on the pitch - meaning he is playing an average of 22 minutes per game.\n\nIn each of his last five Premier League appearances he has been sent on in the final 10 minutes, leading some fans to question whether his contribution has been worthwhile.\n\n\"As annoying as it was seeing a 39-year-old come on [against Liverpool] when Brighton had young players on the bench who could have benefited from the experience, at least the Albion were 2-0 down. It had no bearing on the outcome,\" added McCarthy.\n\n\"That was not the case against Fulham. Carlos Baleba had run the midfield with his best performance of the season. If Baleba was tiring, Hurzeler had Jack Hinshelwood on the bench to bring similar energy and drive.\n\n\"Instead, Hurzeler introduced Milner with 81 minutes played. 11 minutes later and Fulham scored their winner from a free-kick conceded in the exact area of the pitch Baleba had defended well all afternoon.\"\n\nThe frustration that some Brighton fans feel about Milner's late appearances off the bench - during which they perceive he offers little - will be compounded by the fact the Seagulls are on a poor run of form - with just one win in their last 12 Premier League games.\n\nJoe: I do not agree with the Milner vanity project. He should be a member of the coaching staff and not a member of the playing squad. We have younger, better options than him.\n\nBrian: Bringing Milner on towards the end of any game affects the balance of the midfield, usually causing unnecessary problems. I think the manager is just giving Milner an opportunity to beat record appearances rather than to improve team.\n\nGraham: Utter nonsense. Milner is brought on to shore up the midfield being a more defensive player and far more experienced than others.\n\nRozzer: Milner has represented the best of professionalism in English football for some time now. He has been a role model to thousands of youngsters in how he conducts himself on and off the pitch and he is deserving of this record. There will always be opportunity for him to do that this season without having too much impact on Albion. Well done Milner.\n\nShould Milner equal Barry's record on Wednesday evening, he will do so having played significantly fewer minutes than Barry did over his career.\n\nIn total, Barry spent 54,439 minutes on the pitch compared to 40,408 for Milner.\n\nHowever, it is about what you do with that time playing and Milner has certainly contributed plenty when he has played - scoring 56 goals and providing 90 assists.\n\nThose are statistics that compare favourably with Barry's record of 53 goals and 64 assists.\n\nMilner's longevity is certainly impressive.\n\nAlmost half the players to have played in the Premier League since it was formed in 1992-93 (5,094) have either played alongside or against Milner.\n\nSince his debut in the 2002-03 campaign, he has faced 99.9% of the 876 other players to have played at least 100 games in the last 24 Premier League seasons.\n\nThe only one of the above who has so far avoided facing Milner is Brentford's Nathan Collins, but that could change when the Bees play Brighton on 21 February.\n\nPlenty of Premier League managers have also become well acquainted with Milner over the decades. Including caretakers, he has made a Premier League appearance under 21 different managers – two more than any other player.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Fearing oblivion, sensing toxicity - Spurs reluctantly sack Frank",
    "description": "Tottenham sack Thomas Frank as head coach after a run of only two wins in 17 Premier League matches.",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank has been sacked by Tottenham after just under eight months in charge following their dismal 2-1 defeat at home against Newcastle on Tuesday.\n\nSpurs are 16th in the Premier League and just five points above the relegation zone following a dreadful run of form.\n\nThe north London side are winless in their past eight Premier League games - their longest run without a victory since October 2008.\n\nThey have won just two of their past 17 league matches and picked up only 12 points in that time.\n\nTottenham said they had been \"determined to give Frank the time and support needed to build for the future together\", but recent results meant \"a change at this point is necessary\".\n\nFrank took over as head coach in June after Ange Postecoglou was sacked and signed a deal until 2028, but proved unable to notably improve the club's league form despite strong results in European competition.\n\nAgainst a mixed Premier League record of seven wins, eight draws and 11 defeats this season, the Dane led Spurs to automatic qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League by finishing fourth in the group stage.\n\nHowever, they are out of both domestic cup competitions, having been beaten by Newcastle in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup in October and Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round last month.\n\n\"Throughout his time at the club, Thomas has conducted himself with unwavering commitment, giving everything in his efforts to move the club forward,\" Tottenham said.\n\n\"We would like to thank him for his contribution and wish him every success in the future.\"\n\nWhy Frank at Tottenham was a gamble that ended in bitter failure\n\nReaction after Frank sacked as Tottenham boss\n\nWho should Spurs appoint next? Have your say\n\nDespite the loss to Newcastle, Frank still expected to be in charge for the north London derby against Arsenal on 22 February.\n\nAsked by TNT Sports on Tuesday night if his job was under threat, Frank said: \"I spoke to them [the owners] yesterday, so no.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and the easiest thing is to point at me. That's part of the job unfortunately.\n\n\"I will work day and night to turn this around but it is not just one person. There is no doubt we need to improve and I need to be part of that.\"\n\nSpurs were loudly booed after the defeats at home by Newcastle and fellow strugglers West Ham in the past few weeks.\n\nFrank was also taunted by his own fans with chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" during the loss to West Ham and the 2-2 draw at Burnley that followed.\n\nAfter being booed off at half-time while 2-0 down to Manchester City, Frank's side responded to draw 2-2 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nCaptain Cristian Romero was critical of Tottenham's board after that result, calling it \"disgraceful\" that the club only had 11 fit senior players available against City.\n\nThe Argentine then received a straight red card - his second of the season - against Manchester United on 7 February, who went on to win 2-0.\n\nSpurs won five, drew two and lost just one of their eight Champions League group stage matches - that defeat coming away to holders Paris St-Germain.\n\nHowever, their Premier League form has been largely poor since November, including a damaging 4-1 defeat by north London rivals Arsenal and a woeful 3-0 loss at relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest.\n\nLast month Frank said he felt trusted by the board but BBC Sport understands he was already under significant internal scrutiny and at least one member of the club's executive had raised the option of ending his reign.\n\nTottenham took just 10 points at home in the league under Frank, but had a better away record, claiming 19 points from 13 matches on the road.\n\nPrior to joining Tottenham, Frank spent seven years in charge of Brentford, guiding the Bees from the Championship to the Premier League in 2021.\n\nThe 52-year-old's tenure at Spurs started with a Uefa Super Cup defeat on penalties by PSG, with Spurs having booked their place in the match courtesy of winning the Europa League under Australian Postecoglou last season.\n\nTottenham beat Burnley, Manchester City and West Ham in their opening four league games, while also beating Villarreal in the Champions League. But they could not build on that start and Frank's style of play never won over fans.\n\nHe was hampered by extensive injury issues this season though, with Lucas Bergvall, Ben Davies, Richarlison, Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison among those out long term.\n\nSpurs are also without suspended captain Romero for the next three Premier League matches.\n\nFor weeks it has been a case of when, not if, Thomas Frank went, despite the club's ownership and leadership team being determined to give Frank a proper go at turning things round.\n\nUltimately they deemed that, under Frank, Spurs were more likely to career into oblivion than stop the rot.\n\nTottenham were desperate for this appointment to work - they believe Frank is a good manager who was dealt a rough hand.\n\nHowever, the toxicity amongst the fanbase and the meek performances on the pitch meant the club had no option but to act.\n\nMoving forward, an interim appointment until the end of the campaign makes sense, as the managerial landscape will change drastically at the end of the season.\n\nThe most obvious development will be the potential availability of former boss Mauricio Pochettino after the World Cup.\n\nThe USA head coach has made no secret of his desire to return to the club one day and supporters have made clear their wishes for him to return.\n\nIt seems like a perfect match, but Spurs will have to wait until after the World Cup to appoint Pochettino.\n\nAnd if it isn't Pochettino, the likes of Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Marco Silva will be available for nothing in the summer, while World Cup coaches Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Julian Nagelsmann may also be obtainable.\n\nIn the meantime, Tottenham want Frank's immediate successor in place before the players return to training on Monday.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Tottenham manager Thomas Frank insists his job is not under threat despite dropping to five points from the Premier League relegation zone - but will the Dane avoid the sack?",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank insists his job is not under threat at Tottenham Hotspur, despite his side extending their winless run in the Premier League to eight matches.\n\nSpurs suffered their 11th defeat of the season with a 2-1 home loss to Newcastle on Tuesday night.\n\nIt leaves Tottenham, one of six ever-present Premier League clubs in the top flight, five points above the relegation zone.\n\nBut Frank says he has been assured his position as manager is safe.\n\nAsked by TNT Sports if his job is under threat, Frank said: \"I spoke to them [owners] yesterday, so no.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and the easiest thing is to point at me. That's part of the job unfortunately. I will work day and night to turn this around but it is not just one person. There is no doubt we need to improve and I need to be part of that.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about supporters booing at full-time, Frank added: \"I understand the frustration. It has been building up a little bit - last season it was similar playing in Europe and the Premier League.\n\n\"We need to be resilient, mentally and physically. I am 100% sure that it is a team effort, and it is not only one person. We are all aligned and we know what needs to be done.\"\n\nHaving taken 10 points from 15 in their first five Premier League fixtures under Frank, Spurs have managed just 19 from their next 21 matches.\n\nTheir run of eight games without a win is their longest since going nine without victory in 2008 under Juande Ramos - who was sacked with the club bottom of the table.\n\n\"You've got to say what it is and they are in a relegation fight,\" Spurs legend Glenn Hoddle told TNT Sports.\n\n\"The players have to understand that and the fans have to understand that.\n\n\"It is the reality and you have to scrap for every single point.\"\n\nBoos rang around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on the final whistle, while there were pockets of empty seats at kick-off.\n\n\"A lot of fans have lost faith in what Thomas Frank is doing here,\" added former Spurs striker Les Ferdinand.\n\n\"It is desperate times. And desperate times call for desperate measures.\"\n\nThe Tottenham hierarchy now have a huge decision to make.\n\nThomas Frank's future at the club is uncertain. That isn't a secret, of course - it has been the case for weeks.\n\nLarge sections of the supporters want him sacked. The boos that rang round Tottenham Hotspur Stadium at full-time were testament to that prevailing feeling from a disgruntled fanbase.\n\nCrucially, there has been a loss of support towards the Dane internally.\n\nSo, the fact Frank's disastrous first season in charge lurched to deeper depths following this defeat by Newcastle may have significant consequences.\n\nIf Nottingham Forest, who occupy 17th, beat Wolves on Wednesday night they will go level on points with Tottenham.\n\nFrank is understandably hesitant to admit his side are in relegation fight - but the numbers don't lie.\n\nThat said, it may not be Frank's problem for much longer - Tottenham's latest loss will push the beleaguered manager closer to what appears an inevitable exit.\n\nIndeed, such has been the level of contemplation regarding Frank's immediate future at Tottenham in recent weeks that this loss will almost certainly trigger further soul-searching from the club's leadership group.\n\nThe fact the Spurs board have stuck by Frank during such a difficult period proves they want the appointment to work.\n\nThe easier decision would have been to show Frank the door by now.\n\nHowever, the Tottenham hierarchy believe Frank has been dealt a rough hand.\n\nThere's an acknowledgment that the season has been disrupted by multiple injuries to key players.\n\nThere is also recognition that the squad needs repair work - particularly considering the departures of their two main sources of goals in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\n\nThere is also a sense behind the scenes that the squad is lacking in leadership. It was why they signed England international Conor Gallagher and tried to land Andy Robertson from Liverpool - both with plenty of Premier League experience.\n\nThere is also a sense from Tottenham's executive team that the club require a period of managerial stability.\n\nBut by the same token, sources have told BBC Sport that work towards a contingency plan in the event they make a decision they really don't want to make illustrates the precarity of Frank's position.\n\nIf the club decide to part with Frank in the immediate aftermath of this Newcastle defeat, they will have 12 days until their next fixture against Arsenal on 22 February.\n\nThat leaves Tottenham with a prolonged window to execute their replacement plan and leave Frank's successor with time to implement a blueprint for the north London derby.\n\nThe pressure on Frank is at breaking point. We are about to find out if Tottenham crack.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

Sporting director Richard Hughes spent £29m on Jeremie Frimpong after triggering the Bayer Leverkusen wing-back’s release clause.\n\nAnd he also offered a new contract to Conor Bradley. But those plans are up in smoke - with Frimpong on his third significant injury absence of the season and Bradley not expected to play again until next season owing to a complex knee injury of his own.\n\nTo add to Arne Slot’s woes Joe Gomez has been in and out of the lineup due to injuries and the head coach has been pressed into using Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and even Wataru Endo at right-back.\n\nIt’s very much a problem position for the defending Premier League champions and one which could well be solved in the summer transfer window.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nBecause a report in Sports Boom is now claiming that Liverpool are considering a move for Brentford’s breakout star - Michael Kayode.\n\n“Liverpool are considering a move for Brentford's right-back Michael Kayode,” the report reads.\n\n“The 21-year-old's performances have impressed Reds' boss Arne Slot, as Liverpool face an injury crisis in that position.\n\n“Kayode, who has been a revelation at Brentford, is also being monitored by other Premier League clubs like Manchester United and Newcastle United.”",

Their total of 33 points through 25 matches puts them 10 points back of fifth-place Chelsea, meaning a shot at a Champions League place next year is almost certainly out of the question.\n\nThe Sporting News is following the Tottenham vs. Newcastle match live, providing score updates, commentary, and analysis.\n\nMORE:Busting the myth that Arsenal are \"boring\" with their set-piece focus in the new tactical meta\n\nLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, England)\nReferee: Anthony Taylor\n\nKeep track of every game and every goal via SN's live Premier League scoreboard.\n\nTottenham (3-4-2-1, right to left): Vicario (GK) — Palhinha, Dragusin, Van de Ven — Gray, Gallagher, Sarr, Spence — Odobert, Simons — Solanke.\n\nNewcastle (4-3-3, right to left): Pope (GK) — Trippier, Thiaw, Botman, Hall — Guimaraes, Tonali, Willock — Elanga, Woltemade, Barnes.\n\n📲 Follow The Sporting News on WhatsApp\n\nFollowing the game, this section will be updated with analysis of the Tottenham vs. Newcastle match.\n\n1 hour to kickoff: Let's have a look at the starting lineups. Dan Burn, Jacob Ramsey and Anthony Elanga all come back in for Newcastle, who have Anthony Gordon leading the line and both Yoane Wissa and Nick Woltemade on the bench.\n\nHow we line-up at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this evening 💪 pic.twitter.com/gatlQw67nX\n\n— Newcastle United (@NUFC) February 10, 2026\n\n2 hours to kickoff: For the second straight season, Tottenham are experiencing polar opposite fortunes in Premier League and European competitions. While they sit 15th in the Premier League table 25 matches into Thomas Frank's debut season, they managed to secure a fourth-place finish in the league phase of Champions League action.\n\nThat's key for Frank who now gets room to breathe as they recover their Premier League position, not scheduled to compete in the Round of 16 in Europe until the middle of March. Thanks to their early FA Cup exit, Spurs won't play again after this match until February 22.\n\nWith a debilitatingly long injury list to push through, that extra time will be vital to get the squad back closer to full fitness.\n\nFollowing the game, this section will be updated with post-match reaction from Thomas Frank, Eddie Howe, and players.\n\nMORE:An in-depth rundown of all the latest Tottenham team news and injuries\n\nCristian Romero is suspended for four matches after his red card last time out against Manchester United. His challenge on Casemiro was deemed serious foul play, meaning a three-match ban. An additional game is added on to the suspension because it was Romero's second Premier League red card of the season.\n\nDestiny Udogie, Kevin Danso, Pedro Porro, and Djed Spence are all dealing with injuries. Spence is the only one with a chance to play in this match, while the others need a few more weeks.\n\nLong-term absentees include Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Bergvall and James Maddison, all of whom need until at least April before returning, if not longer.\n\nAnthony Gordon and Lewis Miley are both considered game-time decisions, with the former recovering from a minor hamstring injury and the latter working through a dead leg.\n\nJoelinton will not take part in this match, Eddie Howe confirmed, as he battles back from a groin injury.\n\nTino Livramento, Fabian Schar, and Emil Krafth are also out, with the latter potentially back soon while the other two need significantly more time before returning.\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, England)\n\nCraven Cottage (London, England)\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, England)\n\nVilla Park (Birmingham, England)\n\nChampions League (knockout playoffs — 1st leg)\n\nAzersun Arena (Baku, Azerbaijan)\n\nEtihad Stadium (Manchester, England)",

    "description": "Six months ago a win for Sunderland over the Premier League champions would have felt like pure fantasy, but on Wednesday we could actually do it, and go level on points with them. Let’s get stuck in!",
    "fullText": "Given that Sunderland are so very close to their points target from the start of the season, there’s a feeling — certainly from my perspective, anyway — that this game against Liverpool has slightly more riding on it than your usual Premier League outing.\n\nEvery time someone from within the club is asked about targets and achievable goals this season, there is a very clear and concise point made — all that we are focusing on and thinking about is reaching the magic forty-point mark. Right now we’re sat on 36, so we’re close, but we’re not quite there yet.\n\nThe fact that I’m even considering that we could get within touching distance of that with a win over Liverpool on Wednesday night is telling about how each club has performed this season. Arne Slot’s side, who were clearly the best team in the land last season and won the Premier League, are only three points ahead of us in the table. Victory on Wednesday night would put us level with the reigning Champions. An amazing thought.\n\nOf course, nothing is decided in February, and there’s a long way to go, but can you imagine what a win against such a brilliant side would do for our collective confidence heading into a much kinder-looking run of fixtures?\n\nThe daft thing is, I genuinely believe we can do it. Right now, Liverpool are a wounded animal, and they’ll still be hurting after losing to Manchester City on Sunday in a game they really ought to have gotten something from. Their talisman on that evening, Dominik Szoboszlai, is suspended, and there’s a glaring hole in the right-back position that Sunderland really ought to target and exploit. This is a great opportunity to earn a statement-making win over a side that I wouldn’t have dreamed of us beating six months ago.\n\nWe absolutely have to smell blood. Yes, Sunderland are the last remaining unbeaten Premier League home side, and with that comes the pressure to maintain our glittering spell of form, but you have to think that all the pressure is on Liverpool right now. They’ve got no chance of winning the league and retaining their title, but they’re in serious danger of completely blowing their season altogether. What if the unthinkable happens, and they fail to qualify for Europe? It may seem extreme, but it’s certainly possible, and these are the doubts that will be creeping into the minds of their players and coaching staff. I can’t imagine that after such a morale-sapping loss that they’ll be particularly looking forward to travelling up to the north-east on a Wednesday night to play against a team who has nothing to fear.\n\nMany supporters have quite rightly pointed out that there has been a change in the atmosphere at the Stadium of Light in our last two home games, but I just put that down to the fact that we were playing teams that we were expected to beat. That simply won’t be the case on Wednesday, and I think people will be really up for it against Liverpool, a side who may well not be at their best but are still expected to come and beat us. We thrive off being the underdog, and that brings with it a spirit that enables the fans to find an extra level or two, and should create the foundations for an atmosphere within the stadium that could well carry the players over the line to victory.\n\nEvery tackle, every header, every second ball — we must cheer it ferociously. The players have to do their part too and understand what a strong start early doors can do for how the rest of the game plays out from that point. When we win tackles or stick the ball into row Z for a throw-in, I want to see the Lads roaring towards the crowd and throwing up their arms — let’s make sure that Liverpool know that they’re in for a rough night.\n\nThen, who knows? We could be sat here on Thursday morning, proud as punch of yet another excellent Sunderland performance at the Stadium of Light, level on points with last season’s Champions and just one point away from our first huge target of the campaign.\n\nLet’s believe that we can achieve it. Let’s give them hell.",

Adam Wharton (22), Carlos Baleba (22) and Elliot Anderson (23) are all firm targets, as things stand.\n\nBrighton and Hove Albion’s Baleba was Ruben Amorim’s first choice before his reign came to an end, hence United holding tentative talks with the Cameroonian before 2025/2026 got underway.\n\n(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nNow, however, INEOS will also have to factor in the new manager’s opinion.\n\n“Manchester United have multiple midfielders on their list, and Sandro Tonali is one they’re monitoring,” said Romano on YouTube last night.\n\n“Final decisions depend on the permanent manager and UCL qualification. Amorim’s main target was Baleba.”\n\nAfter matchweek 25, United are well in the mix to secure their UCL spot, boasting a one-point advantage over Chelsea and a five-point lead over Liverpool due to their chaotic defeat to Manchester City on Sunday evening.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE OFFICIAL STRETTY NEWS APP FOR ALL THE LATEST UPDATES & BREAKING NEWS – STRAIGHT TO YOUR PHONE!

    "fullText": "Liverpool spent £450m last summer on new players as Arne Slot and Richard Hughes set about retaining the Premier League title.\n\nAmong the new arrivals were Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak - coming in on British-record deals. Also added was Hugo Ekitike up front - as the head coach and sporting director overhauled the frontline.\n\nSeveral players in attack had to make way to accommodate the new faces - including Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and Ben Gannon-Doak.\n\nThat helped the club towards a figure approaching £200m in sales - but there are signs that another clearout may be on the horizon.\n\nNew faces are coming next summer - with Jeremy Jacquet already secured and a winger set to be announced too. And in order to make space for those arrivals more current Liverpool stars are going to be leaving.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nWe could see the likes of Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah among the departures as Hughes and Slot plot improvements across the squad.\n\nThe Italian, 28, arrived on an initial £10m deal from Juventus back in September 2024. Despite winning the Premier League title the winger has endured a difficult spell on Merseyside - never looking like he was going to decisively win over Slot.\n\nJuventus were heavily linked with a move for their former player in January but that deal ran aground as the Reds were seeking a permanent move rather than a loan.\n\nNow the club’s demands have been set out in a new report from Caught Offside - which claims that Juventus, Napoli and Roma are set to contest the signature of the Italy international.\n\nLiverpool’s price range for a summer deal for Chiesa has now reached between £21 and £26m according to the report.\n\n“The Liverpool board is “open to letting him go”, with doubts about his ability to adapt to the Premier League pace, while Serie A sides are already moving in for Chiesa,” the report reads.\n\nThat is a mammoth sum for a fringe player - and it could represent a clear £16m profit on Chiesa. The Premier League champions are relatively well protected from a transfer fee perspective with the versatile forward contracted until 2028.\n\nBut Hughes needs to be careful that he doesn’t price the £150k per week forward out of a move completely. Chiesa has made just THREE Premier League starts under Slot since arriving at the club at the start of last season.\n\nIt is unlikely that his track record at Anfield is going to attract bids quite that high and so the LFC executive might need to come to a compromise.",

    "fullText": "Thomas Frank says he does not mind fans singing the names of former Spurs players and managers.\n\nThe Dane is under pressure at Tottenham having won just one of his last ten Premier League games and none of the last seven, with Spurs sitting 15th in the table.\n\nBut despite continued criticism from supporters and chants for managers and players of years gone by, Frank says he recognises the achievements of those who came before him.\n\n“I met Mauricio (Pochettino) a few times, a great guy, a great coach,” he said when asked about the fans singing the former Spurs boss’ name at games.\n\n“I think he’s a legend. I don’t think he won a trophy, but for me, he was part of transforming the club, where it was at that stage, to where it ended up being in terms of being close to winning the Premier League title, getting into the Champions League final.\n\n“If you’re close, then you’re very close to winning. Sometimes, you know, that’s football, there’s margins. I think Mauricio has done a top job here and he’s a true legend. If the fans sing their names, it’s well deserved.”\n\nSpurs take on Newcastle in their next Premier League clash as they look to improve their woeful run of form.\n\nBut Frank says he is confident his players are continuing to fight for him despite their results.\n\n“I haven’t seen one Premier League game that the players don’t want to run and fight,” he said.\n\n“So they need to continue it and keep doing what we believe is the right thing, and then it will turn. I’ve never experienced that it will not turn, so I experience it will turn again.\n\n“We can talk about the bottom of the table, or the top of the table, but it’s about the next game.\n\n“I’m fully, fully focused about that. Because there’s also one thing for sure, if you’re too afraid of achieving whatever you want to achieve, you can’t focus, so you just need to focus on your task and need to focus on the next game and do everything you can to win that.\n\n“It’s probably the most competitive Premier League in the five years I’ve been there. So it just makes it very, very difficult every game.”",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on golf superstar Ian Poulter plus the BBC readers and AI with his predictions for this week's midweek Premier League fixtures.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's mental strength was questioned when their previous Premier League title run-ins faltered under Mikel Arteta, but one of their most famous fans feels their mindset will not be an issue this season.\n\nGolf superstar Ian Poulter, renowned for his own rock-solid self-belief and dominant performances under pressure in the Ryder Cup, feels Arteta has that side of things under control.\n\n\"I definitely don't need to give them a pep talk about it,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Mikel has got that nicely covered and they are in the right place. He really backs them up 100%, even if they make mistakes.\n\n\"Some of them have got some scar tissue of not getting over the line in the past but, mentally, you would hope Mikel has got the players more together than ever just by saying 'look you know you are good enough and we now have a deep enough squad, so you have every reason to go into every game more confident than you were before'.\"\n\nYou can watch Poulter play for Majesticks GC, external at the LIV Golf event in Adelaide, Australia from 12-15 February on TNT Sports.\n\nHe is also taking on BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton - as well as the BBC readers and AI - by trying to predict the results of this week's midweek Premier League matches on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nBefore turning to golf, 50-year-old Poulter was a keen footballer and had trials with Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham aged 13.\n\n\"I am so glad that never worked out!\" he explained. \"I had two left feet, and it turned out everyone else Spurs have signed since has got two left feet as well.\n\n\"As soon as I turned 16, my focus was 100% on golf, and every waking minute of the day was about me being my own boss and telling myself that if I worked hard enough I would achieve big things.\n\n\"But I do miss football. I miss the kind of team camaraderie it gave me and I think that's why I've always loved the Ryder Cup as much as I've loved it.\n\n\"It's because that's where I can get the team aspect, the bonding and learning to how to win as a team, as well as the disappointments that come with that as well - I've always loved the dynamic of that extra pressure.\n\n\"Obviously going out to play golf for yourself is fine and you can take the hit if it doesn't work out, but having that the extra weight of playing for your peers and your captain is nice - if you can deal with it.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Ian Poulter were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nLeeds turned Chelsea over at Elland Road in December but they are not the same force away from home and this game smells of Chelsea revenge to me.\n\nThe Blues have made a good start under new boss Liam Rosenior, with four wins out of four in the league. Cole Palmer has hit form too, and they should win this fairly comfortably.\n\nIan's prediction: We annihilated Leeds a few days ago, and could have scored way more than the four we got. Chelsea look pretty solid at the moment too. 3-0\n\nEverton did well to fight back to beat Fulham late on at the weekend, but they could have been more than just a goal down at the break, while Bournemouth were unlucky only to draw with Aston Villa. They peppered Villa's goal with shots.\n\nI am going to go a bit leftfield here because although Everton beat Bournemouth earlier in the season, it was only thanks to a late deflected effort by Jack Grealish.\n\nI usually back Everton at home, and I'm usually wrong... so I am going to do something different this time. I am backing Bournemouth to pinch it.\n\nIan's prediction: It will be close but Everton to take it. 1-0\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 19:30\n\nTottenham captain Cristian Romero let his manager down with his red card against Manchester United, and now he is facing a four-game ban.\n\nIt's fine for Romero to be a motor mouth on social media, calling the club's recruitment \"disgraceful\", but he clearly needs to concentrate on his own game because he has been wild in the challenge again.\n\nFor a manager like Thomas Frank, who is under pressure, that is the last thing you need.\n\nPoor old Eddie Howe is feeling the heat at Newcastle too, though. We had callers in to 606 at the weekend saying it is time for a change - my reaction was 'what!?'.\n\nI really don't get that thinking at all, and not just because Howe's the guy who ended their long wait for a trophy, less than a year ago.\n\nHis squad is stretched now because of the Champions League and their run to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and he also had everything around Alexander Isak's exit to deal with at the start of the season, when it wasn't his doing.\n\nHowe just hasn't been able to replace Isak, either. Yoane Wissa has taken a while to get up and running and Nick Woltemade is very different to Isak in that he likes to come to the ball all the time.\n\nPeople are saying a change of voice might help, but what about backing the guy who has given you so much happiness? I don't understand why you'd want him out.\n\nThis is a very difficult game to predict for various reasons, but we do know Spurs are poor at home and Newcastle aren't great away.\n\nI still think someone will win it, but I am going to sit in the middle anyway, and go for a draw.\n\nIan's prediction: A point apiece. 1-1\n\nBoth of these teams have found a bit of form, and West Ham's victory over Burnley was huge for them in their fight against the drop.\n\nIt seems Manchester United can do no wrong under Michael Carrick, who has often been linked with the West Ham job down the years but goes back to his old club looking for a fifth straight win.\n\nI think he will get it, too. We had some callers into 606 thinking United would be Arsenal's biggest challengers from now on, which seems a stretch, but there is no doubt they are on a bit of a high.\n\nThis is the sort of game where idiots like me can get sucked in and get on the Carrick bandwagon... I am wary, but I am still going to be positive and jump on board too.\n\nIan's prediction: I don't like to say it but United have won their past four games and they have actually looked really good. They have got the bit between their teeth. 0-2\n\nBrighton have only won one of their past 12 league games so the worry for them has to be that they will get sucked into the relegation scrap.\n\nIt was a 4-3 home defeat by Aston Villa in December that was the start of this poor run for Fabian Hurzeler's side, and I don't see it ending at Villa Park.\n\nI'm surprised that the Seagulls are struggling. I looked at their bench against Crystal Palace at the weekend and thought 'blimey, they've got a good squad' but they are underperforming and the fans seem really split on Hurzeler, and have been for a while.\n\nVilla were lucky to get a point against Bournemouth at the weekend and I couldn't believe how Lucas Digne just let Rayan run past him for the Cherries equaliser. He seemed to give up and it was astonishingly bad defending.\n\nUnai Emery's side have lost their past two home league games, against Everton and Brentford, which worries me.\n\nWill it be a hat-trick of home defeats, or will they come good again? I've got to back my old team, so I am going with my heart here and saying Morgan Rogers will make the difference.\n\nIan's prediction: Villa might stumble again. 0-0\n\nCrystal Palace's win over Brighton was a huge result for them and the Eagles are definitely not short of firepower - if anything they have got too many centre-forwards now, but that's a good problem to have.\n\nBurnley have had it though - I thought that before they lost at home to West Ham on Saturday, but there can't be any doubt they are going down now.\n\nI don't think the Clarets will get anything here, either, but their fans seem to have turned on manager Scott Parker which I really don't like.\n\nThis is the guy who got them up but because the other promoted sides, Sunderland and Leeds, are having better seasons, that has gone against him.\n\nJust on the eyes, whenever I've watched them, Burnley have been competitive and have been in games.\n\nI just think there needs to be a bit of patience from their supporters, but of course they are entitled to their opinion.\n\nIan's prediction: Burnley really need a win but they won't get one. 1-0\n\nWas Sunday's late comeback to win at Anfield the game that will spark Manchester City's title bid?\n\nTime will tell, but I am not convinced. I still think the issues that saw City fall behind in the first place will still cost them in future games too.\n\nFair play to Pep Guardiola's side for turning things around with six minutes to go, because their record at Anfield was so poor and a point would not have been enough for them.\n\nBut I just don't see this City team controlling games any\n\nSunday was no different. They were getting mauled in the second half by wave after wave of Liverpool attacks, before the chaos at the end. Gianluigi Donnarumma's save was a big moment and I was delighted that Erling Haaland stuck his penalty away because he's captain of my fantasy team and that gave me a good score.\n\nAs a neutral, I hope the title race lasts until the final few weeks of the season but I just feel like City will drop too many more points before then.\n\nFulham are a good footballing side and almost got something from City at Craven Cottage in December - I was there, and City only just held on for a 5-4 win.\n\nMarco Silva's side have been hard done by in their past couple of games because they had plenty of chances in their defeat at Manchester United, then could have been well ahead at the break before they lost to Everton too.\n\nThis time? Well I think Fulham will score at Etihad Stadium too, and they are due a bit of a break. Maybe they will get it against City, but I am still going for a home win.\n\nIan's prediction: City will win this one. 2-0\n\nI was at Elland Road on Friday and Nottingham Forest were insipid in their defeat by Leeds - they were really flat.\n\nThis is a real pressure game for Forest, and in many ways it is the worst possible fixture for them. Wolves are hopeless so, if Forest win, their fans will say 'well we should be beating them, because they are rubbish'.\n\nLose or even drop points, however, then you can imagine the atmosphere and the mood of the fans, and the pressure that will put on the players.\n\nI don't mean pressure in terms of any calls to sack Forest boss Sean Dyche, but the negativity there will be around the team, when the mood of the fans can be massive when a team is fighting the drop.\n\nLeeds are a great example of that, actually. Just look at the positivity at Elland Road recently and how that has helped Leeds in the past few weeks. It was a very different story when the fans were unhappy earlier in the season.\n\nAs for Wolves, well they are not under any pressure any more.\n\nThey are playing for pride which is totally different to Forest's situation, where every point counts - and this is going to be a nervy night for the home fans at the City Ground.\n\nIan's prediction: Forest to edge it. 1-0\n\nThe Liverpool fans seem to have had enough of Arne Slot, which again makes no sense to me. Just because they aren't going to win the title again doesn't mean they aren't building anything.\n\nIt seems that making the Champions League places is like the title used to be now - as in, if you don't make the Champions League then the manager has got to go. It drives me potty.\n\nI know Sunderland lost at Arsenal on Saturday but I still enjoyed their performance.\n\nThat might sound odd because they were beaten 3-0 but I still thought the Black Cats were competitive, and they were really physical too. They matched Arsenal for long spells of the game.\n\nSo, Liverpool will know what to expect when they try to become the first team to win at Stadium of Light this season, and this is going to be a very difficult game for them.\n\nSlot needs a positive result here, for Liverpool to keep in touch with the teams above them in the race for the top four. My only concern about Sunderland is whether they can bring that same physicality again, but I still don't think Liverpool will win.\n\nIan's prediction: I just have a feeling Liverpool can sneak this one. 1-2\n\nCan Brentford produce another shock after beating Aston Villa and Newcastle in the past couple of weeks? No, they can't.\n\nKeith Andrews has done an incredible job as Bees boss and they will make life difficult for Arsenal because they are well organised and dangerous on the break.\n\nBut I still think Arsenal will win because of their sheer power that means they can run through anything.\n\nThis might not be the most entertaining game to watch, because Brentford will sit in and defend, and counter.\n\nArsenal will deal with that, and then find a way of scoring. A deflected goal will probably decide it.\n\nPeople might say the way they win games is not pretty but there is still a lot to admire about Arsenal and, in the end, no matter what anyone says, it is all about winning, isn't it?\n\nArsenal are very good at winning games, and I am expecting them to win this one too. In my opinion, they will go on and win the title too, because of the quality of their squad and how good they are defensively.\n\nAs much as you want beauty to triumph over a beast, City are still far too flaky for that to happen.\n\nIan on Arsenal's title hopes: I feel pretty confident, even with the couple of slip-ups we've had in the past month. We've got the strength in depth we need where other players can step up when we are missing players through injury.\n\nIf Viktor Gyokeres can start filling the onion bag up and Bukayo Saka can bag a few as well then that would be nice, but we look so good from set-pieces anyway. Our scoring stats from open play could be a bit of an issue but as long as we are scoring and winning then it doesn't really matter.\n\nIan's prediction: This is going to be a non-stressful win. We will be 2-0 up, concede a stupid goal but then finish the game off. 1-3\n\nChris and AI both got four correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week 25, giving them a total of 40 points apiece.\n\nHis guest, Gladiators star Apollo, was right about Manchester City's win at Anfield [everyone else went for a 2-2 draw] and ended up on 70 points thanks to four correct results including one exact score.\n\nBut the win went to the collective efforts of the BBC readers, with five correct results and one exact score [Bournemouth's 1-1 draw with Aston Villa] for a tally of 80 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s summer rebuild is already taking shape and, as reported by The Telegraph, Sandro Tonali has surged high on the club’s shortlist to replace Casemiro. It is a signal of intent from Old Trafford, a move that would blend long term planning with immediate competitive ambition.\n\nUnited’s need is obvious. Casemiro’s confirmed summer departure removes not only experience but also tactical security from the engine room. For a side still searching for rhythm, control, and authority in central areas, recruitment here will define the next phase of the project.\n\nTonali, 25, represents both pedigree and Premier League adaptation, a rare combination in a volatile market.\n\nUnited’s interest in Tonali sits within a broader scouting framework. Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are also under consideration, while previous inquiries into Brighton’s Carlos Baleba underline the club’s desire for athletic, progressive midfielders.\n\nYet Tonali’s profile stands apart.\n\nThree seasons in England have hardened his tactical awareness. Newcastle’s £55m investment in 2023 now looks modest in an era where Enzo Fernández, Moisés Caicedo and Declan Rice all commanded fees beyond £100m. Newcastle would expect similar territory for Tonali, particularly given his contract running to 2029.\n\nThere is risk attached, notably his betting ban earlier in his Premier League spell, but United appear focused on the footballer rather than the controversy.\n\nTransfer narratives rarely ignite without agent intervention and Giuseppe Riso’s remarks have ensured this story gathers pace.\n\n“Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,” Riso said.\n\nHe added, “We’ll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later. We’ll see how the season ends and then we’ll decide what to do.”\n\nPerhaps most telling was the ambiguity, “There’s no preference. It’s still early. What we’re saying today won’t apply tomorrow.”\n\nSuch language keeps every elite suitor engaged, Juventus, Manchester City, Arsenal, and now United most prominently.\n\nEuropean qualification may ultimately shape Tonali’s future. Newcastle sit 12th in the Premier League and face Qarabag in a Champions League play off, their route back to the competition remains uncertain.\n\nRiso acknowledged the emotional tie, stating, “Newcastle couldn’t let him go now, and there’s no point moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.”\n\nAttachment, though, often bends under competitive gravity. Tonali wants Champions League football. United believe they can offer it, or at least return to it swiftly.\n\nFrom a strategic lens, this pursuit feels calculated. Tonali is entering his peak years, already Premier League tested, tactically disciplined, and technically secure under pressure. He would not merely replace Casemiro, he would recalibrate United’s midfield identity.\n\nFrom a Manchester United supporter’s perspective, this report lands somewhere between excitement and caution.\n\nTonali is undeniably elite. His tempo control, positional intelligence, and ability to dictate transitions would address long standing midfield imbalances. United have too often lacked composure in high leverage matches, particularly against top six rivals. Tonali would change that dynamic.\n\nYet £100m territory demands scrutiny. Fans will remember recent midfield spending sprees across the league and question value versus urgency. Is Tonali transformative, or simply premium stabilisation.\n\nThere is also squad context. When Casemiro departs, United require not one midfielder but two, possibly three, depending on outgoings. Investing heavily in a single profile could restrict broader rebuild flexibility.\n\nStill, the upside is compelling. Tonali offers leadership without theatrics, control without slowing play, and durability in England’s most demanding fixtures.\n\nIf United are serious about restoring midfield authority, this is the calibre required. The question is not quality, it is whether the club can align finance, Champions League qualification, and long term squad architecture around one decisive signing.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): Huge save at 2-1 to keep Manchester City ahead in their win at Liverpool. This is why they bought him in - he's the guy to make big saves. He commanded his area really, really well. He wasn't able to keep a clean sheet but that was because arguably the goal of the season got put past him. He was fantastic.\n\nJayden Bogle (Leeds): Excellent going forward, he has played a number of positions this season for the team but I thought he was excellent in the 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest. He was a real outlet down that right side which is obviously huge for them and a massive three points for being safe and staying up.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City) and Axel Disasi (West Ham): Both of them have had an instant impact when they've come into the team. Disasi has to defend a bit deeper at West Ham - big, organised, putting his body on the line. He gives them a physical presence they've missed.\n\nMarc was a little lucky with the Mohamed Salah pullback - to still be on the pitch. But his leadership experience for Abdukodir Khusanov was exceptional. The level of confidence he gives this Manchester City backline is huge. Him hitting the ground running was exceptional for them.\n\nEl Hadji Malick Diouf (West Ham): Wonderful cross for the goal in the win at Burnley. He's been sensational since he came back from the Africa Cup of Nations. He's really added pace, power and a little bit of bite they have been missing down that side. He didn't have a great start to the season but we're starting to see the full potential of him now.\n\nVitaly Janelt (Brentford): He obviously gets a goal - wonderful header - but I actually thought he was just the best player on the pitch in the 3-2 win at Newcastle. I agree with Jordan Henderson in the sense he should have had the man of the match but he played well, kept it simple, broke up the game, broke forward when he needed to. A real solid midfielder's performance.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): What a difference a manager makes - being able to be free, get on the ball, go wherever he wants and be creative. I think Michael Carrick takes a lot of credit for that but again, another goal for him against Spurs, another win for United - he has to go in.\n\nRayan (Bournemouth): He was fantastic in the draw with Aston Villa. We have to look at Lucas Digne defensively but everything he did, running forward with pace, power, direct. He caused problems throughout the day. He's a big strong boy that gets his team up the pitch and he gets at the opposition - and Digne had no answers for him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): We're going to put him in the 10 even though he played right-back, but when you score a goal like that you're in. Unbelievable free-kick against Manchester City with pure technique to slice across the ball to make it swing from left to right and leave Donnarumma stranded.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): His first start back under Liam Rosenior, talking about getting his fitness back up. He loses a few points because he was against a very bad Wolves team. However fantastic, a hat-trick, goals, penalties, confidence. The most important thing is he's smiling again - that's great for Chelsea and great for England so he deserves that, as does Rosenior for giving him that.\n\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): I don't normally give subs the opportunity to start but Gyokeres to be fair came on at 60 minutes against Sunderland and scored two goals to get Arsenal over the line. Strong from him. Maybe having Jesus and Havertz around is going to bring out the best from him from a competitive point of view. But it's a fantastic day for him and a fantastic day for Arsenal.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): Huge, huge result for him at Anfield. His changes influence the game, and I think with Arsenal winning it's do or die and City put in a solid performance. Still wobbly, still a few question marks but they got the result which is all that matters.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "A generation of Manchester City supporters had not experienced a winning feeling at Anfield - but all that changed on a highly dramatic Sunday evening.\n\nTrailing 1-0 to Liverpool in the 84th minute, it was turning into a theme familiar for the Citizens faithful until captain Bernardo Silva and the ice-cool Erling Haaland both netted in the dying stages to hand Pep Guardiola's side a memorable victory.\n\nCity supporters were riotous when Rayan Cherki rolled in a third into an empty net from just inside his own half, but the goal was eventually ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR).\n\nIt mattered little as they stayed well after the final whistle to celebrate their side's triumph - only a third in the league since 1981.\n\nIt was also result that keeps City in the title race. Just.\n\nBoss Pep Guardiola joked afterwards about their last victory at Anfield five years ago, which came behind closed doors during Covid restrictions, saying: \"That doesn't count, right?\"\n\nBut this brilliant turnaround meant City are only six points adrift of leaders Arsenal with 13 games left to play - including a Gunners visit to Etihad Stadium in April - having been staring at a nine-point deficit in the closing stages.\n\n\"It is so difficult, Anfield is Anfield - the tradition, the history and the crowd,\" added Guardiola. \"It always looks smaller, tighter here and the pitch doesn't look like Etihad Stadium - and the players that they have, and everything.\n\n\"Of course we would be disappointed and all the questions would be over and over [about the title race] but six points is better than nine. It is still a lot considering how strong Arsenal are in all departments.\n\n\"The last 10 games, from my experience, it is so difficult. The important thing is to try to be there and improve because the second half was not good enough again.\n\n\"All we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal and being there, try if they go slip [up] and use it.\"\n\n'Killjoy' - did VAR get late drama in Liverpool v Man City right?\n\nPremier League: Man City fight back to beat Liverpool as Szoboszlai sent off in dramatic finish\n\nThe City substitutes piling over to their fans after Cherki's goal showed how much the victory meant to them - one supporter even got carried away and jumped on to the pitch before being led away by stewards.\n\nIt was an incredible conclusion to an engrossing encounter, one that has repeatedly delivered drama in Guardiola's past tussles with Jurgen Klopp and now Arne Slot.\n\nThese two sides have been the only teams to lift the Premier League trophy over the past eight years and, while reigning champions Liverpool have fallen away this term and sit in sixth place, City are clinging on.\n\n\"What can this do to Manchester City confidence-wise, going forward?\" said former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's all about putting runs together at this stage and that is a massive result that can give them a huge confidence boost.\n\n\"They might well just - and I mean just - be in this.\"\n\nAfter their 3-0 win at Etihad Stadium earlier in the season, City achieved a league double over Liverpool for the first time since the 1936-37 campaign.\n\n\"It's an important one for City today,\" former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney told BBC Sport. \"It's a tough place to go, Anfield.\n\n\"I thought Liverpool were really good in the second half, City were really good first half - then City have gone a goal down and dug in to get the three points.\"\n\nFormer United defender Gary Neville added: \"Will this give them the bit between the teeth? Will this give them the confidence to go and chase down Arsenal?\n\nCity captain Silva started the game after recovering from a recent hamstring issue and was the catalyst for his side's comeback by prodding in the equaliser from a Haaland knockdown.\n\nThe Portuguese has now played more game against Liverpool (16) than any other City player, while his three goals at Anfield makes him City's joint-top scorer at the stadium alongside Nicolas Anelka and Ilkay Gundogan.\n\nHaaland, by contrast, scored a first goal at Anfield with his winning penalty in the third minute of added time.\n\n\"I feel the whole team knew before the game if we lost it then the title race was probably over,\" said Silva. \"We felt like we needed to win.\n\n\"The hope is there and we are going to fight until the end. We need to keep doing our job that we haven't lately.\"\n\nOn Sunday, no player ran more than Silva's 12.84km, while no City player made more passes in the final third than his 24, nor did they attempt more dribbles than his four.\n\nEarlier this season, Guardiola said he has a \"weakness\" for the 31-year-old and a player he \"loves\" very much.\n\nSilva is out of contract in the summer and the City boss added: \"He is one of the best players I have every trained with.\n\n\"He is the perfect captain. It is a joy for me as a manager to have him. The team comes first.\n\n\"His contribution is massive and he is one of the legends of this club.\"",

    "fullText": "Liverpool’s preparations for a crucial Premier League showdown with Manchester City have been shaped by a blend of returning fitness, lingering absences and tactical adjustments. With Arne Slot seeking momentum in the second half of the campaign, the Reds’ predicted lineup and injury latest remain under close scrutiny.\n\nLiverpool have received a timely boost in defence, even as several key figures remain unavailable. The latest updates provide insight into how Slot is likely to shape his side for one of the defining fixtures of the season.\n\nJoe Gomez of Liverpool takes selfies with fans in the stands Liverpool v Crystal Palace, Premier League,\n\nLiverpool’s medical department has been busy in recent weeks, managing a congested fixture list and several long-term concerns. The most significant positive development is the return of Joe Gomez to first-team contention following a hip issue, offering Slot valuable depth across the back line.\n\nHowever, Jeremie Frimpong remains sidelined with a groin injury sustained earlier in the campaign, while Alexander Isak, Conor Bradley and Giovanni Leoni continue their respective recovery programmes. Their absence limits Liverpool’s options, particularly in wide defensive areas, where rotation has been restricted.\n\nThe Evening Standard reported that Gomez’s availability “has come at no better time” as Liverpool look to push towards the European places. This assessment reflects the broader picture: Slot is gradually regaining personnel, but the squad is still operating below full capacity.\n\nFitness management has become central to Liverpool’s approach this season. With high-intensity pressing still a feature of Slot’s philosophy, careful workload monitoring has influenced recent team selections and substitution patterns.\n\nLiverpool’s defensive structure is expected to remain largely consistent for the Manchester City fixture. Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are set to continue their partnership at centre-back, providing physical presence and leadership against one of the league’s most dynamic attacks.\n\nAt right-back, Dominik Szoboszlai is likely to deputise once again in the absence of Frimpong. The Hungarian’s adaptation to the role has been one of the quieter success stories of recent weeks, combining energy with tactical discipline.\n\nOn the left side, Milos Kerkez is favoured to start, although Andy Robertson remains an alternative depending on match demands. Slot has rotated between the two in recent fixtures, balancing experience with athleticism.\n\nThis defensive unit reflects Liverpool’s current priorities: stability, positional awareness and controlled build-up. Against a City side known for exploiting half-spaces, maintaining compactness between full-backs and centre-backs will be essential.\n\nIn midfield, Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch are expected to retain their places as the double pivot. Their complementary profiles have brought greater balance, with Mac Allister dictating tempo and Gravenberch offering ball-carrying power.\n\nCurtis Jones remains in contention after a run of regular minutes, but current indications suggest continuity will be preferred for such a high-stakes encounter. Slot has consistently stressed the importance of rhythm and cohesion in central areas.\n\nAhead of them, Mohamed Salah, Florian Wirtz and Cody Gakpo are likely to operate in advanced roles, supporting Hugo Ekitike as the central striker. Ekitike’s recent brace against Newcastle reinforced his growing importance, particularly in matches requiring physical presence and pressing intensity.\n\nThis attacking configuration is designed to combine directness with creativity. Wirtz’s ability to operate between the lines, Salah’s wide threat and Gakpo’s movement offer multiple routes to goal, while Ekitike provides a focal point.\n\nBased on current fitness reports and recent selections, Liverpool’s predicted lineup is expected to be:\n\nAlisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike.\n\nThis XI reflects both necessity and intent. Injuries have narrowed the pool, but Slot has settled on a core group capable of executing his tactical framework under pressure.\n\nThe original Evening Standard analysis highlights how Liverpool’s recent win over Newcastle has boosted confidence ahead of this fixture. That result, combined with incremental improvements in squad availability, has created cautious optimism within the camp.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, this lineup prioritises pressing coordination, transitional speed and defensive resilience. Against Manchester City, margins are fine, and Liverpool’s ability to manage possession without losing intensity will be decisive.\n\nWith the race for European qualification tightening, every point carries increased significance. This match represents not only a test of Liverpool’s current form, but also an indicator of how far Slot’s project has progressed.\n\nIf key players remain fit and the defensive unit continues to stabilise, Liverpool’s predicted lineup could provide the foundation for a strong finish to the campaign.",

    "description": "Supra du Quebec kick off their inaugural Canadian Premier League in April and will field only players born or raised in the province.",
    "fullText": "Rocco Placentino stood in front of Supra du Quebec's players, coaches and club management ready to deliver a speech before the club's first ever training session.\n\nAs the club's co-founder and president tried to find the words, he became emotional looking at what had been created and what was staring back at him.\n\nFormer Canada international Placentino saw a group of players and coaches all born or raised in Quebec, Canada.\n\nThey had been brought together, inspired by Bilbao's Athletic Club, to help put the only French-speaking province in Canada on the footballing landscape.\n\n\"It's done with local pride, local players, local staff, local upper management and local partnerships,\" said Placentino of Supra, who continue their pre-season preparation on Sunday before competing in the Canadian Premier League.\n\n\"Although it's not only talking about it but putting it into action, which we are doing. It's real, it's not a myth, it's not a fiction. It's truth, it's happening and we're extremely proud about this.\"\n\nPlacentino was raised in Montreal and played for Quebec's other professional football team, Major League Soccer side CF Montreal, as well as having spells in Italy's second and third divisions.\n\nWhile Montreal throw their scouting net across the world to be competitive, FC Supra are focusing on local players who may have overlooked.\n\nThey want to give other players from Quebec the chance to try and emulate Canadian internationals such as Saussolo's Ismael Kone and Nice's Moise Bombito.\n\nBombito was born in Montreal, while Kone moved to the city from the Ivory Coast aged seven, and their journeys highlight the rich cultural mix and football obsession found in Quebec.\n\n\"The objective is to have a local pride program in the Canadian Premier League, a team that could furnish players that are local and multicultural,\" said Placentino.\n\n\"I look at countries like Belgium and Iceland. If they're able to build players and sell them worldwide to become phenom footballers, why can't we do it in Quebec?\n\n\"A lot of players would fall through the cracks here and miss out on opportunities to shine and to be exposed at a higher level.\n\n\"All we need to do is take these ballers, put them in an environment that is very professional but also keeping that DNA of being street ballers.\"\n\nA unique touch showcasing Supra's pride in their province is having the Quebec flag printed on their kits.\n\nPaul Desbaillets, Supra's chief branding officer, says the aim was to bring Quebec's unique character to life.\n\n\"There's always been a history of Quebec versus Canada,\" he said.\n\n\"What makes us so proud exactly at this club is that here is more proof of why this province is so spectacular. We are a complete mix of French, Italian, British, Moroccan, Persian and Asian.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what ethnicity. We've formed together around Supra first and that's our melting pot of what Quebec is.\"\n\nSupra du Quebec may be a new club, that are yet to play a competitive game, but the idea of the club colours and name all stemmed from one of Montreal's first football teams.\n\nSupra Montreal only operated between 1988 and 1992, but provided the environment for a six-year-old Placentino to form some of his earliest footballing memories.\n\n\"I remember going to games with my father and watching players that were mainly local players playing for Supra Montreal,\" he said.\n\n\"I loved the colours. I loved the blue, white, and red.\n\n\"And I said, 'You know what? I want to relive that experience as now a founder of this club and bring back that local pride and that Quebec feeling'. We wanted to relive it and modernise it the best way we could.\"\n\nAlong with the colours and name, there is a more personal link between the two clubs through one of their new players, Alessandro Biello.\n\nWhat makes the 19-year-old's signing so special is that his dad, Mauro, played for the original Supra and captained Placentino while they played together at CF Montreal.\n\n\"When we signed [Alessandro] Biello every box was checked in terms of what we were looking for,\" said Placentino.\n\n\"The work ethic, bleeding for the colours, bleeding for the city, playing in front of his family and friends, having that drive to do well with the Supra, so that maybe one day he could be sold to a team in Europe.\n\n\"So for us it's a very proud moment to have Mauro's son play for Supra and hopefully he follows in his father's footsteps.\"\n\nQuebec is home to roughly nine million people. To represent FC Supra a player or coach has to have been born, raised or have a deep connection to the state.\n\nThis transfer policy is similar to Athletic Club's Basque-only approach, with Placentino hoping to visit the Spanish side to understand how growing a club using this transfer policy is possible.\n\nThe Supra president has already discovered some positives and negatives to running a policy like this, with the former Canada international having to reject more than 150 offers from players who had no connection to Quebec.\n\nBut despite a focus on growing local talent, there has also been interest from athletes who have moved away from Quebec to all corners of the globe but are keen to get involved with Supra.\n\n\"There are players who play in Guatemala, in Finland, in Iceland, in Sweden, in Malta that are all Quebec-based players and are saying, 'I want to come home',\" explained Placentino.\n\n\"They can't wait to come home and when you hear that, I get goosebumps.\"\n\nThis feelings of the players, coaches and management are shared by Placentino, which is why the club's motto is so poignant.\n\n\"Un club d'ici, pour ici.\" It translates to \"A club from here, for here.\"",

    "fullText": "Liverpool host Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday while aiming to secure a second consecutive Premier League victory.\n\nThe Reds have moved into second place following their emphatic 4–1 win over Newcastle United. Manager Arne Slot oversaw a return to form for his attacking unit. Hugo Ekitiké was instrumental in that win. He currently averages a goal contribution every 112 minutes. Liverpool boast an incredible home record against City, losing just once in their last 22 meetings at Anfield. A win today would significantly close the gap on league leaders Arsenal.\n\nArne Slot manages a squad coping with several notable absences in the defensive and attacking lines. Notably, Jeremie Frimpong is ruled out with a thigh injury. Alexander Isak also remains on the treatment table. Consequently, Dominik Szoboszlai could start at right-back to provide defensive cover. Florian Wirtz enters the match in scintillating form, boasting nine goal involvements in his last 11 games.\n\nAlisson Becker will start in goal behind a defensive pairing of Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk. Miloš Kerkez is expected to keep his place at left-back. In midfield, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister will anchor the side. Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo will support Ekitiké from wide areas. Liverpool have earned 28 points from losing positions since the start of last season. Their resilience will be vital against the champions.\n\nLiverpool predicted XI: Alisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Anfield on Sunday, 8 February 2026.

    "fullText": "Anfield plays host to the definitive “main event” of Premier League gameweek 25 this Sunday as Liverpool and Manchester City renew a rivalry that has defined the modern era of English football.\n\nFor Pep Guardiola’s side, the trip to Merseyside is a high-stakes mission to stay within touching distance of league leaders Arsenal. The Citizens could find themselves nine points adrift by kick-off. Consequently, a victory at a ground where they historically struggle is almost non-negotiable. Liverpool appear to be emerging from a difficult winter slump. Arne Slot’s men rediscovered their “killer instinct” with a dominant 4–1 dismantling of Newcastle United last weekend. Sunday’s clash promises a high-octane tactical battle where neither side can afford to blink.\n\nLast Meeting: Manchester City 3–0 Liverpool (9 Nov 2025), Premier League\n\nArne Slot confirmed that Joe Gomez (hip) has a slight chance of making the matchday squad. However, the Reds will be without Jeremie Frimpong (thigh), who was ruled out earlier this week. Liverpool’s injury list also includes Conor Bradley, Alexander Isak, and Giovanni Leoni. On a positive note, Florian Wirtz enters the game in scintillating form. He boasts nine goal involvements in his last 11 appearances.\n\nPep Guardiola remains uncertain regarding the availability of captain Bernardo Silva. In better news, Rúben Dias returned to the bench midweek following a month-long layoff. John Stones has also resumed first-team training. Marc Guéhi is available after being ineligible for the EFL Cup. Erling Haaland is expected to return to the starting lineup after being rested as a substitute against Newcastle.\n\nThe Reds have made Anfield a fortress against today’s visitors. Notably, Liverpool have lost just one of their last 22 Premier League home games against Manchester City. They recently rediscovered their scoring touch in the dominant win over Newcastle. Hugo Ekitiké is proving to be a revelation this term. He averages a goal or assist every 112 minutes, the best debut-season ratio for a Liverpool player since Mohamed Salah.\n\nCity arrive with a strange statistical anomaly in 2026. Notably, they have not conceded a single first-half goal this year. However, they are also the only side yet to score a second-half goal, conceding six in that period. Rayan Cherki remains their primary creative hub, creating three chances per 90 minutes. Notably, Anfield remains one of only two grounds where Erling Haaland has played but never scored.\n\nLiverpool Predicted XI: Alisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike\n\nManchester City Predicted XI: Donnarumma; Nunes, Guehi, Ake, Ait-Nouri; Rodri, O’Reilly; Cherki, Reijnders, Semenyo; Haaland\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League, and Sky Ultra HD. Coverage starts at 16:00 GMT. Fans can also stream the action via the Sky Go app.\n\nRead more- Thomas Frank ‘proud’ of 10-man Spurs following Man Utd defeat\n\nSee Also- Bruno Fernandes sends Man Utd message as winning run continues\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace travel to the South Coast on Sunday, aiming to end a dismal nine-match winless run in the Premier League.\n\nThe Eagles have moved into a precarious position, sitting 15th and on the brink of the relegation zone. Manager Oliver Glasner oversees a side that has struggled for goals recently. Palace have underperformed their Expected Goals (xG) by over eight goals since mid-December. However, they remain resilient in derbies, having drawn seven of their last 13 meetings with Brighton. A result today is vital to ease mounting pressure on the squad.\n\nOliver Glasner manages a squad bolstered by the return of its primary midfield anchor. Notably, Adam Wharton is available to start after serving a one-match suspension. However, Eddie Nketiah is set to miss out through injury. Consequently, the manager is expected to rely on Ismaïla Sarr to provide the goals. Sarr has nine goals this season and scored twice on his last visit to the Amex.\n\nDean Henderson will start in goal behind a defensive back three featuring Maxence Lacroix. Daniel Muñoz and Tyrick Mitchell will provide the width from wing-back positions. In midfield, Wharton will partner Will Hughes to provide defensive stability. Yeremy Pino and Brennan Johnson will support Sarr in a flexible front three. Palace must find a clinical edge to avoid becoming the league’s lowest scorers since Matchday 16.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Richards, Lacroix, Riad; Munoz, Hughes, Wharton, Mitchell; I. Sarr, Pino, Johnson\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the American Express Stadium on Sunday, 8 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 14:00 GMT.\n\nUK fans can watch the match live on Sky Sports Main Event. Coverage begins one hour before kick-off on television and the Sky Go app.\n\nRead more- Thomas Frank ‘proud’ of 10-man Spurs following Man Utd defeat\n\nSee Also- Bruno Fernandes sends Man Utd message as winning run continues\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Chelsea striker Liam Delap is reportedly now playing for his future at the club in the second half of this Premier League season.\n\nDelap has been struggling at the club since he arrived from Ipswich Town in the summer transfer window. As well as with his form on the pitch, he has struggled with injuries off it too.\n\nI think Delap is a decent striker, but I’m starting to wonder whether he might just suit a team that plays on transition rather than possession based. He seems to be really struggling with Chelsea’s style of play. But maybe he can grow into it and get used to it a bit more? Well, apparently he has half a season to prove he can, otherwise Chelsea are looking to sell him…\n\nLiam Delap with Liam Rosenior in training. (Photo by Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC)\n\nLiam Delap’s former suitors are keeping a very close eye on developments at Stamford Bridge, with TEAMtalk reporting that the striker is effectively playing for his Chelsea future in the second half of the campaign.\n\nManchester United, Newcastle United and Everton all pushed hard for his signature before his move to Stamford Bridge, and all three clubs are apparently monitoring the situation closely should Chelsea decide to listen to offers. The report goes on to say that other clubs such as Brighton and Sunderland are also watching.\n\nChelsea beat Wolves 3-1 yesterday afternoon in their latest Premier League game, effectively winning the game in the first half by scoring all three of their goals to put it out of reach for the home side.\n\nCole Palmer was the hat-trick hero of the day, getting all three of Chelsea’s goals in the first half to announce himself fully back and ready for the rest of the campaign.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City take on Liverpool at Anfield today in what is a massive Premier League fixture. When City play Liverpool, it is one of the biggest Premier League fixtures of the season. Today’s match is no exceptionn, especially for Pep Guardiola’s side. City enter today’s match nine points behind Arsenal, who sit clear at the top of the Premier League. Manchester City have to beat Liverpool today at a ground where they typically don’t play well to keep in touch with Mikel Arteta’s side.\n\nHere is the latest Manchester City injury and team news, and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of today’s match.\n\nOn the injury front, Josko Gvardiol, Savinho, Mateo Kovacic and Jeremy Doku will all miss today’s match. The quartet have all been ruled out of the crucial Premier League fixture at Anfield. Bernardo Silva is also in doubt for today’s match. The City captain missed Manchester City’s win over Newcastle due to a hamstring injury. Pep Guardiola confirmed on Friday that Bernardo Silva is in doubt for today’s match.\n\nIn good news for City, Ruben Dias has trained all week and is available to play against Liverpool. It remains to be seen if he will start at Anfield. With Bernardo Silva in doubt for today’s match, Pep Guardiola may prefer to start Dias given the leadership that the Portuguese international provides. John Stones has finally returned to training after a lengthy injury layoff, but today’s match has likely come too soon for Stones to play any part.\n\nMarc Guehi is available to play today. Guehi was ineligible for Manchester City’s Carabao Cup semi-final second-leg tie against Newcastle.",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how things are shaping up as the fight for Premier League survival hots up.",
    "fullText": "For the first time since before Christmas, just three points will separate the teams in 17th and 18th at the end of a Premier League weekend.\n\nWest Ham's 2-0 victory at Burnley has at last dragged them to within touching distance of Nottingham Forest again, with the Hammers enjoying a mid-season renaissance by winning three of their past four matches.\n\nWhile Wolves and Burnley are cut completely adrift, Nuno Espirito Santo's team are seemingly keeping the relegation battle alive single-handedly.\n\nThere have only been 10 occasions since the Premier League was formed in 1992-93 that the fight for survival has not gone down to the final day - although five of those have occurred in the last decade.\n\nSo after some damp squibs in recent years, are we set for an unusually exciting end to the campaign at the bottom of the table?\n\nBBC Sport looks at how things are shaping up as clubs attempt to avoid the dreaded drop into the Championship.\n\nWhile Wolves are not mathematically down yet, they are propping up the table on a meagre eight points from 25 matches and sports analytics and data experts Opta rank their chances of relegation as 99.99%.\n\nThat also effectively means the West Midlands club are in a scrap to avoid the unwanted record of winning the fewest points in a single Premier League campaign, currently held by Derby, who managed just 11 in 2007-08.\n\nMeanwhile, Burnley's loss to the Hammers means there is a 99.4% chance they will spend next term in the second tier of English football.\n\nThere was an air of frustration around Turf Moor on Saturday with the home fans castigating the players and calling for Scott Parker's dismissal as boss after watching their team fail to win for a 16th consecutive match.\n\n\"Whether we fail or we don't fail, we come through this for sure,\" said Parker.\n\n\"I'm really sorry that I can't promise we'll be better for it with a win or with staying in this division but the longer the journey is, we will be better for it.\"\n\nHammers boss Nuno said his side \"are still in the same situation\" and called on them to \"focus on\" themselves after winning in Lancashire.\n\nHaving gone 10 Premier League matches without a win, West Ham appear to have built some momentum from Callum Wilson's dramatic late goal at Tottenham on 17 January.\n\nAnd they will feel they can tackle their remaining 13 games with renewed optimism despite being ranked with a 75.77% chance of going down, with Nuno also having the experience of guiding Nottingham Forest to safety on the final day of the 2023-24 campaign.\n\n\"West Ham look more like a Nuno team over the last few weeks,\" said former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy, who is a pundit on Saturday's Match of the Day.\n\n\"They have won three out of four and have all the momentum. Crysencio Summerville is playing out of his skin and Jarrod Bowen is always going to chip in, plus they've signed two strikers.\n\n\"All of a sudden they look like a team that can score goals and that means you don't have to rely so heavily on keeping them out the other end.\n\n\"However, you'd always rather have the points in the bag than doing the chasing as you can't have many slip-ups - you have to keep on getting points.\"\n\nWhile Forest are just three points above West Ham in 17th, Sean Dyche will hope his side has the quality to pull clear having spent around £200m on players over the last 12 months.\n\nOpta rank the two-time champions of Europe as having a 15.3% chance of being relegated and it is likely Dyche will have to juggle his resources due to the club's continued involvement in the Europa League, where they are due to face Fenerbahce in the knockout play-offs for the last 16.\n\n\"Too many times recently, I've seen Nottingham Forest look passive,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Whether that's legginess from the amount of games in which Sean Dyche has had to play the same players. He gave fringe players the chance to stake their claim against Wrexham and they didn't take it, so he's had to pick the same eight or nine week in week out.\n\n\"I've done it myself and it's hard trying to play every few days and playing to your best, especially under pressure of relegation. Plus, they are trying to manage Europe as well.\"\n\nLeeds, who claimed a valuable win over Forest on Friday, appear to be in the best form of the three sides on 29 points.\n\nCrystal Palace, who travel to Brighton on Sunday, appear to be in disarray after the departure of captain Marc Guehi and manager Oliver Glasner's confirmation he will be leaving the club at the end of the season.\n\nTottenham have also taken just four of the past 21 points available and have not won a top-flight game since the start of the year.\n\n\"Palace have got a scrap on their hands as confidence is draining,\" added Murphy.\n\n\"I'm like the majority and think Tottenham will be OK even though the results don't say it. Their squad and the quality they've got will come good and they will get enough points.\n\n\"Leeds, for me, are the ones who will be safe given the way they have played in the last two or three months. They have some really nice momentum. And we all know about the Elland Road factor, which is huge.\n\n\"So, I think it's between Forest, Palace and West Ham. It is going to be so tight. I really think its going to go down to the wire.\"\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "fullText": "Wolves manager Rob Edwards, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We started the game well. I think we made a couple of ludicrous decisions in the penalties. And you can't give a team like that with the quality that they've got that sort of headstart.\n\n\"After that, with the feel around the place, it affected one or two. It wasn't a good environment to play in, up until half time. It was important to get in and fix one or two things. Which we did. The challenge then was for the players to show some character, some belief and understand that what we'll try and do now is win the second half - which we did.\"\n\n\"We'll learn a lot. We're going through a process, we've got to make some changes. We've done that in the window with people leaving, the lads coming in were excellent, Adam [Armstrong] and Angel [Gomes] were really good. Real positives for us.\n\n\"It's going to take some time to get it to where we want to be. But there were a lot of signs in the second half against a quality team that everyone is there, and willing to fight and keep doing it.\"\n\nOn new signings Armstrong and Gomes: \"I thought they were brave, worked incredibly hard, showed lots and lots of quality. Angel got on the ball and looked to try and make things happen, was really busy and bright.\n\n\"Adam was incredibly hard working, linked it really well, looked aggressive at the right times. Very very pleased - I thought they were both a big plus for us.\"\n\nWolves have gained just eight points in the Premier League this season (W1 D5 L19), the fewest points tally after 25 games in the competition's history and Wolves' worst ever league season after 25 matches.\n\nThe Old Gold scored their first second half goal in 11 Premier League home matches. It had been 469 second half minutes since their last goal at Molineux in August 2025 against Everton.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United will be looking to make it four wins out of four under interim boss Michael Carrick when they welcome Tottenham Hotspur to Old Trafford for an intriguing Premier League clash on Saturday lunchtime.\n\nThe two teams butt heads for the first time since August when Matthijs de Ligt scored a 96th-minute equaliser for the Red Devils in a 2-2 draw in North London.\n\nIt is fair to say that Man United have turned a corner since the departure of Ruben Amorim and arrival of Carrick, with the Red Devils picking up nine points from a possible nine available under their new boss and extending their unbeaten Premier League run to seven matches (W4 D3).\n\nUnited are unbeaten in all nine of their Premier League matches this season when they have had less possession than their opponents (W7 D2), prevailing in all seven when having less than 45%. In contrast, they have won only four of their 15 top-flight games when in control of +50% of the ball (D6 L5).\n\nA win for the Red Devils against Tottenham would also see them claim four consecutive victories for the first time since February 2024 under Erik ten Hag. However, success against Spurs has been hard to come by in recent years, with United failing to win any of their last six league encounters with the North Londoners (D3 L3) – their joint-longest run without a win against them (also six between 1914 and 1921).\n\nUnited duo Patrick Dorgu and De Ligt remain sidelined with respective thigh and back injuries, while this weekend’s game will come too soon for Mason Mount who recently picked up a knock in training.\n\nCarrick is expected to stick with his winning formula and not make wholesale changes to his starting lineup, but he may be tempted to recall Sesko in attack after his impact as a substitute last time out. That would result in one of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo or Matheus Cunha making way, though.\n\nCaptain Bruno Fernandes has registered more assists than any other Premier League player so this season, with his 12 also his joint-best tally in a single campaign (level with 2020-21). The playmaker is expected to continue in an advanced central role behind the central striker.\n\nIt’s a half past noon kickoff in the UK, which means a 7:30 a.m. kickoff on the East Coast of the U.S.\n\nThe match is on Sky Sports Premier League in the UK. Those Stateside can watch on USA or NBC Streaming streaming. In Canada, it’s on DAZN and Fubo.\n\nEveryone else, head on over to LiveSoccerTV to find your viewing options.\n\nManchester United possible starting lineup: Lammens; Dalot, Maguire, Martinez, Shaw; Mainoo, Casemiro; Diallo, Fernandes, Mbeumo; Cunha",

    "description": "After Leeds' win over Nottingham Forest on Friday, BBC Sport looks at what it all means for the Premier League relegation battle.",
    "fullText": "One down, three to go for Leeds.\n\nBefore their crucial win against Nottingham Forest, boss Daniel Farke said he expected four more victories would seal his side's Premier League survival.\n\nFriday's dominant 3-1 triumph, thanks to goals from Jayden Bogle, Noah Okafor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, moved them nine points clear of the relegation zone and chalked one off.\n\nThey now sit on 29 points - already enough to survive in both of the past two seasons.\n\n\"It was a game with a bit more on the line,\" said Farke afterwards. \"It feels sometimes a bit more important than other games.\n\n\"To deliver in this way with such a spirited performance, it's sometimes more perfect than an easy 4-0 or 5-0. It was a massive performance.\"\n\nTheir advantage over the bottom three may be cut back to six points if West Ham win at Burnley in another huge game on Saturday, but little would dampen the mood at a sodden Elland Road.\n\nSo what does this result really mean for Leeds, Forest and the wider relegation picture?\n\nOnly three times have teams been relegated at the end of a 38-game Premier League season having been on at least 29 points at this stage.\n\nSunderland, who were on 29 points after 25 games finished 18th in 1996-97, while Ipswich and Birmingham City, who were on 30 in 2001-02 and 2010-11 respectively, also ended the season in 18th.\n\nOn average, the team finishing in 17th ends up on 38 points - and, just as Farke suggested pre-match, three more wins from their 13 remaining games would see Leeds get there.\n\nThings don't look too bad for Nottingham Forest either, though.\n\nOnly three teams have gone down at the end of a 38-game season after being on 26 points at this stage.\n\nOf the past nine teams who have been relegated, Leicester's 24 points in 2022-23 is the most any team who finished inside the bottom three had after 25 games.\n\nFollowing Friday's match, Opta predicts that Leeds have only a 4.75% chance of going down, with Forest on 10.24%.\n\nWest Ham are 83.88% likely to go down - although that could yet change after Saturday's game - while Burnley (98.35%) and Wolves (99.99%) appear to be all but down already.\n\nFarke seemed on the brink of losing his job earlier this season, but has overseen a stunning turnaround in his side's form.\n\nIt began when he opted to tear up the gameplan at Manchester City in November, reverting to a 3-5-2 formation with two up top and only being condemned to defeat after City scored a stoppage-time winner.\n\nThat result left them sitting inside the bottom three on goal difference, but their fortunes have markedly changed in the matches that have followed.\n\nLeeds have lost just two of their past 12 games and picked up 18 points.\n\n\"They've been on a great run since that Manchester City game way before Christmas,\" ex-Leeds midfielder Stuart Dallas said on Sky Sports.\n\n\"They had the change of shape, the change of formation and they've put a really good run together.\n\n\"They were excellent throughout the game [against Nottingham Forest] and it's a big win. Psychologically it is huge for them ahead of a weekend of big fixtures.\"\n\nForest, meanwhile, have won just two of their past nine Premier League games.\n\nCrucially, one of those was a 2-1 victory at West Ham last month, which kept the Hammers from moving one point behind.\n\nAnd, even when Nuno Espirito Santo's side beat Sunderland two weeks ago, Forest reacted with an impressive 2-0 win at Brentford 24 hours later.\n\nThose results were achieved, however, with a first-choice defence - and the absence of Matz Sels with a groin injury has been a huge loss too.\n\nIt was a gamble to replace last season's joint Golden Glove winner with John Victor in December and one which ultimately backfired, with Victor himself now also sidelined for the rest of the campaign.\n\nThat prompted Forest to bring in Stefan Ortega from Manchester City during the transfer window - but his debut against Leeds meant a defence which was so consistent last season was only changed further.\n\nZach Abbott was another debutant at Elland Road, the 19-year-old making his first Premier League appearance in the absence of injured defender Murillo.\n\nAbbott was targeted in the first half as Leeds seized on his inexperience - although Leeds' goals were ultimately down to a collective failure.\n\n\"We didn't get the injury news on Murillo until after training so we didn't get to work on anything else after that,\" said boss Sean Dyche.\n\n\"We just can't make basic errors like that. We didn't have a lot of time to work with the group at the back but we can't make basic errors.\n\n\"When we got here we were two points in the relegation zone and now we're six points out of it. I wasn't getting carried away beating Liverpool 3-0 and Tottenham 3-0 and people saying it was one of the best performances they've had in the Premier League.\n\n\"I knew if we won the work wasn't done. I look at if the work is done at the end of the season, not if we win or lose a game.\"\n\nThe full ramifications of yet another disappointing night for Nottingham Forest won't be known until Sunday evening.\n\nThe loss at Leeds will serve only to heighten concerns at the City Ground over the looming threat of relegation.\n\nWest Ham will cut Forest's cushion to three points with victory over Burnley on Saturday, while Crystal Palace and Tottenham can stretch their advantages over Dyche's side to six points by the time the weekend is out.\n\nYou wonder how the Forest hierarchy may react if the walls close in any more. Indeed, it is understood Dyche is under increasing pressure.\n\nLosing to a fellow relegation candidate in such a meek manner at Elland Road will not ease the internal scrutiny on Dyche's performance, with sources indicating support for the head coach isn't currently as solid as it has been.\n\nHaving already had three managers this season, it seems inconceivable that owner Evangelos Marinakis will seek a fourth head coach before the campaign is out.\n\nBut history tells us that the club's Greek owner has not been slow in making such decisions if he believes it is in Forest's best interests.\n\nThey now face bottom club Wolves on Wednesday at the City Ground. The home support will be expecting three points - but if Forest falter the pressure on Dyche will intensify.\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "fullText": "It is 10 years since Leicester City became the Premier League's most remarkable champions.\n\nThe Foxes, though, are in danger of marking the anniversary in the most inauspicious of ways with relegation.\n\nIt was on 2 May, 2016 that Leicester were mathematically confirmed as top-flight champions for the first time in their 142-year history.\n\nOn 2 May, 2026 they face Blackburn with their Championship status now in doubt after they were docked six points for breaching profit and sustainability (P&S) rules.\n\nThe punishment dragged them down to the edge of the relegation zone - kept out on goal difference alone.\n\nIt is a remarkable slide from glory which can be charted alongside battles against spending regulations.\n\nWith only one point from their last four games, supporters are starting to fear things could get worse at the King Power Stadium before they get better.\n\nRather than celebrate the title success a decade ago that defied belief, Leicester could be facing up to life in the third tier for the first time since the 2008-09 campaign.\n\nHow did the club end up here, and what could come next?\n\nFoxes should 'take medicine' and move on - Fryatt\n\nReaction to Foxes' points deduction on BBC Radio Leicester's When You're Smiling podcast\n\nThe Premier League triumph was just the start of a glory period for Leicester.\n\nThey also won the FA Cup for the only time in their history in 2021.\n\nThere was a season in the Champions League and two Europa League campaigns. In 2021-22 they lost to Roma in the semi-finals of the Conference League.\n\nBack-to-back eighth-placed finishes had the club's board believing, and spending like, this was now their natural place.\n\nJust 12 months after that defeat by Roma, Leicester were relegated.\n\n\"We tried to play with the big boys and we couldn't,\" Lynn Wyeth, chair of the Foxes' Trust, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It didn't fit our model. It didn't fit a club of our size. It didn't fit our budget.\n\n\"And then we've just had an absolute spiral downwards.\"\n\n'Lucky escape' or 'nonsensical' points deduction?\n\nLeicester spent just over £100m to sign six players across the 2021-22 and 2022-23 campaigns.\n\nIt was not just the transfer fees which were to cause issues, it was the salaries and the contracts.\n\nThe club's wage bill ballooned to £206m.\n\n\"Everybody assumed that they would be a top-eight club,\" Football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\n\"They effectively budgeted for that and didn't take into consideration the potential downside.\"\n\nMaguire said Leicester became \"a little bit complacent\" with contracts.\n\nPremier League player contracts would usually have clauses which would reduce a salary by between 30% or 50% upon relegation.\n\nIt is widely reported that, at the time, Leicester did not insert any.\n\n\"They had one bad season and they had no comeback in terms of relegation clauses and relegation avoidance clauses,\" added Maguire.\n\n\"It does seem that these contracts were awarded in such a way that they ignored the existential risk of relegation.\"\n\nIn the 2022-23 relegation season the club were spending 116% of their income on salaries.\n\nIt was then 102% in the 2023-24 season, and Maguire said the £107m wage bill was \"unprecedented for a second-tier football club\".\n\nLeicester may have won the Championship title in 2024, but it came at a cost. A huge cost.\n\nThe wage bill of the two other relegated teams was £84m for Leeds and £80m for Southampton. The Championship median average was £29m, said Maguire.\n\nWyeth said the Trust felt the budgets were \"incredibly risky\".\n\n\"There weren't enough safeguards in there for thinking what could go wrong,\" added Wyeth.\n\n\"We were all saying, what if we get relegated?\n\n\"The fans could see them walking into it.\"\n\nAfter promotion in 2024 the club still had to face up to financial issues.\n\nTrouble had already been signposted by a Profit and Sustainability rule (PSR) charge brought by the Premier League in March 2024. The club successfully appealed against that on a technicality over jurisdiction.\n\nThen the spending in the Championship was the catalyst for a breach of the PSR threshold by £20.8m, which led to the points deduction.\n\nBut there would be no stay in the Premier League to ease their plight as the Foxes went straight back down to the Championship last season, finishing 13 points adrift.\n\n\"They've relied on player sales to dig them out of a really messy situation,\" said Maguire. \"But if you keep selling your best players then that catches up with you.\"\n\nLeicester's battle against financial rules are well-documented. In 2018 the club had to pay the EFL £3.1m to settle a dispute from the 2013-14 season when the club won the Championship.\n\nThis time the punishment for their spending when winning the Championship was in points rather than pounds.\n\nKing Power International Group, which bought the club in 2010, continues to insist the club has done nothing wrong.\n\nReacting to the points deduction on Thursday, it said the punishment was \"disproportionate\" and \"does not adequately reflect the mitigating factors presented\".\n\nYet in the written reasons the commission rejected Leicester's claims they had shown \"exceptional co-operation\".\n\nLeicester's current owners have fought all financial charges at every turn, managing to cause multiple delays.\n\nIt could have been worse, too. One of the sanction mechanisms proposed by the Premier League would have resulted in a 12-point deduction.\n\n\"A lot of fans are saying do not appeal it,\" said Wyeth. \"For God's sake, stop fighting and admit you've messed up.\n\n\"Take the hit and knuckle down and get out of relegation trouble.\"\n\nWyeth fears the board has not learned from the lessons of the past and things could take another downturn.\n\n\"Every game you go to, you think it can't get any worse and then it does,\" she added. \"And that was before we got the points deduction.\"\n\nKey posts remain unfilled. Leicester have no manager after Marti Cifuentes was sacked after just six months in charge. There is no permanent chief executive and no technical director.\n\nWyth said fans were growing tired with \"a lack of transparency about accountability\" and protests were likely to increase.\n\nFans staged a boycott of last month's game against West Brom. The official attendance was 27,130 because all season ticket holders were included.\n\nThe Trust believes the true number was closer to 12,500.\n\n\"We've got the the King Power Out group picking up steam,\" said Wyeth.\n\n\"There are new kinds of protest groups, different protest groups coming together.\"\n\nLeicester have only played in the third tier of English football once in their history and were promoted as champions at the end of it 17 years ago.\n\nTen years to the day from Claudio Ranieri leading the Foxes to that fairytale Premier League success, they could be headed back to League One.\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "title": "'Why young British managers need lower-league experience'",
    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains why he thinks there is a negative reaction to British managers when they get jobs in the Premier League - and the path young coaches should take.",
    "fullText": "It has been interesting to witness the reaction of the media and some supporters at Chelsea over the past few weeks to the appointment of Liam Rosenior.\n\nBeing outside the game for a few years now, I have noticed a real trend of doubt and even negativity about any British managerial appointments by a top-flight club in this country.\n\nWith Liam, who I have known since he was a young player watching my training sessions at Bristol City more than 25 years ago, everything from his experience to his dress sense has been questioned, but his start to life at Chelsea has been exceptional with five wins in seven games.\n\nHis only defeats have come in both legs of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Arsenal.\n\nYes, that exit was a blow but let's remember Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has been in the job for more than six years and has produced, with some enormous financial backing and tremendous loyalty towards him by the club, a team that's one of - if not the best - in England and Europe.\n\nThat huge difference in their circumstances has not stopped Liam being criticised by some for his approach in those ties but he has spent almost a decade working his socks off to gain the experience that warrants this opportunity - and his experiences lower down the leagues and in Europe will have taught him the harshness of management and the reaction you get to every defeat.\n\nHis path is one I think more young British managers may need to pursue, in order to get a chance like he has.\n\nAs a former manager who worked at every professional level in England, you get to realise in the lower leagues what pressure you put yourself under, whether you are winning or losing.\n\nAlong with being able to ignore outside noise from the media outlets, one of my biggest assets was how I managed myself, on a day-to-day basis, and dealt with the stress of the job.\n\nLiam will need to do that tenfold at one of England's elite clubs, where scrutiny is so profound.\n\nLet's hope he gets the time and backing Arteta has received at Arsenal, because I believe it's vital to our national game that young British managers are given a chance by Premier League clubs, and if he succeeds then others can follow.\n\nThere are few other British bosses of any age in the Premier League at present - just six permanent bosses in total (far fewer than the number of 'home' managers in every other major league in Europe) - as well as Michael Carrick who is at Manchester United until the end of the season.\n\nOne of them, Eddie Howe, has proved at Newcastle without doubt that given, time and backing, British managers can be successful, and one day hopefully we will be applauding his appointment as the new England manager.\n\nAnd not far from Stamford Bridge, another young homegrown manager is showing his worth. Ireland's Keith Andrews was again not universally welcomed into the job at Brentford last summer, but just take a look at what he has achieved this season so far.\n\nIt is absolute necessary to our national game that, with the enormous amount of money spent, courses run and facilities produced, the young British or Irish coaches of today can relate to homegrown managers being successful at the top level, to give them the mentors to strive to follow and hopefully better.\n\nThe challenges today for coaches and players to do that are far greater, given that the Premier League is a world league.\n\nThis was never the case when I was growing up and then making my way as a manager. In the 1980s and 90s, English clubs were managed by British managers, Bob Paisley, Brian Clough, Alex Ferguson, Bobby Robson, Howard Kendall, Howard Wilkinson and George Graham. There were also great coaches like Don Howe and Dave Sexton too.\n\nAnd then there were the over-achievers like Bobby Gould at Wimbledon, John Sillett at Coventry and Lawrie McMenemy at Southampton, who all won the FA Cup with so-called smaller clubs.\n\nAt the same time, Martin O'Neill, Alan Curbishley and Peter Reid were breaking through, while John Toshack, Bobby Robson and Terry Venables were making new waves abroad. I apologise to the many other successful managers I haven't mentioned, but I only have so much room!\n\nAll these managers had different characters and approaches but what they have in common is that they were given the opportunity to prove their worth - something that is no longer the case for many British coaches and managers now.\n\nAt the end of the 1990's, Arsene Wenger, who was so prominent in opening the door to the influx of foreign managers in England, joined Arsenal.\n\nMany other top managers have followed - Mauricio Pochettino, Jose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola, Antonio Conte, Rafa Benitez and Claudio Ranieri are among the very best.\n\nThat in itself was purely a positive for our game and for myself personally too - I always believed in competition and to pit my wits against the above was a fantastic experience.\n\nThey were all fortunate to manage top clubs in England and become very successful doing it, while alongside these top managers arrived an array of fantastic players from all over the world.\n\nThe Premier League had more competition with managers arriving from abroad and also players coming in from all quarters of the world. It was imperative that the British coaches and players stepped up to the challenge, but right now it does not feel as if that is being allowed to happen.\n\nAlong with the success of foreign coaches came a belief that coaches from abroad were the only direction that owners - many of them being from abroad too - should go for.\n\nThis belief has, without a doubt affected the opportunities given to younger British coaches over the past decade and before, even if not all the foreign coaches arriving here matched the quality or success of the above.\n\nThe likes of Frank de Boer, Jacques Santini, Juande Ramos and Andre Villas Boas all struggled to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.\n\nMany more foreign coaches have arrived and brought with them tremendous success, but I do believe that our own young coaches given the opportunity could as Liam, Keith and Eddie have shown, be as successful given the chance - we should always judge managers on merit and not perception.\n\nAs I've mentioned in this column before, I always knew I wanted to stay in the game as a coach and manager after my playing days were over.\n\nI passed all my main coaching qualifications by the time I was 21, which allowed me to attend the managers and coaches' week at Lilleshall at the end of every season.\n\nIt was run by the Football Association, with regional coaches organising the programme for the week.\n\nNot only was I exposed to our elite coaches, but got to sit down and listen to the likes of Venables, Graham and Malcolm Allison talking over breakfast or dinner about the sessions being put on outdoors on the pitches.\n\nFor me, it was awe inspiring. These fantastic football people were devoted to the game we all love and I believed British coaches were at the top of the football world. They were fantastic mentors in so many ways.\n\nMy journey to eventually reaching the status of a Premier League manager started in the lower leagues, and I was fortunate to have been promoted out of every league.\n\nMy experience, my strengths and also my faults were all gained or worked on every week, in those surroundings.\n\nToday, academy football seems to be the new breeding ground for our young and up and coming coaches. Academy football is a great starting process on the ladder upwards, but I do believe these young coaches must experience the winning factor, outside of youth development and in lower league football.\n\nTo learn the difference, is imperative to their future success. Some outstanding managers played and coached in non-league and lower league surroundings and gained experience that was useful in more glamorous surroundings.\n\nJim Smith, Ron Atkinson, Dave Bassett and David Pleat, to name just a few, all earned their stripes lower down the leagues, before becoming top managers in England. It was the same more recently with Sam Allardyce, Harry Redknapp and Alan Pardew too.\n\nSome academy coaches have survived early baptisms when given their chances, but I believe the overall experiences lower down the pyramid cannot be matched.\n\nManaging in the academy is like shadow boxing, you don't get your supporters baying at you if you lose, you don't experience people above you questioning your selection or tactics, or players knocking your door about not playing or wanting to leave.\n\nI will always advise young players to get out and play in men's football if they can, because then you experience playing for a manager whose job is on the line if you don't play well, as well as paying crowds, criticism from the stands, the media and senior players.\n\nAcademy football can and does get bogged down with theory, when what these young coaches need is more practicality to understand real management situations.\n\nCoaching to develop is important, but when you are in the hot seat, no matter what level you are managing at, coaching to win is so much different.\n\nI really do hope that more British managers get opportunities to find that out in the Premier League and that gaining promotion out of the Championship will not be the only realistic route to achieving that dream.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League have confirmed the updated squad lists for the remainder of the 2025/26 season, with Arsenal making few changes to the senior squad list.\n\nWith no first-team signings in January, there was no one to add, though perhaps it’s worth noting that Mikel Merino remains on the list despite his long-term injury. So he’ll be eligible to play if and when he returns to fitness.\n\nOn the u21 list, Arsenal have added Evan Mooney and Jaden Dixon after their January moves from St. Mirren and Stoke City. So both will be eligible for Premier League action if called upon.\n\nThe good news with Mooney is that he’s joined before the end of the season in which he turned 18. That means if he spends the next three full seasons with Arsenal he’ll gain homegrown status, something he wasn’t eligible to get whilst playing in Scotland.\n\nIn the meantime, Mooney can be named in the unlimited u21 list, so he’ll never need to use up a non-homegrown senior squad spot.\n\nBack on the squad lists, Ethan Nwaneri has been named on Arsenal’s u21 list despite going out on loan. As mentioned, there’s no limit to the number of u21 players you can include, so there’s no negative consequence to leaving a player on there whilst on loan.\n\nMax Dowman isn’t included on the list, but he’s still eligible to play. The u21 list published by the Premier League only includes players on professional contracts and scholarship deals, and Dowman is still currently too young to begin his scholarship.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has urged fans to be patient with club-record signing Nick Woltemade now the rest of the Premier League is getting to know the German striker's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWoltemade made a fine start to his time in English football following his pre-season arrival from Stuttgart for a fee of £69 million ($94 million) with six goals in his first 11 games for northeast side Newcastle.\n\nBut the goals have dried up for the 23-year-old, who has failed to find the back of the net in his last 12 appearances\n\n\"He is young, (it's) a new league,\" Howe said of Woltemade in the build-up to Saturday's match at home to seventh-placed Brentford -- four positions above Newcastle in the table.\n\n\"He started so well and I think everybody expected that to continue but I think that is very difficult to do, as much as we wanted that to happen for him.\n\n\"He is getting to grips with the challenges of the Premier League -- the speed, the intensity and the physicality.\n\n\"And of course teams are getting to know him as well and I think that is the biggest challenge for him. Teams understand his game and what he wants to do so he has to find solutions the other way.\n\n\"You have to keep ahead of the other teams so there is work for him to do but I think he has done everything with such a great attitude and great way. That is the biggest thing for me he needs to do to be successful.\"\n\nNewcastle go into Saturday's match after the League Cup holders' defence of their first major domestic trophy in 70 years ended on Wednesday as Manchester City completed a 5-1 aggregate semi-final win.\n\nThat defeat at the Etihad Stadium led to intense social media speculation that the 48-year-old Howe had taken Newcastle as far as he can amid suggestions he could replace Thomas Tuchel as England manager after the World Cup.\n\nNewcastle, however, are just seven points off the top five and still involved in the Champions League -- they face Azerbaijani side Qarabag over two legs for a place in the last 16 later this month -- and the FA Cup.\n\nHowe, responding to all the commentary about his future at St James' Park, said: \"That's a surprise to me. I give my best to the football club every single day, to all the players and the staff. I try to be the best version of myself to inspire the team to win games.\n\n\"That's my only thought. I don't tend to look too far ahead, but I try to prepare and plan for the club to move forward in every sense. My individual future isn't really relevant.\n\n\"Who knows? I don't know my length of time here, I've got no idea. I just try to do my best every day until told differently.\"",

We can both laugh about it now.\"\n\nMilner is set to go level with Gareth Barry, who played 653 times, at the top of the all-time Premier League appearance list some 8,491 days after making his debut for hometown club Leeds United soon after leaving school in 2002.\n\n\"I think that will be a special thing for him but he is focused on top of that on the ambitions from the club as well. He wants to be always successful like he was his whole life,\" said Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler.\n\n\"He is a driver of this winning mentality and I think it's very important to have these kind of players in the squad.\n\n\"They know how to win, they know what it needs to win, how you need to prepare a game, how you react in bad phases like on bad runs we have at the moment.\"\n\nAlan Shearer, who played with Milner at Newcastle, describes him as a model professional and a \"manager's dream\".\n\n\"You would do well if you had him in your squad because you knew exactly what you were going to get,\" adds former England captain Shearer.\n\nThis is the story about a young lad from Leeds who evolved to set standards for hard work, professionalism and longevity - and earn respect from fans all over the world.\n\nMilner was just 16 and earning £70 a week as a YTS player when he broke into the first team at Leeds, six months after taking his GCSE exams.\n\nOn 10 November 2002, his dad Peter was in the away end at Upton Park when boss Terry Venables sent the youngster on for Jason Wilcox, now director of football at Manchester United, in the final minutes of a 4-3 win against West Ham.\n\nIt was a dream come true for Milner, who had grown up supporting the club and wore shirts with the names of Tony Yeboah and Tony Dorigo on the back.\n\nSix weeks after the West Ham game, Milner - aged 16 years and 356 days - became the youngest Premier League goalscorer at that time when he scored in a 2-1 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.\n\nIt was not enough to get the former Leeds season ticket-holder out of his post-match duties, however.\n\nBack then YTS players were expected to clean the dressing room after first-team games.\n\n\"Even when I was playing and scoring goals, after games I was helping the kit man pick dirty shirts off the dressing room floor,\" Milner told the High Performance podcast, external in 2023.\n\n\"I carried on cleaning the under-18 captain's boots. I was playing in the first team but he was still older than me.\"\n\nIt was not long, however, before Milner was sent on loan to the third tier of English football to continue his football education.\n\nSome 17-year-olds might have sulked at the prospect of swapping the glamour of the Premier League for games against Grimsby and Peterborough.\n\nMilner saw it as a chance to show what he was all about.\n\nDuring four weeks in Wiltshire, Milner played six games and scored two goals.\n\nSam Parkin, who was at Swindon at the same time as Milner, remembers a committed and hard-working teenager eager to learn.\n\n\"James was determined, driven and focused compared to some of the other young lads we had from Premier League clubs,\" recalls Parkin.\n\n\"He made a goal for me against Brighton at the Withdean Stadium and I remember us both scoring in a win against Peterborough.\"\n\nMilner describes his time in the lower leagues as a \"bit of an eye-opener\", with Swindon's players bringing their own pasta to eat on the team bus.\n\nYet he impressed with his attitude and performances, says Parkin.\n\n\"Before James went back to Leeds I told him: 'I never want to see you back here because you've got too much quality for this level',\" he adds.\n\nMilner returned to Elland Road where he became a first-team regular alongside the likes of Mark Viduka and Alan Smith.\n\nHe 'celebrated' his 18th birthday by playing in a 4-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal before relegation at the end of the 2003-04 season resulted in Leeds selling players to raise money.\n\nEngland forward Smith moved to Manchester United in a deal worth £7m, goalkeeper Paul Robinson went to Tottenham for £1.5m, while Milner signed for Newcastle in a deal worth £5m.\n\nNewcastle had just finished fifth in the Premier League, Sir Bobby Robson was manager and Shearer wore the captain's armband.\n\nIt was at Newcastle, however, that Milner would go on to experience one of the lowest moments of his career.\n\nShearer remembers Milner having a desire to learn and improve.\n\n\"He had a great mentality to get better, to be patient, but also to be frustrated and angry - you get that at times during your career.\"\n\nRobson lost his job four games into the 2004-05 season and was replaced by Graeme Souness, the former Liverpool and Scotland midfielder.\n\nA year after signing for Newcastle, Milner was sent out on loan to Premier League rivals Aston Villa.\n\nSouness defended his decision at the time saying \"you won't win the league with James Milners\". The remark, for which Souness has since apologised,, external stung the young winger, who would go on and win three Premier League titles.\n\nYet there was more turbulence ahead.\n\nMilner had impressed on loan at Villa so much that in September 2006 they offered around £4m to sign him permanently.\n\nNewcastle accepted and Milner travelled to the West Midlands only to learn upon arrival at Villa Park that the Magpies had pulled out of the deal at the 11th hour at the end of the transfer window.\n\nMilner was bitterly frustrated.\n\nIt would be another two years before he finally sealed a permanent switch to Villa at the age of 22 after 94 top-flight appearances for Newcastle.\n\nFor two seasons he played under Martin O'Neill before another move in 2010.\n\nChelsea had just won a Premier League and FA Cup double under Carlo Ancelotti and wanted to add Milner to their squad.\n\nManchester City were also keen. The trouble was, they had not won anything significant since 1976.\n\nIn the end he opted for the challenge of reviving City's fortunes.\n\nHe left five years later having helped them win two Premier League titles, one FA Cup, one League Cup and one Community Shield.\n\nMilner proved a versatile servant for both Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini, playing in a variety of positions including a stint as a lone striker - and he was popular in the dressing room.\n\n\"We won the Premier League together in 2012 but there were times that season when things were not going well,\" recalls former City defender Micah Richards.\n\n\"He was one of the people who kept everyone going.\"\n\nRichards developed a close bond with Milner but remembers getting the blame for the parody 'Boring James Milner' social media account, which mocked the player, often focusing on ironing, tea and trivial match details.\n\n\"Everyone thought I was behind it,\" says Richards.\n\n\"Whenever a new post went up Milner would say, 'Come on, mate, you've had your fun'. I'd be going, 'I swear, Millie, it's not me!'\n\n\"I ended up messaging the guy behind it, saying, 'Who is this because Milner thinks it's me?'\n\n\"He would not disclose his name but he sent me a picture of himself and it was just some random bloke. I just told him, 'Keep it up - I love it!'\"\n\nMilner played along with the 'boring' tag and during lockdown posted a video of himself cutting his lawn with scissors.\n\nAfter 147 top-flight appearances for City, he was ready for his next challenge.\n\nNext stop...Liverpool, where he won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Uefa Super Cup, Fifa Club World Cup and the Community Shield.\n\nIt was not all trophies and smiles, however, at Anfield.\n\nThere was that red card from his former teacher - and then the time he angered Klopp.\n\n\"One time at half-time he [Klopp] was sharing his thoughts and I was sharing mine,\" Milner adds on the High Performance podcast.\n\n\"I remember him smashing his hands down on the table and saying, 'Will you shut up'. But Jurgen was great, I had a great relationship with him.\"\n\nAfter Liverpool came an offer from Brighton in 2023 to prolong his top-flight career, where he continues to compete in what is his 24th Premier League season.\n\nMilner, who is eight years older than Seagulls boss Hurzeler, became the Premier League's second-oldest goalscorer behind Teddy Sheringham when he scored from the penalty spot against his former club Manchester City earlier this season.\n\nHe celebrated by recreating Diogo Jota's trademark video game controller celebration in tribute to his former Liverpool team-mate, who died in a car crash last July.\n\nMilner is wearing the No 20 shirt for Brighton, the same number Jota wore at Liverpool.\n\n\"I've not scored [in the Premier League] for six years and I was wearing his number. Obviously, I've got help from the great man,\" said an emotional Milner after the match.\n\nWhere does the player who represented England at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups rank on the list of all-time Premier League greats?\n\n\"Milner's name never really is mentioned as one of the greats, but he is, without a doubt,\" says Richards.\n\nFormer Leeds and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson, who played the night Milner made his debut at West Ham in 2002, said his former team-mate had dedicated his life to remain at the top level.\n\n\"It's everything you do, it's how you walk around at home, it's what shoes you wear, it's how you sleep, it's what pillows you sleep on, it's what you eat, it's what you put in your body,\" says Robinson.\n\n\"And for him to have evolved the way that the game's evolved as well, it's huge credit to himself as a person, not just a footballer, but as a person.\"\n\nWill Milner carry on playing when his contract expires in the summer? Having turned 40 in January, he treats every game as though it could be his last.\n\nHe still remembers a conversation with veteran Leeds goalkeeper Nigel Martyn soon after breaking into the first team 24 years ago.\n\n\"He told me, 'Enjoy it while you can because it goes so fast'. I said, 'Leave it out, Nige, I'm 16!'\n\n\"And here we are in the blink of an eye - and I'm where he was.\"\n\nMilner sent off by former PE teacher\n\nLatest Brighton news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Brighton - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Another pivotal Premier League gameweek awaits, with several sides locked in relegation battles and crucial clashes shaping the title race.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester City headline the round in a fixture that could significantly impact Arsenal’s advantage at the top.\n\nManchester United will look to continue their resurgence under interim boss Michael Carrick, while Spurs aim to halt their inconsistency.\n\nAt the bottom end, multiple six-pointers offer teams a chance to create daylight between themselves and the drop zone. With form fluctuating across the table, this gameweek promises tension, drama, and fine margins.\n\nLeeds will be hopeful of delivering a much-improved performance after a disappointing 4–0 defeat to Arsenal last week.\n\nThe Whites must be sharper in front of goal and defensively disciplined if they are to get a result against Nottingham Forest.\n\nForest were unable to capitalise against an out-of-sorts Crystal Palace side dealing with off-field issues.\n\nWith both teams level on 26 points, this clash represents a potential six-pointer in the relegation battle and should make for a tense encounter.\n\nJaka Bijol and Lukas Nmecha are doubts for Leeds, while Anton Stach is ruled out. James Justin has made a full recovery and is expected to be available.\n\nFor Forest, Matz Sels and Callum Hudson-Odoi are doubts, while Neco Williams is suspended.\n\nA last-minute strike from Benjamin Šeško earned Manchester United their third consecutive win since Michael Carrick took charge as interim manager.\n\nThe Red Devils have found their rhythm in attack while maintaining defensive discipline, making them favourites to extend their unbeaten run to six matches when Spurs visit Old Trafford.\n\nTottenham showed resilience by coming back from two goals down against Manchester City last week. Improved second-half performances saw Dominic Solanke score twice to rescue a point.\n\nThat level of intensity will be required again if Spurs are to trouble Carrick’s side.\n\nMicky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, and Dominic Solanke have all been passed fit, while Djed Spence is a doubt.\n\nArsenal will be keen to secure all three points after an entertaining draw in the reverse fixture at the Stadium of Light.\n\nThe Gunners returned to winning ways by dismantling Leeds last week, extending their lead at the top of the table to six points.\n\nThey also booked their place in the League Cup final by completing a semi-final double over Chelsea at the Emirates.\n\nSunderland picked up an important victory against Burnley last week to move back into the top half of the table. It was just the Black Cats’ second win in five games.\n\nMartin Ødegaard is a doubt for Arsenal, while Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino are ruled out through injury.\n\nBournemouth secured a routine 2–0 win over Wolves last week, making it three wins in their last four matches and four games unbeaten.\n\nThe Cherries appear to have adjusted well following Antoine Semenyo’s departure.\n\nAston Villa, meanwhile, were frustrated in a goalless draw against 10-man Brentford despite playing with a numerical advantage from the 42nd minute.\n\nThe dropped points saw Villa fall one point behind second-placed Manchester City and seven behind leaders Arsenal. David Brooks is a doubt for Bournemouth, while Ollie Watkins is a doubt for Villa.\n\nThis is a clash between 18th and 19th on the league table. Burnley failed to extend their unbeaten run to four matches after a tepid 3–0 defeat to Sunderland.\n\nThe Clarets’ performance was disappointing, and Scott Parker will demand a significant response.\n\nWest Ham suffered a second-half collapse last week, surrendering a two-goal lead against Chelsea.\n\nDespite that setback, the Hammers come into this clash as slight favourites based on recent performances. Jean-Clair Todibo remains suspended.\n\nFulham’s defensive frailties were exposed last week when Manchester United snatched all three points courtesy of a last-minute Šeško winner.\n\nPrior to that goal, the Cottagers had shown resilience by fighting back from two goals down to level the match deep into stoppage time.\n\nUnlike Fulham, Everton were beneficiaries of late drama, with Beto scoring in the 97th minute to rescue a point against Brighton.\n\nThe result extended the Toffees’ unbeaten run to four games and lifted them into the top half of the table.\n\nWolves’ brief resurgence has come to an abrupt end following back-to-back defeats.\n\nRob Edwards’ side looked devoid of ideas in their loss to Bournemouth and could face a tough afternoon when Chelsea visit Molineux. Ladislav Krejčí is a slight doubt.\n\nChelsea will be eager to bounce back from their League Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal.\n\nThe Blues have won their last three league matches, with Enzo Fernández and João Pedro shouldering the attacking burden.\n\nFilip Jørgensen, Reece James, and Pedro Neto are doubts, while Jamie Gittens is ruled out long-term with a hamstring injury.\n\nNewcastle exited the League Cup after a heavy 5–1 aggregate defeat to Manchester City.\n\nThe Magpies have also struggled in the league, failing to win any of their last three matches, and European qualification now looks unlikely.\n\nBruno Guimarães and Lewis Miley are doubts, while Anthony Gordon is ruled out with a hamstring injury.\n\nBrentford showed immense resilience to secure a 1–0 win over Aston Villa despite playing more than half the match with ten men. The victory moved the Bees to within five points of fourth-placed Manchester United.\n\nBrighton will be without Yasin Ayari due to a shoulder injury, but Diego Gómez has been passed fit.\n\nThe Seagulls were denied victory by a late Everton equaliser last week, extending their winless run to four matches.\n\nCrystal Palace earned just their second point in five games with a 1–1 draw against Nottingham Forest.\n\nOngoing off-field issues appear to be affecting performances, with the Eagles now sitting 15th, nine points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nLiverpool host Manchester City in the standout fixture of the gameweek at Anfield.\n\nThe Reds will be seeking revenge after a 3–0 defeat in the reverse fixture and will take confidence from their emphatic 4–1 win over Newcastle last week.\n\nJeremie Frimpong remains sidelined, while Joe Gomez faces a late fitness test.\n\nManchester City need a win to keep pace with Arsenal in the title race. Pep Guardiola’s side have won just one of their last five league matches and now sit six points behind the leaders.\n\nA second-half collapse against Spurs last week highlighted recent inconsistencies. Rúben Dias is ruled out, while Bernardo Silva is a doubt.",

    "fullText": "Having won only one of their past six Premier League games and drawn 2-2 at Tottenham after being 2-0 up, can second-placed Manchester City get back on track at Liverpool on Sunday?\n\n\"I wouldn't rule City out of anything at the moment\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\n\"But the way they folded in the second half against Tottenham was a real worry.\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 25 is Gladiators star Apollo, real name Alex Gray, who supports Newcastle.\n\nBefore becoming a Gladiator, the 6ft 6in Gray played Premiership rugby for three teams and also American Football for NFL side Atlanta Falcons.\n\nHe is part of Channel 5's Big Game Night NFL coverage and they are live on Super Bowl Sunday on 8 February from 22:30 GMT.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own Premier League predictions below - and for the Super Bowl too!\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nThe NFL's influence can be seen in the Premier League through the kind of choreographed corner routines that are now commonplace, and Apollo can understand why Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has shared ideas with Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay.\n\nApollo told BBC Sport: \"While football is quite a free-flowing game you do have these set-pieces and if you need some inspiration of how to make things happen then the NFL is a good place to look at, because that's what they do all day every day - not just on offence but on defence as well.\n\n\"What you are always trying to get in the NFL is mismatches, and that's exactly the same in football for some of the big guys coming in and trying to put the ball in the back of the net with a header or whatever.\n\n\"The level of detail that goes into that in the NFL is incredible. I remember my days there in training camp would start with breakfast at 7.30am and some days you wouldn't leave the meeting rooms until 11pm.\n\n\"We were only on the field for two hours max and in the gym for another hour, and the rest would be meetings and analysis.\n\n\"The scrutiny on every individual is so high so I can see why other sports would look at that and try to implement it themselves to find some weakness in the opposition armour. Arteta must have been thinking it is a way to help his team win games.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Apollo - aka Alex Gray - were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.\n\nI am at this game and we are getting to the stage where it really matters how the teams fighting relegation do in their head-to-head-battles like this.\n\nI think the bottom two, Wolves and Burnley are down, but you don't know what West Ham will do from here.\n\nThere are signs they may click, so with Leeds and Nottingham Forest both on 26 points, this is big for both of them.\n\nFrom a Leeds point of view, their home form has carried them a lot this season.\n\nThey got walloped at Elland Road by Arsenal last weekend but they just have to put that behind them for this game because, as the season has gone on, they have proved they can be competitive.\n\nForest's away form is actually better than their home form - they have picked up 14 points on the road compared to 12 at the City Ground, in the same number of games.\n\nSean Dyche's side were comfortable with 10 men in the draw against Crystal Palace last time out and they have won their past two away games, against Brentford and the Hammers. Overall, they are unbeaten in four league games, which is the longest they have gone without losing all season.\n\nAs you can see, I've looked into all the stats for you - but will my research help me get my prediction right? Probably not.\n\nThis is going to be a very tight affair and Forest won't worry about having much possession, but scoring goals has been a bigger problem for them because they have missed Chris Wood badly - only Wolves have scored fewer than them.\n\nForest have brought in 6ft 7in striker Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli to try to fill the gap left by Wood's long-term knee injury but he has not been in great form in Serie A this season.\n\nSo, after a great deal of thought, I am going to back Leeds at home - although now I've said that it will probably end up as a 1-1 draw.\n\nApollo's prediction: When I looked at the fixtures I was thinking about who in the Gladiators supports who. Two of the guys, Giant and Hammer, are big Forest fans so I am going for a Leeds win here. It should be a good game though. 3-2\n\nManchester United were slightly fortunate to beat Fulham last time out. A draw would have been about right.\n\nStill, it was big for Benjamin Sesko to get their winner and I have got to say he put it away very nicely, especially because he should have scored with a header earlier in the game.\n\nTottenham, meanwhile, produced a great comeback against Manchester City. I've talked about how much I rate Dominic Solanke and when he is up for Spurs, they are in a much better place as a team.\n\nThere is a danger of getting carried away with United under Michael Carrick, and I am expecting Solanke to score again here, but it still feels like United will find a way to win it.\n\nApollo's prediction: Tottenham have an affinity with the NFL and I've been to a couple of games there so I am backing them here. 0-1\n\nLosing back-to-back home league games against Everton and Brentford has been a real killer for Aston Villa, who have so many injuries to contend with in their midfield.\n\nAfter a long wait for a win, Bournemouth have now won three of their past four league games - and I make them favourites at home here.\n\nVilla thumped the Cherries 4-0 at Villa Park in November, and I have got a lot of their players in my Fantasy team, but this is going to be a very different game.\n\nI've gone for 2-1 wins in my first two games and I don't really want to go for that scoreline again here, but I feel like I have no choice. I do think Villa will score - Morgan Rogers is always dangerous and Tammy Abraham is a clever signing up front - but Bournemouth will edge it.\n\nApollo's prediction: It's great for Villa to be in a title race. 1-2\n\nI am not going to say 2-1 for this one. Instead it will be another Arsenal clean sheet - they have already kept 12 in their first 24 league games, two more than any other team.\n\nIt's a shame Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka is not fit to face his old club at the Emirates. When he played for the Black Cats against Arsenal in their draw at the Stadium of Light, they were the first team I saw who really rattled the Gunners.\n\nXhaka's experience has helped to glue together a Sunderland side with a lot of young players this season, but they coped all right without him against Burnley on Monday.\n\nThis is a much tougher game for them, obviously, and Sunderland's away form is nowhere near as strong as it is at home.\n\nArsenal swept Leeds aside 4-0 last weekend, when everyone thought they were having a bit of a blip.\n\nThey showed their strength in depth at Elland Road, when they lost Bukayo Saka in the warm-up, and I can see them winning comfortably this time too.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is very easy for me because Legend and Fire both support Arsenal and are real die-hard fans - Legend even has a cannon tattoo - so being absolutely honest I would love Sunderland to win, and do it for the north-east! 0-2\n\nI think Burnley are down but this is their chance to prove me wrong.\n\nThey need it to be - they are at home, against a team one place above them in the table, so this is their big chance to end their long wait for a win.\n\nI just don't see it happening for the Clarets, though.\n\nAs I said earlier, I am not sure which West Ham side will turn up but they have shown some improvement recently, especially in attack.\n\nI don't think the Hammers will keep a clean sheet because they have had only one all season - the fewest by any top-flight team - but I don't see Burnley beating them.\n\nApollo's prediction: My cousins are lifelong Burnley fans and season-ticket holders so if I didn't back them here, I'd be in a lot of trouble. The former NFL player, JJ Watt, is a co-owner of the club too, so for the NFL links and family ties, it's got to be a home win. 2-1\n\nEverton asked about Fulham forward Harry Wilson on deadline day.\n\nHe has been a revelation this season and they won't be looking forward to facing him on Saturday.\n\nThe Toffees have got something after falling behind in their past three league games, including the last-gasp equaliser against Brighton that saw poor David Moyes booked for his celebration - there is no way you should get a yellow card for that.\n\nThis is going to be another close game and it smells of another 2-1 to me, but I am not going to go down that road again this week.\n\nInstead, I'm going for a different scoreline but sticking with a narrow Fulham win. Marco Silva will feel his side deserved something from Old Trafford and it will be him celebrating at the final whistle this week, not Moyes.\n\nApollo's prediction: We don't like draws in the NFL but this might up all-square. 1-1\n\nChelsea were accused of being too negative in their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal in midweek, but I can't see that being the case here.\n\nI was far too optimistic about Wolves last week when I said they would draw with Bournemouth and I am not making the same mistake this time.\n\nThe games have been coming thick and fast for Chelsea and I actually admire their manager Liam Rosenior for the way he changed things up in their 3-2 comeback win over West Ham after being 2-0 down.\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards has probably got one eye on preparing for next season in the Championship, and his side will be one step nearer to that after this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: I went to a couple of Chelsea games when I lived in London and they will get the job done here. 1-2\n\nYou just wonder how much Newcastle have got left in the tank after their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat at Manchester City on Wednesday.\n\nThe Magpies have a few injuries to contend with too, with Anthony Gordon the latest player to be sidelined, so they will have to dig deep and hope Bruno Guimaraes is back fit in time for this game.\n\nBrentford got one heck of a win last time out at Villa, and their manager Keith Andrews deserves a lot of credit for getting that result despite being down to 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nThe Bees are always so well organised at the back, and how Eddie Howe's side try to break them down will be the key to this one.\n\nAs good as Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade is with his back to goal, he doesn't run in behind.\n\nDoing that, and attacking with pace, is how Eddie Howe's side look the most dangerous - Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga will have to do that here, and I fancy Yoane Wissa to score against his former club.\n\nApollo on why he supports Newcastle: I am from a small town in County Durham - my grandmother went to school with Sir Bobby Robson - so I had the choice of Newcastle, Sunderland or Middlesbrough. I know it is absolute blasphemy to say this, but I like to see all the north-east clubs do well.\n\nNewcastle are my team though, because that's who I went to watch first - I went to see them against Ipswich in 2000, and Alan Shearer scored a couple - and it is my city as well. I played rugby for them and I lived there. It's a fantastic place and it's even better when the team is going well.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is going to be a Newcastle win, it's just a case of how much. Brentford's performance coach Ben Ryan used to coach me for England Sevens, then he went to Fiji and got a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, so it would be nice to get one over him as well. 3-1\n\nPalace have brought in Jorgen Strand Larsen, and kept Jean-Philippe Mateta, so Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has got some options up front.\n\nI normally predict a draw in this game, and it ended up 0-0 at Selhurst Park in November. This time, though, I fancy Brighton.\n\nThe Seagulls didn't quite get over the line against Everton, but them conceding late on actually won me some points. I am going for them to keep a clean sheet here though.\n\nApollo's prediction: Palace to edge it. 0-1\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola starts with Omar Marmoush up front ahead of Erling Haaland after his two goals against Newcastle in midweek, but their attack looks strong anyway with Rayan Cherki and Antoine Semenyo in the team.\n\nThe same applies to Liverpool, who have got a striker in form in Hugo Ekitike, while Florian Wirtz is playing with confidence too.\n\nCity will have moments where they will create chances, but Liverpool are going to have opportunities at the other end as well - there will be a few goals in this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is the 'Super Bowl' game of the weekend in the Premier League so I've gone for an NFL-type score as well as a football one. 22-31 (2-3)\n\nSuper Bowl, Levi's Stadium 23:30 GMT\n\nI haven't got a clue about the NFL and I never played gridiron - my nose would be too big and would stick out of the helmet - but I am going for the Seahawks to down the Patriots on Sunday.\n\nSeattle is a really nice place and I played in their stadium for Celtic, so they get my backing here... although that's probably bad news for them, going by how I've done at predictions this season.\n\nApollo's prediction: The Seahawks' defensive coordinator, Aden Durde, was part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program that took me to Atlanta. If he gets a Super Bowl, it would be the biggest accomplishment from someone from Britain in the NFL. 21-18\n\nFor the second successive week, the outcome went to the final game.\n\nChris, the BBC readers and AI were all level on 80 points going into Monday's match between Sunderland and Burnley, with his guest - boxer Francesca Hennessy - on 40 points.\n\nChris and Francesca went for a 1-0 Black Cats victory, the BBC readers thought they would win 2-0, while AI picked a 1-1 draw.\n\nSunderland were 2-0 up after 32 minutes but the BBC readers' hopes of an outright win were scuppered when Chemsdine Talbi scored their third goal, 18 minutes from time.\n\nThat meant Chris and the BBC readers tied for victory - they both managed six correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 matches in week 24, for a total of 90 points.\n\nAI managed five correct results with one correct score for a tally of 80 points, while Francesca also managed five correct results but with no exact scores, leaving her on 50 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.\n\nPlayers earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.\n\nThe top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.\n\nIf players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.\n\nThursday, 12 February - FAS Dome, Antwerp\n\nQuarter-finals (from 19:15 GMT)\n\nJonny Clayton v Stephen Bunting",

A victory will be huge for the Gunners as they look to win the Premier League title, but manager Mikel Arteta could have fresh injury concerns. Arsenal had an open training this morning and the trio of Jurrien Timber, Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard were not involved, according to Sky Sports.\n\nWhile Saka missed the game against Chelsea on Tuesday due to a knock he picked up shortly before kick-off against Leeds United last Saturday, Timber played the whole game and Arsenal fans could be worried about his fitness. Odegaard was left out of the Gunners’ squad for their Carabao Cup semi-final as a precaution, and it remains to be seen whether he will return to training ahead of the weekend.\n\nThe Norwegian featured against Leeds, coming off the bench to play 29 minutes. Arsenal need their key players against Sunderland and Arteta will be hoping for some good news on the fitness of the aforementioned trio. He admitted that Odegaard felt a niggle during the Leeds game and was not feeling comfortable on Monday.\n\nThe Arsenal skipper will be desperate to be available for the weekend after he was started on the bench against the Whites.",

    "description": "“Neil and Patterson delivered Sunderland back to the Premier League, and in doing so helped usher in an era that ultimately moved beyond them”, writes James Hunter.",
    "fullText": "Wembley Stadium, 4:59pm on 24 May 2025, was a seismic moment.\n\nWho can forget Tommy Watson’s 95th-minute winner against Sheffield United in the Championship play-off final?\n\nIt ended Sunderland’s eight-year wait for a long-overdue return to the Premier League and set the stage for the magnificent season Régis Le Bris and his side are currently enjoying.\n\nEight months on, the aftershocks of that day — and the paradigm shift it triggered — continue.\n\nI write, of course, in the wake of the departures of Dan Neil and Anthony Patterson, two of Sunderland’s Wembley heroes and mainstays of that promotion-winning side.\n\nMidfielder Neil started all but two league games last season — one of those absences due to suspension — while goalkeeper Patterson started all but four. Both also started all three play-off games.\n\nBut promotion changes everything. It always does.\n\nAnd with Sunderland stepping up a level, the summer was spent building a squad fit to compete in the top flight — a process that left Neil and Patterson among those squeezed out.\n\nSunderland fans loved seeing homegrown stars Neil and Patterson thrive last season, and they would have been thrilled to watch them test themselves in the Premier League.\n\nInstead, Patterson departed without making a top-flight appearance, linking up on loan with former Sunderland boss Alex Neil at Millwall for the remainder of the season. Dan Neil’s involvement on Wearside, meanwhile, was restricted to three substitute outings totalling just 13 minutes before he joined Ipswich Town on loan to play out the final months of his contract.\n\nSentiment is a fine thing, but there is little room for it in the upper echelons of professional sport.\n\nFor all Patterson’s undoubted ability, Sunderland upgraded last summer with the signing of Robin Roefs, while the arrival of Melker Ellborg earlier this year cleared the path for his departure.\n\nAnd while Neil was one of the first names on the teamsheet in the Championship, the equation changes when players of the calibre of Granit Xhaka, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra arrive at the club.\n\nSunderland are moving onwards and upwards, and with that progress comes inevitable change.\n\nNeil and Patterson are simply too good to become perennial substitutes or bit-part Premier League players.\n\nBetter, then, that both have joined clubs competing for play-off places — and perhaps more — at the sharp end of the Championship.\n\nTheir roles in Sunderland’s rise cannot be overstated.\n\nFor Neil, captaining his boyhood club to Wembley glory was the stuff of childhood dreams. And the image of him and fellow Black Cats fan Patterson lifting the play-off trophy together is one that will live long in the memory.\n\nBut Wembley was both a summit and a turning point. Neil and Patterson delivered Sunderland back to the Premier League, and in doing so helped usher in an era that ultimately moved beyond them. That is not failure or rejection, but the price of progress — and one Sunderland can afford to pay because of what they gave.\n\nFollow James Hunter over on X by clicking here!",

    "description": "This is a team which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",
    "fullText": "Monday’s convincing victory over Burnley has virtually guaranteed Sunderland’s Premier League status for next season, with more than a third of fixtures still to play.\n\nIt was also the sixth occasion where the squad has responded to a defeat with a win — that speaks to the mentality of the group of players who have been blended together from last season’s promotion-winning heroes and the carefully selected cohort of summer recruits.\n\nThe ability to bounce back after disappointing performances against the likes of Burnley in August, Manchester United in October and West Ham in January is testament to the belief that Régis Le Bris has instilled in what has proved to be the surprise package of the season.\n\nIt is not just the fact that this is a team full of talented players which gives the squad character. It is that the club have recruited talented players who have the right character to play for this club, and for this coach.\n\nFor a goalkeeper of his age and experience, Robin Roefs should not have the calm temperament to control his area in the manner that he does. Ahead of him, he has Nordi Mukiele whose will to win is demonstrated, not only by his galloping forays down the wing, but by his willingness to put his body on the line. Dan Ballard embodies the ‘Til the end’ mentality that dragged this team back to the Premier League, Omar Alderete has the ice-cool mentality and ruggedness of a South American gangster, and Reinildo wanders round the Academy of Light in January in a sleeveless vest, as if he was back in Mozambique.\n\nTrai Hume has continued to deliver the kind of no-nonsense, hard-as-nails performances that make his price tag the steal of the century, while Granit Xhaka patrols the midfield with the mindset of a military commander determined to deliver victory on the battlefield.\n\nBeside him, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra bring an African energy, skill, enthusiasm and joy that we haven’t seen since the days of Asamoah Gyan, while Enzo Le Fée’s creativity is only matched by his never-say-die attitude to win back the ball every single time the team loses possession.\n\nUp front, Brian Brobbey is delivering the kind of no-nonsense muscular front-man performances that the Sunderland faithful have been desperately seeking for years, shrugging off defenders like annoying flies. On the wing, Chemsdine Talbi not only grafts back defensively but has delivered the spectacular finishes that excite crowds.\n\nAdd to that the loveable Wilson Isidor, Wembley hero Eliezer Mayenda and ‘Mr Sunderland’ Luke O’Nien, and this is a group of players who deserve to be celebrated.\n\nAfter years of watching the likes of Jack Rodwell and others stealing a living from the club, and giving nothing for the badge, let alone everything, this is such a refreshing change. And that is why the fact that the club has only recruited three new players in January should not be a concern.\n\nThe recruitment team have set out their stall. If you want to play for Sunderland, the first question is ‘Are you talented enough?’ If the answer to that is ‘Yes’, the next question is ‘Are you the right type of player, do you have the right mentality?’\n\nRecruiting players who can answer ‘Yes’ to those questions is precisely why we can now spend the last third of the season worrying about how high this squad might finish in the Premier League, rather than whether we will still be in it in August.\n\nLook around at other sides who have prioritised ability over attitude, who have put together a group of players, rather than a team. It is the same approach that allowed Leicester City to achieve the improbable, if not the impossible, by winning the Premier League a decade ago.\n\nThis is a team — the only team unbeaten at home in the Premier League — which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",

The weather conditions were so bad the deadline had to be postponed for 24 hours.\n\nRemember 2013, when West Brom striker Peter Odemwingie got in his car and drove 120 miles from Birmingham to London in the forlorn hope he would sign for Queens Park Rangers.\n\nAnd 2011 produced the greatest winter deadline day of all. Liverpool made the shock signing of Andy Carroll from Newcastle, alongside Luis Suarez from Ajax.\n\nSince then the window has had its moments, but the final day itself has been something of a damp squib.\n\nThe Premier League had its quietest ever winter transfer deadline day on Monday, with just seven deals completed.\n\nYet deadline day has not been packed for a while. In 2024 we saw 13 deals done, then 16 in 2023 and in 2022 it was 14.\n\nThe drama of deadline day has always been something of a quiet affair across the other top leagues.

    "fullText": "The transfers of Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz were two of the biggest in Liverpool's history.\n\nThe duo were seen as the best way for Liverpool to take their next step and to even replace Mohamed Salah in the future.\n\nAnd, while Wirtz is finally getting back to his best, it's clear that some new signings still need to be made at Liverpool.\n\nThis has caused plenty of confusion among the football world, with Paul Merson now slamming the recruitment process undertaken by Hughes.\n\n\"With all the money Liverpool have spent, the squad looks wafer-thin,\" Merson told Sky Sports in quotes relayed by The Mirror.\n\n\"Looking at it now, they got it horribly wrong in the summer.\n\n\"By going bang, bang with a load of attackers and thinking they were going to dominate English football for the next four or five years, it's backfired.\"\n\nEven though attackers were needed to replace Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz at Liverpool, they still spent far too much money.\n\nIsak and Wirtz alone cost the Anfield outfit around £240 million, which, for any team is a massive chunk of change.\n\nThe Reds have often spent their money wisely and have chosen to upgrade multiple areas of their squad, rather than splashing the cash in one place.\n\nAlthough the chances of a new player arriving before January's deadline day look slim, that doesn't mean that they can't eye up potential targets for the 2026-27 summer window.\n\nHowever, if Hughes, Slot and Edwards do end up drafting up a shortlist of potential targets, they must ensure that their entire squad is benefitting, rather than just one area of it.\n\nOtherwise, they could end up in the same situation all over again next year.",

They've slotted in really well, which is testament to them.\"\n\nCrystal Palace's deadline day move for Strand Larsen meant they spent £83m in the winter window, having signed Brennan Johnson for £35m from Tottenham.\n\nAston Villa - who are third - were the only other top-six side to pay out transfer fees during the winter window. They spent £18.25m on bringing back striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas and £10.5m on winger Alysson from Gremio.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal did no business during the winter window, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool - fourth, fifth and sixth respectively - also quiet.\n\nWhile Manchester City spent money to bolster their squad for a title fight, at the other end of the table West Ham splashed out in a bid to avoid relegation to the Championship.\n\nThe Hammers, who are third from bottom and six points adrift of safety, spent a reported £21.8m on Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente and around £25m on striker Taty Castellanos from Lazio.\n\nTottenham, who are 14th, spent £35m on signing midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid, while Bournemouth used some of their money from the Semenyo sale to sign teenage striker Rayan from Vasco da Gama for £24.7m and Hungary midfielder Alex Toth for £10.4m from Ferencvaros.\n\nDespite a quiet deadline day, Premier League clubs still spent more overall in the winter window than sides in other major European leagues.\n\nThe next-biggest spending league was Serie A, with their clubs paying out a combined £205m in transfer fees.\n\nSassuolo were one of the most active Italian clubs, paying £22m for Marseille duo Ismael Kone and Darryl Bakola.\n\nIn Spain, the transfer window closed at 22:59 GMT, but La Liga business was quiet, with Atletico Madrid's £30m deal for Ademola Lookman more than was spent be the rest of the division's clubs combined (£20.3m).\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

All that's left is to thank all of you for being there and for always supporting us, the fans.\"\n\nSpurs signed Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid and 19-year-old Brazilian defender Souza from Santos in the January window.\n\nThey added 18-year-old Hearts forward James Wilson on loan on transfer deadline day, but he will be part of their under-21s squad.\n\nIn response to Romero's post last month, manager Thomas Frank said the 27-year-old Argentina centre-back should keep some things \"internal\".\n\nTottenham wanted to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo in January but he joined Manchester City instead, with Frank saying on Friday the club \"did everything\" they could.\n\n\"The fans just want the best for the club, just like I, the owners, the staff, the players. Everyone wants the best for the club,\" added the Dane.\n\n\"But the transfer window is not Football Manager, unfortunately. It is not. It would be a lot easier, but also a little bit more boring.\"\n\nSpurs, who won the Europa League last term, are currently 14th in the Premier League and sit closer to the drop zone than the European qualification places, although they have made it to the last 16 of the Champions League.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): Ten men away at Aston Villa, I could have put the whole backline in. Keller has gone in and not only held his own as their number one, but continued to showcase probably why he left Liverpool. A lot of people would have said 'stay, Alisson is getting older, you'll get your chance'. He didn't, he went away and he has been fantastic for them and it is a team that suits him.\n\nMarcos Senesi (Bournemouth): Arguably one of the players of the season for me. He is really solid, goes about his business, gets everything done. Nothing is forced.\n\nGabriel (Arsenal): Leeds weren't poor, but Gabriel was solid and reassuring. He got the job done and knows the threat he poses from set-pieces. It was probably his best defensive display of the season.\n\nKristoffer Ajer (Brentford): Big, solid defender. He was celebrating making tackles in the first few minutes, which is not my cup of tea, but when you are doing it consistently all the way through and putting your body on the line, I'll give you a pass.\n\nEnzo Fernandez (Chelsea): Obviously he scored the goal that completed the great comeback. He gets a lot of stick, unjustifiably in my opinion. People don't think he's that good and maybe it's the price tag and because he won a World Cup that means they expect more. He is a good midfielder and a really good captain, and he looks after the ball when they are in difficult moments.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): I have been saying for weeks and months that with a player of that quality, it was only a matter of time before he settled into it. These past six weeks we have seen the real Florian Wirtz - dictating games, his passing range is unbelievable. The goals and assists have started to come now and he is looking really strong.\n\nAlex Scott (Bournemouth): It was a tough day for him because Wolves were decent. He has had a tough time after going away with England but has come back and has found his mojo. It's going to be an interesting back end of the season for him trying to make the World Cup squad.\n\nNoni Madueke (Arsenal): From thinking you are on the bench to finding out you are starting less than five minutes before kick-off is a massive turn of events. To be mentally focused to deliver, that is credit to Mikel Arteta and Madueke. They somehow gave the goal to him even though it was an own goal, but with a goal and assist he gets in the team.\n\nHabib Diarra (Sunderland): It says a goal and an own goal, but it's basically two goals for him. He was exceptional. The wide players absolutely killed Burnley and he was at the heart of it.\n\nDominic Solanke (Tottenham): It was probably the weirdest two goals he will score in his life. The first one is questionable but the second one is pure genius. To not only backheel it but to lob Gianluigi Donnarumma who is 6ft 6in is unbelievable. It is great to see him back playing. Can he have a late push now for the England squad? That is the question if he can stay fit.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Signing of the season? Probably. Another two goals and he looks like he is going from strength to strength, week by week. It's going to be really difficult for Alexander Isak to get back in.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a wonderful away performance at Elland Road. With Bukayo Saka getting injured in the warm-up there could have been excuses, but he didn't make any. He put Noni Madueke in and he returned the favour. It was a wonderful performance at a place where teams have struggled.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

Two, three and, in one case, four minutes.\n\nProfessional Match Game Officials (PMGO) insists that over the past couple of seasons VAR reviews are getting quicker.\n\nBut with extended stoppages, especially when they happen in clusters on one day, the fans' lived experience is very different.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there,\" Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"To wait that long is frustrating for everyone watching the game and I think everyone who loves football, generally, feels the frustration. But what can we do?\"\n\nA time limit on VAR checks and reviews has been suggested whenever there has been a day of interminable delays.\n\nBBC Sport understands that at no point has it been seriously considered by Fifa or the International Football Association Board (Ifab).\n\nBut could it actually work?

    "fullText": "When does the January transfer window close? Key dates for Premier League, European big five in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe January transfer window allows clubs across Europe to add mid-season reinforcements and make alterations as a reaction to their current positioning and squad health.\n\nSome clubs may wish to add players due to injuries, poor performance, or a strong first half of the campaign, which has positioned them to achieve more than they expected.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, may wish to move on from disgruntled players or get some cash for those who are slated to leave in the summer for free.\n\nThe Sporting News brings you a roundup of when the transfer window opens and closes across the major European leagues, who have come together in recent years to align their calendars with one another for a more streamlined process.\n\nMORE:Updated list of Premier League top goal scorers for 2025/26 season\n\nThe 2026 January transfer window closes for Premier League clubs onp.m. GMT (2 p.m. ET).\n\nThis is because the traditional closing date, January 31, falls on a Saturday, and as such it will close on the following Monday.\n\nLike the open date, the closing date is also matched for all of the major European leagues, meaning England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France's top flights all have the same closing date.\n\nThe only slight quirk is the time of day the window closes on. Serie A, Ligue 1, and the Bundesliga have synced with the Premier League perfectly, also closing at 7 p.m. GMT / 8 p.m. CET. However, the transfer window in Spain closes at 11:59 p.m. CET.\n\nThe January transfer window is a month-long period during which clubs can make changes to their roster.\n\nTechnically, a \"transfer window\" is actually a registration period, during which teams can register new players and make general changes to their league-official squad.\n\nPlayers acquired outside a transfer window cannot be registered until the new window opens.\n\nAdditionally, starting January 1, players who are out of contract in the summer are allowed to sign a pre-contract agreement with a new club, under certain circumstances (e.g. Premier League players can sign for a foreign team). They are still contracted to their current club through the end of the season, but they are able to sign agreements with a new team to take effect at the expiration of their current deal.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the intricacies of the handball rule in soccer",

    "fullText": "The transfer window closes tonight at 7pm after over a month of business across the Premier League.\n\nHowever, fans hoping to see late activity in the market at their clubs can keep the faith beyond 7pm.\n\nClubs are still allowed to strike deals after that time, provided they meet a specific rule that grants them a two-hour extension to finalise signings.\n\nA deal sheet is effectively a way for clubs to tell the Premier League that a transfer has been agreed – but they just need a bit more time to finalise the official documents.\n\nPremier League clubs can only use a deal sheet after 5pm, and it must be submitted before 7pm.\n\nIf all the relevant details are filled in, the Premier League grant an extra two hours for the deal to be completed.\n\nYou can see an example of a deal sheet below.\n\nArsenal signed Raheem Sterling using a deal sheet in summer 2024 – and once all media duties had been carried out, the Gunners ended up announcing the signing around 2am.\n\nHowever, this is only applicable to domestic transfers, and clubs must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight if they want to complete an international signing from abroad.\n\nThe Premier League describe the FIFA Transfer Matching System as follows.\n\n“When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on FIFA’s Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated.\n\n“The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details.\n\n“Our FA will request clearance and, as long as everything matches, the foreign association will issue clearance to the FA, who then informs the club and League.”\n\nIn years gone by, those in the English Football League (EFL) – meaning Championship, League One and League Two clubs – have also been allowed to submit a deal sheet for late transfers.\n\nHowever, the EFL have now put a stop to it.\n\nAn official statement reads: “In the EFL, all documentation must be provided prior to the deadline closing for the registration of a player to go through.”\n\nThere is – however – the presence of a ‘quick application’ which gives EFL clubs an extra 15 minutes to finalise transfers.\n\nIt is said: “If a club is in a Full Application at 10:30pm, they will receive a warning that states the system will open a Quick Application at 10:45pm, where only certain fields need to be completed.\n\n“In those last 15 minutes of the Transfer Window, EFL systems allow clubs to submit the necessary registration form without completing the full application process. Where they do this, the clubs then have a further 15 minutes to complete the full application process. This avoids clubs missing the deadline in circumstances where they have agreed and signed all necessary documents with another club and the player before 11pm, but still need time to complete the full application.”",

    "fullText": "Transfer deadline day has become an event for fans and something of a media circus in recent years, but it has always been an important day for managers, even before the current system of having transfer windows was introduced in 2002.\n\nGet it right - and get the player or players you want in at the 11th hour - and you can turn your season around.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't get important deals done or lose someone without replacing them, it can take the wind out of your sails and deflate a team involved in a promotion bid or survival battle.\n\nI never saw making late signings as a risk, because I always thought the players I was bringing in would make the team better.\n\nLooking back at the transfer deadline day deals I was involved in was really interesting. Yes, I had a few stinkers, but also some really good ones. A theme emerged which showed that if you can do good business, it can really change the fortunes of the team.\n\nAt Crystal Palace on the final day of the January window in 2014, for example, the permanent additions of Scott Dann, Wayne Hennessey, Joe Ledley and also Tom Ince on loan, sparked an amazing turnaround.\n\nWe were in a relegation battle and in serious trouble near the bottom of the Premier League when they arrived but we ended up 11th, 12 points clear of the bottom three, after securing our survival with three games to go.\n\nAll four new players were great positives who played a huge part in our improvement. I am not saying they upgraded the quality of our players but they gave us a better balance as a team, which I felt we lacked before they came in.\n\nGaining that balance enabled us to stay in the Premier League.",

    "fullText": "When the video assistant referee (VAR) stats are released at the end of the season, there will be a long list of correct interventions.\n\nThere will probably be three on the list from Sunday's Premier League matches.\n\nYet sometimes correct decisions come at a cost.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there,\" MOTD pundit Danny Murphy said of the VAR decisions.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\n\n\"I get VAR is here to stay and we are trying our best to embrace it but the time it is taking sometimes is too much.\n\n\"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone - most people would say that I think.\"\n\nIt took more than two minutes to cancel Manchester United's penalty against Fulham and change it to a free-kick.\n\nAlmost three and a half minutes were lost when the VAR ruled out a Fulham goal for offside.\n\nAston Villa's disallowed goal against Brentford only came about after a four-minute stoppage.\n\nIn contrast, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was left fuming after VAR quickly agreed with the onfield decision that Dominic Solanke hadn't fouled Marc Guehi for Tottenham's opener in the 2-2 draw.\n\nLong delays, mixed messages and irate managers have been the story of the day. As has been the case on too many occasions.\n\nAfter Sunday's incidents, many will agree with Murphy.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City take on Tottenham Hotspur today at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a crucial Premier League fixture. Pep Guardiola’s side will be eager to pick up three points to move back within four points of Premier League leaders Arsenal. Mikel Arteta’s side sits seven points clear of City after their win over Leeds United yesterday. City will take on a Tottenham side that has struggled in the Premier League this season. Thomas Frank’s side has flattered to deceive in terms of their performance in the league. But they did beat City earlier this season, so a tough test awaits Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nHere is the latest City injury news and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of today’s match.\n\nThere are a host of players who are unavailable for today’s match due to injury for Manchester City. Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, John Stones, Mateo Kovacic, Jeremy Doku and Savinho are all ruled out of today’s match. Pep Lijnders revealed that Doku is set to be ruled out for between two-three weeks due to the calf injury he sustained in City’s win over Galatasaray. Lijnders also revealed that Ruben Dias is set to return to training on Monday. Today’s match comes too soon for Manchester City’s defensive leader but his return from a hamstring injury is imminent.\n\nManchester City will be boosted by the returns of Rodri, Marc Guehi, and Antoine Semenyo. Rodri missed Manchester City’s win over Galatasaray due to suspension, but he is available for today’s pivotal match. Guehi and Semenyo were both ineligible to play in the Champions League, but both return today in a huge boost for Pep Guardiola’s side.",
