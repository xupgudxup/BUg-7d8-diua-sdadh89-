    "fullText": "Two Manchester United transfer targets, Yan Diomande and Elliot Anderson, are showcasing a shared dominant strength in the Bundesliga and the Premier League, respectively.\n\nManchester United’s top priority for midfield in 2026 is now clear, with Elliot Anderson taking the lead ahead of summer. His recent performance against Liverpool has only increased that focus.\n\nMeanwhile, Ineos are also searching for a left-sided winger, and there is growing interest in Yan Diomande.\n\nThe 19-year-old has been turning heads at RB Leipzig, and Amad Diallo’s relationship with him – built during their time together with Ivory Coast at AFCON – could play a role in any future move.\n\nUnited consider Diomande to be a player of rare potential, with his numbers from the Bundesliga supporting that view.\n\nDiomande has been a reliable playmaker for Leipzig this season, with eight goals and six assists in 22 league matches.\n\nBut it is his work without the ball that stands out even more. According to league data, no one in Germany’s top division has won more duels than the 19-year-old winger, who leads the way with 279 this campaign.\n\nDespite playing on the wing, he is ahead of Kaishu Sano by 28 duels. This highlights just how much he impacts games beyond his attacking numbers.\n\nHe is also one of the quickest players in the league, having clocked a top speed of 36.3km/h.\n\nGiven the current state of the Premier League, being able to handle the physical side of the game is a big deal for any new signings.\n\nDiomande’s ability to win duels, combined with his physical skills, shows he is more than ready to handle top-flight football in England.\n\nAnderson, United’s main midfield target, also stands out in this area. He leads the Premier League with 223 duels won so far in 2025/26.\n\nEverton’s James Tarkowski comes next with 177. For United, Patrick Dorgu leads their players with 140 duels won this season.\n\nIneos seem focused on adding players who can raise the team’s overall physical presence, and few fit that description better right now than Anderson and Diomande.\n\nMichael Carrick shares honest thoughts on Marcus Rashford leaving Man Utd for Barcelona\n\nWhy Man United legend Patrice Evra brutally slammed ‘delusional’ Arsenal fans",

    "fullText": "Police have confirmed they are investigating after four Premier League players experienced online racial abuse at the weekend.\n\nBurnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana both received racist abuse on Instagram after Saturday's 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.\n\nOn Sunday, Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare and Sunderland winger Romaine Mundle were also targeted for abuse on social media.\n\nThe UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) said on Monday it has \"launched a number of investigations\" after receiving four separate reports of online racial abuse.\n\n\"There is absolutely no place for racial abuse, either online or in person, and anyone who believes they can hide behind their keyboards should think again,\" said chief constable Mark Roberts, who is the head of the UKFPU.\n\n\"The UKFPU condemns this abhorrent behaviour and we will ensure that, through our dedicated team of officers, we do everything possible to identify those responsible and bring them to justice.\"\n\nAnti-discrimination group Kick It Out said reports of online abuse are at record levels, increasing by a third compared to the same point last season.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman also described the abuse as \"abhorrent\", adding: \"The Prime Minister has supported footballers before who have had the courage to come forward and call out discrimination and racism and this is no different.\n\n\"Premier League clubs have said they want to work with social media sites, including Meta, the Premier League and the police to identify those responsible.\n\n\"And Meta has said that it will continue to work to protect people from abuse. Ministers will be holding them to account to ensure it happens.\"\n\n'Appalling weekend' - Arokodare & Mundle latest players to be racially abused\n\nPolice investigate online abuse of Rangers duo\n\n'Educate yourself and your kids' - Fofana and Mejbri racially abused\n\nA police statement said: \"As the law enforcement lead for online abuse connected to football, the UKFPU will be working closely with all the football clubs and their players to help identify the people responsible.\n\n\"Over recent months the UKFPU have seen a number of successful prosecutions for online racial abuse, which have resulted in significant football banning orders.\n\n\"However, we recognise that there is always more to do, and we will continue to work closely with Ofcom, English football authorities, and social media platforms to tackle the issue.\"\n\nResponding to the Fofana and Mejbri abuse, a spokesperson for Meta, which owns platforms including Instagram, told BBC Sport: \"No-one should be subjected to racist abuse, and we remove this content when we find it.\n\n\"No one thing will stop racist behaviour overnight, but we'll continue working to protect our community from abuse and co-operate with police investigations.\"\n\nLast November, a BBC investigation found more than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend.\n\nThe season-opening Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth in August was stopped after then-Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.\n\nA man has denied the abuse and his trial is scheduled to take place in April.\n\nIn January, Newcastle United said they had contacted police after midfielder Joe Willock was the subject of \"disgusting\" racial abuse and \"deeply disturbing threats\" on social media.\n\nTottenham forward Mathys Tel was also the subject of racist abuse on social media after being one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain in August.\n\nEngland defender Jess Carter was another target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.\n\nAnd England internationals Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to racism in the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final, which the Three Lions lost to Italy in a penalty shootout.\n\nKick It Out said it had been an \"appalling weekend\" but stressed it was not a one-off situation, stating that \"the sad fact is, we know it happens regularly\".\n\nIt said there has been a 45% increase in the overall number of reports it has received online and across the game's professional and grassroots levels at this point in the season.\n\nOnline incidents accounted for the highest proportion of reports (38%), Kick It Out said.\n\nThe organisation's chief executive, Samuel Okafor, called on social media companies to take stronger action.\n\n\"They have the technical capabilities to be able to provide their platform so it is free from discrimination and they're choosing not to,\" Okafor said.\n\nMeta has previously said it has taken a number of steps to stop abuse taking place, including removing offensive comments.\n\nOkafor believes there is a clear explanation for why the number of cases has increased.\n\nHe said: \"I think it's fans not wanting to put up with it, it's players having the courage to call it out, and also an element of the political climate we're in, which is emboldening people to say things they wouldn't have said previously.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "After conceding another late goal on Saturday, we look at the stats that show Leeds would be ninth in the Premier League if games ended after 85 minutes.",
    "fullText": "Leeds United manager Daniel Farke described the 1-1 Premier League draw at third-placed Aston Villa as \"a valuable point\" for his \"warriors\" - but he must have been secretly seething at the concession of yet another costly late goal.\n\nTammy Abraham's leveller with two minutes of normal time to play at Villa Park on Saturday was the 12th league goal Leeds have let in from the 86th minute onwards this season.\n\nThat is the most goals shipped in that period of the game by any club in the top flight.\n\nWhile half of those last-gasp strikes have not affected Leeds' results, the other half have - meaning the Whites have dropped a league-high nine points at the death.\n\nIf every Premier League game had ended after 85 minutes this season, Leeds would be ninth in the table and in the hunt for European football.\n\nInstead, they are actually 15th - just six points above the relegation zone.\n\nThe most notable turnaround came last month when Farke's side snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in a seven-goal thriller at St James' Park.\n\nLeeds were 3-2 up when the clock struck 90 minutes before Newcastle scored twice in added time to win 4-3.\n\nThe first of those two goals was a 91st-minute Bruno Guimaraes penalty - the fourth spot-kick Leeds have given away in added time this term. Harvey Barnes then clinched it for Newcastle in the 102nd minute, the latest match-winning Premier League goal on record.\n\nThrow in a 94th-minute own goal from Gabriel Gudmundsson during September's visit to Fulham that gifted the Cottagers all three points, and the pattern does raise questions about Leeds' fitness and concentration in the latter stages.\n\n\"For me it can only be a concentration issue,\" says former Leeds and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson. \"I don't think it's down to fitness - two or three minutes at the end of the game is neither here nor there for these players.\n\n\"There are various types of goals in there - penalties, an own goal, others that are harder to legislate for. Any goal, if you break it down, you can pick out an error or a lapse of concentration somewhere along the chain. Maybe sometimes there's a lack of leadership in the dying minutes.\n\n\"The Leeds fans won't care as long as they stay up but, at the minute, they're drawing too many games and they're right in the mix.\"\n\nOf course, Leeds have also benefited from late goals this season too.\n\nAo Tanaka smashed home a 96th-minute equaliser against Liverpool at Elland Road in December, while Lukas Nmecha's fine volley in the 91st minute sealed all three points against Fulham last month.\n\nUltimately, Farke deserves credit for Leeds' turnaround in fortunes since switching to a 3-5-2 formation at half-time against Manchester City in late November - a game City won in the 91st minute through Phil Foden.\n\nA run of just two defeats in the subsequent 14 league games has moved Leeds out of the relegation zone.\n\nBut when Farke reflects on his side's late-goal problem, he might be left wondering: \"What if?\"",

    "fullText": "Former England striker Gary Lineker has just compared Chelsea’s Joao Pedro with Arsenal striker Kai Havertz.\n\nLineker has been reviewing the latest round of Premier League games on his Podcast this morning, and he has looked at what he believes to be some clear comparisons with Pedro and former Blues man, Kai Havertz.\n\nI am sure this is going to split opinions and also, many Chelsea fans will be left wondering whether it’s a good or a bad thing that one of our strikers is being compared with Havertz, because many Blues fans never even rated him when he was here!\n\nJoao Pedro looks on against Burnley. (Photo by Jasper Wax/Getty Images)\n\n‘Another goal for Joao Pedro at the weekend so let’s talk about signed strikers in the Premier League,’ Lineker said on The Rest is Football podcast.\n\n‘Isak, Ekitike, Pedro, Gyokeres and Sesko were the big ones weren’t they last summer. Ekitike has done really well and similar numbers but Pedro has perhaps gone slightly under the radar in terms of how well he’s done.\n\n‘I think he’s a very good footballer, he’s technically very gifted. I think he’s a really good player, he does remind me a little bit of Kai Havertz.\n\n‘They’re similar type of players, both very technically gifted and they both almost glide around the pitch. I think he’s a really good player.’\n\nChelsea are apparently looking to replace goalkeeper Robert Sanchez in the summer transfer window, with links coming in now with a new Premier League goalkeeper.\n\nPedro Neto got an assist at the weekend, but Chelsea’s attack in general disappointed as they failed to capitalise more on their periods of dominance against Burnley.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly now looking into a move to sign Sunderland’s 6ft 4in goalkeeper Robin Roefs this summer.\n\nIt’s a surprise link that has come from nowhere really, with the goalkeeper noise around Stamford Bridge going a little bit quiet lately.\n\nWith the form of Robert Sanchez improving immensely, we have seen new number one goalkeeper links with Chelsea die out a little bit. But there is another situation brewing up.\n\nFilip Jorgensen is basically not playing at all now at Chelsea and will clearly be looking to move on in the summer if his situation does not improve. He is a young goalkeeper who will not be happy playing as a backup – so you will see him looking to move on at the end of the season. And Chelsea will need to replace him.\n\nAgain though, will Roefs be happy being a backup, if that is what they are looking at him for, if they are even looking at him at all?\n\nThey are, according to one reliable journalist this week.\n\nChelsea are interested in signing Roefs ahead of the summer transfer window, with the North East club slapping a £50m price tag on his head, according to journalist Alan Nixon.\n\nThe big shock here though is that the report actually claims Roefs would be to replace SANCHEZ and NOT Jorgensen!?\n\nAccording to the report from Nixon, Chelsea are in the race to sign Sunderland goalkeeper Roefs ahead of the transfer window. The Blues are believed to be searching for a new number one, and Sunderland would be willing to do business if the price is right.\n\nNixon claims it could take an offer in the region of £50m for Chelsea to secure his signature, while Roefs would be keen on a move if Rosenior’s side seal Champions League qualification.\n\nI simply cannot see this right now, don’t think it will happen, at least not replacing Sanchez with him.",

    "fullText": "Everton host Manchester United at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday night, knowing this is a chance to reset the mood around their season.\n\nEverton started the weekend eighth in the Premier League table, firmly in the European conversation.\n\nStill, frustration is growing on Merseyside after six games without a win at home in all competitions. Another defeat under the lights would only worsen the unease.\n\nHowever, Everton have already beaten United once this season and will take confidence from that win when they welcome the resurgent Red Devils for this tantalising clash.\n\nEverton boss David Moyes returns to face his former club at a delicate time. The 2-1 home defeat to Bournemouth before the break was particularly galling.\n\nEverton were in control before eight chaotic minutes flipped the game. A chance to consolidate a European push slipped away.\n\nTheir home form is now a concern. They have lost five of their last nine Premier League matches on Merseyside, as many as in their previous 28.\n\nThe new 52,000-seat arena is yet to feel like a fortress.\n\nIn contrast, their away record has been excellent. It is the inconsistency at Hill Dickinson Stadium that is holding them back.\n\nMeanwhile, Man United arrive in very different spirits. Since Michael Carrick replaced Ruben Amorim, United have rediscovered rhythm and resilience.\n\nNo side has collected more points in 2026.\n\nA stoppage-time equaliser from Benjamin Sesko at West Ham United extended their unbeaten run and underlined a growing belief. United are playing with freedom again.\n\nEverton are looking to complete just their second Premier League double over Manchester United after 2013/14. But the Toffees must be wary.\n\nUnited have 19 away wins and 42 overall victories against Everton in the Premier League, more than any team has against another in the competition’s history.\n\nEverton have lost five of their last nine home league games (W2, D2) while United are unbeaten in their last nine top-flight matches (W5, D4), their longest such run since 2021.\n\nJake O’Brien is suspended following his red card against Bournemouth, forcing a reshuffle in defence.\n\nLong-term absentee Jack Grealish remains sidelined, but Seamus Coleman is back in contention and could return at right-back.\n\nMore likely, Moyes will roll with Scottish international (15-caps) Nathan Patterson at right-back. Tyrique George, 20, should retain his place in the attack.\n\nIdrissa Gueye is available despite his dismissal at Old Trafford, while Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall will be eager to haunt United again after scoring the winner in November.\n\nJordan Pickford; Nathan Patterson, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Idrissa Gueye, James Garner; Tyrique George, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Iliman Ndiaye; Thierno Barry.",

    "fullText": "For those who have followed Eberechi Eze's career, the sight of him wheeling away to celebrate an important goal towards the end of the season will not come as a surprise.\n\nTottenham Hotspur fans, though, will be happy not to come up against the Arsenal forward again until next season.\n\nEze has scored 40 Premier League goals in his six league seasons, with 19 coming from the 30th game onwards.\n\nBasically, the England international has a record of netting goals late in the campaign, when it matters most.\n\nEze, who scored the winning goal for Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final last season against Manchester City, has tormented Spurs since turning them down last summer to sign for the Gunners.\n\nHaving netted a hat-trick in the 4-1 north London derby win back in November, another two followed in Sunday's crucial encounter at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\n\"He had that belief and I'm really happy with him. He's really trying to mould and adapt into what we want from him,\" said boss Mikel Arteta.\n\nIronically, Eze's other league goal this season came against his former side Palace in a 1-0 win in October, which means all his league goals this term have come against those two teams.\n\nAnd after his brace in Arsenal's latest thumping of their rivals, only Robert Pires (seven) and Emmanuel Adebayor (six) have more Premier League goals for the Gunners against Tottenham than Eze's five.\n\nHe is also the first Arsenal player to score five or more goals against an opponent in the same top-flight season since Adebayor against Derby in 2007-08 (six).\n\nSupporters had already taken to the 27-year-old because of the way he signed for the club, turning down Spurs to join them instead in a £60m deal, but the goals he has scored are the icing on the cake.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nIt's been a difficult period for Eze, who has found minutes in the league hard to come by and this was was only his second start in the league since December.\n\nHe has a tough route into the team with captain Martin Odegaard a key part of Arteta's first-choice midfield when he is fit and Leandro Trossard being in good form on the left wing, which is the other position Eze might feature.\n\nThe Arsenal boss did trial Eze on the left, but he switched off when Matty Cash scored Aston Villa's opener in their 2-1 defeat in December and, despite starting the following game, he was left on the substitute's bench for the next four league matches.\n\nArteta opted to play England winger Bukayo Saka from the start in the disappointing 2-2 draw with Wolves in midweek as a number 10 - ahead of Eze, who started on the bench.\n\nAnd the Spaniard admitted: \"He was upset, even with me, because I didn't play him the other day from the beginning, and some of the decisions that I made. And I just have to understand how we're going to get the best out of him now.\"\n\nArteta was asked by BBC Sport whether Eze's record of producing goals at the end of the season was one of the reasons they signed him.\n\n\"We looked at every stat, but that one, to be very honest, no,\" he added while laughing.\n\n\"He scored five goals in the last few games against them, which is extremely difficult to do. But I could see that he wanted to prove something.\"\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was in attendance at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Eze will have hoped to have caught his eye after a recent lack of game time to boost his World Cup hopes this summer.\n\n\"Today it's worked out, we thank God for it,\" Eze told Sky Sports. \"We put in a good performance. We did what we needed to do, which was the main thing.\n\n\"I'm always trying to get in those positions to be ready and to find the space and to work hard to get those opportunities. It takes a lot to get there and it's worked out today.\"\n\nIt was also an important day for Eze's team-mate Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nThe Swedish international has been criticised at times this season for his performances but since the turn of the year has started to find some form.\n\nAnd after a double himself at Spurs, no Premier League player has scored more goals in 2026 across all competitions than Gyokeres with eight of his 15 for his club coming in this calendar year.\n\nThe 27-year-old linked up with Eze and played a big part in Arsenal's third goal, while he seemed to visibly grow in confidence after scoring.\n\n\"For me, the best, the most complete, and especially when we need him most and that is when big players and big clubs have to stand up when you are needed,\" added Arteta when asked about his £64m summer signing from Sporting.\n\nArsenal are now five points clear of Manchester City, although they have played one more game and visit Pep Guardiola's men at Etihad Stadium in April - and Eze and Gyokeres look like they are starting to find the net at just the right time.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Arsenal passed the north London derby test with flying colours as Premier League title race looks likely to go to the wire, says chief football writer Phil McNulty",
    "fullText": "Arsenal answered questions posed about their nerve under pressure in the most emphatic fashion in the north London derby to suggest this is a Premier League race that will go down to the wire.\n\nThe manner in which Mikel Arteta's side collapsed in losing a two-goal lead at doomed Wolverhampton Wanderers saw old uncertainties and past pain resurface as hunters Manchester City scented blood.\n\nIt made the meeting with arch-rivals Spurs even more hazardous, especially with the toxic air around this dysfunctional club partly cleared by the sacking of unpopular head coach Thomas Frank and his replacement by Igor Tudor.\n\nArsenal need not have worried as, even with the imposing figure of the giant Croatian prowling his technical area clad in black, they were the beneficiaries of the latest cure prescribed by \"Dr. Tottenham\", always on hand to provide help to any opponent in times of strife.\n\nThe Spurs stadium announcer attempted to rally the crowd with a growled pre-match message delivered at ear-splitting volume, bellowing: \"They are worried. They are nervous as hell. We are calm. We are ready. The fire is ready to be lit.\"\n\nSadly for Spurs, the final score on that one was zero out of five.\n\nArsenal were the furthest thing from \"nervous as hell.\" Spurs were the furthest thing from calm and ready. No fires lit here.\n\nSpurs were almost cruelly outclassed as Arsenal's advantage at the top of the table returned to five points, although Pep Guardiola's City have a game in hand.\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTo sum up this latest Premier League weekend, Manchester City threw down the gauntlet by closing the gap to two points with a tension-filled win against Newcastle United. Arsenal picked it up with relish in this thumping 4-1 win.\n\nIt means that even before the end of February, sights are starting to turn to what might just be a title decider between City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on 18 April.\n\nIn the interim, Arsenal have home games against Chelsea, Everton and Bournemouth, along with a visit to Brighton. City travel to Leeds United, West Ham and Chelsea, with relegation strugglers Nottingham Forest to come to the Etihad.\n\nAnd, of course, there might just be a psychological blow to be struck when Arsenal and City meet in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday 22 March.\n\nArsenal are now 10 games from the glory that has eluded them since Arsene Wenger's \"Invincibles\" in 2003-04. Destiny is their hands. The twist in the tale is that the same applies to Manchester City.\n\nFor all Arsenal might have wished to play down the significance of this single game in the title context, it was a win and performance they needed desperately to calm concerns on and off the pitch.\n\nAnd this was a consummate display, cool and measured with a ruthless edge, even if it came against this dreadfully poor Spurs side.\n\nEberechi Eze picked the perfect time to return to his best, playing his part as derby tormentor again with two goals to add to the three he got in the 4-1 win at Emirates Stadium in December.\n\nSince that hat-trick, Eze had featured in all 15 of Arsenal's subsequent league games, but had made only four starts and played just 360 minutes before this derby.\n\nIn his last start he was substituted at half-time against Brentford, so credit to Arteta for having the instinct to feel that this was the sort of occasion to suit him, deploying him in the \"number 10\" role against the club who thought they had signed him until Arsenal stepped in to clinch a £60m deal with Crystal Palace.\n\nAnd there was more good news with much-criticised striker Viktor Gyokeres also scoring two fine goals on a perfect day for the Gunners and their ecstatic fanbase.\n\nArsenal were not knocked out of their stride, even after Randal Kolo Muani's bustling equaliser for Spurs two minutes after Eze struck the first blow. This was a confident, reassuring performance.\n\nArteta told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"This was outstanding. I think you have to bring context to the situation and this is the beauty of football.\n\n\"You go to Wolves and you drop two points in the last kick of the match. Watching it back, there is no understanding from my perception how the hell that happened.\n\n\"It feels like the end of the world, but then you have another opportunity and that is the beauty of it. In a difficult stadium, against our rivals, and seeing how much it means to us in the league and all our supporters.\"\n\nHe added: \"This chapter we wanted to write. We have managed it.\"\n\nBBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy expects the race between the two to go right to the finishing line.\n\nHe said: \"The title race is still on massively for both. It's in both their hands, that's unusual. Normally it's in one team's hands and you are just waiting for them to slip up.\n\n\"I have been very much in the Arsenal camp in terms of my eyes telling me they are the best team. The last couple of results have given Man City that little bit of hope. They have a lot of players in the squad who have been there and done it.\n\n\"Speaking from experience, when you have got over the line, the next couple feel easier. Every time Arsenal go on the pitch the pressure is on at the minute. It's great for us and I hope it goes to the wire. I don't see any winning all games from now until the end of the season.\"\n\nArsenal's nerve was put the test. They passed - and more tests will come for the Gunners and Manchester City as the Premier League pursuit reaches its climax.\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team",

    "fullText": "Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare and Sunderland winger Romaine Mundle have become the latest Premier League players to be sent racist abuse on social media on an \"appalling weekend\" when four footballers from the top tier of the English game were targeted.\n\nArokodare and Mundle detailed their experiences on Sunday, a day after Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana both received racist abuse on Instagram after their sides drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\"This has been an appalling weekend after four players called out the racist abuse they've received on social media,\" anti-discrimination group Kick It Out said on Sunday evening. \"But the sad fact is, we know it happens regularly.\n\n\"The message from them is loud and clear: action must follow. Players cannot be expected to tolerate this behaviour, and nor should anyone else.\"\n\nWolves said they were \"disgusted\" after Arokodare was sent abuse by \"multiple perpetrators\" following his side's 1-0 loss at Crystal Palace and they condemned the \"abhorrent and unlawful behaviour in the strongest possible terms\".\n\nBoth the Nigeria international and Wolves shared a number of screenshots of private messages the 25-year-old received after the game in which he had a first-half penalty saved, before Evann Guessand scored an injury-time Palace winner.\n\n\"It's still unbelievable to me that we're playing in a time where people have so much freedom to communicate such racism without any consequences,\" wrote Arokodare on his Instagram story.\n\n\"These individuals should have no place in our game and collectively we have to take action to punish everyone who taints the sport like this, no matter who they are.\"\n\nIn a statement, Wolves added: \"Tolu has our full and unwavering support. No player should be subjected to such hatred simply for doing their job.\n\n\"We stand firmly alongside him, and alongside all footballers who are forced to endure this abuse from anonymous accounts acting with apparent impunity.\n\nSunderland said they are \"appalled by the vile\" abuse Mundle received after his substitute appearance in the 3-1 home defeat by Fulham.\n\nThey said: \"The abhorrent behaviour displayed by multiple individuals is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the club under any circumstances.\n\n\"These individuals do not represent Sunderland AFC, our values, or our community - and they are not welcome on Wearside.\"\n\nThe Sunderland Echo reported the 22-year-old English forward has since deleted his Instagram account.\n\nIn February 2025 while playing in the Championship for the Black Cats, Mundle shared a discriminatory post sent to him on his Instagram account.\n\nWolves and Sunderland said they are working with the relevant authorities and online platforms to identify those responsible.\n\nThe Premier League condemned the abuse and said there are \"serious consequences for anybody found guilty of discrimination and we will offer our full support with their investigations\", which can include club bans and legal prosecution.\n\nOn Saturday, Frenchman Fofana wrote: \"2026, it's still the same thing, nothing changes. These people are never punished.\n\n\"You create big campaigns against racism, but nobody actually does anything.\"\n\nTunisia international Mejbri, 23, called on people to \"educate yourself and your kids\".\n\nThese latest incidences of racist abuse towards players follow the alleged racial abuse of Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr during last week's Champions League knockout round play-off tie at Benfica, which Uefa is investigating.\n\nIn a statement earlier on Sunday, Kick It Out said: \"Players are standing up to discrimination, and we've had record reports to Kick It Out from across football this season, but we recognise the frustration in how it continues to fester online.\n\n\"Words matter, but actions are more important. Football is working together to tackle this issue alongside the UK Football Policing Unit and Ofcom, but social media companies must do more to offer protections to players and help improve accountability when incidents occur.\n\n\"Those who face this disgusting abuse must always be the priority.\"\n\nResponding to the Fofana and Mejbri abuse, a spokesperson for Meta told BBC Sport: \"No-one should be subjected to racist abuse, and we remove this content when we find it.\n\n\"No one thing will stop racist behaviour overnight, but we'll continue working to protect our community from abuse and co-operate with police investigations.\"\n\nLast November, a BBC investigation found more than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend.\n\nThe season-opening Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth last August was stopped in the first half after then-Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.\n\nA Liverpool man has denied the abuse and his trial is scheduled to take place in April.\n\nIn January, Newcastle United said they had contacted the police after midfielder Joe Willock was the subject of \"disgusting\" racial abuse and \"deeply disturbing threats\" on social media.\n\nTottenham forward Mathys Tel was also the subject of racist abuse on social media after being one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain in August.\n\nEngland defender Jess Carter was another target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.\n\nAnd England internationals Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to racism in the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final, which the Three Lions lost to Italy in a penalty shootout.\n\nLatest Wolves news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Wolves - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "A resurgent Manchester United have the chance to add to Everton's poor recent home form in the final fixture of the Premier League weekend on Monday at Hill Dickinson Stadium (20:00 GMT).\n\nHaving been eliminated from the FA Cup in the third round, both sides have had nearly a fortnight to reflect on their previous results in the top flight.\n\nEverton were undone by eight minutes of chaos at home to Bournemouth to lose 2-1, while United salvaged a point at West Ham United in stoppage time.\n\nEverton are in a curious position at the moment. After numerous seasons of flirting with relegation, the table looks a lot rosier - they started the weekend in eighth position - yet there is still some frustration around recent performances at home.\n\nThe calamitous manner in which they threw away a winning position against Bournemouth left supporters angry, as a chance to consolidate a spot in the European positions was tossed away.\n\nIt's now six games without a win at Hill Dickinson Stadium in all competitions; they have lost five of their last nine Premier League home games, as many as they had in their previous 28.\n\nThat run is in stark contrast to the team's away form; they've won five, drawn four and lost one of their last nine.\n\nManager David Moyes will be hoping a visit from a big-name opponent can ignite the mood at the new 52,000-seat arena. The number of midweek games and Monday night matches have been a big factor in a number of low-key atmospheres at their new home.\n\nUnited have 19 away wins and 42 wins overall against Everton in the Premier League, more than any team has against another team in the competition's history.\n\nThe Toffees did get the better of the Red Devils previously though, as they rallied from an early Idrissa Gueye red card to win 1-0 at Old Trafford thanks to a Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall goal. A win for Everton on Monday would give them just their second Premier League double over United, the first coming in 2013-14 when Moyes was in charge of the Red Devils.\n\nThat defeat in November was arguably the nadir for former boss Ruben Amorim. Plenty has changed since, with Michael Carrick in charge and the team playing with a renewed sense of freedom.\n\nThe draw at West Ham may have ended Carrick's winning start, but the team will take heart from the manner in which they fought to the end.\n\nBenjamin Sesko's stoppage-time goal - his second in three games - was enough to extend the team's current unbeaten streak to nine. The improved form of the £74m summer transfer will be a big relief at Old Trafford.\n\nOverall, United have been the best team in the division in 2026, with no side able to better their haul of 15 Premier League points for the year; they have also scored more open play goals than any team since Carrick took charge.\n\nAgainst a muddled opponent - their favourite opponent - they will be confident of adding to that on Merseyside.",

    "description": "Man City 2-1 Newcastle: Pep Guardiola’s men closed the gap on Premier League leaders Arsenal to just two points with victory at the Etihad",
    "fullText": "When Manchester City won at Anfield, Pep Guardiola declared that all his side could do was breathe down the neck of Arsenal. And if the Premier League leaders are feeling ever more uncomfortable, it is because they can sense their pursuers are ever closer.\n\nThe margin is two points now, giving Arsenal all the more reason to rue the two they dropped at Molineux, all the more pressure in Sunday’s North London derby. City are acquiring the momentum Arsenal seem to have mislaid.\n\nAnd, after Arsenal capitulated at Wolves, City had a player who grasped the opportunity. They have spent around £430m in the last three transfer windows but their catalyst cost nothing. Three midfielders Guardiola has signed in the last 14 months began on the bench, in Nico Gonzalez, Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki, while the homegrown Nico O’Reilly started and delivered his first Premier League brace. Strange as it sounds, he is level for goals in 2026 with Erling Haaland. This was the sort of display that, if City become champions, may be bracketed with some of Yaya Toure’s goalscoring displays in past glories.\n\nThe life of O’Reilly may yet involve a trip to the World Cup. The life of Guardiola can involve reinventing and reimagining footballers. O’Reilly, a No 10 in his younger days, became a talismanic makeshift left-back. Now he has been recast as a marauding midfielder. “He played full-back, holding midfielder, he can play now in his position,” reflected Guardiola. “What a player. He makes an incredible step. Nico give us in the middle that physicality that we need.”\n\nMeanwhile, Haaland and Omar Marmoush, the split strikers and supposed scorers, became O’Reilly’s suppliers, each registering an assist. The Mancunian’s double showed different sides to his game; for the first, he arrowed in a shot from 18 yards after powering forward to meet Marmoush’s pass; the Egyptian may have been selected as a specialist for such a fixture, given his record of scoring against Newcastle, but instead helped make a goal.\n\nO’Reilly’s second felt the kind Haaland should be scoring. Instead, the Norwegian lofted the cross to the far post and the local lad met it with a towering header. “The assist from Erling was unbelievable,” added Guardiola. Haaland will almost certainly end the season with his third Premier League Golden Boot but now only Bruno Fernandes has more assists in the current campaign.\n\nAntoine Semenyo and Marmoush might have got a third for City while Nick Pope made a 91st-minute double save from Haaland and Phil Foden. None struck, which meant Gianluigi Donnarumma’s terrific 94th-minute stop was needed to deny Harvey Barnes and secure the points.\n\nYet, amid the tension, there was a predictability to the outcome. City’s fifth straight win in all competitions was a third over Newcastle in 2026. There may be a fourth when they meet in the FA Cup in two weeks. As Newcastle’s last point at the Etihad came in 2006, an extraordinarily unsuccessful run was extended. Nevertheless, they threatened to end it.\n\nAt least a 17th straight reverse brought a first top-flight goal here since 2018 and in Eddie Howe’s reign. Lewis Hall squeezed a shot through a crowded box, aided by a deflection off Rodri. It was a landmark goal for the left-back, too; his first in 21 months.\n\nWhen Newcastle pulled level, City restored their lead inside five minutes. That was an immediate riposte and City’s swift start had suggested they were intent on making a point. They played at a blistering pace. Newcastle struggled in the first half and rallied thereafter. “You have to take into account the game in midweek and the travel,” said Howe, who fielded 10 of the side who started against Qarabag in Azerbaijan three days earlier. “It was a good effort by the lads physically.”\n\nHowe rued the defensive errors for the two goals. Newcastle might have scored two of their own. Dan Burn headed in Sandro Tonali’s free kick and had begun celebrating before he was flagged. It seemed he was pushed into an offside position by Ruben Dias, though Howe did not complain.\n\nNewcastle had another threat, even when under the cosh: Anthony Gordon’s pace on the break rendered him a menace. He drew a fine save from Donnarumma after motoring past Marc Guehi. When he was accelerating beyond Dias, the defender tugged him back, at a cost of a caution. He went off at half-time, the faster Abdukodir Khusanov replacing him. Gordon was less of a threat thereafter. Guardiola’s change worked.\n\nSo City left the field to cheers. They entered it to a guard of honour from their 1976 League Cup winners, who beat Newcastle in the final and secured the club’s last major trophy for 35 years. It felt as if it should have been the other way around, the current players forming the guard for their predecessors.\n\nThis new-look City side have not won much together. “Seventy per cent of the players have never been in that situation,” noted Guardiola. But perhaps they appear better equipped to cope with it than Arsenal.",

    "fullText": "Seven years after firing them into the Premier League, Tammy Abraham is back scoring goals at Aston Villa to keep their fans and manager dreaming of glory.\n\nWith Villa on the verge of losing 1-0 to Leeds United on Saturday, substitute Abraham, who had only been on the pitch for 13 minutes, guided the ball with his knee into the net to score an 88th-minute equaliser.\n\nIt was the 28-year-old's second goal since returning to the club following his £18.2m move from Besiktas in January, after scoring in the 3-1 loss to Newcastle in the FA Cup seven days ago.\n\nBut scoring for Villa is nothing new for the 11-time England international. He netted 25 times in 37 Championship games to help the club win promotion in 2018-19 during a loan spell from Chelsea.\n\nAfter his original time with Villa, Abraham had two seasons at Chelsea, three at Roma, one on loan at AC Milan and then another loan spell at Besiktas, with the Turkish club buying him to then immediately sell him to Villa for a profit.\n\n\"It feels like a dream to come back and play for this club again,\" said Abraham. \"I'm happy to be here and bring extra energy.\n\n\"I had to sniff around the box, be alert, be ready. Luckily for us, I got the goal - it was in front of some of the best supporters in the world.\"\n\nAbraham equaliser earns draw for Villa against Leeds\n\nDespite the late equaliser, third-placed Villa have now dropped seven points from their past four matches and sit seven points adrift of leaders Arsenal with 11 games to go.\n\nAsked whether the Villa squad feel like they are title contenders, Abraham said: \"Who knows what can happen? We are not too far from Arsenal who are at the top. Unfortunately today we didn't get the win but we just have to keep pushing.\n\n\"When I first arrived I spoke with a few of the boys, and watching from afar you can see that the team has a lot of qualities. We're delighted to be where we are today but we are so close, so we have to just keep pushing and keep believing in ourselves.\n\n\"I'm happy to be back home. I just need to find myself a house!\"\n\nEven though Arsenal have drawn back-to-back games, it is hard to see them or second-placed Manchester City dropping enough points for Villa to take advantage and become English champions for the first time since 1981.\n\nBoss Unai Emery has consistently talked down his side's chances of winning the league, last month saying even a top-five position could be beyond them.\n\nHe was quick to remind the supporters, some of whom booed the team off at half-time when they were trailing 1-0 on Saturday, that they were still enjoying a fantastic campaign.\n\n\"We are at a beautiful and fantastic moment to compete in two competitions for the remainder of the season,\" he said. \"It is the moment to show our wishes and follow our dreams.\n\n\"We have a great opportunity to achieve our objectives and dream of big things. Our position in the table is enviable and we all would have signed up for it before the season began.\n\n\"The Premier League is very difficult for us, but we are third - and that's very good. Our priority is to focus on every match. We're third with 51 points and the next step is Wolves [on Friday].\n\n\"We're setting our standards high and sometimes you can get frustrated, but overall our consistency is still there and we're third because of that consistency.\"\n\nAbraham, who received a great reception from the club's fans when he came on, played alongside Ollie Watkins, instead of replacing him.\n\nEmery said that was a tactic he would do again in the right circumstances, with Abraham also relishing the competition for a place.\n\n\"We spoke about it [playing together] a few times in training, and luckily we were able to grab the goal so the gaffer can see that it can work,\" added Abraham.\n\n\"We know he is a top striker and he has been here for a few years and scored many goals, so it is fantastic competition to have.\"\n\nEmery was full of praise for the new recruit and added: \"He left the Premier League seven years ago and now he is adapting in everything we're demanding.\n\n\"It's a huge commitment from him to try to help us with his qualities, and he showed it because he played 20 minutes and he was motivated, excited and scored from it.\"\n\nLatest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Aston Villa - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Chelsea have more red cards than any side in the Premier League this season, and boss Liam Rosenior says they have \"set fire\" to points.",
    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior has inherited many of the problems that afflicted Enzo Maresca's side before him.\n\nAfter Burnley's 93rd‑minute equaliser in their 1-1 draw, Chelsea became the Premier League leaders for dropping points at home - 17 this season.\n\nThey also now have a league‑high six red cards this term, following Wesley Fofana's dismissal in the 72nd minute.\n\nThat red card ultimately led to Chelsea's subsequent collapse after Joao Pedro opened the scoring, with Rosenior lamenting that his side have \"set fire to four points\" after drawing 2-2 at home to Leeds in their previous league match.\n\n\"There's an inquest after every game whether we win or lose,\" Rosenior added.\n\nHowever, this is the first result to prompt such an angry reaction from the manager, who was appointed after Maresca left the club on New Year's Day following a falling-out with the hierarchy.\n\nRosenior continued: \"I'm learning about the players. I'm learning about the people you can lean on when things aren't going your way and you need to see a game out. That's something we need to address very quickly.\"\n\nThere was further frustration over goalscorer Zian Flemming being given a free header in the centre of Chelsea's box, with Burnley substitute Jacob Bruun Larsen missing a similar chance minutes later.\n\n\"A marking assignment was missed,\" Rosenior said. \"I'm not here to throw players under the bus - I will always protect my players, and I'll deal with it during the week.\n\n\"But there was a player assigned that duty who marked the wrong man.\"\n\nChelsea have equalled their highest number of red cards in a single Premier League season, matching the 2007‑08 campaign - but with 11 games still to play.\n\nOnly away at Nottingham Forest have Chelsea claimed all three points after going down to 10 men, holding on following an 87th‑minute dismissal.\n\nDefeats against Manchester United, Brighton and Fulham can largely be attributed to red cards earlier in those matches, while Chelsea rallied well after Moises Caicedo was sent off in the home draw with Arsenal in November.\n\nThe pattern is clear - Chelsea are suffering because of their lack of discipline. They are also a team accustomed to collecting yellow cards.\n\nThey sit bottom of the Fair Play table with 86 points, having received 60 yellow cards this season. They were second-bottom last season and bottom the season before.\n\nIt is hard not to link the disciplinary record to the age profile of the squad. Chelsea have not fielded a player over the age of 28 all season and have the youngest squad in the Premier League - a profile deliberately built by the club's hierarchy.\n\nHowever, Rosenior does not \n\n\"I think youth is one thing, accountability is another,\" he said. \"I'm accountable. I'm the head coach, I'm the manager of the team. I'm responsible for every result and every performance we have. We need players you can rely on in the moment to do their job.\n\n\"I know what we need to get there. It's not down to youth, it's down to assessing the players and identifying the ones you can rely on in difficult moments.\"\n\nRosenior also refused to single out Fofana and pointed out that the majority of red cards this season came before his appointment. Maresca himself was sent off for celebrating a last‑minute winner against Liverpool.\n\n\"Our discipline since I've come in - which is what I can speak about - has been very good,\" added Rosenior.\n\nChelsea have dropped a league‑high 17 points from winning positions at home and 19 in total - the second‑worst record in the Premier League behind West Ham on 20.\n\nIt is another area affected not only by red cards but also by an inability to finish teams off and defensive lapses, particularly from set-pieces.\n\nChelsea have conceded a league‑high 13.54 expected goals from set-pieces this season, resulting in 11 goals against.\n\nIt is unsurprising, therefore, that the combination of dead‑ball specialist Ward‑Prowse and an aerial presence such as Flemming contributed to the equaliser.\n\n\"Set plays are massive in the Premier League, they're so important. Our record this season, defending set plays, is not at the level required for us to achieve what we want to achieve, and that's something I need to address,\" Rosenior said.\n\nThere may also be a broader mentality issue, which again could be linked to the youthfulness of the squad - particularly within Chelsea's leadership group.\n\nAsked whether Chelsea have enough leaders, Rosenior simply replied \"Yes\", before adding: \"I think there are certain values you need to have in your team.\n\n\"The best teams, the teams that win titles - which is where we want to get to - win games 1-0 when they probably haven't played at their best.\n\n\"That should have been at least a 1-0 today. Even with 10 men for 25 minutes, that should have been a 1-0 at the least. I know what we need to get there. It's not down to youth, it's about assessing the players and identifying the ones you can rely on in difficult moments.\"\n\nChelsea were booed off at full‑time, and Rosenior's reaction may signal the end of a brief period of calm around Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt remains a promising start for the Englishman in his 11 games in charge, but he walked into a club already experiencing a febrile atmosphere, with anti‑ownership chants growing louder and fringe protests beginning to move into the mainstream.\n\nIt promises to be an interesting few weeks for Chelsea, with Arsenal, Aston Villa and Newcastle to come in a tougher run of Premier League fixtures.\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana have spoken out on social media after both were sent racist abuse following the clubs' Premier League match on Saturday.\n\nChelsea's French defender Fofana, who was sent off for a second yellow card in the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, shared several screenshots of private messages he received on Instagram after the game.\n\nHe then posted a message which read: \"2026, it's still the same thing, nothing changes. These people are never punished.\n\n\"You create big campaigns against racism, but nobody actually does anything.\"\n\nEarlier Burnley's Tunisia international Mejbri shared an image of an offensive message on Instagram and in another post wrote: \"It's 2026 and there are still people like that. Educate yourself and your kids, please.\"\n\nChelsea said they were \"appalled and disgusted\" by the \"vile\" abuse, saying it was \"abhorrent and will not be tolerated\".\n\nIn a statement they added: \"Such behaviour is completely unacceptable and runs counter to the values of the game and everything we stand for as a club. There is no room for racism.\n\n\"We stand unequivocally with Wes. He has our full support, as do all our players who are too often forced to endure this hatred simply for doing their job. We will work with the relevant authorities and platforms in identifying the perpetrators and take the strongest possible action.\"\n\nBurnley said they were \"disgusted\" by the abuse, adding in a statement: \"The club has reported the post to Instagram's parent company, Meta, and expects strong support from them, together with the Premier League and the police, and will work to ensure that the individual responsible is identified and investigated.\n\n\"There is no place for this in our society and we condemn it unreservedly.\n\n\"The club continues to be unequivocal in its stance – we have a zero-tolerance approach to any form of discrimination.\n\n\"Hannibal will receive the full backing from the club and from the Burnley fans, who we have already seen condemning the abuse. There is no room for racism.\"\n\nThe Premier League has condemned the abuse and said \"any individuals identified and found guilty of discrimination will face the strongest possible consequences, including club bans and legal prosecution\".\n\nThey are the latest incidences of racist abuse towards players this season and come days after the alleged racial abuse of Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr during a Champions League match against Benfica, which Uefa is investigating.\n\nLast November, a BBC investigation found that more than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend.\n\nIn August, the season opening Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth was stopped in the first half after then Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.\n\nA Liverpool man has denied the abuse and his trial is scheduled to take place in April.\n\nIn January, Newcastle United said they had contacted the police after midfielder Joe Willock was the subject of \"disgusting\" racial abuse and \"deeply disturbing threats\" on social media.\n\nTottenham forward Mathys Tel was the subject of racist abuse on social media after being one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain in August.\n\nEngland defender Jess Carter was also the target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.\n\nAnd England internationals Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to racism in the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final.\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Meta for a response.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "James Milner has broken the Premier League appearance record, 24 years after making his debut as a 16-year-old.",
    "fullText": "\"People joke that I only did it because he didn't do his homework,\" says former Premier League referee Jon Moss about the time he sent off James Milner.\n\nTwenty-four years after making his debut, Milner, 40, broke the record for most Premier League appearances when he started for Brighton at Brentford on Saturday.\n\nA stellar career spanning more than two decades, six top-flight clubs, 654 Premier League appearances, 61 England caps, three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and one Champions League triumph has also delivered some unexpected moments.\n\nLike the time Milner - known as 'Milly' by those close to him - was sent off by Moss, his former teacher at Westbrook Lane Primary School in Horsforth, Leeds, while playing for Liverpool against Crystal Palace in 2019.\n\n\"He said I couldn't wait to get my card out,\" laughs Moss about dismissing his former pupil after switching careers.\n\n\"People say I'm the only teacher to send off one of his pupils in a Premier League game. We can both laugh about it now.\"\n\nMilner has now overtaken Gareth Barry, who played 653 times, at the top of the all-time Premier League appearance list, some 8,504 days after making his debut for hometown club Leeds United soon after leaving school in 2002.\n\n\"I think that will be a special thing for him but he is focused on top of that on the ambitions from the club as well. He wants to be always successful like he was his whole life,\" said Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler.\n\n\"He is a driver of this winning mentality and I think it's very important to have these kind of players in the squad.\n\n\"They know how to win, they know what it needs to win, how you need to prepare a game, how you react in bad phases like on bad runs we have at the moment.\"\n\nAlan Shearer, who played with Milner at Newcastle, describes him as a model professional and a \"manager's dream\".\n\n\"You would do well if you had him in your squad because you knew exactly what you were going to get,\" adds former England captain Shearer.\n\nThis is the story about a young lad from Leeds who evolved to set standards for hard work, professionalism and longevity - and earn respect from fans all over the world.\n\nMilner was just 16 and earning £70 a week as a YTS player when he broke into the first team at Leeds, six months after taking his GCSE exams.\n\nOn 10 November 2002, his dad Peter was in the away end at Upton Park when boss Terry Venables sent the youngster on for Jason Wilcox, now director of football at Manchester United, in the final minutes of a 4-3 win against West Ham.\n\nIt was a dream come true for Milner, who had grown up supporting the club and wore shirts with the names of Tony Yeboah and Tony Dorigo on the back.\n\nSix weeks after the West Ham game, Milner - aged 16 years and 356 days - became the youngest Premier League goalscorer at that time when he scored in a 2-1 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.\n\nIt was not enough to get the former Leeds season ticket-holder out of his post-match duties, however.\n\nBack then YTS players were expected to clean the dressing room after first-team games.\n\n\"Even when I was playing and scoring goals, after games I was helping the kit man pick dirty shirts off the dressing room floor,\" Milner told the High Performance podcast in 2023.\n\n\"I carried on cleaning the under-18 captain's boots. I was playing in the first team but he was still older than me.\"\n\nIt was not long, however, before Milner was sent on loan to the third tier of English football to continue his football education.\n\nSome 17-year-olds might have sulked at the prospect of swapping the glamour of the Premier League for games against Grimsby and Peterborough.\n\nMilner saw it as a chance to show what he was all about.\n\nDid Milner's record become a problem for Brighton?\n\nCan you name the players with most Premier League appearances?\n\nDuring four weeks in Wiltshire, Milner played six games and scored two goals.\n\nSam Parkin, who was at Swindon at the same time as Milner, remembers a committed and hard-working teenager eager to learn.\n\n\"James was determined, driven and focused compared to some of the other young lads we had from Premier League clubs,\" recalls Parkin.\n\n\"He made a goal for me against Brighton at the Withdean Stadium and I remember us both scoring in a win against Peterborough.\"\n\nMilner describes his time in the lower leagues as a \"bit of an eye-opener\", with Swindon's players bringing their own pasta to eat on the team bus.\n\nYet he impressed with his attitude and performances, says Parkin.\n\n\"Before James went back to Leeds I told him: 'I never want to see you back here because you've got too much quality for this level',\" he adds.\n\nMilner returned to Elland Road where he became a first-team regular alongside the likes of Mark Viduka and Alan Smith.\n\nHe 'celebrated' his 18th birthday by playing in a 4-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal before relegation at the end of the 2003-04 season resulted in Leeds selling players to raise money.\n\nEngland forward Smith moved to Manchester United in a deal worth £7m, goalkeeper Paul Robinson went to Tottenham for £1.5m, while Milner signed for Newcastle in a deal worth £5m.\n\nNewcastle had just finished fifth in the Premier League, Sir Bobby Robson was manager and Shearer wore the captain's armband.\n\nIt was at Newcastle, however, that Milner would go on to experience one of the lowest moments of his career.\n\nShearer remembers Milner having a desire to learn and improve.\n\n\"He had a great mentality to get better, to be patient, but also to be frustrated and angry - you get that at times during your career.\"\n\nRobson lost his job four games into the 2004-05 season and was replaced by Graeme Souness, the former Liverpool and Scotland midfielder.\n\nA year after signing for Newcastle, Milner was sent out on loan to Premier League rivals Aston Villa.\n\nSouness defended his decision at the time saying \"you won't win the league with James Milners\". The remark, for which Souness has since apologised, stung the young winger, who would go on and win three Premier League titles.\n\nYet there was more turbulence ahead.\n\nMilner had impressed on loan at Villa so much that in September 2006 they offered around £4m to sign him permanently.\n\nNewcastle accepted and Milner travelled to the West Midlands only to learn upon arrival at Villa Park that the Magpies had pulled out of the deal at the 11th hour at the end of the transfer window.\n\nMilner was bitterly frustrated.\n\nIt would be another two years before he finally sealed a permanent switch to Villa at the age of 22 after 94 top-flight appearances for Newcastle.\n\nFor two seasons he played under Martin O'Neill before another move in 2010.\n\nChelsea had just won a Premier League and FA Cup double under Carlo Ancelotti and wanted to add Milner to their squad.\n\nManchester City were also keen. The trouble was, they had not won anything significant since 1976.\n\nIn the end he opted for the challenge of reviving City's fortunes.\n\nHe left five years later having helped them win two Premier League titles, one FA Cup, one League Cup and one Community Shield.\n\nMilner proved a versatile servant for both Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini, playing in a variety of positions including a stint as a lone striker - and he was popular in the dressing room.\n\n\"We won the Premier League together in 2012 but there were times that season when things were not going well,\" recalls former City defender Micah Richards.\n\n\"He was one of the people who kept everyone going.\"\n\nRichards developed a close bond with Milner but remembers getting the blame for the parody 'Boring James Milner' social media account, which mocked the player, often focusing on ironing, tea and trivial match details.\n\n\"Everyone thought I was behind it,\" says Richards.\n\n\"Whenever a new post went up Milner would say, 'Come on, mate, you've had your fun'. I'd be going, 'I swear, Millie, it's not me!'\n\n\"I ended up messaging the guy behind it, saying, 'Who is this because Milner thinks it's me?'\n\n\"He would not disclose his name but he sent me a picture of himself and it was just some random bloke. I just told him, 'Keep it up - I love it!'\"\n\nMilner played along with the 'boring' tag and during lockdown posted a video of himself cutting his lawn with scissors.\n\nAfter 147 top-flight appearances for City, he was ready for his next challenge.\n\nNext stop...Liverpool, where he won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Uefa Super Cup, Fifa Club World Cup and the Community Shield.\n\nIt was not all trophies and smiles, however, at Anfield.\n\nThere was that red card from his former teacher - and then the time he angered Klopp.\n\n\"One time at half-time he [Klopp] was sharing his thoughts and I was sharing mine,\" Milner adds on the High Performance podcast.\n\n\"I remember him smashing his hands down on the table and saying, 'Will you shut up'. But Jurgen was great, I had a great relationship with him.\"\n\nAfter Liverpool came an offer from Brighton in 2023 to prolong his top-flight career, where he continues to compete in what is his 24th Premier League season.\n\nMilner, who is eight years older than Seagulls boss Hurzeler, became the Premier League's second-oldest goalscorer behind Teddy Sheringham when he scored from the penalty spot against his former club Manchester City earlier this season.\n\nHe celebrated by recreating Diogo Jota's trademark video game controller celebration in tribute to his former Liverpool team-mate, who died in a car crash last July.\n\nMilner is wearing the No 20 shirt for Brighton, the same number Jota wore at Liverpool.\n\n\"I've not scored [in the Premier League] for six years and I was wearing his number. Obviously, I've got help from the great man,\" said an emotional Milner after the match.\n\nWhere does the player who represented England at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups rank on the list of all-time Premier League greats?\n\n\"Milner's name never really is mentioned as one of the greats, but he is, without a doubt,\" says Richards.\n\nFormer Leeds and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson, who played the night Milner made his debut at West Ham in 2002, said his former team-mate had dedicated his life to remain at the top level.\n\n\"It's everything you do, it's how you walk around at home, it's what shoes you wear, it's how you sleep, it's what pillows you sleep on, it's what you eat, it's what you put in your body,\" says Robinson.\n\n\"And for him to have evolved the way that the game's evolved as well, it's huge credit to himself as a person, not just a footballer, but as a person.\"\n\nWill Milner carry on playing when his contract expires in the summer? Having turned 40 in January, he treats every game as though it could be his last.\n\nHe still remembers a conversation with veteran Leeds goalkeeper Nigel Martyn soon after breaking into the first team 24 years ago.\n\n\"He told me, 'Enjoy it while you can because it goes so fast'. I said, 'Leave it out, Nige, I'm 16!'\n\n\"And here we are in the blink of an eye - and I'm where he was.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on 6 February 2026\n\nWho has the most Premier League appearances?\n\nMilner sent off by former PE teacher\n\nLatest Brighton news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Brighton - what do you want to know?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMikel Arteta has been preaching to Arsenal fans that the Premier League title race is a marathon not a sprint.\n\nYet after a gut-wrenching 2-2 draw with Wolves that left the Gunners' lead atop the table slimmed to effectively just two points, the quest for an elusive league crown has reached a breaking point.\n\nThat's where Arsenal's most hated rivals, Tottenham Hotspur, come in.\n\nAs the Gunners search for answers in their hunt for their first Premier League championship since 2004, they are presented with the perfect opportunity for an emotional and impactful turnaround.\n\nIn truth, this North London derby couldn't have come at a better time. It is likely their most important meeting with Spurs in the last two decades, one with more to lose, and also more gain than any in recent memory.\n\nMORE:A full roundup of Arsenal team news and injury updates ahead of the match against Tottenham\n\nThe Gunners' hunt for the 2025/26 Premier League title has never felt shakier than when Tom Edozie bundled home the awkward equaliser for Wolves at the end of their recent draw.\n\nArsenal have been the frontrunners for the EPL championship for much of the last four months. Every time they've opened the door, nobody has been there to walk through it.\n\nYet with just 10 points from their last possible 21, Arsenal have now opened the door wider than before. Manchester City sit five points back with a game in hand, with just a sliver between the two sides with still 12 matches remaining.\n\nMikel Arteta has used up all the cushion that Arsenal had built with their strong run through December, but they are still in the lead, an important and critical distinction.\n\nThe Gunners have one of the softest run-ins of any club this season. Following their upcoming games against Tottenham and Chelsea, Arsenal will finish the year with just one remaining match against the Big Six clubs, being the all-important April 18 match against Man City.\n\nCommon opponents over the final eight matches of the season for the two title chasers are Burnley, Crystal Palace, and Bournemouth. That leaves Arsenal with games against Newcastle, West Ham, and Fulham while Man City have Aston Villa, Brentford, and Everton.\n\nArsenal's current form is miles from that of a title-winner, but they still have it all in front of them.\n\nThe one thing Arsenal has been missing from their title hunt has been a reliable attacking superstar.\n\nBukayo Saka was meant to be that player. The 24-year-old England winger just sealed a new contract which sees him become one of the highest-paid players in the Premier League.\n\nWith his reported new wages \"in excess of £300,000 per week,\" he finds himself amongst the likes of Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, and Bruno Fernandes, all of whom have been reliable performers week-in and week-out. Yet Saka cannot yet count himself amongst those individuals, who have all been key performers in a title-winning season.\n\nYet Saka just has not been that player this season. Sure, injuries have taken a bit of a toll, but he still has had plenty of chances to be a star. Five goals and five assists in 23 games just isn't enough to propel a team to a title.\n\nArsenal has been a true team of contributors this season; there's no question that their depth has been an enormous asset. Yet at the end of the day, titles are won by superstars, and right now, there is a lack of stars on Arsenal.\n\nIt's hard to remember a time when fans of a club the stature of Arsenal were chasing a domestic title with such nervous tension.\n\nArsenal have not won a Premier League title since the Invincibles in 2004, that much has been well documented over the last decade. They have also never won a Champions League crown. It has left this current generation of Arsenal supporters with very little to show for their last 20 years of dedication.\n\nYet because the club is such a behemoth both in England and across Europe, they are expected to, in effect, act like they've been here before.\n\nBut they haven't. Not really. All these fans know is disappointment and near misses. They have repeatedly come up short, having finished second in each of the last three years.\n\nThat's why the Wolves draw felt like such a gut punch. This is the feeling they're so familiar with — as the craving for silverware ramps up, they are repeatedly fed with letdowns.\n\nThis is not to drive in the dagger further, but to explain why they are so uncomfortable in this position. There's no confidence to draw from, only dread.\n\nAll of that, however, can change this weekend. This all leads to Sunday's North London derby...\n\nIn terms of the Premier League title race, there hasn't been a more meaningful meeting between Arsenal and Tottenham in at least two decades, if not longer.\n\nThe last time these two teams met with these kind of stakes, Arsenal clinched their 2003/04 title with a 2-2 draw in late April, but they coughed up a 2-0 lead in that match and had a solid lead that had been inevitable for weeks.\n\nThe Gunners also secured a big 3-2 win over Spurs late in the 2023/24 chase, but that still wasn't enough to push them to the title.\n\nThis year, this game presents a titanic opportunity, and also a huge potential pitfall. Draw or defeat in this match would give Man City the chance to take an effective lead in the title race, a collapse which would serve as a crushing blow both tangibly and emotionally.\n\nYet on the opposite end, there is so much to gain.\n\nThe best chance for an emotional result against the club's biggest rival would be now, as it would erase much of the recent struggles and catapult the feeling of authority atop the Premier League back to the highs of recent months before the slide.\n\n\"The enjoyment comes from moments of suffering as well,\" Mikel Arteta professed after the disappointing draw with Wolves. \"If you believe that you come to any ground in the Premier League and you don’t have to go through tough periods, that’s not the reality, so the enjoyment comes as well from those moments when you’re not at your best. Ok, get through and find out a way to come through that.\"\n\nArsenal have suffered much this season, both to their success and their detriment. Some would argue they have inflicted too much self-imposed suffering on themselves to be Premier League champions. To that end, their 58 points through 27 games is the fewest of any Premier League leader at this point in a season since Leicester City 10 years ago.\n\nVictory here, and Arsenal's title race is once again full steam ahead. Anything less, and the train comes off the track. There's really nothing in between at this point.",

It's a fantastic club. I am very focused to do the right things.\n\n\"It is not about systems. It is important to become a team, a group, who will look after each other.

Their last league victory was a 1-0 success at Crystal Palace on 28 December and they have collected only four out of a possible 24 points in 2026.\n\nSpurs, who finished 17th last season, have been in the top flight of English football in every campaign since one year in the old Second Division in 1977-78.\n\nAsked how confident he was Tottenham would still be in the Premier League next season, Tudor replied \"100%\".\n\nHis first game is at home on Sunday against bitter rivals and current leaders Arsenal, with Spurs facing an injury crisis.\n\n\"It's a very rare situation,\" added Tudor. \"We have 10 injuries, we trained with 13 players.\n\n\"It is an even bigger challenge to succeed from this situation. My first goal is that we become a team in the right meaning of the word, that suffers when it needs to suffer, to fight, to run, to have the right mentality.

But I think this one is especially difficult considering the circumstances where West Ham are and the run that they've had recently.\"\n\nThe Bournemouth boss feels the Hammers have been \"one of the best teams lately in the Premier League\" and his side need to \"be ready to start strong\" to prevent West Ham from scoring first, as they have done in recent games.\n\nAfter receiving a touchline ban for his third yellow card of the season, Iraola has been discussing how he plans to help from the stands: \"I don't wear the thing on the ear and I'm close to the analyst. Normally I go with Ryan [Dawes], and he's the one communicating everything. But it's true that we sometimes, with the subs, we use just text messages. So we see everything clear.\"\n\nHe does not yet know where he will be sitting in the stadium and is a \"little bit worried\" about the time it might take to get to the dressing room at half time, so they will just have to \"see what the best option is\".\n\nOn Marcos Senesi's future after the defender didn't move in the January transfer window: \"I think the situation is still open. I think it's not easy.

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains why more matches in a shorter space of time might mean more injuries, and why the expansion of tournaments does not help players or fans.",
    "fullText": "With the season heading into its final months, games are coming thick and fast, especially for the Premier League clubs still in Europe.\n\nWith the extra games, travelling, time difference and the added disadvantage when teams return to face an away game in the Premier League, player welfare is another problem for managers of those teams. How do you maintain the quality of rest time that you know the players need to perform at the highest level and reduce the risks of injury?\n\nOut of the teams in action this week, Newcastle have had the longest journey. Their 2,529-mile trek to Baku is the furthest distance ever travelled by an English side in the Champions League.\n\nThe journey there and back, plus the difficulty of an away game at Manchester City on Saturday evening, is a tough ask - especially when you factor in how, statistically, the results usually go against the team playing away in Europe.\n\nThis was something I had to deal with at Stoke when we were in the Europa League, and faced long flights to Israel, Ukraine, Croatia and Turkey.\n\nWe tried all kinds of methods to help our recovery, sometimes flying straight back after games, or staying overnight and allowing the medical staff to take the lads in the mornings for a light recovery session, having breakfast then flying home.\n\nIt was really difficult to find the most balanced way. Irrespective of what we tried, having to play an away game that same weekend was really tough, and we suffered a couple of heavy Premier League defeats afterwards.\n\nThe same goes for many teams, though. I don't think anyone has truly found the answer to that particular problem, even if there were ways to manage players' fitness over the course of the season that I used effectively myself.\n\nIn the modern-day game, enormous investment is made into all different departments of Premier League clubs, and the medical and sports science departments are especially well-supported.\n\nToday, these departments offer enormous amounts of data on fitness issues and players are without doubt treated with more care and attention than ever before.\n\nGone are the days where you were encouraged to take pain-killing injections or tablets just to get you on the pitch, which were never questioned. Many players in the 1970s and 80s relied on appearance money and win bonuses to pay their mortgages so going through the pain barrier was never an issue.\n\nThe amount of change in our game since then in all departments is quite astonishing, and obviously most of it has made things better for all concerned.\n\nFor all of those advances, however, there are still questions being asked about soft-tissue injuries and why so many are still occurring.\n\nIn my years in the Premier League, I worked with some fantastic medical staff, club doctors, physios and fitness coaches.\n\nAt the beginning of every pre-season, I would explain what I needed from every single person mentioned above. My main topic was these soft-tissue injuries, like hamstring, calf and groin strains. I believed if the players were prepared and looked after in the right manner then we could avoid them.\n\nMy thinking was that joint injuries occurring from competitive challenges are always going to happen and we could not control those incidents, but muscular issues, we could.\n\nMy pre-season consisted of 10-14 days of endurance work, all within a certain range that would not impede or trouble the players' main leg muscles.\n\nAfter consultation with my medical staff, to ensure the players were strong enough, sessions would get progressively shorter and quicker, with and without the ball.\n\nOnce a solid strength and conditioning base had been implemented, and the season had begun, our general routine would entail pre-activation exercises like glute bridges and band walks, light weights, and lots of movement stretches.\n\nOne hour and 20 minutes each day on the grass was all I wanted and early in the week I would generally push the lads pretty hard, then taper it off closer to game day.\n\nThe above approach worked well for me so, having read up about the number of soft-tissue injuries occurring now, I contacted medical people in the game who I respect to try to find out why.\n\nObviously I wondered if strength and conditioning programmes like the ones I used had dropped off, but I got a big rebuff on that. I was told that, as in most sports, footballers today have got bigger, stronger and quicker.\n\nIt is not down to the players playing more games, either. Manchester United had 66 competitive games in 2008-09, Liverpool had 63 in 2021-22 and this season Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal will all experience something similar.\n\nSo, what has happened over the past five years to affect our top players?\n\nToday, there are more than two or three quick players in every team - the difference there is massive compared to when I started out as a manager more than 30 years ago.\n\nThat means that, while the distance covered by players has not altered much over time, the players are accelerating more, and also more often. It leads to much more stress in the top levels of their payload.\n\nSurely this can be managed? Yes, but it is getting harder. Not because players are playing more games, but because they are playing more in a shorter period of time.\n\nOver the past few years, players have started to question the amount of games they are now asked to play at international level, on top of the demands of club football.\n\nFifa and Uefa have increased everything, not just the fixture lists, but the number and size of competitions too.\n\nLet's start with this year's World Cup, where a record 48 teams will be competing and playing a total of 104 games - double the number the last time the tournament was held in the United States in 1994. It will take 72 group games to lose just 16 of those teams before the first knockout stage.\n\nSimilarly, the new Champions League format also has a busload of teams.\n\nIt takes 144 games to get rid of 12 of the 36 clubs, before you even reach the knockout stages, and I have completely ignored all these early matches as I don't understand how teams can lose game after game but still qualify for the next round.\n\nAdd to this two Europa League competitions and a new Club World Cup format and you can understand how busy Fifa and Uefa have been in building up their own empires.\n\nI congratulate the so-called smaller countries who will experience the World Cup for the first time this summer.\n\nHopefully millions of supporters will enjoy the experience too but I am sure many neutral supporters will question the adage that bigger is better, especially because the expansion of all of these tournaments will adversely affect the Premier League.\n\nFor me, the Premier League is the best league in the world and we should be protecting it.\n\nMany people in the game are concerned about player safety and although I am old school when it comes to how you look after players, I do believe that the top teams and players should be protected more to ensure our league remains the best and also the most successful in the world.\n\nTeams in the NFL, the only international sports league that can compare with the Premier League's success, only play one game a week.\n\nIt is an elite league, with elite players, and although they play a different sport which means that, physically, they operate on a different level, they are very conscious of having their best players in their best shape for their clubs and games.\n\nThe same should apply to the Premier League and the governing bodies in our country must be very careful with this dramatic increase in Fifa and Uefa's conquest of new concepts and new competitions.\n\nOur top players should not be used as cash cows to play in competitions that are over-subscribed.\n\nI believe football's top competitions should showcase our elite players at their peak level for their clubs and countries, so the Champions League and World Cup should be an almighty step up in class and a different level to anything we see on our own domestic stage.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the case. In my view, Fifa and Uefa have watered down both competitions, and it feels to me like the main aim now is to make a shed-load of money from games that have no substance, and little meaning.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

Of course, he cannot read the future, so they will often be wrong as well. But from my experience, whenever he predicts Chelsea games, he is more often than not, not too far off the ball.\n\nChelsea welcome relegation battling Burnley in the 3pm kick off in the Premier League on Saturday, and they will need to avoid a repeat of what happened during their last game against a relegation battling side.\n\nThe Blues were cruising it against Leeds United but then threw it away and let them come back into the game, earning a draw in the end.\n\nPaul Merson worried about Chelsea on Sky Sports.\n\nWriting for Sportskeeda, Merson said:\n\n‘Burnley had a great result against Crystal Palace but it looks like a fluke after their FA Cup exit to Mansfield Town. I can’t see anything but a Chelsea win here, they will destroy Burnley this weekend!\n\n‘This is a must-win game for Chelsea because from here, the fixtures get messy for them. It’s a horrendous run coming up. Liam Rosenior likes deploying Andrey Santos and Moises Caicedo in the base of his midfield. I expect Enzo Fernandez to continue as the no.10, with Cole Palmer and Pedro Neto either side of Joao Pedro.\n\n‘I like Palmer as a no.10. I think that’s his best position. But Santos has been one of the best performers under Rosenior so I don’t think Chelsea will change anything. They also need some continuity in their starting line-up ahead of what promises to be a challenging run of fixtures.\n\n‘Chelsea can’t afford another slip-up like the one against Leeds. If that happens, they won’t finish inside the top five!’\n\nHis Prediction: Chelsea 3-0 Burnley.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have reportedly set their sights on Bournemouth defender Marcos Senesi, who will become a free agent in the summer.\n\nThe Argentine is a San Lorenzo academy product who arrived in Europe through the gates of Feyenoord in 2019. After three years in the Netherlands, he signed for the Cherries in the summer of 2022, and has been a stalwart at the club ever since.\n\nBut while Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola described Senesi as ‘very valuable’, the latter is expected to leave the Vitality Stadium once his contract expires at the end of the season. This situation has piqued the interest of a host of European suitors, including Man Utd.\n\nAccording to Tuttosport, Juventus have offered the centre-back a four-year deal and a salary of €3 million per season.\n\nThe Turin-based newspaper believes that the Bianconeri are trying to secure a swift agreement with Senesi and his entourage to ward off the competition.\n\nMarcos Senesi and Bruno Fernandes (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nThe source adds that several other European clubs are ‘keen’ to sign the Bournemouth man, including Man Utd. The other suitors are Barcelona, ​​Dortmund, Atlético Madrid, Brighton, and Crystal Palace.\n\nAs reported in recent days, United will be looking to add a new centre-back to their ranks, even if Harry Maguire ends up signing a new contract.\n\nSenesi represents a potential bargain for INEOS, as signing him on a free transfer and on affordable wages would allow them to allocate their transfer funds to other departments, especially the midfield.\n\nThe left-footed Senesi could be a back-up for his compatriot Lisandro Martinez. However, his arrival could reduce Ayden Heaven’s chances of earning playing time, which could prompt a loan move.\n\nIn any case, it remains to be seen if Man Utd’s reported interest in the Argentine will be confirmed by British sources, and whether the Red Devils will make concrete moves in the coming days and weeks.",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Embrace bassist Steve Firth plus the BBC readers and AI with his predictions for this weekend's Premier League fixtures.",
    "fullText": "New Tottenham boss Igor Tudor's first game in charge is Sunday's north London derby - but will he make a dream start at home against Arsenal or have a nightmare?\n\n\"Tottenham's stadium has been an unhappy place all season,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. \"Tudor's problem, if he doesn't get off to a fast start, is that there is going to be negativity around him too.\n\n\"Spurs are in a relegation fight and their fans will be asking why have we employed someone to keep us up who doesn't have a lot of knowledge of the Premier League?\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 27 is Embrace bassist Steve Firth, who is a fan of Leeds United, who are 15th in the Premier League table after gaining promotion last season.\n\nEmbrace are celebrating their 30th anniversary in 2026 and their new track, Road To Nowhere, is out now and their new album, Avalanche, out in June.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nFirth's favourite Leeds players are mostly from the 1990s, when he was an Elland Road regular, but more recently he was a big fan of midfielder Kalvin Phillips too.\n\n\"I always loved Gordon Strachan, Gary McAllister and David Batty - we had a superb midfield then,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Then we had Tony Yeboah up front for a couple of seasons, and he was amazing too.\n\n\"There were so many good players for Leeds back then, but I didn't get to see Eric Cantona play for us - that's the one thing I regret.\n\n\"In the past few years, Phillips really stood out before he went to Manchester City. He was a genuine superstar of the future when he was playing for us, so it is shame what has happened with him since.\n\n\"Now? The whole team has turned things around in the past few months because we were in serious trouble in November, but we have only lost a couple of games since then.\n\n\"I do think we're definitely safe now - we are going to do all right from now on and we will finish in mid-table.\n\n\"That is all we can really aspire to at the moment as a promoted team. You just need to hang in there as long as you can really and build up your squad slowly, without over-spending.\n\n\"We've started doing that already. We were very lucky to get Dominic Calvert-Lewin in for nothing, because he has been brilliant.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Steve Firth were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nI was at Elland Road when Aston Villa won there in November - Leeds were really good in the first half but faded, and two Morgan Rogers goals gave Villa the points.\n\nLeeds' form has picked up a lot since then, however, and they are on 30 points now.\n\nThat would have been enough to keep them up last season, when third-bottom Leicester went down with 25 points, but they have still got some work to do.\n\nVilla have slipped up a couple of times at home in the past few weeks, losing unexpectedly to Everton and Brentford, and they are probably looking at the table thinking they should be breathing down leaders Arsenal's neck.\n\nI can see Leeds giving them another good game, but I don't see Unai Emery's side dropping points this time. Villa will find a way.\n\nSteve's prediction: This is a tough game but we're on a good run of form and I think we'll get a draw. 1-1\n\nSteve on why he supports Leeds: I'm from Halifax and everyone there either supports Leeds, Huddersfield or Manchester United. I've been a Leeds fan since the 1970s but the time I watched them most was in the 1990s - that's when I'd go most weeks.\n\nSince then, of the guys I went with, one died and the other one moved away so I got out of the habit and I only get to the occasional game now. But my wife is a Mansfield fan, so I have to go and watch them sometimes. I was hoping they would get Leeds in the FA Cup fifth round - we would definitely have gone to that one - but they got Arsenal instead.\n\nI covered Brentford in the FA Cup tie at Macclesfield on Monday and they were completely underwhelming.\n\nI know they were on a plastic pitch but they couldn't really find their flow and needed an own goal to progress.\n\nStill, the Bees have been in much better form in the Premier League - in stark contrast to Brighton.\n\nFabian Hurzeler's side have won only one of their past 13 league games in a poor run going back to the start of December, and it is not impossible they could get dragged into the relegation scrap.\n\nI can see this one being close but Brentford will have Kevin Schade back from suspension, while Igor Thiago will also return after being rested against Macclesfield - and those two should make the difference.\n\nSteve's prediction: Brentford are too good for Brighton. My predictions are going to be very conservative by the way, there are no 5-0s! 2-1\n\nSo much for me thinking that Burnley might give their fans something to cheer about by going on a good FA Cup run.\n\nAfter their brilliant fightback to beat Crystal Palace in their last league game, the Clarets made changes against Mansfield and went out on their own patch to a League One side.\n\nI just can't see anything other than a home win for Chelsea here, even with their wobble last time at Stamford Bridge where Leeds fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 - Liam Rosenior's side won't let that happen again.\n\nSteve's prediction: Definitely a Chelsea win here. My wife was very happy when Mansfield beat Burnley last week. 2-0\n\nWest Ham are still in the bottom three but they have shown they are up for the fight in the past few weeks.\n\nYes, they conceded a late equaliser against Manchester United in their last league game, but they keep on picking up points and that must have given them belief they can stay up.\n\nBournemouth are on a good run now too, with three wins in their past four league games but, along with Brighton, they are the Premier League's draw specialists this season - both have had 10 so far.\n\nIt finished 2-2 when these two sides met on the south coast in November and I can see the points being shared this time too.\n\nSteve's prediction: I am going with Bournemouth to edge this. 1-2\n\nThis is the fourth meeting between these two clubs already this season, with another to come soon in the FA Cup fifth round - I bet they are sick of each other already.\n\nNewcastle have a long trip back from Azerbaijan to contend with before this game but at least they have put their Champions League tie with Qarabag to bed already and can focus fully on City rather than next week's second leg.\n\nThe Magpies still have an awful record at Etihad, however - they lost here in the Carabao Cup in January and have never managed a win in 20 visits in the Premier League.\n\nI don't think this will be easy for City, but I do think they will beat them, again, to move within two points of Arsenal.\n\nThe only thing I am not sure about is whether to captain Erling Haaland in my Fantasy team, because he has been out injured.\n\nSteve's prediction: I've always liked Newcastle but I think City are going to win the league so I am going to back them here. 2-0\n\nFair play to Wolves, because they have turned a bit of a corner under Rob Edwards.\n\nTheir results have still never looked like being enough to keep them up but they showed again against Arsenal that they are at least being competitive now.\n\nEven so, I can see this game being all about Jorgen Strand Larsen, following his £48m move from Wolves to Palace at the end of the January transfer window.\n\nPalace still need the points and I would not be surprised if he has a say in the outcome - let's go for him to score the winner.\n\nSteve's prediction: Wolves are down so I am giving Palace this one. 2-0\n\nWhen Vítor Pereira went in as Wolves manager in December 2024, he did brilliantly to keep them up - but he has essentially taken them down this season, picking up only two points from 10 games before he was sacked.\n\nNow he has arrived at Forest as their fourth manager of the season.\n\nI don't think his predecessor, Sean Dyche, deserved the sack. Based on the results in his 18 games in charge, Forest would be 12th in the table, but we are used to seeing managerial changes at the City Ground now.\n\nWe know Pereira will try to keep things tight, but Forest's biggest issue throughout this campaign has been scoring goals and I am not sure they will be able to get at Liverpool.\n\nArne Slot's side became the first team to win at the Stadium of Light when they edged out Sunderland in their last league game, and I can see a similar outcome here.\n\nSteve's prediction: Forest might get a new manager bounce but I still think Liverpool will win. As a Mansfield fan, my wife hates Forest so I am not allowed to like them either! It's the same with Chesterfield too. 0-2\n\nSunderland's form has dropped off a little bit in recent weeks but they have still had a phenomenal season and are probably safe already on 36 points - now they just have to see it through.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Regis le Bris's side respond to their first home defeat of the season, but Fulham are hardly on a great run either with three straight league losses.\n\nMarco Silva's side beat the Black Cats at Craven Cottage in November, and will leapfrog them in the table if they win this time too - but I don't think that will happen.\n\nSteve's prediction: I wasn't sure about this one because they are both decent sides so I am going for a draw. 1-1\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 16:30\n\nFrom what I've read about new Tottenham manager Igor Tudor, he is a guy who goes in at clubs and, in the short term, gets a turn out of his team.\n\nSpurs really need that to happen now, because they desperately need a win or two to get out of reach of relegation.\n\nSo, this game is big for them for that reason, and also because they can put another dent in Arsenal's title hopes too.\n\nSpurs and their fans have not had a lot to shout about this season, but if they can get something here then this could be a defining moment in their campaign, and affect Arsenal as well. They would love that.\n\nIt was an incredible wobble by Mikel Arteta's team against Wolves, drawing 2-2 after being 2-0 up, and I certainly didn't see it coming.\n\nMaybe it is getting to be 'squeaky bum time' for them, but it didn't affect them when they went away to Leeds a couple of weeks ago and won convincingly.\n\nYou can imagine how Spurs will be champing at the bit, and I am expecting them to make a fast start and have a real go at them - but Arsenal have to deal with that, and find a way of bouncing back.\n\nI think the Gunners can do that, and their quality will make the difference in the end. I worry about Spurs in forward areas and it will be interesting to see how Tudor lines them up in defence too.\n\nUltimately, if Arsenal turn up and play how we know they can, then they will win - and I am expecting them to make a real statement.\n\nSteve's prediction: Two bottlers here! I'd like Arsenal to win the league, but I don't think they will. Man City are just used to doing it from here - they just get their heads down in the run-in, and they know what to do. 2-3\n\nManchester United lost at home to Everton in November despite the Toffees going down to 10 men in the 13th minute, when Idrissa Gueye was sent off for striking his team-mate Michael Keane.\n\nRuben Amorim's United just could not find a way of breaking Everton down that night, but there is a very different feel about them now Michael Carrick is in charge.\n\nThey needed a stoppage-time equaliser to get a point at West Ham last time out but they seem much more confident and have been playing well.\n\nThis will be a tough game for them but, as I've mentioned previously, Everton have picked up more points on the road this season than they have done at home.\n\nThat's another reason why I fancy United to get something here, and stop David Moyes doing the double over his former club.\n\nSteve's prediction: We were all enjoying United's mid-table mediocrity but they have started to win now. 1-2\n\nChris correctly picked the winner in 10 of the 15 fourth-round ties to have been played so far - Port Vale versus Swindon was postponed and takes place on 3 March.\n\nHe got the better of his guests, Looney Tunes stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig - Daffy has nine correct predictions, while Porky has eight.\n\nAI did better with a score of 11, again by avoiding any surprise results, but it is the BBC readers who continue to lead the way, with a tally of 13.\n\nOverall, Chris has now correctly picked the winner in 31 of the 47 ties from round three onwards.\n\nHis guests are on 26, AI is on 34, but the BBC readers are in pole position with 36.\n\nThe shock of the round was Mansfield's win at Burnley which caught out Chris, AI, and most of you lot.\n\nDaffy and Porky did see it coming, however, and out of around 25,000 predictions, more than 3,000 of you also backed the Stags.\n\nChris got three correct results from the 10 midweek Premier League matches in week 26 [which took place from 10-12 February] with one exact score, for a total of 60 points.\n\nThat was enough to beat the BBC readers, who got three correct results with no exact scores, giving them 30 points.\n\nHe also got the better of his guest, golf star Ian Poulter, who got two correct results with no exact scores, for a tally of 20 points.\n\nBut the weekly win went to AI, which got four correct results with two exact scores, for a tally of 100 points.\n\nThere was one other Premier League game played this week - Arsenal's draw with Wolves on Wednesday, which was rearranged because the Gunners are in the Carabao Cup final on 22 March.\n\nEveryone went for an Arsenal victory, so no extra points were scored.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Chelsea return to Premier League action on Saturday as Burnley make the trip to Stamford Bridge.\n\nLiam Rosenior’s side were left frustrated after surrendering a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at Leeds last time out, missing the opportunity to climb into the top four.\n\nThey now welcome a Burnley side reeling from a shock FA Cup exit and looking to steady themselves in league play.\n\nChelsea vs Burnley is scheduled for a 3 pm GMT kick-off on Saturday, February 21, 2026, at Stamford Bridge.\n\nDue to the traditional Saturday 3 pm blackout in the UK, the match will not be shown live on television. Supporters can catch free highlights via the Sky Sports app and YouTube channel from 5:15 pm, while Match of the Day will air on BBC One at 10:30 pm GMT.\n\nFans wanting live coverage can follow minute-by-minute updates through dedicated matchday blogs, with on-the-ground analysis and reaction throughout the afternoon.\n\nCole Palmer is expected to return to the Chelsea squad after being left out previously, as his minutes are managed. Romeo Lavia is also back in contention, providing a boost in midfield.\n\nMarc Cucurella will miss out due to a hamstring injury sustained against Leeds, with no confirmed timeline for his return.\n\nJamie Gittens, Filip Jorgensen, and Dario Essugo are not expected back before the end of the month, while Levi Colwill remains a long-term absentee.\n\nBurnley have fewer concerns, with Axel Tuanzebe the only player nearing a return from injury, though he is not expected back until March.\n\nChelsea will be eager to respond to their recent slip and should carry enough quality to control proceedings at home. Burnley’s struggles on the road suggest the Blues can reassert themselves and build momentum ahead of a key clash with Arsenal next week.\n\nPrediction: Chelsea 3-0 Burnley.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has urged his side to use the \"pain\" of a shock 2-2 draw with Wolves when they look to revive their Premier League title challenge against arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe Gunners were on course for a routine win on Wednesday after goals from Bukayo Saka and Piero Hincapie put them 2-0 up at Molineux.\n\nBut bottom of the table Wolves hit back through Hugo Bueno and Tom Edozie.\n\nThe draw left Arsenal, bidding to end a 22-year-wait to be crowned champions of England again, just five points clear of second-placed Manchester City.\n\nIt was the second match in a row where Arsenal had dropped points following a draw with Brentford and meant they have now won just twice in their last seven league games.\n\nCity, who have a game in hand, twice chased Arsenal down to win the Premier League in both the 2022/23 and 2023/24 seasons and their April clash with the Gunners could prove pivotal to the title race.\n\nBut Arteta said: \"I'm going to be the first one to be close with them (the players) because it has nothing to do with attitude or desire, it is completely the opposite.\n\n\"It's part of football. Where it could've gone wrong today, it went wrong.\n\n\"If you look at the way we conceded the two goals today without conceding any other situations, it is very rare but it happens. And it happened for a reason and we need to react.\n\n\"If you are at the top you have to win and win, that's nothing new.\"\n\nArsenal are away to struggling Tottenham in a north London derby on Sunday, with Arteta saying: \"We need to go through the pain and go through it looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now and the next action is Sunday. We need to keep all that in our tummies to show it on Sunday.\"\n\nMeanwhile Saka told Arsenal.com: \"It's pretty flat. We're pretty disappointed with the result, it's the only way to describe it.\n\n\"I think it's a game of two halves. In the first half we started so well but in the second half we dropped the level and got punished for it.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the derby match, the England international added: \"It was already a big game and now it's still a big game...It's still in our control so we just need to focus on that, fix the issues we're having now and get back to winning ways.\"",

    "fullText": "After blowing a two-goal lead to draw against the Premier League's bottom club Wolves, there will be no dodging the questions on whether Arsenal are mentally ready to end their 22-year wait to become champions.\n\nFor the first time really this season, the title race is not completely in the control of Mikel Arteta and his players.\n\nIf Manchester City - five points behind in second place - win all of their remaining 12 games, which includes a home meeting against Arsenal, they will finish first.\n\nThe same, though, can be said for the Gunners, who have 11 matches left - and they win the April encounter at Etihad Stadium.\n\nBut after dropping four crucial points in successive draws against Brentford and Wolves, they are in danger of being haunted by the ghost of past failures.\n\nThree successive runners-up finishes, two of them to Pep Guardiola's men, provide a constant reminder.\n\nFormer Arsenal forward Alan Smith admitted \"that word bottle will be used quite a bit in the next few days\".\n\nThe scenario seemed a lot different when Piero Hincapie slotted home his first goal for the club in the 56th minute, adding to Bukayo Saka's fifth-minute opener.\n\nBut the Gunners lacked the control and ruthlessness to finish off a Wolves side that had lost their nine previous meetings and are heading for the Championship.\n\nThe hosts showed remarkable spirit to fight back with Hugo Bueno's 20-yard curler giving them hope. Then, in the fourth minute of added time, 19-year-old Tom Edozie - off the bench for his senior debut - pounced on a mix-up between Arsenal pair David Raya and Gabriel and his shot went in off Riccardo Calafiori for a dramatic, dreamy leveller.\n\nArsenal next face London derbies with Tottenham and Chelsea and they have worryingly started to wobble at a decisive stage in the season.\n\nArteta knows his side will come under fire and scrutiny.\n\n\"Any opinion you have to take it on the chin,\" he said. \"Any bullet, take it, because we didn't perform at the level required.\n\n\"Anything anyone says can be right because we didn't do what we had to do. The way to do it is on the pitch on Sunday [against Spurs].\"\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards said his side \"knew there is a massive pressure\" on Arsenal at the minute - and they capitalised on that.\n\nThe Gunners have not been performing at their best since the start of 2026 and won only two of their last seven league matches, with victories against Leeds and Sunderland.\n\nArteta added: \"Certain basics we have to do, we did them so poorly, one after the other.\n\n\"It is better not to judge it. We are all too emotional about it. You have to take the hit because we deserve it. It is very easy with emotion to say things that can damage the team. Everyone wants to do their best.\"\n\nOnly Crystal Palace and West Ham (both eight) have dropped more points from winning positions in the league in 2026 than Arsenal (seven) and the Gunners have now failed to win from a leading position in three of their last five league games.\n\nThis was also the first time in Premier League history that a side starting the day bottom of the table avoided defeat to the leaders, despite trailing by two or more goals.\n\n\"It feels like a pivotal moment, a vital one, maybe a turning point,\" Smith added on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's in Manchester City's hands now. With their experience and Guardiola's experience they will really fancy it now. They can almost feel the nerves of the Arsenal team watching that.\n\n\"Having been 2-0 up against the team rock bottom on nine points is just not good enough for the team hoping to win the title. It doesn't bode well for Arsenal to be able to handle the pressure.\"\n\nPressure mounts as Arsenal blow two-goal lead to draw at Wolves\n\nThe result also meant Arsenal failed to win an away league game in which they had a two-goal lead for the first time since April 2023 at West Ham, stretching back 18 matches.\n\nForward Saka, who ended a 15-match goal drought in all competitions, said there was a \"big difference\" with how his side performed in the second half compared to the first.\n\n\"Disappointed, not much else to say,\" added the England international. \"We dropped our standards big time and we got punished for it.\"\n\nJust a day after signing a new five-year deal, he had put his side in front after playing in the No10 role again, but could only watch in dismay at the end having gone off in the 73rd minute after receiving treatment.\n\n\"It's very flat,\" added Saka. \"It's time for us to reflect on the last few performances and fix the issues immediately, so we can get back to winning games, go on a run and build momentum because we've lost that a bit right now.\"\n\n\"I just think we have to get back to our level. Do the basics right and we've got more than enough quality in this team to win games, especially in the games where we've been dropping points in recently. We need to fix that and that's all our focus is right now.\"\n\nWith a north London derby to follow at Tottenham on Sunday, Arsenal have to respond quickly.\n\nSpurs will have Igor Tudor at the helm and they will hope he can give them the 'new manager bounce' to add to the Gunners' misery.\n\nArteta admitted: \"We need to go through the pain, looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now on Sunday.\n\n\"Anything we say from here is fine but we need to keep it all in our tummies and show it on Sunday.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "You do not need to look far to find people proclaiming that VAR works fine outside the Premier League. BBC Sport spoke to people across Europe's top leagues to find out.",
    "fullText": "\"I believe we forgot the reason why VAR was introduced,\" Uefa referees' chief Roberto Rosetti said last week.\n\nHis choice of words was important. This was not a criticism of the Premier League.\n\nIt was aimed across Europe. And it was about the rise of \"microscopic\" video assistant referee interventions.\n\nIn England the media coverage of refereeing is savage. Any perceived mistake is pounced upon.\n\nSocial media is full of people saying VAR works fine elsewhere, that the standard of refereeing is better in other top divisions.\n\nIn the Premier League, are we largely cocooned from much of the controversy in the other top European leagues? BBC Sport spoke to people across the leagues to find out.\n\nBundesliga fans have been relentlessly against VAR from day one.\n\nMany terraces have 'Videobeweis abschaffen' (Eliminate VAR) banners held up in the ultras section for the duration of each review.\n\nFor all the controversy of VAR in the Premier League, it is rare to see this type of big public display. Chants yes, but not banners.\n\nIn Germany it is different. Take Augsburg fans before their fixture against Heidenheim on Sunday.\n\nBehind the goal there was a sea of messages against VAR.\n\n\"Football with VAR is like horse racing with donkeys,\" read one banner, following a penalty they had conceded against Mainz which VAR did not cancel.\n\nBBC Sport has been provided with the most up to date official data from the German top flight.\n\nIt showed that the rate of interventions is higher in Germany, but the frequency of mistakes virtually identical. That is one every 16 games in England, and 15.66 in Germany.\n\nThe numbers are collated internally, with only the Premier League having an independent body to judge performance.\n\nVAR swamps the media coverage in Germany too, with the nation's football association (DFB) trying several tactics.\n\nOnly last weekend the head of referees, Knut Kircher, sat in the TV studio throughout Saturday's matches to try to offer perspective.\n\nIt was the equivalent of Howard Webb, referees' boss at Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO), appearing on Final Score.\n\nThe DFB felt it was positive but Munich-based newspaper Suddeutsche wrote that Kircher should \"focus on improving referee performance\".\n\n\"VAR has caused a lot of unrest here,\" NTV journalist Stephan Uersfeld told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It continues to be what we call 'Schuldverschiebung' - passing on the blame - to the VAR instead of the on-field decisions.\n\n\"While it brings some fairness to the game, it has become a bureaucrat's dream.\"\n\nThe Bundesliga introduced semi-automated offside this season but its microscopic decisions and unreliability have only increased the controversy.\n\nIn January, broadcaster ZDF polled coaches, external in the top two divisions. Of the 27 respondents, 16 said they were unsatisfied by VAR.\n\nAnother survey carried out by NTV, external found that 80% of coaches felt VAR delays were excessively long. The opinion was that VAR has not improved.\n\nIf Premier League fans thought VAR had a better reputation in Germany, that clearly is not the case.\n\nIn Spain you won't see any great public displays of dissatisfaction in the stands. The league has plenty of other problems with officiating.\n\nLast summer, the Spanish FA replaced its entire refereeing committee and became the first major league to separate the roles completely.\n\nA team of 15 dedicated VARs work only as a video assistant.\n\nYet it didn't take long for the first error to happen, and again the semi-automated technology was at fault.\n\nIt failed to identify a goalscorer was offside, the officials did not realise and the goal counted. The VAR team was stood down from its next appointments.\n\nSpecialist VARs have long since been suggested as the big fix.\n\nBut BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague says it has made no difference.\n\n\"There is no agreement of what VAR should do or how referees should act,\" Balague said. \"The suggestion was to use VAR less. Less than what?\n\n\"Why less if it is necessary? But when is it necessary?\"\n\nIt is the question that nobody appears able to answer, in any league.\n\nReal Madrid's TV channel produces videos criticising referees on a weekly basis.\n\nAt the weekend, Barcelona issued a statement, external highlighting \"repeated refereeing decisions it considers damaging to the game\".\n\nIt followed an incredible eight-minute VAR review to disallow a goal for offside against Atletico Madrid. Again, the semi-automated technology was faulty.\n\nMarca analysed, external incidents covered in the league's version of 'Match Officials Mic'd Up'.\n\nIt found 10 errors in the first 18 rounds of games - higher than the Bundesliga or the Premier League. The paper said that there would further errors not covered by the programme.\n\n\"The feeling is that VAR has complicated the game, instead of purifying it,\" Balague added. \"What was meant to simplify decisions, scientific, transparent, logical has instead made them more obscure, interpretative, anything but clear.\n\n\"Supporters in Spain often leave stadiums not just disagreeing with decisions, but also confused by them.\n\n\"The technology feels distant from the emotion of the sport.\"\n\nSerie A is in a unique position.\n\nPlayers, coaches and the media complain just as fiercely as their Premier League counterparts.\n\nDavide Chinellato, the UK correspondent for La Gazzetta dello Sport, says there is one subtle difference. Serie A not only wants VAR, it \"would prefer more intervention rather than less\".\n\n\"Unlike in England, the average Italian fan cannot imagine modern football without it,\" Chinellato told BBC Sport.\n\nThe league is backing reviewing corners and second yellow cards, which is set to be approved by the International Football Association Board on 28 February.\n\n\"What is changing is the level of frustration,\" Chinellato said. \"The expectation in Italy is that every clear mistake should be corrected.\n\n\"When that does not happen, the reaction is not to question VAR itself, but to question the rules governing its use.\"\n\nTake Lazio supporters last month after the club suffered from a couple of errors.\n\n\"Transparency on VAR, audio justifications without logic or sense,\" a banner read.\n\n\"They invent everything to ruin old-fashioned football.\"\n\nThere are similar opinions from players.\n\nVeteran Napoli defender Juan Jesus hit out at current VAR standards., external\n\nHe said: \"There's nothing but controversy. It becomes hard for everyone to remain passionate about football.\"\n\nItaly might like VAR, but difficult and technical decisions are problematic.\n\n\"Fans and media are increasingly impatient with what they see as excessive complexity,\" Chinellato added. \"They want broader, clearer, more straightforward guidelines.\n\n\"A system that aligns more closely with the basic expectation that obvious mistakes should be corrected.\"\n\nNo one has been able to define an obvious error.\n\nIn France, the story is different.\n\nLigue 1 has the highest intervention rate, pretty much every other game.\n\nAcross the first 198 matches there were 83 VAR interventions. The referee has stuck with his decision nine times, far more than any other league.\n\nFrance suffers more errors, 17. That is one every 11.65 games compared to 16 in England.\n\nThere is frustration for supporters, but most of the noise comes from the boardroom.\n\nIt is compounded by the collapse of TV rights. It means budgets have been squeezed.\n\n\"The referee system, including VAR, is costing 25m euros by season,\" L'Equipe journalist Pierre-Etienne Minonzio told BBC Sport.\n\n\"So in a time when all the clubs need money, they think it's too expensive.\"\n\nLuc Hagege, who writes about refereeing for L'Equipe, says there is a \"misunderstanding between the objective of VAR and the perception of some players, coaches, but mostly presidents\".\n\nOne of the most outspoken critics has been Lille president Olivier Letang, who says there is a \"a breakdown of trust\" with referees.\n\n\"The perception is that coaches feel a kind of arrogance from referees,\" Hagege added.\n\n\"Most people, and especially the directors, feel that a gap is growing.\"\n\nMany other figures within clubs have been critical.\n\nLyon captain Corentin Tolisso said in November: \"There are mistakes every weekend. We're paying a very high price for the level of refereeing.\"\n\nHagege said errors are magnified by the clubs and the media.\n\n\"We speak much more of the mistakes than of all the things that have been corrected,\" he added.\n\n\"A few even said that they are fed up with the VAR, we should withdraw it.\"\n\nPerhaps there is one factor which binds all five leagues.\n\nAs Rosetti said, fans and pundits asking \"where is VAR?\"\n\nIt appears to have created a gradual creep into more areas of the game. It will be hard to stop.\n\nFootball must avoid 'microscopic' VAR - Uefa refs' chief\n\nThe big VAR debate: with, without or change its scope?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The Premier League big six are concerned about a proposed centralised advertising model that could generate an additional £750 million annually, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nPremier League officials presented the proposal during a recent shareholder meeting.\n\nThey outlined plans to adopt a US-style system where the league would negotiate and sell a significant portion of pitch-side advertising on behalf of all clubs.\n\nThe model would see 60% of perimetre advertising controlled centrally while increasing the number of top-tier commercial partners from seven to 10.\n\nThe league would then distribute the additional revenue among the 20 clubs based on various performance and commercial criteria.\n\nHowever, the proposal has reportedly been met with scepticism from members of the so-called big six – Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool.\n\nWhile none of the clubs publicly commented, sources suggest several are unconvinced about the proposal’s overall value.\n\nOne major concern centres on the extensive commercial operations already run by top clubs, with many believing their in-house expertise surpasses what a league-wide structure could deliver.\n\nThere are also fears surrounding potential conflicts with existing sponsorship deals.\n\nFor instance, if the league were to secure a central automotive partner, it could clash with club-specific agreements already in place.\n\nUnder current rules, the league allows five minutes of pitch-side advertising per match, with broadcasters controlling three minutes when games are televised.\n\nThe new proposal would significantly change how those commercial opportunities are sold and distributed.\n\nDespite resistance from leading clubs, the initiative could attract support from smaller teams looking to benefit from the global commercial pull of the league’s biggest brands and bolster their finances.\n\nLeague insiders maintain that the proposal is backed by strong financial analysis and is being explored to maximise collective revenues, with further discussions expected before any formal vote is introduced.",

    "fullText": "England winger Bukayo Saka has signed a new five-year contract with Arsenal until 2031.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that the agreement will make Saka the club's best-paid player on wages in excess of £300,000 a week.\n\nTalks over a new deal have been ongoing for nearly a year, with Saka verbally agreeing to commit his future to the club in January.\n\nSaka signed his previous deal, which was due to expire in 2027, in 2023 but his renewal means the 24-year-old has committed his peak years to the Gunners.\n\nThe news comes as a major boost for the Gunners, as they battle on four fronts to win silverware for the first time since 2020.\n\nThe agreement is the latest example of Arsenal tying down their key players to long-term contracts as they look to keep their title-chasing squad together.\n\nWilliam Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly all signed new long-term contracts in the summer.\n\nSaka has scored seven goals in 33 appearances for the Gunners this term.\n\nHe made his first-team debut as a 17-year-old in 2018 after coming through Arsenal's academy and has gone on to make 217 Premier League appearances, scoring 57 goals.\n\nSaka is 116 Premier League appearances behind Ray Parlour's record 333 for the Gunners and will have been a professional at the club for 13 years when his new deal expires in 2031.\n\nSaka has scored 14 goals in 48 appearances for England and is expected to be part of Thomas Tuchel's squad for the World Cup which begins in June.\n\nArsenal are four points clear at the top of the Premier League and they will face Manchester City in the EFL Cup final in March.\n\nThe Gunners are also through to the the knockout stages of the Champions League, as well as the fifth round of the FA Cup.\n\nIs number 10 role the next step for Saka?\n\nThe agreement with Saka is more important than the £250m outlay Arsenal made to bring in eight new players in the summer.\n\nSaka's importance on the pitch alongside his bond with supporters and his journey from the academy make his position impossible to replicate.\n\nHis new deal will see him stay at the club into the peak years of his career and - after several seasons with numbers that match elite wingers across the game - Arsenal will benefit from the progression he could still achieve.\n\nThe second half of this season is crucial for Saka as he looks to help Arsenal lift a major trophy for the first time since the FA Cup in 2020.\n\nMikel Arteta can rely on him and he is one of the reasons why the majority of Arsenal's attacking play goes down the right - the side Saka plays on.\n\nThe winger is also set for an important summer with Thomas Tuchel's England at the World Cup.\n\nEngland fans will hope that after a season of success with Arsenal, he can deliver for his country on the biggest stage.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Is hiring Igor Tudor a stroke of genius or a disastrous appointment by the board?\n\nThe fact that no-one seems able to answer this question with any great conviction has done nothing to either calm my nerves or excite me.\n\nOn the one hand, the Croat has a reasonably impressive track record of improving teams over a short-term period. Essentially, this is all we really need from him so we can avoid relegation, before we appoint a permanent head coach in the summer.\n\nHowever, Tudor is also known for his high-intensity style of play, with training sessions and fitness work testing players to their limits.\n\nNormally this would not concern me, but given our current injury crisis and ongoing issues within our medical department, I am not sure the ghost of Antonio Conte past is the wisest approach right now.\n\nUltimately, as long as Tudor can do enough to keep us in the Premier League, I am not particularly fussed.\n\nHowever, therein lies the problem.\n\nAs a fan, I was excited to see who the board would call upon to rescue our season.\n\nI appreciate the options were limited, given we needed someone who was available on a short-term basis mid-season, but this was also a priceless opportunity to unite an increasingly apathetic fanbase.\n\nIf we are to play our part in redeeming this season, we need to feel invested in our team.\n\nHopefully Tudor can win us over by inspiring – or scaring – the players into delivering something we have been missing so far in this campaign: football that is worth watching.\n\nGet us scoring some goals, winning some games, and keep us in the league.\n\nThen we can bring home everyone's favourite Argentine in the summer and forget this sorry season ever happened.\n\nFind more from Ali Speechly at Women Of The Lane and on Instagram",

    "description": "FC Bayern is keen on bringing the young star to Bavaria, which would be scary hours for the rest of Europe.",
    "fullText": "Bayern Munich currently houses the world’s best wing duo in Olicho.\n\nLuis Diaz and Michael Olise are undoubtedly the best wing pairing at the moment, with unstoppable dribbling, an incredible knack for finding teammates in open pockets of space, and a knack for scoring the most spectacular goals. One could make career highlight reels for both players from just the goal contributions this season. That is how they’ve both been playing.\n\nOlise’s 13 goals and 25 (!!) assists and Diaz’s 19 (!!) goals and 15 assists across all competitions this season are staggering enough… however, this still doesn’t paint the full picture. Both players have an insane gravitational pull, easily taking out 2-3 players from the equation in every play, creating loads of space for teammates to run into to fashion goal-scoring opportunities. And now Bayern might be ready to bring in another player with a crazy gravitational influence of his own: Yan Diomande.\n\nAccording to a tweet from Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano), FC Bayern and top Premier League clubs will battle it out for Diomande’s services in the summer. RB Leipzig is “yet to decide on a final price tag, but Bayern are keen, and Vincent Kompany also appreciates Diomande.” He ends the tweet with “Premier League clubs are also very keen,” which could imply that Premier League clubs outside of the usual suspects may also be deeply invested in this story.\n\nIn short, it is probably safe to assume that Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham Hotspur are all interested. Maybe even add Aston Villa and Newcastle in there for good measure.\n\nFlorian Plettenberg of Sky (@Plettigoal) tweeted that “Nothing has changed,” and that, “FC Bayern are still involved, staying in contact with the new management and monitoring the situation closely”. He then confirms that there is, “Nothing advanced yet,” and that “in the end, it will come down to the price,” which is understandable, since Leipzig is probably okay with the sale if they could get a huge chunk of change for the star winger. Ominously, he also adds that “All the top Premier League clubs are heavily involved.”\n\nOne thing is for certain: footballing giants are ready to have a go at one another for Diomande’s services. The player is a true diamond, cutting into defenses and using his flair and finesse to create chances from tight spaces. He would complement the duo of Diaz and Olise beautifully, and while he primarily plays on the left, he’s more than capable of being serviceable on the right, which makes him a fantastic player to add to the wing depth and/or rotation. This could also signal that Bayern is invested in developing Lennart Karl as a number 10, but I digress.\n\nYan is shining bright like a Diomande right now, and the sky is the limit on his trajectory.\n\nHopefully that trajectory involves a successful stint at Bayern Munich.",

    "fullText": "The Leasing.com Stadium hosts a historic FA Cup encounter on Monday night as National League North side Macclesfield look to claim another high-profile scalp against Premier League high-flyers Brentford.\n\nThe Silkmen arrive in scintillating form, having secured six wins from their last seven league games while netting a remarkable 22 goals in that span. John Rooney’s side has already etched its name into competition folklore this season by eliminating holders Crystal Palace in the third round—the biggest upset in FA Cup history by league position.\n\nStanding in their way is a Brentford team that has defied preseason expectations to sit seventh in the top flight. Fresh from a hard-fought 1–1 draw with leaders Arsenal on Thursday, the Bees aim to navigate a “trap” fixture and reach the fifth round for only the second time in 19 seasons.\n\nVenue: Leasing.com Stadium, Macclesfield\n\nJohn Rooney remains without star forward Danny Elliott due to a knee injury. Midfielder Josh Kay is also unavailable as he serves a suspension for accumulating yellow cards. The Silkmen will rely on the attacking prowess of D’Mani Mellor, who has scored seven goals in his last seven outings, and former Manchester City prospect Isaac Buckley-Ricketts.\n\nKeith Andrews is expected to rotate his squad following a demanding week in the Premier League. Talisman Igor Thiago is likely to be rested, potentially handing a debut to 19-year-old Kaye Furo. Captain Nathan Collins could return to the starting XI after being an unused substitute in recent matches. Kevin Schade remains sidelined through suspension, while Fábio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries from long-term injuries.\n\nThe Silkmen have turned the Moss Rose into a fortress, taking 33 points from a possible 48 at home this season. Notably, Macclesfield have won three consecutive FA Cup matches this term. If they secure a win tonight, they would be the first team to win four in their debut season (from the first round) since Rangers in 1886. Their attack remains clinical, averaging over three goals per game in their last seven league matches.\n\nThe Bees arrive as heavy favourites but must overcome a difficult non-league test. Notably, top-flight teams have progressed from 26 of 28 FA Cup fourth-round ties against non-league opponents. This is Brentford’s first-ever FA Cup match as a top-flight side against non-league opposition. Despite a demanding schedule, Brentford have shown defensive resilience, keeping a clean sheet in their 2–0 third-round win over Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nMacclesfield Predicted XI: Dearnley; Fensome, Menayese, Heathcote, Lacey; Edmondson, Dawson, Duffy, Buckley-Ricketts; Bughail-Mellor, Mellor\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Valdimarsson; Hickey, Collins, Pinnock, Henry; Yarmolyuk, Henderson, Damsgaard; Donovan, Furo, Nelson\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports 1 and TNT Sports Ultimate. Coverage begins at 19:00 GMT.\n\nRead more- Madueke urges Arsenal fans to ‘get excited’ about trophy chase\n\nSee Also- Longstaff hails ‘massive’ Leeds teammate after ‘tough time’\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "Premier League Wolves edge League Two Grimsby in an \"old school cup tie\" which provided an FA Cup \"throwback\".",
    "fullText": "It was, undeniably, an \"old school cup tie\" - one which both managers agreed provided \"a bit of a throwback\".\n\nThe pitch at Blundell Park was already a quagmire before kick-off between League Two Grimsby Town and Premier League Wolves, and rapidly deteriorated under relentless rainfall on the east coast.\n\nThe ball travelled unpredictably across the sodden surface. Players continued to slide for longer than expected. The pitch markings blurred in the mudbath.\n\nIt would be an understatement to suggest the conditions did not aid either team's ambitions of playing attractive football.\n\nBut they did produce fascinating scenes reminiscent of a bygone era, encapsulating the essence and charm of the FA Cup's history.\n\nThere would be no giant-killing here, however. Despite Grimsby's best efforts to test the visitors' resolve, top-flight strugglers Wolves squeezed into the fifth round by scoring from their only shot on target.\n\n\"It was a proper traditional old school cup tie,\" Grimsby boss David Artell told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It was going to be a fine margins game and that's how it was - we limited a Premier League team to one attempt on target and it's gone in.\n\n\"One chance, one goal for them. It showed how well we played in terrible conditions.\n\n\"The conditions made the game in some respects because it was a bit of a throwback.\"\n\nWolves edge past Grimsby on mudbath to reach fifth round\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards will take great encouragement from the gritty nature of his side's victory as they put their league struggles aside to reach the competition's last 16.\n\nThe 43-year-old reiterated to his players the importance of approaching their trip to face fourth-tier opposition with the right mentality, but his words could scarcely have prepared them for the messy reality on the ground.\n\nIndeed, for some of the Wolves players, this was a brutal introduction to the sort of tie which the FA Cup is famed.\n\n\"It was cold, wet, muddy and difficult conditions, but the lads did really well,\" Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It's mad, I quite enjoy these conditions. But there are not many lads in the dressing room who have seen the lower leagues in England.\n\n\"We go out every game to try and win. Our league form has not been great but a cup run would be unbelievable for us and the fans. Hopefully we can keep going and see where it takes us.\"\n\nWhile Wolves have managed just one win after 26 games in their dismal Premier League campaign, back-to-back FA Cup wins against League Two opponents has extended their cup interest into March.\n\nEdwards will hope the competition can yet provide some joy to supporters with relegation to the Championship seemingly inevitable - however the victories come.\n\n\"It was an aggressive game of headers and volleys,\" joked Edwards, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"They were really difficult conditions for both teams. It was a different type of game and a bit of a throwback.\n\n\"It was an eye-opener for a lot of the players when we arrived, the wind was sideways and there were puddles on the pitch.\n\n\"It was never going to be a day for beautiful football. We played with realism, we showed spirit and fight. We did the basics well and came through.\"\n\nEdwards added: \"It was all set up for a cup upset. We talked a lot about mentality over the past few days and the players showed a real desire to win.\"\n\nEdwards' players will have to adapt to a very different challenge on Wednesday, when they trade the Blundell Park mud for hosting Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\nFor Grimsby boss Artell, a \"bowling green\" surface much closer in quality to the one his side stunned Manchester United on in the League Cup earlier this season would also have been preferable.\n\nThe Mariners, on a 10-game unbeaten run stretching back to December, were full of confidence as they targeted another huge upset but were unable to capitalise on their late chances.\n\n\"From my side, we much prefer to play on a better pitch,\" Artell told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We have limited a Premier League side to one shot on target. I don't think either side did enough to win the game, but those are the fine margins.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Martin Odegaard was introduced from the bench in Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Brentford in midweek, but he was ultimately unable to inspire his side to victory. Upon entering the pitch, he made an immediate impact and helped the Gunners take the lead against determined opposition.\n\nThe match carried added significance after Manchester City had secured victory in their own fixture the previous day, increasing the pressure on Arsenal to respond with three points. The Gunners pushed to extend their advantage, fully aware of the risks associated with a narrow 1 0 scoreline. Despite their efforts, they were unable to find a second goal to put the contest beyond doubt.\n\nBrentford, known for their resilience, capitalised and scored the next and decisive goal of the match. Arsenal continued to search for a late winner and created opportunities in the closing stages, yet they failed to convert their chances and were forced to settle for a single point. With the season approaching its conclusion and Manchester City close behind in the title race, it was not the result Arsenal would have hoped for.\n\nOdegaard addressed the outcome in his customary programme notes before a home fixture. As reported by Arsenal Media, he wrote, “We were looking strong but then the game changed again. Brentford played to their strengths and made it hard for us, as they have done to many teams all season. We needed to carry on playing how we had been before we scored the goal, so it was frustrating that we couldn’t do that. We should have been better at not conceding too many set pieces and throw ins, and then we need to do better when the ball comes into the box – myself first.”\n\nMartin Odegaard v Brentford. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nHis remarks explain the fine margins at this stage of the campaign. Arsenal remain in contention, but with Manchester City maintaining close pursuit, every dropped point carries significant weight in the battle for the Premier League crown.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.

The North Londoners lead the Premier League by four points, while Arsenal will also meet Manchester City in the League Cup final in March. Now, the Gunners focus on FA Cup action and the visit of Wigan to the Emirates Stadium.\n\nThe Latics are 22nd in League One amid a tough campaign and are winless in their last eight league games.\n\nMikel Arteta must manage his squad with Arsenal’s absentees increasing in recent days. Kai Havertz has suffered a fresh injury setback and is set for another spell on the sidelines, where he joins Mikel Merino, who is facing five months out.\n\nWilliam Saliba missed the midweek draw at Brentford through illness and remains a doubt, while Martin Odegaard sustained another knee knock. Max Dowman also remains out with an ankle issue.\n\nExpect Arsenal to rotate their side for this one. Gabriel Martinelli, who hit a hat-trick at Portsmouth in round three, will hope for another outing from the start. Fellow forward Gabriel Jesus should also come in, allowing Viktor Gyokeres a rest.\n\nArsenal predicted XI: Kepa; White, Mosquera, Calafiori, Lewis-Skelly; Norgaard, Rice, Eze; Madueke, Jesus, Martinelli.\n\nArsenal vs Wigan Athletic will kick off at the Emirates at16:30 GMT on Sunday 15th February 2026.\n\nThe game is being broadcast on TNT Sports 1 and discovery+ for UK viewers.\n\nRead – Premier League Awards: Anxious Arsenal and Sesko’s stunner\n\nSee more – Premier League Team of the Week – Bogle, Hannibal, Semenyo\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are interested in signing Wolves attacker Mateus Mane.\n\nThe 18-year-old is highly rated in the Premier League, and he has impressed with Wolves this season. Mane has 7 goals and 6 assists in all competitions this season.\n\nManchester United are looking to add depth to the attacking unit and believes the 18-year-old could be ideal for it in the long term. Manchester United are monitoring him closely and could make a move at the end of the season.\n\nThe player is valued at £50 million as per Fichajes, and it remains to be seen whether Manchester United are prepared to pay up. It is a steep price to pay for a young player who is still largely unproven at the highest level.\n\nMeanwhile, the player is also a target for Liverpool. They have already held talks with the player and his representatives. Manchester United need to act quickly if they want to beat their rivals to his signature. The 18-year-old is a promising young player with a bright future, and he could justify the £50 million investment in the long run.\n\nMan Utd given boost in the race for £35m EPL star who could link up with McTominay\n\nMan United eye blockbuster move for £50m wonderkid, but Liverpool could ruin their plans\n\nMan United ready to sign £35m game-changing utility man with 13 assists\n\nMan Utd given boost in the race for £35m EPL star who could link up with McTominay\n\nMateus Mane of Wolverhampton Wanderers walks over to take a corner. (Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nHe will add explosive pace, flair, and goals in the final third. Manchester United need more depth on the flanks, and the young attacker could be the ideal fit for them. Wolves are likely to go down at the end of the season, and the 18-year-old will want to compete at a higher level. The opportunity to join Manchester United or Liverpool will be exciting for him.\n\nLiverpool need more quality on the flanks as well, and they have already taken initial steps to sign the player. It will be interesting to see where the young attacker ends up.\n\nMan United ready to sign £35m game-changing utility man with 13 assists",

    "description": "Burnley manager Scott Parker is under increasing pressure as the Premier League side are dumped out of the FA Cup by League One Mansfield.",
    "fullText": "League One Mansfield produced an FA Cup fairytale to remember at Turf Moor on Saturday, but for Premier League strugglers Burnley, it was another afternoon to forget.\n\nLouis Reed's 80th-minute free-kick into the top corner of the Clarets' goal was a cue for 3,500 travelling Mansfield fans to erupt in sheer delight.\n\nFor the home faithful, it had the opposite affect - boos and jeers started coming from large sections at Turf Moor, and at full-time it became a cacophony of discontent.\n\nWith just two wins in their past 19 games in all competitions and nine points adrift of safety in the Premier League, an FA Cup run represented the last bit of hope in what has been a dismal return to the top flight.\n\n\"The pressure is on Scott Parker from a certain section of the Burnley fans, they think his time is up,\" Chris Sutton said on BBC Final Score.\n\nThe teams immediately around Burnley in the Premier League table have all changed their managers this season. Could they be next?\n\nLosing to the team 13th in English football's third tier represents a new low in Burnley's season just as renewed optimism was starting to creep in.\n\nTheir remarkable 3-2 comeback win at Crystal Palace on Wednesday was their first victory in 16 Premier League games. The gloom started to lift slightly.\n\nParker's side showed real fight and spirit at Selhurst Park, which made his decision to make nine changes to his team for the visit of Mansfield all the more baffling.\n\n\"When you don't go through to the next round there will always be questions asked about that [team selection] but I don't think that was the main factor today,\" Parker told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We lacked a little something in those final moments. That was where we have fallen way short today.\"\n\nBurnley are not the first, nor will they be the last, Premier League side to ring the changes for a cup game against lower opposition.\n\nBut having been dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Cardiff City back in September, the FA Cup was the supporters' only chance to distract themselves from looming relegation.\n\n\"It is embarrassing, the changes he made. Play your strongest team. He made nine changes, and the second half was embarrassing,\" former Burnley defender David Unsworth said on BBC Radio Lancashire.\n\n\"It is an embarrassing afternoon for Burnley. It gives the owner a decision to make now. He has to listen to the fans, they are not happy.\n\n\"For the first time I have witnessed all home ends of the stadium booing and disgruntlement. The owner has a decision to make.\"\n\nChairman Alan Pace, the leader of the club's owners ALK Capital, is not the most popular at Turf Moor either at the moment.\n\nThis week he angered fans when, during an interview with BBC Football Focus, he dismissed fan concerns as coming from those who \"just play this game on a computer somewhere\".\n\nHe went on to liken those same fans to three-year-old toddlers having a tantrum.\n\nPace used Saturday's programme notes to clarify his words, writing: \"I did not intend for my words to upset, but I did mean what I was trying to say which was that, just because some are upset, does not mean that things are dire and without hope.\"\n\nMany Burnley fans will be hoping Pace calls time on Parker's spell in charge, though the former Premier League midfielder said he is confident is his own position at the club.\n\n\"I am very comfortable in my position at this present moment in time. We have lost a game of football today against a team we should be beating,\" Parker told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We had numerous chances. Of course you are always going to judge a result and today is a bad one, we take the flak for that, the team and myself.\"\n\nLeague One Mansfield shock Burnley in FA Cup\n\nWhile Burnley's failures were significant, it's important not to underplay Mansfield's achievement.\n\nThe Stags have eliminated a top-flight side from the FA Cup for the first time since February 1969, and will now play in the fifth round for the first time since 1974-75.\n\nDespite falling behind early on, Nigel Clough's side dug deep and hung in - Kyle Knoyle's heroic goalline clearance at 1-0 was typical of their spirit.\n\nWhen their chances came, they took them. Rhys Oates headed in the equaliser shortly after the break, before captain Reed produced a free-kick his club's fans will never forget.\n\n\"As soon as it left my boot I felt it going in. I have been working on them throughout the week. The lads said, 'This is your moment, go and take it'. Thankfully, I did,\" said Reed.\n\n\"It shows what a group we have got. The draws we keep getting are big ones. I felt we were always in the game even when we were 1-0 down at half-time.\n\n\"I think it's a cliche, whoever we get in the next round, we will go into that with the same energy as this one.\"\n\nSutton said: \"It's an amazing story and Nigel Clough, at the helm, has done a brilliant job at Mansfield.\n\n\"To think Mansfield came from behind against Premier League opposition, they kept on peppering Burnley's goal, but the free-kick from Louis Reed deserves to win any cup tie.\"\n\nWin a cup tie it did - but it could also end up costing Parker his job.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Arsenal lead Manchester City by four points at the top of the Premier League table, yet many of the Gunners’ supporters remain uneasy. In recent seasons, City have dominated the title race, with themselves and Liverpool sharing the championship between them since 2018.\n\nLiverpool, despite being the defending champions, has not matched their usual standards this term, which has strengthened the perception that this could finally be Arsenal’s season. The Gunners have placed themselves in a strong position and will be determined to ensure they capitalise on the opportunity.\n\nIn previous campaigns, Arsenal have fallen short in decisive moments, and their recent reduction to a four-point advantage has heightened anxiety among some supporters. With 12 matches remaining, the margin for error is slim, and any dropped points could quickly shift the balance of the title race.\n\nThe players at the Emirates Stadium understand the importance of maintaining focus and composure. Consistency, discipline, and mental resilience will be essential if they are to convert their current position into a league triumph. The closing stages of the season often test a squad’s depth and resolve, particularly when facing a rival with Manchester City’s experience and pedigree.\n\nPep Guardiola has acknowledged the psychological dimension of the title race. Speaking via Metro Sports, he said:\n\n‘I would prefer to be in the position Arsenal are in than our position.\n\n‘If I would be in the position with four points in front of second, with 12 games left, I would not be relaxed. Imagine being four points behind, I am less relaxed.\n\n‘I would still prefer to be in the position Arsenal are in than we are.’\n\nGuardiola’s comments underline the tension on both sides of the contest. While Arsenal hold the advantage, Manchester City’s pursuit ensures the race remains intense. The coming weeks will likely determine whether the Gunners can withstand the pressure and secure the title ahead of their closest challengers.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS! Anyone who would like to contribute an Article or Video opinion piece on JustArsenal, please contact us through this link…\n\n“I would not be relaxed” Guardiola playing mind games with Arsenal\n\nArsenal star expected to drop to the bench for his loan club\n\nLiverpool is leading Arsenal in the race for Premier League forward",

    "fullText": "Guglielmo Vicario could depart Tottenham at the end of this season, with a return to Serie A appearing increasingly likely. The Italian goalkeeper has impressed since arriving at the club, earning praise for producing a series of outstanding saves across numerous fixtures.\n\nDespite Tottenham’s inconsistent form, Vicario has remained one of their most reliable performers. His displays have attracted attention from several leading clubs, and the North London side may find it difficult to retain him if their struggles persist. While the Lilywhites would prefer to keep a player who has stood out amid challenging circumstances, the conclusion of the campaign may prompt a decisive development regarding his future.\n\nJuventus are understood to be keen on strengthening their squad with his addition. His experience in the Premier League is believed to have convinced them that he possesses the qualities required to thrive in their system. A return to Italy could hold particular appeal, especially given the prestige associated with representing Juventus.\n\nHowever, the Bianconeri are not alone in their pursuit. According to Tuttojuve, Inter Milan is also interested in securing Vicario’s signature. The Nerazzurri reportedly regard him as a strong candidate to reinforce their goalkeeping department and are prepared to rival Juventus in any potential move.\n\n(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)\n\nInter are said to be considering him as a possible replacement for their current first-choice goalkeeper, with the end of the season viewed as an appropriate moment to initiate change. Such competition would inevitably complicate negotiations and increase the pressure on Tottenham to clarify their position.\n\nVicario’s consistent performances have enhanced his reputation, and interest from major Serie A clubs underlines his growing stature. As the season approaches its conclusion, his next decision could shape not only his own career trajectory but also the strategic planning of the clubs seeking his services.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have been widely tipped to secure the Premier League title by the end of this season, and their performances in Europe have also positioned them among the favourites to win the Champions League. Since returning to the competition, the Gunners have made a significant impact, reaching the semi-final last term before losing to eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nTheir European pedigree has strengthened this campaign further. Arsenal defeated Real Madrid on their way to the semi-finals previously, underlining their ability to overcome elite opposition. This term, they have maintained outstanding form by winning all their league phase matches, reinforcing the belief among supporters that they can go all the way.\n\nDespite their consistency, Arsenal are fully aware of the challenges that lie ahead in the latter stages of the tournament. The Champions League remains fiercely competitive, with several heavyweight clubs still in contention. While their domestic and continental form has raised hopes of an unprecedented quadruple, the calibre of opposition makes such an achievement extremely demanding.\n\nSupporters remain optimistic, encouraged by the team’s resilience and tactical maturity under Mikel Arteta. However, experience suggests that decisive moments against Europe’s most established sides will determine whether Arsenal can convert promise into silverware.\n\n(Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nDidi Hamann has identified Bayern Munich as the side most capable of halting Arsenal’s progress. Speaking as reported by the Metro, he said, ‘Usually in the past, Bayern have always got the better of Arsenal.\n\n‘So, I think that was one of the reasons why Arsenal was desperate to show them, you know, this year is our year.\n\n‘Bayern have dropped a few points in the last two weeks. Against Hoffenheim, there was an early sending off, and Hoffenheim hit the crossbar and had three clear cut chances. They should have been ahead at half time.\n\n‘So Bayern Munich are not firing as they did in the autumn. But if they do get back to their form, I would favour Bayern Munich over two games.\n\n‘But it would be a fantastic game because obviously the first game was breathtaking.’\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.

    "fullText": "We need to accept that Liverpool are not in the running to retain their Premier League title.\n\nIt looks like Arsenal will contest the title with Manchester City - with the Reds very much stuck in the fight for Champions League football.\n\nIt’s been a difficult season for Arne Slot - who has been unable to get any kind of consistency out of the league champions. The head coach has also struggled to integrate £450m worth of new signings - and he has been dealing with significant injury troubles.\n\nPoor results have left the Anfield side fighting it out with Chelsea and Manchester United for a Champions League place - with Aston Villa even further ahead in the table.\n\nIt’s overwhelmingly likely that fifth place will be enough to secure a return to the Champions League due to England's coefficient - bringing with it potentially over £100m of participation fees, prize money and broadcast revenues.\n\nIt’s money that Liverpool cannot afford to live without - but there is every reason to believe that the club are about to take a decisive step towards securing it.\n\nThis midweek round of fixtures saw rivals Man Utd and Chelsea slip up - encountering draws against West Ham and Leeds respectively.\n\nAs a consequence the Reds have been able to claw back two more points in the race to gain a top-five finish courtesy of their 1-0 win up in Sunderland.\n\nAround the corner is a very winnable run of fixtures - and Arne Slot needs to be aiming to win 15 points out of the next 15.\n\nFirst of all across their next three league fixtures Liverpool will play three of the current bottom four. Crisis club Nottingham Forest are in 17th - and beyond the Tricky Trees away Liverpool will play West Ham (18) at home and Wolves (20) away.\n\nAfter that there are more bottom-dwellers in the shape of Tottenham (16) at home and Brighton (14) away.\n\nFollowing the Brighton game we will encounter the international window - with Liverpool facing Fulham (h), Everton (a) and Crystal Palace (h) in their subsequent three fixtures.\n\nMan Utd by contrast in their next five matches face only Crystal Palace who are currently in the bottom half of the table.\n\nBefore March is out they will play Everton (a), Palace (h), Newcastle (a), Aston Villa (h) and Bournemouth (a) - games they will not be looking forward to.\n\nAlthough Chelsea have got a gentle-looking game against Burnley coming up next at home after that they play two of the top three in succession - facing both Arsenal and Aston Villa away from home.\n\nBefore the international break they will play Newcastle at home and Everton away - by no means easy fixtures. Right after the break they will face Man City and Man Utd at home - meaning they are due to play every one of the top four in their next seven fixtures.\n\nRight now Liverpool fans are not so optimistic about making it back into the Champions League - particularly as they have to play Man Utd, Chelsea, Villa and Brentford in the run-in.\n\nBut there is every reason to believe that by the March international window the table will look very different - and Liverpool will have some breathing space in the chase for the rich prizes on offer in the Champions League.",

    "fullText": "\"Yet another bizarre appointment by the chairman.\"\n\n\"I don't get it... why not go for someone with a proven track record in the Championship?\"\n\n\"I cannot believe we are doing this again... a complete nobody with no experience in English football.\"\n\nHull City's decision to appoint Sergej Jakirovic as their new head coach in June last year was not met with much, or indeed any, enthusiasm from a number of fans.\n\nThe Tigers had just avoided relegation to League One on goal difference, one season after now Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior was sacked for only managing a seventh-placed finish.\n\nYet many were still surprised Ruben Selles was fired after keeping them up.\n\nHowever, Jakirovic and Hull have confounded expectations to sit just five points off the top two in the Championship.\n\nAs the former Bosnia international prepares to welcome Chelsea for a FA Cup fourth-round tie, how did the much-travelled 49-year-old end up leading an unexpected promotion charge in East Yorkshire?\n\n\"With a towering stature and steely gaze that could burn a hole through concrete, Sergej Jakirovic walked into the media suite at Hull City's MKM Stadium last summer and immediately commanded the attention of everyone in attendance,\" BBC Radio Humberside's Hull City reporter Mike White said.\n\n\"Based on that first impression, you'd be forgiven for thinking he was going to be a tough nut to crack for those of us in the media who'd be dealing with him all the time.\n\n\"However, it didn't take long for us to realise that first impressions aren't always the best way to judge someone.\n\n\"He's personable with an engaging sense of humour, intelligent, passionate and always forthright in his views.\"\n\nIt took a while for Jakirovic to made those first impressions count on the pitch as City made a mixed start to the season, with two wins, three draws and three losses in their opening eight league matches.\n\nA good run through October and November propelled them up the table but it was a 4-1 home reverse by Middlesbrough that built the platform for their move into promotion contention.\n\nAfter that defeat by Boro, Hull had conceded 34 goals from 19 games, the second-worst defensive record in the league.\n\nSince then they have let in just nine goals from their subsequent 12 games, with eight wins and six clean sheets in that run.\n\nThe Tigers are averaging 45% possession compared to 49% last season and making an average of 276 successful passes per game, 70 fewer than last time out.\n\nUnder Tim Walter and Selles last season the side scored two goals from what football statisticians Opta define as fast breaks - this season it's already nine.\n\nExperienced striker Oli McBurnie, who has scored 12 goals in 22 league appearances this season, said that the team are benefitting from the trust the manager and staff have in the players.\n\n\"It's not been like a dictatorship. Since they've come in they've understood what English football and culture is about,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"They will have a conversation with you. Obviously, the gaffer has the final decision but they've been brilliant.\n\n\"They understand the league and understand that we know the league and our opinions matter and having Dean [Holden] on the staff is massive for them.\"\n\nFriday, 13 February - 19:45 GMT\n\nWatch on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website and app; listen on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Humberside\n\nWhite agrees that Jakirovic's work has been built on solid foundations with sporting director Jared Dublin and head of recruitment Martin Hodge.\n\nHowever, against a backdrop of a lengthy injury list that at one point saw Jakirovic say he had 11 fit senior players, he believes the manager deserves \"a tremendous amount of credit\".\n\n\"It should be said that going into this season little was expected of a team working under a two-window EFL transfer restriction - only free signings and loans without fees were permitted - but the quality of recruitment has been nothing short of remarkable,\" said White.\n\n\"Adding to their challenges have been one serious injury after another to some of their key players like Oli McBurnie, John Lundstram, Joe Gelhardt and Mo Belloumi - a list that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the full injury crisis the club has found itself in consistently.\n\n\"Yet still they plough on, with a shot at the top two still a very real possibility - particularly given Coventry's recent downturn in form - so a return to the Premier League after nine years away shouldn't be ruled out.\n\n\"And Jakirovic deserves a tremendous amount of credit for steering it all in the right direction.\"\n\nJakirovic was born in to a football family in Mostar, then part of Yugoslavia, in December 1976.\n\nHis father Enver played as a goalkeeper for NK Neretva in modern-day Croatia and it was there that the Tigers boss began his own playing career.\n\nAcross 20 years he played as a defensive midfielder in Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Austria and also won five caps for Bosnia.\n\nA third generation of the family is now looking to make their way in the game - he gave a professional debut to his son Leon at Dinamo Zagreb when the latter was just 16 in May 2024.\n\nThe teenager moved on to Italian super club Inter Milan last month.\n\nAfter hanging up his boots, Jakirovic started his senior coaching career at Croatian second division side Sesvete in 2017 and then moved on to top tier side Gorica the following year.\n\nA brief spell with Slovenian champions Maribor followed before he guided Bosnian outfit Zrinjski Mostar to the title in 2021-22.\n\nHe returned to Croatia to take over at Rijeka in November 2022 but quit to replace former Liverpool midfielder Igor Biscan at Dinamo Zagreb in August 2023 and won the Croatian double that season.\n\nHowever, after becoming the first team to concede nine goals in a Champions League game, when they were demolished 9-2 by Bayern Munich, Jakirovic left in September 2024.\n\nTurkish strugglers Kayserispor appointed him as their boss in January last year and he led them away from relegation danger before making the move to England.\n\n\"When you look at Sergej's career he was successful everywhere he went,\" owner Acun Ilicali told BBC Radio Humberside in the summer after making Jakirovic his fifth boss since taking over in January 2022.\n\n\"He played the football at Kayserispor that I want to see my team play.\n\n\"When you look at his career he has the talent to make all his teams play similar games.\"\n\nDespite the early scepticism, it looks like this \"bizarre appointment\" could just be the perfect one.\n\nLatest Hull City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Hull City content on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains the key things a manager can do before, during and after matches to get the results they want.",
    "fullText": "I've talked a lot in this column about all the different work a manager does in trying to build everything you need in place at a club to be successful, but this week I want to talk about what happens around a game itself - before, during and afterwards.\n\nFor me, preparation for any game always started two hours after the one I had just managed.\n\nMy drive home to the south coast on a Saturday night after a game could take three hours or more, and much of that would be spent on the phone while I had precious quiet time.\n\nWhen I was at Stoke City, my chairman Peter Coates would always speak to me then if we lost. If we'd won, he never bothered, knowing I wouldn't need comforting.\n\nWin or lose, however, I would always ring my assistants, David Kemp and Gerry Francis, and we would discuss the game in finer detail - away from the stadium to give us a different perspective.\n\nThen I would contact my chief scout, who would have been at our next opponent's game, for a quick run-down of what he had seen - their shape, patterns, strength, weaknesses and any injuries.\n\nSunday was about spending all day with the family, but then either late on Sunday night or early on Monday morning I would be back up the motorway, with a clear view of what I believed was needed for our next game.\n\nThe players' week is always scheduled around the next game too. Monday was a light training session with the players who played on Saturday, and a debrief in a match-related game versus the reserves.\n\nThroughout my managerial career, I always wanted to show people I worked with what I wanted, and we would go through positives and negatives from Saturday live on the pitch.\n\nIf they needed it clarified then, whatever it was, it was sorted out in a game-related session on the grass. The players who hadn't started on Saturday stayed out afterwards, and had a much tougher morning.\n\nThis kind of work was always vital to me for us to get things right the following Saturday. Whether it was at Stoke, Crystal Palace or West Brom, I always recognised each team's strengths, and we all needed to be aware of the team's identity.\n\nYes, at each of those clubs we took different routes to get to our objective, but the aims - and challenges - were the same.\n\nHaving that clear identity and also a system that suits your players is paramount to success, but as a manager you also have to be confident and brave in leading and directing your strong personal views.\n\nPlayers will always test you, but will respect clarity and leadership if it stands firm under pressure. The reason I am mentioning this now, in respect to game days, is because it matters the most then.\n\nThe best example I can give is in the week before games against the very top teams I went overboard trying to exude confidence in my team and my tactics.\n\nIt didn't always work, but I believed that if they felt that from me, it would help them come the big day.\n\nAfter a full week of working on every player - drilling into each individual the understanding of their role in the team and how it would affect everything if he did not carry it off - I would then set about the ways we could hurt the opposition.\n\nObviously set-plays have now become a byword for how teams can do that successfully, but that was the case before me and it is the same now I have retired.\n\nAs well as attacking set-plays, defending them was something else we would work on. Whether it was in attack or defence, every individual knew his own personal challenge.\n\nOn the Saturday, I would turn up for a home game at about 11am, and in my early years I would also train myself before games.\n\nAt this stage, with only a few hours to go until kick-off, I would run through everything again and wait until the lads started to arrive. Once they were all settled, I would have a quick chat - nothing too rousing! - and then leave the dressing room.\n\nOnce the opposition teamsheet arrived, about 75 minutes before kick-off, I would check our markers against their players - this was important because I always man-marked!\n\nI would take that board into our dressing room, and out I would go again, until they arrived back from their warm-ups. Everything said from then on until the players left to start the game was confidence filling, with no negatives at all.\n\nThe actual team talk itself and the last things you said to the players could be very different depending on the occasion. It was not always me who gave it, either.\n\nAgain at Stoke, I got Ricardo Fuller up to speak right before our FA Cup semi-final against Bolton at Wembley in 2011.\n\nRic was such a great character and also a player with exceptional ability. Unfortunately he was injured and out of the game but he delivered a once-in-a-lifetime speech to the team, quoting Nelson Mandela.\n\nWe won the game 5-0 and to this day I am sure Ric believes his speech drove the lads to that famous result. The players would all tell you it certainly got them going.\n\nIt just shows you that the way to succeed in football management is not set in stone. You need tremendous resilience, yes, but also many more human strings to your bow.\n\nIn my early years at Stoke, we were always the underdogs, and the atmosphere was off the charts, never mind who we played.\n\nAs time went by and we became established, teams coming to Stoke were much more prepared for the experience, and our supporters became less reliant on our underdog status and rightly so.\n\nTo make up for this I began to use more psychological methods to generate the atmosphere in the dressing room that would help motivate the players.\n\nThat might mean mentioning recent comments or coverage that was negative towards us, or even bringing up stuff I had remembered from our early days at the club - anything that criticised us in any shape of form, that I knew would generate a positive response from the lads.\n\nThis method helped us greatly going into games we were expected to win.\n\nWhat you say at half-time is important too.\n\nI would always get two or three main points over about how the match was going, but you have to be careful what you say and do because the break can dramatically change the whole flow of the game.\n\nI've watched my team be really on it in the first half, then completely lose control of the game inside the first five minutes of the second half - and vice versa.\n\nIt's something all managers and coaches must be wary of, and I certainly was.\n\nI often tell the story of how Stoke were once 2-0 up at Blackburn at half-time and, as they were walking off the pitch, I just got a feeling a bit of complacency was setting in with our lads, who were patting each other on the back.\n\nSo, I decided to liven the dressing room up and picked on my captain Ryan Shawcross, who - by the way - had been absolutely outstanding that half. I gave him both barrels, and that left everyone extremely shocked.\n\nThe second half came and went with us seeing the game out and getting a deserved victory, but Ryan came to see me on the Monday - he was still pretty upset and did not know what had happened.\n\nI explained my reasons - I knew Blackburn boss Sam Allardyce would be after a big response from his lads in the second half, so to compensate for that I had to put everyone on edge.\n\nIt worked but, trust me, that was not always the case.\n\nAs a manager, you can obviously change things when the game is going on too.\n\nWhen I started in management, there was only one substitute permitted, but today you can change five players.\n\nThat's half of the outfield team that have started the game so, with squads so large now too, then it certainly can be a massive help to the coach.\n\nI look at the top teams' benches now and sometimes I can't believe the quality on there, which is something else that has changed in the past 30 years.\n\nMaking changes is always a pre-meditated option. Yes, I have taken players off for playing poorly, because we needed to hold on to a lead or were desperately trying to claw a goal back, but most of the time you have still got a plan.\n\nAs I've mentioned before when I talked about scouting players, the game has moved on to such an extent in the past 30 years that computers play a big part now in providing you with information.\n\nIt is the same during today's games too, to the extent computers on the side of the pitch can release certain data that can have an effect on a manager's thinking, either around individuals for substitutions or overall team analysis.\n\nI always trusted my own eyes, though. Although I have seen some fantastic advancements made with team analysis and individuals' live game data, I always backed my experience and judgement.\n\nOf course those decisions can have a huge impact if you get them right. I listen now to some commentators drooling over substitutions that change games, and what a genius the manager was to make those changes.\n\nWell, I have had those plaudits myself but, if the truth be known, I had picked the wrong XI to start with.\n\nIf I really was such a genius, I would have started with a different XI and got it right at the beginning.\n\nImmediately after full-time, I was always quick to move on, whatever the result.\n\nI would always explain to the players on Monday if I needed to get things off my chest about their performances.\n\nIt is always the manager who gets more of a grilling at full-time - many questions always followed the end of each Premier League fixture, with the agenda driven by the result.\n\nAs a manager, you are thrust almost immediately into the jaws of our unforgiving media and questions about tactics, substitutions and your team's overall performance are fired at you, sometimes under severe pressure.\n\nObviously the more damning investigations are aimed at the losing team's manager, where it is more than likely the questions are preordained.\n\nFor the winner, there are plaudits - but whatever the outcome, you have to think forwards not back.\n\nI was soon back in my car and heading home... thinking about the next match.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "fullText": "A whole host of players have been linked with a Merseyside move in recent months but one of the most intriguing rumours centres around Sandro Tonali, who is reportedly seeking a move away from Newcastle.\n\nNews broke on deadline day of the winter window that the Italian had been offered to Arsenal by his agent, but subsequent reports have suggested the Reds have opened talks to bring him to Anfield.\n\nThe 25-year-old has featured in almost every game for Newcastle this season but only featured from the bench in the Magpies recent victory over Tottenham.\n\nHaving made 70 Premier League and 28 Champions League appearances in his career, Tonali represents a ready-made option for Liverpool, but a deal will be incredibly complicated.\n\nLast summer saw Alexander Isak swap St James’ Park for Anfield in a British record transfer, but the deal will no doubt have left a sour taste in the mouth of his former employer.\n\nThe Swede went on strike, refusing to play for Eddie Howe’s side to force through a transfer – a move that obviously ruffled some feathers.\n\nNow, less than a year later, Liverpool are back in for one of Newcastle’s best players and the Isak saga will still be fresh in everyone’s minds.\n\nThe Reds aren’t the only team interested in Tonali, so a transfer away from the North East feels likely, but if the Italian chooses Liverpool as his next destination, it may be difficult for Newcastle to stand in his way.",

    "fullText": "Igor Thiago has reflected on his childhood watching Manchester United, which is where his love for football was first established.\n\nThe Brentford talisman chatted with TNT Sports ahead of his side’s clash with league leaders Arsenal last night.\n\nAfter being asked whether he’d always dreamed of being a professional player, he responded: “No, I didn’t even like it that much. But my brother started talking to me and made me watch the Premier League every weekend, especially Manchester United.\n\n“And then I started paying closer attention to United. From there it grew on me with feelings of love and affection. Then, I wanted to become a player too”.\n\n(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nWhile a striker addition isn’t United’s priority heading into the summer window, it’s certainly an admission that’ll have sparked the interest of INEOS chiefs.\n\nThiago is enjoying a tremendous campaign leading the Bees’ frontline – in a season in which they were widely anticipated to struggle in the absence of Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.\n\nHowever, they, as much as Keith Andreews might want to play down the prospect, are well in the mix for a European finish, and Thiago has been crucial to that.\n\nThe 24-year-old has netted a remarkable 17 goals in 26 matches, ranking him second-placed behind Erling Haaland in the Golden Boot race.\n\nHe has outscored costly summer signings such as Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike, both of whom are on 10 goals each, as well as Antoine Semenyo (13 goals), who moved from Bournemouth to Manchester City last month.\n\n(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nIn fact, United fans might recall that Thiago was on the scoresheet twice earlier this term when Brentford hosted the Reds at the Gtech Community Stadium back in September.\n\nHaving been injured for his team’s visit in 2024/2025, the Brazilian will experience Old Trafford for the first time in April, when United will be looking to avenge their 3-1 defeat, this time with Michael Carrick in the dugout.\n\nIn-form Premier League talisman says watching Man Utd with ‘love and affection’ made him want to be a player\n\nOwen fires warning to Man Utd that it’s going to be ‘nigh on impossible’ to replace star who could leave in summer\n\nMail: United ‘expected to make offer’ for £180k-a-week star with agreement now looking ‘increasingly likely’",

    "description": "Brentford 1-1 Arsenal: The Bees hit back against the Gunners, who lacked enough conviction in their play, meaning Man City are now just four points behind the Premier League leaders",
    "fullText": "Arsenal did the difficult part, but then faltered at what they’re supposed to be best at, making this title challenge that bit more testing. Except, much of that was down to Brentford. Keith Andrews’s side beat – or perhaps drew with – Arsenal at their own game.\n\nBrentford fully deserved Keane Lewis-Potter’s set-piece equaliser, and the 1-1 draw ultimately leaves Arsenal’s lead down to just four points.\n\nThey even looked likelier to win it at the end, Gabriel Martinelli’s late chance only came after Arsenal required crucial interventions from Cristhian Mosquera and Declan Rice.\n\nThat is why Brentford are still seen as one of the Premier League’s acid tests, perhaps even more testing than ever before. It is the most classic battle, the one teams have to really work through.\n\nFailing to win this fixture isn’t a sign you won’t win the title, but it’s a match that goes some way to showing your mettle and how you can really go through the gears in a title race.\n\nArsenal’s minimalism wasn’t enough here. It may end up serving as another warning.\n\nMikel Arteta will nevertheless be most frustrated that it should have been enough. Arsenal had the lead through Noni Madueke’s fine header, only for the team that normally shuts down games to see themselves opened up again and again.\n\nBrentford just forced them open. On conceding the goal, they immediately upped it in so many ways. It’s rare to see Arsenal so threatened on set-pieces.\n\nMaybe part of that was down to the absence of William Saliba.\n\nThe Gunners didn’t get going until it was too late in the game, allowing Brentford that margin.\n\nThat could be seen in the fact that they had just one shot in the first half, their lowest in an opening 45 minutes since a 5-0 thrashing to Manchester City in August 2021.\n\nIt is a balance that Arteta still has to figure out, as he too often leans towards control too often. The sense remains of a team trying to win the league on calculated probabilities rather than the true end product, of being so close now that the coach is now not taking enough risks.\n\nYou almost extend it to the expenditure.\n\nOne reason that Arsenal are where they are across all competitions is their squad depth, and yet there are moments when it’s hard not to wonder whether they could have used their budget in a slightly different way.\n\nThe starting attack in this game was a prime example. As good as Viktor Gyokeres and Madueke are in their own way, would the club have been better served pooling the money for both together, in the region of £107m, and going for one “killer”. An elevated star that they are still missing.\n\nEven Leandro Trossard, brilliant as he’s been for the club, often feels like he should be the impact sub rather than the starter.\n\nEberechi Eze was signed to offer that extra stardust, but it is going to be difficult to rise to the occasion when he is constantly in and out.\n\nAnd, after that first half, Arteta made the changes.\n\nMartin Odegaard was introduced. The Norwegian did have an initial impact, which helped force the opener.\n\nThere was a sense of what might have been.\n\nMadueke remains a tantalisingly frustrating player, as if there are still elements missing to complete his game. One is delivery.\n\nThere are so many occasions when he does wonders to beat his man, and often embarrasses them, only to try the same slowly floated cross that is so easy to defend against.\n\nHe perhaps saw the benefit of a more traditional effort on 61 minutes, which allowed the 23-year-old to show the productive player he often promises to be.\n\nArsenal’s changes had admittedly ensured that they were starting to pen Brentford in, with Odegaard looking especially lively.\n\nIt was his pressing that forced Andrews’s backline into an error, the ball then arriving at the feet of Piero Hincapie. He hooked over a fine cross, although one where Madueke looked like he might have stepped forward a touch too early. It was instead Caoimhin Kelleher who was wrong-footed, although only because Madueke showed impressive agility.\n\nThe winger arched back to loop a header across the goal and into the bottom corner.\n\nThat should have been that, only for Odegaard to then look a bit more culpable at the other end. He only stuck his leg out for one of Brentford’s aerial assaults, allowing Lewis-Potter to plunder a brilliant header.\n\nArsenal were lucky not to concede from that route again.\n\nBrentford are more than just an awkward team, or a physical one. There’s so much calculation in everything they do, as befitting a modern club built on analytics. You can almost see the science behind every move, the manner in which the ball is played into areas of probability.\n\nA favoured attack is one of the wingers immediately playing a first-time ball across the opposition area on the break, which tends to instantly cause angst.\n\nArsenal had to be on their toes, from start to especially raucous finish. The end of the game had a lot of football in it, particularly in a helter-skelter stoppage time. David Raya had already offered one of the saves of the season from Igor Thiago and had to be constantly alert as a relentless Brentford just kept roaring forward. The home side could have won it at least twice in the closing stages, Arsenal once.\n\nThose late blocks may prove important to Arsenal in another way. It may end up a good point in the grander scheme of things. Rather than such one-off moments, though, Arteta and his staff will be looking at those two lost points.\n\nIf Arsenal wanted more, however, they should have done more.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): We are struggling for goalkeepers this week, if I'm being totally honest. However, to play how he played against Arsenal and make a critical save right at the end was huge. The save against Gabriel Martinelli was probably the deciding factor that got him into the team.\n\nLamare Bogarde (Aston Villa): If you looked purely at stats, you would have said Aston Villa should have absolutely thrashed Brighton...except they didn't. It was a Brighton team that played very, very well and Bogarde stood up to the task at right back. He's a midfielder by trade so to see him playing right-back - which he has done a few times this season - was fantastic.\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool): Obviously gets the goal, but up at Sunderland - that wind, that crowd and the pitch was really poor - the ability to be a class above everyone else. He made sure Liverpool weren't really stretched. Defensively it was all Virgil van Dijk.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City): He looks like he's been playing for Manchester City for about eight years. Solid, composed, wonderful on the ball - he's just fitted in seamlessly. He helped City to a clean sheet in a 3-0 win against Fulham. He kept Fulham right at arm's length. Very, very good, for me.\n\nBashir Humphreys (Burnley): Probably one of the best performances of the week, and for him this season. Very strong in a tackle, offered loads going forward and defensively solid.\n\nMateus Fernandes (West Ham): He's one of those players that looks like he would infuriate me, both to play with and against. He did all the ratty things really well. He's got high energy, he's young, talented and he's the heartbeat of the team. He gets caught up sometimes in silly moments, trying to buy fouls when he doesn't really have to. I thought it was his best performance for West Ham this season - a very mature performance.\n\nNico O'Reilly (Manchester City): I love seeing him play in midfield. He adds the legs and energy into City's midfield - and obviously he gets his goal there as well. I feel the more he plays in his natural position - with Rodri around him - he'll be a star, not only for Manchester City but England moving forward as well.\n\nJacob Ramsey (Newcastle): When Newcastle's midfield has been torn up because of injury or suspension in the last few weeks, he's quietly gone about his business. He's been excellent and made sure he delivers in terms of performances and now goals. I think he's a real steal for Newcastle.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): I'm going to give a sympathy vote to Cole Palmer. He was in there last week because he scored a hat-trick against Wolves - but this week: goal, assist, and is a level above everyone else - but what a miss that was. If he scores that goal, Chelsea obviously win the game. He's a shoo-in. That miss does put a little stain on it, but I thought his overall performance was miles better.\n\nJoao Pedro (Chelsea): He's flying! Everyone puts that down to Liam Rosenior, but I put it down to having Cole Palmer back. Being able to have a player that can play behind him, find the passes and allows him to link up and move around, is why you're seeing the best of him. I think that is five in five now for Joao.\n\nJorgen Strand Larsen (Crystal Palace): I've been very critical of his move to Crystal Palace. I thought they got a lesser player than Jean-Philippe Mateta, however he scored two goal. Palace didn't win, but he's off the mark. You have to say fair play, he did well.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): It was Manchester City's first opportunity in a while to play before Arsenal and pile the pressure on.\n\nPep Guardiola guided City to a 3-0 win against Fulham, dominated the game, took Erling Haaland off and rested him, and was in a position to have John Stones on the bench and not have to use him.\n\nRuben Dias was back, he got to rest Rodri, his rotation was good, and he will feel really strongly about being in a position to kick on for the rest of the season with all his players starting to come back.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "description": "Arsenal are four points clear at the top of the Premier League with 12 games to play - but will recent history repeat itself?",
    "fullText": "The pressure in the title race was always going to come for Arsenal, and maybe after the 1-1 draw at Brentford this is where it turns up a notch for Mikel Arteta's side.\n\nIt must be pointed out that they are in the best position of all clubs chasing the title, four points clear at the top of the Premier League and with just three losses all season. But with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City the side chasing them, that gap does not feel huge.\n\nPart of that is down to the fact that if Arsenal had beaten the Bees they would have been six points clear and had the chance to extend that to nine points with a win over Wolves next Wednesday, with the game taking place before Manchester City are next in action.\n\nAnother factor is that Manchester City have produced incredible runs of form to chase down titles in previous years and the Gunners have finished second for three successive seasons.\n\nWith 12 games to go, history does not favour Arsenal with their end-of-season form.\n\nIn the past five seasons, only on one occasion have Arsenal won 10 of their final 12 Premier League matches in a campaign.\n\nIn those seasons, the Gunners have never won more points in their final 12 games than the team that went on to win the title.\n\nLeaders Arsenal frustrated in draw at Brentford\n\nWith the noise around Arsenal and their history under Arteta when trying to win the title, the Gunners boss was asked if he needs to ensure that his side do not panic and remain focused on their task.\n\n\"That's what we have to do,\" he said. \"I mean we are going to be willing and preparing to win every single match and the only thing that we can do is focus on that and raise the levels collectively and individually to be better than the opponent every week.\n\n\"It's just the things that we have to do, that's the most important thing.\"\n\nBefore Manchester City's dramatic win against Liverpool on Sunday, it looked as though Arsenal would be nine points clear.\n\nBut after Erling Haaland's late penalty to secure the three points and their win against Fulham on Wednesday, the gap was reduced to three points and the pressure was put back on to the Gunners.\n\nWhen asked if playing after City is bringing a new pressure to his team, Arteta said: \"I don't think so, I think we played well after them a few times this season and we have won games.\"\n\nOf the 17 games in which Arsenal have scored first in the Premier League this season, the draw at Brentford was just the second time they have failed to win, along with their loss to Manchester United in January.\n\nMidfielder Declan Rice could not have put it better: \"This is a rollercoaster of a season.\n\n\"You can't be naive to think this is going to be easy. We are playing against the best teams week in, week out. We have to keep pushing and believing in ourselves, controlling the controllables.\n\n\"We have to block out the outside noise. We have done that really well. People are going to talk up the title race and Arsenal but we have a really calm group.\"\n\nThe Gunners came into this match without centre-back William Saliba, who missed out through illness.\n\nSaliba is a key part of this Arsenal side and his partnership with Gabriel Magalhaes is a big reason why they have conceded just 18 goals in the league this season.\n\nSince the start of 2022-23, Arsenal have a 68.6% win rate and average 2.3 points per game with Saliba playing in the Premier League (W83 D24 L14), compared to a 42.1% win rate and 1.6 points per game on average without him (W8 D7 L4).\n\nThe Gunners are also without Kai Havertz, who has picked up a muscle injury after only just returning from a long-term knee issue last month.\n\nAs well as those two changes, Arteta brought Viktor Gyokeres and Piero Hincapie into the starting XI at Brentford.\n\nBut the Gunners have only won two of the past seven Premier League games in which they've made four or more changes to their starting XI from the previous match (D4 L1).\n\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on TNT Sports: \"That's what people were shouting at me as I was coming off the pitch, 'Man City are coming to get you', but at the end of the day Arsenal are four points clear.\n\n\"You get knocked down, you get up again. Let's see who the fighters are and let's see who is going to win this. They could have put down a big marker if they won the match, but it never looked like that was going to be the case.\"\n\nIn two of their three second-placed finishes in recent years, Arsenal have finished behind Manchester City, which is why the talk about this title race carries so many emotional scars for supporters.\n\n\"What Man City have got is the know-how and the recent history behind them,\" Peter Crouch added on TNT.\n\n\"That can lead to nervous tensions around the stadium, certainly around the back end of the season.\n\n\"Having someone like Man City and Pep behind you, you are always going to be looking over your shoulder. But you would much rather be in Arsenal's position.\"\n\nCrouch believes Arsenal will never have a better chance to win the title.\n\n\"Man City are not the Man City of old, Liverpool aren't, Manchester United aren't what they have been, Chelsea the same,\" he said. \"There is a lack of quality in the top areas [of the league]. The bar has been set high in the past years.\n\n\"Now is a real opportunity for Arsenal. If they don't get over the line, there needs to be more questions answered.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Gerwyn Price ended Michael van Gerwen's unbeaten start to the Premier League by claiming a 6-3 victory in night two's final in Antwerp.\n\nVan Gerwen won the season opener in Newcastle last week and beat Luke Littler in the semis on his way to another final.\n\nBut the seven-time champion was no match for Welshman Price, who had come through two final-leg deciders before lifting the title in more comfortable fashion.\n\nLittler had earlier opened the tournament's first visit to Belgium by edging a final-leg decider of his own against rival Luke Humphries.\n\nFor Price it was a welcome victory to confirm the fine form he had been in of late.\n\n\"I think I'm playing some of the best stuff I've played, I'm just not winning tournaments,\" Price told Sky Sports after his victory.\n\n\"There's no way I can't win a major, bigger Pro Tours, Europeans. Averages are just for show and if you play well on your darts and win matches you win tournaments. I'm going to get some.\"\n\nThe PDC Premier League visited Belgium for the first time in the competition's 21-year history, and the 10,000 darts fanatics inside the AFAS Dome were treated to plenty of thrills.\n\nPremier League Darts 2026 fixtures, results and table\n\nPremier League: Price beats Van Gerwen to win Antwerp final - as it happened\n\nThe night started with a bang as the two biggest darts stars in the world played out a high-quality contest that went down to a final-leg decider.\n\nHumphries and Littler both hit seven 180s and averaged over 102 and 105 respectively, but both were surprisingly poor on the outer ring - missing 28 doubles between them.\n\nHumphries was the better player throughout, but at 4-1 up he started missing doubles badly, 17 in all by the end of the match, as Littler engineered an escape to make it five straight wins against his big rival.\n\nWorld number two Humphries has now lost 11 of his 15 Premier League meetings with Littler, with his last victory of any kind against the 19-year-old coming in the tournament's final last May.\n\nThe past four defeats before this one came in tournament finals, and perhaps it is becoming a mental barrier now for the defending Premier League champion as his scoring was solid all game, but he could just not get over the line.\n\nComebacks were a theme of the opening quarter-finals with all bar Van Gerwen's stroll against an out-of-sorts Josh Rock filled with excitement.\n\nStephen Bunting finished bottom of the table last year after failing to win a single match in the first eight weeks, but looked to have one sewn up when leading 4-0, only to watch Jonny Clayton reel off six straight legs to win 6-4.\n\nAnd Price had to come from 3-1 and 4-2 down to beat Gian van Veen in the first of his two 6-5 victories on the night.\n\nPrice's second final-leg decider came against good friend and Wales World Cup team-mate Clayton in a nip-and-tuck battle.\n\nPrice had four 180s to Clayton's three and averaged just over 100 - but was forced to win the final two legs under extreme pressure to make the final.\n\nIt was no real surprise given Price had won nine in a row against his compatriot and 15 of their past 16 meetings.\n\nVan Gerwen did not impress in his opener but certainly did in a strange 6-4 victory over Littler where seven of the 10 legs went against the darts.\n\nThe Dutchman averaged just over 100 with an off-colour Littler down at 95 and - strangely for him - only managing a single maximum, while Van Gerwen hit four.\n\nBut it was the finishing under pressure that made the difference as the Dutchman hit six of 13 attempts at a double, including finishing off a 10-darter, in a performance that was much more like the Van Gerwen of old.\n\nDespite incredible back-to-back finishes of 167 and 160 in the final Van Gerwen was always second best, but a win and a final after two nights is a great start considering he failed to win a single night in last season's competition.\n\nThe results also leave Littler and Humphries in fifth and sixth in the table with just one win each, but there is no panic just yet with 14 weeks of fixtures remaining.\n\nThursday, 12 February - FAS Dome, Antwerp\n\nLuke Littler 6-5 Luke Humphries\n\nMichael van Gerwen 6-2 Josh Rock\n\nJonny Clayton 6-4 Stephen Bunting\n\nPremier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night.\n\nEach of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.\n\nPlayers earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.\n\nThe top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.\n\nIf players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.\n\nThursday, 19 February - OVO Hydro, Glasgow\n\nStephen Bunting v Gian van Veen\n\nMichael van Gerwen v Luke Littler\n\nBunting/Van Veen v Humphries/Rock\n\nVan Gerwen/Littler v Clayton/Price\n\nBunting/Van Veen/Humphries/Rock v Van Gerwen/Littler/Clayton/Price",

The Portuguese manager was sacked by Wolves in November after failing to win a game all season.\n\nDespite a poor campaign this season, Pereira successfully saved Wolves from relegation last season, even though he took over the club when they were in 19th. This run included wins over Tottenham and a league double over Manchester United.\n\nThomas Frank (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nTottenham sacked Thomas Frank just one day before Sean Dyche was relieved of his duties as Nottingham Forest boss.\n\nThe Dane has only won two Premier League matches since October for Spurs, but boasts an impressive seven years as Brentford manager. In that time he took them from the Championship to Premier League regulars.\n\nMauricio Pochettino (Photo by Omar Vega/Getty Images)\n\nThe Argentine is currently manager of America and is likely to remain in that post until after the World Cup in the summer. However, after that he may be open to coming back to England.\n\nPochettino had a very successful spell at Tottenham, reaching the Champions League final and finishing second in the Premier League.\n\nSince then he has also managed Paris St. Germain where he won Ligue 1 and Chelsea reaching the League Cup final.\n\nRoberto De Zerbi (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nFormer Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi has also been linked with the job.\n\nDe Zerbi has now left the French club after a season and a half in charge, following group phase exit their Champions League. But he did record a second-placed finish in his first campaign in charge, and also guided the Seagulls into the Europa League during his time on the south coast.\n\nNOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND – JANUARY 29: Robbie Keane, Head Coach of Ferencvarosi TC, looks on prior to the UEFA Europa League 2025/26 League Phase MD8 match between Nottingham Forest FC and Ferencvarosi TC at City Ground on January 29, 2026 in Nottingham, England.

    "fullText": "Arsenal travel to Brentford on Thursday night, aiming to preserve their six-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nThe Gunners have moved into February with immense momentum, following four consecutive victories that have solidified their title charge. Manager Mikel Arteta oversaw a dominant 3–0 success over Sunderland last weekend, ending the day nine points clear before Manchester City’s late comeback at Anfield. Arsenal arrive in West London seeking a fourth consecutive clean sheet, a defensive feat they last achieved during a record-breaking streak in late 2024.\n\nMikel Arteta navigates fitness concerns regarding several key creative figures. Notably, a persistent hip injury keeps Bukayo Saka on the sidelines. Furthermore, Martin Ødegaard remains a major doubt after missing the last two matches with a minor muscle issue. Consequently, Kai Havertz likely retains his place in a deeper midfield role. Leandro Trossard adds to the headache; he limped off against Sunderland with a calf injury.\n\nDavid Raya starts in goal. Riccardo Calafiori likely features in the defensive line ahead of him, though Piero Hincapie offers a viable alternative. In midfield, Declan Rice and Martin Zubimendi aim to dictate the tempo. Up front, Viktor Gyökeres returns to the starting lineup. He scored twice off the bench last weekend. Gabriel Martinelli and Noni Madueke support him in a revamped attack.\n\nArsenal predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday, 12 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nLive television coverage will be available in the UK on TNT Sports 1.

    "fullText": "Premier League leaders Arsenal travel to the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday night, aiming to banish a peculiar midweek curse and maintain their six-point advantage at the top of the table.\n\nThe Gunners arrive in West London having “banished their January blues,” recording four consecutive wins across all competitions, including a clinical 3–0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday. However, Mikel Arteta’s side faces a historical hurdle: despite an impressive overall midweek record, Arsenal have failed to win—or even score—in any of their last three Premier League games played specifically on a Thursday. Standing in their way is a high-flying Brentford side that has emerged as the season’s “surprise package”. Under Keith Andrews, the seventh-placed Bees have won their last two matches, including a dramatic 3–2 triumph at St James’ Park last weekend.\n\nDate: Thursday, 12 February 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Arsenal 2–0 Brentford (2 Dec 2025), Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews remains without Kevin Schade, who serves the second of a three-match suspension for violent conduct. Reiss Nelson is ineligible to face his parent club, while long-term absentees Fabio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries. After a strong showing in Newcastle, the Bees are expected to remain largely unchanged, though Yehor Yarmolyuk is pushing for a start in midfield.\n\nMikel Arteta faces several late fitness calls. Bukayo Saka (hip) and Martin Ødegaard (muscle) both missed the Sunderland win and remain doubtful for the derby. Leandro Trossard is also a major doubt after sustaining a calf issue late against the Black Cats. However, Viktor Gyökeres is poised for a recall to the starting XI after his decisive brace off the bench last weekend.\n\nThe Gunners have maintained a high level of performance in local fixtures. Notably, Arsenal have lost just one of their last 23 Premier League London derbies (W17 D5). Defensively, they arrive in peak condition, having kept three consecutive clean sheets in all competitions heading into Thursday’s clash. However, the “Thursday curse” remains a concern, as the team has failed to score in their last three league outings on this specific day.\n\nThe Bees have turned their home ground into a nightmare for visitors. Notably, Igor Thiago has been in sensational form, netting nine goals in his last 10 home matches—a tally bettered only by Erling Haaland this season. Brentford also boast a clinical edge, with an xG per shot of 0.16, the best by any Premier League team in the last five seasons. While they are winless in eight against the Gunners, their current form suggests they are more than capable of an upset.\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Van den Berg, Ajer, Henry; Janelt, Henderson; Ouattara, Jensen, Lewis-Potter; Thiago\n\nArsenal Predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe match will be televised live in the UK on TNT Sports 1, with coverage starting at 19:00 GMT ahead of the 20:00 kick-off.

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest sacked manager Sean Dyche on Wednesday after a dismal draw with Wolves left them hovering above the Premier League relegation zone.\n\n\"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that Sean Dyche has been relieved of his duties as head coach,\" the club said in a statement on X.\n\n\"We would like to thank Sean and his staff for their efforts during their time at the club and we wish them the best of luck for the future.\"\n\nForest's 0-0 home draw with bottom club Wolves left them just three points clear of the bottom three.\n\nSpeaking after Wednesday's stalemate, a gloomy Dyche acknowledged his job was in peril, and that volatile owner Evangelos Marinakis could well decide to swing the axe.\n\nMarinakis has already sacked Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Postecoglou this season, and his patience once again wore thin after Forest drew a blank despite having 35 shots.\n\nDyche's team were booed off at the final whistle.\n\nDyche said he was a \"realist\" about his precarious situation and spoke like a manager resigned to his fate.\n\n\"The owner has been fair to me, without a shadow of a doubt,\" he said. \"If anyone chooses to change in football now, that's their decision. We've all seen it,\" he said.\n\n\"If the owner wants to make a change, then that's up to him, and that's the way football is now, that's just the reality of it.\n\n\"He's been absolutely fair with me from the beginning to the end, and I've been fair with him and told him the truth every step of the way.\"\n\nForest thrived under Nuno last season, securing a place in the Europa League, but the Portuguese coach was dismissed after falling out with Marinakis over transfers.",

    "description": "The Clarets' remarkable first-half fightback keeps alive their slim hopes of Premier League survival, but where does it leave Crystal Palace?",
    "fullText": "When Burnley fans first heard the news that their team bus had been caught up in traffic on the way to Selhurst Park – and that their game at Crystal Palace would be delayed by 10 minutes as a result – they may have been fearing the worst.\n\nAfter all, this was hardly ideal preparation for a team lying second bottom in the Premier League table, 11 points adrift of safety and without a win in their last 16 top-flight games.\n\nWith 12 minutes of the first half remaining, by which time Jorgen Strand Larsen's double had helped Palace breeze into a 2-0 first-half lead, the Clarets faithful will have been resigned to another bruising defeat, continuing their agonising slide back towards the Championship.\n\nTuesday's encounter had been following a familiar script. Parker's team had not only given away two easy goals, they had failed to register a shot on target in the first 39 minutes of the contest.\n\nThe seven that followed had to be seen to be believed.\n\nHannibal Mejbri made it 2-1 with his first goal of the season, before Jaidon Anthony arrowed a low shot into the corner to bring Burnley level four minutes later.\n\nBurnley's extraordinary comeback was complete in first-half stoppage time, when goalkeeper Dean Henderson parried Bashir Humphreys' header on to the foot of Jefferson Lerma and into the net to spark jubilant, almost disbelieving scenes in the away end.\n\nThis extraordinary result may prove too little, too late for the Clarets in their battle to avoid relegation.\n\nBut it was just the tonic for manager Scott Parker, who was subjected to chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'you're getting sacked in the morning' by his own supporters during last weekend's defeat by West Ham at Turf Moor.\n\n'Up to owner to make change' - Dyche under major scrutiny\n\nWill West Ham make 40-point mark crucial in relegation fight?\n\nHaving endured one of his toughest afternoons of his Burnley tenure on Saturday, Parker looked like he was trying to keep a lid on his emotions after Tuesday's astonishing victory.\n\nBut you could hear the fierce pride in Parker's voice as he spoke about his players' heroics in his post-match interview with TNT Sports.\n\n\"There aren't many teams who would come back here after going 2-0 down,\" he said. \"It speaks absolute volumes for this group.\n\n\"If there was ever any question about how together this group is, how committed this group is, how resilient this group is – [tonight] said it all, really.\"\n\nParker's team remain nine points adrift of safety with only 12 matches of the 2025/26 season left to play.\n\nBut neither Parker, nor his players have given up hope of mounting a late survival charge.\n\n\"There has always been belief [that we can stay up],\" he continued. \"The results over the last few months probably haven't gone our way, but tonight that definitely was the case,\" he said.\n\n\"Coming off the back of an incredibly tough game for us at the weekend – for many reasons – that performance showed a group that is full of resilience, full of commitment.\n\n\"You don't get that result without proper resilience, standing up to certain battles and certain situations. The biggest lesson for any group is to keep coming back up.\n\n\"We certainly did that tonight.\"\n\nSo where does Tuesday's result leave Palace?\n\nIn stark contrast to his opposite number, Oliver Glasner looked ashen-faced when he addressed the media after the full-time whistle, which was greeted by loud boos from the Palace supporters.\n\nHaving watched his team arrest a 12-match winless run against arch rivals Brighton last time out, Glasner looked set to mark his 100th match in charge of the club with another morale-boosting win after Strand Larsen's double.\n\nBut Palace froze after Mejbri had pulled a goal back for Burnley, who took full advantage of the hosts' inertia to inflict one of the most painful defeats of the Austrian's Selhurst Park tenure.\n\n\"It's not acceptable,\" Glasner, who is leaving the club in the summer, told TNT Sports. \"I can't explain it. Maybe [the first 39 minutes] were too easy.\n\n\"The start was very good. We controlled everything, [but] I've watched all the goals back and it's just not acceptable how we defended as a team – just jogging around, not in the duels, not in the second balls.\"\n\nAnother issue, according to Glasner, is the presence of a Marc Guehi-sized hole in the Palace defence.\n\nThe England defender left for Manchester City for an initial £20m last month in a move which incurred the wrath of Glasner, who announced his own departure not long afterwards.\n\n\"Right now, we don't have someone on the pitch who leads the team in these moments, who makes players calm and decides the meaning of the game,\" he said.\n\n\"I praise the boys very often for their effort. When you throw the game away like we did, you don't deserve to win.\"\n\nPalace are still eight points above the bottom three – a sizeable cushion, but one not comfortable enough for a side with only one win in all competitions since 11 December.\n\nDefeat at home to Wolves in their next league game really would set alarm bells ringing.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",
