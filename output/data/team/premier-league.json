    "fullText": "Liverpool’s recruitment work remains firmly ongoing, despite last summer delivering a Premier League title and a significant refresh of the squad. Credit must go to TEAMtalk for the original report, which sheds light on a familiar name continuing to feature prominently in the club’s forward planning.\n\nUnder Arne Slot, Liverpool have taken a measured and data led approach to squad building, but there is a clear sense that further evolution is required. While the collapse of a late move for Marc Guehi left some frustration, attention has now turned towards attacking depth, particularly on the left side of the frontline.\n\nInjuries have played their part in shaping January discussions, with Alexander Isak’s leg break limiting options across the front line. However, the lack of a natural replacement following Luis Diaz’s departure last summer has been evident for some time.\n\nCody Gakpo has shouldered much of the responsibility, with Rio Ngumoha also used in flashes, but Liverpool’s recruitment team are clearly exploring alternatives with greater consistency and upside. The left wing is viewed as an area where elite competition could raise the overall attacking level.\n\nAccording to TEAMtalk, Liverpool remain in regular contact with Paris Saint-Germain forward Bradley Barcola, a player who has been tracked for a considerable period. His situation in Paris remains uncertain, with negotiations over a new contract ongoing but no guarantees over his long term role.\n\nThe report states that PSG have ruled out a January exit, though the summer window could tell a different story. Valued at €69.6m (£60m) and under contract until 2028, Barcola is attracting interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City, underlining his standing across Europe.\n\nBarcola’s recent involvement at PSG has been limited, having “started on the bench for five of PSG’s last six league games, being an unused substitute twice.” That context matters. Liverpool will be monitoring whether this pattern continues under Luis Enrique.\n\nSlot can offer something compelling, a defined role, tactical clarity and the promise of regular minutes in a title challenging side. Richard Hughes and his recruitment staff are unlikely to force matters in January, but groundwork is clearly being laid should circumstances shift.\n\nFrom a Liverpool supporter’s perspective, this report feels quietly encouraging rather than headline grabbing. The key detail is not an imminent bid, but the fact that regular contact is being maintained. That suggests intent and patience, two traits that have defined Liverpool’s smartest recruitment cycles in recent years.\n\nBradley Barcola fits the profile many fans hoped for after Luis Diaz left. Young, technically strong, comfortable on the left and capable of stretching defences. Watching Gakpo adapt admirably has been positive, but there is room for another elite option who naturally thrives in wide areas.\n\nArne Slot’s system relies heavily on wide attackers who can receive between the lines and carry threat in isolation. Barcola looks well suited to that role, especially if offered trust and continuity. The idea that Liverpool could present him with a guaranteed place in the XI feels realistic rather than speculative.\n\nSupporters also appreciate the calm approach. There is no sense of panic buying, even with injuries disrupting plans. Instead, Liverpool appear content to wait for the right moment, trusting that situations like Barcola’s can evolve quickly.\n\nIf this one reaches the summer, optimism will grow. Liverpool staying close, informed and ready to move is often how the most successful deals begin.",

Generally the standard is quite poor.\n\n\"A focus on throw-ins can save the life of small clubs, as a technique to survive.\n\n\"But at the top of the league, it can help with a more fluent style of play.

Literally.\"\n\nWhile scathing of the effort of many of his own players, even Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche acknowledged something is stirring at Wrexham as they knocked his Premier League side out of the FA Cup.\n\nIn front of co-owner Ryan Reynolds, the Red Dragons' class of 2025-26 etched themselves into cup folklore by taking a top-flight scalp at the Stok Cae Ras on penalties - and with drama befitting their modern-day Hollywood association.\n\nTwice they were two goals clear against last year's semi-finalists before being dragged, exhausted, into extra time, where they produced a dramatic climax.\n\nFor a club with FA Cup upsets stitched into their fabric, this win was up there with the most climactic - and the hero of the iconic win over Arsenal in 1992, Mickey Thomas, watched on.\n\nBefore the match manager Phil Parkinson said he had wished to take on a Premier League team since the club's journey up from the fifth tier began five years ago.\n\n\"We highlighted to the lads some of the great moments in this club's history in the FA Cup and could we make our own bit of history tonight. We've certainly done that,\" Parkinson said.\n\nThey did, and then some - beating top-flight opposition for the first time since 1999 to progress into round four.\n\nBut Wrexham are getting used to writing their own scripts.\n\n\"It's not just about the money, the fame and the people involved who have been amazing in the whole story, but to keep that edge and keep pushing as they're doing is tremendous,\" Dyche said.\n\nAnd, with a nod to Wrexham's position just outside the Championship play-offs, having been a non-league side as recently as 2023, he added: \"They might well add to the story.\"",

    "fullText": "Liverpool’s pursuit of attacking reinforcements has taken another turn following confirmation that Antoine Semenyo will be heading to Manchester City. As Anfield Watch outline, this was a deal Liverpool clearly admired but ultimately could not land, prompting a familiar recalibration rather than panic. Under Arne Slot, recruitment remains measured, analytical and rooted in long term fit rather than short term noise.\n\nAs Anfield Watch note, “How keen and how serious the club’s interest was in comparison to Man City remains moot. We may never know how close Liverpool got to completing this deal, or just how far away they were from it.” That uncertainty defines much of modern Transfers, where even strong interest does not always translate into decisive movement.\n\nLiverpool’s admiration for Semenyo was well established. “They clearly like Semenyo, and have been wanting to add a similar profile to him for a while.” With that profile still a priority, attention has turned to a player long tracked by Liverpool scouts.\n\nAccording to Anfield Watch, “The club has added Kevin Schade to their shortlist for the summer window. The German international has been followed by Liverpool scouts for over five years now and back when he started to emerge as an exciting youngster at Freiburg, the Reds did already consider making a move for him.” That line speaks volumes about Liverpool’s recruitment philosophy, patient, informed and rarely impulsive.\n\nJurgen Klopp’s admiration for Schade’s style is also noted in the report, although the eventual move never materialised due to valuation concerns. Schade instead joined Brentford, where he has steadily developed into a key Premier League performer. Now 24, he is approaching his peak years with tangible output to match his raw attributes.\n\nSchade’s appeal lies not only in goals and assists but in traits that Liverpool currently lack in abundance. As Anfield Watch explain, “Predominantly a left-winger, Schade is very much of the Semenyo mould.” He is an inverted forward, capable centrally and across the line, offering tactical elasticity that Slot values highly.\n\nHis pace is striking. “During his first season in the league, Schade clocked in a top-speed of 36.37 km/h which was faster than the likes of Alphonso Davies and Erling Haaland in the Bundesliga.” That speed has translated to England, where “he has clocked in a top-speed of 34.8km/h for Brentford, which is the fastest for the club in the Premier League this season.”\n\nCrucially, Schade runs beyond defences rather than always demanding the ball to feet. “Right now, Liverpool don’t really have this kind of profile.” With Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah preferring play in front of defensive lines, Schade would stretch opponents vertically and horizontally.\n\nAnfield Watch conclude that Schade offers “a new element and new dimension to Liverpool’s attack.” That assessment feels accurate. His pressing, channel running and positional flexibility align neatly with Slot’s emphasis on speed and intensity. Added to that, “for most of his career in the Bundesliga, he played as a right-winger so he can play across the front three.”\n\nLiverpool rarely move without conviction. Schade’s presence on the shortlist suggests quiet groundwork already laid, positioning Liverpool well should summer opportunities arise.\n\nMissing out on Semenyo hurts in the short term, but the idea that Liverpool already have alternatives like Kevin Schade under serious consideration speaks to continuity in recruitment.\n\nSchade feels like a Slot player. Pace, pressing and positional intelligence are non negotiable under this regime, and the Brentford winger ticks those boxes. Fans have often called for more runners in behind, particularly against low blocks, and Schade’s speed profile directly addresses that gap.\n\nThere is also comfort in the timeline. Liverpool tracking him for over five years shows this is not opportunism but strategy. Supporters have seen how well that approach has worked with past Bundesliga imports. The concern, as ever, will be cost. Brentford sell hard and sell well.\n\nYet if Liverpool are serious about evolving the attack post title win, adding variety matters as much as adding goals. Schade might not arrive with fanfare, but he feels like the kind of signing that quietly raises the ceiling of the squad.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League has a habit of calling its own back. For Conor Gallagher, that call may arrive just 18 months after he left Chelsea for Atletico Madrid. According to reporting credited to talkSPORT, Aston Villa are exploring a deal to bring the midfielder back to England, potentially on loan with an obligation to buy. It feels like one of those stories shaped as much by timing as by tactics.\n\nGallagher is 25, soon to be 26, experienced but still with something to prove. Villa, meanwhile, are a club pushing against their own ceiling, chasing Champions League football and silverware under Unai Emery. That alignment matters.\n\nEmery’s long standing interest in Gallagher is key. He “has been keen to sign Gallagher since he was at Chelsea”, a line that hints at continuity of thought rather than opportunism. Villa’s season has not been without bumps, including a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal, yet they remain six points off the leaders and firmly in multiple competitions.\n\nThe FA Cup looms as a genuine opportunity. Villa reached the semi finals last year, losing to Crystal Palace, and Emery knows how thin the margins are. Gallagher’s versatility, energy and Premier League grounding could help Villa sustain challenges on several fronts, including the Europa League, where they are among the favourites.\n\nGallagher’s time in Spain has hardly been a misstep. Since joining Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2024, he has played 51 La Liga games and made 27 appearances in all competitions this season alone. Life under Diego Simeone has clearly resonated.\n\nHe told the FA’s website, “It was amazing, a really good experience. It was a really warm welcome, and it made me feel at home straight away.” On Simeone, he added, “He wants everyone to work as hard as possible… He is one of the best managers in the world.”\n\nYet international football complicates the picture. Gallagher “would welcome a return to England to help his hopes of forcing his way into Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup squad”. Since Tuchel’s arrival, his England involvement has been limited to a 3-1 defeat to Senegal, while Elliot Anderson has surged into contention. Proximity matters, and Premier League visibility still counts.\n\nManchester United’s reported interest feels theoretical for now, given their managerial uncertainty following Ruben Amorim’s exit. Villa, by contrast, offer clarity. Gallagher is not surplus at Atletico, Simeone values him, but football careers often hinge on moments like this.\n\nA return would not diminish his Spanish education. Instead, it could sharpen his relevance at exactly the right time.\n\nFrom an Aston Villa supporter’s perspective, this link makes a lot of sense, even if it comes with understandable nerves. Gallagher feels like an Emery player in spirit. High intensity, tactically disciplined, comfortable pressing and recovering, but also capable of arriving late into the box. Villa have built their rise on structure and energy, and Gallagher fits that profile neatly.\n\nThere is also a sense of maturity about this potential move. This is not a reclamation project or a gamble on potential. Gallagher has 136 Premier League appearances behind him, plus European and La Liga experience. For a squad juggling league ambition, Europa League nights and domestic cups, depth with reliability matters.\n\nSupporters might worry about disrupting midfield balance, especially if the deal carries an obligation to buy. But Emery has shown he can integrate profiles intelligently, rotating without diluting standards. Gallagher’s hunger to re enter the England picture could even work in Villa’s favour, driving performance levels higher.\n\nUltimately, Villa fans want players who see the club as a destination, not a stepping stone. Gallagher’s decision, if it comes, will say a lot about how far Villa believe they have travelled, and how far they still intend to go.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have a break from Premier League action tomorrow when they take on Charlton in the FA Cup third round.\n\nThe Addicks’ manager Nathan Jones has fired up his men ahead of the game, claiming their intent is to give Chelsea a tough game, not look for autographs from their Premier League opposition.\n\n“You start at the third round and you’ve got that opportunity of getting a big one, which is always nice because it’s a test, it’s not because we want to high-five Liam Delap or anyone,” the ex-Southampton coach said.\n\n“What we have to make sure is that it doesn’t become just an autograph session. It becomes a proper game where we can test ourselves, test our structure, test what we do.”\n\nCole Palmer and a fairly generic group of Chelsea players look disappointed. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\n\nWe can certainly expect Charlton to come out all guns blazing. They may be a couple of divisions below, but this is their biggest game of the season so far in terms of audience, and they will want to show what they can do.\n\nMeanwhile Chelsea are in bad form, are playing an intense run of games, will use a mainly rotated team and have a new coach in place. This could be a very tricky tie.\n\nChelsea’s rotten project under BlueCo has been slammed by a player who was at the club in a very different era, and who can’t believe that “money, money, money” is all that remains.\n\nWe won’t get a full preview of Chelsea’s tactics today because it’s going to be a heavily rotated team and he’s only had one day of training. But long term there are questions about how he will solve the big problem from Enzo Maresca’s reign.",

    "description": "Wrexham's remarkable rise continues by knocking Premier League side Nottingham Forest out of the FA Cup in dramatic fashion.",
    "fullText": "\"The stories have been written in the stars, it seems. Literally.\"\n\nWhile scathing of the effort of many of his own players, even Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche acknowledged something is stirring at Wrexham as they knocked his Premier League side out of the FA Cup.\n\nIn front of co-owner Ryan Reynolds, the Red Dragons' Class of 2025-26 etched themselves into cup folklore by taking their top-flight scalp at the Stok Cae Ras on penalties.\n\nWith drama befitting their modern-day Hollywood associationwice they were two goals clear against last year's semi-finalists before being dragged, exhausted, into extra time where they produced a dramatic climax.\n\nFor a club with FA Cup upsets stitched into its fabric, this win was up there with the most climactic - and the hero of the iconic win over Arsenal in 1992, Mickey Thomas, watched on.\n\nBefore the match, manager Phil Parkinson admitted he had wished to take on a Premier League team ever since the club's journey up from the fifth tier began five years ago.\n\n\"We highlighted to the lads some of the great moments in this club's history in the FA Cup and could we make our own bit of history tonight. We've certainly done that,\" Parkinson said.\n\nThey did, and then some - beating top-flight opposition for the first time since 1999 to progress into round four.\n\nBut Wrexham are getting used to writing their own scripts.\n\n\"It's not just about the money, the fame and the people involved who have been amazing in the whole story, but to keep that edge and keep pushing as they're doing is tremendous,\" Forest boss Dyche said.\n\nAnd with a nod to Wrexham's position just outside the Championship play-offs, having been a non-league side as recently as 2023, he added: \"They might well add to the story.\"\n\n'Unacceptable to the badge' - Dyche fumes at FA Cup exit\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\n'I still think of him' - the Wrexham friendship FA Cup hero will never forget\n\nFrom \"colossus\" Arthur Okonkwo's spot-kick heroics to Ollie Rathbone's continued rip-roaring return from injury, and first club goals for both Liberato Cacace and Dom Hyam thrown into the mix, Parkinson said there were \"stories everywhere\" on a truly wild night in north Wales.\n\n\"It's a magical night. It's just a classic FA Cup game,\" said goalscorer Cacace, who was making his first start for Wrexham in more than two months.\n\nIt ensured co-owner Reynolds - accompanied by his mother who witnessed the glory of the world's oldest national football competition in full view - was not left disappointed.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll (Reynolds) be delighted to feel the emotion again inside the Stok Cae Ras,\" said Parkinson.\n\nWrexham sit just one point adrift of the Championship's top six, having won four successive matches in the second tier for the first time in their history.\n\nThe likes of Lewis Brunt, Andy Cannon, Danny Ward, Kieffer Moore and Issa Kabore are all edging ever closer to returning from injury to bolster Parkinson's ranks.\n\nThe possibility of adding to the squad in the January transfer window has not been ruled out, either.\n\nAs for Forest, it's back to the drawing board.\n\nWhile Wrexham made the most of their FA Cup opportunity, Dyche lambasted some of his players for \"not making the most of the platform\".\n\n\"We built up to the game, there was a serious edge to it, we told them about Wrexham - and we were miles off,\" Dyche said.\n\n\"Then we had three important players who came on and showed their hand and the whole thing changed and we looked like a Premier League outfit.\n\n\"The only positive - if there is one out of that first half - is it shows why I'm picking the team I am.\"\n\nForest's focus now will be Premier League survival while Wrexham's will be to join them there next season.\n\nAfter another special night at the Stok Cae Ras - the old romance with the FA Cup no distraction - Wrexham fans will wonder if the stars are aligning for their team this season.\n\nNottingham Forest: Shut Up and Show More Football",

    "fullText": "Manchester City turn to the FA Cup this weekend hoping the competition can provide a release from a frustrating run that has slowed their Premier League momentum.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side host League One opposition Exeter City knowing that domestic cup success may take on added importance given recent league results.\n\nCity arrive in the third round without a win in three matches, having been held to consecutive draws that have stalled their pursuit of high-flying Arsenal at the top of the table.\n\nThose dropped points have not damaged their position irreparably, but they have narrowed the margin for error in a title race that is beginning to stretch.\n\nThe FA Cup therefore offers both an opportunity and a warning, with progress expected but complacency punished ruthlessly in this competition.\n\nCity have been here before, using early-round ties to restore rhythm and confidence when league form has wavered.\n\nGuardiola will expect a sharp response after a sequence of performances that have promised control without delivering the decisive edge.\n\nInjuries and missed chances have played their part, but the feeling persists that City need a result to reset their season.\n\nThis fixture provides the clearest possible platform to do so, even if the opposition arrive with nothing to lose.\n\nExeter City travel to the Etihad as clear underdogs, backed by a sold-out away end and the familiar belief that the FA Cup can rewrite logic.\n\nThe League One side have lifted themselves away from immediate danger in recent weeks and arrive in improved spirits.\n\nTheir journey to this stage has been built on discipline and efficiency, qualities that will be tested relentlessly against elite opposition.\n\nExeter will know that surviving the opening phase would already represent progress, both on the pitch and in belief.\n\nGuardiola’s teams have traditionally treated the FA Cup seriously, reaching the latter stages with remarkable consistency.\n\nHowever, recent finals have ended in disappointment, sharpening the desire to go deeper this time around.\n\nWith other competitions demanding attention later in the month, City will want a professional performance that avoids drama.\n\nRotation is likely, but the expectation of control will remain non-negotiable.\n\nThe gap in resources and quality is vast, yet history offers enough reminders to prevent any sense of entitlement.\n\nEarly goals would settle nerves and allow City to impose structure and tempo.\n\nFailure to do so would invite anxiety and give Exeter a foothold they will gladly exploit.\n\nFor the visitors, the occasion alone is a reward, but the ambition will extend beyond participation.\n\nFor City, this is about restoring authority.\n\nIf they are to keep their season on track, it starts with treating this tie as more than a formality.",

    "fullText": "The FA Cup is still the greatest cup competition in the world and the third round is still a special weekend in the football calendar but, speaking from a manager's perspective, it has become more complicated over the years than it used to be.\n\nThe Premier League now overrides the fixture schedule, and I'm afraid the importance of the FA Cup has diminished somewhat because of that, especially when your club's top-flight status and entire financial footing is at stake.\n\nLike most things in life today, money talks and the Premier League without doubt now does most of the talking.\n\nWith three European league competitions as well, and the number of games and teams involved there, the FA Cup has fallen even further down the pecking order.\n\nWith the number of games now being played, something has to give and it is usually the FA Cup. As a manager, I understood why - even though I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when it was considered very special by everyone - and this year will be no different.\n\nAfter a busy festive period and another round of games in midweek this week, the games this weekend will be looked on by the Premier League teams as a chance to rest some of their players, and in some cases all of them!\n\nIt's sad to see, even if it could lead to opportunities for smaller clubs to join the band of giantkillers which the competition has become famous for down the years.\n\nI have experienced both sides of the coin. When we were promoted to the Premier League in 2008, Stoke initially struggled and at the turn of the year, when we came to a third-round tie at League One side Hartlepool, I changed practically the whole team.",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): He kept a clean sheet against Sunderland, and he's really starting to command as a regular number one. He's starting to show that he commands the area in the right way. Obviously a penalty save always helps.\n\nMichael Keane (Everton): The guy they tried to get rid of, they guy they wanted to replace, the guy they want to move on from, the guy who keeps telling them no. He keeps scoring, he keeps delivering. I think he's gotten really comfortable within his own skin as a human.\n\nIbrahima Konate (Liverpool): I thought this was a vintage Konate performance. Not only did he deliver physically, which we know he can do, but he was in a position to look after his team-mates. When Gabriel Martinelli tried to crudely push Conor Bradley off the pitch at the end, I'm glad Konate stuck up for his team. He got back physically, wasn't a liability and stood up strong.\n\nMax Alleyne (Manchester City): The young man played really, really well against a tough Brighton team. He never got caught wanting and had an opportunity to score. He conducted himself well, and I thought it was a glowing endorsement from Pep Guardiola to start him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): The best player on the pitch. People will say: \"Oh what about him and him?\" But I don't care. If you play football and watch football, you know that Szoboszlai was everywhere. Did the dirty stuff, the horrible stuff, but was one of the best attacking options for Liverpool apart from Jeremie Frimpong. He dictated the play, it was a very good performance.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): He's just a beast. The work that he has done, and the work Eddie Howe has done on him, is just frightening. He keeps popping up with important goals, but remember that they signed him as a striker. He's just turned into a beast of a midfielder who runs all over you.\n\nBrenden Aaronson (Leeds): A couple of goals - though he was at fault for the handball, which was only down to him not being brave enough to take one in the face. Scored two and has won over the Leeds faithful. He's having a really good season and has borne the brunt of some unfair criticism from Leeds fans.\n\nFerdi Kadioglu (Brighton): He was a thorn in Nathan Ake's side all day. On another day, he'd be a bit lucky and score a goal or two, but he was excellent. Brighton weren't scared of Manchester City at all.\n\nHarvey Barnes (Newcastle): Two goals, the second being the match-winner, which was absolute limbs and scenes. He's another player where you're like: \"Go on, show us who you are.\" Unfortunately he always leaves you a little bit wanting. I'm always thinking there's more to come from him. That's not to take anything away from his goals.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Sixteen goals this season. We spoke about him last week - he's flying. Scoring again, carrying Brentford. They've got a real chance as long as he stays fit and continues doing what he's doing.\n\nBenjamin Sesko (Manchester United): He has had a torrid start to his Manchester United career. But he scored two goals at Burnley and you have to give it to him.\n\nKeith Andrews (Brentford): It was a massive result for Brentford to beat Sunderland 3-0. At the start of the season, a lot of people were questioning whether Keith was the right man for the job and whether Brentford could stay in the league.\n\nHis inexperience, the squad getting depleted... now they find themselves on the path towards European places. It's frightening. Sunderland have been really good and I expected them to deal with the physicality of Brentford, but Brentford beat them up.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "Arsenal welcome Liverpool to the Emirates Stadium in a Premier League meeting that carries weight beyond a single evening. This is a fixture shaped by momentum, expectation and the quiet pressure that comes with sustaining belief across a long season. For Arsenal, the aim is continuity. For Liverpool, the task is relevance.\n\nBoth clubs arrive with unbeaten runs worth protecting. Arsenal have responded to early December disappointment with authority, five straight league wins restoring rhythm and confidence. Liverpool, unbeaten in nine across all competitions, have steadied themselves after a turbulent autumn, even if the league table offers an unforgiving reflection of their campaign.\n\nSince the late setback against Aston Villa, Arsenal have rediscovered control. Performances have been sharp rather than spectacular, efficient rather than expansive. That consistency has lifted them back into contention and reinforced the sense that Mikel Arteta’s project continues to edge closer to tangible reward.\n\nProgress to the Carabao Cup semi-final has added to that optimism. Supporters sense an opportunity not simply to win matches but to shape a season. Hosting Liverpool at this point of the campaign feels significant. Victory would represent a sixth consecutive league win and another statement that Arsenal are prepared to shoulder expectation rather than shy away from it.\n\nThe Emirates Stadium has increasingly become a place of assurance. Arsenal’s ability to dictate tempo at home has been central to their recent run, and tonight’s contest offers a chance to underline that authority against familiar opposition.\n\nLiverpool’s story has been more complex. Their nine-game unbeaten sequence speaks of resilience, yet dropped points have left them 14 points adrift of the league leaders. Draws against Fulham, Leeds twice and Sunderland have dulled momentum, even as wins in the capital during this run hint at lingering threat.\n\nArne Slot’s side have not enjoyed a smooth defence of their Premier League title. Injuries, adaptation and inconsistency have shaped a season that has demanded patience. A win over Arsenal would not rewrite the campaign, but it could sharpen its conclusion, offering belief that Liverpool still have influence to exert.\n\nIn the UK, Arsenal vs Liverpool will be shown live on Sky Sports. Coverage begins at 7pm GMT on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League, with kick off scheduled for 8pm.\n\nNeed a VPN to watch the match? Our preferred VPN to watch UK TV from anywhere is LibertyShield.com – they offer a 48 hour no-obligation free trial and have apps or all popular devices including Mac, Windows, FireTV, iPhone/iPad and Android.\n\nThis meeting may not settle the Premier League race, but it will shape how the second half of the season feels for both clubs. For Arsenal, affirmation. For Liverpool, opportunity.",

    "fullText": "Mateus Mane has been on the radar as a bright, young prospect at Wolves for some time and his impact at first-team level has been immediate.\n\nFollowing some promising cameos from the bench, the former Rochdale academy player has started all of Wolves' past four Premier League games. They have yielded five points for his team and two goals expertly taken by the 18-year-old.\n\nAdmittedly much quieter than he had been in the 3-0 win against West Ham - boss Rob Edwards said afterwards that he \"wasn't 100% in terms of his energy\" - Portugal-born Mane provided one of the few moments of real attacking quality that Wolves produced against Everton.\n\nThe England Under-18 international showed wonderful poise to net Wolves' equaliser past England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. After a terrific first touch to control Jorgen Strand Larsen's pass that put him through on goal, there appeared little doubt that he would find the bottom corner with his second.\n\nHe is now Wolves' joint-leading goalscorer in league fixtures this season.\n\nOne of Mane's most noticeable attributes is his willingness to run at defences with the ball and with pace - something which had been sadly lacking for much of the first half of the campaign.\n\nHe leads his team for most dribbles attempted per 90 minutes (4.83) of players who have made more than one league appearance this term.\n\nAlso, Mane is the only Wolves player averaging more than one shot on target per 90 minutes of Premier League action this season (1.41).\n\nThe sample size may be small at this stage, but Mane's introduction to Wolves' starting XI has certainly made a positive difference.",

    "fullText": "The post-Ruben Amorim era showed flashes of promise, but eventually, Manchester United had to be satisfied with only a point from their Premier League encounter against Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nUnder the lights at Turf Moor, it was the home side who took the lead through a lucky deflection, against the run of play.\n\nThe visitors should have scored twice before half-time, but Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha were denied by goalline clearances.\n\nBut then, in the second half, it was the Benjamin Sesko show, as the Slovenian scored twice in 10 minutes to hand the Red Devils the lead.\n\nThe Clarets ended up equalising, but fans were pleased to finally see the Slovenia international return to scoring ways after a difficult last few weeks.\n\nDuring the post-match interaction with BBC, the ex-RB Leipzig striker stated as much, while revealing his delight to end his drought in front of goal.\n\n“It helps me for my confidence,” the striker said. “It’s been tough, but now I finally did it and I’m happy I could help the team.\n\n“This is the most important for me and now it’s just up to me and up to us to keep going like that.”\n\nThere were improvements, both individually, as seen from Sesko and Dorgu’s performance, and as a team, especially from an attacking perspective.\n\nIt was helped by interim boss Darren Fletcher’s brave substitutions. And the United striker told Sky Sports that it is now up to the team to continue this positive momentum moving forward.\n\n“Now it’s up to us. Obviously, to stand together as a group, to really show we can work together no matter what situation.\n\n“In the end, it’s just important for us to focus on the upcoming games, upcoming trainings. That’s the most important.”\n\nUnited will seen next in action in the FA Cup, with a home tie against Brighton on Sunday. Fletcher is expected to remain in charge for the game.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

These two matches will see a makeshift coaching group take charge of the team.\n\nThe Sporting News explains how United will press on in the short term as the 20-time English champions rebuild their managerial structure.\n\nMORE:Why was Ruben Amorim sacked? | Amorim's explosive Leeds rant | Cost of Amorim's exit\n\nFormer Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher will take charge for the match against Burnley on Wednesday, January 7.\n\nThe 41-year-old is likely to remain in charge as caretaker manager until an interim boss is assigned for the remainder of the season.\n\nIt's expected that United will not make a permanent hire until the 2025/26 season is completed, unless something unforeseen progresses before that time.\n\nFletcher's former teammate Jonny Evans has been earmarked to return to the coaching staff to assist this week.\n\nBorn in Scotland, Fletcher made 342 appearances for Manchester United during his decorated playing days, winning five Premier League titles and one Champions League crown in a 20-year career under Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nAfter subsequent stints at West Brom and Stoke City, plus career 80 international caps for Scotland, Fletcher retired in 2019 and transitioned to coaching.\n\nHe returned to United's youth setup in October 2020, hired as the Under-16 coach. He was promoted to the first-team coaching staff in January 2021, concurrently serving as technical director until he was replaced in that role by Jason Wilcox in April 2024.\n\nFletcher made the move back to the youth setup as U-18 coach in July 2025, where he has been until being named caretaker in the wake of Amorim's departure.\n\nWhile Fletcher is a candidate to be named permanent manager of United, a lot would have to happen for that to come to pass.\n\nHe would first have to impress as caretaker enough to earn the interim job for the rest of the season to consider him a true permanent option. Should he do that, then consideration about a long-term position could be brought forth.\n\nEven then, hiring an individual with no senior managerial experience would be an enormous risk, one that United likely would be averse to after the disaster of Amorim's tenure.",

    "fullText": "Two of the Premier League’s surprise European contenders go head-to-head on Wednesday night as seventh-placed Brentford host Sunderland at the Gtech Community Stadium.\n\nThe Bees have defied early-season scepticism under Keith Andrews, mounting a serious challenge for European places following a dominant 4-2 win over Everton. Currently sitting in seventh place with 30 points, they are within touching distance of the top five. They face a Sunderland side that has displayed remarkable resilience under Régis Le Bris.\n\nThe Black Cats occupy eighth place, level on 30 points with their hosts, after securing an “absorbing” 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. While Sunderland have held elite opposition like Manchester City and Spurs recently, they travel to West London searching for a clinical edge to turn these impressive stalemates into three points.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Sunderland 2–1 Brentford, 30 August 2025, Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews reports no fresh injury concerns following the high-scoring victory at Everton. However, the squad remains depleted by long-term ACL injuries to Fábio Carvalho and Antoni Milambo, while Josh Dasilva is still sidelined. The Bees are also missing Frank Onyeka and Dango Ouattara, who are currently representing their nations at AFCON. Midfielder Mathias Jensen is expected to return to the starting XI after a recent bout of illness.\n\nThe Black Cats face a significant personnel crisis due to AFCON commitments, with six first-team players unavailable: Reinildo Mandava, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Arthur Masuaku, Bertrand Traoré, and Habib Diarra. Manager Régis Le Bris must also sweat on the fitness of forward Wilson Isidor, who will undergo a late test. Centre-back Daniel Ballard remains a doubt with a recurring ankle issue, while Aji Alese is a long-term absentee.\n\nBrentford have transformed the Gtech Community Stadium into a fortress under Keith Andrews. They have won six of their 10 home league games this season, a record matched only by Mark Warburton in the club’s modern history. Notably, striker Igor Thiago is in electric form, having netted 14 goals in 20 appearances. He is now just one goal shy of the Premier League record for most goals by a Brazilian in a single campaign.\n\nSunderland arrive as the division’s undisputed “stalemate specialists,” having drawn each of their last four matches against top-tier opposition. Should they draw again on Wednesday, they would be the first team to record five consecutive Premier League stalemates since 2021. Despite their injury woes, their defensive organisation remains elite; the Black Cats have conceded goals in both halves in only 5% of their matches this season.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Ajer, Collins, Henry; Yarmoliuk, Janelt; Jensen, Damsgaard, Schade; Thiago\n\nSunderland predicted XI: Roefs; Hume, Mukiele, Alderete, Cirkin; Geertruida, Xhaka; Mayenda, Le Fée, Adingra; Brobbey\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Tennis, with coverage starting at 18:00 GMT.\n\nRead more- Semenyo medical booked as Man City eye next transfer target\n\nSee Also- Enzo Maresca breaks silence on Chelsea exit with farewell message\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Fresh from a dramatic weekend in the Premier League title race, Aston Villa travel to Selhurst Park on Wednesday night knowing that a victory could propel them into second place.\n\nUnai Emery’s side recently dispatched Nottingham Forest 3-1 to keep pace with the leaders, but they face a historical “bogey” ground in South London. Crystal Palace find themselves in a mid-winter slump, having failed to win in their last seven matches, but the Eagles have traditionally dominated Villa at home, winning nine of their 13 Premier League encounters at Selhurst Park.\n\nWith Villa level on points with Manchester City following the Citizens’ recent 1-1 draw with Chelsea, the stakes for this road trip have never been higher for the high-flying Villans. Despite their lofty league position, Villa have conceded 14 goals in their last four games against Palace—as many as they had in the previous 15 meetings combined. Emery will be desperate to break his personal jinx against Oliver Glasner, having never beaten the Austrian in six previous meetings.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: Aston Villa 0–3 Crystal Palace, 31 August 2025, Premier League\n\nOliver Glasner’s squad depth is being tested to the limit following a bruising encounter at Newcastle. Nathaniel Clyne (abductor) and Jefferson Lerma (concussion) are both ruled out, joining long-term absentees Daichi Kamada, Daniel Muñoz, and Cheick Doucouré on the sidelines. In a significant boost, Chris Richards is set to return to the matchday squad, though he is likely to start on the bench. The Eagles may hand a full debut to club-record signing Brennan Johnson, who joined from Tottenham last week.\n\nThe visitors are sweating on the fitness of defensive mainstays Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres, with both players facing late tests after lengthy injury layoffs. Midfielders Amadou Onana and Ross Barkley remain unavailable, while Evann Guessand is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast. In their absence, the partnership of Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara is expected to continue in the engine room.\n\nPalace boast incredible home dominance in this fixture, winning six of their last seven home games against Villa. This includes the last three in a row by a combined score of 10-1. Jean-Philippe Mateta remains the man to watch; he has been involved in nine goals against Villa—more than against any other Premier League side. However, the Eagles enter this clash without a win in their last seven outings across all competitions.\n\nVilla have been in sensational form, particularly Ollie Watkins, who has scored six goals since the start of December—more than any other player in the division. A win tonight would take Villa to 45+ points after 21 games for only the third time in their history. Notably, on both previous occasions they reached this milestone (1895-96 and 1898-99), they went on to win the league title.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Canvot, Lacroix, Guéhi; Rodney, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Johnson, Pino; Mateta\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Martínez; Cash, Konsa, Lindelöf, Maatsen; Kamara, Tielemans; McGinn, Rogers, Buendía; Watkins\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports+. Coverage begins at 18:00 GMT, with the game kicking off at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead more- Pep Guardiola reacts to Ruben Amorim sacking by Man Utd\n\nSee Also- Two surprise Man Utd candidates emerge as new manager search underway\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "“Now that he finds himself amid the bright lights of the Premier League, why shouldn’t he continue along the same path?”",
    "fullText": "Want an illustration of how quickly time seems to pass by in football terms — or simply graphic proof of how radically things have evolved at Sunderland in recent years?\n\nThe picture below was taken just under three years ago, during a game in which a ridiculously youthful Chris Rigg was denied what would’ve been a fairytale FA Cup goal against Fulham at Craven Cottage and everyone started to sit up and take notice of the latest exciting talent to roll off the Academy of Light’s production line.\n\nDuring the intervening three years, a hell of a lot has changed at the Stadium of Light.\n\nTony Mowbray was temporarily replaced by Mike Dodds, Michael Beale was hired and succeeded as head coach by Mike Dodds and then Régis Le Bris, and the entire process — often difficult and frustrating — eventually led to the promised land of Premier League promotion, with Rigg earning the right to call himself a top flight footballer after a red and white rise that’s encompassed memorable goals, eye-catching performances and plenty of excitement about what he could eventually achieve.\n\nOf course, the dynamic is very different now and if the Sunderland side in which Rigg made his first team debut was talented if somewhat unbalanced and lacking depth in key areas, the team in which he’s currently fighting to establish himself in is of a far higher standard.\n\nUnder Le Bris, Sunderland are competitive in the Premier League and after a heavyweight summer recruitment drive, Rigg is now surrounded by elite talents in more or less every position. As such, the former prodigy is entering the next stage of his development — one during which we all hope his rate of progress will continue.\n\nI firmly believe that at this stage and for the good of his future prospects, Rigg is exactly where he needs to be.\n\nIt’s true that he’s often been played outside of his “natural” position and although he always gives his all when deployed on the wing, it’s obvious that his skillset is best suited to the number ten position, albeit with Enzo Le Fée arguably our leading light in that particular role. That’s not necessarily problematic in itself — this league demands far greater quality and depth, after all — and for Rigg, perhaps it’ll simply be a matter of patience, discipline and seeing the bigger picture.\n\nGiven that he comes across as a single-minded, grounded and extremely driven young footballer, one would hope that the presence of such talent within the Sunderland camp is inspiring Rigg, driving him on and ensuring he keeps his eyes on the goal of constant improvement.\n\nIn my view, one thing is absolutely certain: Rigg should not be loaned out this month and if we arrive at the end of the transfer window having bade a temporary farewell to this immensely talented prospect, it would be detrimental to his own personal development and would also deprive Sunderland of a valuable option; someone who could play an important role during the final months of the season.\n\nDespite the impressive way in which we overhauled the squad during the summer, the long-standing argument of “He’s not ready for the Premier League” is ringing increasingly hollow, as is the notion that we should send a gifted player to the Championship on the basis they need to “toughen up”. In fact, it’s not too dissimilar to the stuff we used to hear as starry-eyed kids back in the Russell Foster days: “This player or that player won’t make it because they’re too small”, and so on.\n\nSuch has been the explosion of talented teenagers in recent years that if you haven’t established yourself by the age of twenty or so, you’re viewed as being behind the curve, but that’s a red herring.\n\nIt’s a universal truth that different players develop at different rates, and the idea of such a quality footballer being farmed out and forced to mix it with the likes of Millwall and Stoke City on the basis that his development will be expedited as a result is fairly gruesome.\n\nRigg is currently training and playing within an elite, high-performance environment, with a coach and captain setting and driving high standards having implemented a style of football that demands a great deal from the squad.\n\nTo my mind, that’s the perfect place for him and I trust Le Bris and his coaching staff to continue to do the right thing — and for Rigg himself to continue to apply himself properly and make the most of any and all opportunities that he’s given.\n\nAs was the case back in 2023, the sky is the limit for Rigg and now that he finds himself amid the bright lights of the Premier League, why shouldn’t he continue along the same path? It’s all within his hands and I’m hopeful that he’ll do exactly that.",

    "fullText": "Wolves travel to Liverpool tonight while they seek to build on their first victory of the Premier League season.\n\nRob Edwards finally secured three points with a dominant 3-0 win over West Ham at the weekend, snapping a 19-game winless run. While they remain at the bottom of the table, the victory has injected vital confidence into the squad. Edwards must now address his side’s poor away record, as the Old Gold have yet to win on the road this term.\n\nRob Edwards manages several significant absentees but is boosted by some positive fitness updates. Hwang Hee-chan and João Gomes are both expected to be fit after overcoming knocks sustained in the win over West Ham. However, captain Toti remains sidelined, and Emmanuel Agbadou is away on AFCON duty with Ivory Coast. Rodrigo Gomes and Marshall Munetsi are also nearing returns but are unlikely to start tonight.\n\nThe visitors are expected to name a largely unchanged side following their impressive performance at Molineux. Jhon Arias, who scored his first goal for the club last time out, will likely continue in midfield alongside André and Mateus Mane. Notably, Hwang Hee-chan reached 30 Premier League goal involvements for the club at the weekend and will be the focal point of the attack alongside Jorgen Strand Larsen. Edwards will be relying on this pair to end Wolves’ open-play goal drought away from home.\n\nWolves predicted XI: Sá; S. Bueno, Mosquera, Krejčí; Tchatchoua, Arias, André, Mané, H. Bueno; Arokodare, Larsen\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Hill Dickinson Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

Their away form isn’t nearly as good, which is another sign of how impressive this record is since they sit on thirty points as they occupy seventh in the table – only ahead of us on goal difference.\n\nEveryone thought the bubble had burst when Thomas Frank left to take the Spurs job, but Andrews has defied all of the predictions, although the pressure is firmly on holding their form at hom,e as only the bottom four have lost more than Brentford.\n\nIn all competitions, we’ve only taken on tonight’s opposition on twenty occasions. In the forty years between meetings in the league that ranged from 1947 and 1987, we took them on twice, once in the FA Cup and once in the League Cup and this is only our fourth trip to Griffin Park for a league game in the last forty years – the first in the top flight since 1946.\n\nIn the last four games, Le Bris’ side has shown how hard we are to beat; tonight we may need a similar performance.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 16/5 to win the game, while Brentford are priced at 4/5, and the draw is 5/2.\n\n[Yennaris 8’, Jozefzoon 47’, Maupay 78’ – Grabban 13’, Bentley (OG) 40’, Grabban (pen) 45’]\n\nSunderland: Steele, Jones, Kone, O’Shea, Oviedo, Watmore (McManaman), Cattermole, Ndong, McGeady (Vaughan), Honeyman, Grabban (Vaughan) Substitutes not used: Ruiter, Matthews, Gibson, Rodwell\n\nBrentford: Bentley, Dalsgaard, Clarke, Dennaris, Egan, Bjelland, Jozefzoon, Woods, Vibe (Maupay), Sawyers (McEachran), Watkins (Canos) Substitutes not used: Daniels, Barbet, Mepham, Mokotjo\n\nThey’re strong at home, and I think it will come down to the only goal of the game.",

Instead of Rosenior, it will be interim head coach Calum McFarlane calling the shots, and hopefully just as effectively as he did over the weekend, when he engineered a very credible 1-1 draw away against Manchester City.\n\nAlas, the only team to truly benefit from that draw were Arsenal, who now have a six point lead at the top of the table, just past the halfway mark of the season.\n\nFor Chelsea, it’s now just one win in our last eight Premier League matches, collecting just eight points from the 24 on offer. Somehow we’re still in fifth, but we’re going to have to start picking up points if we want to remain in the Champions League places by season’s end.\n\nDate / Time: Wednesday, January 7, 19.30 GMT; 2:30pm EST; 1am IST (next day)\nVenue: Craven Cottage, SW6\nReferee: Peter Bankes (on pitch); John Brooks (VAR)\nForecast: Partly sunny and a slight breeze; no more snow sadly\n\nOn TV: Sky Sports Football (UK); none (USA); Star Sports Select HD2 (India); none (NGA); elsewhere\nStreaming: Sky Go (UK); Peacock (USA); JioHotstar (India); DStv Now, SuperSport GOtv (NGA)\n\nFulham team news: It’s been a decent festive period for midtable (as usual) Fulham, getting draws against Liverpool and Crystal Palace and wins against West Ham and Nottingham Forest. Their draw against Liverpool, last time out, saw both teams score in added-on time, with Fulham equalizing on a most unlikely Goal of the Season worldie from Harrison Reed: just his fourth goal in over 200 appearances for the club.\n\nHARRISON REED GOAL FROM ALL OF THE ANGLES WHAT A GOAL 😮‍💨👏🏻pic.twitter.com/DZGfsF6Srw\n\n— KinG £ (@xKGx__) January 4, 2026\n\nAnd they’ve done all that despite losing a trio of key players to Nigeria at the Africa Cup of Nations (Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey, and Samuel Chukwueze), and missing a few others through injury (Josh King, Kenny Tete, and Rodrigo Muniz). In better news for them, Ryan Sessegnon looks set to return from a hamstring problem.\n\nManager Marco Silva is weary of the mental and physical tolls these games have taken on his players, though such concerns can fall by the wayside when it comes to special derbies (even friendly ones), especially when one side may feel wronged by a certain decision (i.e. Josh King’s goal getting ruled in the reverse fixture at the Bridge earlier this season).\n\n“It’s special. It’s special, because we know what’s happened. […] It really hurt ourselves, our fans, this football club, the way we were not able to win the game at Stamford Bridge. The way the team performed almost perfectly first half, in a really tough game against a top, top side, the way the team performed, and everything that happened in that game, really hurt this football club. I’m not talking about one or two persons, or just the players – us, the football club, the way that things happened that Saturday morning.\n\n“It is what it is – now it’s another opportunity for us to enjoy, to embrace a big challenge with our fans to play a derby like a derby should be played. Simple as that. It’s a new game, a new story. I don’t want anyone to think about the past, we have to look for the future, and what’s going to be most important is the next one. It’s a special game.”\n\n-Marco Silva; \n\nChelsea team news: Robert Sánchez and Wesley Fofana were both late scratches over the weekend, with injury and illness, respectively, but they are both back in training and in contention to start. Same goes for Marc Cucurella, who’s barely ever injured, but has missed the last couple games with a hamstring concern. We also welcome back Moisés Caicedo from his latest suspension.\n\nLevi Colwill, Dário Essugo, and Roméo Lavia remain out. The club recently wished Mykhailo Mudryk a happy birthday on social media, so we should probably mention the suspended winger here as well. How’s the appeals process going, Misha?\n\nMcFarlane will be hoping to hand over the reigns to Rosenior with the team back on the right path.\n\n“[This is a] really talented group, young, hungry, have shown they can play at the top top level against top top sides. Anyone associated with the club should be proud of their performance on Sunday and moving forward, this team has massive, massive potential so we should all be excited.”\n\n-Calum McFarlane; \n\nPreviously: Last season, we went to Craven Cottage on a low and came back on an absolute high. Tyrique George’s late equalizer and Pedro Neto’s even-later winner galvanized the team into a scorching hot run of form and results, culminating in not only a top-four finish but winning the FIFA Club World Cup later that summer.",

    "fullText": "Marco Brescianini is emerging as one of the most sought-after midfielders ahead of the January window, with interest now extending beyond Serie A to the Premier League.\n\nThe Atalanta midfielder is believed to be considering a move away from Bergamo in search of regular playing time, and several clubs are monitoring his situation closely.\n\nFiorentina and Lazio have both shown concrete interest in recent weeks, but they are no longer alone in the race.\n\nPARIS, FRANCE – SEPTEMBER 17: Marco Brescianini of Atalanta BC runs with the ball whilst under pressure from Ibrahim Mbaye of Paris Saint-Germain during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Phase MD1 match between Paris Saint-Germain and Atalanta BC at Parc des Princes on September 17, 2025 in Paris, France. (Photo by Franco Arland/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Tuttomercatoweb, via FirenzeViola, Bournemouth have also made an initial enquiry.\n\nThe Premier League side are understood to be gathering information at this stage rather than pushing ahead with a formal bid, but their involvement adds further competition.\n\nBournemouth’s interest is being driven by sporting director Tiago Pinto, a familiar figure in Italian football.\n\nAtalanta’s stance will be crucial.\n\nLECCE, ITALY – AUGUST 19: Marco Brescianini of Atalanta celebrates after scoring his team’s opening goal during the Serie A match between Lecce and Atalanta at Stadio Via del Mare on August 19, 2024 in Lecce, Italy. (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)\n\nThe club are not inclined to sanction a simple loan move and would instead seek an obligation to buy tied to conditions, or potentially a permanent transfer outright. That position could complicate negotiations for clubs hoping for a low-risk deal.\n\nWith Brescianini keen to find space and Atalanta open to evaluating offers on their terms, developments are expected in the coming days.\n\nThe midfielder appears increasingly likely to move on, but only if the right formula is found.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s reported long-standing interest in Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi could hit a snag: another top European club could beat it to the punch this month.\n\nThe German Rekordmeister had been tipped for contract talks with the English international, who is now in the final six months of his current deal and free to negotiate with other clubs as a free agent. However, a run of injuries to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City defense has created the possibility of an immediate transfer, according to reporting in the BBC.\n\nManchester City are exploring a move for Marc Guéhi this month, in the wake of defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias suffering injuries. Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter and Atlético are among the European clubs to have shown an interest in signing Guéhi on a free transfer. Liverpool remain heavily interested. It is understood Crystal Palace would consider selling Guéhi this month to avoid the scenario of losing their captain for nothing come the end of the season. Market regulations mean he can sign a pre-agreement with an overseas club from this month [@SamiMokbel_BBC, @BBCSport]\n\nMan City has dropped points again this weekend, this time to Chelsea, and is seeing its campaign to keep the pressure on Arsenal falter. The Gunners sit six points atop the league after 20 matchdays. Guéhi surely would not come cheap, but the incentives are aligning for all parties involved — and Bayern is in no position at the moment to throw in a bid. If Pep wants Guéhi, it is hard to see this not happening.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

Also, where they are at as a dressing room – have they lost a bit of faith in the manager and what he is doing?\n\n\"They are in a position now where if Nottingham Forest were to beat them, you just start to worry.\n\n\"The problem you get with the new signings coming in too is they have not played in the Premier League, so it is how quickly they can adapt and play under pressure.\n\n\"There is huge pressure at that football club at the moment.\"\n\nEx-Aston Villa and Brentford head coach Dean Smith agreed and added: \"They've got new signings but I never think January is a great month for signings. There becomes a slight desperation when you're looking to bring players in.\n\n\"But they definitely need some players just to have fresh faces in the dressing room because they need a bit of change at the moment.\n\n\"I do [think Nuno is the one to get them out of trouble]. He knows the league, he's been in the league a long time, getting Wolves promoted a long time ago and he did so well at Nottingham Forest last year too.\n\n\"[But] nine games without a win and they need to turn that around quickly. The game against Forest on Wednesday is massive, they can't lose that.\"\n\nListen to the full discussion from 01:50:00 on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Chelsea's first black player, Paul Canoville, says the expected appointment of Liam Rosenior as manager offers \"hope\".\n\nRosenior is set to become the 12th black manager in the Premier League and the fifth permanent black British boss in England's top flight.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, Canoville said: \"Liam Rosenior is a quality coach who knows the game inside out, and that's what matters most. I want to wish him and his staff all the best. We need them to succeed – simple as that.\n\n\"But, as Chelsea's first black player, I would be lying if I said this doesn't move me. I broke ground back in the day and faced things no player should face, just because of the colour of my skin.\"\n\nCanoville, who was subjected to racist abuse in the 1990s after making his Chelsea debut, now works closely with the club through his charitable foundation and has seen changes since his playing days.\n\n\"Since then, we've had trailblazers: Paul Elliott, the first black captain; Ken Monkou, the first black player of the year and Ruud Gullit showing we could manage at the highest level,\" he said.\n\n\"What really strikes me about Liam is that he grew up and played not far from here – he knows this community. His dad Leroy has an MBE for his work tackling discrimination in sport. That's exactly what we do at The Paul Canoville Foundation with young people every day.\n\n\"When kids see someone like Liam managing their club – someone who looks like them, who's from their area, who comes from a family that fights for what's right – that's powerful. It shows them the path is there.\n\n\"So yes, it's a massive moment for the club, for London and for every young person dreaming big. But let's back Liam and let the man do his work.\"",

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim was sacked by Manchester United on Monday, bringing a dramatic end to his turbulent spell as manager of the struggling Premier League giants.\n\nThe dismissal of the Portuguese follows growing tensions between Amorim and the Old Trafford hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox, in recent days.\n\nThe club, sixth in the Premier League after a 1-1 draw at Leeds on Sunday, issued a statement saying Amorim had \"departed his role as head coach of Manchester United\".\n\n\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,\" the club said.\n\n\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\n\n\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"\n\nCurrent under-18s coach Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against struggling Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nAmorim was fired less than 24 hours after making a string of eye-catching comments at Elland Road, where he stressed he was United's manager rather than \"just the coach\", having hinted at frustration behind the scenes on Friday.\n\nThe Portuguese told the scouting department and Wilcox \"to do their job\" during a blockbuster end to a post-match press conference that raised major doubts over his future.\n\nAmorim repeatedly suggested to the media that he would leave when his contract expired in 18 months' time.\n\nBut reports said United's decision to axe their manager was due to the lack of evolution and progress during his 14-month tenure rather than a power struggle.\n\nIt is a dismal end to the reign of Amorim, who won just 25 of his 63 games at the helm in all competitions.\n\nIn the Premier League he had the worst win ratio (32 percent), the worst goals-conceded-per-game ratio (1.53) and the lowest clean-sheet ratio (15 percent) of any United manager.\n\nAmorim arrived at Old Trafford to replace Erik ten Hag in November 2024 as one of the most sought-after coaches in world football following a successful stint at Sporting Lisbon, where he won two league titles.\n\nBut he struggled badly in his first season in charge as United slumped to a 15th-place finish in the Premier League -- their worst campaign for 51 years.\n\nAmorim led the team to the Europa League final in Bilbao in May but they lost to Tottenham, meaning they missed out on European football this season.\n\nUnited have made marginal improvements during the current campaign but have been inconsistent, winning just eight of their 20 league games so far, and are 17 points behind leaders Arsenal.\n\nAmorim's stint is the shortest reign of a permanent manager at United since David Moyes was sacked just eight months into his tenure in 2014.\n\nThe club, 20-time English champions, have not won the Premier League since 2013, in Alex Ferguson's final season in charge.\n\nFormer United midfielder Fletcher was the club's technical director between 2021 and 2024, but he has never held a senior coaching position.",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nEmi Martinez (Aston Villa): It is going to sound very strange because it was a very comfortable Aston Villa win, but he made some key saves from Morgan Gibbs-White in the second half - just after Nottingham Forest got a goal back and it went to 2-1. He just kept them in the game.\n\nMatty Cash (Aston Villa): He was excellent. He has been excellent for a few weeks now but a massive outlet for Aston Villa. When they are dominant on the ball, he's the outlet on the right-hand side and got a lovely little assist in there as well. He is the main outlet and he really jumps off the pitch when you are watching the games.\n\nMalick Thiaw (Newcastle): From November onwards, he has been exceptional. He had a tough time in Italy but he is delivering consistently now. He scores a goal, which always helps for any defender in this team of the week. Solid performance, delivered, was more aggressive and I feel like he is starting to get his bearings now and feel like he is the man at Newcastle.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): Goal and an assist with the flick-on. I just think when they first signed him from Wolves, I didn't get it. Now I do. Especially under Keith Andrews. He organises well, he moves the ball really strongly from the back. He is the leader of that team. Forget Jordan Henderson, he is the leader of that team. Obviously goals help at centre-back.\n\nBen Davies (Tottenham): I don't think this is a name I ever thought I was going to put in but Ben Davies, fair play to him. He plays only his third game of the season, starts, they had Djed Spence on the bench as well - which shows the level of professionalism and maturity that he continues to deliver - and he gets a goal. It just shows to me that you don't always have to be 37 and written off. He's 32 and he's already been written off, he's got a World Cup to hopefully go to with Wales. He is always fit and available, which is what I really like.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): Two goals, leader, future England captain - do we need to say anything else?\n\nMateus Mane (Wolves): Eighteen years old, England youth international, doesn't have any noise, hasn't got any brothers with T-shirts saying to 'free him and let him play'. He goes out, plays, scores goals, gets an assist, gets the penalty and just delivers with no fuss. How beautiful is that? No fuss. I saw his interview after the game, he doesn't complain, doesn't get too over the top, just simple. Love it.\n\nJohn McGinn (Aston Villa): He obviously has to be in here. Two goals, the second goal he is obviously buzzing because the keeper made it so easy for him - but it feels like he has had a love-hate relationship with Unai Emery for about three years now. It has started to come to fruition. He has been a really important piece for this Aston Villa side.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): He gets a goal and it probably should have been the match-winner for Man City if we are being totally honest. They will feel like they should have won that game. Reijnders has got three goals in his last four matches and that shows his importance. He is growing. He had a really good start and then I think the reality of English football caught up with him for a period, but now he has got his second wind and he is playing well. He is going to be really important if City are to try to catch Arsenal.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Like me, you probably took him out of your fantasy football team thinking he had fallen off a cliff, and then he has scored every week since. So that just basically says more about my fantasy football managerial ability more than anything to do with his performances! But he is the rock, the leader, making sure he is right up there for that conversation for Brazil with the World Cup squad. You've got Joao Pedro, Richarlison, Gabriel Jesus - these are the guys who are all being spoken about. Even Neymar, but he's the one with the most goals, he is the one delivering with the most performances week in, week out. I'm backing him to make the squad.\n\nCody Gakpo (Liverpool): It was a game where Liverpool will feel they should have won it, nicking it in the 94th minute and then obviously Fulham score in the 97th minute. I think it is just one of those moments where you look at the team and you think no Hugo Ekitike, no Alexander Isak, who is going to step up and score the goals? To be fair to him, he's done it all season and that's why he goes in.\n\nRob Edwards (Wolves): First win for Wolves, a massive game against West Ham. I think in those games, because I have played in them, you need your manager to be resolute. To get you up but not get you over the edge and I think he just had both the tactics and emotion of the game spot on. Didn't go over the needle, didn't go under it and his team obviously delivered a massive 3-0 victory which gives them a fight - because if they had lost that game, relegation would have been all done and dusted. Now, hopefully they can get another win in the week and build on that momentum. For right now, it's huge for him and thankfully it is the first time we say something positive about Wolves all season - so massive kudos to Rob and his team.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "description": "In an ideal world, we see a Liverpool team that is dominant but creates more chances.  Alexander Isak is out and I have to overload or play Hugo more, a player who has never played in the Premier League.",
    "fullText": "Arne Slot spoke to Sky Sports after Liverpool's draw against Fulham: \"In an away game, scoring two goals should maybe be enough to win the game. It's not for the first time this season that we fight so hard and think we have a win but concede an incredible strike. We brought Joe Gomez in but they took it short. We missed out on a good result.\n\n\"We had our chances in the first half. We had a similar one with Cody Gakpo that they scored from. In an ideal world, we see a Liverpool team that is dominant but creates more chances. We scored two goals, scored two disallowed goals and hit the bar. Again, it wasn't enough.\n\n\"The players are giving everything they have. I have to keep in mind that I have to keep them available. Alexander Isak is out and I have to overload or play Hugo more, a player who has never played in the Premier League. You have to manage that. We still have 11 very good players on the pitch.\n\n\"It's not only for us, but many teams don't create chances every game. It's not perfect but at least we've created a few more chances today than last week.\"\n\nCody Gakpo spoke to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's disappointing for us. We fought very hard in the second half, dominated at moments and tried to create chances to get through. At the end I scored in minute 95, they scored in minute 97 - a wonderful goal to be fair. Unlucky, unfortunate.\n\n\"This is a moment that can happen in a game. I was just sitting down so I did not see the moments before. I just saw him take a touch and shoot the ball into the top corner.\n\n\"I think if you are going to analyse the game maybe we should have scored more goals or defended the two goals better. In the end we should do much better. There were moments that we showed how good we were but it is up to us to stay consistent and put in overall better performances. I'm sure the wins will come again.\"\n\nOn playing in the nine: \"As a forward player you always want to score goals to help the team so it's a plus for me. In the end it's a team sport and we didn't win so I'm still disappointed.\"",

    "fullText": "Liverpool faced off against Fulham at Craven Cottage earlier today as they hoped to secure a win on the road in the Premier League. The Reds made a slow start to the game and conceded the opener in the 17th minute when Harry Wilson found the back of the net. Arne Slot’s men went into the half-time break 1-0 down on the scoreline.\n\nFlorian Wirtz equalised for the Merseyside club in the 57th minute before Cody Gakpo gave Liverpool the lead in injury time. However, Harrison Reed scored a dramatic equaliser with a brilliant strike soon after. The match ended with Arne Slot’s players being held to a lackluster 2-2 draw at Craven Cottage.\n\nLet’s take a look at how each Liverpool player fared during the clash against the Cottagers.\n\nHe failed to make a save in the game and conceded two goals this afternoon.\n\nBradley performed his defensive duties well and made one key chance going forward.\n\nHe cleared the danger when he could, but failed to keep things solid at the back.\n\nVan Dijk was far from convincing with his decision-making but was tidy with his passing.\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND – JANUARY 04: Arne Slot, Manager of Liverpool, applauds the fans following the Premier League match between Fulham and Liverpool at Craven Cottage on January 04, 2026 in London, England. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nHe came back to defend when required, but failed to impress going forward.\n\nGravenberch did his fair share of defending but lacked quality in the Fulham half.\n\nHe engineered a few key chances in the final third, but there was no goal for him.\n\nSzoboszlai was quiet for most of his time on the field.\n\nCAM: Alexis Mac Allister – 6.5/10\n\nHe worked hard defensively but lacked creativity in the final third.\n\nWirtz caught the eye at times in and around the Fulham penalty area and managed to score the equaliser in the 57th minute.\n\nHe was not shy of having a strike at goal and managed to put Liverpool ahead in injury time.",

That is the mentality we need from all of us.\"\n\nWhen asked if Rice was one of the best midfielders in the world, Arteta said: \"For me, yes.\n\n\"Declan is constantly adding things to his game, and his role in the team, and I don't see where he can stop because he can still improve in a lot of areas and he wants to improve.\"\n\nBBC Sport looks at how good Rice, the £100m signing from West Ham, has become.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal defender Gabriel showed remarkable resilience to put his side back on level terms after gifting Bournemouth an opener in their Premier League clash at the Vitality Stadium.\n\nIt's a crucial fixture for Mikel Arteta's side as they look to pile the pressure on their title rivals and extend their lead at the top of the table.\n\nBut things started in the worst possible way on the south coast as Gabriel handed the hosts an opening goal on a plate.\n\nInstead of picking out one of his teammates, he played the ball straight to Evanilson, who had all the time and space in the world to pick his corner and fire Bournemouth in front.\n\nThe Cherries' lead didn't last long, however, as Gabriel was quick to make amends for his mistake with a crucial equaliser.\n\nBournemouth didn't effectively deal with a set piece, and it eventually fell to the Brazilian in the box, who fired it home with a strong strike.\n\nGabriel is now just two goals away from matching his best-ever tally in a Premier League season, with only half the season played, according to StatMuse.\n\nCan Arsenal complete the comeback and secure all three points against Bournemouth, or will they be held in a major boost to chasers Manchester City and Aston Villa?\n\n📸 Richard Heathcote - 2026 Getty Images",

    "title": "‘Just a rumour’: Why Enzo Maresca to Man City never made any sense",
    "description": "The Italian was linked with a move to the Etihad Stadium to replace his former master, but the City boss has dismissed speculation as he bids to reel in Arsenal in a gripping Premier League title race",
    "fullText": "If Enzo Maresca’s last contribution as a Manchester City employee was to help them secure the treble in 2023, his most recent input to the discourse around the Etihad Stadium feels more unwelcome. The apparent indications that City’s former assistant manager had spoken to his old club about the possibility of replacing Pep Guardiola raised the issue of the Spaniard’s future.\n\nWhich has lingered in the background; as, indeed, it has for much of a reign that has extended for far longer than he originally envisaged. The Catalan shrugged off the idea that his old assistant had talked to City. “Why would I give you an update about an opinion that I don't know is about this opinion?” he said. “It's just a rumour.”\n\nGuardiola adopted a trademark blend of playfulness and faux arrogance. “You want to fire me?” he asked “My salary is so high, so I have one more year... I know you are bored of me, 10 years here. I will leave one day, I promise. But I have a contract, I'm happy, I want to fight with my team. I like to be here.”\n\nThat contract expires in 2027. If the idea is gaining credence that Guardiola could walk away 12 months early, that agreeing a deal of that length was actually to spare him a season of questioning this year, City are entitled to call such ideas speculative. The chances are that only one man knows if Guardiola will go in the summer. And perhaps not even that, if Guardiola has not decided yet.\n\nCity have reasons to compile contingency plans, but plan A remains the man with six Premier League titles and a couple of trebles; if Guardiola asked for a new deal tomorrow, it is safe to assume City would not decline on the grounds they had Maresca lined up.\n\nBut maybe Maresca’s unravelling at Chelsea illustrated the difficulties of replacing Guardiola. The Italian’s meltdown in the space of barely a month at Stamford Bridge might indicate he is ill-equipped for the job; Guardiola has his quirks but has found ways of managing elite clubs for 16 of the past 17 years. His methods have been more sustainable than Maresca’s.\n\nIf Maresca overplayed his hand with Chelsea by seemingly presenting himself as the most coveted property in football management, it would also rank as a surprise if he were actually City’s top choice. There is a school of thought that could be Vincent Kompany, another educated by Guardiola, whose children are half-Mancunian, but who has the complication of being Bayern Munich’s manager.\n\nMuch would rest on the timing of the vacancy, which in turn comes down to Guardiola. By the summer, Xabi Alonso may no longer be Real Madrid manager. Thomas Tuchel might be moving on from England. Each could be deemed a more credible candidate than Maresca. If Luis Enrique, Julian Nagelsmann or Mikel Arteta were available – implausible as any of that sounds right now – they should have an appeal.\n\nMaresca is not alone in learning from Guardiola: so did Cesc Fabregas and Xavi, besides Kompany, Alonso and Arteta. The Premier League’s status as a hotbed of managerial talent could provide a case for Andoni Iraola or Oliver Glasner, depending on who is the flavour of whichever month when City are looking. Despite his close friendship with City’s director of football, Hugo Viana, and their productive time together at Sporting CP, it is safe to assume Guardiola’s replacement will not be Ruben Amorim. Rewind 14 months, however, and the argument was made that Manchester United had to hire him to prevent City from doing so.\n\nSome may see parallels between Guardiola and Arsene Wenger, whose supposed successors faded away or moved elsewhere as the Frenchman went on and on. The City manager may prefer comparisons with Sir Alex Ferguson, who went out by winning the league. The most relevant example may involve his greatest rival, Jurgen Klopp. The German went of his own volition, before the end of his contract, after laying a platform with the creation of a new team.\n\nLiverpool 2.0 enthused Klopp even as he knew he was tiring. Guardiola has been given fresh energy by this younger, faster City side, even if the probability is that Arsenal will pip them to the title. Maybe Guardiola, in developing Nico O’Reilly and bringing in Rayan Cherki, Jeremy Doku and, perhaps, Antoine Semenyo, is preparing his own gift for the man who will take his seat in the dugout in due course.\n\nOne factor in Klopp’s decision was that he did not want to go out after Liverpool’s traumatic 2022-23. City experienced something similar last season in the worst run of Guardiola’s career. Perhaps it was a sign of his commitment that he did not walk away then. Nor was he fired. “The hierarchy respects me,” he said. “They proved it last season with what happened when we didn't win one game in two, three months.”\n\nIt was a way in which City showed they are not Chelsea. The sense has long been that Guardiola would never have taken the Chelsea job. But as he remains in a job and Maresca is out of one, it remains to be seen if a protege is ever offered the chance to take over from him.",

    "description": "As Leeds aim to beat Manchester United in the Premier League for the first time since 2002, BBC Sport looks at their intense rivalry before Sunday's Elland Road meeting.",
    "fullText": "In his best-selling 'Managing My Life' autobiography, Sir Alex Ferguson reflected on his feelings about a trip to Elland Road.\n\n\"The crowd invariably give us the impression that a lynching would be too good for us,\" he said.\n\nAfter a typically fraught League Cup victory there in 2011, Ferguson offered this observation too.\n\n\"I have always said Liverpool-Manchester United games are fierce in many aspects,\" he added.\n\n\"But it never reaches the levels of Leeds United. Never.\"\n\nLeeds have already hosted a couple of historic rivals in December, beating Chelsea 3-1 at home and producing an epic fightback to snatch a point in a 3-3 draw against Liverpool.\n\nBut a visit from Manchester United is something else.\n\n\"I have a decorating firm and for 40 years we have had the motto that we will not use red paint,\" said lifelong Leeds fan Gary Edwards.\n\n\"We will paint over red free of charge. It's still going to this day. It's on all the business cards and letterheads.\"\n\nThe actual origins of the rivalry are difficult to pinpoint.\n\nMany feel it dates to the War of the Roses in the 15th century, although that is probably too simplistic given the Duchy and Dukedom of the Houses of York and Lancaster had little to do with the cities themselves and the Duchy of Lancaster had land and offices in Yorkshire.\n\nOthers think the rivalry has its origins in the industrial revolution which does, at least in part, correspond to the emergence of football as an organised sport - even if neither club, either originally as Leeds City and Newton Heath, or their current names, came to real prominence until after the Second World War.\n\nPossibly, the reverence from the 1950s and beyond for the Busby Babes compared to the negativity around Don Revie's team in the 1960s and 70s, is a factor.\n\nThe knowledge that key players - Johnny Giles, Gordon Strachan, Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Denis Irwin and Eric Cantona among them - left one club to become an integral part of the success of the other is another. Also, the proximity of the best supported teams from the two biggest cities in two neighbouring counties, separated geographically, by the Pennines.\n\nWhatever it is, the rivalry is real and despite the early 12:30 GMT kick-off, Elland Road is guaranteed to be a cauldron as Leeds look for their first home victory over Manchester United in the Premier League since 2002, when Harry Kewell scored the winner.\n\nFormer England goalkeeper Paul Robinson was in goal for Leeds that day and told BBC Sport: \"One hundred percent it feels different.\n\n\"You get to the stadium two hours before kick-off and certain areas are sectioned off. There are police here, you can't drive there. This road is closed, that road is closed.\n\n\"It is as intense as any derby that you want to name in this country - and it is not friendly.\n\n\"I grew up as a kid in the Leeds academy and was a ball boy at some games. The away section used to be in the cheese wedge in the corner of Elland Road. For most of the season, nobody wanted to be a ball boy in that corner. But when Manchester United came to town, everybody wanted to be over in that corner, for whatever reason.\n\n\"It was just a different game and a different experience.\"\n\nNeither manager has been part of a Leeds-Manchester United game before.\n\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke knows it is a game that means a lot for his club's fans and is talking about making \"dreams come true\".\n\nManchester United's Portuguese head coach Ruben Amorim has been at the centre of the Dérbi de Lisboa, as a player for Benfica and a coach at Lisbon rivals Sporting.\n\nHe is not sure the comparison is particularly helpful.\n\n\"I heard it is a big rivalry and a big derby,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"It is hard to compare different cultures, different derbies and different histories. It's a game in a hostile environment and that is going to be hard for any player. But when you play for Manchester United, you need to be ready for everything.\"\n\nLeeds' last title-winning campaign in 1992 was made more satisfying because they won it at the expense of Manchester United, who were in control of their own destiny until a run of three successive defeats in the space of seven days right at the end of the season let Howard Wilkinson's side in.\n\nSadly for Leeds, the post-script came the following November, when chief executive Bill Fotherby rang Manchester United counterpart Martin Edwards to ask about the chances of bringing full-back Irwin back to the club.\n\nFerguson was in the room and said no to Irwin leaving, but told Edwards to mention the availability of French forward Cantona. It was a call that changed the course of English footballing history.\n\n\"I've never forgiven Bill for that,\" says Gary Edwards.\n\nMaybe one of the reasons why Leeds' rivalry with Manchester United doesn't spring to mind in the same way as others in England is the relative infrequency of it happening.\n\nApart from the 14-year spell that began with Leeds' top-flight promotion in 1990 and relegation in 2004, the two clubs met only eight times in the other 30 years from 1982. Leeds won once in 2010, as a League One side at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, and lost on five occasions.\n\nThe two clubs' fans don't forget though.\n\n\"Even when Leeds were in League One and the Championship, Manchester United still sang a song about teams they didn't like and tagged 'and Leeds' on to it,\" said Robinson, who had six years at Leeds before joining Tottenham in 2004.\n\n\"Week in, week out, no matter what league they are in or who they are playing against, Leeds fans take great pride week in describing their dislike of Manchester United.\"\n\nLeeds go into the game in better form, having added a goalless New Year's Day draw draw at Anfield to their home comeback against Arne Slot's men to take their current unbeaten record to six games and seven points clear of relegation in 16th place. It is their best top-flight form since April 2021, when Marcelo Bielsa was in charge.\n\nRegardless, Robinson believes there are some Leeds fans for whom a successful season this time around would be to finish 17th and beat Manchester United.\n\n\"That does exist,\" said Gary Edwards. \"I'm not quite like that, but 100% there are fans who think that way.\n\n\"I just feel it is as good a time to play them as any because we have turned a corner.\n\n\"We've kept the same formation and the same players who looked dire at the start of the season are now assured and confident.\n\n\"It will make the game interesting. Very, very interesting.\"",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are reportedly one of several Premier League clubs keeping close tabs on Watford sensation Othmane Maamma.\n\nOver the past few years, Watford have developed a reputation for identifying top football talent and selling them for significant profits, as exemplified by the high-profile transfers of the likes of Richarlison, Ismaila Sarr and Joao Pedro.\n\nOnce again, Watford seem to have a major sale brewing, with Maamma the player in question. Signed from Montpellier last summer for a reported fee of less than £1m, Maamma is virtually guaranteed to sell for several times that amount, thanks to his meteoric rise at Vicarage Road in England’s second tier.\n\nA two-footed winger, Maamma can be deployed to great effect on either flank. The 20-year-old has racked up 20 Championship appearances so far this term, contributing three goals and one assist in that period.\n\nIn what is his breakout campaign, Maamma has already cemented his status as one of Watford’s best and most important players, catching the eye with his ability to beat defenders with his ball control and unpredictability, explosive pace and remarkable composure.\n\nHe first shot into the limelight during the Under-20 World Cup, with the Moroccan winning the Player of the Tournament award. He followed that up with the African Young Player of the Year prize.\n\nAlthough omitted from Morocco’s recent Africa Cup of Nations squad, Maamma is on course to secure a place in their World Cup selection this summer.\n\nAccording to TEAMtalk, the youngster has popped up on United’s radar.\n\nTEAMtalk report, “Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United were all at Vicarage Road on Thursday to watch Watford starlet Othmane Maamma, TEAMtalk can reveal.”\n\n“Brighton, Brentford and Sunderland have also been watching.”\n\nThe report adds, “Watford paid Montpellier less than £1million in the summer, and although they are not planning a January sale, it would be hard to turn down a huge profit on the Moroccan if someone tabled an offer.”\n\nIt’s understood that this is not the first time United and other interested parties have sent representatives to see Maamma in action.\n\nSince Sir Jim Ratcliffe assumed operational control of United, the Red Devils have shifted their focus toward signing young talent, making their pursuit of Maamma a logical next step. It now remains to be seen which suitor will formalise their interest with a concrete offer.\n\nFeatured image Leila Coker via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

The centre-back has the joint-most headed attempts (five) of all Brighton players this season.\n\nNot content with an assist, Armando Broja (£5.2m) of Burnley became only the second forward to secure defensive contribution points in gameweek 19.\n\nWolves midfielder Andre is available after serving a one-match suspension.\n\nIn a further boost for the hosts, defender Santi Bueno has overcome the dead leg which caused him to miss the midweek 1-1 draw at Manchester United.\n\nWest Ham will assess the fitness of French centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo, who suffered a groin injury early in the second half of Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Brighton.\n\nOn-loan defender Igor Julio is available again after being ineligible to face his parent club in midweek.\n\nPlayers out: Wolves - Agbadou, Bellegarde, Chiwome, Munetsi, Rodrigo Gomes, Toti Gomes West Ham - Diouf, Fabianski, Fullkrug, Wan-Bissaka\n\nWolves' Ladislav Krejci (£4.5m) produced his third attacking return of the season in gameweek 19, earning eight points at Old Trafford.\n\nJarrod Bowen's (£7.6m) last six appearances for West Ham have harvested three goals, one assist and 32 points.\n\nLucas Paqueta's (£5.9m) 23 chances created and six big chances created are both team-leading totals for West Ham.\n\nBournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola is hopeful that Lewis Cook could be fit to face Arsenal after missing the draw against Chelsea because of a neck issue.\n\nRyan Christie remains sidelined with a persistent knee problem.\n\nArsenal midfielder Declan Rice missed Tuesday's 4-1 victory over Aston Villa with inflammation in his knee but he will train on Friday before a decision is made on his availability.\n\nDefenders Riccardo Calafiori and Cristhian Mosquera remain out.\n\nPlayers out: Bournemouth - Adams, Christie, Gannon-Doak, Milosavljevic Arsenal - Calafiori, Dowman, Mosquera\n\nDoubts: Bournemouth - Cook Arsenal - Rice\n\nDavid Brooks (£5.0m) of Bournemouth has been presented with eight Opta-defined 'big chances' in the last four gameweeks, the most of any player.\n\nArsenal's Gabriel Magalhaes (£6.4m) marked his first start since returning from injury with a 15-point haul against Villa. The Brazilian has blanked in only four of his 13 appearances this season.\n\nMartin Odegaard's (£7.8m) 20 chances created over the last six gameweeks is more than any other player in Fantasy.\n\nLeeds captain Ethan Ampadu must serve a one-match ban on Sunday for accumulating five bookings this season.\n\nSebastian Bornauw and Ilia Gruev both came off with cramp against Liverpool on Thursday night and should be fit to face Manchester United.\n\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim expects to have an unchanged squad, with five players still injured and another three at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nPlayers out: Leeds - Ampadu, James, Longstaff, Rodon Manchester United - Amad, De Ligt, Fernandes, Maguire, Mainoo, Mazraoui, Mbeumo, Mount\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin (£5.9m) of Leeds has returned in each of his last three matches at Elland Road, combining four goals with six bonus to total 28 points.\n\nAnton Stach (£4.9m) has an eye-catching three goals and five assists from 16 starts in 2025-26. He is Leeds' leader for chances created (33) and successful crosses (24) across the campaign.\n\nMatheus Cunha (£8.2m) has produced an attacking return in each of his last two away appearances for Man Utd, amassing 14 points.\n\nJack Grealish has resumed full training for Everton after overcoming illness and he could start for the first time in two weeks.\n\nCharly Alcaraz and Michael Keane both missed the midweek away win over Nottingham Forest but the latter \"has a chance\" of being fit to face Brentford, according to manager David Moyes.\n\nBrentford defender Sepp van den Berg returned to the matchday squad as an unused substitute on New Year's Day, having missed the 4-1 victory over Bournemouth due to a minor injury.\n\nMathias Jensen didn't start against Spurs on Thursday because he'd had a sickness bug.\n\nPlayers out: Everton - Alcaraz, Branthwaite, Coleman, Dewsbury-Hall, Gueye, Ndiaye Brentford - Carvalho, Dasilva, Milambo, Onyeka, Ouattara\n\nEverton's James Garner (£5.0m) entertains Brentford on the back of 21 points in his last two appearances.\n\nEverton's clean sheet versus Nottingham Forest in gameweek 19 was the Toffees' eighth of the season, which only Manchester City and Arsenal have bettered. James Tarkowski (£5.6m) was particularly dominant, racking up 19 defensive contributions.\n\nIgor Thiago's (£7.0m) 19 appearances for Brentford this season have served up 11 goals, one assist, 12 bonus and 91 points.\n\nFulham head coach Marco Silva said there is a \"big possibility\" midfielder Josh King will miss Sunday's game, along with full-back Kenny Tete.\n\nSilva added that King is feeling pain in his knee but neither player is likely to be out for an extended period.\n\nLiverpool are managing Florian Wirtz's workload as the German has sore hamstrings.\n\nDefender Joe Gomez could be available to face Fulham after three weeks out.\n\nPlayers out: Fulham - Bassey, Chukwueze, Iwobi, Muniz, Sessegnon Liverpool - Endo, Isak, Leoni, Salah\n\nDoubts: Fulham - King, Tete Liverpool - Gomez\n\nHarry Wilson (£5.8m) has been a major influence on Fulham's attack recently.

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nRobin Roefs (Sunderland): I think he has arguably been the signing of the season. Unbelievable the way he keeps performing to that same level and standard. He kept Sunderland in it against Manchester City with three or four great saves. The way that he has been playing and that backline has been playing, I could have just put that whole backline in. They were excellent and I thought he epitomised that.\n\nTrai Hume (Sunderland): We talk about Granit Xhaka, we talk about Roefs and we have spoken about individuals like Dan Ballard and the like but I think Hume has been their best performer throughout the whole course of it. Nobody is really talking about it.\n\nJaka Bijol (Leeds): At Anfield, everyone would have expected Liverpool to really, really do a job on this team here and make sure that they were ready to go. Unfortunately, Leeds are flying high. They defended resolutely and rode their luck, there was a massive chance for Hugo Ekitike to score and he probably should have but Leeds are in a good vein of form and Bijol has been an unsung hero.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): The game against Spurs was poor and the abilities and the attacking threat was poor. It was a defensive unit for both but I thought Nathan Collins was arguably the best defender on the pitch. Brentford continue their opportunity to stay in the league and that is going to be based on how defensively solid they are.\n\nMartin Zubimendi (Arsenal): Arsenal signed Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke and all of these other players that people were looking at. Probably their best bit of business was getting Zubimendi in early doors. He dictates the play, he's chipping in with a few goals as well now but he's really important to the way that they conduct themselves.\n\nJames Garner (Everton): He has played right-back, left-back, centre midfield, right midfield, you name it. He will play anywhere that Everton ask him to play. He does a job, not only is he a solid pro and a good kid but he never complains. When he's on the bench he doesn't complain, when he's playing he doesn't demand contracts and wages and things of that nature. A goal and an assist for him obviously helped Everton get a wonderful 2-0 victory at Nottingham Forest and he was a huge part of that.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): Is there a more dominant midfielder in the Premier League? I'll wait. 6ft 4in, can run all over you, can fight with you but also can do what he did against Burnley and score a goal after two minutes that was worthy of winning any game.\n\nDavid Brooks (Bournemouth): Brooks was the best player on the pitch for me against Chelsea by a country mile. He scored but it was just the way he took Bournemouth up the pitch. There are a lot of eyes on Antoine Semenyo and that he is probably leaving but I just thought that Brooks was fantastic in the way that he carries the ball and he will be the person who carries Bournemouth, not only to safety but to whatever position they end up in this season, it will be on his shoulders.\n\nLeandro Trossard (Arsenal): It's amazing to think that they were going to let him go. There was talk at the start of the season that he was going to be the one to come under the PSR rules. For me, he could be Arsenal's unsung hero of the year. He's now solved that left-sided problem which was an area with Gabriel Martinelli, then they brought Noni Madueke in, they tried Eberechi Eze out there. He's the starting left-sided player, it's just a given. Another goal, an emphatic goal but his work-rate and energy for the team is what's most impressive for me.\n\nYoane Wissa (Newcastle): First goal in two games. He's had a tough start since he got in to Newcastle after being injured but as a spark, he has a willingness to work for his team and an infectious personality that makes everybody else run if he is running. He's always smiling so that's why he gets in the team.\n\nJarrod Bowen (West Ham): When people talk about Bruno Fernandes, the first thing they say is where would Manchester United be without him? Where would West Ham be without Jarrod Bowen over the past five years? Honestly, the guy just keeps performing, takes the brunt of it as the captain and the face of West Ham. He knows what comes with that and the pressures that come with that but he keeps delivering and performing. Another goal for him in the draw with Brighton. If West Ham are to be safe this season, they'll rely on him heavily.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): Unbelievable result. Everyone looking at Arsenal coming up against an Aston Villa team that is in form and flying and looking at it as if they were going to struggle due to Declan Rice being out an a few others. It felt like this was a moment where Arsenal could potentially struggle. They didn't, Arteta found a way to win. It wasn't as easy as the scoreline suggested when you look at the first half chances for Villa. However, it was a massive win and a massive statement, especially when you look at Man City dropping a couple of points away at high-flying Sunderland.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

Second half we had a lot more chances and today was one of those days we couldn't finish them.\n\n\"We are not happy because we wanted better than this.\"\n\nAs goalless draws go, this was an thoroughly entertaining one with both teams having chances to claim all three points.\n\nThe home fans grew in confidence as the match wore on but City could not find the key to unlock the defence as Sunderland maintained their impressive unbeaten record at home this season.\n\n\"If you look at Sunderland's home record I think it's a point well-earned,\" former Manchester City defender Steph Houghton said on BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"They [City] will overall be disappointed because of the chances they created but if you look at the likes of Arsenal and Aston Villa, to go there and get a point, we are half way through the season, there is a long, long way to go.\"\n\nJust like Arsenal in November, City could not beat the Black Cats.\n\nAnd Sunderland boss Regis le Bris was understandably delighted by the result, saying: \"I'm enjoying [it]. I think we showed strong character against probably one of the best teams in Europe at the minute.\n\n\"It was important to defend well. I think we were bold because we tried to be aggressive and high up the pitch. I think we disturbed their routine, maybe their flow and it was really important.\n\n\"We created a few chances as well, so it was a good game.\"",

    "description": "The Italian departs with the club fifth in the Premier League table, 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal",
    "fullText": "Chelsea have parted company with Enzo Maresca after a rapid fallout between the manager and the club’s hierarchy. The club have already begun making contingency plans, with Strasbourg’s Liam Rosenior now seen as the likeliest successor.\n\nMaresca’s future had been uncertain as far back as September, and a poor start to the season, but significantly escalated over the last week.\n\nThe Italian had even made a known dissatisfaction with his situation public, having made a cryptic comment about his “worst 48 hours” at the club after the 2-0 win over Everton on 13 December. This was understood to relate to his relationship with the hierarchy, and frustration over a perceived lack of support. The Independent had nevertheless been told that there was increased scrutiny on Maresca’s performance since September, despite trophy wins in the Europa Conference League and Club World Cup last season.\n\nRecent reports of Manchester City interest in Maresca in the event of Pep Guardiola’s departure also raised eyebrows.\n\nChelsea said in a statement: “During his time at the Club, Enzo led the team to success in the UEFA Conference League and the FIFA Club World Cup. Those achievements will remain an important part of the Club’s recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the Club.\n\n“With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the Club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track.\n\n“We wish Enzo well for the future.”\n\nThe Italian had a contract until 2029, with an option for an extra year, but his employment at Chelsea has now ended by mutual agreement.\n\nRosenior is highly rated by the Chelsea hierarchy, and has long been earmarked as a future coach. It is felt that this is why he was initially put in at Strasbourg, who are also owned by the Chelsea ownership, where admiration for his work has only increased.\n\nThere has already been progress by the club with Rosenior, but the ownership want to ensure that there is a clear succession at Strasbourg to continue the French club’s good performance this season.\n\nAndoni Iraola is also an option, and his Bournemouth side’s 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge may now prove to be Maresca’s last game. That result made it just one win in seven games for Chelsea, with tension only increasing when the Italian said he felt too unwell to do his post-game press conference.\n\nThere also remains bafflement about how he dropped in the comment about the “worst 48 hours” and his aggravation with “many people”, before refusing to explain what any of it meant.\n\nOther sources say Maresca himself had become increasingly irritated with elements of the Chelsea project and how the football side is run. He is said to want more power over recruitment decisions, but the club do not want to change the current “head coach” structure.\n\nThey also do not like the idea of mid-season coaching changes after the chaos of 2022-23, which saw Thomas Tuchel depart for Graham Potter, before the latter left in March.\n\nSky Sports later reported that the decision to part ways with Maresca stemmed from a breakdown in the relationship between the manager and the club’s hierarchy.\n\nAs part of the coverage for Liverpool versus Leeds, Dave Jones reported that an unofficial briefing from Chelsea explained how Maresca had ‘a lack of mental fortitude and emotional maturity’.\n\nJones said: \"The 48 hour comment was directed at the medical team at Stamford Bridge that he wasn't happy with. There is a suggestion Maresca went against the advice of the medical team at Chelsea on a number occasions. Playing players returning from injury longer than advised, leading to them being re-injured this season.\n\n\"He did not face the media on Tuesday and he wasn't ill we are being told. It is also being briefed that he spoke to Manchester City and Juventus since October. Despite briefing the club [Chelsea], they thought it was disrespectful.\n\n\"The feeling at Chelsea is that he has a lack of mental fortitude and emotional maturity.\"\n\nThe Italian departs with the club fifth in the Premier League table – 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal – following one win from their last seven top-flight games. Chelsea return to action on Sunday away to City, the first of nine fixtures across four competitions during a packed January schedule.",

    "fullText": "The summer transfer window saw 25 players move between Serie A and the Premier League, with 12 moving to England and 13 to Italy. Here is a reminder of who they all were.\n\nTijjani Reijnders was the biggest mover between Serie A and Premier League clubs over the summer transfer window. If all add-ons are included and all bonuses met, the Dutchman’s move from Milan to Manchester City could end up surpassing the €70m mark.\n\nAmong the notable movers from Serie A to the Premier League in the summer was Bologna’s Coppa Italia hero Dan Ndoye, who joined Nottingham Forest for a fee in the region of €40m. Milan sold centre-back Malick Thiaw to Newcastle United for a fee that was also reported to be worth €40m all-in.\n\nOfficial: Malick Thiaw joins Newcast;e United from Milan.\n\nMilan sold or loaned more players to the Premier League than any other Serie A club. Alex Jimenez was sent to AFC Bournemouth, while Samuel Chukwueze has found form with Fulham.\n\nOf the players moving in the opposite direction, Napoli’s signing of Kevin De Bruyne, technically a free agent after his 11 years with Manchester City, was one of the most exciting pieces of business over the summer.\n\nThere was also a lot of excitement to see Jamie Vardy have a go in Serie A after he left Leicester City and ended up joining newly-promoted Cremonese on a free transfer.\n\nVERONA, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 15: Jamie Vardy of US Cremonese looks on during the Serie A match between Hellas Verona FC and US Cremonese at Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi on September 15, 2025 in Verona, Italy.

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Aston Villa at Villa Park (kick-off 12:30 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\nOn team news: \"Mostly good, there's a few carrying a few knocks, but we're hopeful. Ola [Aina] comes back into the group as well, so it's good.\"\n\nDyche revealed he had \"conversations\" with Howard Webb, the head of PGMOL, following Forest's 2-1 defeat by Manchester City, adding that while there were \"some minor disagreements\", it was nothing more \"than just a chat\". He added: \"It's always a game of opinions. VAR is a big talking point, and there are some challenges to VAR and the nature of some decisions. I didn't think ours were particularly difficult, as I said afterwards, and I still stand by that.\"\n\nDyche said the \"biggest challenge\" for his side is being clinical, noting that \"everyone's wanting their players to be clinical, everyone's wanting to score goals and everyone wants goalscorers\".\n\nOn his tenure at Forest so far: \"We're in a better position than when I got here, and also the Europa League, but concentrate on the Premier League for now - there's a building process. I think we've done some good work, and the players have as well, and then it's the ups and downs of it. They're all minor things, but they all count. All of a sudden, you've lost three when it could have been certainly a couple [of wins], if not three draws. So it's frustrating in that respect because of the softness of the goals and not finding that real killer moment to open up the opposition.\"\n\nDyche reiterated that the only way out of their current predicament is by \"doing the work, doing the hard yards on the training pitch, putting them into practice\", stressing that it is \"always a work in progress\".\n\nOn facing Aston Villa: \"He's [Unai Emery] done a great job as a manager there. Their recruitment has been good - spent a lot of money, to be fair, on some very good players and they've moulded it into a good unit, so certainly a tough game.\"\n\nDyche added: \"We've just shown lately, we've taken on some of the bigger teams, or the ones that are fancied every year, and done very well against them - and a couple of teams maybe not as fancied, we haven't done as well against them. That's probably the challenge of the group - rising to the expectation of each game rather than just big games\".",

    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca could leave his post before Sunday's match against Manchester City, with relations between the Italian and the club's hierarchy having deteriorated.\n\nThe Blues have won just once in their past seven Premier League matches and sit fifth in the table - 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal.\n\nAfter their most recent game - a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on 30 December - assistant manager Willy Caballero said Maresca felt too unwell to speak to the media, but it is understood his absence was more due to him considering his next steps.\n\nThere are reports of a board meeting on New Year's Day to address the situation.\n\nThough they have fallen off the pace in the league, Chelsea have reached the Carabao Cup semi-finals, are preparing to restart their Champions League campaign and will face Charlton in the FA Cup third round.\n\nAt the end of November, Chelsea appeared in a harmonious place, with the team third in the Premier League and having recently dismantled Barcelona in the Champions League.\n\nJust one league win followed in December but it is not just results that added to the focus on Maresca, with fissures emerging between the Italian and the club's hierarchy.\n\nMaresca stunned key figures at the club - and even his own staff - when, after beating Everton 2-0 for Chelsea's solitary Premier League win in December, he said \"many people\" had made it his \"worst 48 hours\" since joining the club.\n\nThose comments came from a position of strength after a good performance but were viewed dimly by the club hierarchy, at whom they appeared to be aimed.\n\nDespite that, the plan remained to conduct an end-of-season review to decide whether to move forward with Maresca or part company.\n\nThose with knowledge of Maresca's views, though, said he was capable of walking away having grown unhappy at a multitude of factors, including encouragement to pick certain players, and a lack of protection from the club about the quality of his work.\n\nAll of which has made for an unsettling situation, with Chelsea - whose players will return to work on Friday - closer in points to 15th place than third in the Premier League.\n\nThey next face Manchester City to start a difficult month that also includes games against Arsenal and Napoli.\n\nAnd it is possible - before that potentially definining period - that Maresca will not be in charge.\n\nChelsea's primary goal this season is to qualify for the Champions League, which remains realistic, while also aiming for domestic cup runs.\n\nChelsea were satisfied with Maresca at the end of last season when he delivered Champions League qualification - regarded internally as his most important achievement - plus success in the Conference League and Club World Cup.\n\nWhile victory in Europe's third-tier competition was broadly expected, beating Paris St-Germain to be crowned 'world champions' was a welcome surprise.\n\nMaresca had delighted key figures at Stamford Bridge - including sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Lawrence Stewart, and influential co-owner Behdad Eghbali.\n\nIn line with the agreed strategy when the Italian moved from Leicester City in 2024 - for which the club paid £10m - he focused on coaching the team while those above him oversaw much of the backroom staff, medical department and transfers.\n\nTheir transfer policy - signing the world's best young players from 'lesser' leagues to create the youngest team in the Premier League - remains in place.\n\nMaresca knew what he was signing up for - and his issues are not about the quality of players or the strategy, but about the perception of his work with a young group.\n\nThe Italian is encouraged to rotate his squad, but often feels that when he does so in the Premier League, they drop points. He has also openly urged reporters to question the club's hierarchy.\n\nThose familiar with his thinking say he has defended his work because he believes he is performing better than many have acknowledged, given the squad's age. He also feels the club should have offered him stronger protection from criticism.\n\nMaresca also wanted to take on some external engagements following the club's recent successes. He had floated the idea of publishing a book but was blocked by the club, and spoke at Il Festival dello Sport - an event in Italy organised by La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper - without their permission.\n\nHe also made public that he disagreed with the club not signing a central defender after Levi Colwill injured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season. The club's hierarchy explained that doing so could prompt academy prospect Josh Acheampong to request a transfer, which ultimately led Maresca to back down.\n\nThose close to Maresca, who has switched agents from the Wasserman agency to Jorge Mendes, say he is weighing up his future. He has been mooted as a potential successor to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, which Maresca described as \"100% speculation\".\n\nIn addition, he has increasingly avoided wearing club tracksuits, opting instead for his own clothing.\n\nChelsea face a packed January schedule across four competitions.\n\nThey begin with Sunday's Premier League trip to the Etihad, with a series of London derbies - home and away - against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Brentford, and West Ham before the end of the month.\n\nIn addition, they have an FA Cup third-round tie away to Charlton, a Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal, and two Champions League fixtures - at home to Pafos and away to Napoli.\n\nChelsea realistically need to win both European games to avoid the play-off round and secure a top-eight finish in the league phase.\n\nThe fifth place they occupy in the Premier League may be enough to secure a return to the Champions League for the 2026-27 season.\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Apparently all it takes to win in the Premier League is playing away from home.",
    "fullText": "Winning ugly is better than not winning at all, and apparently Tottenham Hotspur has found the right formula to squeak out three points. After the blip against Forest, Spurs got the needed result against Palace last weekend — away from home, of course — and can start off the new year right with a similar effort at Thomas Frank’s old stomping grounds. Despite plenty of struggles this fall, Tottenham entered this matchweek just four points off fifth.\n\nOne point above Frank’s new side is his previous squad. Since falling to Spurs in North London less than a month ago, Brentford has taken seven points in three matches and surged up the table. Some of this is due to quality of competition, but Tottenham is in no place to scoff at taking the “easy” points. This is going to be a true test on New Year’s but at least there is some reason to believe.\n\nDate: Thursday, January 1\nTime: 3:00 pm ET, 8:00 pm UK\nLocation: Gtech Community Stadium, Brentford\nTV: NBCSN/Peacock (US), Sky Sports Premier League (UK)\nTable: Brentford (t-9th, 26 pts), Spurs (t-13th, 25 pts)\n\nEven with it happening at home, last month’s win over Brentford was Tottenham’s best league performance in a long time. The 2.2-0.2 xG line was certainly the most dominant this campaign, and those figures were completely justified given how the match played out. That win did make it four straight for Spurs in this fixture, regardless of which club Frank is leading.\n\nNo midweek matches the past two weeks gave Frank a chance to deploy all his resources, possibly revealing his preferred choices. Two players stand out as being on either side of the cusp right now. The first is Archie Gray, who has started seven of the last eight fixtures and nabbed his first career goal over the weekend.\n\nSpurs could certainly use an upgrade in central midfield, but if the personnel remains the same, it sure looks like Gray has broken into the Rodrigo Bentancur-Joao Palhinha double pivot, and rightfully so. Gray played well against Brentford last time and would relish the chance to repeat that performance. Keith Andrews has dabbled with his formations since that meeting, but Gray is a strong choice against any midfield combination.\n\nUp top, Richarlison has been the primary Tottenham striker all season, but more so out of necessity than performance. He does now lead the team in goals and could have had two more at Selhurst Park, but he has not exactly sealed up the job. Though a striker signing is unlikely in January, the impending return of Dominic Solanke could push him to the bench; the Brazilian’s chances to hang on to the starting spot are quickly dwindling.\n\nThat 2-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was just about everything Frank could have asked for against his former club. Spurs were surprisingly direct, aided by a start from Xavi Simons and a quality outing from Mohammed Kudus, with both working well in front of Gray and Bentancur. Brentford had nearly equal possession of the ball but generated just one shot on target, rarely threatening the Tottenham defense.\n\nBrentford will obviously look to adjust from this loss — and has looked pretty good since then — while Spurs will try to anticipate some of these changes. Frank should have the advantage, knowing his previous outfit well, though execution plays just as large of a role as tactics. Tottenham’s win over Palace was no masterclass, but the ability to grind out wins on the road should not be overlooked.\n\nI would expect the Bees to really go for this one. With six goals scored and just one conceded the past two weeks, confidence is high in Brentford. Spurs will need to absorb some pressure while also making the most of their chances (especially the aforementioned Richarlison). This does not feel like another 1-0 contest, so maybe Tottenham can take advantage of the home side’s surge in form and ambition, carrying forward last month’s success.",

Your first loan can be testing at times, but we are confident in his mindset, professionalism and ability to handle any challenges that come his way. We wish Iwan the very best of luck for this next step in his development”\n\nMorgan becomes the latest B-team player to go out on loan this season, following Ethan Brierley, Benjamin Fredrick, Tony Yogane and Ben Krauhaus.",

    "fullText": "Is that it, then? Was Aston Villa's Premier League title run a three-week wonder, a fantasy bookended by two games against Arsenal?\n\nPerhaps. But it doesn't matter. It is too early to tell for sure - and let me nod to David Michael's complaint on this page on Wednesday, suggesting all talk of titles is too early at this stage anyway. Unai Emery himself would no doubt also endorse that view.\n\nSo, let's qualify it a little and say Villa were being spoken of as contenders to Arsenal and Manchester City on account of having shown not only their ability to beat both those sides, but also to string together victories when playing well and when they weren't. Perhaps the title chatter is better viewed as a tacit acknowledgement that Villa may be ready to break out of the upper-middle group of Premier League clubs and bridge across to the top bracket.\n\nThe most significant factor holding them back may be squad depth, and there was evidence of this at Emirates Stadium.\n\nFor Arsenal, Gabriel scored on his first start for seven weeks and Gabriel Jesus built up his return from injury with his first goal in almost a year. In contrast, while Villa have handled injuries to Pau Torres and Tyrone Mings well enough, suspensions for Matty Cash and Boubacar Kamara pulled more players away from their ideal positions. Amadou Onana's tight hamstring at half-time stretched the elastic a little too far.\n\nEven though the final result was conclusive, Villa had made Arsenal fret in the first 45 minutes. One sharper finish might have given Villa a half-time lead and changed the character of the match decisively.\n\nBut all is not lost. Far from it.\n\nSaturday's game against Nottingham Forest will tell us more about whether Villa have been knocked far off balance by the second half at the Emirates. A confident showing in that game would confirm they are still capable of chasing the leaders hard in the second part of the season.\n\nThe longer-term view is more important, however. Villa start the new year third in the Premier League and well placed to reach the knockout stage of the Europa League. Their objectives for the campaign are clearly within range.\n\nVilla have begun each previous new year under Emery well positioned to take the club further forward, and the same is true at the dawn of 2026.\n\nListen to full commentary of Aston Villa v Nottingham Forest at 12:30 GMT on Saturday on BBC Radio WM (95.6FM/DAB/Freeview 714)\n\nExplore Aston Villa content on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "As 2026 begins, the wait for a verdict on the Premier League’s charges against Manchester, or the ‘115‘ as they are commonly known, continues. The independent panel which heard the case is yet to deliver its verdict on the affair. The best word to sum up the entire process is frustrating. It is a subject that has rumbled away in the background to matters on the pitch for far too long. Speaking yesterday ahead of Manchester City’s upcoming Premier League fixture against Sunderland, Pep Guardiola shared his frustration with the wait for a verdict on the matter to be delivered. Pep Guardiola’s assessment sums the entire matter up for me. It is now a topic that has drifted away as time goes on.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, ahead of Manchester City’s clash with Sunderland, Pep Guardiola shared his frustration with the wait for a verdict in Manchester City’s case. City is charged with breaching the Premier League’s financial regulations over a prolonged period of time. When asked about the wait, in quotes relayed by Manchester Evening News, Pep Guardiola said: “It’s the same question I ask you, so I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe you have better info than me. You don’t have?”\n\n“I would love to have it, but I don’t know. I don’t know. The same answer to your question is the same you answered me one, two, three years ago. So they must be so busy.”\n\nWho knows when the verdict on the ‘115’ will arrive. There has been constant speculation that a verdict is ‘imminent’ for some time now. But as we enter 2026 the wait for the verdict continues. Pep Guardiola summed it up best when he shared his frustration with the wait. That is the feelings of many on the topic.\n\nUntil the ‘115’ verdict arrives it is wasted energy for me. I’d rather focus on matters on the pitch, in the transfer market and any other matter that surrounds Manchester City. The ‘115’ has dragged on for too long and frankly it is a matter that has drifted out of view for now. When a verdict arrives, that will thrust the topic back into the spotlight. When that will be, no one knows but Pep Guardiola’s assessment on the matter is on money.",
