    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles are losing passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach Christian Parker. Not ideal.\n\nEven worse, he’s joining the Dallas Cowboys as their new defensive coordinator. This much according to a report from NFL insider Tom Pelissero.\n\nWe knew this outcome was possible; Parker recently drew DC interviews from Dallas and the Green Bay Packers. Really, the Eagles were fortunate to be able to retain him for 2025 after he drew interest from the New Orleans Saints last year.\n\nLosing Parker was likely inevitable. Losing him to a division rival isn’t very fun. Unless he proves to be a double agent, which I wouldn’t count on.\n\nWe previously touched on Parker’s value:\n\nThe 34-year-old Parker has a strong track record of getting the best out of his players. He notably oversaw the development of Patrick Surtain II with the Denver Broncos before coming to Philly and coaching Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean to All-Pro status in their second seasons.\n\nThe Eagles have had one of the best defenses in the NFL since they hired him along with Vic Fangio during the 2024 offseason. The team would probably like to retain him, especially since he could potentially be a Fangio successor one day. But it’s quite possible — if not outright likely — that Parker will be poached before that can happen.\n\nIt’s possible that Parker is a good position coach but not a good defensive coordinator. And Dallas has a long way to go in remaking their talent on that side of the ball after it was such a disastrous unit under Matt Eberflus in 2025.\n\nBut it’ll be pretty annoying for the Eagles if Parker helps the Cowboys turn things around in a big way.\n\nAnyway, it remains to be seen how the Birds will replace Parker. They currently have a cornerbacks coach in Roy Anderson and a safeties coach in Joe Kasper. Will there be an internal promotion or will they look to make an external hire? Perhaps a combination of both if there’s some backfilling to be done? We’ll see.",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Trevon Diggs cut from the Packers after two games",
    "description": "The latest news and notes around the Dallas Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "The former Dallas Cowboys All-Pro cornerback will have to find a new home in 2026.\n\nTrevon Diggs‘ brief stint with the Packers came to an unceremonious but expected end on Tuesday.\n\nGreen Bay released the cornerback and announced the move among a batch of forward-facing roster changes that included a pair of futures contracts. Diggs is now subject to waivers. If he clears them, which is likely, he’ll be a free agent.\n\nA six-year NFL veteran, Diggs latched on with the Packers at the end of the 2025 regular season, starting in their finale at Minnesota and recording two tackles before playing one snap in Green Bay’s Wild Card Weekend loss to Chicago.\n\nDiggs made his way to Green Bay only after Dallas abruptly parted ways with the former All-Pro defender in late December in a move that was reportedly the culmination of multiple factors over time, including performance and other components. The decision came less than three years after the Cowboys signed Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension that preceded a season-ending ACL injury in 2023 and a tumultuous journey that followed both on and off the field.\n\nDiggs’ contract — a lucrative agreement that became a bloated one due to his lack of production — already placed him on a track to be released after the 2025 season. Instead of waiting for the offseason, the Cowboys decided to cut ties in December, freeing Diggs to join a title-contending squad with the expectation he’d likely be released by his new team after their season ended.\n\nGreen Bay did exactly that on Tuesday, freeing up the entirety of the $15 million he was scheduled to account for in cap space in 2026. Diggs faces an uncertain future as heads to free agency, but will have a head start on finding a new home prior to the start of the new league year in March.\n\nIf Brian Schottenheimer has a year two jump like Mike Macdonald, they will be in the NFC Championship.\n\nThe Cowboys are in the second phase of their interviews to replace defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said earlier this offseason that he threw a party when they hired Eberflus. A year later, Eberflus was fired after directing the defense that allowed the most points in franchise history.\n\nThe Cowboys have completed in-person interviews with two candidates so far: Minnesota defensive passing game coordinator Daronte Jones and former Arizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon, who was the defensive coordinator in Philadelphia before his three seasons in Arizona. Jones has become a popular name across a league that features many defensive coordinator openings. He’s expected to interview with the New York Giants and Green Bay Packers after also interviewing with the New York Jets.\n\nThe Cowboys are also expected to interview Philadelphia defensive passing game coordinator Christian Parker on Wednesday. In addition, don’t be surprised if the Cowboys try to interview Denver defensive passing game coordinator Jim Leonhard after the AFC Championship Game on Sunday. Because the Cowboys already interviewed Leonhard, they can interview him again even if the Broncos win and advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nAs of now, the Cowboys appear to be sticking to a process that they want to perform at their own pace.\n\n“I’ve done it with consensus since the first day I walked through the door here,” Jones said about the hiring process. “We’ll do it the same way we hired [Eberflus]. We’ll do it together and come up with as good as we can.”\n\nAs the Seahawks have shown, it can get pretty good with the right defensive play-caller.\n\nMike Macdonald was a rising young defensive coordinator before the Seahawks hired him to be their head coach in 2024. For good reason. In his final season as the Ravens defensive coordinator, for example, Baltimore became the first team in NFL history to lead in scoring defense, takeaways and sacks.\n\nThe Cowboys hit another home run along the offensive line in the draft.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cowboys rookie guard Tyler Booker was named to the Pro Football Writers Association’s All-Rookie team.\n\nBooker becomes the first Cowboy to earn a spot on the roster since 2022, when his fellow offensive lineman Tyler Smith got the nod as a tackle.\n\nIn his rookie season, Booker started in all 15 games he played in at right guard, missing two games due to a high ankle sprain that he returned from quickly. He filled the slot that was left open by future Hall of Famer Zack Martin, who retired after the 2024 season following 11 years with the Cowboys.\n\nAmong all rookies with at least 500 pass blocking snaps, Booker ranked third among all offensive linemen in pressure rate (5.9%) and allowed the lowest QB pressures (17) and second-lowest sacks (1.5) when facing a defender one-on-one.\n\nIn the run game, the area Booker specialized in out of college at Alabama, he helped Dallas’ offensive line pave the way for an average of 125.6 yards per game on the ground, the ninth-highest average in the league.\n\nAfter the season concluded, his fellow guard on the other side of the line, Pro Bowler Tyler Smith, called Booker one of the best rookies he’s ever seen.\n\n“I think his [Year 2] jump could be astronomical, bro,” Smith said. “I’ll be honest: he’s one of the best rookies, at least in my time here, and I’m only a Year 4, but he’s one of the best rookies we ever had.”\n\nNow, Booker will look to take that astronomical step in his second season. How does he see that happening? Consistency.\n\n“I’ll go out there and have plays where I kind of think that I look like Tyler Smith. Then I have plays where I look like the rookie that I am,” Booker said. “So just cutting out those little rookie plays, I like to call them, and just continue to dominate and really take games over.”\n\nDallas has one more interview set for this week before fans set their sights on what will happen with Jim Leonhard.\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon, Jonathan Gannon, the former coach of the Arizona Cardinals, finished up interviews with the Cowboys front office and coach Brian Schottenheimer for the vacant defensive coordinator position at The Star.\n\nOn Wednesday, Eagles passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach Christian Parker will visit.\n\nAfter that, the Cowboys have no more in-person interviews scheduled, two people with knowledge of the process told The Dallas Morning News.\n\nThe Cowboys have invited three coaches for in-person interviews. Last Saturday, Daronté Jones, the Vikings’ defensive backs coach/passing game coordinator, was the first in-person interview.\n\nAnd now, after Gannon and the expected discussion with Parker, it would appear the Cowboys might be done.\n\nHowever, Jim Leonhard, the Broncos’ defensive passing game/assistant head coach, remains on the team’s radar. Leonhard has conducted a virtual interview with club officials but hasn’t come to Texas for an in-person chat.\n\nLeonhard’s team is in the AFC Championship Game and, based on league rules, if he does any in-person interviews, they must conclude by Saturday.\n\nNFL teams have Tuesdays off during a game week, and if Leonhard were to visit the Cowboys it likely would have been then. Yet, the team interviewed Gannon.\n\nSo if Leonhard visits the Cowboys, it might happen late Friday or early Saturday so he could get back to Denver in time for Sunday’s game.\n\nOf course, if the Broncos get eliminated from the postseason, he could interview for the Cowboys’ job if it’s still available.",

    "fullText": "The Professional Football Writers of America have revealed their choices for the 2025 All-Rookie Team, with one Cowboys player being recognized for excellence in his first year.\n\nGuard Tyler Booker has earned a coveted spot on the all-rookie roster. The 21-year-old was the Cowboys' first-round draft pick back in April, being selected No. 12 overall out of Alabama. He started 14 games as a rookie and played every offensive snap in each of those appearances, missing three games early in the season with a high ankle sprain.\n\nHe's the first Cowboys first-year player named to the squad since Tyler Smith was chosen in 2022.\n\nBooker is joined on the 2026 All-Rookie Team by standouts like Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson, Buccaneers wide receiver Emeka Egbuka, Colts tight end Tyler Warren, Giants defensive lineman Abdul Carter, Eagles linebacker Jihaad Campbell, and Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori.\n\nBrowns linebacker Carson Schwesinger was named Defensive Rookie of the Year; Panthers wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan is this season's Offensive Rookie of the Year and the 2025 Rookie of the Year.\n\nFormer Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons won 2021's Rookie of the Year honors. Other franchise legends like Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Dorsett preceded him in the first-year awards that have been handed out by the PFWA every season since 1974.\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

    "description": "Robert Saleh has history with Cowboys d-line coach Aaron Whitecotton",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans have just made 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh their next head coach. That may seem like a weird news post for a Cowboys blog, but the ripple effect could impact Dallas’ search for its next defensive boss. Current defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, who is among the interviewed candidates for the DC job, may be on Saleh’s wishlist for his staff in Tennessee.\n\nWhen Saleh was the head coach of the New York Jets from 2021-2024, Whitecotton was his defensive line coach. After Saleh was fired two years ago, Whitecotton was able to make the lateral move to coach the defensive front in Dallas. He was attractive to the Cowboys based on excellent results with the Jets’ defense, particularly helping Quinnen Williams to become an All-Pro talent among other strong performers. When Dallas traded for Williams last October, he was clearly excited to reunite with Whitecotton.\n\nThe relationship between Saleh and Whitecotton runs deeper than the Jets tenure. They were both part of Gus Bradley’s staff in Jacksonville from 2014-2016, when Saleh was the linebackers coach and Whitecotton was just getting started as a d-line assistant. When Saleh left to become the 49ers’ DC, Whitecotton ended up in Buffalo for a few years. But Saleh brought him on staff in 2020, and then Whitecotton followed him to New York the following year. So there’s already been a point where, after time apart, they started working together again.\n\nGiven all this history, it would be no surprise if Saleh would like to resume their collaboration. But for that to happen, it would likely only come by making him the Jets’ defensive coordinator. Whitecotton is still under contract with Dallas and, unlike most other assistants, wasn’t one of Matt Eberflus’ guys. Considering the Cowboys have considered him for their own DC vacancy, they will almost certainly be retaining him as the defensive line coach at the very least. In that case, the only way New York could get him without Dallas’ consent is through a promotion.\n\nThe hire makes sense beyond just the relationship. Saleh has already made it clear that he plans to be the defensive play-caller in Tennessee. That could be attractive to Whitecotton as a first-time coordinator, allowing him to focus more on the other duties of the job initially. Saleh likely intends to be very hands-on with the defense in multiple ways, so a new coordinator with an existing rapport would be a great fit for that.\n\nAdmittedly, we are making the assumption that Robert Saleh would want Aaron Whitecotton back, and that Whitecotton would want to work for him. Hopefully, if they do reunite, it means the Cowboys only have to replace their defensive line coach. We don’t know where Whitecotton ranked on their list of defensive coordinator candidates, with plenty of outside guys being interviewed as well. But as this coaching carousel continues to spin, this is one horse that could impact what happens in Dallas and is worth watching.",

The Dallas job came open shortly after the end of the regular season when the Cowboys fired Matt Eberflus (yes, the former Chicago Bears’ head coach) from the job.\n\nCovington does have past experience as a DC, serving in that capacity for the New England Patriots during the 2024 season. That tenure ended when head coach Jerod Mayo was fired, and it immediately preceded his arrival in Green Bay last offseason.\n\nBecause of that experience, Covington was likely to be a candidate for the DC job in Green Bay if Jeff Hafley were to leave for a head coaching job elsewhere. That possibility may still be on the table, but the Cowboys appear to be getting out ahead of a potential Hafley move.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been searching for a new defensive coordinator for over a week which means that it has been that long since they fired Matt Eberflus from the position in question. While the move became official on the second day of the offseason, the writing was on the wall for some time relative to Eberflus’ fate. The 2025 Cowboys defense was arguably the worst in franchise history and he had a heavy hand in that.\n\nIn case you are unaware, NFL Films and HBO have been chronicling the second half of this season through the in-season version of Hard Knocks. Like the version that people know and love from the summer that covers a team in training camp, it serves as a fly-on-the-wall documentation of what is happening.\n\nA new episode of the documentary series dropped on Tuesday night and in it Brian Schottenheimer was seen explaining Eberflus’ firing in a Cowboys staff meeting. Shout out to Nick Harris of the FWST for the transcription.\n\nCowboys HC Brian Schottenheimer in a staff meeting last Tuesday telling his assistants that Matt Eberflus was fired, via HBO’s Hard Knocks:\n\n“I just met with Flus early this morning. Incredible human being. I love the man, but at the end of the day, the football wasn’t right.…\n\n— Nick Harris (@NickHarrisFWST) January 14, 2026\n\n“I just met with Flus early this morning. Incredible human being. I love the man, but at the end of the day, the football wasn’t right. I’ve been in this position, I’ve been Flus. I’ve been the guys in this room. I understand the questions. I understand the concerns, and I will answer all of those. Right now the focus has to be, number-one, the man. Reach out, tell him you love him, because he’s a great man. Number-two, finishing this process. The exit interviews with the players are critical. We have to continue that process. We got players rolling in here in a little bit. If anyone has questions, come see me.”\n\nSchotty was not the only person associated with Cowboys leadership to address this on the episode.\n\nJerry Jones offered his thoughts and mentioned that firing Eberflus was among the hardest decisions he has made in his time with the team.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones to Hard Knocks on the decision:\n\n“Our 2025 season was a roller-coaster. We were inconsistent on defense. The Eberflus decision of not going forward with him was one of the hardest that I’ve been involved in during my time with the Dallas Cowboys.

The Eberflus decision of not going forward with him was one of the hardest that I’ve been involved in during my time with the Dallas Cowboys. But at the end of the day, I think it was the thing to do.”\n\nYou can file these statements under “that makes sense, what else are they supposed to say” type of responses. They were kind, Schotty was particularly intent on instructing his staff to show kindness to Eberflus, and professional. That is great to see.\n\nIt sure would be something if we were able to get access to this type of footage regarding the team’s search for a new defensive coordinator!",

    "title": "Cowboys news: DaRon Bland has surgery on his foot for the second time",
    "description": "The latest news and notes around the Dallas Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys need DaRon Bland to be the best version of himself in 2026.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Cowboys CB DaRon Bland underwent successful surgery on his left foot in Indianapolis in a procedure done by Dr. David Porter.\n\nBland played 12 games for the Cowboys in 2025 before being placed on injured reserve for the final three games of the year. He also missed Weeks 2 and 3 of the season with a right foot injury that he suffered in practice.\n\nThe newest surgery marks the second straight year that Bland has had a procedure done on his left foot. In training camp leading into the 2024 season, Bland suffered a fracture in his left foot, which led to the first surgery. He would go on to return and play seven games that season for Dallas.\n\nEvidently, back-to-back seasons ending in surgery on the same foot is not what Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones or anyone wanted for Bland.\n\n“I’m not a doctor… but I don’t like that at all,” Jones said. “I don’t like the sound of that. You have to watch feet, relative to the future.”\n\nIn August, the Cowboys signed Bland to a four-year, $92 million extension, two years removed from an All-Pro season where Bland set the NFL record for most pick-sixes in a season with five in 2023.\n\nDespite two straight years of disappointing injury circumstances cutting Bland’s seasons short, Jones and the Cowboys do not regret signing Bland to his extension that keeps him in Dallas long term.\n\nFinding a replacement for Matt Eberflus won’t solve all the defensive problems from last season.\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of the Dallas Cowboys’ season-ending news conference on Jan. 7, Jerry Jones addressed the two biggest reasons they had a second consecutive losing season for the first time in 23 years. As owner and general manager, no one is more responsible.\n\nThe first one, Jones brought up on his own: Trading Micah Parsons a week before the season started.\n\nThe second, Jones was asked about: Hiring Matt Eberflus as their defensive coordinator.\n\nThe two go hand-in-hand in what ended up being a group that allowed an NFL-high and franchise-record 511 points — almost exactly 30 points per game. They also gave up 377 yards per game, third-worst in the league.\n\nTo illustrate just how bad it was, look at what MVP candidate and New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye did during the regular season: 4,394 passing yards, 31 touchdown passes, 8 interceptions, a 113.5 passer rating while completing 72 percent of his passes.\n\nOpposing quarterbacks against the Cowboys this season:\n\n“It wasn’t the year that we wanted,” defensive tackle Kenny Clark said. “That sucks. And we all got a hand in that. We all got to look at each other critically throughout the offseason and figure some stuff out.”\n\nIf the Cowboys nail their two first-round picks this year, the defense could be turned around in a heartbeat.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys’ season is over, and they have earned the 12th overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Green Bay Packers’ season is also over. They have earned the 20th overall pick in the draft, but that pick goes to the Cowboys thanks to the Micah Parsons trade. That gives Dallas the 12th and 20th picks in the draft. That’s a lot of first-round firepower.\n\nThe last time the Cowboys had two picks in the top 20 was in 2005. Some might remember that as the “defensive draft” as Bill Parcells and company loaded up on defenders. Six of the eight players they drafted that year played defense, with the two offensive guys being RB Marion Barber III (fourth round) and OT Rob Petitti (sixth round). The defensive players the Cowboys selected that year were:\n\nSome of those names should look familiar to you, as most of them hung around the league for a while. Five of those six players played at least nine seasons in the NFL. Three of them played at least eight seasons with the Cowboys. Two of them were All-Pro players with at least four Pro Bowls on their resume. And finally, one of them was a Hall of Fame edge rusher.\n\nThe Cowboys would love to come away with a similar haul. Oddly enough, the team’s draft picks line up similarly to where they were picking back in 2005. They have a top 12 pick, the 20th pick, no second rounder this year because of the Quinnen Williams trade, but then five picks on Day 3 outside the top 100.\n\nWhat is also similar about this is that the three top edge rushers in the draft are currently projected to go in the top 12 picks: Miami’s Rueben Bain, Texas Tech’s David Bailey, and Auburn’s Keldric Faulk. The Cowboys are in a great position to snag one of the best pass rushers coming out of the draft with their 12th overall pick. Expecting him to be a Hall of Famer is quite optimistic, but the chances of landing a top-talent edge rusher the year after losing Parsons are pretty decent. How nice would it be to have a top college edge opposite second-year edge Donovan Ezeiruaku while having guys like Williams, Kenny Clark, and Osa Odighizuwa filling the interior?\n\nThe ever-rotating door of head coaching vacancies could leave candidates out in the open, Dallas never thought would become available.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin informed the team that he was stepping down as head coach. With the news, there will likely be a staff shake-up in Pittsburgh.\n\nThat opens up an option for the Cowboys, with a person familiar with the current staff.\n\nSteelers defensive backs coach Gerald Alexander is someone to keep in mind, as pointed out by Nick Harris of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\n“With Mike Tomlin stepping down and the Steelers out of the playoffs, I’d be curious if Steelers [defensive backs] coach Gerald Alexander gets a look in Dallas for a potential spot on staff,” Harris wrote on X.\n\n“Played at Boise State when Klayton Adams was a [graduate assistant] and played with the Jets in 2011 under Brian Schottenheimer. Was Brian Flores’ [defensive backs] coach in Miami, too.”\n\nAlexander was a second-round pick of the Detroit Lions in the 2007 NFL Draft, also having stints with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Carolina Panthers, Miami Dolphins, and New York Jets before beginning his coaching career as a student assistant at Arkansas State. He continued coaching in the college ranks, before joining Flores’ Dolphins staff. He also served as a safeties coach for the Las Vegas Raiders, before returning to Pittsburgh for a second stint.\n\nIt is certainly a name to watch, especially with Flores being linked to the Cowboys’ defensive coordinator vacancy over the past few weeks. And, as we all know, the Cowboys need desperate help in the secondary, and Schottenheimer is a man who would love to bring in some familiarity.",

    "title": "Cowboys 2025 rookie report: Reviewing Tyler Booker",
    "description": "How do you feel Tyler Booker performed this season?",
    "fullText": "All year long we’ve looked at the rookie class and given previews and reviews on each player for every game of the season. Now let’s look back the season in its entirety and breakdown each rookie and how they performed. Let’s start with first-round offensive guard Tyler Booker.\n\nSeason stats- Snaps: 1,003, Pass Blocks: 631, Pressures: 25, Sacks: 3, Penalties: 7\n\nBooker’s first season in Dallas looks very much like the start of a long-term answer at guard after the departure of Zack Martin. Drafted 12th overall and dropped straight into the starting lineup, he finished his rookie year as the Cowboys’ clear Rookie of the Year and one of the few unquestioned wins on a team that struggled for consistency. Across the season he handled a huge workload in protection and the most of any rookie interior lineman, yet he allowed only three sacks all year. For a first-year right guard that is big-time reliability.\n\nThe advanced numbers back up the eye test. Booker allowed 25 pressures, which puts him inside the top tier of all right guards, not just first-year players. ESPN’s trench metrics chart him with a pass-block win rate around 95%, comfortably above league average for guards and a big reason Dallas ranked in the top half of the league in pass protection despite broader offensive struggles.\n\nBooker’s work in the run game is just as important. PFF graded him with a 76.8 run blocking grade, that’s seventh-best among all guards this year. You can see his impact in games like the Christmas win over Washington, where the Cowboys piled up 211 rushing yards and repeatedly gashed the interior. Even late in the year when most rookies hit the wall, Booker was still there helping the offense to 143 rushing yards at 4.8 yards per carry against the New York Giants. He wasn’t a perfect finisher on every snap, but the pattern was clear, when Dallas wanted to run between the tackles, they were happy to run behind him.\n\nThere were bumps along the way. Early in the season he suffered a high-ankle sprain, missed time, and came back in Week 7 still finding his rhythm. In his first three NFL starts he allowed nine total pressures, and even later in the year there were games where stunts and late movement bothered him and where his penalties cropped up in bad spots. Coaches, and Booker himself, talked about consistency as the main lesson from year one. That lines up with the numbers where three sacks and 25 pressures on that many pass-block reps is excellent, but seven penalties and some rough stretches after the injury give him obvious points to attack in his second season.\n\nNFL.com placed him among the top rookies of the 2025 class, and coaches have repeatedly called him a foundational piece in the middle of the Cowboys’ line. When you put it all together – league-leading pass-pro volume for a rookie, solid run-blocking and resilience coming back from a high-ankle sprain – the story of his season is simple to tell. Booker didn’t just survive his rookie year, he nailed it and played like the long-term starting guard Dallas hoped they were getting, with only polish and discipline standing between him and a genuine Pro Bowl conversation in 2026.",

    "description": "We continue to wait to see what the Cowboys will do at defensive coordinator.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys did their first round of interviews for their next defensive coordinator over the weekend. While the front office said they would cast a wide net during the search, there is a rumor the team could already have its eye on who will replace Matt Eberflus.\n\nCowboys insider Bobby Belt for Shan & RJ on 105.3 The Fan had an update Monday morning on where things stand with the team and their vacancy at the coordinator position. Here is what he texted Shan:\n\n“I texted Bobby last night and I said is there any update, any movement? And he said ‘Nope. They wrapped those three interviews. Will probably submit more today or tomorrow. Would not be surprised if they request Jonathan Cooley from the Panthers, but I think [Jim] Leonhard will be their guy. So they have to wait for Denver to get bounced before they can hire him.’”\n\nLeonhard completed his virtual interview with Dallas on Saturday. With the Denver Broncos set to host the Buffalo Bills this week, the Cowboys will have to wait at least one week to move forward with Leonhard if he’s their guy, assuming the Broncos lose Saturday. Until then, that doesn’t mean the team can’t continue interviewing other candidates to make sure there’s no one else who could impress them more than Leonhard.\n\nBelt also mentioned Carolina Panthers pass game coordinator Jonathan Cooley as a potential name the team could request to interview. While nothing has been confirmed, Cooley fits the criteria Dallas appears to be looking for in its next defensive coordinator.\n\nLeonhard, Daronte Jones, and now Cooley are all involved in the passing game. Ephraim Banda, the Cleveland Browns’ safeties coach, also has experience working with the secondary. By the end of the season, Jerry Jones was open about how much he was disappointed in the secondary play this year.\n\nThe hope was that the team would be able to mitigate the loss of Jourdan Lewis (which Jones said they underestimated) by having DaRon Bland kick back inside to the slot, along with a healthy Trevon Diggs on the outside, and a mix of Kaiir Elam and Caelen Carson opposite him. Outside of Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas’ dream scenario never came together.\n\nWith Bland having a second surgery on his foot, Diggs being shown the door, and Shavon Revel having a down year as a rookie, the Cowboys could end up overhauling their entire secondary. Having a defensive coordinator with a wealth of experience in that area could be the first step in solving those issues, along with two first-round picks in the upcoming draft.",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Former Dallas 1st-round pick weighs in on who should be next DC",
    "description": "Your Sunday morning Cowboys news.",
    "fullText": "Ex-Cowboy has a daring take of who should be their next defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are on the hunt for a new defensive coordinator after Matt Eberflus was fired less than 48 hours after the season finale loss against the New York Giants. Former Cowboys defensive end Marcus Spears has a solution that fans may like, and it makes sense.\n\nOn ESPN’s NFL Live, Marcus Spears was asked who should be the Cowboys’ next defensive coordinator, and he didn’t hesitate to name former Atlanta Falcons head coach Raheem Morris. Spears pointed to Morris’ history of developing defensive backs, and Morris has already emerged as a popular candidate to help fix one of the NFL’s worst defenses in 2025.\n\n“Coverage is a big thing for Raheem, and if you notice, every place that he’s been, defensive coordinator-wise or head coach, he’s always had a star corner,” Spears said. “That’s just what he believes in.”\n\nMarcus Spears advocates for Raheem Morris to be Cowboys’ next defensive coordinator\n\nMorris has had defensive success everywhere he’s been for more than two decades. He was the defensive quality control coach during the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Super Bowl run back in the 2002 season, where he coached Hall of Fame secondary players like John Lynch, Ronde Barber and Super Bowl 37 MVP, Dexter Jackson.\n\nMorris was also the defensive coordinator for the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams back in the 2021 season. It helped to have a monster like Aaron Donald controlling the line of scrimmage, but it’s no coincidence that Morris has been a part of multiple Super Bowl defenses.\n\nGeorge Pickens gets a just reward.\n\nIn his first season with the Cowboys, wide receiver George Pickens wasn’t just trying to benefit from having a fresh start, but was eyeing a big season in his “contract year” knowing he’d be a free agent in March. Not only did Pickens produce his best season with career-highs in every major category, but now he can add All-Pro to his list of accomplishments, that also saw him make his first Pro Bowl. Pickens is one of three Cowboys to earn second-team All-Pro honors by The Associated Press (AP). The list was announced on Saturday and also included a pair of special teams standouts.\n\nKicker Brandon Aubrey and return specialist KaVontae Turpin were also second-team All-Pros. Pickens was behind first-seamers Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Ja’Marr Chase. Aubrey was on the second-team behind Vikings kicker Will Reichard and Turpin finished behind Buffalo’s Ray Davis.\n\nThis is the second year in a row the Cowboys landed a receiver, kicker and returner on the AP All-Pro teams. Last year, CeeDee Lamb and Turpin were first-teamers and Aubrey made the second-team. For Aubrey, he’s been selected on the All-Pro squad in each of his first three seasons in the NFL. In 2023, he was a first-team selection.\n\nAubrey was 36-of-42 on field goals, with all six misses occurring from 50 yards or more. He did make a 64-yard field goal as time expired in regulation, sending a Week 2 game vs. the Giants to overtime. Aubrey then became the first kicker in NFL history to make field goals to end regulation and overtime, helping Dallas to a 40-37 win.\n\nCould Quinnen’s brother make a good add?\n\nEvery offseason it seems like I see a linebacker’s name pop up that the Cowboys need to get to help the defense. This year it may be Quincy Williams. Could he be the guy the middle of the defense is missing? I’ve seen some reactions, and when you dig into the type of player he is the coverage numbers may make you second guess. And honestly, I get it because it doesn’t look pretty. When you actually dig into how Quincy Williams plays, and how he is used, the conversation changes fast. So let’s talk it through like fans, not scouts trying to sound smart.\n\nThe First Thing You Need to Know: This Dude Lives in the Box\n\nQuincy Williams is not a coverage linebacker, and he never has been. He will not be floating around in space trying to run with slot receivers or carry tight ends down the seams. When you look at the snap data, it’s not even debatable. He spent hundreds of snaps in the box, very few on the edge, only a handful in the slot, and almost none on the outside.\n\nThat tells you exactly how defenses should play him.  He is there to attack downhill. If you judge this man based on coverage stats alone, you’re grading a fish on how well it climbs trees. How Quincy Williams Actually Plays\n\nWhat I like about Quincy Williams is simple: when he sees it, he goes. There’s no dancing, no waiting for someone else to make the play. He triggers fast and shows up with bad intentions. Is he perfect? Absolutely not, but were any of the Cowboys linebackers last season even above average.\n\nHe will miss a tackle here and there because of his aggressive play style, but I’ll take that every day over a linebacker who catches blocks and gets pancaked. What I found even more impressive was he lines up all over the box. He can play weak side, strong side, and take inside looks, but he rarely just sat in the middle calling things out. He’s a flow-and-hunt guy, so the Cowboys would need to let him scrape, chase, and hit. That is where his game makes sense.\n\nThis may be another area where people will get twisted.  Yes, you will see him walked up near the line sometimes, but he’s not an edge rusher.  He is not winning with moves or stacking sacks. Those snaps are about pressure and confusion to make the offense account for him, mess with protection calls, and let the defense work around it. He’s a blitzer, not a technician, and if used incorrectly, it looks ugly.\n\n“My goal in life is to retire as the owner that won the most Super Bowls,” Jones said with complete seriousness. “That’s my goal.” Not just to win another one. Nope. To have the most of any owner in history. It was actually a shocking admission, given the recent state of the franchise. Jones obviously got off to a blistering start toward that achievement, winning three Lombardi Trophies in his first seven years of ownership, which was a literal lifetime ago.\n\nIt’s been 30 years since he added to that total. Only 10 of the players who finished the season with Dallas were even alive when Jones last won the big one. But now, at 83 years old, he wants to get serious about stockpiling? “How many more do I have to go as a single owner?” he asked the room. [New England’s] Bob [Kraft]’s got how many, six? I’ve got work to do.”\n\nTo be fair, Jones does seem, by all outward appearances, to be in fairly good health. But to suggest that he’s going to keep running the organization he’s always run it… and suddenly do something that hasn’t happened since the original Toy Story was still playing in movie theaters… and then do it THREE MORE TIMES in awfully quick succession seems too pie-in-the-sky for even the most wildly delusional Cowboys fan.\n\nQuite frankly, one more trophy would be a staggeringly earth-shaking development for this franchise under its current power structure. The only thing crazier than Jones coming right out and saying he plans to win four more championships before he “retires” is the fact that it was only the third-craziest thing he said during Wednesday’s press conference.",

    "fullText": "Former Oklahoma State quarterback Zane Flores has committed to Iowa State, via the NCAA Transfer Portal, per On3’s Pete Nakos. Flores spent three seasons with the Cowboys.\n\nFlores began the 2025 campaign as Oklahoma State’s backup QB, but took over starting responsibilities in Week 2 after Hauss Hejny suffered an injury in the season-opener. Flores made nine appearances this past season.\n\nHe completed 59.8% of his pass attempts for 1,490 yards and three touchdowns, while throwing seven interceptions. Additionally, Flores recorded 117 yards and two scores in the ground game.\n\nZane Flores played high school football at Gretna (NE), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 467 overall player and No. 29 QB in the 2023 recruiting cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Rankings.\n\nFlores is the 33rd player who has committed to Iowa State this offseason via the NCAA Transfer Portal. At the time of his commitment to the Cyclones, Flores was the No. 97 QB in On3’s 2026 Transfer Portal Player Rankings.\n\nIowa State is entering a new after longtime head coach Matt Campbell left the program to take over at Penn State. Campbell had been the head coach at Iowa State since 2016. In his 10 seasons at the helm of the program, he amassed a 72-55 overall record and a 50-40 mark in conference play.\n\nIn response to Campbell’s decision, Iowa State hired Jimmy Rogers to be its next head coach. Rogers was Washington State‘s HC in the 2025 campaign. He led the Cougars to a 6-6 overall record.\n\nPrior to his time at the helm of WSU, Rogers was South Dakota State‘s head coach. In just two seasons with the Jackrabbits, he led the program to a 27-3 record and a 15-1 mark in conference play.\n\nMoreover, in 2023, South Dakota State won the FCS National Championship. The team lost in the national semifinals in 2024, but won the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Now, he’ll look to lead Iowa State to similar heights.\n\n“My family and I are excited to be joining the Iowa State University community and the Cyclone football program,” Rogers said. “Iowa State has been one of the nation’s top programs for the last decade and we look forward to building upon its upward trajectory. I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity that Jamie Pollard has given me to lead the Cyclones.”\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "fullText": "The Cowboys are set to begin interviews for their defensive coordinator opening. Just 72 hours after the firing of Matt Eberflus, the team will kick off the conversations to find his replacement with three meetings reportedly over the next two days.\n\nPer NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, the Cowboys will interview Vikings assistant Daronte Jones and Browns assistant Ephraim Banda on Friday, with Broncos assistant Jim Leonhard rounding out the current slate on Saturday.\n\nThe Cowboys had hoped to also speak with Falcons assistant Jeff Ulbrich but was denied permission, as Atlanta reportedly hopes to keep him on staff to serve under their next as-yet-unnamed head coach.\n\n#Cowboys will conduct their 1st round of defensive coordinator interviews today, speaking with #Vikings defensive pass game coordinator Daronte Jones and #Browns safeties coach Ephraim Banda, then they'll speak with #Broncos defensive pass game coordinator Jim Leonhard tomorrow.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 9, 2026\n\nHead coach Brian Schottenheimer said earlier in the week that the process of evaluating their current coaching staff could take \"10 to 12 days,\" but announced a parting of the ways with Eberflus the following day, after a historically poor season that saw the Dallas defense give up a franchise-worst 30 points per game.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones explained in the team's season-ending press conference that neither prior head coaching nor coordinator experience at the pro level would be considered a prerequisite for the current DC job; none of the current candidates have either.\n\nHere's a quick look at the first three interviewees for the role.\n\nJones has been Minnesota's defensive pass game coordinator since 2023 and was the Vikings' defensive backs coach in 2022 and also in 2020 (with a year as LSU's defensive coordinator in between). The 47-year-old is thought to bring a lot of the qualities that the team likes in current Vikings DC Brian Flores. The Jets have also requested permission to interview Jones for their DC job.\n\nBanda, 44, has coached the Browns' safeties since 2023, hired to the job by current defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. Despite the team's 5-12 record this season, Banda safeties Grant Delpit and Ronnie Hickman helped the team put up top-three numbers in passing yards allowed. Prior to Cleveland, Banda spent a dozen years in the college ranks; he worked defensive quality control at Mississippi State in 2015, Dak Prescott's senior year.\n\nLeonhard is considered by many to be a rising star in the coaching world. After 10 years as an NFL safety, he went back to his alma mater of Wisconsin to begin his coaching career and then returned to Denver (where he played in 2012) to be the Broncos' defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator in 2024. Last year, the 43-year-old added assistant head coach to his job duties. Leonhard has history with Brian Schottenheimer; he was a Jet for three years while Schottenheimer was offensive coordinator there.\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

    "fullText": "Remember when it was going to take the Dallas Cowboys 10-12 days to evaluate the 2025 season?\n\nAfter firing defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus after what can only be described as a horror season by any metric you want to use, rumors of who Dallas could target have been flying around.\n\nSeveral high-profile names jumped to the top of the list, including Brian Flores and Jim Schwartz.\n\nWIN the DAK PRESCOTT BOBBLEHEAD By Joining Our COWBOYS COMMUNITY\n\nBoth are considered candidates that would be top-liners if they were to land in Dallas.\n\nStill, Brian Schottenheimer stated he wanted to cast a wide net on his coordinator search.\n\nThe Cowboys have requested permission to speak with Browns safeties coach Ephraim Banda, Minnesota defensive pass game coordinator Daronte Jones, and the name that has been popping up a lot lately: Jim Leonhard, the Denver Broncos assistant head coach/pass game coordinator.\n\nThat is three requests, and we don't expect that to be the end of it.\n\nESPN's Todd Archer also reported that Dallas requested an interview with Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, but the Falcons denied the request. (We're told ownership wants to recommend that he be retained by the new head coach there.)\n\nIn previous seasons, the Cowboys would look at only a handful of candidates, rather than interviewing as many as possible.\n\nBut our own Mike Fisher has stated that having 10-15 coaching candidates come through and offer their thoughts on how your team can improve is invaluable. Even if you don't intend to hire them, pick their brains.\n\nWhy not get as much outside information on where your team can improve?\n\nLeonhard is the most accomplished of the three - and he's got a Schotty background.\n\nThe bad news on Daronte Jones? He's a Flores assistant ... which means you might not get Flores, who is seeking a head coaching job.\n\nThe bad news on Banda? Same thing as it relates to Schwartz.\n\nBut at least there is this: Cowboys Nation didn't want the franchise to sit on its hands in this coaching search and waste days while other top candidates get snapped up.\n\nAnd thankfully, Dallas is being proactive.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys wrapped up their 2025 season on Sunday and will now turn all of their attention to offseason work in the name of not finding themselves out of the playoffs this time next year. Obviously that is much easier said than done.\n\nThis upcoming offseason is one of the most important and critical in recent Cowboys history as they have multiple first-round draft picks for the first time since 2008. With the Cowboys now officially done for the season, we know where they will be picking come the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHere are the first 12 picks of the draft, through the Cowboys selection at number 12 overall, courtesy of Tankathon.\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar it is because it is… the Cowboys held the 12th overall pick last year and used it to select Tyler Booker. They also used it in 2021 to select Micah Parsons, more on him in a moment, although they picked it up after trading back two spots. For what it’s worth the Detroit Lions held the pick in consecutive seasons beginning the year after and landed Jameson Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs, so hopefully that type of success is what the Cowboys find.\n\nWhile we know where the Cowboys are picking, it is still unknown exactly where their other first-round pick will land. Dallas holds Green Bay’s selection in the 2026 NFL Draft and the Packers are currently set to visit the Chicago Bears in the Wild Card Round which means we are all rooting for Chicago to take care of business.\n\nKeep in mind that Dallas has also already dealt away 2026 draft capital as well.\n\n2nd: Dealt away in Quinnen Williams trade\n\n3rd: Dealt away in George Pickens trade\n\n6th: Dealt away in Jordan Phillips trade with New York Giants in early 2024, also received a 7th that was sent to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Logan Wilson\n\n7th (Kansas City’s): Acquired from the Chiefs when Dallas sent them Peyton Hendershot in early 2024\n\n7th (their own): Dealt away when Dallas traded for Kaiir Elam in early 2025\n\nThe Cowboys are projected to receive a couple of compensatory picks as well, potentially in the fifth-round, but those are not fully known at this time.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been playing out the string on a lost 2025-26 season, and they wrap things up on Sunday when they travel to face the New York Giants in Week 18. The Cowboys have nothing to play for other than pride, and they’ll be missing some key players in this game. Most notably on offense, they will be without running backs Javonte Williams and Malik Davis. That opens the door for Jaydon Blue to make his first start since the Cowboys drafted him in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nWilliams seemed fine heading into this week, but then was added to the Thursday practice participation report. He sat out Thursday with shoulder and neck issues. He was a DNP again on Friday before being ruled out on the final injury report. Davis showed up on the injury report on Wednesday with calf and eye issues. He was a DNP all three weeks before being ruled out. The Cowboys placed both players on injured reserve to officially end their seasons.\n\nIt is a good bet that Blue gets the bulk of Sunday’s workload. The team activated running back Phil Mafah, but look for him to serve as no more than a depth option.\n\nBlue has 22 carries for 65 yards and a five-yard reception this season. His biggest opportunity came in Week 7 and Week 8 when he had 15 of those carries for 58 yards. He had a fumble in Week 8, and that likely didn’t help him make his case for more work. Since then, he hasn’t touched the ball or even had an offensive snap. This week, he very well could match his season totals. He’s got talent, but at the very least he is an interesting volume play for Week 18 fantasy championships and DFS.",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Matt Eberflus decision awaits Dallas after final game",
    "description": "Your Sunday morning Cowboys news.",
    "fullText": "After a disappointing season defensively, the Cowboys could be making a move at defensive coordinator but nothing concrete as of yet.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are reportedly expected to make some changes to their defensive coaching staff at the end of the 2025 season. According to NFL.com’s Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero, it is “likely” some new coaches will be brought in on the defensive side of the ball, but “no decision has been made” yet on defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus. Rapoport and Pelissero noted that meetings about the Cowboys’ future will begin Monday, which could be when and where the organization makes a call on Eberflus’ status.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2025 season, the Cowboys traded superstar pass-rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers while in the midst of a contract stalemate. There were already concerns about Dallas’ defense after ranking 28th in total defense and 31st in scoring defense last season, and the issues were amplified without Parsons.\n\nThrough 17 weeks this season, the Cowboys have the No. 30 overall defense and No. 32 scoring defense, allowing 376.8 total yards and 29.8 points per game.\n\nThat is primarily why the Cowboys missed the playoffs with a 7-8-1 record despite ranking first in the NFL in total offense and fourth in scoring offense. Not surprisingly, the Cowboys lacked a consistent pass-rush this season following the departure of Parsons, as they are tied for 23rd in the NFL with 31 sacks and don’t have a single player with more than 5.5 sacks on the year.A strong argument can be made that Eberflus simply didn’t have the personnel needed to succeed this season, but since it is easier to make a coaching change than it is to completely overhaul a defensive unit, Eberflus could prove to be a one-and-done DC in Dallas.When the Cowboys hired Eberflus to coach under first-year head coach Brian Schottenheimer, Eberflus was coming off a three-year run as head coach of the Chicago Bears.\n\nThe Cowboys have placed their top two veteran running backs on injured reserve, leaving the door opening for Phil Mafah and Jaydon Blue to see significant playing time.\n\nFRISCO, Texas — The end of the 2025 season has arrived for the Dallas Cowboys, and earlier than they’d like, but they’ll at least try to avoid a second consecutive losing season when they travel to take on the New York.\n\nGiants in Week 18. Achieving that mission just got a bit tougher, though. Though they are expected to start four-time Pro Bowl quarterback Dak Prescott at MetLife Stadium, the same can’t be said for some other key players — sidelined due to injury. On Friday, the Cowboys ruled out Javonte Williams, Malik Davis, T.J. Bass, DeMarvion Overshown and rookie cornerback Shavon Revel.\n\nOne day later, they made a list of transactions that included moving several players to season-ending injured reserve, mostly academic, at this point, to clear the way for the activation of others from IR who have yet to touch the field this season. The decision to waive Trevon Diggs left one open seat on the 53-man roster but, given the laundry list of moves made on Saturday, that wasn’t enough. Three players were moved to IR and two activated, the additional seat being awarded to an undrafted, hard-hitting rookie and there was also an elevation to help with depth and special teams coverage.\n\nThe understandable decision to shut down both Williams and Davis not only opens the door for Mafah to try and build on his impressive preseason film, but also for fellow rookie running back Jaydon Blue to get another chance to show the Cowboys he is as advertised. Blue hasn’t been active in a game since late October, relegated to the inactives until head coach Brian Schottenheimer was satisfied with what he sees in practice, consistency-wise.\n\nOne of the top edge rushers in the draft says he would love to play for the Cowboys.\n\nOne of college football’s best is shining on the biggest stage. Miami’s Rueben Bain Jr. has recorded four sacks and 5.5 tackles for loss in the College Football Playoffs, and he’s making his pitch to Jerry Jones ahead of the 2026 NFL Draft. The Cowboys obviously need help putting pressure on opposing quarterbacks, and they can easily get that with Bain Jr., one of the most highly rated prospects in the upcoming draft. Cowboys fans will love what Bain Jr. had to say to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram following Miami’s win against Ohio State. The star edge rusher says he would love to play for the Cowboys if given the opportunity.\n\n“It’d be amazing. Any opportunity I can get, no matter where I’m playing, it’d be a blessing. I’ve already made myself familiar with the [stadium] grounds. It’d be an amazing opportunity.”\n\nMiami star edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr. says he would love to play for the Cowboys\n\nThe only thing that could stop Jones from drafting Bain Jr. would be if another team were to beat them to the punch. The Cowboys have also been linked to Texas Tech edge rusher David Bailey. Drafting him would be a win to fix their atrocious pass rush. The losses to the Lions and Vikings served as harsh reminders that if Dallas were to draft two pass rushers in the first round, it wouldn’t be too extreme at all.\n\nThe defense was barely able to touch Jared Goff and J.J. McCarthy, allowing both quarterbacks to look like prime Tom Brady. The departure of Trevon Diggs will have a lot of mock drafts predicting the Cowboys to take a cornerback with one of their two first-round picks. But a pass rusher should be the priority with their first pick, and Bain fits that bill. Bain Jr. is a big body at 6-foot-3, 275 pounds, and he possesses the power and speed off the edge that Dallas badly needs. He and Donovan Ezeiruaku could end up becoming a real problem for the NFL.\n\nBreaking down the Cowboys defensive plans versus the Giants.\n\nIn this episode of Between the Lines, we flip the attention to the defensive line, where chaos meets strategy. This is where the Cowboys’ games are won and lost so let’s dive in.\n\n(2025 Stats: 643 Total snaps, 40 Total Tackles, 6 TFL, 51 Pressures, 3 Sack)\n\n(2025 Stats: 392 Total snaps, 26 Total Tackles, 3 TFL, 12 Pressures, 0 Sacks, 1 PD)\n\n(2025 Stats: 697 Total snaps, 35 Total Tackles, 6 TFL, 44 Pressures, 3 Sacks)\n\n(2025 Stats: 89 Total snaps, 3 Total Tackle, 0 TFL, 1 Pressure, 0 Sacks)\n\n(2025 Stats [including Jets]: 596 Total snaps, 48 Total Tackles, 11 TFL, 51 Pressures, 2.5 Sacks, 3 FF, 1 INT)\n\nThe heart of this matchup is easy, Dallas needs the big guys in the middle to squeeze the pocket and clog running lanes, while the Giants will try to keep the ball on schedule and get it out fast. The Cowboys have been strong up front this year. As a defense, Dallas ranks eighth in pass-rush win rate (40%) and fourth in run-stop win rate (32%). Inside, Osa Odighizuwa and Kenny Clark both show up on the win rate individual leaderboards, with Odighizuwa ranking eighth in pass rush and run stop win rate among defensive tackles, with Clark not far behind him. But it’s Quinnen Williams who’s the sledgehammer here, and the Giants’ patched-up interior is exactly the kind of assignment that Williams can utilize his impact to create drive-ending plays. On the win-rate board, Williams is king in Dallas, ranking second among defensive tackles in Run Stop Win Rate at 46% with a 15% Pass Rush Win rate that ranks third, that’s top-shelf interior defense while consistently drawing extra help which helps the rest of the line. This is the core of Dallas’ plan to force long down-and-distance situations.\n\nThe Giants’ offensive line has been beat up. Left tackle Andrew Thomas and center John Michael Schmitz both hit injured reserve, so New York has turned to rookie Marcus Mbow at left tackle and veteran Austin Schlottmann at center. Before the injury, Thomas was a top-10 tackle in pass-block win rate, which shows the drop-off Dallas might be able to attack now that he’s sidelined. Communication inside between the guards and center becomes important, especially against stunts and late movement.\n\nEven with the injuries, New York’s blocking profile isn’t a pushover. As a team, the Giants sit 11th in pass-block win rate, but 18th in run-block win rate. That suggests the ball is coming out on time and that they lean on a quick passing game to help the line. Dallas has to answer by winning early in the snap so the quick game doesn’t have time.\n\nThe quarterback picture is simple. Rookie Jaxson Dart is running the huddle. His year-one line reads 2,042 passing yards, 13 touchdowns, five picks, and he’s added useful yards with his legs in spots including adding nine rushing touchdowns. The Giants’ run game is the other pillar. They rank sixth in rushing yards per game, with Tyrone Tracy Jr. at 637 yards and Devin Singletary adding 366 yards, both having to take the wheel with Cam Skattebo out for the year. That blend is exactly how New York tries to protect a banged-up front. Dallas’ interior has to knock them off schedule on first down so second-and-long turns into a difficult and obvious passing play.",

    "description": "The breakout season for the Cowboys' running back has led to some late-year injury concerns. Is he suiting up for the finale?",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys proved themselves right in 2025. For the last several years, they've reworked their philosophy about the run game, choosing to be penny wise in forming their backfield. After moving on from Ezekiel Elliott, they franchise-tagged Tony Pollard before letting him walk and replacing him with Rico Dowdle. Dowdle was then replaced this season by Javonte Williams, who was placed in a brand new offensive attack orchestrated by new head coach Brian Schottenheimer and new OC Klayton Adams.\n\nWilliams responded with the best RB season in Dallas since 2019, with over 1,200 yards on the ground, another 100-plus receiving and 13 total touchdowns. He has been able to last injury-free through much of the season, but alas he hasn't made it to the actual finish line.\n\nWilliams was knocked out of the Cowboys' Week 15 game with a shoulder/neck injury during the first half. He was replaced by Malik Davis for a while, but he was able to return to the game. He played in Week 16 and Week 17, but left the last contest midway through, again ceding his role to Davis. Now he's on the final injury report for 2025 with those same shoulder and neck ailments.\n\nIn fact, he's not just on the injury report, Williams has been ruled out of the contest, ending his season with the Cowboys. He is set to be a free agent in 2026.\n\nWilliams has toted the rock 252 times for 1,201 yards and 11 rushing touchdowns. he's also caught 35 of 51 passes for 137 yards and another two scores, giving him 13 on the season.\n\nMatchup: Dallas Cowboys vs New York Giants\n\nWeek 1 at Eagles: 15 CAR, 54 YDS, 2 TD, 2 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 2 vs. Giants: 18 CAR, 97 YDS, 1 TD, 6 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 3 vs Bears: 10 CAR, 76 YDS, 0 TD, 5 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 4 vs Packers: 20 CAR, 85 YDS, 1 TD, 3 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 5 vs Jets: 16 CAR, 135 YDS, 1 TD, 1 REC, 1 TD\n\nWeek 6 vs Panthers: 13 CAR, 29 YDS, 0 TD, 5 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 7 vs Commanders: 19 CAR, 116 YDS, 1 TD, 1 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 8 vs Broncos: 13 CAR, 41 YDS, 2 TD, 1 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 9 vs Cardinals: 15 CAR, 83 YDS, 0 TD, 1 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 11 vs Raiders: 22 CAR, 93 YDS, 0 TD, 1 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 12 vs Eagles: 20 CAR, 87 YDS, 0 TD, 2 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 13 vs Chiefs: 17 CAR, 59 YDS, 0 TD, 3 REC, 1 TD\n\nWeek 14 vs Lions: 17 CAR, 67 YDS, 1 TD, 2 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 15 vs Vikings: 15 CAR, 91 YDS, 1 TD, 0 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 16 vs Chargers: 9 CAR, 34 YDS, 0 TD, 2 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 17 vs Commanders: 13 CAR, 54 YDS, 1 TD, 0 REC, 0 TD\n\nFollow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Is Javonte Williams playing today?

    "fullText": "This offseason looms large for Dallas Cowboys receiver George Pickens as he chases his first big NFL payday.\n\nA Pro Bowler for the first time, Pickens has made it clear he would like to return in 2026. Dak Prescott, Jerry Jones, and Brian Schottenheimer are just a few who have made their feelings clear on having Pickens return, also.\n\nBut the small matter of a contract needs to be discussed first.\n\nAnd we know that isn't exactly a straightforward thing with Mr. Jones.\n\nCLICK HERE and WIN the DAK PRESCOTT BOBBLEHEAD By Joining Our COWBOYS COMMUNITY\n\nWith Jerry stating earlier this week he will talk to both George and his agent, David Mulugheta, the next couple of months will be interesting to see how the billionaire owner approaches it.\n\nBut is George prepared to talk to Jerry about the numbers of his expected deal?\n\nHe said he's “super-prepared\" for negotiations.\n\nBut he added, \"I definitely leave that type stuff to my agent just because I let them talk the deals and all that stuff, but definitely super-prepared.\"\n\nSo, Pickens has made it clear in a six-word summation - \"I let them talk the deals'' -- that Mr. Mulugheta will be handling the heavy lifting.\n\nThere will be no Micah Parsons one-on-one private controversy repeat, at least from George's side.\n\nWith the franchise tag looking like the easy decision for both the franchise and the player, it would net Pickens roughly $28 million in 2026 and give the Cowboys another year to fully evaluate No. 3.\n\nBut this season, George, aside from a dip in form for two weeks, has been sublime.\n\nPickens has totaled 1,420 receiving yards and nine touchdowns from 92 receptions. That includes five 100+yard games mixed in.\n\nSo, George has been exactly who Dallas had hoped he would be in 2025.\n\nNow the next step is to pay him. And to call the agent in order to do so.",

    "description": "The latest news surrounding the Dallas Cowboys is here.",
    "fullText": "This rocky situation finally came to an end.\n\nFRISCO, Texas – As the new year comes around, the Cowboys will enter 2026 without Trevon Diggs on their roster after waiving the sixth-year CB on Tuesday.\n\nIn his weekly Wednesday press conference, head coach Brian Schottenheimer explained the team’s decision to move on from the former All-Pro.\n\n“It was a culmination of multiple factors,” Schottenheimer said. “Performance, other elements. He’s been an incredible player for this organization, and I really do, I truly do like Trevon a lot, I wish him nothing but the best and I’m excited to see where he lands and watch him continue his career.”\n\nOne of those factors came to light after Diggs was waived on Tuesday, as reports surfaced that Diggs did not take the team’s flight back to Dallas from Washington after the Cowboys’ 30-23 win over the Commanders on Christmas, and instead elected to remain in Washington with his family.\n\n“It was one of many factors, it was not the only factor,” Schottenheimer said. “I’m not the Grinch that stole Christmas. I love Christmas, I love my family. But at the end of the day, we have a protocol that we go through and the process was not followed.”\n\nSchottenheimer explained that his protocol is unless there is “a family emergency or something specific,” the team travels together both to and from games. He added that Diggs did not tell him he would be staying behind until the team was in the locker room following the game.\n\n“First time I heard about it, Trevon grabbed me after the game,” Schottenheimer said. “I’m celebrating a big win, and I explained to him the protocol, which has always been the protocol, we go up as a team, we come back as a team. And he decided to make a decision. I’ll say this: It was not the only reason that this decision was made.”\n\nNot playing linebacker Logan Wilson in Week 17 could be the final nail for Matt Eberflus in Dallas.\n\nIt’s extremely difficult to lose a trade when all you give up to acquire a solid veteran linebacker is a seventh-round draft pick, but lo and behold, the Dallas Cowboys have managed to pull it off.\n\nThe linebacker in question, of course, is Logan Wilson, whom Dallas acquired from the Cincinnati Bengals just ahead of the trade deadline in early November. And here we are in late December, and the 29-year-old has already fallen out of favor with Dallas defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, so much so that he took exactly zero snaps in the Cowboys’ Christmas Day victory over the Washington Commanders.\n\nNow, has Wilson made a huge impact since coming over from the Bengals. No, he hasn’t. But he also hasn’t been given much of an opportunity, as he’s only taken more than 30 snaps once while wearing a Cowboys uniform, and that was in his first game with the team in Week 11 against the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nKenneth Murray Jr., meanwhile, whose 40.1 overall PFF grade ranks 82nd among 87 eligible linebackers, continues to get 40-plus snaps per game and literally took every single defensive snap against the Commanders.\n\nCowboys executive vice president and CEO Stephen Jones attempted to chalk Wilson’s lack of playing time up to “confusion,” but he clearly wasn’t thrilled with what transpired.\n\n“That was unfortunate with Logan,” Jones told 105.3 The Fan. “They didn’t have many snaps throughout the game, much less obviously in the first half. I will say it was, I wouldn’t call it a mistake, but some confusion in terms of how that rotation was supposed to go with [LBs coach Dave] Borgonzi. It certainly wasn’t the intent for him not to play a snap, but sometimes the game with not many snaps on one particular side of the ball, things can not go according to plan. I’m sure Schotty will address that as well.”\n\nThe hope train for Brian Flores is in full force.\n\nWith Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus being on the hot seat, a large portion of the fanbase has become obsessed with one man who could bring one of the most fun defensive schemes to town: Minnesota Vikings DC Brian Flores.\n\nFlores—who is on an expiring deal in Minnesota—is expected to be a hot asset this offseason and a head coaching candidate. And while a “lateral” move from a coordinator position to another is uncommon, Flores inadvertently fueled Cowboys Nation’s hopes during a press conference on Monday.\n\nFlores sounds very non-commital to the Vikings\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Flores addressed reports about his “talks” with the Vikings before the imminent end of his deal. The Vikings DC was very non-committal about his future in Minnesota, while acknowledging there’s a business side to his situation.\n\n“I said this many times, I’ve loved my time here in Minnesota,” Flores said. “My family loves it, the state of Minnesota has been tremendous to me, (HC Kevin O’Connell) mentioned there’s been great dialogue, and there has. Now we’ll just let the club and my representation handle the rest.”\n\nAsked if he wanted to “come back” to Minnesota, Flores again said he loves Minnesota but noted things have to line up.\n\n“If everything lines up and it fits—from a football standpoint, it fits,” Flores said. “I think there’s always a businness part of this. The football all lines up. We’ll just see where it all goes.”\n\nThat doesn’t sound just like a coach who is only seeking a head coaching opportunity but rather a coach who is open to anything, even being a defensive coordinator elsewhere.\n\nChanges certainly have to be made to fix a putrid Cowboys defense.\n\nThis season has seen the Dallas Cowboys field one of the worst defenses that they have ever had in franchise history. At some points they were able to stop the bleeding, but for the most part it has been an absolute disaster.\n\nDefensive coordinator Matt Eberflus has been the target of many for criticism and blame, and it stands to reason that he will be held accountable by team leadership when it comes time to assess what happened.\n\nJerry Jones appeared on 105.3 The Fan on Tuesday morning and noted that Eberflus is certainly responsible, although not all on his own, and that changes are to be expected “pronto” following the season’s end.\n\nJerry Jones makes it clear on @1053thefan that he views the defensive breakdown in 2025, “has been team wide.” Jones said, “It’s not all Eberflus at all.” He said decisions will be made, \"pronto,\" when it comes to whatever changes will be made.\n\n— Todd Archer (@toddarcher) December 30, 2025",

    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles are heading into the playoffs as they look to defend their Super Bowl title. However, the Eagles could add to their roster more ahead of the postseason.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys released former All-Pro cornerback Trevon Diggs on Tuesday. Diggs inked a five-year $97 million deal with the Cowboys in 2023, but they have cut ties after an underwhelming 2025 season.\n\nDiggs has a 158.3 passer rating when targeted, which is a perfect passer rating. That means teams are completing passes at a high rate when targeting Diggs.\n\nHowever, he has shown he can be one of the top cornerbacks in the league, leading the league in interceptions in 2021 with 11 and earning All-Pro honors.\n\nThe Eagles could use more depth in their secondary and have shown an interest in adding a talented cornerback coming off some struggles. At the trade deadline, Philadelphia acquired Jaire Alexander from the Baltimore Ravens, taking the chance on a former star cornerback.\n\nAlexander was never suited for the Eagles, as he decided to take time off from football, but that move shows that they could be aggressive in adding to the cornerback room.\n\nDiggs is a player who fits that mold and could potentially help Philadelphia's defense on their playoff run. Even if Diggs continues to struggle, they don't have to play him over their current cornerbacks, and it wouldn't be costly, as he comes on a cheap contract.\n\nIf the Eagles were able to turn around Diggs's career, it would hurt the rival Cowboys more, which is an added bonus.\n\nPhiladelphia is set to be the No.2 or No. 3 seed in the NFC depending on the results of the Week 18 games. They haven't been as consistent of a team as they were in 2024, but still have a talented roster that could get back to the Super Bowl.\n\nWhile Diggs may or may not get back to the level he was at in the 2021 season, he could be worth signing on a cheap contract to add depth to the cornerback room ahead of the Eagles' road to repeat as Super Bowl champions.",

    "fullText": "Cowboys listed as ideal landing spot for veteran running back in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter missing out on postseason play for a second consecutive season, the Dallas Cowboys will have some major questions to answer over the offseason, including what they plan to do at the running back position.\n\nThe Cowboys got some surprisingly productive play from Javonte Williams this season. The fifth-year back has started in all 16 games for Dallas on the current campaign and tallied 1,201 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. He also has 35 receptions for 137 yards and two more TDs.\n\nUnfortunately for Dallas, Williams is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and his productive play over the course of the campaign may have elevated him out of the Cowboys’ price range, which would leave them seeking a replacement.\n\nThat’s where veteran back J.K. Dobbins could come in. Like Williams, Dobbins is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and he could prove to be a realistic, affordable target for Dallas.\n\nFor those reasons, the Cowboys were recently listed as an ideal landing spot for Dobbins by Alex Kay of Bleacher Report.\n\n“With Dobbins missing multiple games in all six of his NFL seasons—including all of the 2021 campaign and almost all of 2023—it'll be tough for him to earn any sort of long-term deal from a club,” Kay wrote. “… Dobbins will be well worth rolling the dice on for a cash-strapped club like the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nMore Dallas Cowboys news: Dak Prescott explains why he wants to play in regular season finale for Cowboys\n\n\"The team could be priced out of retaining Javonte Williams and will want to make up that lost production by coming to terms on a cheap, incentive-laden deal with Dobbins.”\n\nWhen it comes to Dobbins, health has always been a consistent concern as he’s missed a chunk of time in each of the last four seasons. He started strong in Denver this season before eventually being placed on the IR with a foot injury. Prior to the injury though, Dobbins had a solid season for the Broncos, tallying 772 rushing yads and four touchdowns in 10 appearances.\n\nHe’s still just 27 years old, so he should still have plenty of gas left in the tank, as long as he can stay on the field. Given their other options, Dobbins could certainly be worth a flyer for the Cowboys, who could also look to add a running back in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft.",

    "description": "The heat continues to get turned up on Matt Eberflus as the Cowboys are now just one game away from their offseason protocol.",
    "fullText": "Dallas Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones loves to tell everyone he'd do whatever it takes to buy a championship. We all know that's not exactly true, however. Jones doesn't like firing head coaches before their contracts run out, as witnessed by them retaining Mike McCarthy for 2024 despite there being top candidates on the market like Sean Payton and Mike MacDonald, both currently in line for No. 1 seeds in their second seasons with their orgs.\n\nAfter McCarthy didn't work out, he went for the cheap option of Brian Schottenheimer instead of getting into bidding wars for the top candidates in 2025. Now Schottenheimer is fighting to achieve .500 while Ben Johnson, Liam Coen and Mike Vrabel round out the top-5 Coach of the Year candidates with Payton and MacDonald. In other words, the Cowboys could do more to get them a championship.\n\nJones' claims are about to be put to the test, yet again. Dallas is expected to move on from defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus. The org felt like Eberflus got away years ago, as the promising LB coach went to Indy to be DC before being head coach in Chicago. His reunion hasn't worked out as the Cowboys have fielded one of the worst defenses in recent history.\n\nThe scheme hasn't fit the players, and Eberflus hasn't been flexible enough to adjust. It's hard to envision a fourth new coordinator in four seasons, but that's better than giving him another season to ruin in opposition to a top offense.\n\nFortunately, there are a few options for defensive coordinators in 2026. There is however, one who is currently standing tall above the rest: Minnesota Vikings DC Brian Flores.\n\nFlores' resume is ridiculously impressive. Just this season, they rank 10th in fewest points allowed and fifth in fewest yards allowed (going into Week 17). The fact that he's done this playing opposite a wholly inept offense for the year says a lot. Bad offense means the opposition gets more possessions and scoring opportunities, plus favorable field position.\n\nDespite this, they've held six different opponents under 20 points in a game. They've done this to three of their last four opponents, with only the Cowboys crossing the threshold. They were so good against Detroit on Thursday, they won despite the Vikings' offense passing for just three yards.\n\nThe Vikings forced six turnovers in the win. For comparison's sake, Dallas has only kept an opponent under 20 points once this season. Watching Flores' defense game in and game out over the last month has proven to many onlookers what Minnesota fans have known; he's a mastermind.\n\nBut Flores is far more than what he's accomplished this season. Flores is a master of his craft. He improved the Vikings' DVOA from 24th in 2022 to 11th in his first year, and they soared to No. 2 in 2024. He earned his stripes under Bill Belichick in New England, serving as an assistant from 2008 through 2018, getting a head coaching opportunity in Miami in 2019. He went 5-11, then 10-6 and then bounced back from a 1-7 start to finish 9-8 in 2021.\n\nBut it was there that Flores ran afoul of the league's top brass. Dolphins' owner Stephen Ross tried to hire Payton illegally (docked a first and third-round pick) and then Flores ended up suing the Dolphins and the league. He provided claims that the Dolphins owner wanted him to tank games, offering cash payments, which he refused to do.\n\nFlores' success in Miami and his success as a DC since have not landed him on many of the league's insiders lists of potential hiring candidates this round. If he doesn't land a top gig, he's actually out of contract with the Vikings. They talked last offseason of extending him, but that never came to fruition.\n\nSo now, unless something is worked out over the next 10 days, Flores will enter this offseason as a coaching free agent. With the possibility he could be interviewed for a head coach opening, it would seem foolish to re-up with the Vikings for their coordinator gig, but technically not impossible.\n\nIf he doesn't, which should be the case, that opens the door for the Cowboys to offer him the moon to come in and save their defense. Joining high-profile Dallas, being the savior their defensive woes, would absolutely be the feather in Flores' cap.\n\nHere's a look at the rest of our top five DC candidates.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Wk 17 Eberflus Replacement Rankings: Flores top Cowboys DC candidate",

    "fullText": "Dak Prescott falls 1 game shy of Tony Romo’s record Cowboys streak after beating Commanders appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are not going to the playoffs this season, but they had enough gas in the tank to ruin Christmas Day for the Washington Commanders. The Cowboys pulled off a 30-23 road victory over their long-time rivals, and quarterback Dak Prescott threw for 307 yards and 2 touchdowns in the win.\n\nThe Cowboys jumped in front early and built a 21-3 lead midway through the second quarter before the Commanders did enough to make it a close game in the second half. However, the Commanders never threatened the lead.\n\nThe Cowboys (7-8-1) have a chance to finish the season at .500 if they can beat the New York Giants in the season finale, while the Commanders (4-12) will close against the NFC East champion Philadelphia Eagles. The Commanders made it all the way to the NFC title game a year ago, but this season has been a disaster for head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nWhile Prescott was able to impose his will on the Washington defense, he saw his streak of completing 60 percent or more of his passes come to an end at 15 games. Prescott completed 19 of 37 passes for 51.4 percent. If Prescott had been able to complete 60 percent of his passes against Washington, he would have passed Tony Romo for the longest streak in Cowboys history.\n\nWhile Prescott was able to make his share of big plays, the Dallas ground game came through with a couple of big performances. Second-year running back Malik Davis carried the ball 20 times for 103 yards. The Cowboys also received a complementary showing from Javonte Williams as he had 13 carries for 54 yards and a touchdown.\n\nKaVontae Turpin provided a huge highlight for the Cowboys when he used his speed to streak through the Washington secondary and catch an 86-yard TD pass from Prescott in the second quarter. The scoring play was the only reception of the game by the 4-year veteran from TCU.",

    "description": "Despite the loss, several players stood out for the Commanders in the Christmas Day loss to the Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders fell to 4-12 on the season, losing to the Dallas Cowboys 30-23 on Christmas Day in the home finale at Northwest Stadium.\n\nIt was an ugly start for the Commanders, allowing Dallas to score on all four of its first-half possessions. Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt did his part to keep the Commanders in the game, rushing for 105 yards on 11 carries and scoring two touchdowns, including a 72-yard run in the third quarter.\n\nWith Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota both out, veteran quarterback Josh Johnson made his first NFL start since 2021, completing 15 of 23 passes for 198 yards. Johnson played as well as can be expected, only putting the ball in harm's way one time. He did not turn the ball over. The problem for the Commanders was that they only ran 41 offensive plays, compared to 87 for the Cowboys.\n\nSo, which players shined in defeat for Washington? Who struggled? Let's look at the Week 17 edition of studs and duds.\n\nBill didn't have a lot of touches, again, Washington had only 41 offensive plays, but he made them count. Croskey-Merritt had a two-touchdown day, with his first touchdown run an impressive 10-yarder, in which he made some moves at the line of scrimmage. He could have had a third touchdown run, but lost his footing inside the 10-yard line. Croskey-Merritt now has 776 rushing yards and eight touchdowns, averaging 4.8 yards per carry. And he has done it with limited opportunities. That's not bad for a seventh-round pick.\n\nBILL TAKES IT 72 YARDS TO THE HOUSE\n\nDALvsWAS on @Netflix pic.twitter.com/5I9On67tbI\n\nIt's been an up-and-down year for the second-year cornerback. While Sainristil did break up a potential touchdown pass in the end zone, he gave up several catches and missed some key tackles.\n\nSainristil having a HORRIBLE game. Here is misses a tackle pic.twitter.com/CqjRl4uJX2\n\n— Mark Tyler (Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) December 25, 2025\n\nOn Washington's first drive, Deebo Samuel had a 41-yard catch-and-run where he trucked over Dallas safety Donovan Wilson. Samuel had another 27-yard reception, where he stiff-armed Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs to the ground. Samuel finished with 68 receiving yards and 25 rushing yards on only four touches. Samuel's performance against the Cowboys is exactly what Washington envisioned when trading for him last offseason. Samuel has had a good season, but has had to play more of a traditional receiver role for much of the year due to the Commanders' injuries at receiver. An impactful day for Deebo.\n\nOH MY, DEEBO.\n\nDALvsWAS on @Netflix pic.twitter.com/kUXeh1JJbJ\n\nRemember how linebacker Frankie Luvu was supposed to be even better in his second season for the Commanders? That feels like years ago. Luvu was so good in his first year in Washington that he was named second-team All-Pro. He was expected to have an even bigger year in 2025, especially rushing the passer. That never happened. Luvu's numbers across the board are down; he has only three sacks and missed tackles have been a recurring issue. In this game, Von Miller sacked Dak Prescott on a third-and-9, which would have forced the Cowboys to either punt or attempt a long field goal. Instead, Luvu was flagged, the Cowboys had an automatic first down and eventually kicked a field goal. That made it 27-17.\n\nIt was a career day for the second-year defensive tackle. With Daron Payne out, Newton took advantage of his opportunity, finishing with nine tackles, including two for loss, three sacks and five quarterback hits. Newton was an active presence all game and clearly Washington's most impactful pass rusher. This is the type of performance the Commanders have been waiting on from Newton and the hope is he can finish strong next week against the Eagles.\n\nNewton with his 2nd sack of the game pic.twitter.com/qdcl3Q1Rkn\n\n— Mark Tyler (Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) December 25, 2025\n\nFor as much as we have blasted Washington's pass defense, the Cowboys rushed for 211 yards, averaging 4.8 yards per carry. Dallas was picking up big yardage on simple draw plays. On one third-and-8, fullback Hunter Luepke took the handoff from Prescott and picked up the eight yards needed for the first down. It was one of a series of embarrassing plays from Washington's defense. The run defense was better in the second half, but that's a low bar. Overall, it was a pathetic effort.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Studs and duds from Christmas loss to Cowboys",

Any time you set history it is always interesting to point out.\n\nYou may have missed the “history” as it was not obvious to the naked eye, even if it was technically seen by it. The Cowboys’ history made on Christmas was by way of their uniform combination as they wore (from top to bottom) their white helmets, navy jerseys, and white pants. Basically this was their old school “color rush” uniform with the navy jersey as the middle portion.\n\nThis is a combination that Dallas had never worn as noted. We have seen them use the helmet and pants before or helmet and jersey even, but either the silver helmet or pants were a part of those particular ensembles when they were trotted out before.\n\nRecent history has seen the Cowboys wear their navy uniforms more often and even do so at home which was previously something they never ever did. Consider that they wore navy at home last week in their AT&T Stadium finale.\n\nWe will see what else they come up with in the future.",

    "description": "Week 17 will go down as a win for the Cowboys but there are other numbers that tell the real story of what happened against Washington.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys’ Week 17 win over the rival Washington Commanders won’t be remembered for much. Both teams entered the Christmas Day affair firmly eliminated from playoff contention and both teams showed exactly why they are categorized as pretenders rather than contenders.\n\nDespite claiming the 30-23 win, the day rang hollow for Dallas. Not since Clark W. Griswald was enrolled in the Jelly of the Month club has such a disappointing gift been bestowed. The Cowboys moved to 7-8-1 with a chance to avoid a losing season next week, but the game was against a third-string quarterback and took until the final minute to seal the deal. The win was big for the culture but wasn't, by any means, uplifting.\n\nUnlike most weeks, it wasn’t about the final score or the win-loss record. Those numbers pale in comparison to a few other telling numbers. At the end of the day it’s all about 87, 38, and 6. An explanation:\n\n87 offensive plays is a ridiculously high number of plays for an offense to post in an overtime game, let alone a game played entirely in regulation. Compared to the Commanders' 41 plays, it signaled total dominance on the afternoon. Combined with the 152-yard delta in offensive yards gained, it showed Dak Prescott and company were clearly in control. Considering there were zero Cowboys’ turnovers, it’s hard to believe Dallas only won by seven points.\n\nIf this proves anything it’s that it takes more than a dominant offense to safely win in today’s NFL. The Cowboys’ break-but-don’t bend defense (you read that correctly) has given up points in droves this season and far too often rewarded touchdowns on red zone appearances. No yards were wasted for Washington.\n\nThe Cowboys' 87 plays are the third-most in an NFL game this season, per TruMedia.\n\n— Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala) December 25, 2025\n\nTime of possession is one of the more overrated stats in the NFL, yet it does shed light on the current state of affairs in Dallas. In this case it speaks to the Cowboys' balance and efficiency on offense. It also exposes their second-half struggles where they only managed six total points which comes on the heels of a Week 16 game where Dallas scored zero points in the second half against the Chargers.\n\nIt's a one-score game with 16 seconds left in the third quarter. Cowboys, 27-20. Cowboys have not scored a second-half touchdown since the fourth quarter of the Detroit game. It's up to 14 possessions without a second half TD (2 vs. Lions, 5 vs Minn, 5 vs. Chargers, 2 vs. Wash)\n\n— Todd Archer (@toddarcher) December 25, 2025\n\nThe Cowboys' offense has proved their worth in efficiency but haven’t been opportunistic enough to turn all those yards into points. With so many plays and so much ball control, one would expect the Cowboys to strike gold more often than they did. Much like Buzz McCallister’s life savings, it was there for the taking, the Cowboys just couldn’t scale the bookshelf well enough to secure the lunchbox.\n\nDak Prescott was under constant assault in Week 17, falling six times for 38 yards to sacks. A case could be made three of the six sacks are on Prescott himself, but the situation highlights the pass protection limits this offense has had in 2025.\n\nThe need to fix the pass protection on the offensive line is real and has to be a priority this coming offseason.\n\nYou can follow Reid on X @ReidDHanson and be sure to follow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: By The Numbers: Cowboys win 30-23, but 87, 38 and 6 tell the story",

    "fullText": "George Pickens contract projection ahead of Cowboys WR hitting free agency in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne of the biggest decisions the Dallas Cowboys will have to make this coming offseason is what to do with wide receiver George Pickens.\n\nAcquired from the Pittsburgh Steelers during the offseason, Pickens has been everything Dallas could've hoped for, and then some.\n\nEntering Week 17, Pickens ranks third in the NFL in receiving yards and seventh in touchdowns through the air. Pickens has easily surpassed his career-best totals in those categories (1,342 receiving yards, nine touchdowns).\n\nPickens is slated to be a free agent in 2026, and he is not going to be cheap, whether the Cowboys extend him or utilize the franchise tag.\n\nFranchise tag projection: $28.04 million\n\nContract extension projection: Four years, $122.8 million\n\nThe Cowboys have several avenues they can go with Pickens.\n\nThe most unlikely is simply letting him walk in free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys can also utilize the franchise tag on Pickens, which would give Dallas more time to work out an extension if the team can't get something done with him before he hits the open market.\n\nThe franchise tag would also allow the Cowboys to trade Pickens instead of allowing him to leave for nothing in free agency.\n\nOf course, the Cowboys can let Pickens play out the entire 2026 campaign on the franchise tag, although that could lead to Pickens holding out until he gets a new deal or gets traded.\n\nLast but not least, the Cowboys could simply get an extension done before needing to take the franchise tag route, although doing so would lead to the Cowboys having a huge chunk of their salary cap wrapped up in two wideouts when considering CeeDee Lamb's monster deal.\n\nConsidering the Cowboys' need for funds to improve the rest of the roster and the unpredictable nature of Pickens, who has a history of behavioral issues, something we've seen in Dallas, the Cowboys should tag and trade the veteran wideout for draft capital while allocating the funds they would've used on him elsewhere.\n\nIs Amon-Ra St. Brown playing today?

    "fullText": "Who is Josh Johnson? Meet Commanders starting QB vs. Cowboys in Week 17 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Washington Commanders will kick off Week 17 in the NFL with a Christmas Day matchup versus the Dallas Cowboys at Nortwest Field.\n\nWashington's season is already over, as Dan Quinn's squad sits at 4-11 heading into Thursday's game against Dallas and has been eliminated from playoff contention for the last few weeks.\n\nAdditionally, the Commanders are deep into their quarterback depth. With Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota out with injuries, Washington is turning to Josh Johnson to command the offense. Let's get to know Johnson a bit more ahead of the Commanders' Week 17 contest.\n\nJohnson played college football at San Diego from 2004 to 2007, and entered the league in 2008 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nSince entering the NFL, Johnson has broken the record for most teams played with, at 14. The 39-year-old has had stints with the Buccaneers, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals, New York Jets, Indianapolis Colts, Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Ravens, New York Giants, Houston Texans, Oakland Raiders, Washington Commanders, Detroit Lions, and Denver Broncos. He has also spent time in the UFL and XFL.\n\nJohnson has started nine games in his career, posting a 1-8 record. His lone win came with Washington in 2018.\n\nThursday's matchup with Dallas will be Johnson's tenth career start. We'll see if the journeyman veteran can lead the Commanders to a Christmas victory and help the franchise gain some momentum heading into 2026.\n\nIs Amon-Ra St. Brown playing today?

    "title": "Cowboys news: Dallas moves Tyler Guyton to injured reserve",
    "description": "Here's the latest news surrounding the Dallas Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "Second-year left tackle Tyler Guyton is done for the 2025 season.\n\nThe Cowboys could get one of their Pro Bowlers back in the lineup on Christmas.\n\nDefensive tackle Quinnen Williams (neck) was one of four Cowboys listed as questionable on the team’s injury report for Thursday’s game against the Washington Commanders.\n\nGuard Tyler Booker (ankle), corner Caelen Carson (hamstring) and wide receiver Ryan Flournoy (knee) were also listed as questionable.\n\nFive Cowboys were ruled out for Thursday: Payton Turner (ribs), DeMarvion Overshown (concussion), Phil Mafah (shoulder), Josh Butler (knee) and Tyler Guyton (ankle), who was placed on injured reserve Thursday.\n\nThings are a little different this year under Brian Schottenheimer.\n\nAnother year, another lost season. The Dallas Cowboys have two games left to play and once again find themselves mathematically eliminated from the playoff picture. Despite undergoing major changes to the coaching staff over the previous offseason, the Cowboys are on the same trajectory as they were last year under Mike McCarthy.\n\nThe situation in Year 1 of Brian Schottenheimer has caused many to call for something along the lines of an “organic tank.” By replacing proven veterans with young up-and-comers the Cowboys can simultaneously learn more about their roster and increase their odds of losing in a somewhat respectable fashion.  Obviously, the motivation behind that would be to gain better draft position in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nIt was a similar plea heard around Cowboys Nation in McCarthy’s final season last year. The year was 2024 and McCarthy had just finished his fifth and final season under contract. After three consecutive 12-win seasons, 2024 marked a clear decrescendo for McCarthy’s tenure.\n\nWhile the plea and circumstances behind it are similar for this year, the situations are apples and oranges. The first season in any head coach’s term is about building a culture. Messages are important and have lasting consequences. Send the wrong message early and a coach may never be able to overcome. It’s why letting off the gas, even a little, is a dangerous proposition, even when there’s seemingly nothing to gain.\n\nWhat the Cowboys need to do to get their seventh win of the season.\n\nIn a year that’s been effective all across the board for the Cowboys offense, one area they’ve executed at a high level in is the short passing game, with attempts that are between the line of scrimmage and 10 yards down field.\n\nFor the year, the Cowboys have the third most passing yards in the short passing game (1,716) with 12 touchdowns and five interceptions to go alongside it.\n\nIn their first meeting with the Commanders earlier this season, Dak Prescott completed 15 of his 20 passing attempts within 10 yards for 81 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nDallas has multiple different ways that they can get to those types of plays. George Pickens’ quick slant routes were one of them. We’ve seen quick throws from Prescott to his tight ends on curls routes too. Or, Prescott can get into his groove in the play action game and hit someone on a crosser as well.\n\nUltimately, the Cowboys will have their choice for how they can use the short passing game to move downfield. The good news is, the Commanders have struggled recently to get pressure on the quarterback since their first meeting with Dallas, when they lost DE and former Cowboy Dorance Armstrong for the season to a knee injury. Since Armstrong’s injury, Washington has gone from a 40.7% pressure rate (third-highest in the NFL) to 25.9% (second-lowest).\n\nChance to try new things on defense\n\nWe saw a little bit of experimentation from the Cowboys in a few ways last week, most notably with defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus moving from the sideline to the coaches booth in order to try and gain a better perspective of the defense.\n\nAnother moment that stood out was a specific formation where the Cowboys had three down linemen, and Donovan Ezeiruaku lined up like a linebacker and rushed against the interior of the offensive line as opposed to the outside like he usually does. He was trying to spring open Kenny Clark on a stunt, but the Cowboys couldn’t get home.\n\nWhile that specific instance didn’t work, this week’s game and next week’s serve as an opportunity to continue to try different things and see if there’s anything that you can find success with that could carry over into next season.\n\nFor example, and I’m not saying this is the sole option that could be experimented with nor am I hinting it’ll happen, what about trying some more six-man blitzes? The Cowboys have sent six rushes 5.8% of the time this year, the tenth-lowest mark in the league. Could that be a way where they can finally turn pressure into sacks?\n\nBelieve it or not, the Cowboys have recorded the 15th highest pressure rate in the NFL this season at 34.7%. Pressure is well and good, but getting the quarterback to the ground and forcing them into bad decisions is what makes that number look better. The Cowboys have struggled to do the latter half of that equation, but could try some new things against Washington considering the quarterback situation they are in.\n\nMatt Eberflus has plenty of pressure on him in Week 17.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are intent on playing their starters on Christmas Day despite being eliminated from playoff contention, including quarterback Dak Prescott.\n\nThe Washington Commanders don’t really have a choice. Not only is starting QB Jayden Daniels done for the year, but now it won’t even be QB2 Marcus Mariota taking the field on Thursday.\n\nJosh Johnson to face Cowboys defense\n\nLong-time NFL journeyman Josh Johnson will start at quarterback for the Commanders, Washington head coach and former Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn announced on Wednesday.\n\nMariota is dealing with a hand injury and he entered the concussion protocol in the third quarter of the Commanders’ loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last weekend. Johnson recorded a 28.7 passer rating in his relief, completing five of nine pass attempts for 43 yards and an interception.\n\nJohnson is better known for having played for 14 NFL teams, the most in league history. The last time he recorded a start was in 2021 for the Baltimore Ravens, when he completed 70% of his passes for 304 yards, two touchdowns, and a pick in a 41-21 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nMatt Eberflus can’t afford a bad game\n\nTalk about a nothing to gain, everything to lose scenario for defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus.\n\nThe front office’s comments have already made it clear that Eberflus is on the hot seat. Prior to Week 16, Jones said the team’s final three-game stretch would be big criterion when deciding on the defensive coordinator’s fate. So far, it’s not going great after J.J. McCarthy put on a career performance against Dallas last weekend.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: I don’t see how a good game against Johnson would raise his stock. The guy is about to start his tenth career game since first arriving in the league in 2009. But a bad outing? It could drive Eberflus’ stock into the ground.\n\nCowboys owner and GM Jerry Jones recently pointed out how struggling quarterbacks have consistently outperformed expectations when facing the defense. It can’t happen on Thursday, right?",

However, they'll be the opening act for the NFL on Christmas.\n\nThe Cowboys' season was a tale of two sides of the ball. The Dallas offense was one of the more exciting units in the entire league. With Dak Prescott playing at an elite level, throwing the ball to both CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, it was thrilling to watch the Cowboys' offensive attack.\n\nHowever, their defense was one of the worst in the NFL. It got so bad that Jerry Jones brought in some defensive assets to help the struggling unit. While it seemed to improve the defense's overall state, it was not enough to save their season.\n\nAs for the Commanders, it was an unlucky season to say the least. Every week it felt like another key player on their team was injured.

    "fullText": "Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season will kick off with a Christmas triple-header today and the first matchup will feature the Dallas Cowboys visiting the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET on Netflix.\n\nThe Commanders are just counting down the days until the season ends and got overpowered in a 29-18 loss to the Eagles last Saturday. They at least got another productive outing out of running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. and it appears that he’ll be holding down the fort in the backfield for the rest of the way.\n\nBelow, we’ll go over Rodriguez’s outlook in fantasy football for Week 17.\n\nRodriguez continued to take command of the Commanders’ backfield in last Saturday’s loss to the Eagles, putting together a solid performance with 15 carries for 63 rushing yards and a fourth-quarter touchdown that made the score more respectable. He has continued to shoulder a bulk of the workload since their bye last month and Saturday’s loss was the first time where he was on the field for over 50% of the offensive snaps this season.\n\nStart. Whether it’s Marcus Mariota or Josh Johnson starting at quarterback for the Commanders today, I still expect Rodriguez to get a bulk of carries for the holiday showdown. With nothing to play for, he may end up being the primary offensive weapon and could get fed a ton of carries in this one. Start him.",

    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders will face the Dallas Cowboys at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, in one of three Christmas Day NFL games.\n\nThe Commanders will be without backup quarterback Marcus Mariota, leaving Josh Johnson to start with Jeff Driskel as the backup. Without Mariota, the Commanders' offense becomes one-dimensional and easy to defend.\n\nThis is a game for bragging rights at this point, as both teams have been eliminated from the playoffs. It's a divisional matchup, though, and both teams want the win. Anything can happen in a divisional game, and this one is no exception, which is why there are still players with value in fantasy football leagues.\n\nIf you've made it this far into the fantasy football season, congratulations. If you roster any of the players on either of these teams, here are some players to start and sit in Week 17.\n\nThe Commanders allow the 2nd-most fantasy points to quarterbacks in the entire league. Prescott is a solid quarterback with decent receivers, and he'll be facing a Commanders secondary that is missing some key pieces. Prescott is likely to feast against the Commanders on Christmas Day, making him a must-start in this game.\n\nTreylon Burks has seen an increased number of targets in recent weeks, but he's not reliable enough to have fantasy value against the Cowboys this week. If Marcus Mariota plays, he will target Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel. If Josh Johnson starts, he could target Burks, but they didn't have a lot of success last week. Don't expect much out of Burks in Week 17.\n\nWilliams is currently questionable with a neck injury, and with the playoffs out of reach for the Cowboys, he might not suit up, so keep an eye on that. He did practice in a limited capacity on Tuesday, and if he suits up on Thursday, he will face a Commanders defense that ranks 28th in the league and allows the 4th-most fantasy points to running backs. He is a must-start if he is healthy enough to play.\n\nDespite the Commanders' current reliance on the ground game, McNichols isn't a viable option at running back this week. Chris Rodriguez Jr. and Jacory Croskey-Merritt are the top two running backs for the Commanders, and while McNichols has dual ground and air abilities, he isn't getting the same touches as the other two backs, and he rarely finds the end zone.\n\nThe Cowboys actually allow more points to wide receivers than running backs, but they still allow the 6th-most points to running backs in the NFL. The only way the Commanders' wide receivers have any fantasy value is if Marcus Mariota plays. If he doesn't, the Commanders will rely heavily on the ground game. This means that Wild Bill and Chris Rodriguez Jr. will get plenty of touches. Croskey-Merritt has scored in each of the last two games and could have a big game if the Commanders are forced to keep the ball on the ground.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Week 17 fantasy start/sit vs. Dallas Cowboys",

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

Mariota injured his throwing hand and quad in last week's loss against the Eagles. Quinn said the swelling in Mariota's right hand, combined with the short week, made it difficult for Mariota to play against the Cowboys.\n\nEarlier this week, Washington placed rookie wide receiver Jaylin Lane and defensive tackle Eddie Goldman on injured reserve. Lane, who is the Commanders' punt returner, suffered an ankle injury last week.\n\nMore bad news for Washington: defensive tackle Daron Payne and left tackle Laremy Tunsil are out on Christmas Day. Payne and Goldman's absences leave the Commanders thin at defensive tackle. Washington claimed veteran Shy Tuttle off waivers this week. Brandon Coleman will step in for Tunsil at left tackle.

    "description": "Sunday had a ton of rough moments for the Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "New week, same result. Even with the Dallas Cowboys being eliminated from the postseason, the hope was that the team could find some positives in the last few weeks of the 2025 season. Unfortunately, that didn’t really happen on Sunday. The Cowboys suffered another crushing loss at home, and quarterback Dak Prescott watched the final few minutes from the sidelines.\n\nAside from pride, what else do the Cowboys have to play for? The Cowboys could win their next two games and at least claim that they didn’t have a losing season, should they end the year at 8-8-1. Regardless of them not competing for the postseason, losing stings. Here’s how the Los Angeles Chargers thunderstruck the Cowboys.\n\nWhere has the pressure gone? Last week, the Cowboys couldn’t lay a finger on Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy. This week, it was more of the same thing against a much more potent passer in Justin Herbert. Mind you, Los Angeles’ offense is battered, playing with several backups and a third-string right tackle in Bobby Hart, who was relatively awful last week.\n\nWhenever the Cowboys committed an extra defender on a blitz, Herbert escaped the pocket to find his receivers or green turf ahead of him. In one critical moment in the game, Kenneth Murray had a free rush at Herbert, but couldn’t bring him down, and Herbert scampered away for a 33-yard gain. Déjà vu once more, as for the second consecutive week, Dallas fails to sack the opposing quarterback. Five-man fronts, dropping seven in coverage, nothing has seemed to work over the last two games. With two games left in the season, and defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus coaching for his job, he has to fix a defense that can’t get to the quarterback.\n\nNot containing Quentin Johnston\n\nThe Chargers have a lot of ways to beat you. Jim Harbaugh loves to establish the run and control the line of scrimmage, but he also has a great quarterback with weapons that can create explosive plays, and Quentin Johnston efficiently detonated on the Cowboys’ secondary. From the Chargers’ opening drive, he proved he was going to be a problem for Dallas. On Los Angeles’ first touchdown, he made a great one-handed grab to get the Chargers going.\n\nHe followed that up with a 50-yard bomb over the Cowboys’ secondary, then had a significant third-down grab over Trevon Diggs that allowed the Chargers to play keep-away and continue to drain the clock. Johnston had four receptions on five targets for 104 yards. When targeted, Herbert had a perfect 158.3 quarterback rating when throwing in his direction. The Cowboys allowed Johnston to be a one-man show to anchor the Chargers’ passing attack, and it cost them dearly.\n\nAlthough the Cowboys’ front seven didn’t give the secondary many opportunities, the secondary was also very disappointing. Many players in the back half of the defense had some pretty rough outings, namely, Shavon Revel. He was defending in coverage on Johnston’s touchdown, and often Herbert would single him out to make a play on defense. He also missed a tackle in space that would have allowed the Cowboys to get a stop on third down when KeAndre Lambert-Smith broke free from him and picked up a first down to extend a drive for Los Angeles.\n\nThat particular series lasted 16 plays and almost took eight minutes off the clock, 11 more plays after Revel’s missed tackle. Later, with the Cowboys down by 10 and hoping to get the ball back trailing by no more than two scores, Reddy Steward has a chance to stop Omarion Hampton at the line of scrimmage to set up a 3rd-and-goal from the two-yard line. Instead, he didn’t wrap up Hampton, and Hampton trotted into the end zone to effectively end the game after handing Los Angeles a 17-point lead. Justin Herbert converted several third downs, and it was partly because the secondary couldn’t tackle in space.\n\nThis may go unnoticed, but the Cowboys had so many penalties that came at the worst possible time. You knew, given the way their defense had been performing, Dallas needed to score a touchdown whenever possible. Tyler Smith’s holding penalty on the Cowboys’ second possession wiped away a Ryan Flournoy touchdown, and Dallas had to settle for three points.  Los Angeles would then score a touchdown on their next two possessions and carry a four-point lead into the half and receiving the opening kickoff. Those four points were the difference between a tie game at the break.\n\nCeeDee Lamb also had a big-time penalty as the Cowboys were in a position to tie the game. After Prescott completed an 18-yard bullet to him, the Cowboys were at the Chargers’ 25-yard line. However, two plays later on 3rd-and-5, Lamb drew a false start penalty that pushed the Cowboys backward. This was a precursor to George Pickens being a yard short of the marker on a third-down completion, and then Leupke was stopped on fourth to turn the ball over back to the Chargers. With how the Cowboys were rolling at that point, 3rd-and-5 would have been a breeze for the offense.",

    "fullText": "Is there any way this season can simply end?\n\nNo, there is not. The Washington Commanders will need to find a way to get through the final two games and see if they can get some players back healthy.\n\nQuarterback Marcus Mariota is battling with an injured quad and hand. Head coach Dan Quinn told the media on Sunday that they may even need to sign a quarterback to help them finish the season.\n\n\"It was [a] cleat that got to his hand on the top,\" Quinn said. \"But I don't know yet. It's swollen. I'd say we're going to, you know, call it day-to-day right now, of where it's at both with the hand and with the quad. And so, let's see what tomorrow is, and the following day. Then I'd say by two days from now, we'll have a very good estimate of where he is.\"\n\nThough Quinn didn't rule out needing to sign another quarterback, he did go ahead and rule out playing Jayden Daniels, the team's starting quarterback, in either of the final two games (Dallas, at Philadelphia). \"We would not consider playing Jayden. So, the first two options are the ones you were leading into of [QB] Josh [Johnson] and [QB] Sam [Hartman]. Would we consider somebody else coming in if he's not able to? Yeah, all those are on the table. That's something that [General Manager] Adam [Peters] and I are discussing tonight, and we did today. But yeah, option A and B, as you had said, but not C.\"\n\nJohnson is simply way beyond his best years, and Hartman? Did you see him in the preseason games? Yet, the Commanders chose to keep Hartman instead of looking elsewhere all season.\n\nQuinn certainly doesn't want to go out and sign a quarterback, bring him to Ashburn, and have him learn to play, if needed, in these final two weeks. You talk about difficult. It's difficult enough to find anyone who can play any position, but you actually think you might consider it for the final two weeks of an NFL regular season? Remember, this is a short week for Washington, which plays the Dallas Cowboys on Christmas Day [Thursday].\n\n\"I think it'd be difficult at any spot, but I think we're looking, let's see where Marcus is, where are we looking for the next two games too. So, that was really kind of our thought behind the discussions of where we are. I would say difficult, not impossible, but definitely difficult. I think we just saw somebody do it last week or two weeks ago pretty quickly. Not on our team [laughs], but I did see it happening. I was pretty impressed by it.\"\n\nYes, this is an NFL season many a Commanders fan might simply wish they could wake up and find this season had all been a bad dream... a really bad dream.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Who will start at quarterback on Christmas Day?",

    "fullText": "Week 16 has already blessed us with some amazing games, between the NFC West clash on Thursday that saw the Seahawks win an OT thriller against the Rams, and Saturday night’s Bears vs. Packers NFC North battle. Oh, and the Eagles also beat the Commanders — which eliminated the Chargers’ opponent this week, the Dallas Cowboys, from playoff contention. And heading into Sunday, we could see some big shifts in the AFC playoff picture.\n\nThe Broncos entered the week with the possibility of clinching the top AFC seed on the table. They needed to beat the Jaguars, and they needed the Chargers to beat the Cowboys to make it happen. The Chargers pulled it off, but the Jaguars shocked the Broncos with a 34-20 win.\n\nBut the most important shift we could still see in Week 16 is the Chargers clinching a playoff spot. That will happen with a win over the Cowboys, a box the Chargers checked, plus either a Texans loss to the Raiders (didn’t happen, though the Raiders made it a game) or a Colts loss to the 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nHere’s where the Chargers stand after the late afternoon slate, and the win over the Cowboys.\n\nDenver Broncos 12-3 (clinched playoff berth)",

    "description": "Trevon Diggs has come clean about how his October concussion. He also acknowledges that he is uncertain if he'll stay on with the Cowboys in 2026.",
    "fullText": "After two months of rampant speculation and mysterious silence on the subject, Cowboys cornerback has finally given an explanation for how he got a concussion back in mid-October, an incident that kickstarted his latest string of eight missed games.\n\nHis version of events, however, may not do much to quiet the calls for Dallas to cut ties with him.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowler himself acknowledged that Sunday's loss may have been his final game at AT&T Stadium in a Cowboys uniform.\n\nIn the days leading up to the 2025 home finale versus the Chargers, NFL insider Jane Slater reported that Diggs had shared with her how he got the concussion. She classified his explanation then as \"far less nefarious than some of the rumors\" that had been circulating online.\n\nAfter Sunday's 34-17 loss to Los Angeles, Slater shared- with Diggs's permission- that Diggs says he took a hit to the head while trying to install a TV from his ceiling. The pole mount, he said, fell on his head.\n\n\"I was trying to be a handyman,\" he reportedly told her.\n\nPer Slater, Diggs \"didn't think it was a big deal and didn't need to be addressed but speculation on the internet went way too far.\"\n\nSome of you wanted to know how Trevon Diggs got concussed. It was never that crazy but the lack of answers made it sound like it was. With his permission he shared and here’s the video of it.\n\nHe says a tv he was trying to install from the ceiling with the pole mount fell on his… pic.twitter.com/3ooFFZFWDb\n\n— Jane Slater (@SlaterNFL) December 21, 2025\n\nDiggs reportedly came to the Cowboys facility on Oct. 16 exhibiting concussion symptoms. He was declared out for the team's Week 7 contest versus Washington. The team moved him to injured reserve after that game, but reported the cause as a knee issue. He sat out longer than the mandated three games and was only elevated to the active roster this past Saturday, the final day of his evaluation window.\n\nDiggs and the Cowboys were at odds for some time over why he wasn't back in the lineup sooner. Diggs had been claiming that he was fully healthy and ready to return; owner Jerry Jones disputed that, based on what he had exhibited in practice. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer alluded to consistency issues that had more to do with Diggs's all-around behavior.\n\nNow pressed into service for the final three games due in large part to DaRon Bland's move to injured reserve, Diggs is faced with the possibility of being irreparably on the outs with the team that gave him a $97 million contract just two years ago.\n\n\"Yeah, possibly,\" he told reporters after the loss Sunday. \"If this is my last [home] game with the Cowboys, it's tough.\"\n\nDiggs got the start on Sunday in place of Bland. And while he was in on six tackles on the day, he was also notably the closest defender on a 25-yard second-quarter touchdown throw to Ladd McConkey and was repeatedly targeted by Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns and finished with a spectacular passer rating of 132.8.\n\nDespite the rollercoaster of drama that has marked his difficult 2025 season, Diggs has said he wants to return to Dallas next year.\n\n\"After the season, I guess we'll figure it out.\"\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nYou may have felt that this was the case for some time already in a matter of fact sense, but it became official on Saturday night when the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Washington Commanders. Thanks to losses over the last two weeks to the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings the Cowboys left themselves with only one path into the postseason and that was as the hypothetical winner of the NFC East. That will not come to pass as the Eagles have now won it.\n\nMuch is always made about how the NFC East has not featured a back-to-back champion since 2003 and 2004 when the Eagles did it themselves. They have put that all to an end by doing it once more and on the subject of streaks the Cowboys now have one going themselves as far as playoff absences are concerned.\n\nDallas missed the playoffs last year, they were eliminated around the same time as it happened on December 22nd, which means they have missed the postseason for two years in a row for the first time since 2019 and 2020. Then, like now, the Cowboys were in the final year of one head coach (Jason Garrett) and the first of another (Mike McCarthy). It is almost like that is not necessarily a recipe for success.\n\nThere is a lot of introspection that is necessary from the Cowboys these days and their current playoff drought is representative of that. We talk often about how this team hasn’t been the same since they were bounced from the 2023 Wild Card Round and obviously the evidence here speaks for that as well.\n\nWe now know conclusively that there are only 3 games left on the season for the Cowboys. We also know that their drought for Super Bowl and/or NFC Championship Game appearances (the drought that Stephen Jones didn’t understand to exist) will officially grow to 30 years. It is not an approximation or a rounding up.",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Cowboys CB DaRon Bland could be headed to IR with foot injury",
    "description": "Check out today’s latest and greatest news surrounding America’s team!",
    "fullText": "The Cowboys have received devastating injury news on cornerback Daron Bland.\n\nFRISCO — Cowboys officials are trying to determine if starting cornerback DaRon Bland needs surgery on his left foot, a person with knowledge of his health told The Dallas Morning News.\n\nIt isn’t known how Bland suffered the injury, but he missed the second and third games of the season with a foot issue.\n\nBland underwent surgery on his left foot last season, which caused him to miss the first ten games. Bland returned and played in seven games.\n\nThis season, Bland played in 12 games, recording one interception and six pass breakups.\n\nMatt Eberflus will no longer be on the sideline during games.\n\nFRISCO, Texas – After a conversation with head coach Brian Schottenheimer, Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus is moving from the sideline to the coaching booth to call plays for Dallas’ defense.\n\nEberflus said on Thursday that it was not the first time he and Schottenheimer had discussed the possibility, but they now believe it’s best for the Cowboys heading into their final three games of the 2025 season.\n\n“I think that’s a really good thing,” Eberflus said. “[Schottenheimer] and I talked it through, and I’ve done it before. It’s really a chance for me to get good perspective, get good information, see the game develop in terms of information given to me on the sidelines… it’s been a while, but it’s going to be a good adjustment.”\n\nThe first time Eberflus was in the booth in the NFL was his first season, when he served as the Cleveland Browns’ linebackers coach from 2009-2010. In recent years as defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts and then head coach for the Chicago Bears, Eberflus has been on the field and has also served as the play caller.\n\nWith Eberflus calling plays upstairs, that means those on the sidelines need to be able to deliver adjustments, messages or whatever else Eberflus observes from upstairs. While there’ll be communication from Eberflus to all his position coaches, defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton will be the one tasked with messages for the defense as a whole.\n\nThe Cowboys injury list has been a long one for most of the season.\n\nOn Thursday, the Dallas Cowboys practiced again where it’s business as usual with a game against the Los Angeles Chargers coming up. Here’s where the Cowboys are regarding injuries.\n\nThe Cowboys’ secondary is banged up once again this week, as many of their defensive backs are on the injury report. DaRon Bland (foot) did not practice for a second consecutive day. Bland has been hampered by a foot injury sporadically this season, so far this week he’s not quite healthy. Aside from Bland, many of his secondary counterparts were limited on Thursday again. Caelen Carson (shoulder/hamstring), Trevon Diggs (knee), Josh Butler (knee), Shavon Revel (knee). In Diggs’ case, he believes that he feels well enough to play, but there are some obstacles he needs to clear with the team before returning to the field.\n\nThe George Pickens conversations over the last two weeks have gotten silly. He will (and should) be here for the foreseeable future.\n\nHow much, if anything, will Pickens’ disappearance the last couple of weeks when the season was on the line cost him in terms of the Cowboys’ willingness to make a long-term deal? — Michael S.\n\nNot much at all. They understand that a big part of it is the extra attention coming his way from opposing defenses. They also know how much more explosive the offense is with Pickens and CeeDee Lamb on the field together. If I had to predict today, Pickens will end up getting the franchise tag. He obviously won’t like that idea. I just have my doubts about Jerry Jones’ being able to get a deal done with David Mulugheta after how ugly things got with Micah Parsons. Jones could prove me wrong, but the tag is more likely at this point. Either way, I don’t see a scenario where Pickens is playing anywhere but Dallas next season.\n\nIt is (unfortunately) mock draft season for the Cowboys again.\n\n16. Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1), Keldric Faulk, edge, Auburn\n\nThis season, Faulk has taken a step back in production, but there is no denying he is an explosive pass rusher who would immediately improve the Cowboys’ attack on the edge.\n\n“Dallas has the NFL’s second-worst scoring defense, ranking fourth-worst in yards allowed. The Cowboys also have the league’s worst pass defense, but they have pieces at corner and have played much of the season without the injured Trevon Diggs,” Flick wrote. “So the pass rush that’s tied for ninth-worst with 29 sacks is a better place to start. The 6-foot-6, 285-pound Faulk, a team captain at Auburn, brings size, intelligence, and a tremendous athletic profile to the table.”\n\nLast season, Faulk totaled 45 tackles, 11 tackles for a loss, 7 sacks, and a forced fumble. This season, he totaled 29 tackles, five tackles for a loss, and two sacks.\n\nMost fans are probably tired of this being the team’s biggest accomplishment.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys retained their status as the world’s most valuable sports team, according to the list published by Forbes on Thursday that ​was dominated by National Football League clubs.\n\nThe NFL’s Cowboys, who unseated Spanish football club Real Madrid ‌for top spot on the list in 2016, ‌were valued at $13 billion, a 29% jump compared to last year, Forbes said.\n\nThe National Basketball Association’s Golden State Warriors ($11 billion), the NFL’s Los Angeles ⁠Rams($10.5 billion) and New York Giants ($10.1 billion), and the NBA’s ‌Los Angeles Lakers ($10 billion) rounded out the top five.\n\nForbes ​said 30 of the NFL’s 32 teams were on its top-50 list, which also included 12 NBA clubs and two each from Major League Baseball, Formula 1, LaLiga and the ‌Premier League.\n\nThe Cowboys have a big decision to make on Kenny Clark coming up this offseason.\n\nThis means the 2026 offseason will see “cap casualties,” as they will need extra money to operate in free agency, the trade market, and with upcoming extensions.\n\nSpecifically, there is one high-quality and new-to-Dallas player that may fall victim to the Cowboys’ financial constraints. Here, we’ll talk about him and the money it would save by releasing him in 2026.\n\nKenny Clark: In-And-Out Of Dallas Thanks To Salary Cap Issues\n\nSavings (via Over The Cap): $21.5 Million If Released\n\nCap Penalty/Dead Money (via Over The Cap): $0 If Released\n\nThat’s right, the man in question is the player Dallas received from Green Bay this summer in exchange for the All-Pro Parsons.\n\nKenny Clark, 30, joined the Cowboys, alongside two first-round picks, and has played well in a reformed interior defensive line that now includes both Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa. Due to the financial details above, the trio may last one season.",

    "fullText": "Dec. 15 (UPI) -- J.J. McCarthy threw for 250 yards and two scores to help the Minnesota Vikings put the Dallas Cowboys on the brink of playoff elimination.\n\nThe second-year quarterback completed 15 of 24 passes and also ran for a touchdown in the 34-26 triumph Sunday in Arlington, Texas.\n\nThe Cowboys outgained the Vikings 423-327 in total yards and held a five-minute edge in time of possession, but missed two field goals and failed to secure points on three of their five red-zone opportunities.\n\n\"I'm proud of our team,\" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters. \"It's the first time all year we've been able to stack a couple wins together. We knew it would be very, very difficult.\"\n\n: @SNFonNBC pic.twitter.com/pKkcz7rYi2— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) December 15, 2025\n\nO'Connell said the Vikings' goal was to get off to a fast start, but it was their foes who found the end zone first Sunday night at AT&T Stadium. Cowboys defensive tackle Quinnen Williams intercepted McCarthy's first pass of the night. Running back Javonte Williams found the end zone with a 1-yard run to end the resulting drive.\n\nThe Vikings tied the score when McCarthy connected with Jalen Nailor on a 20-yard touchdown pass about six minutes later. The Cowboys and Vikings exchanged blows for the remainder of the half, and the score was tied 17-17 at the break.\n\nPro Bowl kicker Brandon Aubrey made field goals on the Cowboys' first two drives of the second half for a 23-17 advantage. The Vikings responded with an eight-play, 73-yard scoring drive, which ended with a 1-yard run from fullback C.J. Ham.\n\nMcCarthy connected with Nailor for a second touchdown -- this one from 4 yards out -- about 5:48 into the fourth quarter for a 31-23 advantage and the Vikings never trailed again.\n\nVikings kicker Will Reichard made a 53-yard field goal with about a minute remaining. Aubrey, who missed 51- and 59-yard field goals earlier in the game, split the uprights from 41 yards out on the next drive to cut into the deficit. The Cowboys then failed to recover an onside kick, ending their hopes of a rally.\n\nPrescott completed 23 of 38 passes for 294 yards in the loss. Star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb caught six passes for 111 yards. Williams picked up 91 yards and a score on 15 carries. Fellow Cowboys running back Malik Hooker totaled 37 yards from scrimmage and a score on 10 touches.\n\nAubrey made 4 of 6 field goal attempts, with successful kicks from 37 and 26 yards, in addition to two 41-yard conversions.\n\nTight end T.J. Hockenson and wide receiver Jordan Addison totaled 66 receiving yards apiece for the Vikings. Jones totaled 65 yards from scrimmage on 15 touches in the Victory.\n\n: @SNFonNBC pic.twitter.com/q40LRbnKjO— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) December 15, 2025\n\nThe Cowboys (6-7-1), who were 3-5-1 through nine weeks, but rallied to reach playoff contention, can officially be eliminated Saturday if the Philadelphia Eagles (9-5) beat the Washington Commanders (4-10).\n\n\"We are professional football players,\" Prescott said. \"You've gotta come to work and give your absolute best, regardless. Unfortunately, I'm sure the playoffs are out of the picture. But it's about taking pride in who you are as a man and your job and everything that's gotten you to this point.\"\n\nPrescott and the Cowboys will host the Los Angeles Chargers (10-4) at 1 p.m. EST Sunday in Arlington, Texas.

    "description": "The Packers made a blockbuster trade for former Cowboys defensive superstar Micah Parsons with winning the Super Bowl most in mind. Do they have enough talent without him to make a deep playoff run? The answer is no.",
    "fullText": "Micah Parsons’ injury impact: Why Packers won't win Super Bowl 60 without star edge rusher originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are one of several strong Super Bowl contenders from the NFC, even after Sunday's tough inter-conference loss at Denver, dropping them to 9-4-1 and the No. 7 seed. But they suffered a much more significant loss in the game with edge rusher Micah Parsons going down with what is feared to be a torn ACL.\n\nThe likely devastating knee injury means the Packers, as either NFC North champions or a wild-card team, won't have Parsons for the playoffs. Not only did he produce 12.5 sacks in 14 games, he has been terrific with his consistent pressure on quarterbacks. He also was better than expected against the run with the arguable best season in his career.\n\nUnfortunately, the Packers also weren't immune to the injury bug that bit Parsons in his final of four seasons with the Cowboys in 2024, only they probably won't be getting him back. Here's a look at whether Green Bay's defense or team as a whole is still capable of making a winning run through Super Bowl 60 without him:\n\nMORE: Micah Parsons injury update\n\nThough 14 games, the Packers as a team have 33 sacks, recording none against Bo Nix and the Broncos in their 34-26 loss in Week 15. Without Parsons at right defensive end, the healthy leading pass rusher is fellow starting end Rashan Gary, with 8.5. Gary has had a disappointing season and much of his production stems from the blocking attention on Parsons.\n\nDefensive tackle Devonte Wyatt is third on the team with 4 sacks, but he's also out for the season with an ankle injury. Backup end Kingsley Engabare, who also has been ineffective as a situational passer rusher has only 2 sacks to land fourth. He and Lukas Van Ness (only 1.5 sacks) will be pressed into more action to support Gary.\n\nThe Packers putting no heat on the Broncos' offensive line even before Parsons got hurt isn't a good sign. Green Bay remains a solid run defense, but now it is a missing the most important piece in trying to close out opponents in the second half.\n\nGreen Bay hasn't been giving Parsons much real support in the pass rush, making it even more difficult to replace him this late in the season.\n\nMORE: Latest updates, recovery time on Micah Parsons after left knee injury\n\nThe NFC is a top-heavy conference. There are lot of explosive passing games, led by the Rams and Matthew Stafford. The Bears, Eagles, Buccaneers, Seahawks and 49ers, the rest of the playoff-positioned teams ahead of Packers, also would get a huge break in potential matchups.\n\nThe Packers' playoff track record with Matt LaFleur is already shaky. They have gone 3-5 under their head coach and haven't advanced to the NFC championship game in five years. Navigating this field of heavyweights will be tough, especially without any home games.\n\nThe good news is, finishing with the Bears, Ravens and Vikings give the Packers games they win without Parsons. Given Green Bay beat Chicago in Week 14, there's a fair chance it can rally to still take the NFC North and get as high as the No. 2 seed again.\n\nThe bad news is, it will still be tough to beat the now No. 2 Bears a second time and the team already has lost to the No. 3 Eagles. The Packers are trending to face either a tough team from the NFC West (Seahawks or 49ers) at home or getting a tough rematch on the road.\n\nWith the conference title race so tight, missing one key player can make the difference. Outside of quarterback Jordan Love, Parsons is the Packers' most indispensable player.\n\nGreen Bay's Super Bowl odds are now trending against them. No Parsons is that significant of a blow.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings may be eliminated from playoff contention, but you could not tell by the way this team played tonight. The Vikings went into Dallas and defeated the Cowboys 34-26. The offense looks like it is finally finding some semblance of cohesion, but it still has those growing pains. However, those pains are tolerable as this team has dropped 30+ points in back-to-back games.\n\nWith the game officially wrapped up, let's take a look at the winners and losers from today's performance.\n\nNine is heating up. J.J. McCarthy has put together two nice outings and looks to be figuring some things out. In this one, he went 15/24 for 250 yards and a 2/1 TD/INT ratio. The decision-making has improved dramatically since coming back from his concussion, and when the tempo and accuracy start coming together, McCarthy just might figure things out.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings came into tonight's game ranked 22nd in the NFL in rushing yards per game. In the first half, the Vikings allowed just 44 yards. However, in the second half, the floodgates opened, as this team finished with 138 rush yards. Javonte Williams ran for 91 yards and a touchdown, averaging 6.1 yards per carry. There are certainly some things to clean up, and the rush defense needs to be a priority to sharpen up.\n\nJalen Nailor had his first career two-touchdown game, as he finished with just three receptions for 47 yards, but those two touchdowns were huge for this offense. Nailor appears to have the trust of McCarthy in the redzone, which, with the struggling connection with Justin Jefferson, McCarthy needs to have someone outside he can depend on. Speaking of which...\n\nYes, we have a neutral selection, but it needs to be talked about. The statistical performance was not good, as Justin Jefferson finished with just two receptions again for 22 yards. However, it is the eight targets that almost makes him a winner in my eyes. Jefferson had a touchdown early called back by a penalty, and another in the second half that went through his hands. The connection has struggled, yes, but this should be viewed as a positive stepping stone as we head toward the end of the season.\n\nAs we discussed at the top, the Minnesota Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention before the team took the field, as the franchise needed the Cleveland Browns to beat the Chicago Bears. It was a rough start to the year, and it is tough to find positives in this season now that it is basically over. But these last two games should instill some optimism about this franchise and whether they can keep this going.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Vikings Wire: Winners and Losers from Vikings Week 15 win over the Cowboys",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch the NFL game tonight\n\nEntering the final quarter of the NFL season, it’s officially do-or-die for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSitting at a precarious 6-6-1 after a damaging Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions, the Cowboys are clinging to life in the NFC playoff picture. The road to the NFC East crown has become a steep uphill climb, with the division-leading Philadelphia Eagles holding a significant advantage at 8-5. For Dallas, the margin for error has evaporated; it can no longer afford the inconsistent performances that have defined its season.\n\nWith the NFC wild-card race stacked — featuring contenders like the Lions, Panthers and Buccaneers — the Cowboys need a near-perfect run to separate themselves. Their remaining schedule features three of four games against NFC opponents with playoff implications. The crucible begins immediately in Week 15 with a pivotal home Sunday Night Football clash against the Minnesota Vikings (5-8).\n\nWhile Minnesota will almost certainly miss the playoffs, it provides a tough matchup for Dallas. The Vikings' defense is coming off a game where it shut out the Commanders, forcing three turnovers and giving up just over 200 yards in a 31-0 win. Offensively, while J.J. McCarthy has had his struggles in his first year as a starter, the Vikings still have plenty of weapons to boats, including a top wide receiver duo in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison; with these two, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, the receiving talent is off the charts.\n\nDallas needs a home primetime win to keep its playoff aspirations alive, while Minnesota is looking to build on the momentum it generated last week.\n\nFollow along for all the action from AT&T Stadium.\n\nSTREAM: Watch Vikings vs. Cowboys LIVE with Peacock\n\nNFL HQ:Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\n\n10:42 p.m.: Williams is back with two big carries.

    "description": "Here is what happened in the third quarter of Sunday night’s Cowboys game.",
    "fullText": "The Cowboys received mixed news as the second half started. Javonte Williams was back (and did well on his first carry), but Hunter Luepke was ruled out with a concussion. It was noted that the injury occurred on the final kickoff to end the first half.\n\nLuke Schoonmaker (really) had an amazing catch that put the Cowboys at the Minnesota 11-yard line. A play later it appeared that CeeDee Lamb was interfered with in the end zone, but nothing was called.\n\nUnfortunately the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal which felt like a failure. Still, points are points.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 20, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 26-yard field goal)\n\nThis will sound shocking, but it is true. The Dallas Cowboys defense pitched a three and out on their next drive. It was a Christmas miracle.\n\nDallas tried to get KaVontae Turpin involved on offense on the next possession, a curious move given that George Pickens had not really had many moments at this point in the game. But hey, whatever.\n\nThings stalled out yet again and Brandon Aubrey delivered once more.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 41-yard field goal)\n\nRight off the bat the Vikings were across midfield. Playing with your food has consequences.\n\nNot long after that the Vikings were up against the goal line. Keep in mind before you reed the next sentence that the previous Cowboys four possessions ended with a field goal kick (they missed one obviously).\n\nBoom. Vikings touchdown. The lead changed hands.\n\nC.J. Ham is in for the go-ahead touchdown\n\nMINvsDAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/Mr3FNwwnmg\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 24 (C.J. Ham touchdown)\n\nTwo plays into the second quarter… the Cowboys had a touchdown once more. This one was courtesy of Malik Davis who was (obviously) in for Javonte Williams.\n\nMALIK DAVIS TD! pic.twitter.com/C3fbKMycuX\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 7 (Malik Davis touchdown)\n\nThe Vikings made sure to show up for the next drive, though. They moved thoroughly down the field and kept getting in their own way to keep themselves from scoring a touchdown. They wound up with a short situation right on the goal line and then J.J. McCarthy pulled the Peyton Manning bootleg.\n\nEmbarrassing pic.twitter.com/AJugDLlRaS\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 14 (J.J. McCarthy touchdown)\n\nThe game was tied at this point which felt weird because it had for so long felt like Dallas was in control. The Cowboys nevertheless began moving once more and ultimately stalled out in field goal range. Brandon Aubrey, though.\n\nUnfortunately Aubrey pushed his 51-yard attempt wide to the right which kept things tied and gave the Vikings solid field position to work with.\n\nMinnesota was able to scrap out a field goal which gave them their first lead of the night. It set Dallas up with a chance to score and 1:48 to do so. Given that Dallas deferred to start the game the drive also offered a potential double-dip opportunity.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 17 (Will Reichard 29-yard field goal)\n\nThe Cowboys were able to work quickly to get in field goal range themselves. Given Aubrey’s recent miss there was a little bit of breath holding for the first time in a while with him.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 17, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 17-yard field goal)\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys won the toss and deferred which put the defense on the field first. Given that there were reports about how Logan Wilson was set to start at linebacker… it was exciting to say the least.\n\nIt took two plays for things to get legitimately exciting. Donovan Wilson got pressure in J.J. McCarthy’s face and wisely put his hand up to block a pass. That errant ball landed in the expectant arms of Quinnen Williams to give the Cowboys a turnover and more importantly… the ball!\n\nQUINNEN WILLIAMS INT! pic.twitter.com/ImWT83EQCu\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAfter a couple of plays the Cowboys appeared to stall out and had to settle for a Brandon Aubrey field goal. They didn’t, though! They ran a fake! And got it!\n\nBRANDON AUBREY WITH THE WHEELS pic.twitter.com/GGGBuE5B1i\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAmazingly the Cowboys got down to another fourth down and went for it yet again, although this time conventionally by way of a Javonte Williams run.\n\nAfter getting it Javonte was in the end zone one play later.\n\nJAVONTE TD! pic.twitter.com/3ObBLpnpmW\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 0 (Javonte Williams touchdown)\n\nThe Cowboys defense went to work and while they were not able to generate a turnover they did force a punt. Dante Fowler was a particular point of pride on the possession in question and helped stop Aaron Jones.\n\nUnfortunately KaVontae Turpin let a punt go that he maybe should have fielded. The bounce really worked against Dallas and put them just about on their own goal line.\n\nMalik Davis was in at running back for the possession as it was reported that Javonte Williams was dealing with a shoulder injury. Ultimately the Cowboys wound up punting after a three and out as they did not want to get too cute.\n\nIt took two plays once more for Minnesota to have a moment. On the first one of them Aaron Jones had a massive gain and a penalty added to it to make matters worse. A few seconds later J.J. McCarthy hit Jalen Nailor for a game-tying touchdown.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 7 (J.J. McCathy to Jalen Nailor touchdown)\n\nWhen the Cowboys took over it was noted by the NBC broadcast that Javonte Williams was questionable to return with a shoulder injury so that corroborated everything to date.\n\nDak Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb for a huge gain and the Cowboys were in striking distance as the opening quarter came to a close. To help matters a facemask penalty really put Dallas close to another score.",
