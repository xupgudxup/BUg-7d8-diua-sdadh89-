    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

Head coach Dan Quinn announced that Mariota would miss Thursday's game and veteran Josh Johnson would start in his place.\n\nRecently re-signed Jeff Driskel will serve as Johnson's backup, while the Commanders are signing Sam Hartman to the 53-man roster as the team's emergency No. 3 quarterback.\n\nThe Commanders shut down Daniels for the remainder of the season last week after he'd reinjured his non-throwing elbow in a Week 14 loss at Minnesota. Mariota injured his throwing hand and quad in last week's loss against the Eagles. Quinn said the swelling in Mariota's right hand, combined with the short week, made it difficult for Mariota to play against the Cowboys.\n\nEarlier this week, Washington placed rookie wide receiver Jaylin Lane and defensive tackle Eddie Goldman on injured reserve. Lane, who is the Commanders' punt returner, suffered an ankle injury last week.\n\nMore bad news for Washington: defensive tackle Daron Payne and left tackle Laremy Tunsil are out on Christmas Day. Payne and Goldman's absences leave the Commanders thin at defensive tackle. Washington claimed veteran Shy Tuttle off waivers this week. Brandon Coleman will step in for Tunsil at left tackle. Linebacker Nick Bellore, Washington's special teams ace, is also out.\n\nThe 4-11 Commanders host the Cowboys for Thursday's Christmas Day game, which kicks off at 1:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Tunsil, Mariota, Payne all out vs. Cowboys",

    "description": "Sunday had a ton of rough moments for the Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "New week, same result. Even with the Dallas Cowboys being eliminated from the postseason, the hope was that the team could find some positives in the last few weeks of the 2025 season. Unfortunately, that didn’t really happen on Sunday. The Cowboys suffered another crushing loss at home, and quarterback Dak Prescott watched the final few minutes from the sidelines.\n\nAside from pride, what else do the Cowboys have to play for? The Cowboys could win their next two games and at least claim that they didn’t have a losing season, should they end the year at 8-8-1. Regardless of them not competing for the postseason, losing stings. Here’s how the Los Angeles Chargers thunderstruck the Cowboys.\n\nWhere has the pressure gone? Last week, the Cowboys couldn’t lay a finger on Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy. This week, it was more of the same thing against a much more potent passer in Justin Herbert. Mind you, Los Angeles’ offense is battered, playing with several backups and a third-string right tackle in Bobby Hart, who was relatively awful last week.\n\nWhenever the Cowboys committed an extra defender on a blitz, Herbert escaped the pocket to find his receivers or green turf ahead of him. In one critical moment in the game, Kenneth Murray had a free rush at Herbert, but couldn’t bring him down, and Herbert scampered away for a 33-yard gain. Déjà vu once more, as for the second consecutive week, Dallas fails to sack the opposing quarterback. Five-man fronts, dropping seven in coverage, nothing has seemed to work over the last two games. With two games left in the season, and defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus coaching for his job, he has to fix a defense that can’t get to the quarterback.\n\nNot containing Quentin Johnston\n\nThe Chargers have a lot of ways to beat you. Jim Harbaugh loves to establish the run and control the line of scrimmage, but he also has a great quarterback with weapons that can create explosive plays, and Quentin Johnston efficiently detonated on the Cowboys’ secondary. From the Chargers’ opening drive, he proved he was going to be a problem for Dallas. On Los Angeles’ first touchdown, he made a great one-handed grab to get the Chargers going.\n\nHe followed that up with a 50-yard bomb over the Cowboys’ secondary, then had a significant third-down grab over Trevon Diggs that allowed the Chargers to play keep-away and continue to drain the clock. Johnston had four receptions on five targets for 104 yards. When targeted, Herbert had a perfect 158.3 quarterback rating when throwing in his direction. The Cowboys allowed Johnston to be a one-man show to anchor the Chargers’ passing attack, and it cost them dearly.\n\nAlthough the Cowboys’ front seven didn’t give the secondary many opportunities, the secondary was also very disappointing. Many players in the back half of the defense had some pretty rough outings, namely, Shavon Revel. He was defending in coverage on Johnston’s touchdown, and often Herbert would single him out to make a play on defense. He also missed a tackle in space that would have allowed the Cowboys to get a stop on third down when KeAndre Lambert-Smith broke free from him and picked up a first down to extend a drive for Los Angeles.\n\nThat particular series lasted 16 plays and almost took eight minutes off the clock, 11 more plays after Revel’s missed tackle. Later, with the Cowboys down by 10 and hoping to get the ball back trailing by no more than two scores, Reddy Steward has a chance to stop Omarion Hampton at the line of scrimmage to set up a 3rd-and-goal from the two-yard line. Instead, he didn’t wrap up Hampton, and Hampton trotted into the end zone to effectively end the game after handing Los Angeles a 17-point lead. Justin Herbert converted several third downs, and it was partly because the secondary couldn’t tackle in space.\n\nThis may go unnoticed, but the Cowboys had so many penalties that came at the worst possible time. You knew, given the way their defense had been performing, Dallas needed to score a touchdown whenever possible. Tyler Smith’s holding penalty on the Cowboys’ second possession wiped away a Ryan Flournoy touchdown, and Dallas had to settle for three points.  Los Angeles would then score a touchdown on their next two possessions and carry a four-point lead into the half and receiving the opening kickoff. Those four points were the difference between a tie game at the break.\n\nCeeDee Lamb also had a big-time penalty as the Cowboys were in a position to tie the game. After Prescott completed an 18-yard bullet to him, the Cowboys were at the Chargers’ 25-yard line. However, two plays later on 3rd-and-5, Lamb drew a false start penalty that pushed the Cowboys backward. This was a precursor to George Pickens being a yard short of the marker on a third-down completion, and then Leupke was stopped on fourth to turn the ball over back to the Chargers. With how the Cowboys were rolling at that point, 3rd-and-5 would have been a breeze for the offense.",

The two teams sitting atop last week's rankings both lost, with the Denver Broncos losing by 14 points at home after standing alone as the best record.\n\nThings are shaping up for an incredible playoff season and with two weeks remaining, seeds are more up for grabs than ever.

    "fullText": "Is there any way this season can simply end?\n\nNo, there is not. The Washington Commanders will need to find a way to get through the final two games and see if they can get some players back healthy.\n\nQuarterback Marcus Mariota is battling with an injured quad and hand. Head coach Dan Quinn told the media on Sunday that they may even need to sign a quarterback to help them finish the season.\n\n\"It was [a] cleat that got to his hand on the top,\" Quinn said. \"But I don't know yet. It's swollen. I'd say we're going to, you know, call it day-to-day right now, of where it's at both with the hand and with the quad. And so, let's see what tomorrow is, and the following day. Then I'd say by two days from now, we'll have a very good estimate of where he is.\"\n\nThough Quinn didn't rule out needing to sign another quarterback, he did go ahead and rule out playing Jayden Daniels, the team's starting quarterback, in either of the final two games (Dallas, at Philadelphia). \"We would not consider playing Jayden. So, the first two options are the ones you were leading into of [QB] Josh [Johnson] and [QB] Sam [Hartman]. Would we consider somebody else coming in if he's not able to? Yeah, all those are on the table. That's something that [General Manager] Adam [Peters] and I are discussing tonight, and we did today. But yeah, option A and B, as you had said, but not C.\"\n\nJohnson is simply way beyond his best years, and Hartman? Did you see him in the preseason games? Yet, the Commanders chose to keep Hartman instead of looking elsewhere all season.\n\nQuinn certainly doesn't want to go out and sign a quarterback, bring him to Ashburn, and have him learn to play, if needed, in these final two weeks. You talk about difficult. It's difficult enough to find anyone who can play any position, but you actually think you might consider it for the final two weeks of an NFL regular season? Remember, this is a short week for Washington, which plays the Dallas Cowboys on Christmas Day [Thursday].\n\n\"I think it'd be difficult at any spot, but I think we're looking, let's see where Marcus is, where are we looking for the next two games too. So, that was really kind of our thought behind the discussions of where we are. I would say difficult, not impossible, but definitely difficult. I think we just saw somebody do it last week or two weeks ago pretty quickly. Not on our team [laughs], but I did see it happening. I was pretty impressed by it.\"\n\nYes, this is an NFL season many a Commanders fan might simply wish they could wake up and find this season had all been a bad dream... a really bad dream.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Who will start at quarterback on Christmas Day?",

Oh, and the Eagles also beat the Commanders — which eliminated the Chargers’ opponent this week, the Dallas Cowboys, from playoff contention. And heading into Sunday, we could see some big shifts in the AFC playoff picture.\n\nThe Broncos entered the week with the possibility of clinching the top AFC seed on the table. They needed to beat the Jaguars, and they needed the Chargers to beat the Cowboys to make it happen. The Chargers pulled it off, but the Jaguars shocked the Broncos with a 34-20 win.\n\nBut the most important shift we could still see in Week 16 is the Chargers clinching a playoff spot. That will happen with a win over the Cowboys, a box the Chargers checked, plus either a Texans loss to the Raiders (didn’t happen, though the Raiders made it a game) or a Colts loss to the 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nHere’s where the Chargers stand after the late afternoon slate, and the win over the Cowboys.\n\nDenver Broncos 12-3 (clinched playoff berth)",

    "description": "Trevon Diggs has come clean about how his October concussion. He also acknowledges that he is uncertain if he'll stay on with the Cowboys in 2026.",
    "fullText": "After two months of rampant speculation and mysterious silence on the subject, Cowboys cornerback has finally given an explanation for how he got a concussion back in mid-October, an incident that kickstarted his latest string of eight missed games.\n\nHis version of events, however, may not do much to quiet the calls for Dallas to cut ties with him.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowler himself acknowledged that Sunday's loss may have been his final game at AT&T Stadium in a Cowboys uniform.\n\nIn the days leading up to the 2025 home finale versus the Chargers, NFL insider Jane Slater reported that Diggs had shared with her how he got the concussion. She classified his explanation then as \"far less nefarious than some of the rumors\" that had been circulating online.\n\nAfter Sunday's 34-17 loss to Los Angeles, Slater shared- with Diggs's permission- that Diggs says he took a hit to the head while trying to install a TV from his ceiling. The pole mount, he said, fell on his head.\n\n\"I was trying to be a handyman,\" he reportedly told her.\n\nPer Slater, Diggs \"didn't think it was a big deal and didn't need to be addressed but speculation on the internet went way too far.\"\n\nSome of you wanted to know how Trevon Diggs got concussed. It was never that crazy but the lack of answers made it sound like it was. With his permission he shared and here’s the video of it.\n\nHe says a tv he was trying to install from the ceiling with the pole mount fell on his… pic.twitter.com/3ooFFZFWDb\n\n— Jane Slater (@SlaterNFL) December 21, 2025\n\nDiggs reportedly came to the Cowboys facility on Oct. 16 exhibiting concussion symptoms. He was declared out for the team's Week 7 contest versus Washington. The team moved him to injured reserve after that game, but reported the cause as a knee issue. He sat out longer than the mandated three games and was only elevated to the active roster this past Saturday, the final day of his evaluation window.\n\nDiggs and the Cowboys were at odds for some time over why he wasn't back in the lineup sooner. Diggs had been claiming that he was fully healthy and ready to return; owner Jerry Jones disputed that, based on what he had exhibited in practice. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer alluded to consistency issues that had more to do with Diggs's all-around behavior.\n\nNow pressed into service for the final three games due in large part to DaRon Bland's move to injured reserve, Diggs is faced with the possibility of being irreparably on the outs with the team that gave him a $97 million contract just two years ago.\n\n\"Yeah, possibly,\" he told reporters after the loss Sunday. \"If this is my last [home] game with the Cowboys, it's tough.\"\n\nDiggs got the start on Sunday in place of Bland. And while he was in on six tackles on the day, he was also notably the closest defender on a 25-yard second-quarter touchdown throw to Ladd McConkey and was repeatedly targeted by Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns and finished with a spectacular passer rating of 132.8.\n\nDespite the rollercoaster of drama that has marked his difficult 2025 season, Diggs has said he wants to return to Dallas next year.\n\n\"After the season, I guess we'll figure it out.\"\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

    "description": "The Dallas Cowboys have officially been eliminated from playoff contention.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nYou may have felt that this was the case for some time already in a matter of fact sense, but it became official on Saturday night when the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Washington Commanders. Thanks to losses over the last two weeks to the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings the Cowboys left themselves with only one path into the postseason and that was as the hypothetical winner of the NFC East. That will not come to pass as the Eagles have now won it.\n\nMuch is always made about how the NFC East has not featured a back-to-back champion since 2003 and 2004 when the Eagles did it themselves. They have put that all to an end by doing it once more and on the subject of streaks the Cowboys now have one going themselves as far as playoff absences are concerned.\n\nDallas missed the playoffs last year, they were eliminated around the same time as it happened on December 22nd, which means they have missed the postseason for two years in a row for the first time since 2019 and 2020. Then, like now, the Cowboys were in the final year of one head coach (Jason Garrett) and the first of another (Mike McCarthy). It is almost like that is not necessarily a recipe for success.\n\nThere is a lot of introspection that is necessary from the Cowboys these days and their current playoff drought is representative of that. We talk often about how this team hasn’t been the same since they were bounced from the 2023 Wild Card Round and obviously the evidence here speaks for that as well.\n\nWe now know conclusively that there are only 3 games left on the season for the Cowboys. We also know that their drought for Super Bowl and/or NFC Championship Game appearances (the drought that Stephen Jones didn’t understand to exist) will officially grow to 30 years. It is not an approximation or a rounding up.",

They will now look to finish the season on a high note, starting with Los Angeles and ending with the two road matchups versus the Commanders and the New York Giants.\n\nA lot of questions will need to be answered this offseason in Dallas, as the franchise has won just two playoff games since 2016, the beginning of the Dak Prescott era, and is still in danger of posting a third losing season in six years.\n\nJosh Jacobs, Christian Watson playing statuses revealed as Packers release inactives\n\nIs D'Andre Swift playing tonight?

    "title": "Cowboys news: Cowboys CB DaRon Bland could be headed to IR with foot injury",
    "description": "Check out today’s latest and greatest news surrounding America’s team!",
    "fullText": "The Cowboys have received devastating injury news on cornerback Daron Bland.\n\nFRISCO — Cowboys officials are trying to determine if starting cornerback DaRon Bland needs surgery on his left foot, a person with knowledge of his health told The Dallas Morning News.\n\nIt isn’t known how Bland suffered the injury, but he missed the second and third games of the season with a foot issue.\n\nBland underwent surgery on his left foot last season, which caused him to miss the first ten games. Bland returned and played in seven games.\n\nThis season, Bland played in 12 games, recording one interception and six pass breakups.\n\nMatt Eberflus will no longer be on the sideline during games.\n\nFRISCO, Texas – After a conversation with head coach Brian Schottenheimer, Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus is moving from the sideline to the coaching booth to call plays for Dallas’ defense.\n\nEberflus said on Thursday that it was not the first time he and Schottenheimer had discussed the possibility, but they now believe it’s best for the Cowboys heading into their final three games of the 2025 season.\n\n“I think that’s a really good thing,” Eberflus said. “[Schottenheimer] and I talked it through, and I’ve done it before. It’s really a chance for me to get good perspective, get good information, see the game develop in terms of information given to me on the sidelines… it’s been a while, but it’s going to be a good adjustment.”\n\nThe first time Eberflus was in the booth in the NFL was his first season, when he served as the Cleveland Browns’ linebackers coach from 2009-2010. In recent years as defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts and then head coach for the Chicago Bears, Eberflus has been on the field and has also served as the play caller.\n\nWith Eberflus calling plays upstairs, that means those on the sidelines need to be able to deliver adjustments, messages or whatever else Eberflus observes from upstairs. While there’ll be communication from Eberflus to all his position coaches, defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton will be the one tasked with messages for the defense as a whole.\n\nThe Cowboys injury list has been a long one for most of the season.\n\nOn Thursday, the Dallas Cowboys practiced again where it’s business as usual with a game against the Los Angeles Chargers coming up. Here’s where the Cowboys are regarding injuries.\n\nThe Cowboys’ secondary is banged up once again this week, as many of their defensive backs are on the injury report. DaRon Bland (foot) did not practice for a second consecutive day. Bland has been hampered by a foot injury sporadically this season, so far this week he’s not quite healthy. Aside from Bland, many of his secondary counterparts were limited on Thursday again. Caelen Carson (shoulder/hamstring), Trevon Diggs (knee), Josh Butler (knee), Shavon Revel (knee). In Diggs’ case, he believes that he feels well enough to play, but there are some obstacles he needs to clear with the team before returning to the field.\n\nThe George Pickens conversations over the last two weeks have gotten silly. He will (and should) be here for the foreseeable future.\n\nHow much, if anything, will Pickens’ disappearance the last couple of weeks when the season was on the line cost him in terms of the Cowboys’ willingness to make a long-term deal? — Michael S.\n\nNot much at all. They understand that a big part of it is the extra attention coming his way from opposing defenses. They also know how much more explosive the offense is with Pickens and CeeDee Lamb on the field together. If I had to predict today, Pickens will end up getting the franchise tag. He obviously won’t like that idea. I just have my doubts about Jerry Jones’ being able to get a deal done with David Mulugheta after how ugly things got with Micah Parsons. Jones could prove me wrong, but the tag is more likely at this point. Either way, I don’t see a scenario where Pickens is playing anywhere but Dallas next season.\n\nIt is (unfortunately) mock draft season for the Cowboys again.\n\n16. Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1), Keldric Faulk, edge, Auburn\n\nThis season, Faulk has taken a step back in production, but there is no denying he is an explosive pass rusher who would immediately improve the Cowboys’ attack on the edge.\n\n“Dallas has the NFL’s second-worst scoring defense, ranking fourth-worst in yards allowed. The Cowboys also have the league’s worst pass defense, but they have pieces at corner and have played much of the season without the injured Trevon Diggs,” Flick wrote. “So the pass rush that’s tied for ninth-worst with 29 sacks is a better place to start. The 6-foot-6, 285-pound Faulk, a team captain at Auburn, brings size, intelligence, and a tremendous athletic profile to the table.”\n\nLast season, Faulk totaled 45 tackles, 11 tackles for a loss, 7 sacks, and a forced fumble. This season, he totaled 29 tackles, five tackles for a loss, and two sacks.\n\nMost fans are probably tired of this being the team’s biggest accomplishment.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys retained their status as the world’s most valuable sports team, according to the list published by Forbes on Thursday that ​was dominated by National Football League clubs.\n\nThe NFL’s Cowboys, who unseated Spanish football club Real Madrid ‌for top spot on the list in 2016, ‌were valued at $13 billion, a 29% jump compared to last year, Forbes said.\n\nThe National Basketball Association’s Golden State Warriors ($11 billion), the NFL’s Los Angeles ⁠Rams($10.5 billion) and New York Giants ($10.1 billion), and the NBA’s ‌Los Angeles Lakers ($10 billion) rounded out the top five.\n\nForbes ​said 30 of the NFL’s 32 teams were on its top-50 list, which also included 12 NBA clubs and two each from Major League Baseball, Formula 1, LaLiga and the ‌Premier League.\n\nThe Cowboys have a big decision to make on Kenny Clark coming up this offseason.\n\nThis means the 2026 offseason will see “cap casualties,” as they will need extra money to operate in free agency, the trade market, and with upcoming extensions.\n\nSpecifically, there is one high-quality and new-to-Dallas player that may fall victim to the Cowboys’ financial constraints. Here, we’ll talk about him and the money it would save by releasing him in 2026.\n\nKenny Clark: In-And-Out Of Dallas Thanks To Salary Cap Issues\n\nSavings (via Over The Cap): $21.5 Million If Released\n\nCap Penalty/Dead Money (via Over The Cap): $0 If Released\n\nThat’s right, the man in question is the player Dallas received from Green Bay this summer in exchange for the All-Pro Parsons.\n\nKenny Clark, 30, joined the Cowboys, alongside two first-round picks, and has played well in a reformed interior defensive line that now includes both Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa. Due to the financial details above, the trio may last one season.",

    "fullText": "Dec. 15 (UPI) -- J.J. McCarthy threw for 250 yards and two scores to help the Minnesota Vikings put the Dallas Cowboys on the brink of playoff elimination.\n\nThe second-year quarterback completed 15 of 24 passes and also ran for a touchdown in the 34-26 triumph Sunday in Arlington, Texas.\n\nThe Cowboys outgained the Vikings 423-327 in total yards and held a five-minute edge in time of possession, but missed two field goals and failed to secure points on three of their five red-zone opportunities.\n\n\"I'm proud of our team,\" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters. \"It's the first time all year we've been able to stack a couple wins together. We knew it would be very, very difficult.\"\n\n: @SNFonNBC pic.twitter.com/pKkcz7rYi2— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) December 15, 2025\n\nO'Connell said the Vikings' goal was to get off to a fast start, but it was their foes who found the end zone first Sunday night at AT&T Stadium. Cowboys defensive tackle Quinnen Williams intercepted McCarthy's first pass of the night. Running back Javonte Williams found the end zone with a 1-yard run to end the resulting drive.\n\nThe Vikings tied the score when McCarthy connected with Jalen Nailor on a 20-yard touchdown pass about six minutes later. The Cowboys and Vikings exchanged blows for the remainder of the half, and the score was tied 17-17 at the break.\n\nPro Bowl kicker Brandon Aubrey made field goals on the Cowboys' first two drives of the second half for a 23-17 advantage. The Vikings responded with an eight-play, 73-yard scoring drive, which ended with a 1-yard run from fullback C.J. Ham.\n\nMcCarthy connected with Nailor for a second touchdown -- this one from 4 yards out -- about 5:48 into the fourth quarter for a 31-23 advantage and the Vikings never trailed again.\n\nVikings kicker Will Reichard made a 53-yard field goal with about a minute remaining. Aubrey, who missed 51- and 59-yard field goals earlier in the game, split the uprights from 41 yards out on the next drive to cut into the deficit. The Cowboys then failed to recover an onside kick, ending their hopes of a rally.\n\nPrescott completed 23 of 38 passes for 294 yards in the loss. Star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb caught six passes for 111 yards. Williams picked up 91 yards and a score on 15 carries. Fellow Cowboys running back Malik Hooker totaled 37 yards from scrimmage and a score on 10 touches.\n\nAubrey made 4 of 6 field goal attempts, with successful kicks from 37 and 26 yards, in addition to two 41-yard conversions.\n\nTight end T.J. Hockenson and wide receiver Jordan Addison totaled 66 receiving yards apiece for the Vikings. Jones totaled 65 yards from scrimmage on 15 touches in the Victory.\n\n: @SNFonNBC pic.twitter.com/q40LRbnKjO— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) December 15, 2025\n\nThe Cowboys (6-7-1), who were 3-5-1 through nine weeks, but rallied to reach playoff contention, can officially be eliminated Saturday if the Philadelphia Eagles (9-5) beat the Washington Commanders (4-10).\n\n\"We are professional football players,\" Prescott said. \"You've gotta come to work and give your absolute best, regardless. Unfortunately, I'm sure the playoffs are out of the picture. But it's about taking pride in who you are as a man and your job and everything that's gotten you to this point.\"\n\nPrescott and the Cowboys will host the Los Angeles Chargers (10-4) at 1 p.m. EST Sunday in Arlington, Texas. The Vikings (6-8) will face the New York Giants at 1 p.m. Sunday in East Rutherford, N.J.",

    "description": "The Packers made a blockbuster trade for former Cowboys defensive superstar Micah Parsons with winning the Super Bowl most in mind. Do they have enough talent without him to make a deep playoff run? The answer is no.",
    "fullText": "Micah Parsons’ injury impact: Why Packers won't win Super Bowl 60 without star edge rusher originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are one of several strong Super Bowl contenders from the NFC, even after Sunday's tough inter-conference loss at Denver, dropping them to 9-4-1 and the No. 7 seed. But they suffered a much more significant loss in the game with edge rusher Micah Parsons going down with what is feared to be a torn ACL.\n\nThe likely devastating knee injury means the Packers, as either NFC North champions or a wild-card team, won't have Parsons for the playoffs. Not only did he produce 12.5 sacks in 14 games, he has been terrific with his consistent pressure on quarterbacks. He also was better than expected against the run with the arguable best season in his career.\n\nUnfortunately, the Packers also weren't immune to the injury bug that bit Parsons in his final of four seasons with the Cowboys in 2024, only they probably won't be getting him back. Here's a look at whether Green Bay's defense or team as a whole is still capable of making a winning run through Super Bowl 60 without him:\n\nMORE: Micah Parsons injury update\n\nThough 14 games, the Packers as a team have 33 sacks, recording none against Bo Nix and the Broncos in their 34-26 loss in Week 15. Without Parsons at right defensive end, the healthy leading pass rusher is fellow starting end Rashan Gary, with 8.5. Gary has had a disappointing season and much of his production stems from the blocking attention on Parsons.\n\nDefensive tackle Devonte Wyatt is third on the team with 4 sacks, but he's also out for the season with an ankle injury. Backup end Kingsley Engabare, who also has been ineffective as a situational passer rusher has only 2 sacks to land fourth. He and Lukas Van Ness (only 1.5 sacks) will be pressed into more action to support Gary.\n\nThe Packers putting no heat on the Broncos' offensive line even before Parsons got hurt isn't a good sign. Green Bay remains a solid run defense, but now it is a missing the most important piece in trying to close out opponents in the second half.\n\nGreen Bay hasn't been giving Parsons much real support in the pass rush, making it even more difficult to replace him this late in the season.\n\nMORE: Latest updates, recovery time on Micah Parsons after left knee injury\n\nThe NFC is a top-heavy conference. There are lot of explosive passing games, led by the Rams and Matthew Stafford. The Bears, Eagles, Buccaneers, Seahawks and 49ers, the rest of the playoff-positioned teams ahead of Packers, also would get a huge break in potential matchups.\n\nThe Packers' playoff track record with Matt LaFleur is already shaky. They have gone 3-5 under their head coach and haven't advanced to the NFC championship game in five years. Navigating this field of heavyweights will be tough, especially without any home games.\n\nThe good news is, finishing with the Bears, Ravens and Vikings give the Packers games they win without Parsons. Given Green Bay beat Chicago in Week 14, there's a fair chance it can rally to still take the NFC North and get as high as the No. 2 seed again.\n\nThe bad news is, it will still be tough to beat the now No. 2 Bears a second time and the team already has lost to the No. 3 Eagles. The Packers are trending to face either a tough team from the NFC West (Seahawks or 49ers) at home or getting a tough rematch on the road.\n\nWith the conference title race so tight, missing one key player can make the difference. Outside of quarterback Jordan Love, Parsons is the Packers' most indispensable player.\n\nGreen Bay's Super Bowl odds are now trending against them. No Parsons is that significant of a blow.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings may be eliminated from playoff contention, but you could not tell by the way this team played tonight. The Vikings went into Dallas and defeated the Cowboys 34-26. The offense looks like it is finally finding some semblance of cohesion, but it still has those growing pains. However, those pains are tolerable as this team has dropped 30+ points in back-to-back games.\n\nWith the game officially wrapped up, let's take a look at the winners and losers from today's performance.\n\nNine is heating up. J.J. McCarthy has put together two nice outings and looks to be figuring some things out. In this one, he went 15/24 for 250 yards and a 2/1 TD/INT ratio. The decision-making has improved dramatically since coming back from his concussion, and when the tempo and accuracy start coming together, McCarthy just might figure things out.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings came into tonight's game ranked 22nd in the NFL in rushing yards per game. In the first half, the Vikings allowed just 44 yards. However, in the second half, the floodgates opened, as this team finished with 138 rush yards. Javonte Williams ran for 91 yards and a touchdown, averaging 6.1 yards per carry. There are certainly some things to clean up, and the rush defense needs to be a priority to sharpen up.\n\nJalen Nailor had his first career two-touchdown game, as he finished with just three receptions for 47 yards, but those two touchdowns were huge for this offense. Nailor appears to have the trust of McCarthy in the redzone, which, with the struggling connection with Justin Jefferson, McCarthy needs to have someone outside he can depend on. Speaking of which...\n\nYes, we have a neutral selection, but it needs to be talked about. The statistical performance was not good, as Justin Jefferson finished with just two receptions again for 22 yards. However, it is the eight targets that almost makes him a winner in my eyes. Jefferson had a touchdown early called back by a penalty, and another in the second half that went through his hands. The connection has struggled, yes, but this should be viewed as a positive stepping stone as we head toward the end of the season.\n\nAs we discussed at the top, the Minnesota Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention before the team took the field, as the franchise needed the Cleveland Browns to beat the Chicago Bears. It was a rough start to the year, and it is tough to find positives in this season now that it is basically over. But these last two games should instill some optimism about this franchise and whether they can keep this going.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Vikings Wire: Winners and Losers from Vikings Week 15 win over the Cowboys",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch the NFL game tonight\n\nEntering the final quarter of the NFL season, it’s officially do-or-die for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSitting at a precarious 6-6-1 after a damaging Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions, the Cowboys are clinging to life in the NFC playoff picture. The road to the NFC East crown has become a steep uphill climb, with the division-leading Philadelphia Eagles holding a significant advantage at 8-5. For Dallas, the margin for error has evaporated; it can no longer afford the inconsistent performances that have defined its season.\n\nWith the NFC wild-card race stacked — featuring contenders like the Lions, Panthers and Buccaneers — the Cowboys need a near-perfect run to separate themselves. Their remaining schedule features three of four games against NFC opponents with playoff implications. The crucible begins immediately in Week 15 with a pivotal home Sunday Night Football clash against the Minnesota Vikings (5-8).\n\nWhile Minnesota will almost certainly miss the playoffs, it provides a tough matchup for Dallas. The Vikings' defense is coming off a game where it shut out the Commanders, forcing three turnovers and giving up just over 200 yards in a 31-0 win. Offensively, while J.J. McCarthy has had his struggles in his first year as a starter, the Vikings still have plenty of weapons to boats, including a top wide receiver duo in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison; with these two, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, the receiving talent is off the charts.\n\nDallas needs a home primetime win to keep its playoff aspirations alive, while Minnesota is looking to build on the momentum it generated last week.\n\nFollow along for all the action from AT&T Stadium.\n\nSTREAM: Watch Vikings vs. Cowboys LIVE with Peacock\n\nNFL HQ:Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\n\n10:42 p.m.: Williams is back with two big carries.

    "description": "Here is what happened in the third quarter of Sunday night’s Cowboys game.",
    "fullText": "The Cowboys received mixed news as the second half started. Javonte Williams was back (and did well on his first carry), but Hunter Luepke was ruled out with a concussion. It was noted that the injury occurred on the final kickoff to end the first half.\n\nLuke Schoonmaker (really) had an amazing catch that put the Cowboys at the Minnesota 11-yard line. A play later it appeared that CeeDee Lamb was interfered with in the end zone, but nothing was called.\n\nUnfortunately the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal which felt like a failure. Still, points are points.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 20, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 26-yard field goal)\n\nThis will sound shocking, but it is true. The Dallas Cowboys defense pitched a three and out on their next drive. It was a Christmas miracle.\n\nDallas tried to get KaVontae Turpin involved on offense on the next possession, a curious move given that George Pickens had not really had many moments at this point in the game. But hey, whatever.\n\nThings stalled out yet again and Brandon Aubrey delivered once more.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 41-yard field goal)\n\nRight off the bat the Vikings were across midfield. Playing with your food has consequences.\n\nNot long after that the Vikings were up against the goal line. Keep in mind before you reed the next sentence that the previous Cowboys four possessions ended with a field goal kick (they missed one obviously).\n\nBoom. Vikings touchdown. The lead changed hands.\n\nC.J. Ham is in for the go-ahead touchdown\n\nMINvsDAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/Mr3FNwwnmg\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 24 (C.J. Ham touchdown)\n\nTwo plays into the second quarter… the Cowboys had a touchdown once more. This one was courtesy of Malik Davis who was (obviously) in for Javonte Williams.\n\nMALIK DAVIS TD! pic.twitter.com/C3fbKMycuX\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 7 (Malik Davis touchdown)\n\nThe Vikings made sure to show up for the next drive, though. They moved thoroughly down the field and kept getting in their own way to keep themselves from scoring a touchdown. They wound up with a short situation right on the goal line and then J.J. McCarthy pulled the Peyton Manning bootleg.\n\nEmbarrassing pic.twitter.com/AJugDLlRaS\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 14 (J.J. McCarthy touchdown)\n\nThe game was tied at this point which felt weird because it had for so long felt like Dallas was in control. The Cowboys nevertheless began moving once more and ultimately stalled out in field goal range. Brandon Aubrey, though.\n\nUnfortunately Aubrey pushed his 51-yard attempt wide to the right which kept things tied and gave the Vikings solid field position to work with.\n\nMinnesota was able to scrap out a field goal which gave them their first lead of the night. It set Dallas up with a chance to score and 1:48 to do so. Given that Dallas deferred to start the game the drive also offered a potential double-dip opportunity.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 17 (Will Reichard 29-yard field goal)\n\nThe Cowboys were able to work quickly to get in field goal range themselves. Given Aubrey’s recent miss there was a little bit of breath holding for the first time in a while with him.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 17, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 17-yard field goal)\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys won the toss and deferred which put the defense on the field first. Given that there were reports about how Logan Wilson was set to start at linebacker… it was exciting to say the least.\n\nIt took two plays for things to get legitimately exciting. Donovan Wilson got pressure in J.J. McCarthy’s face and wisely put his hand up to block a pass. That errant ball landed in the expectant arms of Quinnen Williams to give the Cowboys a turnover and more importantly… the ball!\n\nQUINNEN WILLIAMS INT! pic.twitter.com/ImWT83EQCu\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAfter a couple of plays the Cowboys appeared to stall out and had to settle for a Brandon Aubrey field goal. They didn’t, though! They ran a fake! And got it!\n\nBRANDON AUBREY WITH THE WHEELS pic.twitter.com/GGGBuE5B1i\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAmazingly the Cowboys got down to another fourth down and went for it yet again, although this time conventionally by way of a Javonte Williams run.\n\nAfter getting it Javonte was in the end zone one play later.\n\nJAVONTE TD! pic.twitter.com/3ObBLpnpmW\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 0 (Javonte Williams touchdown)\n\nThe Cowboys defense went to work and while they were not able to generate a turnover they did force a punt. Dante Fowler was a particular point of pride on the possession in question and helped stop Aaron Jones.\n\nUnfortunately KaVontae Turpin let a punt go that he maybe should have fielded. The bounce really worked against Dallas and put them just about on their own goal line.\n\nMalik Davis was in at running back for the possession as it was reported that Javonte Williams was dealing with a shoulder injury. Ultimately the Cowboys wound up punting after a three and out as they did not want to get too cute.\n\nIt took two plays once more for Minnesota to have a moment. On the first one of them Aaron Jones had a massive gain and a penalty added to it to make matters worse. A few seconds later J.J. McCarthy hit Jalen Nailor for a game-tying touchdown.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 7 (J.J. McCathy to Jalen Nailor touchdown)\n\nWhen the Cowboys took over it was noted by the NBC broadcast that Javonte Williams was questionable to return with a shoulder injury so that corroborated everything to date.\n\nDak Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb for a huge gain and the Cowboys were in striking distance as the opening quarter came to a close. To help matters a facemask penalty really put Dallas close to another score.",
