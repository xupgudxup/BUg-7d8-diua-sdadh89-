    "fullText": "The Cowboys are making a change to their defensive operations for the final three weeks of the season.\n\nDefensive coordinator Matt Eberflus told reporters on Thursday that he will call the team's defensive plays from the booth for the rest of the season. Eberflus has called plays from the sideline for the first 14 games, but said that he and head coach Brian Schottenheimer agreed it would be the right move for the team.\n\n\"I've done it before, it's been a while, but it's going to be a good adjustment,\" Eberflus said, via Tommy Yarrish of the team's website.\n\nWhile they haven't officially been eliminated from playoff contention at this point, it's almost certainly too late for the change to help the Cowboys made the playoffs. The team is 31st in the league in points allowed, however, and anything that might help them improve on that performance is worth a shot as the Cowboys start looking ahead to how they can be better in 2025.",

    "fullText": "Dec. 15 (UPI) -- J.J. McCarthy threw for 250 yards and two scores to help the Minnesota Vikings put the Dallas Cowboys on the brink of playoff elimination.\n\nThe second-year quarterback completed 15 of 24 passes and also ran for a touchdown in the 34-26 triumph Sunday in Arlington, Texas.\n\nThe Cowboys outgained the Vikings 423-327 in total yards and held a five-minute edge in time of possession, but missed two field goals and failed to secure points on three of their five red-zone opportunities.\n\n\"I'm proud of our team,\" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters. \"It's the first time all year we've been able to stack a couple wins together. We knew it would be very, very difficult.\"\n\n: @SNFonNBC pic.twitter.com/pKkcz7rYi2— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) December 15, 2025\n\nO'Connell said the Vikings' goal was to get off to a fast start, but it was their foes who found the end zone first Sunday night at AT&T Stadium. Cowboys defensive tackle Quinnen Williams intercepted McCarthy's first pass of the night. Running back Javonte Williams found the end zone with a 1-yard run to end the resulting drive.\n\nThe Vikings tied the score when McCarthy connected with Jalen Nailor on a 20-yard touchdown pass about six minutes later. The Cowboys and Vikings exchanged blows for the remainder of the half, and the score was tied 17-17 at the break.\n\nPro Bowl kicker Brandon Aubrey made field goals on the Cowboys' first two drives of the second half for a 23-17 advantage. The Vikings responded with an eight-play, 73-yard scoring drive, which ended with a 1-yard run from fullback C.J. Ham.\n\nMcCarthy connected with Nailor for a second touchdown -- this one from 4 yards out -- about 5:48 into the fourth quarter for a 31-23 advantage and the Vikings never trailed again.\n\nVikings kicker Will Reichard made a 53-yard field goal with about a minute remaining. Aubrey, who missed 51- and 59-yard field goals earlier in the game, split the uprights from 41 yards out on the next drive to cut into the deficit. The Cowboys then failed to recover an onside kick, ending their hopes of a rally.\n\nPrescott completed 23 of 38 passes for 294 yards in the loss. Star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb caught six passes for 111 yards. Williams picked up 91 yards and a score on 15 carries. Fellow Cowboys running back Malik Hooker totaled 37 yards from scrimmage and a score on 10 touches.\n\nAubrey made 4 of 6 field goal attempts, with successful kicks from 37 and 26 yards, in addition to two 41-yard conversions.\n\nTight end T.J. Hockenson and wide receiver Jordan Addison totaled 66 receiving yards apiece for the Vikings. Jones totaled 65 yards from scrimmage on 15 touches in the Victory.\n\n: @SNFonNBC pic.twitter.com/q40LRbnKjO— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) December 15, 2025\n\nThe Cowboys (6-7-1), who were 3-5-1 through nine weeks, but rallied to reach playoff contention, can officially be eliminated Saturday if the Philadelphia Eagles (9-5) beat the Washington Commanders (4-10).\n\n\"We are professional football players,\" Prescott said. \"You've gotta come to work and give your absolute best, regardless. Unfortunately, I'm sure the playoffs are out of the picture. But it's about taking pride in who you are as a man and your job and everything that's gotten you to this point.\"\n\nPrescott and the Cowboys will host the Los Angeles Chargers (10-4) at 1 p.m. EST Sunday in Arlington, Texas. The Vikings (6-8) will face the New York Giants at 1 p.m. Sunday in East Rutherford, N.J.",

    "description": "The Packers made a blockbuster trade for former Cowboys defensive superstar Micah Parsons with winning the Super Bowl most in mind. Do they have enough talent without him to make a deep playoff run? The answer is no.",
    "fullText": "Micah Parsons’ injury impact: Why Packers won't win Super Bowl 60 without star edge rusher originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are one of several strong Super Bowl contenders from the NFC, even after Sunday's tough inter-conference loss at Denver, dropping them to 9-4-1 and the No. 7 seed. But they suffered a much more significant loss in the game with edge rusher Micah Parsons going down with what is feared to be a torn ACL.\n\nThe likely devastating knee injury means the Packers, as either NFC North champions or a wild-card team, won't have Parsons for the playoffs. Not only did he produce 12.5 sacks in 14 games, he has been terrific with his consistent pressure on quarterbacks. He also was better than expected against the run with the arguable best season in his career.\n\nUnfortunately, the Packers also weren't immune to the injury bug that bit Parsons in his final of four seasons with the Cowboys in 2024, only they probably won't be getting him back. Here's a look at whether Green Bay's defense or team as a whole is still capable of making a winning run through Super Bowl 60 without him:\n\nMORE: Micah Parsons injury update\n\nThough 14 games, the Packers as a team have 33 sacks, recording none against Bo Nix and the Broncos in their 34-26 loss in Week 15. Without Parsons at right defensive end, the healthy leading pass rusher is fellow starting end Rashan Gary, with 8.5. Gary has had a disappointing season and much of his production stems from the blocking attention on Parsons.\n\nDefensive tackle Devonte Wyatt is third on the team with 4 sacks, but he's also out for the season with an ankle injury. Backup end Kingsley Engabare, who also has been ineffective as a situational passer rusher has only 2 sacks to land fourth. He and Lukas Van Ness (only 1.5 sacks) will be pressed into more action to support Gary.\n\nThe Packers putting no heat on the Broncos' offensive line even before Parsons got hurt isn't a good sign. Green Bay remains a solid run defense, but now it is a missing the most important piece in trying to close out opponents in the second half.\n\nGreen Bay hasn't been giving Parsons much real support in the pass rush, making it even more difficult to replace him this late in the season.\n\nMORE: Latest updates, recovery time on Micah Parsons after left knee injury\n\nThe NFC is a top-heavy conference. There are lot of explosive passing games, led by the Rams and Matthew Stafford. The Bears, Eagles, Buccaneers, Seahawks and 49ers, the rest of the playoff-positioned teams ahead of Packers, also would get a huge break in potential matchups.\n\nThe Packers' playoff track record with Matt LaFleur is already shaky. They have gone 3-5 under their head coach and haven't advanced to the NFC championship game in five years. Navigating this field of heavyweights will be tough, especially without any home games.\n\nThe good news is, finishing with the Bears, Ravens and Vikings give the Packers games they win without Parsons. Given Green Bay beat Chicago in Week 14, there's a fair chance it can rally to still take the NFC North and get as high as the No. 2 seed again.\n\nThe bad news is, it will still be tough to beat the now No. 2 Bears a second time and the team already has lost to the No. 3 Eagles. The Packers are trending to face either a tough team from the NFC West (Seahawks or 49ers) at home or getting a tough rematch on the road.\n\nWith the conference title race so tight, missing one key player can make the difference. Outside of quarterback Jordan Love, Parsons is the Packers' most indispensable player.\n\nGreen Bay's Super Bowl odds are now trending against them. No Parsons is that significant of a blow.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings may be eliminated from playoff contention, but you could not tell by the way this team played tonight. The Vikings went into Dallas and defeated the Cowboys 34-26. The offense looks like it is finally finding some semblance of cohesion, but it still has those growing pains. However, those pains are tolerable as this team has dropped 30+ points in back-to-back games.\n\nWith the game officially wrapped up, let's take a look at the winners and losers from today's performance.\n\nNine is heating up. J.J. McCarthy has put together two nice outings and looks to be figuring some things out. In this one, he went 15/24 for 250 yards and a 2/1 TD/INT ratio. The decision-making has improved dramatically since coming back from his concussion, and when the tempo and accuracy start coming together, McCarthy just might figure things out.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings came into tonight's game ranked 22nd in the NFL in rushing yards per game. In the first half, the Vikings allowed just 44 yards. However, in the second half, the floodgates opened, as this team finished with 138 rush yards. Javonte Williams ran for 91 yards and a touchdown, averaging 6.1 yards per carry. There are certainly some things to clean up, and the rush defense needs to be a priority to sharpen up.\n\nJalen Nailor had his first career two-touchdown game, as he finished with just three receptions for 47 yards, but those two touchdowns were huge for this offense. Nailor appears to have the trust of McCarthy in the redzone, which, with the struggling connection with Justin Jefferson, McCarthy needs to have someone outside he can depend on. Speaking of which...\n\nYes, we have a neutral selection, but it needs to be talked about. The statistical performance was not good, as Justin Jefferson finished with just two receptions again for 22 yards. However, it is the eight targets that almost makes him a winner in my eyes. Jefferson had a touchdown early called back by a penalty, and another in the second half that went through his hands. The connection has struggled, yes, but this should be viewed as a positive stepping stone as we head toward the end of the season.\n\nAs we discussed at the top, the Minnesota Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention before the team took the field, as the franchise needed the Cleveland Browns to beat the Chicago Bears. It was a rough start to the year, and it is tough to find positives in this season now that it is basically over. But these last two games should instill some optimism about this franchise and whether they can keep this going.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Vikings Wire: Winners and Losers from Vikings Week 15 win over the Cowboys",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch the NFL game tonight\n\nEntering the final quarter of the NFL season, it’s officially do-or-die for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSitting at a precarious 6-6-1 after a damaging Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions, the Cowboys are clinging to life in the NFC playoff picture. The road to the NFC East crown has become a steep uphill climb, with the division-leading Philadelphia Eagles holding a significant advantage at 8-5. For Dallas, the margin for error has evaporated; it can no longer afford the inconsistent performances that have defined its season.\n\nWith the NFC wild-card race stacked — featuring contenders like the Lions, Panthers and Buccaneers — the Cowboys need a near-perfect run to separate themselves. Their remaining schedule features three of four games against NFC opponents with playoff implications. The crucible begins immediately in Week 15 with a pivotal home Sunday Night Football clash against the Minnesota Vikings (5-8).\n\nWhile Minnesota will almost certainly miss the playoffs, it provides a tough matchup for Dallas. The Vikings' defense is coming off a game where it shut out the Commanders, forcing three turnovers and giving up just over 200 yards in a 31-0 win. Offensively, while J.J. McCarthy has had his struggles in his first year as a starter, the Vikings still have plenty of weapons to boats, including a top wide receiver duo in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison; with these two, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, the receiving talent is off the charts.\n\nDallas needs a home primetime win to keep its playoff aspirations alive, while Minnesota is looking to build on the momentum it generated last week.\n\nFollow along for all the action from AT&T Stadium.\n\nSTREAM: Watch Vikings vs. Cowboys LIVE with Peacock\n\nNFL HQ:Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\n\n10:42 p.m.: Williams is back with two big carries.

    "description": "Here is what happened in the third quarter of Sunday night’s Cowboys game.",
    "fullText": "The Cowboys received mixed news as the second half started. Javonte Williams was back (and did well on his first carry), but Hunter Luepke was ruled out with a concussion. It was noted that the injury occurred on the final kickoff to end the first half.\n\nLuke Schoonmaker (really) had an amazing catch that put the Cowboys at the Minnesota 11-yard line. A play later it appeared that CeeDee Lamb was interfered with in the end zone, but nothing was called.\n\nUnfortunately the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal which felt like a failure. Still, points are points.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 20, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 26-yard field goal)\n\nThis will sound shocking, but it is true. The Dallas Cowboys defense pitched a three and out on their next drive. It was a Christmas miracle.\n\nDallas tried to get KaVontae Turpin involved on offense on the next possession, a curious move given that George Pickens had not really had many moments at this point in the game. But hey, whatever.\n\nThings stalled out yet again and Brandon Aubrey delivered once more.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 41-yard field goal)\n\nRight off the bat the Vikings were across midfield. Playing with your food has consequences.\n\nNot long after that the Vikings were up against the goal line. Keep in mind before you reed the next sentence that the previous Cowboys four possessions ended with a field goal kick (they missed one obviously).\n\nBoom. Vikings touchdown. The lead changed hands.\n\nC.J. Ham is in for the go-ahead touchdown\n\nMINvsDAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/Mr3FNwwnmg\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 24 (C.J. Ham touchdown)\n\nTwo plays into the second quarter… the Cowboys had a touchdown once more. This one was courtesy of Malik Davis who was (obviously) in for Javonte Williams.\n\nMALIK DAVIS TD! pic.twitter.com/C3fbKMycuX\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 7 (Malik Davis touchdown)\n\nThe Vikings made sure to show up for the next drive, though. They moved thoroughly down the field and kept getting in their own way to keep themselves from scoring a touchdown. They wound up with a short situation right on the goal line and then J.J. McCarthy pulled the Peyton Manning bootleg.\n\nEmbarrassing pic.twitter.com/AJugDLlRaS\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 14 (J.J. McCarthy touchdown)\n\nThe game was tied at this point which felt weird because it had for so long felt like Dallas was in control. The Cowboys nevertheless began moving once more and ultimately stalled out in field goal range. Brandon Aubrey, though.\n\nUnfortunately Aubrey pushed his 51-yard attempt wide to the right which kept things tied and gave the Vikings solid field position to work with.\n\nMinnesota was able to scrap out a field goal which gave them their first lead of the night. It set Dallas up with a chance to score and 1:48 to do so. Given that Dallas deferred to start the game the drive also offered a potential double-dip opportunity.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 17 (Will Reichard 29-yard field goal)\n\nThe Cowboys were able to work quickly to get in field goal range themselves. Given Aubrey’s recent miss there was a little bit of breath holding for the first time in a while with him.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 17, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 17-yard field goal)\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys won the toss and deferred which put the defense on the field first. Given that there were reports about how Logan Wilson was set to start at linebacker… it was exciting to say the least.\n\nIt took two plays for things to get legitimately exciting. Donovan Wilson got pressure in J.J. McCarthy’s face and wisely put his hand up to block a pass. That errant ball landed in the expectant arms of Quinnen Williams to give the Cowboys a turnover and more importantly… the ball!\n\nQUINNEN WILLIAMS INT! pic.twitter.com/ImWT83EQCu\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAfter a couple of plays the Cowboys appeared to stall out and had to settle for a Brandon Aubrey field goal. They didn’t, though! They ran a fake! And got it!\n\nBRANDON AUBREY WITH THE WHEELS pic.twitter.com/GGGBuE5B1i\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAmazingly the Cowboys got down to another fourth down and went for it yet again, although this time conventionally by way of a Javonte Williams run.\n\nAfter getting it Javonte was in the end zone one play later.\n\nJAVONTE TD! pic.twitter.com/3ObBLpnpmW\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 0 (Javonte Williams touchdown)\n\nThe Cowboys defense went to work and while they were not able to generate a turnover they did force a punt. Dante Fowler was a particular point of pride on the possession in question and helped stop Aaron Jones.\n\nUnfortunately KaVontae Turpin let a punt go that he maybe should have fielded. The bounce really worked against Dallas and put them just about on their own goal line.\n\nMalik Davis was in at running back for the possession as it was reported that Javonte Williams was dealing with a shoulder injury. Ultimately the Cowboys wound up punting after a three and out as they did not want to get too cute.\n\nIt took two plays once more for Minnesota to have a moment. On the first one of them Aaron Jones had a massive gain and a penalty added to it to make matters worse. A few seconds later J.J. McCarthy hit Jalen Nailor for a game-tying touchdown.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 7 (J.J. McCathy to Jalen Nailor touchdown)\n\nWhen the Cowboys took over it was noted by the NBC broadcast that Javonte Williams was questionable to return with a shoulder injury so that corroborated everything to date.\n\nDak Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb for a huge gain and the Cowboys were in striking distance as the opening quarter came to a close. To help matters a facemask penalty really put Dallas close to another score.",
