    "fullText": "DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic had 39 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his NBA-leading 12th triple-double of the season as the Denver Nuggets outlasted the Houston Rockets 128-125 in overtime on Monday night in a matchup of two of the top three teams in the Western Conference standings.\n\nJamal Murray added 35 points for Denver, including six of his team’s 11 points in overtime. Murray made 14 of his 15 free-throw attempts.\n\nThe win was the Nuggets’ fifth in a row and was their first home victory since Nov. 8.\n\nThe final 1:40 of regulation had four ties and four lead changes, a stretch capped off by a free throw by Murray that tied the game with 2.3 seconds remaining after an away-from-play foul on Houston’s Amen Thompson. Denver retained possession after the free throw, but a 3-point attempt by Jokic from the top of the key was long.\n\nThe Nuggets took a 124-117 lead after a Spencer Jones 3 with 2:59 remaining in overtime, but the Rockets clawed back, getting within three with the ball and 13 seconds remaining. Alperen Sengun missed a contested 24-foot 3 with 4.9 seconds remaining, allowing Denver to hold on for the victory.\n\nSengun paced the Rockets with 33 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first triple-double of the season. Kevin Durant added 25 points, seven assists, five rebounds and five blocks for Houston, which lost its third consecutive road game.\n\nA Nuggets team that was already down two starters in Aaron Gordon (hamstring) and Christian Braun (ankle) played much of the game without starting guard Peyton Watson, who left six minutes into the first quarter after suffering a right trunk contusion.\n\nRockets: At the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday.\n\nNuggets: Host the Orlando Magic on Thursday.\n\nAP NBA: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "description": "Former NBA star Paul Pierce didn't hold back when he described the Lakers' poor decision-making in the final minutes of Sunday's win over the Suns.",
    "fullText": "Late in the third quarter of their Sunday matchup against the Phoenix Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers started to play the type of winning defense that their fans have been practically begging for. During a stretch of roughly 10 minutes that extended into the fourth quarter, they scored 24 unanswered points and forced seven turnovers, allowing them to take a 95-77 lead.\n\nHowever, after that outstanding spurt, the Lakers fell back into their old bad habits on both ends of the floor. They started to walk the ball upcourt and milk the shot clock, as if they were merely looking to conservatively protect their lead rather than build on it and hold off Phoenix. That behavior played right into Phoenix's hands, and they ended up having to pull out a 116-114 victory by the skin of their teeth after the Suns made a couple of big mistakes in the final seconds.\n\nIt was another reminder that the Lakers still have a lot of work to do in order to seriously contend for the NBA championship.\n\nHall of Famer Paul Pierce went off on them during a recent episode of the \"No Fouls Given\" podcast for the way they gave up their lead in the last several minutes of Sunday's game. He said the Lakers — and the Suns — had very poor basketball IQ in the final minutes of that contest, and that neither team will be able to win a playoff series this spring as a result.\n\n\"This was one of the lowest IQ, last four minutes I've seen from both teams this season. And based on what I saw, neither one of these teams can win a playoff series.\"\n\nOf course, the Lakers are likely not as reckless and undisciplined as they looked in the final minutes of Sunday's game, nor are they as good a defensive team as they looked during that 10-minute stretch late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter. They do have an 18-7 record, which gives them an elite winning percentage, and are in third place in the Western Conference.\n\nBut Los Angeles hasn't played the Denver Nuggets, Houston Rockets or New York Knicks yet, and when it faced the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder a month ago, it lost 121-92, albeit with LeBron James still out due to sciatica. Continuing to put forth the same ineptitude they displayed late in Sunday's game will almost certainly result in decisive losses against the Nuggets, Rockets, Knicks and especially the Thunder.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Paul Pierce on Lakers' basketball IQ in crunch time of Sunday's game",

    "fullText": "Victor Wembanyama made a triumphant return from injury to lead the San Antonio Spurs to a stunning NBA Cup semi-final upset of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday as the New York Knicks downed the Orlando Magic to book their place in the final.\n\nFrench prodigy Wembanyama, who has missed the Spurs' last 12 games after suffering a left calf strain last month, produced a dominant performance at both ends of the court to set up a thrilling 111-109 victory at Las Vegas's T-Mobile Arena.\n\nThe 7ft 4in (2.24m) 21-year-old finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in 21 minutes on court, helping the Spurs climb out of a 16-point hole in the second quarter to inflict only the second Oklahoma City defeat this season.\n\nNBA champions Oklahoma City had gone into the game on the back of a 16-game winning streak, boasting a 24-1 record for the season that had prompted talk of them breaking Golden State's record 73-win season.\n\nBut after making a smooth start to control the game, Wembanyama began to make his presence felt off the bench in the second quarter to breathe new life into the San Antonio ranks.\n\n\"I knew I had limited minutes so I had to make the most out of it,\" Wembanyama said.\n\n\"Winning against a team like this, it might seem like it's just a game but it's a collective effort and it's not an easy thing.\n\n\"It's only their second loss of the season. It means something.\"\n\nWembanyama was one of four San Antonio players to finish with double figures, with Devin Vassell scoring 23, and Stephon Castle and De'Aaron Fox adding 22 apiece.\n\n\"It says a lot. And it says a lot about where this team is going to be in the future,\" he said.\n\nReigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder scoring with 29 points, while Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren added 17 points each.\n\nIn Saturday's other semi-final, Jalen Brunson scored 40 points to power the New York Knicks to their first NBA Cup final with a 132-120 win over the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe Knicks' in-form offense proved too hot for injury-hit Orlando as New York took their recent streak to nine wins from 10 games.\n\n\"We came out here and did exactly what we said we wanted to do, which was play Knicks basketball,\" said Karl-Anthony Towns, who backed Brunson with 29 points.\n\nThe Magic had led 36-33 after making a rapid start to a breathless opening quarter -- earning the Knicks players some harsh and fiery words from coach Mike Brown in an early timeout.\n\n\"The way they came out, physicality-wise, we weren't ready for it,\" said Brunson.\n\n\"We bounced back and responded to that, and the way we played the rest of the game is a testament to that first timeout.\"\n\nNew York went on a tear at the start of the second quarter, capitalizing on a missed floating jump shot from Desmond Bane to take the lead through Josh Hart.\n\nThe Knicks briefly relinquished their advantage soon after half-time, when Bane put the Magic back ahead with a running layup.\n\nBut Orlando ultimately could not keep pace with Brunson, who late in the third quarter left opposing guard Anthony Black sitting helplessly on the floor before executing a three-point step-back jumpshot.\n\nOrlando's Jalen Suggs managed a team-high 26 points, but failed to complete the game after suffering with an apparent injury to his left side.\n\nThe Magic also felt the absence of Franz Wagner, their leading scorer this season.\n\nThe NBA Cup, a mid-season knockout tournament now in its third year, is proving a hit with audiences and players.\n\nIt now offers a tantalizing opportunity for the Knicks to win their first overall trophy since 1973.",

    "fullText": "76ers rookie named one of best NBA players under 25 years old originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne thing that the Philadelphia 76ers have been able to do relatively well over the past decade or so is infusing the roster with young talent.\n\nBack in 2017, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were both ranked highly on ESPN’s list of the top NBA players under 25 years old. Embiid ranked No. 4 on the list that year, and Simmons placed 10th.\n\nLast year, guard Tyrese Maxey came in at No. 6 on The Ringer’s iteration of the top players under 25 list. This year, it’s V.J. Edgecombe’s turn. Philadelphia’s prized rookie was recently ranked by ESPN as the 19th-best player under 25.\n\n\"While there have been some predictable rookie growing pains, Edgecombe has largely rewarded the 76ers' decision to pick him third, with his explosiveness attacking the paint and flashes of defensive playmaking that point to major long-term upside. The future of the franchise rests on Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey, and how well Philly can develop them in tandem.\"\n\nEdgecombe stepped right into a starting spot for the Sixers this season, and he’s been impressive. In 21 appearances, he’s averaging 14.7 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.3 steals per performance.\n\nWhile the raw numbers aren’t staggering, Edgecombe has shown the Sixers everything that they could have hoped to see from him at this early point in his career. He’s an elite athlete who can get to the rim almost at will and finish once there. He’s also shown an ability to space the floor, as he’s shooting 38 percent from long range and nearly 44 percent on catch-and-shoot opportunities from distance.\n\nBut, he’s been perhaps even more impressive on the defensive end where he’s shown the potential to be an elite perimeter defender. Last month, Sixers coach Nick Nurse even referred to Edgecombe as one of the best defenders on the team. He truly has All-Defensive team talent and potential.\n\nAs we've seen with the likes of Ben Simmons, being named as one of the best players under 25 isn't a guarantee that a player's potential will be realized, but it's high praise nonetheless, especially for a rookie.",

    "fullText": "Jalen Brunson's first 40-point game of the year couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nThe All-Star point guard dropped a season-high on Saturday night to lead the Knicks over the Orlando Magic and advance to the NBA Cup Championship on Tuesday night in Las Vegas.\n\nBrunson's scoring outburst came on 16-of-27 shooting (59.3 percent), despite going 2-of-5 from three-point land and only making six free throws. He also added in eight assists, four rebounds, and a steal over 39 minutes in the 132-120 win.\n\nAfter the victory, Brunson spoke with the NBA on Prime crew about his performance and how his game continues to improve, especially on the big stages.\n\n\"I think the way we've been playing, I've been able to get a couple more catch and shoots. I have a lot of confidence in my shot,\" Brunson said. \"I work way too hard not to be confident. Sometimes it's going to go in, and when it's going in I'm just going to keep firing them.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old was then asked by former two-time MVP Steve Nash about his \"touch around the rim\" and how that keeps getting better over the course of his career.\n\n\"It's something I had to learn,\" Brunson said. \"Obviously I'm not the tallest and I'm not jumping over people... My game's unique. I play off balance. I'm on balance, but most people wouldn't be. That's the stuff I work on, just be deceiving. I've done it for a long time and it keeps getting better and better like you said.\"\n\nBrunson's previous season-high in scoring was 37 points, which he's had twice this year (against the Heat on Oct. 26 and vs. the Bucks on Nov. 28). He's now averaging 28.3 points per game over 22 contests and has scored 30-plus points in four consecutive games.\n\nNew York, winners of five straight games, will need Brunson to continue playing with that confidence to keep their streak going on Tuesday night in the NBA Cup Championship against the winner of the Thunder-Spurs semifinal game.\n\n\"I work way too hard not to be confident ... my game is unique.\"\n\nJalen Brunson tells the crew about the parts of his game that keep getting better. pic.twitter.com/D83qzUnMmF\n\n— NBA on Prime (@NBAonPrime) December 14, 2025",

    "fullText": "The San Antonio Spurs are headed to the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, 132-119, on Wednesday, and might have Victor Wembanyama back in the lineup for the big tournament matchup. Following the team’s quarterfinal victory over the Lakers on Wednesday, Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson to reporters that Wemby might be ready to make his return from injury over the weekend.\n\n“Very much so,” coach Johnson said. “He had a really good day today. He had a very intense day this morning, and we’ll have to see how he responds or reacts (Thursday).”\n\nWemby went through an intense workout on Wednesday morning and then worked out again during pregame warmups before the Lakers game. He was able to get through that workout without any extra protection on his strained calf, according to Johnson.\n\nWembanyama has been sidelined with his calf strain and hasn’t played since Nov. 16. However, the Spurs have been able to get through this stretch and post a 9-3 record without their All-Star big man and defensive anchor. Wemby’s potential return couldn’t come at a better time as the Spurs will face the defending NBA Champion Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nIn Wembanyama's absence, other players like last season's Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle have had to step up even more to help carry the load. In Wednesday's win over the Lakers, Castle scored 30 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and dished 6 assists. De'Aaron Fox chipped in with 20 points, and Keldon Johnson scored 17 off the bench.\n\n“I think Victor would tell you we have a deep team, and we rely upon playing together as a team,” Johnson said. “He may be the biggest puzzle piece, but he needs everybody else to complete the puzzle.”\n\nAlthough Wemby has missed half of San Antonio’s 24 games this season, the Spurs are 17-7 overall and currently fifth in the Western Conference. When Wembanyama is on the court, he’s been as dominant as ever this season, averaging career-highs of 26.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, along with 3.6 blocks.\n\nSan Antonio and OKC square off in the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday, Dec. 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The NBA Cup championship game will be played on Dec. 16 in Las Vegas.",

    "fullText": "Any chance the Lakers had at trying to capture a second NBA Cup championship in the third season of the tournament evaporated for good in the fourth quarter against a young, fast and athletic San Antonio Spurs team missing its best player.\n\nThe Lakers won the inaugural NBA Cup title in 2023 and had designs on winning it again in 2025 and the $500,000 cash that goes to each player on the championship team.\n\nBut it was not to be — not with the Lakers unable to slow down the Spurs during a 132-119 quarterfinal loss Wednesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers got down by as much as 24 points in the fourth and made a run to get to within eight points late in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Lakers got no closer and now will face the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday.\n\nThe Spurs will meet the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in Las Vegas in the semifinals.\n\nLuka Doncic had 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists, Marcus Smart came off the bench to score 26 and LeBron James had 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. But that wasn’t enough against a Spurs team that had seven players score in double figures.\n\nStephon Castle led the Spurs with 30 points and De’Aaron Fox had 20.\n\nWhen the Lakers needed someone to lift them when they got down by 18 points in the second, someone to provide them a spark when there wasn’t one for so much of the quarter, they finally got it from the oldest player on the court, 40-year-old LeBron James.\n\nJames drove down the lane and threw down a thunderous dunk over Spurs 7-1 center Luke Kornet, bringing the Lakers to within eight points and charging up the crowd in the process.\n\nJames growled and yelled in the face of the reeling Kornet. The crowd stood and cheered, now happy that there was a Lakers’ awakening.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t hold on to that momentum, falling behind 70-58 at the half.\n\nAnd then when the third quarter started, the Lakers came out flat, giving up back-to-back threes and two more easy baskets for the Spurs to fall into an 80-60 hole early in the third.\n\nThe Lakers didn’t make it easy on themselves either.\n\nDoncic got a technical foul in the first quarter after no foul was called after Kelly Olynyk smacked him in the face and Lakers coach JJ Redick was called for a technical foul in the second quarter.\n\nWhen the Lakers last faced the Spurs a little over a month ago here, San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama played in a game L.A. won, but speedy point guard De’Aaron Fox did not.\n\nIt was the opposite this time, with Fox playing and Wembanyama out with a left calf strain.\n\nThe 7-5 Wembanyama has been out for almost a month and the super-quick Fox has been back during that time, which has changed the dynamic of the Spurs, which meant the Lakers had to shift how they played defense against San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs are more guard-oriented with Fox, Castle and Dylan Harper.\n\nThe Lakers got a taste of how much faster the Spurs are now in the first quarter, when L.A. gave up 39 points and trailed by nine after the first frame.\n\nThe Spurs show 56% from the field in the first, 50% (six-for-12) from three-point range.\n\nKeldon Johnson came off the bench to score 13 points in the first quarter for the Spurs.\n\n\"Yeah, they're running a lot of pick and rolls with Fox, a lot of pick and rolls with Castle and Harper,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said pregame about the Spurs’ new way of playing. “And all those pick and rolls lead to drives, those pick and rolls lead to kick-outs and catch two threes and then more drives. So, we've got to do a good job of containing the basketball and do a good job of contesting.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James has fresh legs and no Victor Wembanyama to worry about when his Los Angeles Lakers host the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Cup quarterfinals tonight.\n\nHere are my best Spurs vs. Lakers predictions and NBA picks for December 10.\n\nSpurs vs Lakers best bet: LeBron James Over 18.5 points (-115)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have a full battery after last playing on December 7. That break will have the aging legs of LeBron James going all out in this NBA Cup contest.\n\nA game removed from his insane 10-point streak getting snapped, James put in his best performance of the season so far (he’s only played in seven games since returning in mid-November).\n\nHe shot 12-for-17 from the floor, including 4-for-6 from 3-point range, and scored 29 points in the win over the 76eron s Sunday. LeBron was mired in a shooting funk the three games prior, going a collective 12-for-40 in those showings (30%).\n\n“Just at 40 years old, I mean, it just takes a while for my body to kind of get back into a rhythm,” James told the media about snapping his shooting skid. “And so, it felt good tonight to kind of feel like myself a little bit, being able to run and jump and cut and catch my second wind a lot faster tonight. Hopefully that stays.”\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs were hoping to have Victor Wembanyama back for this tournament tilt as he traveled with the team to L.A. However, the Spurs were quick to announce that he would not play, updating his status last night.\n\nSan Antonio desperately misses the 7-footer on both ends of the floor, but the defense has seen a notable slip without Wemby’s length causing chaos. The Spurs were the No. 6 team in advanced defensive rating before his injury in mid-November and have slid to 21st in that metric in the 11 games without him.\n\nThe interior protection has fallen off a cliff without Wembanyama’s 8-foot-4 wingspan blocking and changing shots. San Antonio allows the second fewest points in the paint per game (40) with him in action, but sees opponents’ PITP surge to 55.6 (29th) since his calf injury.\n\nJames is averaging 7.7 PITP in his first seven games since missing the start of the schedule with back issues — making up 48% of this scoring output. Against the Sixers on Sunday, LeBron upped that inside presence to 10 points in the painted area.\n\nProjections for today’s NBA Cup game have James pegged for around 17 points, but with models updating for Wembanyama’s absence, those forecasts sit closer to 20 points against the Spurs tonight.\n\nJames looks like he worked off the rust and can attack this Spurs interior without Wemby on the court.\n\nSan Antonio’s defensive chops have crumbled without their star in the middle. The Spurs have gone Over the total in five of their last six games.\n\nThe Lakers just have too much firepower for the Spurs to handle, especially on their home court.\n\nHarrison Barnes has upped his scoring in Wembanyama’s absence and scored 24 last time out against the Pelicans.\n\nHarrison Barnes Over 12.5 points\n\nSpread: Spurs +6.5 | Lakers -6.5\n\nMoneyline: Spurs +200 | Lakers -240\n\nOver/Under: Over 237.5 | Under 237.5\n\nThe Spurs are 8-4 Over/Under as a visitor this season and have topped the total in 57% of their road games going back to last season.

    "fullText": "A pizza chain founded by the brother of tennis star Michael Chang, and once backed by NBA superstar Kevin Durant, is seeking bankruptcy protection after years of store closures.\n\nThe parent company of Pieology filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in California, stating that its debts exceed its assets by at least double. The filing lists over 200 creditors, including many landlords and vendors.\n\nThe chain, founded in 2011, built its reputation on letting customers \"craft\" their own pizzas, calzones, and other foods. By 2022, it was boasting 130 locations in a press release announcing Shawn Thompson, a former Tim Hortons executive, as its CEO.\n\nIts website lists nearly 40 locations, mainly in California, but also in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. Thompson, whose LinkedIn page suggests his term as CEO ended last month, didn't return a request for comment.\n\nRepresentatives for Pieology, which is expected to continue operating while the bankruptcy proceeds, didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to the bankruptcy filing for Pieology's parent company, The Little Brown Box Pizza, Chang is also seeking bankruptcy protection for a company called Kustom Partner, which appears to be the administrative arm of Pieology.\n\nThe two companies filed for a form of Chapter 11 designed for small businesses that allows them to keep operating while they restructure their debts under court supervision.\n\nListed among Kustom Partner's creditors were numerous tax collectors from Florida, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii, Idaho, Georgia, Arizona, and more.\n\nIn a 2017 story about Durant's investment in Pieology, the basketball legend told ESPN that he was \"impressed with the quality\" of the pizza chain. Representatives for Durant didn't return a request for comment about the status of their investment. Pieology's bankruptcy filing said no one owns more than 10% of the company, suggesting no current institutional owners.\n\nThe Little Brown Box Pizza listed assets of between $100,000 and $500,000 compared to liabilities, or money owed, of between $1 million and $10 million.",

    "description": "Pacers Tyrese Haliburton will make his NBA on Prime debut as a player contributor on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "Indiana Pacers fans don't have to wait until next season to see Tyrese Haliburton make his season debut ... as a broadcaster, that is.\n\nHaliburton will make his debut as a player contributor on \"NBA on Prime\" with an appearance on \"NBA Nightcap\" following Tuesday night's NBA Cup quarterfinals matchups — the first of five such appearances this season. On \"NBA Nightcap,\" Haliburton is expected to offer commentary on his rehab and game insights for the 2025-26 season.\n\nThe postgame analysis show is in its first season, hosted by broadcaster Taylor Rooks, featuring former NBA legends Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, Steve Nash and Udonis Haslem, discussing the evening's NBA action.\n\nWhen discussing the opportunity with The Athletic, Haliburton spoke highly of the positivity of the broadcast's coverage and its ability to reach the casual fan:\n\n\"I think just being able to talk about the game with people, and not always having to be so critical of players, but just how we can talk about the game and put today’s players in the right limelight. I think it is important.\"\n\n\"I think that our league, arguably, is one of the only leagues where people are so critical of players that sometimes it can create opinions from the casual fan that they don’t even know what they’re talking about.\"\n\n“It’s just what they’re hearing on television. I think that Prime is doing a great job of just allowing former players to come on and celebrate our game, which I think is better just overall for everybody.”\n\nLast season, Haliburton averaged 18.6 points, 9.2 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game. His late-game heroics in the playoffs helped lead the Pacers to beat the Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers and the New York Knicks to advance to their first NBA Finals appearance since 2000.\n\nThis year, the Pacers have struggled to fill Haliburton's void as a scorer and playmaker. The Pacers are 6-18, currently 14th in the Eastern Conference, while ranking 29th in points per game and last in field goal percentage. Last season, they were seventh and third in those categories, respectively.\n\nPascal Siakam is the team's leading scorer this season, averaging 24.5 points, 7 rebounds and 4.1 assists. Fourth-year guard Bennedict Mathurin is also having a career campaign, averaging 21.5 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game.\n\nThe Pacers have struggled to create assists without their leading playmaker, giving Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell expanded playmaking roles. The Pacers are last in assists, averaging 23.5 per game. Last season, they were third in assists per game, averaging 29.2 per game.\n\nInjuries have also taken a toll on this team, with Mathurin, Nembhard and Obi Toppin all missing a significant portion of the early season. The Pacers are currently on a two-game winning streak and play the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.",

    "description": "Bet on Scottie Barnes from beyond the arc in our Knicks vs. Raptors picks, odds & expert predictions for the NBA Cup Quarterfinals on Tuesday, December 9.",
    "fullText": "The Toronto Raptors were roaring when they earned one of the top seeds in the NBA Cup, but then RJ Barrett got hurt, and suddenly the Raptors looked toothless.\n\nBut they’ll need to find some bite from beyond the arc if they want to move on to the semifinals against a New York Knicks team that’s playing some great basketball.\n\nMy Knicks vs. Raptors predictions break down this NBA Cup quarterfinals matchup with my best NBA picks.\n\nKnicks vs Raptors best bet: Scottie Barnes Over 1.5 threes (+140)\n\nIt’s pretty clear at this point what RJ Barrett has meant to the Toronto Raptors this season.\n\nToronto was in a groove with a 12-5 record before Barrett hurt his knee in a November 23 meeting with the Brooklyn Nets. Since them, the Raptors are just 3-5 straight up and 1-7 against the spread, including 1-5 SU and 0-6 ATS in their last six overall.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Knicks are starting to play their best basketball of the season. They are 7-1 SU/ATS in their last eight overall, which includes a 116-94 win over the Raps at Madison Square Garden back on November 30.\n\nHowever, the Knicks are an interesting team. They basically live and die by the three-ball. New York attempts the sixth-most threes per game with the fifth-highest shooting percentage while at the same time allowing opponents to take the fourth-most threes per game and ranking 19th in opponent three-point shooting percentage.\n\nNow, with the way these teams are trending, I lean toward the Knicks covering this spread, but one of the Raptors' strengths is defending the perimeter (third-best opponent three-point shooting perentage), and are a better team at home, so I hesitate a little there.\n\nBut someone without hesitation for the Raptors this season is Scottie Barnes. The former Rookie of the Year is having a great season, averaging 20 points, 8.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game. He is also shooting the ball better than ever before, draining a career-high 39.8% of his threes.\n\nHe’s shooting 40% from beyond the arc over his last five games, hitting two or more three times. That includes going 4-for-7 from deep in that November 30 meeting against the Knicks.\n\nThe Raptors know if they want to pull off the upset in this NBA Cup quarterfinal, they’ll have to hit some threes, so there is a ton of value for Barnes to nail a few more on Tuesday night.\n\nWhile it didn’t quite make best bet status, I’ll happily add Knicks -4.5 to this SGP. Not only does it not create the negative correlation we love for these SGPs, but New York is just playing very well right now.\n\nThe Knicks have won seven of their last eight games with a net rating that only trails the Oklahoma City Thunder during that stretch. With the Raptors still struggling to find consistency without RJ Barrett, it’s hard to back them when it comes to covering this number in this spot.\n\nAnd it’s the Raptors' offense that has really struggled in Barrett’s absence. They rank next-to-last in offensive rating since Barrett got hurt, and the Under is 6-3 in those nine games without him. That includes the most recent matchup with the Knicks.\n\nOG Anunoby returns to Toronto with a bang. In his second game back from injury he went 5-for-7 from three and you know he's comfortable in Scotiabank Arena.\n\nSpread: Knicks -4.5 | Raptors +4.5\n\nMoneyline: Knicks -190 | Raptors +165\n\nOver/Under: Over 226.5 | Under 226.5\n\nThe Raptors are 0-7 against the spread in their last seven games in a row. All without RJ Barrett, who will be out once again Tuesday night.

    "description": "HoopsHype ranks the five players who have appeared most often in trade rumors over the previous week, headlined this week by Giannis Antetokounmpo.",
    "fullText": "As we inch closer to the NBA trade deadline of 2026-27, bigger names are starting to pop up in rumors, including that of one former NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nToday, that player leads off our latest Trade Rumors Rankings series, in which we rank the five players who have appeared most often in trade rumors over the previous week.\n\nFour-time All-Star Trae Young hasn't played since Oct. 29, and yet the Atlanta Hawks are off to as good a start as they've had in years, sitting at 14-11.\n\nLike other enigmatic point guards, Young has heard his name mentioned in trade rumors this season, including in this report from ESPN:\n\nCharlotte's LaMelo Ball, Memphis' Ja Morant and Atlanta's Trae Young all seem to be stuck in a sort of limbo with the franchises that they've been the faces of since entering the league as high lottery picks. There is rampant speculation among rival teams that Ball, Morant and Young could all be available leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline. For a variety of reasons, from their maximum contracts to their major flaws, it's not a discussion that generates much enthusiasm despite their status as big names who have put up big numbers. \"I wouldn't want any of them,\" a Western Conference general manager told ESPN. That was a popular opinion in an informal poll of executives, scouts and coaches conducted by ESPN. There wasn't a consensus about which one of the three would command the biggest return if they ended up getting shopped in the trade market, as votes were split among Ball, Morant and Young. \"They all might have negative value,\" an Eastern Conference executive said.\n\nSpeaking of how well the Hawks are playing without Young, an anonymous source criticized Young more to ESPN:\n\nIn other words, the Hawks with Young in the lineup would rank dead last in the league in defensive efficiency. Without him, the Hawks have defended at a top-five level. \"He's just small and doesn't play any defense,\" an East scout said. That scout valued Young more than Morant and Ball, primarily because of his offensive prowess and lack of off-court concerns. Several people mentioned the long-running perception that he's unpopular with teammates as worrisome, especially considering that Young creates so many dunks and open looks with his passing prowess.\n\nThe thing is, Young has proven in the past to be up to the task of leading a team on a deep playoff run. He just has to have a great team around him. Maybe Atlanta will be fine staying put with Young at the helm once he returns, as the team does have a strong roster this season.\n\nEither way, it doesn't seem his trade value is all that high right now.\n\nFor the latest Trae Young rumors, click here.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans, owners of the worst record in the NBA at 3-22, don't have much going right for them these days, including Zion Williamson being set to miss even more time due to injury. As such, the team is naturally hearing a lot of noise as far as potential trades recently.\n\nOne player who has come up in such rumors is 25-year-old swingman Trey Murphy, who is averaging 20.5 points and 6.5 rebounds on 36.3 three-point percent shooting this season.\n\nAccording to NBA reporter Jake Fischer, the Pelicans are starting to listen to offers on the Murphy trade front:\n\nAnd there are definitely teams that believe that have told me as recently as today that New Orleans is now starting to listen and at least show some type of willingness to listen on guys like Herb Jones and Trey Murphy as well. And those guys are going to have a lot of interest around the league.\n\nThat report was negated by a Pelicans blogger, though…\n\nSharmit Dua: The Pelicans have not had any conversations with teams regarding Trey Murphy, Herb Jones, or Zion Williamson per source familiar with the matter\n\n…so it should be taken for what it’s worth.\n\nIn the NBA, players are untouchable until they aren’t, and considering how far off the Pelicans are from contention, there shouldn’t be a player on their roster who is not up for grabs on the trade market, at least anyone who isn’t a rookie.\n\nNew Orleans is certainly a team that should be kept an eye on as we get closer to the trade deadline.\n\nFor the latest Trey Murphy rumors, click here.\n\nFischer dropped another surprising nugget recently when he reported that the Miami Heat of all teams have had internal discussions about picking up Ja Morant.\n\nMiami was already shaping into a surprising buyer on this trade market even before this week's Giannis headlines. League sources say that the Heat, for example, have had internal discussions about Memphis' Ja Morant and how Miami's infrastructure could benefit him.\n\nWe’re not entirely sure how that fit would work, especially with how steady Davion Mitchell has been running point for Miami this season. With the Heat performing better than expected this year, and the team fully at peace after the departure of Jimmy Butler, going after Morant doesn’t make the most sense for Miami, in our estimation.\n\nAt the same time, there’s no denying his massive talent level. And Miami probably won’t contend this season without more truly elite talent, so who knows? Maybe this is a swing they decide to take in an attempt to hit a grand slam.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the Sacramento Kings and Minnesota Timberwolves are monitoring the Morant trade front:\n\nTeams such as Sacramento and the Minnesota Timberwolves (and likely many more) that were known to be monitoring the situation before will continue to do so, all while watching closely when Ja Morant returns (his initial timeline had him slated for a possible early December return). Still, the Grizzlies going from their loud and ugly 4-11 start to this quiet and impressive bounce-back (now 9-12) is enough to make these next few months all the more interesting in Memphis.\n\nWith so much smoke, the Morant situation in Memphis is one that has to continue to be monitored.\n\nFor the latest Ja Morant rumors, click here.\n\nSince returning from injury, former No. 1 pick Anthony Davis has shown flashes of his former prime self, enjoying 32- and 29-point performances. Overall, in his last four games, Davis is averaging 20.0 points, 11.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.8 blocks on 51.5 percent shooting.\n\nHowever, according to a recent report, teams might be hesitant to trade for Davis anyway due to cap restrictions:\n\nThe reluctance of teams to trade multiple first round picks into the future is expected to impact the trade packages for Davis and potentially even Giannis Antetokounmpo. \"What I'm telling you is that when I talk to executives and these executives are not in trade talks with the Bucks or another for a star player right now, the mood in the NBA right now is not give up four first round picks for anybody,\" said Brian Windhorst on The Hoop Collective podcast on Friday. \"Okay, maybe if Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander) came on, or Victor (Wembanyama)... Like people don't want to do that because the aprons have spooked so many teams. All these teams are worried about getting into apron trouble where they can't reset their rosters. And you get into a situation like the Celtics were in where you got to rip your team down.\"\n\nAlso making teams wary is his troubling injury history, including in this very season:\n\nBrian Windhorst: I don't know what the value of Anthony Davis. Some of the stuff that I have heard from executives talking to me about what they think Anthony Davis' trade value is… I'm not even going to say it because then I'd get aggregated and people would be jumping down my throat and I would just be repeating something somebody else said. When I have heard what people are saying Anthony Davis' trade value is right now, not because of him as a player, to be clear, not because he's diminished as a player, but because of the idea of paying an injury-prone mid-30s guy $50, $60 million dollars in the apron era is unpalatable.\n\nWe aren’t entirely sure how the Davis saga unfolds. On one hand, he doesn’t fit the team’s current time frame, especially not with Kyrie Irving set to miss so much of this season. On the other, the Mavericks are a proud franchise and winners of four of their last five, so maybe they’d rather try to compete with Davis now healthy.\n\nFor the latest Anthony Davis rumors, click here.\n\nThe most interesting storyline of this trade deadline centers in Wisconsin, as reports have indicated that Giannis Antetokounmpo has already asked out of Milwaukee in favor of joining the New York Knicks…\n\nBrian Windhorst: The Bucks called the Knicks and asked for an offer for Giannis Antetokounmpo, because Giannis said, 'I want to be a Knick.' .... Guys, Giannis has asked to be traded already. It appears Giannis committed to himself for the season to the Bucks. But the Bucks are not good. This year, when Giannis hasn't played, the Bucks are 1-5. When he has played, they're 9-8. Would his viewpoint change? I don't know.\n\n…while the Bucks have reportedly told teams that the Greek superstar is not available:\n\nAs trade season draws close, everyone is talking about Giannis. Even though — and I want to underline this — the Bucks continue to tell teams: 'He’s not available. We don’t want your trade pitches.' So, it’s this weird deal where the Bucks keep shouting into the wind: 'Listen to us! We don’t want to talk trades with you about Giannis Antetokounmpo!' And the rest of the league just ignores it and obsesses about him.\"\n\nSince the initial report from ESPN’s Brian Windhorst came out, a plethora of reporting on the matter from other sources has come to light.\n\nESPN's Shams Charania, for example, reported afterward that Antetokounmpo and his camp have started talks with Milwaukee about whether or not Antetokounmpo will stay with the Bucks long-term:\n\nJust in: Giannis Antetokounmpo and his agent Alex Saratsis have started conversations with the Milwaukee Bucks about the two-time NBA MVP's future – and discussing whether his best fit is staying or elsewhere, sources tell ESPN. A resolution is expected in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/NfrpL2Ffvr\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) December 3, 2025\n\nESPN also reported that it wouldn’t be New-York-or-bust for Antetokounmpo:\n\nOver the offseason, Antetokounmpo explored external options and was open to playing for one team outside of Milwaukee -- the New York Knicks -- as a potential trade home. Sources described it as an exclusive negotiating window for the Knicks over a multiweek period in August, but that will not be the case moving forward. Multiple other teams would be expected to emerge as suitors for the nine-time All-Star if trades are explored.\n\nDoc Rivers, frustrated with the media and reporting on the matter, then said that Antetokounmpo hadn’t asked for a trade:\n\nDoc Rivers: \"I want to make it clear for the - I want to say one more time - for the 50th time, and clearly it's not getting to one network, for sure, Giannis has never asked to be traded. Ever. I can't make that more clear.\" https://t.co/e6XSo0OuP8\n\n— Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) December 3, 2025\n\nThe Lakers, Clippers and Heat were also reportedly mentioned as other potential suitors for the former league MVP, though they were waiting until he could hit free agency in 2027.\n\nAnd all of that is just a taste of the huge amount of reporting on the Antetokounmpo trade front over the last week.
