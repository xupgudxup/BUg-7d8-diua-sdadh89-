Main Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States. At the news conference, MLB staff assembled duffel bags with goods for foster care children.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "fullText": "Carson Beck family tree: Meet sister Kylie, ex-NBA cheerleader mom and more about Florida roots originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDoes Carson Beck have a girlfriend?\n\nNot many college quarterbacks can say they had a resume the caliber of Carson Beck's.\n\nWhile both of his championships came as a backup when he played for the Georgia Bulldogs, Beck still cemented himself as a starter by 2023, when he threw for 3,941 yards and had 28 total touchdowns for Georgia. Then, Beck decided to play one last year in college, transferring to the Miami Hurricanes for a reported hefty NIL package.\n\nThose around Beck have been in the spotlight often, from his past relationship with Miami women's basketball star Hanna Cavinder, to his family, including his mom and sister.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of Beck's family tree.\n\nMORE: Why did Carson Beck transfer from Georgia to Miami?\n\nCarson Beck's sister is Kylie Beck. She is a former cheerleader and member of the dance team at Georgia, where she attended at the same time as her brother.\n\nWhen the quarterback departed Georgia for Miami, Kylie Beck, a sophomore at the time, also shared that she was leaving the Bulldogs behind. It hasn't been confirmed whether she also chose to attend Miami, but she's remained a close supporter of her brother with the Hurricanes.\n\n“Thank you letter to Athens. When one door closes, another door always opens with something greater on the other side,\" Beck wrote, per The Athlete Lifestyle on SI. \"I entered this new city hoping for greatness, success and happiness. Although there are times there was an abundance of these things, there were also times when I was at the lowest I’ve ever been and my family and I went through the hardest things we’ve ever dealt with. To say this experience has been a whirlwind of emotions would be an understatement.\n\nI am thankful that I’ve been able to call Athens my home for the past five years, traveling to games to support my brother and then making my dream a reality this past year when i was awarded the opportunity to be both a Georgette & Dance Dawg. It was such a blessing being by my brothers side and cheering him on from the field.\"\n\nLike Carson, Kylie is from Jacksonville, Florida, so the quarterback's transfer to Miami was closer to their home state.\n\nWhether as a Georgia cheerleader or just as a fan, Kylie has been a very vocal supporter of her brother's football career. She's shared plenty of social media posts about Carson.\n\nKylie Beck has also become known for her gameday outfits.\n\nKylie Beck is not a cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys. However, she was invited to dance with the Cowboys cheerleaders in March 2025, posing on the field afterward.\n\nMORE: How does NIL money work in college football?\n\nCarson Beck's mom is Tracy Beck. She grew up in Clinton, Md., went to Maryland for college and danced for the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) in the past, per The Athletic. Tracy Beck is a kindergarten teacher at Alimacani Elementary School in Jacksonville, Florida, where her kids were raised.\n\nLike the rest of Carson's family, Tracy has been a very public supporter of the quarterback's career.\n\nIn 2024, she told The Athletic that it's not \"who Carson is\" to remain in college as long as he had because of NIL.\n\n“There was no negotiating for money. That’s not who Kirby is. That’s not who this program is about, and that’s not who Carson is,” she said. “I think it’s cool he can do NIL this year and have an opportunity for all that. And those boys work so hard. I have never seen kids work as hard as they do. I mean it’s a full-time job to be a football player at the University of Georgia.\"\n\nHowever, Tracy also told The Athletic that she supports Carson's decision to buy a luxury car with his NIL money, as he's been focused on football first.\n\n“He’s so laid back and so focused on football and Georgia and his team. To him, that’s such a cool thing and be able to represent and do things for Georgia and for NIL,” she said. “But at the end of the day, talking about the car, it’s just a car. It’s very cool and amazing that he can drive something like that. But at the end of the day, it’s more about the team and coming back to try and do what they want to do this year.”\n\n\"Beck's Brigade\" is a gameday tailgate support group for Carson Beck that was started by his mother. Per Dawg Nation, Tracy Beck previously said watching Carson play always makes her nervous.\n\n“Honestly, he tells me to relax,” she said, per Dawg Nation. “I promise you that. He says ‘Don’t be nervous’ and ‘Be calm’ and ‘I’ve got this’ and ‘Tell everybody around you to not be nervous’ because it is nerve-wracking to be the quarterback’s mom and anybody’s mom.\n\n“Now some games have been close and I’ll cry at the end when we win and I’ll go out on the field.”\n\nMORE: Ranking the 19 greatest Miami players of all time\n\nCarson Beck's dad is Chris Beck. He is a former player at Navy, where he played linebacker from 1989-92, and he is now a retired Naval officer.\n\nWhen Carson Beck played for the Pablo Creek Saints, his dad was his coach, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nMORE:Carson Beck's tattoos, explained\n\nNo, Carson Beck's parents are no longer married.\n\nIt's unknown when Chris and Tracy Beck divorced, but according to EssentiallySports, the couple met in Annapolis, Maryland, before later moving to Florida and welcoming Carson in 2002, then Kylie.\n\nMORE:History of Miami QBs in the NFL, from Jim Kelly to Cam Ward\n\nAs of January 2026, Carson Beck hasn't been confirmed to be in a relationship with anyone.\n\nPreviously, he was in a high-profile relationship with Hanna Cavinder, a basketball player at Miami and popular social media influencer. Beck and Cavinder began dating in July 2024, per People, but rumors that they had split began in March 2025, not too long after Beck transferred to Miami and joined his girlfriend as a Hurricanes athlete.\n\nAt the time, per People, Cavinder had removed all signs of Beck from her Instagram profile, while her twin sister, Haley, posted on social media suggesting she had \"a gut feeling about a relationship\" and saw \"someone in my life that's hurting.\"\n\nBeck later confirmed his split with Cavinder to ESPN, saying, \"You make mistakes as a person, but it sucks that you have to go through something like that with someone that you care about, and now it's all over the Internet.\"\n\n\"Half of what you see in the media is true,\" Beck told ESPN. \"Half of what you see is not true. So, people pick their side of the story and run with it. The people that know the truth know the truth. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nMORE: When is the last time Miami won a championship in football?\n\nCarson Beck was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. He attended Mandarin High School; in 2018, he won the Florida \"Mr. Football\" award after throwing for 3,546 yards and 30 touchdowns as a junior.\n\nBeck led Mandarin to a state championship, and after initially committing to Florida as a baseball prospect, he switched to college football. Beck first committed to Alabama, then flipped his decision to Georgia and joined the Bulldogs in 2020.\n\nHas Carson Beck won a championship?",

    "fullText": "Tyler Herro gets honest about the 'young and fun' Miami Heat this season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a long while with many veterans on the team, the Miami Heat have embraced a younger squad this season. Head coach Erik Spoelstra has implemented a run-and-gun system this season, which has been quite helpful to players like Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Pelle Larsson.\n\nTyler Herro and Bam Adebayo were once the youngsters of the Heat roster, but now, they are considered the veterans. They are excited about playing for the Heat as the reliable veterans and leaders of this mostly young squad.\n\nThe current Heat rotation is filled to the brim with talented youngsters. Names like Jaquez, Larsson, and Nikola Jovic are some of the most promising players on the roster. They fit Spoelstra's new vision of working hard and playing hard at a fast pace.\n\nFor Herro and Adebayo, this can be jarring, especially since they played in a Jimmy Butler-centric system. Now that Butler is with the Golden State Warriors, Spoelstra and his system have become much more fast-paced.\n\nMore: Heat's Tyler Herro made NBA 3-point history 1 game faster than Steph Curry\n\nHerro is glad and happy to play in this current iteration of the Heat. It has been a rough season for him because he missed plenty of games with an injury. Now that he has returned, the team is ecstatic about his comeback, while he is playing with more youthful players.\n\n\"This team, we're young and fun. We got energy, being on the sideline, that’s one thing I noticed since this season started. I've seen the game through a different lens than on the court. Everyone is coachable and understanding of each other so far. It’s like everyone is for each other this year; that goes a long way,\" Herro said in response to a question about the current roster.\n\nMoving forward, the Heat have a promising future with the current squad. It will be a challenging stretch, but in the long run, they could keep developing into a better team. With a good mix of experience and youth, Spoelstra has a strong team that could be even better in the long-term future.\n\nErik Spoelstra expresses disappointment in the Miami Heat's lack of effort\n\nBam Adebayo ties second all-time for field goals made in Heat history\n\nNorman Powell continues his All-Star campaign this season 'Hopefully it happens for me'\n\nMiami's top defender Davion Mitchell seen as a huge threat to Anthony Edwards\n\nNBA trade rumors: Ranking 9 most likely stars to be traded, from Giannis Antetokounmpo to Anthony Davis",

    "fullText": "CJ McCollum reacts to being traded to Atlanta Hawks for Trae Young originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCJ McCollum’s brief tenure with the Washington Wizards has come to an end.\n\nThe veteran guard was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, along with Corey Kispert, for star guard Trae Young. The Hawks will be McCollum’s fourth team in the league following stints with the Portland Trail Blazers, New Orleans Pelicans and Wizards.\n\nMcCollum was traded from New Orleans to Washington during the 2025 NBA Draft. In all, he appeared in 35 games for Washington and posted averages of 18.8 points, 3.6 assists and 3.5 rebounds in 30.9 minutes per performance.\n\nAfter news of the trade broke, McCollum, 34, reacted to the deal by expressing gratitude for his time in D.C. and excitement about his future in Atlanta.\n\n“Loved my time in DC,” McCollum said, via NBA insider Chris Haynes. “Organization was great to my family and I. Michael Winger and Will [Dawkins] did everything they said they would and kept their word from the very beginning. Love the city and they’re doing things the right way over there.\n\n\"Exited to get to The A and get to work. Very familiar with their style of play. Love the ownership group and front office. Good group of players.”\n\nIt certainly doesn’t sound like McCollum harbors any ill will towards the Wizards organization for trading him, but if he does, he won’t have to wait too long to exact some revenge. The Hawks will host the Wizards for back-to-back games on Feb. 24 and 26.\n\nUltimately, McCollum's stay in Atlanta, like his stay in Washington, could be a short one. He's headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and there's no guarantee that he'll be back in Atlanta. But, if he proves to be a valuable addition to the Hawks this season, he'll boost his own stock in the process.",

    "fullText": "The Athletic has live coverage of Bears vs. 49ers on NFL “Sunday Night Football.”\n\nGood morning! Keep your job today. Inside:\n\nEvery moment of the past two years has felt like an inflection point for women’s basketball in America. Viewership is surging. Will they capitalize?\n\nIt kind of defeats the entire definition of an inflection point, but if there really is one, the sport has arrived at its doorstep now. Consider:\n\nThe WNBA, after a spike in popularity, is undergoing a contentious negotiation for a new collective bargaining agreement. Salaries and revenue are set to explode. The question is just how the players and league will agree to share the boom.\n\nThe sport’s rise has manifested in other ways. As recently as a couple years ago, it was standard for WNBA players — afforded meager salaries compared to those in other pro sports — to travel overseas to make big money during the offseason.\n\nEnter new leagues like Unrivaled, which opened its second season last night, and Project B, a new venture that will launch in November. While there are differences — Unrivaled is a three-on-three sport, while Project B is more akin to the full game but with a wide travel schedule — they offer similar things: more money, and player equity in the league.\n\nUnrivaled started its sophomore year with four games last night, highlighted by the Mist, an expansion franchise, winning its first game, and Rose, the defending champions, winning by 20. My favorite bit about watching these games: The league uses a modified version of the Elam Ending, in which teams play three timed quarters, but the fourth quarter is untimed. The first team to reach a certain point total (11 points more than the leading team has after three quarters) wins.\n\nI asked Ben Pickman, who wrote an excellent preview of the Unrivaled year yesterday, about whether he thinks the league has a chance to make an imprint on the larger sports world this year:\n\n“Unrivaled already excels at creating social media content that puts WNBA players fully onto viewer radars during the winter. What will be interesting is how its viewership continues to grow and whether fans become more invested in the nightly results of its games. The league’s viewership on TNT and truTV in Year 1 was comparable to the NWSL’s viewership on ESPN networks this past season, and though it is far behind the WNBA’s viewership, the two leagues are of course at varying points in their history.”\n\nBen also made an interesting point to me: With the NBA off TNT, Paige Bueckers, who plays for the Breeze, is the second-most famous athlete broadcast by TNT Sports, behind only Shohei Ohtani.\n\nThese are exciting things. Let’s move on to something a little more dour:\n\nWe discussed the looming specter of “Black Monday” yesterday — the day most NFL coaches get fired. That part came to fruition. What we didn’t expect was the firings to extend beyond the American version of football.\n\nCleveland canned Kevin Stefanski after six years in charge, which saw two playoff appearances, a disastrous trade for Deshaun Watson and a sack record all achieved amid boggling highs and lows. Jason Lloyd writes that, despite those temporary highs, Stefanski leaves behind a lot of bad things.\n\nThe Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon after three largely unsuccessful seasons. He finishes his tenure 15-36 with no playoff appearances. Tough timing after the team’s X account wished him a happy birthday Sunday.\n\nPete Carroll is officially one-and-done in Las Vegas, which feels like a sad line in what probably will be a Hall of Fame career (a convo for another day). General manager John Spytek, hired last offseason with Carroll, will remain in his role and help Tom Brady with the coaching search. What a weird year.\n\nWe’ll have to wait on movement for replacements, as plenty of those candidates are still coaching for playoff teams. One curious name to consider, though: Philip Rivers.\n\nNow, to the surprising news from across the ocean we briefly mentioned yesterday:\n\nManchester United is done with manager Ruben Amorim after a maddening 14-month tenure that began with lofty promise. Amorim’s critics viewed him as inflexible, though his tactics were successful elsewhere. Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League table last season and sits sixth right now. One thing will be missed: Amorim’s bizarre news conferences.\n\nIn other soccer sacking news, Celtic parted with Wilfried Nancy after just 33 days in charge. He joined Dec. 3 after a stint with the Columbus Crew. His early dismissal set records.\n\nWoof. Let’s move on to some more … normal news.\n\nHawks, Young working on trade\n\nAtlanta and star guard Trae Young are discussing a possible trade, a source confirmed to The Athletic, which has been a long time coming on a few different levels. Young is still just 27 and in his prime, and still possesses the ability to be an elite scorer. But it’s very clear the Hawks are a better team without him this year, and he can enter free agency after the season. Read our full story here, which includes a potential suitor.\n\nMontana State wins wild FCS title game\n\nMontana State won its first FCS championship since 1984 last night, 35-34 over Illinois State, which had become the Cinderella of the FCS tournament bracket. The game itself was unhinged, and ended after the Bobcats converted a fourth-and-10 for a touchdown in overtime on a pass from quarterback Justin Lamson to Taco Dowler (sweet name). That was merely the caboose for what transpired in the minutes before. The full recap is worth a read.\n\nSweden outlasted Czechia to win its first World Juniors gold medal since 2012 yesterday.

Given the fact that star Celtics forward Jaylen Brown has been playing at the level of a bona fide Most Valuable Player candidate so far this season and that Boston has defied the odds alongside him to claw their way up to the Eastern Conference's third-place spot, there is a very strong case that they ought to be on the hunt for some talent to add to the roster.\n\nThe frontcourt stands out in particular as an area of need, with the Celtics needing a little bit of veteran experience and a different style of big man play to put next to blossoming young big man Neemias Queta.

    "fullText": "Monday’s NBA and NHL slates present plenty of betting opportunities as teams hit midseason form and trends across both leagues turn into dependable indicators. As January rolls on, separation on the hardwood and ice sharpens betting lines, creating clearer opportunities at the window.  Here are tonight’s best bets brought to you by BetOnline.ag. All new players get a 50% welcome bonus and up to $250 in free bets.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Kings (17-14-9) wrap up a two-game home set against the Minnesota Wild (25-10-8) on Monday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nLos Angeles enters tonight’s contest riding the momentum of a 5-4 shootout win over Minnesota on Saturday, a result that stood out given the Kings’ season-long offensive struggles. Ranked 31st in goals per game, Los Angeles capitalized on its chances against a Wild team that had won eight of its previous 10 contests, with Adrian Kempe recording a two-point night to spark the breakthrough performance. While the final score reflected a wide-open game, much of the damage came from situational lapses rather than sustained offensive pressure.\n\nDespite Saturday’s nine-goal outburst, both teams continue to lean on structure and goal prevention as their foundation. The Kings rank third in the NHL in goals allowed per game (2.65), relying on disciplined defensive-zone coverage and limiting high-danger chances, a style that has pushed 22 of their 40 games (55%) below the posted total. Minnesota enters with a similar identity, excelling at controlling tempo and suppressing second-chance opportunities.\n\nExpect a sharper, more methodical approach in the rematch, with both teams tightening neutral-zone play and limiting rush chances. With goaltending and defensive structure likely to dictate the pace, this matchup sets up for a lower-scoring outcome this time around.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Clippers (12-22) close out a five-game homestand on Monday night as they host the Golden State Warriors (19-17) at Intuit Dome.\n\nLos Angeles looks to rebound after a 31-point blowout loss to Boston that snapped its six-game winning streak and dropped the Clippers back to 10 games under the .500 mark. Jaylen Brown’s 50-point outburst exposed some of Los Angeles’ season-long offensive issues, as the Clippers continue to rank near the bottom of the league in scoring efficiency. Despite the uneven record, Los Angeles’ recent surge has translated to the betting market, covering seven of its last 10 games and posting an 8–8 record against the spread when listed as underdogs of 2.5 points or more. Kawhi Leonard and James Harden will be tasked with generating efficient looks against a Golden State defense that ranks seventh in the NBA in points allowed (113.9 per game) and does a strong job limiting perimeter scoring.\n\nOn the other side, Golden State enters playing its best basketball in weeks, winning six of its last eight contests behind the continued brilliance of Stephen Curry. At 37 years old, Curry remains the engine of the Warriors’ offense, averaging 28.8 points per game, ninth-highest in the league. While Golden State’s recent success has boosted its position in the standings, it has not consistently carried over to the betting window, as the Warriors have covered just three of their last 10 games and sit 15-21 ATS on the season. As favorites of 2.5 points or more, Golden State has struggled to separate, owning a 9-14-1 ATS record in those spots.\n\nExpect Los Angeles to lean on home-court energy and create opportunities in key spots, keeping this matchup within a single possession as the final buzzer sounds.",

Braun finished with three points in 24 minutes while Gordon had 20 points in 21 minutes.\n\nBut without three-time Most Valuable Player Jokic it wasn't enough, thanks largely to the efforts of former Nugget Michael Porter Jr -- who scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in his first meeting with the Nuggets since he was traded in July.",

    "fullText": "AJ Dybantsa has lived up to his billing this season as the potential No. 1 overall selection in the 2026 NBA draft. The BYU 18-year-old freshman — originally from Brockton — is dominating college basketball defenders at the moment.\n\nEarlier in the season, Dybantsa dropped 25 points at Madison Square Garden in front of Jaylen Brown and Derrick White in attendance, and AJ has stockpiled those kinds of scoring performances as the season has gone on.\n\nBleacher Report’s Andy Bailey recently predicted that Dybantsa will indeed be the first pick in the draft, despite competition from two other guys.\n\n“Right now, there are three very real contenders to be the top pick in the 2026 draft: Cameron Boozer, Darryn Peterson and AJ Dybantsa,” Bailey wrote on January 1.\n\n“All three have been incredibly productive as freshmen. And the talent gaps between them (assuming there are any) are small enough that it might come down to which team wins the lottery.”\n\n“If someone needs a bigger forward, Boozer would be the pick,” Bailey continued. “A team in need of a dynamic lead guard could go with Peterson. But Dybantsa checks boxes that both of the others do, and wing is the easiest player archetype to build around. And if Dybantsa keeps playing through conference games the way he has in his last six appearances (when he’s averaged 27.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.3 steals), he’ll enter the summer with a ton of momentum.”\n\nPotential No. 1 pick AJ Dybantsa's last 7 games:\n\n24 PTS | 8-15 FG | 8 REB | 3 AST\n33 PTS | 11-13 FG | 10 REB | 10 AST\n35 PTS | 9-12 FG | 6 REB | 4 AST\n23 PTS | 8-14 FG | 10 REB\n26 PTS | 11-17 FG | 8 REB | 7 AST\n28 PTS | 9-17 FG | 9 REB | 6 AST\n22 PTS | 10-15 FG | 5 REB | 5 AST pic.twitter.com/2LkrcwPCqO\n\n— B/R Hoops (@brhoops) January 3, 2026\n\nDybantsa has electrified BYU basketball in his first 14 games played. The 6-foot-8 wing, a preseason AP All-American, joined the Cougars after reclassifying and committing in late 2024.\n\nEarly on in the season, Dybantsa faced challenges, including a narrow 86-84 loss to UConn where he contributed despite team struggles. But he ignited in December. His standout effort came against Clemson on December 9, engineering a 22-point comeback by scoring or assisting on 34 of BYU’s 45 second-half points in a 67-64 victory. He followed with a career-high 35 points versus Abilene Christian and made NCAA history on December 23 against Eastern Washington, posting the youngest-ever 30-point triple-double: 33 points on 11-of-13 shooting, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.\n\nEntering Big 12 play, Dybantsa earned Lute Olson National Player of the Week on December 15 and Big 12 Player of the Week on December 30. In the conference opener on January 3, he scored 24 points despite seven turnovers, leading No. 10 BYU to an 83-73 road win over Kansas State, extending their streak to 10 victories. Through early January, he’s averaging 23.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 3.8 assists on 59.1 percent shooting, positioning BYU as a Final Four contender while solidifying his NBA Draft stock.\n\nLeBron James Retirement Timeline Predicted By Andy Bailey",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJaylen Brown is on a mission for the Boston Celtics.\n\nAs the league expected the Celtics to enter the 2025-2026 NBA season with a gap-year approach, they’ve done the opposite. Brown’s contributions have been a major reason why the Celtics aren’t slipping in the Eastern Conference without Jayson Tatum.\n\nThe Celtics visited the red-hot Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night, and the momentum meant nothing to Brown. He put together a standout outing, which set NBA fans off.\n\nJaylen Brown vs Clippers:\n\n50 PTS\n6 AST\n16-26 FG\n6-10 3P\n\nJoins Tatum and Bird as the only Celtics with multiple 50-point games. pic.twitter.com/hCnOr4H0eM\n\n— StatMuse (@statmuse) January 4, 2026\n\nIn 35 minutes, Brown shot 18-26 from the field, going 60 percent from three.\n\nThe star dropped 50 points in the Celtics’ blowout win over the Clippers.\n\n@Adin_kiddactiv: MVP and they gave Brunson the POTM over him LOL.\n\n@masonfoster21: All NBA second team, all star starter!\n\n@remiaxyz: jaylen went crazy today\n\nThe points will be all of the talk surrounding Brown, but he contributed in other ways as well. The star guard generated five assists, while turning the ball over just twice. He also had three rebounds.\n\n@TruckBon: oh my gosh JB u are a demon\n\n@Wunderxotwod: LEAGUE MESSED UP\n\n@a1anthony: He is in MVP convos\n\n@Zeke_UTD: Took that player of the month seriously\n\nEarlier this week, the NBA announced the Players of the Month for December. Brown was hoping to see his name representing the Eastern Conference, but he landed an honorable mention.\n\nThe league chose Jalen Brunson of the New York Knicks, which clearly struck a nerve with Brown. Not only did he send out a direct social media reaction to the news, but he addressed it on a live stream, claiming he had the best stretch to close out 2025.\n\nSaturday’s 146-115 win was clearly a statement from Brown.\n\nHeading into Saturday’s action, Brown was averaging 29.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 50 assists per game. He is shooting 50 percent from the field and 35 percent from three this season.\n\nAfter the Celtics improved to 21-12 on Saturday, they maintain their spot as the third seed in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics will be back on the court on Monday to host the Chicago Bulls.",

    "fullText": "Orlando Magic guard Jalen Suggs has made the unusual fashion choice of wearing his headband around his neck this season. It's a nod to his \"football drip\" from high school, Suggs explains, as he was a prized quarterback who held a scholarship offer from SEC powerhouse Georgia before taking the basketball path at Gonzaga.\n\nWhether you like the headband-on-neck look or not, the NBA has taken it away. The Magic broadcast revealed Friday that Suggs has been banned from styling his headband the way he has been. It harkens back to when the NBA banned players from wearing double headbands after Tim Thomas briefly tried to popularize the trend while playing for the Milwaukee Bucks in 2002.\n\nIt's worth noting Suggs never wore the headband around his neck for the entire game. He'd play the first few minutes with it there before transferring the headband to its standard position around his forehead.\n\nKendra Douglas mentions that the league told Jalen Suggs that the headband must be on his head to begin basketball games pic.twitter.com/ap3UqPKyKf\n\n— The Magic Way (@MagicFilmRoom) January 3, 2026\n\nJalen Suggs getting the “neck headband” banned by the NBA reminds me of when Tim Thomas got the “double headband” banned in 2002 pic.twitter.com/y28I07W26R\n\n— Average Basketball Players (@avgbballplayers) January 3, 2026\n\nSuggs is averaging 15 points, 4.7 assists and 3.7 assists this season. He's an excellent perimeter defender with 1.9 steals per game. The former No. 5 overall pick has missed time with a hip contusion and knee strain, however, prompting concern considering he's only played more than 53 games once across his first four NBA seasons.\n\nOrlando will hope to have Suggs healthy and as tenacious as ever for the playoffs, though he won't have his signature look.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Is Magic star Jalen Suggs banned from wearing headband on his neck?",

    "fullText": "Bill Simmons calls out Lakers for clear struggles in December originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers had a strange run in December to close out 2025.\n\nAfter being one of the top teams in a tough Western Conference through the first few months of the season, the Lakers have hit a rough patch. The Ringer’s Bill Simmons wanted to highlight the deficits for the Lakers’ seven losses before ringing in the new year.\n\nvia @BillSimmons: The Lakers had 7 losses in December — by 17, 21. 13, 15, 24, 23 and 22 points. Happy New Year!\n\nThe Lakers finished December 2025 with a 5-7 record.\n\nAlthough the team was hopeful to find better chemistry with LeBron James back in the mix full-time after his rare absence early on, it simply hasn’t clicked yet for the Lakers.\n\nDefensively, the Lakers have been struggling all season long and they continue to trend in the wrong direction. The head coach, JJ Redick, reached a breaking point, calling out his team for its lack of execution, and the players aren’t exactly pushing back.\n\nThe seven losses occurred against the Phoenix Suns, Boston Celtics, San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Clippers, Houston Rockets, and the Detroit Pistons. Everybody listed is within the postseason picture for the time being, which isn’t a great look for a Lakers team that wants to contend for a title.\n\nThe Lakers are back on the court on Saturday night to take on the Memphis Grizzlies. They are now chasing the Houston Rockets in the standings, trailing by one game for the fifth seed.",

    "fullText": "Russell Westbrook has another place in the NBA record books.\n\nThe former MVP reached 26,711 career points on Friday, passing Oscar Robertson to become the NBA's all-time scoring leader among point guards. Robertson was previously the top scorer at the position with 26,710 points.\n\nWestbrook finished the game with 17 points on 6-of-12 shooting, 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 4 turnovers in the Sacramento Kings' 129-102 loss to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nBrodie passes The Big O 👑 \n\nCongrats to @russwest44 for becoming the NBA's all-time leading scorer for a point guard. pic.twitter.com/GOeQmKihE8\n\n— Sacramento Kings (@SacramentoKings) January 3, 2026\n\nWestbrook was already the NBA's all-time leader in triple-doubles and in rebounds among guards. He is seventh on the all-time assists leaderboard, and is on pace to pass Mark Jackson and Steve Nash for fifth by the end of the season.\n\nOf course, with the scoring record, the point guard distinction is an unofficial one. There are now 14 players ahead of Westbrook on the NBA's all-time leading scorer list and only three of them are guards: Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, James Harden. Jordan and Bryant are both quintessential shooting guards, while Harden has spent his career in more of a combo role.\n\nWestbrook has spent his post-Oklahoma City Thunder career as something of a journeyman, joining the Kings this season on a one-year, $3.6 million contract (aka the veteran minimum). He has still averaged double-digit points in every season of his career and currently ranks fourth on the Kings with 14.4 points per game, his highest output since the 2022-23 season.\n\nHe also entered Friday shooting 42.3% from the field, his worst mark since 2010, but that's partially offset by a career high 35.3% clip from 3-point range.\n\nIt was a tough night if you hate seeing less-heralded Oscar Robertson records go down, as Giannis Antetokounmpo surpassed him to become the all-time leader in 30-10-5 games.

Boston is now 21-12 on the season, maintaining their spot as the third-best team in the Eastern Conference.\n\nFollowing Thursday’s NBA slate, the Celtics are 3.5 games back of the first-place Detroit Pistons and two games back of the second-place New York Knicks.\n\nBrown added 10 rebounds and four assists to his box score versus the Kings. The MVP candidate is now averaging 29.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 5.0 assists per game in 31 games played this season.

The game was already in hand at that point. It wasn’t the most efficient game for Brown (11-25 FG), but there was no one on the Kings who could stop JB whenever he felt like driving to the cup.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Brown decided to merely put his head down and use his athleticism on a straight line to the rim; no fancy moves needed. One such example occurred at the end of the first half, when Brown used a basic between-the-legs dribble to advance past the older DeMar DeRozan for a left-handed finish.\n\nJaylen to end the half.

Sam Hauser scored 15 off the bench on an efficient 5-of-7 from 3. Anfernee Simons was similarly effective, tallying 14 off the pine (4-of-7 from distance).\n\nThe Celtics out-rebounded the Kings, 40-32. Sacramento was sharp from the line (14-15 FT) but merely room temperature from downtown (33 percent), mostly due to Russell Westbrook (2-for-9) and Dennis Schröder (3-for-8) combining for 12 long-distance bricks.\n\nNext up for the Celtics is a Saturday night showdown with the Clippers in Los Angeles. The Clips have been playing well of late and Kawhi Leonard looks rejuvenated. It’ll be a nice test for Boston.\n\nJoe Mazzulla Explains What Luka Garza Is Doing to Earn Minutes In Celtics Rotation",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are slowly slipping into mediocrity.\n\nThe franchise’s horrid defense is holding them back from greatness, as the Detroit Pistons were the latest team to give the 17-time NBA champions fits (they secured a 128-106 victory over the Lakers on Tuesday night).\n\nIn Lake Show Life’s Tyler Watts’ opinion, the Lakers’ declining superstar is also at fault for the organization’s uninspiring play, which should lead to a trade.\n\n“The Lakers have been awful with their three stars sharing the floor this season,” Watts wrote Monday. \"Luka Doncic is locked in as the centerpiece. “Los Angeles has to choose between LeBron (James) and AR (Austin Reaves) for his co-star. Both will be free agents in the offseason, and fans know what makes the most sense.”\n\n“They don’t want to trade Reaves when he’s injured, and LeBron’s value is at an all-time low. Multiple teams would still bite on King James based on the sales alone, but that is not the Laker way.”\n\n“They are known for taking care of their stars and allowing them to retire wearing the purple and gold. The Lakers should move on from LeBron, but that isn’t how they operate.”\n\n“LeBron is 41 years old and clearly declining. The Lakers have been outscored by 7.1 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor this season and have a 125.8 defensive rating. Those numbers are atrocious and resemble nothing near what a title contender puts up.”\n\nUnless James picks it up on the defensive end and shows he can play a more well-rounded brand of basketball moving forward, James will justifiably be considered a shell of his former self.\n\nAlthough a decline was bound to occur with James being the oldest player in the NBA, the 21-time All-Star shouldn’t receive a pass for his lackluster play on the hardwood.\n\nAs Watts noted, James has played well enough to generate sufficient trade interest (a deal would only work if James approved it), which would hypothetically allow the Lakers to acquire roster-bolstering contributors in a blockbuster transaction.\n\nWhether he likes it or not, James isn’t an untouchable asset in Year 23.\n\nMore NBA: Proposed Lakers trade involving LeBron James lands $110 million Warriors superstar",

    "fullText": "Christmas and the NBA have been synonymous since the league’s inception. The very first Christmas Day game was played in 1947 at Madison Square Garden between the New York Knicks and Providence Steam Rollers. The Utah Jazz themselves have been a part of this great Christmas tradition, playing eight games on the beloved holiday.\n\nJazz fans have fond memories of the six wins and probably have forgotten the two losses they’ve sustained throughout, but which is the best Jazz Christmas game? To commemorate this holiday tradition, The Lead has done its research to rank these Jazz Christmas games from worst to best.\n\nDisclaimer: there are only a select few games that have footage to go with them. Each game was ranked by the story behind it, how the game played out, and what players made the biggest impact.\n\nWhen it came to the most lackluster of the games, the Jazz vs the Phoenix Suns was the worst.\n\nThe game was played on Dec. 25, 1982, and the Jazz found themselves struggling to defend throughout the game. At one point in the third quarter, they were down by at least 20. They did manage a small comeback, but it wasn’t enough with the score being 111-101, Suns.\n\nThe only bright spots in that game were the combined effort of Jeff Wilkins, Ben Poquette, and Danny Schayes, scoring 58 of the Jazz’s 101 points. Number seven is the Jazz vs the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe seventh-place game on this list was played on Dec 25, 1977, against the Spurs (one of the last years the Jazz were in New Orleans). This game was between two 70s basketball heavyweights, Pistol Pete Maravich and George Gervin.\n\nThough the Jazz were never really close to winning, they weren’t blown out, and it was a little closer in score. Maravich led the Jazz with 27 points, four steals, and four rebounds. Gervin led the Spurs with 31 points, two blocks, five assists, and one steal. The game also gets bonus points for being the last Christmas game for the Jazz before the move to Utah.\n\nPistol Pete Maravich scored 3,667 points in 83 games over 3 years at LSU.\n\nIf you took the nation's top 83 single-game scoring performances in the last 3 years(not including this season)you'd have a combined 3,465 total points pic.twitter.com/By7PJ7WoPh\n\n— BaseballHistoryNut (@nut_history) December 4, 2025\n\nFor it being the first Christmas Day game, one would think this game would be ranked higher. However, the games to come stand out \n\nThe Jazz had a record of 11-18, though it didn’t stop them from punching above their weight. What the game lacked in story points, it earned in style points – the game was a slugfest between the two teams.\n\nThe Jazz controlled the first half of the game, then the Rockets stormed back to take the lead in the third quarter. Magic happened in the fourth, and the Jazz squeaked by to secure the two-point win over the Rockets. Any game ending with a winning shot is worth watching. Sadly, there was no found footage of the game.\n\nThe leading scorer for the Jazz was Louie Nelson with 21 points, seven rebounds, and two assists. Maravich scored 19 points and added four assists to the cause.\n\nThe fifth pick barely passed the sixth pick by being the Jazz’s first Christmas win in the twenty-first century. The year 2018 marked a new beginning for the Jazz as Gordon Hayward left for Boston and Donovan Mitchell became Utah’s new star.\n\nOn Dec 25, 2018, the league decided to give this exciting young Jazz core a chance on Santa’s big day. They were paired with a Portland Trail Blazers team, looking to prove their dominance.\n\nStyle points for this game were quite low. The first half was quite close, with Damian Lillard putting the Blazers on his back. He ended up with a stat line of 20 points, four assists, and five rebounds.\n\nOnce the Jazz got control of the game in the second half, they didn’t look back. However, player contributions were quite huge.\n\nDefensive beast Rudy Gobert had 18 points, 14 rebounds, and seven blocks. He was aided by Mitchell’s 19 points, two assists, and two rebounds. Even NBA legend Joe Ingles contributed 15 points to the Jazz’s win. Any game with Ingles deserves to be higher on the list.\n\nThis next game had both Jazz and LA Lakers greats going toe-to-toe with each other. Even though it was a blowout victory, the Jazz beating the Lakers alone makes this game legendary.\n\nThe game was a precursor to an amazing Western Conference Semifinals series between the two bruisers that same year. Magic Johnson had a good game of 18 points, 10 assists, three steals, and five rebounds.\n\nKarl Malone showed the league he was Him with 31 points, two steals, and 12 rebounds. Current Jazz color analyst Thurl Bailey added 22 points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nNot only did fans see great individual performances, but they also got to see a shoving match between Malone and Johnson. This further added to this game’s repertoire.\n\nPlayed on Christmas Day 1979, the third spot is a story full of triumph and heartbreak.\n\nThe Jazz won pretty handily against their Rocky Mountain neighbors, the Denver Nuggets. How they did it was quite phenomenal. It was a tight game through the second and third quarters. With the game on the line, the Jazz had two heroes emerge to lead them to victory.\n\nThe first player was Jazz all-timer Adrian Dantley, who came in to score 27 points and four assists. The second player to make his impact was a little-known shooting guard named Terry Furlow, who ended up scoring 37 points, five assists, and two rebounds. It was the best game of Furlow’s career.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the biggest impact he made on the league. In the waking hours of May 23, 1980, after partying, Furlow crashed into a utility pole, killing him on impact. Drugs were found in his system.\n\nLakers legend Johnson was a pallbearer at his funeral – a stark reminder of how fragile life is and how important the holidays are to see family members and friends.\n\nAt Terry Furlow’s funeral, stars like @MagicJohnson, Campy Russell, Greg Kelser, and George McGinnis were some of the pallbearers at New Jerusalem Church in Flint. See this vintage @flintjournal photo. He was truly one of the greats.\n\n— Eric Woodyard (@E_Woodyard) January 2, 2018\n\nThe second-best game was set at the height of the Jazz renaissance in the early 2020s.\n\nThe Jazz were set to face the Dallas Mavericks on Dec 25, 2021. Having their best record in years, the three-seeded Jazz were looking to show the league who they were. The Mavericks, on the other hand, were full of a young core trying to prove themselves.\n\nThe game was like two heavyweights dealing blows. The Mavericks would control the game, then the Jazz would make a run. Mitchell had a heyday even while being hampered by an injury, scoring 33 points, three assists, and three steals.\n\nKristaps Porzingis and Jalen Brunson feasted on smaller defenders, scoring a combined 54 points. It took a combined effort from Mitchell, the Flamethrower Jordan Clarkson, and the rest of the starting core to win in the fourth quarter.\n\nOut of all of the games, this was one of the most entertaining, with both teams having trouble keeping a lead. It also had great performances from individual players.\n\nIt was tough to decide between the number one and number two picks. Both were great games and featured great performances. However, number one was a better game with Jazz greats playing to their fullest. Much like pick two, the number one game was a back-and-forth conundrum.\n\nBoth the Jazz and Rockets were getting a piece of each other in the early half of the season. On Christmas Day, 1997, fans got to see a preview of an iconic playoff series. It wasn’t until the third quarter that the Jazz managed to keep a small lead.\n\nJohn Stockton robbed the world of a Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets NBA Finals.\n\nJordan, Pippen, Rodman vs. Olajuwon, Drexler, Barkley would’ve been must see TV and the Rockets owned the Bulls back then.\n\nRockets in 6 https://t.co/AEzZxM47rH pic.twitter.com/5ifMVJeO8I\n\n— V̷a̷t̷o̷r̷ (@VatorSports) May 28, 2023\n\nThe Rockets weren’t done and ended up coming back to tie the Jazz 101-101 in the fourth quarter. John Stockton took over and scored four major points to put the team ahead. Kevin Willis answered back with a tip-shot to put the Rockets within striking distance. Bryon Russell struggled off the bench but drew a foul to shoot two free throws to ice the game.\n\nStockton scored 24 points and tallied three assists, while Malone added 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Jeff Hornacek made a huge contribution as well with 20 points and nine assists.\n\nNot only did Stockton, Malone, and Hornacek outduel the likes of Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, and Willis, but it was a glimpse of a great Western Conference finals matchup, showing why this game is worthy of the number one pick.\n\nThe post What is the Best Christmas Day Game in Jazz History? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers halted a three-game losing streak with a win over the Sacramento Kings on Sunday and now look to make it two in a row when they host the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, December 30.\n\nFather Time may be undefeated, but LeBron James is still keeping him at bay. As he celebrates his 41st birthday, my Pistons vs. Lakers predictions and NBA picks anticipate another strong showing from King James.\n\nPistons vs Lakers best bet: LeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists (-115)\n\nLeBron James has played 10 games on his birthday throughout his career, averaging 32.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 6.9 assists, going for at least 35 PRA in every game played on December 30.\n\nSince his streak of double-digit scoring games was snapped on December 4, James has averaged 25.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists across eight games. He’s reached 36 PRA in five of 14 games this season, including four of his last eight.\n\nWith Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, and Rui Hachimura sidelined for the Los Angeles Lakers, James will need to take on a larger role as a scorer, rebounder, and facilitator. Tonight’s tilt with the Detroit Pistons should feature plenty of points, which means additional opportunities for James to stuff the stat sheet.\n\nJames surely understands the gravity of this moment, as he’s playing in a record-setting 23rd season and taking the court, and I expect him to make a statement tonight on his 41st birthday, showing that age is just a number.\n\nThe Lakers are 19-11 to the Over, and the Pistons are 16-15-1 O/U.\n\nLos Angeles has hit the Over in 11 of 13 home games, good for the highest percentage in the Association. The Lakers have gone Over in four of five as the home underdog. Detroit has hit the Over in two of its last three outings, including high-scoring matchups against the Utah Jazz and Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Pistons should be motivated to snap a two-game skid when they visit Crypto.com Arena tonight.\n\nDetroit most recently fell to the Los Angeles Clippers thanks to a career-high 55 points from Kawhi Leonard, and lost to the Utah Jazz on a go-ahead bucket from Keyonte George in the game before that.\n\nWith the Lakers missing several key players, the Pistons have the edge to snap the short losing streak before it gets out of hand.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham is averaging 26.5 points per game this season, and he's hit the Over on this scoring line in 15 of 29 games, including two straight. He's scored 26+ in 10 of 17 games on the road, and he's reached that mark in four of his last six outside of Little Caesars Arena.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham Over 25.5 points\n\nSpread: Pistons -2.5 (-110) | Lakers +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Pistons -140 | Lakers +120\n\nOver/Under: Over 232 (-110) | Under 232 (-110)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have hit the Game Total Over in 34 of their last 55 games (+10.90 Units / 18% ROI).

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen Jayson Tatum went down with an Achilles tendon rupture in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals last season, the Boston Celtics' NBA title defense went with him. Most expected that the Celtics' 2025-26 season would be flushed down the drain too, as Boston awaited their All-NBA forward to return.\n\nBut after 31 games this season, the Celtics are third in the Eastern Conference with a 19-12 record. It is a development that few outside of Boston's locker room saw coming, especially after the Celtics began this season 0-3.\n\nMORE: Jaylen Brown just tied Larry Bird's all-time Celtics record with insane points streak\n\nWhile Tatum has been out, Jaylen Brown has stepped up to play some of the best basketball of his career.\n\nIn year 10, Brown is averaging 29.7 points per game while shooting better than 50 percent from the floor for the first time. Not only is he a lock to make his fifth All-Star team, but Jeff Teague suspects that the quality of Brown's performances will earn him his first All-NBA nod at the end of the season.\n\nOn the Club 520 podcast, Teague argued that Brown has a better first-team All-NBA case than Luka Doncic, the NBA's leading scorer at 33.7 points per game. The former All-Star argued that Doncic is playing on a superior roster with the Los Angeles Lakers relative to who has been surrounding Brown in Boston.\n\n\"They have nothing over there (in Boston),\" Teague said. \"The Celtics were supposed to be a--, bro. I'd give it to him over Luka.\"\n\nJeff Teague says Jaylen Brown Deserves to be first team all NBA over Luka\n\n“He deserves to be 1st team not gonna lie… They have nothing over there.

    "description": "The latest 2026 NBA Championship odds and analysis, with the Oklahoma City Thunder (+135) drawing the shortest odds to win it all.",
    "fullText": "It's amazing what a 27-5 start can do for the perception of a team.\n\nThe conversation around the Oklahoma City Thunder has shifted over the past few weeks from whether OKC is the best team in the NBA to whether they may just be the best team of all time.\n\nThere's no arguing the fact that the Thunder's 14.2 net rating is the best in modern history, and the defending champs have as much skill, depth, and defensive grit as any dynastic team in recent memory. It's no wonder then that their +135 odds to win the NBA Championship are far and away the shortest in the Association.\n\nLet's dive into the latest odds as the Thunder continue to separate themselves from the rest of the pack.\n\nHere's a visual representation of how the NBA championship has odds evolved since June 2025.\n\nHighest ticket percentage\n•    Nuggets 8.8%\n•    Thunder 8.7%\n•    Mavericks 8.2%\n\nHighest handle percentage\n•    Thunder 17.9%\n•    Mavericks 16.3%\n•    Lakers 13.3%\n\nBiggest liability\n•    Mavericks \n•    Lakers\n•    Warriors\n\nWe turned to the enormous computing power of ChatGPT to find out who the large language model believes will be the last team standing this season. Not surprisingly, it stuck with the defending champs.\n\nOklahoma City has the cleanest runway to be the best team in 2026: an MVP-caliber engine in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander entering the heart of his prime, a two-way star wing in Jalen Williams, and a 7-footer in Chet Holmgren whose blend of rim protection, spacing, and feel supercharges modern schemes. That trio already drives elite half-court efficiency and a top-tier defense, and it’s backed by organizational continuity that reliably turns role players into playoff-useful pieces. By 2026, Holmgren’s strength and timing should be fully NBA-hardened, unlocking more switching and fewer help-and-recover compromises, while SGA’s mid-range and foul-drawing remain matchup-proof in May and June.\n\nDepth and optionality push the Thunder over the top. They can win big or small, play five-out without sacrificing rim protection, and toggle between pressure defense and conservative coverages depending on opponent. Crucially, they still have surplus picks and cap flexibility to plug the inevitable holes that show up in a long postseason, whether that’s a second unit scorer, another stretch big, or a specialist wing.\n\nExpect a rotation stacked with plus length, shooting, and decision-making around the core; enough to outlast the West’s heavyweights and finish the job in the Finals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Hornets coach Charles Lee is excited about Tidjane Salaun's recent development originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTidjane Salaun has not been the most popular player on the Charlotte Hornets roster since he was selected sixth overall in the 2024 NBA Draft. Considering he was chosen with such a high pick, many people expected him to be a star-level talent.\n\nUnfortunately for the Hornets and their fans, Salaun might not pan out as the star player they were expecting. However, he is working hard to become a productive contributor to Charles Lee's system with the Hornets.\n\nConsidering Salaun is only in his second NBA season, he has a lot of room to grow. He is only 20, so his development is still pending. Most players' development is not linear, so these recent performances might be a good sign for the Hornets moving forward.\n\nCoach Lee would love to see Salaun further improve because he is a big believer in the 20-year-old Frenchman. After an underwhelming rookie year, Salaun is playing fewer minutes this season, but he has been more efficient.\n\nMore: Hornets' Kon Knueppel ruled out against Magic with ankle injury\n\nThe 20-year-old is averaging 7.1 points on 51.1% from the field and 45.7% from three. Salaun has accepted his role, and he is doing his best to be as productive as possible. Coach Lee is pleased to see this because he sees solid potential with Salaun.\n\n\"He's totally embraced his role. He just realizes how much he can impact the game on both ends of the floor without just scoring, and that's what we're seeing. We're seeing more of a well-rounded game from him, where he's rebounding defensively and guarding multiple different guys,\" Lee said after winning on Friday.\n\n\"Offensively, that play where he had an opportunity to shoot an off-the-dribble step-back three, which he has in the past, and to make the one-more pass was very encouraging to see. It just shows how much he's about team, trying to compete, and do everything he can to impact winning.\"\n\nAgainst the Orlando Magic, Salaun had a superb game, posting 14 points on 6-7 shooting from the field while grabbing nine rebounds. It was an impressive performance that could lead to some consistency in the long run.\n\nAs long as Salaun is playing this way, one can expect that the Hornets will have a reliable wing moving forward.

    "fullText": "NBA insider reveals that trades are incoming in LA. Who could be on their way out? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are in absolutely putrid shape as of right now. They are 4-6 in the month of December and just got the brakes beaten off of them by the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day.\n\nFollowing the loss due to the same factors that have plagued this group for a month, JJ Redick ripped the team in their postgame press conference.\n\nMore: Lakers coach JJ Redick shreds team after Rockets loss\n\nRedick stated that there are too many players on the current roster who just don't care. If you look at the teams' performances as of late, Redick is not wrong.\n\nIf this team wants to not waste a single year of Luka Dončić's prime, changes need to be made and fast because, as presently constructed, this is not a championship-caliber roster.\n\nNBA insider Kevin O'Connor reported after the game that changes to the roster could be right on the horizon in LA.\n\nAfter the Rockets blew out the Lakers at home, Kevin O'Connor got on Twitter/X and laid out exactly what the plan is in LA after their abysmal showing through the month of December.\n\nTrades are coming in Los Angeles. Just a matter of who and when. Without them, this team has no chance of winning a title this year. That much is obvious after watching the Lakers as of late and listening to what JJ Redick said postgame.\n\n— Kevin O'Connor (@KevinOConnor) December 26, 2025\n\nThis leads you to think, if trades are incoming, who's on the way out the door?\n\nThere are many players on the roster not carrying their weight. Players that come to mind would quickly be players like Rui Hachimura, Jake LaRavia, Dalton Knecht, Maxi Kleber, and Gabe Vincent.\n\nAll of those players combined take up just north of $50 million in cap space. That is far too much money to go towards what is now essentially dead weight.\n\nWhile the Lakers don't have anywhere near the assets a team like OKC does, they are not without them completely. Between a mix of all those players' tradeable salaries and the picks the Lakers have to give, we could definitely see a move soon.\n\nDon't be shocked to see any or all of those players gone within the next month, as the Lakers have to take a real look in the mirror prior to the deadline.\n\nThe only issue for Los Angeles: teams know they're desperate, and as everyone knows, there's always going to be a Laker tax. We'll see if and how the team is able to improve its roster before the trade deadline.\n\nReport: Lakers 'circling back' on Heat's Andrew Wiggins\n\nWhat's behind the NBA's best bromance between Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves?\n\nLakers' Luka Doncic says he grew up idolizing this NBA legend\n\nLakers' LeBron James had alarming stat in Rockets loss",

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA Champion Takes Aim at Luka Doncic After Lakers' Loss vs Rockets originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers’ losing streak continued with an NBA Christmas Day slate loss against the Houston Rockets.\n\nWith an opportunity to prove they are one of the top contenders in the Western Conference on the primetime stage, the Lakers fell flat. Shortly after the game wrapped up, the outspoken former NBA veteran Kendrick Perkins offered the Lakers a piece of his mind.\n\n“Again, the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka,” Perkins wrote on social media.\n\n“He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.”\n\nAgain the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka. He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.\n\n— Kendrick Perkins (@KendrickPerkins) December 26, 2025\n\nDoncic checked in for 34 minutes of action on Thursday night. He went 9-17 from the field and attempted seven shots from the charity stripe. Doncic scored a game-high of 25 points, while coming down with five rebounds, and producing seven assists.\n\nHe also turned the ball over six times, more than any other player involved, and finished the game as a minus-25.\n\nThe Lakers were blown out with a score of 119-96. With that loss, they dropped to three straight defeats. Now, the Lakers are 19-10 on the year, slipping to fifth in the Western Conference standings. The victory for Houston allowed the Rockets to pull within half a game of the Lakers.\n\nDoncic and the Lakers aren’t in panic mode, but it’s clear that the coaching staff is growing frustrated with the team’s lack of execution, especially on the defensive end. It’s something that JJ Redick shined a light on earlier this week after the Lakers lost to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn Thursday night, Redick surely didn’t hold back. After Doncic and the Lakers get a day off on Friday, they’ll be back on the practice court for what Redick describes as an “uncomfortable” practice and film session. The Lakers will get a chance to bounce back against the struggling Sacramento Kings on Sunday.\n\nBetween the public pressure from analysts such as Perkins—and the brutally honest assessment from Redick—Doncic and the Lakers have a lot riding on them over the next couple of days. A comfortable win over the Kings could help them get back on the right track. Soon, the hoops world will see how the Lakers respond.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe future status of Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga remains one of the most fascinating in the NBA, and trade talks involving him are growing louder.\n\nBleacher Report's Eric Pincus proposed an eight-team deal that would send Kuminga elsewhere and reunite Klay Thompson with the Warriors. The full trade involves the Warriors, Jazz, Mavericks, Magic, Nets, Nuggets, Raptors and Suns.\n\nGolden State would receive Thompson, Jonathan Isaac, Day'Ron Sharpe, Garrett Temple and a Jazz 2027 first-round pick. Kuminga would head to Utah, along with Hunter Tyson (Nuggets) and Nigel Hayes-Davis (Suns). Buddy Hield, Al Horford and Trayce Jackson-Davis would also be moved from the Warriors in the deal.\n\n\"The Warriors satisfy Curry's wishes, getting Thompson to replace Hield, who has struggled to hit shots this season,\" Pincus said. \"The trio (with Draymond Green) would be on the path to close their historic runs together through the 2026-27 season, provided Green opts into the final year of his contract.\"\n\nMORE: Ben Simmons is going pro in a sport you'd never expect\n\nThompson would return to Golden State, where he spent 13 seasons before being traded to Dallas in the 2024 offseason. Kuminga, who's seen a diminished role with the Warriors this season, would get a fresh start.\n\n\"Perhaps more importantly, the team gains necessary closure on the drawn-out Jonathan Kuminga saga, which left him a restricted free agent for most of the summer and currently has the 23-year-old forward out of coach Steve Kerr's rotation.\"\n\nThe eight-team deal would be the largest trade in NBA history, passing the Houston Rockets' trade for Kevin Durant last summer.\n\nSteph's quote about Klay will bring a tear to Warriors fans\n\nJoe Mazzulla wants to get a pet wolf\n\nSteven Adams has the craziest eating habits in the NBA\n\nAnthony Edwards had an \"I'm him\" moment vs. Thunder\n\nWe finally know how Michael Jordan really feels about Scottie Pippen\n\nCooper Flagg's clutch stats are unprecedented",

    "fullText": "Anfernee Simons’ future with the Boston Celtics has been a subplot to the opening months of the 2025-26 NBA season. The score-first guard was acquired in the deal that sent Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers during the summer. Simons is in the final year of his four-year $100 million deal.\n\nIf the Celtics choose to make a move close to the Feb. 5 trade deadline, the team views Simons as a logical trade chip. After all, it is better to flip him in return for long-term assets, rather than risk losing him for nothing in the summer.\n\nHowever, if Simons does stay in Boston beyond the trade deadline, ESPN’s Tim Bontemps, speaking on a recent episode of ESPN’s ‘The Hoop Collective’ podcast, is not convinced he will have a significant role once the postseason begins.\n\n“Frankly, I don’t think Anfernee Simons is going to have a very big role in the playoffs either way,” Bontemps said. “They’re going to be playing Derrick White and Payton Pritchard a ton of minutes. He’s (Simons) not at all a good defensive player. I think he’ll be a liability in large part in the playoffs anyway.”\n\nSimons has become an important part of Boston’s bench rotation. In 29 games this season, all from the bench, he’s averaging 13 points, 2.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists, shooting 43.1% from the field and 36.9% from deep. However, according to DunksandThrees, he’s still struggling on the defensive end, ranking in the bottom 10th percentile of guards for Defensive Estimated Plus/Minus.\n\nBrad Stevens and the Celtics’ front office will likely explore potential trades as the deadline approaches. It’s fair to assume that Simons will feature in those discussions, if for no other reason than to perform some due diligence on his potential market.\n\nThe problem Boston will face is that trading Simons will leave it short on depth at the guard position. As such, if Simons is moved, multiple additional moves could follow to ensure there’s enough balance within the roster ahead of the postseason.\n\nNBA Analyst Weighs In on Jayson Tatum’s Potential Return",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Timberwolves head to the Mile High City for a Christmas night showdown with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nAfter dominating the series in recent years, the Timberwolves saw their six-game winning streak over the Nuggets snapped earlier this season.\n\nDenver will likely be without three starters, which is a big reason my Timberwolves vs. Nuggets predictions and NBA picks include a road cover on Thursday, December 25.\n\nTimberwolves vs Nuggets best bet: Timberwolves +3.5 (-110)\n\nThe Denver Nuggets knew they'd be down two starters. Neither Christian Braun (ankle) nor Aaron Gordon (hamstring) has played at all in December.\n\nGordon scored a total of 32 points in Denver's two previous wins over Minnesota this season. Braun only played in one, scoring seven.\n\nThe surprise was shooter Cameron Johnson, who went down with an apparent knee injury against Dallas in the last game. He was scheduled for a Christmas Eve MRI, but limped immediately afterward and is day-to-day for the game.\n\nThe Nuggets' depth has helped Denver flip the series against Minnesota. After losing six straight to the T-Wolves, 1-5 ATS, heading into the season, the Nuggets won and covered both games this year.\n\nHowever, with three of the six double-figure scorers potentially unavailable due to the team surrounding Nikola Jokic, that depth will be depleted in the holiday rematch.\n\nDenver is 1-2, straight up and ATS, since its six-game winning streak ended. The hot stretch was a bit of fool's gold, since it included just two winning teams and opponents with a combined .404 winning percentage.\n\nThe Nuggets have also lost to 12-19 Dallas twice in the last 10 games.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have pulled within a game and a half of Denver, riding a three-game winning streak and a 5-1 ATS run. The T-Wolves have covered their last three as underdogs, dating back to before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe game total seems high given that both teams rank in the lower half of the league in pace. Minnesota has gone Under in five straight and seven of the last nine, all against significantly lower game total cutoffs.\n\nDenver has been Under the game total in two of the last three and has played a long string of faster-paced teams, with 10 of the previous 14 games coming against teams ranked in the top half of the NBA's tempo rankings.\n\nIf Cameron Johnson doesn't play, Denver will be down an outside threat, which would seem to make it easier to team up on Jokic, but his assists actually have gone up when a shooting threat is out.\n\nJokic had 11 dimes against Minnesota in a game Johnson missed earlier this year and had 14 against Indiana when Jamal Murray was out.\n\nGuarding Jokic is a big job, and as one of the league's most-honored defenders, Rudy Gobert will take on a large portion of that job. That means paying less attention and expending less energy at the other end of the floor.\n\nGobert has scored a total of 12 points and taken a total of 10 shots in the first two games against Denver this season.\n\nSpread: Timberwolves +4.5 (-110) | Nuggets -4.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Timberwolves +155 | Nuggets -190\n\nOver/Under: Over 230.5 (-110) | Under 230.5 (-110)\n\nThe Denver Nuggets have hit the Game Total Over in 57 of their last 97 games (+13.03 Units / 12% ROI).

    "description": "The NBA's Christmas Day schedule is STACKED this year. Here's how you should prioritize watching each game.",
    "fullText": "There are few more delightful American traditions than the NBA's marquee Christmas Day slate. With no due respect to the brazen, oversaturated NFL — which has an abysmal Christmas schedule — the 25th of December will always belong to the Association and its biggest stars and best teams. It's just that much more special.\n\nWell, to be clear, Christmas with the NBA is actually special, for one.\n\nThis year, it sure seems like we're in for some Christmas barnburners. A three-time MVP takes on one of the NBA's bright, young superstars in the latest chapter of a wonderful rivalry in Denver. Two legends reunite with a holiday background in the Bay Area. Another MVP squares off against the possible future of the sport in Oklahoma City. Two star-laden teams try to see who's more worthy of the hype in Southern California. And a potential elite shotmaking battle could be in store at Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut not all of these matchups were created equal. Let's rank all five NBA Christmas games this year and determine which ones are worth at least slightly paying attention to, which ones are worth ignoring your family, and which ones you can probably ignore entirely. Note: All games will be available to watch on ESPN and ABC.\n\nIs it real hoops? Unfortunately, no.\n\nI get the intrigue of watching former longtime teammates, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, pitted against one another. I also think that a potential generational rookie like Cooper Flagg deserves the big Christmas stage. He'll make the most of it. But when we boil this game down, it features two of the Western Conference's more middling teams. It might be fun for a little while, like at the very start, but otherwise, expect some pretty forgettable basketball here. I don't think it's worth your time on a holiday.\n\nIs it real hoops? Uh ... maybe.\n\nBefore the season, the Cavaliers and Knicks looked like the clear top two teams in the East. A matchup in the Eastern Conference Finals seemed inevitable. The Knicks have held up their end of the bargain. The Cavaliers, who have already almost lost as many games this year as they did during all of last season's regular season, have not.\n\nWith that said, Donovan Mitchell and Jalen Brunson could make for some electric shotmaking in the clutch on both ends. This one is at least worth keeping on in the background at home to monitor.\n\nIs it real hoops? Yes, let's roll with it.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I think Alperen Şengün's and Kevin Durant's Rockets have a markedly higher ceiling as a legit NBA title contender. But it's hard to deny the Lakers' sheer star power, with Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves, and LeBron James. I don't think the Lakers can hang with the Rockets in a seven-game playoff series. I do, however, think they can push them in a potential Christmas classic that features so much talent on both ends of the floor.\n\nIs it real hoops? Oh goodness, YES. Absolutely, YES.\n\nWith two heated playoff meetings and seemingly countless down-to-the-wire regular-season meetings over the last three years, the Nuggets and Timberwolves have a legit case as the NBA's best active rivalry. It is, more often than not, what elite basketball should be all about. There is nothing like watching Nikola Jokić and Anthony Edwards trade shot after shot in a physical game between two squads who hate and respect each other so much at the same time.\n\nThis rivalry game concludes the NBA's Christmas Day slate this year. It will likely be the perfect dessert.\n\nIs it real hoops? Dearest readers, YES.\n\nI don't think the Thunder and Spurs have enough established history to consider them a real rivalry yet, but hoo boy, are they getting there. Victor Wembanyama has already made his displeasure with the Thunder well-known. Plus, his Spurs are one of the few teams to actually knock off juggernaut Oklahoma City so far this season. Expect a well-coached and disciplined game from both teams. Expect a few trademark, ridiculous sequences courtesy of Wembanyama, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and others.\n\nAnd expect a worthy early entry to what will likely eventually become the NBA's best rivalry down the line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Best NBA Christmas 2025 games to watch this year, ranked",

    "description": "The Grizzlies beat the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night, hanging on to the 9th spot in the Western Conference.",
    "fullText": "The Memphis Grizzlies beat the Utah Jazz, 137-128, on Tuesday night to improve to 14-16 on the season. That gave them a teeny, tiny boost in the fight for play-in positioning in the Western Conference.\n\nI guess that’s some sort of an accomplishment.\n\nFrankly, it was hard to watch this game and decide what was worse — the tanking Jazz team whose defense helped to make Santi Aldama look like a world beater (the Wizards also did this the other night, so that’s the kind of company the Jazz are in), or the Grizzlies team that was so recently considered to be on their way to perennial title contention, barely fighting for the ninth seed.\n\nIt’s not wild to imagine that if the Jazz were fielding a roster meant to win, playing only their best players on a regular basis and if Walker Kessler wasn’t recovering from shoulder surgery, they could probably give a team like the Grizzlies a run for their money for a play-in spot (is that something to be proud of?). They might even be better than this version of the Grizzlies.\n\nBut the Jazz aren’t serious about getting wins, and they’re still playing the Grizzlies pretty close (and the Jazz beat the Grizzlies in Memphis on Dec. 12).\n\nRemember when this Grizzlies team was one of the bright-future, must-watch teams of the NBA? It really wasn’t that long ago. They were the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference for two straight seasons in 2021-22 and 2022-23. That’s like yesterday in NBA years.\n\nThey were widely regarded as one of the NBA’s most fun teams to watch and then it all came crashing down. Watching the Memphis Grizzlies is a reminder of the fragility of the NBA and how the margins for error are so thin.\n\nKyle Anderson, now a Jazz man, was one of the really important supporting cast members on that Memphis team. And he, like so many others wonders where things went wrong.\n\n“Yeah, I’m with you, kind of wondering what’s going on over there,” Anderson told the Deseret News. “My opinion of it is that front office walked into something really good, and put together a really good team at first. We were rolling. Then they kind of wanted to go in their own direction and bring in young guys that kind of fit more what they wanted to do. I think that’s where they got mixed up and lost in the sauce.”\n\nAnd then so many other things happened. Most notably, Ja Morant’s off-court shenanigans. The point, though, is that every decision from every person on an NBA team has to come together in the perfect way to even get close to being able to compete for a title.\n\nIt takes so many things to go right for a team to be great. There needs to be talent, buy-in, good coaching, tenacity, freedom from distractions. And any small crack in the foundation can have catastrophic consequences. Because on NBA teams, one small crack often spreads and splinters and leads to more and more dysfunction.\n\nAnd the Grizzlies have gone through just about all of it — front office decisions changing the chemistry of the team, tensions between players and coaches, off-court behavior impacting availability of stars (time and time again), fractures in relationships, deals that have split up a once-hungry and competitive nucleus, injuries, coaching turnover, etc., etc.\n\nThere’s probably a number of teams that don’t think they are susceptible to these things happening to them, but it takes just one disgruntled star, one player being around the wrong people, one person getting bad advice, one person making a bad decision.\n\nI guess when considering all of these things, it’s the Grizzlies who were the most disappointing to watch on Tuesday night — thinking of what could have been. Instead, there was Morant, in street clothes, yet again injured, watching his team from the sideline, knowing that even if they make it to the play-in tournament, that would mean being destined for the Oklahoma City Thunder swiftly sweeping them in the first round.\n\nTonight they beat the Jazz. But that’s not much to be proud of.",

    "fullText": "Joe Mazzulla is only in his fourth season as the Boston Celtics’ head coach, but he’s already accomplished a lot. He’s led them to an NBA championship, a conference finals appearance and two 60-win seasons (and counting) since replacing Ime Udoka prior to the 2022-23 campaign.\n\nMazzulla’s tenure has been defined by winning. On Monday, he notched his 200th career regular-season win in his 275th game, becoming the third-fastest head coach in NBA history to reach that milestone behind only Steve Kerr (238) and Hall of Famer Phil Jackson (270).\n\nFor reference, both of them did so with dynasties. Jackson did it with Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls in the early 1990s, while Kerr had the mid-2010s Golden State Warriors.\n\nJoe Mazzulla won his 200th game tonight.\n\nHe reached the mark in 275 games, making him the third-fastest coach in NBA history to do so behind Steve Kerr (238 games) and Phil Jackson (270 games).\n\n— Celtics Stats (@celtics_stats) December 23, 2025\n\nMazzulla’s Celtics may not be a dynasty yet, but there’s still time to become one as long as Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are around. In the meantime, Mazzulla is proving himself as an NBA Coach of the Year candidate this season with a short-handed roster.\n\nInterestingly, Mazzulla’s 200th win was among his strangest yet. Boston got off to a slow start and trailed the lowly Indiana Pacers by as many as 20 points in the third quarter. He responded by pulling his starters, which sparked a huge comeback by the Celtics in their 103-95 victory.\n\nMazzulla’s career regular-season record now stands at 200-75–good for a .727 winning percentage. The 37-year-old will look to improve on that mark on Friday when Boston kicks off a five-game road trip against the Pacers.\n\nCeltics’ Bench Sparks Massive Comeback Vs.

González plays with a fiery intensity, fearlessness, and desire to win that reminds you what sports are all about.\n\nOn Monday, Celtics center Neemias Queta became the latest player to heap praise upon González.\n\nQueta RAVED about Hugo González this morning at shootaround: \"I knew a couple of people at Real Madrid … that's all they (raved) about, how hard he can play. I've been familiar to a little bit of the stuff that he had going on, but it's amazing to see it live.\"@CLNSMedia pic.twitter.com/ZQ9YXzCWY9\n\n— Celtics on CLNS (@CelticsCLNS) December 22, 2025\n\n“I knew a couple of people at Real Madrid … that’s all they (raved) about, how hard he can play,” Queta said on Monday. “I’ve been familiar to a little bit of the stuff that he had going on, but it’s amazing to see it live.”\n\nCeltics fans are still getting to know González and learning the teenager’s backstory to becoming a first-round pick.\n\nBorn in February 2006 in Madrid, Spain, González emerged as one of Europe’s top young talents through Real Madrid’s renowned youth system. Joining the club at age nine, he quickly rose, debuting professionally in the Liga ACB at just 16 in October 2022, becoming one of the youngest players in Real Madrid history. He excelled in junior competitions, leading Real Madrid U18 to back-to-back Adidas Next Generation Tournament titles in 2023 and 2024, earning MVP honors in the latter.\n\nQueridos Madridistas,\n\nQuiero dar las gracias a toda la entidad del Real Madrid por su cariño y trato durante estos ocho años y, no menos importante, enseñarme a jugar al baloncesto y formarme con unos valores. \n\nEsta etapa se cierra hoy y estoy muy orgulloso de haber cumplido un… pic.twitter.com/8edZSXOBHs\n\n— Hugo González Peña (@hugoglezz_) June 30, 2025\n\nOn the international stage, González contributed to Spain’s silver medals at the 2022 FIBA U17 World Cup and subsequent youth events. In February 2025, he debuted for Spain’s senior national team, scoring 11 points in a EuroBasket qualifier.\n\nSelected 28th overall by the Boston Celtics in the June 2025 NBA Draft, González participated in Summer League before making his regular-season debut. His rookie year has featured fluctuating minutes, with a first career start in October and a breakout performance on December 20, against Toronto, posting his initial double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) in a Celtics victory.\n\nGonzález, Queta, and the rest of the 17-11 Celtics will continue their season on Monday evening when they host the 6-22 Indiana Pacers at TD Garden. Boston will be going for its third-straight victory.\n\nMike Vrabel Has Hilarious Reaction To Will Campbell’s Viral Stunt At Celtics Game",

And the superstar’s recent interaction with the Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards generated a ton of buzz.\n\nIt wasn’t a long conversation, but it was enough to get the imagination going.\n\nAnthony Edwards and Giannis Antetokounmpo 👀 pic.twitter.com/Bd4rpothba\n\n— Fullcourtpass (@Fullcourtpass) December 22, 2025\n\n@rvpats1212: Cant wait til Giannis joins the Wolves and hoops alongside Anthony Edwards.\n\n@NickBuysCrypto: there was a little too much dap there\n\n@CRan3069: Over the summer, Giannis called Ant is favorite player in the league (along with  his former teammate Dame).\n\n@CaptainLeMerica: This duo would be closest duo style to Bron & D wade im shaking\n\n@DripMuse_: This would be like if dame was in his prime when he teamed up with giannis\n\nThe Timberwolves and the Bucks met for a Sunday matchup, which didn’t include Antetokounmpo.\n\nLately, the two-way superstar has been dealing with a calf strain. He’s expected to miss four to six weeks of action. Although he hasn’t been healthy enough to play, Antetokounmpo’s future in Milwaukee has remained a burning topic around the league.\n\n\"If my agent is talking to the Bucks about it, he's his own person. He can have any conversation he wants,\" Antetokounmpo told reporters last week. \"At the end of the day, I personally have not had the conversation with the Bucks. I'm still locked in, locked in on my teammates, most importantly locked in on me getting back healthy.\"\n\nDespite Antetokounmpo publicly shooting down the idea of wanting to get traded, fans remain unconvinced.\n\n@KobeBryant_jr: Hmmm Giannis to the wolves would be insane\n\n@dukethareaper1: ant and giannis as teammates would go crazy\n\nBefore going down with his latest injury, Antetokounmpo appeared in 17 games this season. He averaged 28.9 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 6.1 assists, and nearly one block per game\n\nIt was recently reported by NBA insider Chris Haynes that the Timberwolves are among a handful of teams that have expressed interest in Giannis.\n\nHowever, there hasn’t been any traction behind reports that suggest the interest is mutual. All signs have been pointing to Giannis having his eyes on the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat if he were to get traded. Contrary to the popular belief outside of Milwaukee, Antetokounmpo seems to be willing to see if the Bucks can improve their situation before he demands a move.",

    "fullText": "We are three months into the NBA season, and the two former superstars for Rutgers men’s basketball are proving why they were drafted high and are showing potential to dominate the league for years to come.\n\nAce Bailey, despite a slower start to the season, is playing his best basketball as of late. Bailey started the year by averaging 4.4 points per game in October. However, in the two months since then, Bailey has averaged 12.1 points in November and 11.5 points in December. He has already had three 20-point games and has all but three games in double-digit points in December. He has recorded several highlight-worthy shots, including the one below.\n\nBailey still has a lot of development to do to reach his maximum potential in the NBA. If his time so far is any indication, he is on an upward trajectory to reach that level. He was viewed as an all-around project when he was drafted by the Jazz. In particular, his field goal shooting percentage, defense, and rebounding still need a lot of work. Regardless, he has looked better and better with each passing game.\n\nHERE COMES ACE BAILEY ‼️\n\nTHE ROOK JUST ROCKED THE RIM IN UTAH.\n\nTap to watch: https://t.co/nnbneYnnKu pic.twitter.com/2bnTNCCWqB\n\nArguably, the more NBA-ready of the two when they declared for the draft, Dylan Harper has already demonstrated an ability to take over games, despite playing in the NBA for less than three whole months. Against Washington earlier in the month, Harper recorded 24 points and five rebounds in San Antonio’s dominating 119-94 win over the Wizards. This is not the first time this season he has recorded a similar stat line, as he has recorded games with 20 or more points and six or more rebounds two other times.\n\nHarper is averaging 48.2 percent on field goals, which is just above the average for NBA players, which has been 46.9 percent this season. However, this three-point percentage needs some work, as he is averaging 30.2 percent per game this season when the league average for three-point percentage per game is 35.8 percent.\n\nDylan Harper 24 Points, 5 Rebs, 3 Assists full highlight vs Wizards I 25-26 NBA Season pic.twitter.com/XfqF8sWvYR\n\n— Hoops Showtime (@HoopsShowtime12) December 19, 2025\n\nBoth have shown their ability to score so far in this league. Now they need to prove that they can be contributors in the other statistics. Those will likely start to click as they get more experience on an NBA court.\n\nRon Harper Jr. has spent most of his time this season on the Boston Celtics G League squad, the Maine Celtics. However, he has been called up to the main roster a few times, where he was largely used as a rotational piece due to injuries. Harper has seen action in four NBA games this season, seeing 20 minutes on the floor across all four. He has 8 points so far this season, with six of them coming in the Celtics game against the Memphis Grizzlies. He has three rebounds on the year as well, all of which came against Houston.",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Trae Young is quickly returning to his All-Star form after missing 21 games with a knee injury.\n\nNow, the Atlanta Hawks can shift their focus to healing their ailing defense.\n\nThe Hawks ranked 22nd in scoring defense before Sunday's 152-150 loss to the Chicago Bulls in the NBA's highest-scoring game this season.\n\nThe Bulls had nine scorers in double figures, led by Matas Buzelis with 28 points. The Bulls' 152 points set a season high. They also set season highs with 41 assists, 57.6% field goal percentage and 47.6% 3-point shooting (20 of 42).\n\nYoung scored a season-high 35 points with nine assists. Jalen Johnson had 36 points with 11 rebounds and nine assists.\n\nThe Hawks also had Onyeka Okongwu score 23 points and Vit Krejci add 20. Young's encouraging showing and all the offense wasn't enough to overcome the leaky defense. The Bulls set another season high by scoring 83 points in the first half.\n\n“It’s kind of tough winning games when you give up 80 points in the first half,” Johnson said. “It’s kind of embarrassing in a sense. …. Hopefully we cut down on some of the things we’re doing.”\n\nThe Hawks (15-15) have lost three straight and seven of nine to fall back to .500.\n\nYoung started for the second time in three games after missing 21 games with a right MCL sprain.\n\n“I think everybody is excited to have Trae back,” Johnson said. “He’s been out for a while. ... The fact he’s found his rhythm already in his second game is a good sign.”\n\nCoach Quin Snyder said Young may need more time before he's ready to play back-to-back games.\n\nYoung logged 26 minutes against Chicago, which he said was his limit for his second game back.\n\n“I feel amazing,” Young said. “They did their job, put me right at 26 minutes. They weren’t allowing me to do any more. ... I feel great.”\n\nYoung led the NBA in assists last season and is a four-time All-Star. He scored only eight points in 20 minutes in his first game back, a 133-126 loss at Charlotte on Thursday night. He was back in his high-scoring form against Chicago but missed a last-second jumper that would have tied the game.\n\n“Those are shots that he makes,\" Snyder said. “You feel good about getting the ball in the right guy’s hands.”\n\nSnyder said the Hawks “had a lot of breakdowns in execution” on defense in the first half. The Bulls scored 69 points in the second half and made 54.3% of their shots from the field, but Snyder said his defense “did a better job with that in the second half as far as making them work hard.”\n\nYoung said the high-scoring pace was no surprise.\n\n“It’s how both teams play,” Young said. \"Both teams play fast. Teams are coming in here and playing fast against us. We’ve got to figure out how to stop a team that can only play fast.'\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "Ranking 3 Key Golden State Warriors Trade Targets originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are expected to get active in the NBA trade market once again.\n\nAfter making a handful of notable trades during the 2024-2025 season, the Warriors are keeping an eye on several targets just months before the deadline. According to the NBA insider Chris Haynes, the Warriors have three names on their radar as they look to boost the front court.\n\n\"They are looking for size and athleticism. You look at the Warriors, rebounding and blocking shots, they're in the bottom half of the league. And points in the paint, they are dead last. So they are looking for an athletic center,\" Haynes said on NBA on Prime on Friday night.\n\nWhat the Bucks and Warriors are looking for on the trade market for @NBAonPrime. pic.twitter.com/Pl2CcXo5AV\n\n— Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) December 20, 2025\n\nDallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford was the first name to come up, and he just might be at the top of the list. The 27-year-old big man is a former second-round pick out of Arkansas.\n\nGafford is playing for his third team since entering the NBA in 2019, having previous stints with the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards. Last season, he appeared in 57 games for the Mavs, averaging 12.3 points and 6.8 rebounds. This year, he’s producing 8.5 points per game, while coming down with 6.1 rebounds and blocking 1.5 shots in 17 games.\n\nThe Mavericks are currently paying $14.3 million to Gafford. He has a $54 million extension kicking in next season.\n\nWhile he only has two playoff runs on his resume, Gafford had a meaningful postseason run in 2024 with 22 appearances, maintaining his regular-season averages.\n\nNic Claxton of the Brooklyn Nets is another reported target for Golden State. Although the Nets invested nearly $100 million in Claxton last year, they remain in a rebuilding mode. Sitting 13th in the Eastern Conference with a 7-19 record, the Nets are expected to operate as sellers ahead of the deadline.\n\nSince 2019, Claxton has been a part of three playoff runs in Brooklyn. Between 2022 and 2023, the Nets faced two first-round sweeps, limiting Claxton's chances of improving his postseason value. Despite the lack of experience, Claxton is a logical candidate.\n\nLastly, the Portland Trail Blazers center, Robert Williams, is gaining attention from the Warriors’ front office, according to Haynes. The 28-year-old former first-round pick is in year three with the Portland Trail Blazers after spending several seasons with the Boston Celtics.\n\nWilliams was a defensive standout with the Celtics before leaving for Portland in 2023. Since his exit from the Celtics, Williams has struggled to stay healthy. He underwent multiple knee surgeries over the past couple of years, limiting his production with the Blazers.\n\nThis season, Williams has appeared in 17 games for the Blazers. With an average of 15 minutes of playing time off the bench, he has produced averages of 5.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks this year.\n\nThe idea of Williams on the Warriors might seem great, but his injury history is certainly a concern.\n\nWhile Williams, Gafford, and Claxton are three names to keep an eye on in December, several other options could pop up for the Warriors as the season plays out. It’s unclear who the Warriors will end up with, but the 13-15 squad from Golden State is expected to make some important roster changes before the market closes.",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the Rams, Dodgers, UCLA and Mick Cronin, as well as the NBA Cup.",
    "fullText": "Once again, Bill Plaschke has literally jinxed another Southern California sports team with his proclamation questions regarding the Rams:\n\nWho’s going to stop the unstoppable offense?\n\nWho’s going to score on the persistent defense?\n\nWho’s going to outwit the coaching genius?\n\nI have the answers, and it's not just Seattle. It's their special teams, their defensive backs and it's coach Sean McVay's play-calling. Well, maybe the referees … but that's for another day.\n\nThanks again for the poison-pen article, Bill.\n\nJust four days after Bill Plaschke promised that the Rams would win the Super Bowl, the team blew a big lead and lost in a stinker to the Seahawks. Like my mother told me when I was a kid: Be honest, respect others, and bet against Plaschke — you'll win every time!\n\nCan we quit the Rams praise now? They can’t tackle anyone that gets past the line of scrimmage. Coach Sean McKay and defensive coordinator Chris Shula went into a shell as the Rams lost the game to the Seahawks and any chance of a long playoff run.\n\nHow many more times do we need to see Emmanuel Forbes chasing a receiver because of a blown coverage or missing an assignment and giving up a big play. The secondary is the weak link in the Rams defense and he’s absolutely a broken link. Chris Shula, please put someone else back there. The mascot Rampage would be a better choice than Forbes.\n\nBill Plaschke writes of the Rams: \"Who's going to score on the persistent defense?\" Maybe the Lions with 34 points?\n\nWilliam P. Bekkala\nWest Hollywood\n\nBill Plaschke's Rams encomium is puzzling. During the course of the game I watched, Detroit moved through the Rams defense like Sherman through Georgia. This was, at best, park football. The first team that exploits the Rams defense as the Lions did and consistently moves the ball on offense will defeat the Rams.\n\nJust when the Rams thought that they solved their kicking situation, they lost another game because of a missed field goal. After the game, they must have been kicking themselves.\n\nIt looks like the Bills are going to win the Super Bowl, because Plaschke wrote, \"The Bills? Not ever.\"\n\nThose who think what the Dodgers are doing is sound financial decision-making only have to look a little in front of their noses. The Dodgers have now committed over a billion dollars in deferred salary. What happens when that bill becomes due? They will commit another billion in the same buy-it-now, pay-it-later mode.\n\nOther teams can’t and shouldn’t follow this lead, which eventually fans pay for in higher prices for everything Dodger related. We will have their management to thank for the impending 2027 MLB labor stoppage and no baseball at that time.\n\nJust when you think that things could not possibly get any worse in Westwood, UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond adds five more years to Mick Cronin’s contract.\n\nKudos to the Knicks for apparently deciding not to hang a banner to signify their NBA Cup championship, despite not winning a title since 1973, whereas the Lakers have won 11 since that time. Hopefully new ownership of the Lakers will reverse course and take down the Lakers’ barren banner for their 2023 Cup championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "fullText": "The NBA Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder suffered just their third defeat of the season Friday, in a last-minute 112-107 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nA whopping 35 points from reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander wasn't enough to prevent the reverse -- the previously imperious Thunder's second in their past three games.\n\nAnthony Edwards top-scored for the Timberwolves, earning 26 points, plus 12 rebounds, three assists and two blocks.\n\nThe NBA champion Thunder had held the lead with 40 seconds left on the clock, before an Edwards 24-foot three-point step back jumpshot gave the Timberwolves the decisive advantage.\n\n\"It was a close game, it could have gone either way. We've played a lot of these games this season. We've won a lot of them,\" said Thunder coach Mark Daigneault.\n\n\"We had a lead going into the closing possessions, and then they just made a couple more plays than we did,\" he told reporters after.\n\nThe loss leaves the Thunder at 25-3, and comes just days after their elimination from the NBA Cup semi-final in Las Vegas by the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nOklahoma City had been on a 16-game winning streak that prompted talk of them breaking Golden State's record 73-win season.\n\nAlso on Friday, the San Antonio Spurs crushed the Atlanta Hawks 126-98, with French NBA superstar Victor Wembanyama coming off the bench to score 26 points in just 21 minutes.\n\nHis time still being managed since returning from injury, Wembanyama also managed 12 rebounds, three assists, two blocks -- and a spectacular one-handed alley-oop dunk.\n\nThe Spurs' win follows their own disappointment of defeat in the NBA Cup final in Las Vegas Tuesday by the New York Knicks.\n\nVictory takes the Spurs to third in the Western Conference, on 20-7.\n\nIt was Wembanyama's 100th game in a row making at least one block, a streak achieved only twice before in NBA history -- Dikembe Mutombo (116) and Patrick Ewing (145).\n\nThe 7ft 4in (2.24m) prodigy, 21, had missed a dozen Spurs games after suffering a left calf strain last month.\n\nThe Knicks' seven-game winning streak came to an end with a 116-107 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden.\n\nTyrese Maxey led the scoring, with 30 points, nine rebounds and two assists.\n\nThe Boston Celtics beat the Miami Heat 129-116, with Jaylen Brown reaching 30 points for a sixth consecutive game.",

    "fullText": "Anthony Edwards credits Chris Finch's ejection in the Timberwolves' win over the Thunder originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nChris Finch became the biggest story of the night early in the blockbuster matchup between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Oklahoma City Thunder with his ejection.\n\nHowever, it looks like the Timberwolves used that to fuel the flame to get the 112-107 win. That was only the Thunder's third loss of the season, putting the Timberwolves in a special group alongside the Portland Trail Blazers and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe Timberwolves have had a decent season so far, but this win over the Thunder has to be their biggest of the season. Beating the defending champions is always a big achievement, but doing it without the head coach for most of the game is impressive.\n\nFinch made sure to voice out his frustrations at the referee after a blown call early in the first quarter. By that time, the Thunder led 15-11, but the Timberwolves fed off of Finch's energy to win the game.\n\nMore: Timberwolves' Chris Finch nearly lost his mind after ejection\n\nTimberwolves star Anthony Edwards had a solid performance, getting 26 points and 12 rebounds to spearhead his team to victory. After the game, Edwards made sure to credit Finch for spurring the Timberwolves on to get the victory.\n\n\"We fed off Finchy's energy. That's all it was. Was that the first time you got thrown out, Finchy? Hell yeah,\" Edwards said in the dugout immediately after the win.\n\nReigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a strong performance of 36 points, five rebounds, and seven assists, but that was not enough to overcome the surging Timberwolves.\n\nThis could be a landmark moment for the Timberwolves' season, as they want to keep getting big wins like that. Finch's passion for his team was evident, and the players responded in kind.\n\nFor the Thunder, this is a small stumble, but it can be a bit worrying to suffer two losses in a week. They are still the NBA's best team, but these stumbles are showing some cracks. They will likely bounce back strong, but teams are starting to figure them out.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrade talks surrounding the Los Angeles Lakers are heating up, and the Lakers appear to be in pursuit of a veteran forward.\n\nAccording to Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, the Lakers are pursuing New Orleans Pelicans wing Herb Jones.\n\n“The Los Angeles Lakers are monitoring the trade market for a defensive wing upgrade, league sources told HoopsHype. Among the 3-and-D wing upgrades on their wish list is New Orleans Pelicans forward Herb Jones, league sources say.”\n\nJones is widely considered one of the NBA’s top defenders. He’s averaged 1.6 steals and 0.7 blocks during his five NBA seasons. He would give the Lakers an aggressive defender who can match up with guards at the point of attack.\n\nJones has been a key member of the Pelicans’ rotation since his rookie year in 2021. He’s averaging 10.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and shooting 40.3% from the field this season. He’s also been a reliable 3-point shooter, shooting 33.7% this season and 36.2% for his career.\n\nHe only played 20 games last season due to a posterior labrum tear in his right shoulder. He’s already matched that total this season but missed around a week in November with a calf strain.\n\nJones is set to make $13.9 million this season and signed a three-year, $67.58M extension with the Pelicans last summer. The Lakers have limited future draft picks and cap space. Their 2031 unprotected first round pick could be enticing to the Pelicans, who could look to retool their roster around their rookies.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhenever star players become available in the NBA, or even when they’re simply involved in rumors, the Los Angeles Lakers are typically linked to them.\n\nWhether it’s to drive up the price or because the Lakers have a genuine interest, we see it happen all the time.\n\nIt’s a bit crazy how often the Lakers are connected to these names, but nobody would have expected the team to trade for Luka Doncic a year ago.\n\nPerhaps Lakers fans have a point when they believe the franchise will eventually land another star.\n\nThe latest name to surface is Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. While the Bucks may not be looking to move on from Antetokounmpo, Michael Scotto of HoopsHype reported that teams like the Lakers continue to monitor the situation, even if nothing is pressing at the moment.\n\n“In fact, rival executives interested in trading for Antetokounmpo who’ve spoken with HoopsHype said they don’t believe Milwaukee wants to move him right now. With that said, it’s unlikely to keep teams such as the New York Knicks, Miami Heat, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Houston Rockets, and others from continuing to monitor Antetokounmpo’s situation to varying degrees, looking ahead,” he wrote.\n\nLanding Antetokounmpo would give the Lakers one of the best duos in the NBA for a long time, assuming he and Doncic can stay on the court when it matters most.\n\nAntetokounmpo has dealt with his fair share of injuries, but he would still be worth whatever the Lakers would have to give up.\n\nLakers' LeBron James turns back the clock with vicious dunk\n\nLakers face Luka Doncic-LeBron James crossroads after JJ Redick's latest on-court experiment\n\nLuka Doncic makes basketball history never done by Lakers point guard\n\nLakers' Luka Doncic broke all-time Anthony Davis record",

    "description": "Our Raptors vs. Bucks predictions expect Immanuel Quickley to lead Toronto to victory in Milwaukee.",
    "fullText": "The Milwaukee Bucks are a franchise on the precipice. They were struggling to support superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo when he was on the court, and without him, they’ve been downright awful.\n\nTonight, they’ll host a Toronto Raptors team dealing with its own set of injuries, but look much closer to pulling themselves out of their slump than Milwaukee does.\n\nMy Raptors vs. Bucks predictions and NBA picks break down tonight's Eastern Conference matchup.\n\nRaptors vs Bucks best bet: Immanuel Quickley Over 16.5 points (-115)\n\nNo matter what you think of this Milwaukee Bucks situation, Giannis Antetokounmpo won’t be on the court when they host the Toronto Raptors tonight.\n\nThings have been so bad for the Bucks that the Raptors are 5.5-point road favorites in this matchup, and that’s despite Toronto going through its own struggles. The Raptors have been in a slump since RJ Barrett went down with a knee injury.\n\nNow, the Raps are starting to play a little better, coming off a 106-96 win over the Heat, but that's the only time they've covered the spread in their last nine games. Still, what the Raptors have is firepower against a shaky Bucks defense.\n\nThat has me looking at the point total for Raptors guard Immanuel Quickley. IQ got off to a slow start this season, but he’s started to find his rhythm lately. He is averaging 19.1 points per game while shooting 41.2% from 3-point range over his last seven games.\n\nHe'll face a Bucks team that ranks 24th in defensive rating and ranks 21st in opponent 3-point attempts and makes per game. His point total sits at 16.5, a number he's gone Over in four of his last seven games.\n\nThe other thing the Bucks have really struggled with is cleaning the glass. They rank next-to-last in the NBA in rebounding rate, and that’s with one of the NBA’s best rebounders for half of their games.\n\nSo, without Giannis, Scottie Barnes shouldn’t face much resistance on the boards. Barnes averages 7.9 rebounds per game, and his rebounding prop sits at 8.5, a number he’s gone Over in six of his last 10 games.\n\nWhile both of these teams are struggling, the Raptors are in a better position and have more depth at the moment. They’ve had trouble covering spreads, but I think they pull out the win.\n\nImmanuel Quickley Over 16.5 points\n\nScottie Barnes Over 8.5 rebounds\n\nFor our longshot, let's bump the Raptors moneyline to them covering the spread and taking another Raps player in Jamal Shead to go Over their rebounding total.\n\nImmanuel Quickley Over 16.5 points\n\nScottie Barnes Over 8.5 rebounds\n\nMoneyline: Raptors -200 | Bucks +165\n\nOver/Under: Over 219.5 | Under 219.5\n\nThe Bucks have only covered the first-half spread in 22 of their last 60 games for a -20.70 units and a -30% ROI.

    "fullText": "MIAMI (AP) — Jake Paul proudly boasts he has become the face of boxing during the past decade. Now the YouTuber-turned-fighter is ready to embark on his riskiest ring venture yet after 13 professional fights featuring a cross section of opponents that lack the active status and talent of his next rival.\n\nPaul will fight two-time heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua on Friday night at the Kaseya Center, home of the NBA’s Miami Heat. The scheduled eight-round bout will be streamed on Netflix without the pay-per-view designation.\n\nAlthough the 36-year-old Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) has not fought since September 2024, when he was knocked out by Daniel Dubois in five rounds, he is the prohibitive favorite to derail Paul’s ambitious fight plans.\n\n“The odds are stacked against me,” Paul said Wednesday in the fighters’ final media appearance before the bout. “There are no sporting teams in history that have gone together where it’s this big of a difference in terms of skills, experience, resume, height, weight. This is going to be the biggest upset in the history of sport and you guys get to witness it.”\n\nIn their photo standoff that closed Wednesday’s event, the 6-foot-6 Joshua towered over the 6-1 Paul. Joshua also has a six-inch reach advantage, 82-76. In addition, 12 of Paul’s bouts have been at the 200-pound cruiserweight limit.\n\nThe 28-year-old Paul (12-1, 7 KOs) has built his professional record through unconventional methods. He has victories over retired UFC champions Anderson Silva and Nate Díaz and also won a convincing decision against former middleweight titleholder Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.\n\nPaul’s ability to entice 58-year-old Mike Tyson to fight him last year further enhanced the circus-like atmosphere that often define his bouts. Yet, the bout against legendary heavyweight champion, which Paul won by unanimous decision, attracted 72,300 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight also generated a reported 108 million global views.\n\nFor all the followers Paul has won through his social media platforms, he acknowledges there are detractors who view him as an insult to the sport and the fighters who have traveled the arduous trek toward contention and championship opportunities.\n\n“No one has done more for the sport of boxing in the past decade than myself,” said Paul, who also has formed his promotional company that will oversee Friday’s nine-bout card. “I think if people really cared about boxing they’d want me to win.\n\n“I see the angle that they’re coming from – that (Joshua’s) the traditional boxer, that he’s been doing it for his whole life. But I think I’m more important for the sport of boxing. If they actually cared about the sport, they’d want me to win.”\n\nJoshua, who also won an Olympic gold medal representing his native England in the 2012 Summer Games, understands his perceived role as a boxing savior against Paul.\n\n“It just seems I’ve been called in to save the purest of boxing,” Joshua said. “People don’t like the fact that I’m fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question. If we look at the people that don’t want me to be here, they want me to put an end to the Jake Paul show. That’s why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.”\n\nJoshua’s bout against Paul will be his second in the United States. And Joshua wants to leave the ring Friday with a better outcome than in his debut, when Andy Ruiz Jr. knocked him out in seven rounds to end his first heavyweight reign six years ago at Madison Square Garden.\n\n“It was a tragedy. It was a loss,” Joshua said of his first professional defeat. “But if you’re in sports, it may happen. You may take some losses but the goal is to bounce back. Through tragedy there can always be a great story. This is just part of what my life is.”\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",

    "description": "We are ranking the top rookies of the 2025 draft class with one third of the regular season complete.",
    "fullText": "Ranking NBA rookies: Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel in a race for highest mark in draft class grades originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2025 rookie class certainly hasn't disappointed. Several players have emerged as likely future All-Stars, and the depth of talent has led to players who were picked well into the second round or even undrafted that have carved out roles as solid contributors this year.\n\nTwo guys have separated themselves from the pack, and they happen to have been teammates last year. Duke alums Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel are in a neck-and-neck battle for Rookie of the Year. Knueppel took the early lead, but Flagg has closed that gap. The talent throughout the top 10 is higher than in a normal season, but those two have set the bar extremely high for the top spot.\n\nHere are the top 10 rookies through a third of the season. Grades take draft position into account.\n\nMORE: Cooper Flagg's 'clutch' stats are off the charts\n\nFlagg started the year out slowly. In retrospect, that was understandable given that he's the youngest player in his draft class and he was put on a team with point guard play so weak that he had to take on some of those responsibilities himself.\n\nAfter that initial mediocre stretch, Flagg has begun to show why scouts viewed him as a generational prospect and the surefire No.1 pick of this class. He became the youngest player to ever score 40 points in a game, breaking the record for most points by an 18-year-old that was previously held by LeBron James with his 42 against the Jazz on only 27 shots.\n\nMORE: How Mavs rookie topped LeBron in NBA's teenage scoring record books\n\nFlagg has been a two-way player, creating defensive highlights to go along with his thunderous dunks. His understanding of NBA spacing and rotations is well beyond what is normal for a typical rookie.\n\nKnueppel could easily be No. 1 on this list. His points, rebounds, and assists are very close to Flagg's. Knueppel has a bigger edge in 3-point shooting, and Flagg has contributed more impactful defense (although Knueppel is better than you might think on that end of the floor too).\n\nLet's talk about that shooting. Knueppel is going to end up as the most prolific 3-point gunner of any rookie in NBA history. He's hit a solid 40 percent of his 3's for the Hornets and maintained his scoring as the No. 1 guy on opposing scouting reports while LaMelo Ball has missed time due to an ankle injury. He's also been a very underrated driver and a good facilitator for the Hornets.\n\nOne of the first things interim head coach James Borrego did after taking over for Willie Green was to put Queen in the starting lineup.\n\nQueen has rewarded that faith. The big man looks like a truly special player in this class. Not many players can pass and score like him, and he's already shown that he is more than capable of acting as a hub for the Pelicans' offense. He became the first rookie center ever with a 30 point triple-double, dropping 33 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and four blocks against the Spurs in November, which was just one of several standout performances.\n\nThere isn't a more entertaining rookie in the paint than Fears. He came into the league with a great handle, and he finds clever ways of finishing at the rim over much bigger players. He's fast, shifty, and creative. His shaky 3-pointer from college has been at a much more solid 36 percent through the first third of his rookie season. He looks like he can be a quality lead guard going forward and has held down the starting spot in the Pelicans' lineup well.\n\nHarper came back from an early-season calf strain and didn't miss a beat. He has an uncanny knack for finishing at the rim, and his 3-pointer is starting to come around after he hit five of them in a 21-point effort during the Spurs' NBA Cup Finals loss. He has an advanced feel that has led to many saying that he plays like a veteran rather than a 19-year-old rookie.\n\nHe's saved some of his best stuff for the end of games, putting up some huge fourth quarter performances for wins while Victor Wembanyama was out. That included several clutch baskets and the eventual game-winner against the Pelicans earlier in the month.\n\nEdgecombe has been a solid all-around player for the Sixers, contributing 15.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.0 assists through his first 22 games. His elite athleticism makes it difficult for defenses to keep him out of the paint, and his defensive motor helps him defend at a high level. He has also continued to shoot 3's at a surprisingly accurate clip after knocking down just 34 percent of them in his lone year at Baylor.\n\nCoward's torrid shooting to start the season has cooled off considerably. He's still been an impact wing for the Grizzlies. He's got great size at 6-foot-6 with a 7-foot-2 wingspan, which helps make him an instant defensive plus. His motor runs very hot on the defensive end as well, where he's diving on the floor for loose balls, grabbing rebounds, and making other hustle plays. And he has still found ways to contribute on offense despite a shooting slump thanks to good cuts and finding ways to fit into the team's offense.\n\nKalkbrenner has been a monster rim protector this season, averaging 1.9 blocks per game and using every bit of his 7-foot-1 height. That has also made him one of the best finishers in the league. He's shooting an absurd 79.8 percent from the field after his first 24 games.\n\nKalkbrenner is great at the things he does well. He's a somewhat limited player though, unable to play a variety of defensive coverages and unwilling to shoot from the outside. And he turns 24 on Jan. 17, making him one of the older prospects on this list. Still, he's already established a very solid floor as a capable NBA big man.\n\nNembhard didn't play much early in the season. That was probably a mistake. He's already displaced long-time NBA veteran D'Angelo Russell as the starter in Dallas, exploding onto the national radar after a 28-point, 10-assist game against the Nuggets. The Mavericks have drastically cut down their turnovers and look like a much more organized team under the play of the rookie guard, who has proved that there is a way to survive in the NBA at just 5-foot-11.\n\nHonorable mention: Hugo Gonzalez, Sion James, Will Richard, Walter Clayton Jr., Tre Johnson, Ace Bailey, Egor Demin, Collin Murray-Boyles, Asa Newell, Will Richard, Maxime Raynaud",

    "description": "Grizzlies vs. Timberwolves predictions and NBA picks on Wednesday, December 17. Jaden McDaniels carries the load.",
    "fullText": "The Memphis Grizzlies are putting the pieces back together, winning six of their last eight, but, in a small sign of maturation, the Minnesota Timberwolves have fared well when favored.\n\nMy Grizzlies vs. Timberwolves predictions will trust one of the home team's maturing pieces, Jaden McDaniels.\n\nI dig in deeper with my NBA picks ahead of the 8 p.m. ET tip on Wednesday, December 17.\n\nGrizzlies vs Timberwolves best bet: Jaden McDaniels Over 14.5 Points (-125)\n\nWith or without Anthony Edwards in the Minnesota Timberwolves lineup — and there is reason to expect Edwards to miss his third straight game with foot soreness — believe in Jaden McDaniels’ offensive development.\n\nThe sixth-year wing has cleared this prop in four of his last six games and in 13 of 25 this season.\n\nThen realize McDaniels’ current average of 15.8 points per game is a full 3.6 points higher than his career best; his 41.8% shooting from deep is leaps and bounds better than his 33.7% two years ago and 33.0% last season; and McDaniels’ 11.9 shots per game is 1.7 more than the career high set last year and 3.2 above than just two seasons ago.\n\nEven if focusing on McDaniels’ 19 games with Edwards in the lineup — but Edwards not being “active” in Tuesday’s practice, per Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch, bodes poorly for his Wednesday availability — McDaniels would be setting career highs in points (14.0 vs. 12.2), 3-point shooting (41.8% vs. 39.8% three years ago) and shot attempts (10.9 vs. 10.2).\n\nThis is who he is now. With or without Edwards, Minnesota has proven itself right in believing McDaniels would eventually become a multi-level scorer.\n\nWithout Edwards, it should be noted that McDaniels has averaged 21.5 points in six games this year, clearing this prop in five of the six.\n\nNaz Reid has always been a scorer, but he is still undervalued in that regard. Reid has cleared this prop in 14 of 26 games this season, including five of six without Edwards in the lineup, averaging 16.7 points in those six games.\n\nEdwards is officially listed as questionable. The best way to exploit that uncertainty is to target thoughts that could cash with him in the lineup but have a greater likelihood without him. If Edwards plays, both McDaniels and Reid can still pour it in.\n\nThat happens plenty. If Edwards sits, then this same-game parlay could come down to Minnesota winning its second home game this week.\n\nJaden McDaniels Over 14.5 points\n\nBoth McDaniels and Reid spend less time in the paint when Edwards is out, thus grabbing fewer rebounds. McDaniels has averaged 4.8 rebounds this season alongside Edwards, but just 4.3 without him. Reid, meanwhile, has averaged 6.3 rebounds this season alongside Edwards but just 5.5 without him.\n\nThere is value to be found here even if Edwards plays, but it escalates if he does indeed miss a third straight game.\n\nJaden McDaniels Over 14.5 Points\n\nJaden McDaniels Under 4.5 Rebounds\n\nSpread: Grizzlies +7.5 | Timberwolves -7.5\n\nMoneyline: Grizzlies +240 | Timberwolves -300\n\nOver/Under: Over 232.5 | Under 232.5\n\nMinnesota is 16-5 outright this season when favored.

    "fullText": "Dec. 17 (UPI) -- The New York Knicks trailed by as many as 11 points before rallying past Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs to win the 2025 NBA Cup.\n\nOG Anunoby and Jalen Brunson scored 28 and 25 points, respectively, in the 124-113 victory Tuesday in Las Vegas. The Knicks outscored the Spurs 35-19 in the fourth quarter of the comeback win.\n\n\"I'm very excited,\" Brunson, who won NBA Cup MVP honors, told reporters. \"It's a goal of ours that we get to check off. It's an important stepping stone for us. We can still learn and get better from this game.\n\n\"I'm very thankful for the opportunity we presented ourselves.

Spurs players will receive $212,373 apiece for their NBA Cup run.\n\nThe Knicks went on a 7-2 run off the opening tip off. The Spurs responded with a surge of nine consecutive points to take their first lead and get back in the game. They carried a 30-28 advantage into the second quarter. The Spurs outshot the Knicks 52.2% to 48% over the first 12 minutes.\n\nThe game remained tight through the second quarter, but the Spurs held a 61-59 advantage at the break. Anunoby scored 20 points in the first half, with 10 points in each of the first two quarters. Spurs guard Devin Vassell and center Luke Kornet totaled 12 and 10 points, respectively, in the first half.\n\nThe Spurs used a 10-3 run to take an 82-71 advantage midway through the third quarter. They carried a 94-89 advantage into the final frame. The Knicks scored the first eight points of the fourth quarter as part of a 15-3 surge to take a lead they never lost. They outscored the Spurs 15-6 over the final 3:41 to secure the victory.\n\nBrunson, Anunoby and the Knicks outshot the Spurs 45.2% to 26.3% over the final 12 minutes.\n\nBrunson made 11 of 27 shots. He was just 1 of 5 from 3-point range, but also chipped in eight assists. Anunoby made 10 of 17 shots, including a 5 of 10 clip from 3-point range. Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns logged 16 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nRookie guard Dylan Harper scored 21 points off the Spurs bench. Wembanyama, who also came off the bench, totaled 18 points and six rebounds. Spurs guard Stephon Castle chipped in 15 points, 12 assists and seven rebounds.\n\n\"We've got to enjoy these moments,\" Towns said. \"You never know when you'll get another chance to do something like this and be in this environment. Life is very unpredictable. We all, in this room, don't know what tomorrow has, but I know that in the present the Knicks are the Cup champions.\n\n\"I've got a bunch of amazing brothers in the locker room that made this possible and an amazing coaching staff. We've got to celebrate this.\"\n\nThe Knicks (18-7) will take on the Indiana Pacers (6-20) in a regular season game at 7 p.m. EST Thursday in Indianapolis.

    "fullText": "Jalen Brunson didn’t have his best scoring night on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter.\n\nThe Knicks received contributions from up-and-down their bench as they pulled out a thrilling victory over the San Antonio Spurs to secure their first NBA Cup title.\n\nBrunson was named the tournament MVP, but he was sure to tip his cap to his teammates afterwards.\n\n“Without them, we don’t hold that trophy,” he said.\n\nIt starts with OG Anunoby, who led the way offensively with a game-high 28 points.\n\nAnunoby also continued his stellar all-around play on the other end of the floor, reeling in nine rebounds and earning himself Defensive Player of the Game honors.\n\n“The way he’s shooting the ball is fantastic,” Brunson said. He’s making plays and he has confidence -- when everyone is working on their game even in-season that confidence stays, so it’s a credit to him and what he’s been doing.”\n\nIt wasn’t just Anunoby, though, as big man Mitchell Robinson also stepped up with 18 outstanding minutes off the bench while Karl-Anthony Towns battled through some bruises.\n\nRobinson set an NBA Cup Final record with 10 offensive boards, and reeled in 15 in total.\n\n“That’s what Mitch does,” Towns said. “I knew playing against him just how much he impacts the game, to be his teammate now and to see what he does, he’s impacted the game how many times -- shoutout to Mitch, hell of a day at the office.”\n\nJordan Clarkson had another strong scoring night with 15 big points off the bench, but it was youngster Tyler Kolek who took advantage of the opportunity the most and truly shined on the biggest stage.\n\nKolek was leaned on heavily down the stretch and he finished with 14 points, five rebounds, five assists, and turned the ball over just once over his 20 minutes of action.\n\nIt was arguably one of his most impressive at the NBA-level.\n\n“He played big-time, I’m very happy for him,” Brunson said. “It may be a surprise to a bunch of people, but many of you see how hard this kid works and I’m just very happy for him. The way he played tonight helped us for sure, we needed him.”\n\nThe hope is that this success in big minutes can help the rest of the way in the regular season.\n\n“In a game like this where it’s basically win or go home,” the captain said. “You have guys who step up and pick up the slack for a person like me who wasn’t shooting the ball well and made a terrible second-half turnover with the back-court.\n\n“It’s when those guys come in and do that, that gives us even more confidence. That excites me more than anything, the guys who come in and do that, it gives us an opportunity to win, it’s just a great feeling.”",

He had been injured on the second drive.\n\nTowns remained on the bench after the timeout. He was clearly favoring his left leg, and trainers were giving him some attention at the end of the Knicks' bench.\n\nMitchell Robinson subbed into the game for the Knicks at center.\n\nAt the time KAT exited, the Knicks trailed 82-75.\n\nTwice in a row, Towns had gone to his patented shot fake and drive left, and on the second one, he used some physicality with his upper body to create space. But a look at a replay showed that Towns' left foot may have landed weird or twisted a bit.\n\nThe announcers on the Amazon Prime Video broadcast didn't quite figure out what had happened, but Towns was out of the game at an unfortunate time in the second half of the championship game.\n\nLeBron James usurped a clear Luka Doncic duty for the Lakers\n\nSteph Curry extends insane NBA record over Kobe, Kareem\n\nDeandre Ayton is 2nd in Lakers history in this fun stat behind Wilt Chamberlain\n\nCooper Flagg stands alone in NBA history\n\nNikola Jokic, Alperen Sengun combine to put on a show",

Murray made 14 of his 15 free-throw attempts.\n\nThe win was the Nuggets’ fifth in a row and was their first home victory since Nov. 8.\n\nThe final 1:40 of regulation had four ties and four lead changes, a stretch capped off by a free throw by Murray that tied the game with 2.3 seconds remaining after an away-from-play foul on Houston’s Amen Thompson. Denver retained possession after the free throw, but a 3-point attempt by Jokic from the top of the key was long.\n\nThe Nuggets took a 124-117 lead after a Spencer Jones 3 with 2:59 remaining in overtime, but the Rockets clawed back, getting within three with the ball and 13 seconds remaining. Alperen Sengun missed a contested 24-foot 3 with 4.9 seconds remaining, allowing Denver to hold on for the victory.\n\nSengun paced the Rockets with 33 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first triple-double of the season. Kevin Durant added 25 points, seven assists, five rebounds and five blocks for Houston, which lost its third consecutive road game.\n\nA Nuggets team that was already down two starters in Aaron Gordon (hamstring) and Christian Braun (ankle) played much of the game without starting guard Peyton Watson, who left six minutes into the first quarter after suffering a right trunk contusion.\n\nRockets: At the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday.\n\nNuggets: Host the Orlando Magic on Thursday.\n\nAP NBA: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "description": "Former NBA star Paul Pierce didn't hold back when he described the Lakers' poor decision-making in the final minutes of Sunday's win over the Suns.",
    "fullText": "Late in the third quarter of their Sunday matchup against the Phoenix Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers started to play the type of winning defense that their fans have been practically begging for. During a stretch of roughly 10 minutes that extended into the fourth quarter, they scored 24 unanswered points and forced seven turnovers, allowing them to take a 95-77 lead.\n\nHowever, after that outstanding spurt, the Lakers fell back into their old bad habits on both ends of the floor. They started to walk the ball upcourt and milk the shot clock, as if they were merely looking to conservatively protect their lead rather than build on it and hold off Phoenix. That behavior played right into Phoenix's hands, and they ended up having to pull out a 116-114 victory by the skin of their teeth after the Suns made a couple of big mistakes in the final seconds.\n\nIt was another reminder that the Lakers still have a lot of work to do in order to seriously contend for the NBA championship.\n\nHall of Famer Paul Pierce went off on them during a recent episode of the \"No Fouls Given\" podcast for the way they gave up their lead in the last several minutes of Sunday's game. He said the Lakers — and the Suns — had very poor basketball IQ in the final minutes of that contest, and that neither team will be able to win a playoff series this spring as a result.\n\n\"This was one of the lowest IQ, last four minutes I've seen from both teams this season. And based on what I saw, neither one of these teams can win a playoff series.\"\n\nOf course, the Lakers are likely not as reckless and undisciplined as they looked in the final minutes of Sunday's game, nor are they as good a defensive team as they looked during that 10-minute stretch late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter. They do have an 18-7 record, which gives them an elite winning percentage, and are in third place in the Western Conference.\n\nBut Los Angeles hasn't played the Denver Nuggets, Houston Rockets or New York Knicks yet, and when it faced the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder a month ago, it lost 121-92, albeit with LeBron James still out due to sciatica. Continuing to put forth the same ineptitude they displayed late in Sunday's game will almost certainly result in decisive losses against the Nuggets, Rockets, Knicks and especially the Thunder.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Paul Pierce on Lakers' basketball IQ in crunch time of Sunday's game",

    "fullText": "Victor Wembanyama made a triumphant return from injury to lead the San Antonio Spurs to a stunning NBA Cup semi-final upset of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday as the New York Knicks downed the Orlando Magic to book their place in the final.\n\nFrench prodigy Wembanyama, who has missed the Spurs' last 12 games after suffering a left calf strain last month, produced a dominant performance at both ends of the court to set up a thrilling 111-109 victory at Las Vegas's T-Mobile Arena.\n\nThe 7ft 4in (2.24m) 21-year-old finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in 21 minutes on court, helping the Spurs climb out of a 16-point hole in the second quarter to inflict only the second Oklahoma City defeat this season.\n\nNBA champions Oklahoma City had gone into the game on the back of a 16-game winning streak, boasting a 24-1 record for the season that had prompted talk of them breaking Golden State's record 73-win season.\n\nBut after making a smooth start to control the game, Wembanyama began to make his presence felt off the bench in the second quarter to breathe new life into the San Antonio ranks.\n\n\"I knew I had limited minutes so I had to make the most out of it,\" Wembanyama said.\n\n\"Winning against a team like this, it might seem like it's just a game but it's a collective effort and it's not an easy thing.\n\n\"It's only their second loss of the season. It means something.\"\n\nWembanyama was one of four San Antonio players to finish with double figures, with Devin Vassell scoring 23, and Stephon Castle and De'Aaron Fox adding 22 apiece.\n\n\"It says a lot. And it says a lot about where this team is going to be in the future,\" he said.\n\nReigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder scoring with 29 points, while Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren added 17 points each.\n\nIn Saturday's other semi-final, Jalen Brunson scored 40 points to power the New York Knicks to their first NBA Cup final with a 132-120 win over the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe Knicks' in-form offense proved too hot for injury-hit Orlando as New York took their recent streak to nine wins from 10 games.\n\n\"We came out here and did exactly what we said we wanted to do, which was play Knicks basketball,\" said Karl-Anthony Towns, who backed Brunson with 29 points.\n\nThe Magic had led 36-33 after making a rapid start to a breathless opening quarter -- earning the Knicks players some harsh and fiery words from coach Mike Brown in an early timeout.\n\n\"The way they came out, physicality-wise, we weren't ready for it,\" said Brunson.\n\n\"We bounced back and responded to that, and the way we played the rest of the game is a testament to that first timeout.\"\n\nNew York went on a tear at the start of the second quarter, capitalizing on a missed floating jump shot from Desmond Bane to take the lead through Josh Hart.\n\nThe Knicks briefly relinquished their advantage soon after half-time, when Bane put the Magic back ahead with a running layup.\n\nBut Orlando ultimately could not keep pace with Brunson, who late in the third quarter left opposing guard Anthony Black sitting helplessly on the floor before executing a three-point step-back jumpshot.\n\nOrlando's Jalen Suggs managed a team-high 26 points, but failed to complete the game after suffering with an apparent injury to his left side.\n\nThe Magic also felt the absence of Franz Wagner, their leading scorer this season.\n\nThe NBA Cup, a mid-season knockout tournament now in its third year, is proving a hit with audiences and players.\n\nIt now offers a tantalizing opportunity for the Knicks to win their first overall trophy since 1973.",

    "fullText": "76ers rookie named one of best NBA players under 25 years old originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne thing that the Philadelphia 76ers have been able to do relatively well over the past decade or so is infusing the roster with young talent.\n\nBack in 2017, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were both ranked highly on ESPN’s list of the top NBA players under 25 years old. Embiid ranked No. 4 on the list that year, and Simmons placed 10th.\n\nLast year, guard Tyrese Maxey came in at No. 6 on The Ringer’s iteration of the top players under 25 list. This year, it’s V.J. Edgecombe’s turn. Philadelphia’s prized rookie was recently ranked by ESPN as the 19th-best player under 25.\n\n\"While there have been some predictable rookie growing pains, Edgecombe has largely rewarded the 76ers' decision to pick him third, with his explosiveness attacking the paint and flashes of defensive playmaking that point to major long-term upside. The future of the franchise rests on Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey, and how well Philly can develop them in tandem.\"\n\nEdgecombe stepped right into a starting spot for the Sixers this season, and he’s been impressive. In 21 appearances, he’s averaging 14.7 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.3 steals per performance.\n\nWhile the raw numbers aren’t staggering, Edgecombe has shown the Sixers everything that they could have hoped to see from him at this early point in his career. He’s an elite athlete who can get to the rim almost at will and finish once there. He’s also shown an ability to space the floor, as he’s shooting 38 percent from long range and nearly 44 percent on catch-and-shoot opportunities from distance.\n\nBut, he’s been perhaps even more impressive on the defensive end where he’s shown the potential to be an elite perimeter defender. Last month, Sixers coach Nick Nurse even referred to Edgecombe as one of the best defenders on the team. He truly has All-Defensive team talent and potential.\n\nAs we've seen with the likes of Ben Simmons, being named as one of the best players under 25 isn't a guarantee that a player's potential will be realized, but it's high praise nonetheless, especially for a rookie.",

    "fullText": "Jalen Brunson's first 40-point game of the year couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nThe All-Star point guard dropped a season-high on Saturday night to lead the Knicks over the Orlando Magic and advance to the NBA Cup Championship on Tuesday night in Las Vegas.\n\nBrunson's scoring outburst came on 16-of-27 shooting (59.3 percent), despite going 2-of-5 from three-point land and only making six free throws. He also added in eight assists, four rebounds, and a steal over 39 minutes in the 132-120 win.\n\nAfter the victory, Brunson spoke with the NBA on Prime crew about his performance and how his game continues to improve, especially on the big stages.\n\n\"I think the way we've been playing, I've been able to get a couple more catch and shoots. I have a lot of confidence in my shot,\" Brunson said. \"I work way too hard not to be confident. Sometimes it's going to go in, and when it's going in I'm just going to keep firing them.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old was then asked by former two-time MVP Steve Nash about his \"touch around the rim\" and how that keeps getting better over the course of his career.\n\n\"It's something I had to learn,\" Brunson said. \"Obviously I'm not the tallest and I'm not jumping over people... My game's unique. I play off balance. I'm on balance, but most people wouldn't be. That's the stuff I work on, just be deceiving. I've done it for a long time and it keeps getting better and better like you said.\"\n\nBrunson's previous season-high in scoring was 37 points, which he's had twice this year (against the Heat on Oct. 26 and vs. the Bucks on Nov. 28). He's now averaging 28.3 points per game over 22 contests and has scored 30-plus points in four consecutive games.\n\nNew York, winners of five straight games, will need Brunson to continue playing with that confidence to keep their streak going on Tuesday night in the NBA Cup Championship against the winner of the Thunder-Spurs semifinal game.\n\n\"I work way too hard not to be confident ... my game is unique.\"\n\nJalen Brunson tells the crew about the parts of his game that keep getting better. pic.twitter.com/D83qzUnMmF\n\n— NBA on Prime (@NBAonPrime) December 14, 2025",

    "fullText": "The San Antonio Spurs are headed to the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, 132-119, on Wednesday, and might have Victor Wembanyama back in the lineup for the big tournament matchup. Following the team’s quarterfinal victory over the Lakers on Wednesday, Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson to reporters that Wemby might be ready to make his return from injury over the weekend.\n\n“Very much so,” coach Johnson said. “He had a really good day today. He had a very intense day this morning, and we’ll have to see how he responds or reacts (Thursday).”\n\nWemby went through an intense workout on Wednesday morning and then worked out again during pregame warmups before the Lakers game. He was able to get through that workout without any extra protection on his strained calf, according to Johnson.\n\nWembanyama has been sidelined with his calf strain and hasn’t played since Nov. 16. However, the Spurs have been able to get through this stretch and post a 9-3 record without their All-Star big man and defensive anchor. Wemby’s potential return couldn’t come at a better time as the Spurs will face the defending NBA Champion Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nIn Wembanyama's absence, other players like last season's Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle have had to step up even more to help carry the load. In Wednesday's win over the Lakers, Castle scored 30 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and dished 6 assists. De'Aaron Fox chipped in with 20 points, and Keldon Johnson scored 17 off the bench.\n\n“I think Victor would tell you we have a deep team, and we rely upon playing together as a team,” Johnson said. “He may be the biggest puzzle piece, but he needs everybody else to complete the puzzle.”\n\nAlthough Wemby has missed half of San Antonio’s 24 games this season, the Spurs are 17-7 overall and currently fifth in the Western Conference. When Wembanyama is on the court, he’s been as dominant as ever this season, averaging career-highs of 26.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, along with 3.6 blocks.\n\nSan Antonio and OKC square off in the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday, Dec. 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The NBA Cup championship game will be played on Dec. 16 in Las Vegas.",

    "fullText": "Any chance the Lakers had at trying to capture a second NBA Cup championship in the third season of the tournament evaporated for good in the fourth quarter against a young, fast and athletic San Antonio Spurs team missing its best player.\n\nThe Lakers won the inaugural NBA Cup title in 2023 and had designs on winning it again in 2025 and the $500,000 cash that goes to each player on the championship team.\n\nBut it was not to be — not with the Lakers unable to slow down the Spurs during a 132-119 quarterfinal loss Wednesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers got down by as much as 24 points in the fourth and made a run to get to within eight points late in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Lakers got no closer and now will face the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday.\n\nThe Spurs will meet the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in Las Vegas in the semifinals.\n\nLuka Doncic had 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists, Marcus Smart came off the bench to score 26 and LeBron James had 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. But that wasn’t enough against a Spurs team that had seven players score in double figures.\n\nStephon Castle led the Spurs with 30 points and De’Aaron Fox had 20.\n\nWhen the Lakers needed someone to lift them when they got down by 18 points in the second, someone to provide them a spark when there wasn’t one for so much of the quarter, they finally got it from the oldest player on the court, 40-year-old LeBron James.\n\nJames drove down the lane and threw down a thunderous dunk over Spurs 7-1 center Luke Kornet, bringing the Lakers to within eight points and charging up the crowd in the process.\n\nJames growled and yelled in the face of the reeling Kornet. The crowd stood and cheered, now happy that there was a Lakers’ awakening.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t hold on to that momentum, falling behind 70-58 at the half.\n\nAnd then when the third quarter started, the Lakers came out flat, giving up back-to-back threes and two more easy baskets for the Spurs to fall into an 80-60 hole early in the third.\n\nThe Lakers didn’t make it easy on themselves either.\n\nDoncic got a technical foul in the first quarter after no foul was called after Kelly Olynyk smacked him in the face and Lakers coach JJ Redick was called for a technical foul in the second quarter.\n\nWhen the Lakers last faced the Spurs a little over a month ago here, San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama played in a game L.A. won, but speedy point guard De’Aaron Fox did not.\n\nIt was the opposite this time, with Fox playing and Wembanyama out with a left calf strain.\n\nThe 7-5 Wembanyama has been out for almost a month and the super-quick Fox has been back during that time, which has changed the dynamic of the Spurs, which meant the Lakers had to shift how they played defense against San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs are more guard-oriented with Fox, Castle and Dylan Harper.\n\nThe Lakers got a taste of how much faster the Spurs are now in the first quarter, when L.A. gave up 39 points and trailed by nine after the first frame.\n\nThe Spurs show 56% from the field in the first, 50% (six-for-12) from three-point range.\n\nKeldon Johnson came off the bench to score 13 points in the first quarter for the Spurs.\n\n\"Yeah, they're running a lot of pick and rolls with Fox, a lot of pick and rolls with Castle and Harper,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said pregame about the Spurs’ new way of playing. “And all those pick and rolls lead to drives, those pick and rolls lead to kick-outs and catch two threes and then more drives. So, we've got to do a good job of containing the basketball and do a good job of contesting.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James has fresh legs and no Victor Wembanyama to worry about when his Los Angeles Lakers host the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Cup quarterfinals tonight.\n\nHere are my best Spurs vs. Lakers predictions and NBA picks for December 10.\n\nSpurs vs Lakers best bet: LeBron James Over 18.5 points (-115)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have a full battery after last playing on December 7. That break will have the aging legs of LeBron James going all out in this NBA Cup contest.\n\nA game removed from his insane 10-point streak getting snapped, James put in his best performance of the season so far (he’s only played in seven games since returning in mid-November).\n\nHe shot 12-for-17 from the floor, including 4-for-6 from 3-point range, and scored 29 points in the win over the 76eron s Sunday. LeBron was mired in a shooting funk the three games prior, going a collective 12-for-40 in those showings (30%).\n\n“Just at 40 years old, I mean, it just takes a while for my body to kind of get back into a rhythm,” James told the media about snapping his shooting skid. “And so, it felt good tonight to kind of feel like myself a little bit, being able to run and jump and cut and catch my second wind a lot faster tonight. Hopefully that stays.”\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs were hoping to have Victor Wembanyama back for this tournament tilt as he traveled with the team to L.A. However, the Spurs were quick to announce that he would not play, updating his status last night.\n\nSan Antonio desperately misses the 7-footer on both ends of the floor, but the defense has seen a notable slip without Wemby’s length causing chaos. The Spurs were the No. 6 team in advanced defensive rating before his injury in mid-November and have slid to 21st in that metric in the 11 games without him.\n\nThe interior protection has fallen off a cliff without Wembanyama’s 8-foot-4 wingspan blocking and changing shots. San Antonio allows the second fewest points in the paint per game (40) with him in action, but sees opponents’ PITP surge to 55.6 (29th) since his calf injury.\n\nJames is averaging 7.7 PITP in his first seven games since missing the start of the schedule with back issues — making up 48% of this scoring output. Against the Sixers on Sunday, LeBron upped that inside presence to 10 points in the painted area.\n\nProjections for today’s NBA Cup game have James pegged for around 17 points, but with models updating for Wembanyama’s absence, those forecasts sit closer to 20 points against the Spurs tonight.\n\nJames looks like he worked off the rust and can attack this Spurs interior without Wemby on the court.\n\nSan Antonio’s defensive chops have crumbled without their star in the middle. The Spurs have gone Over the total in five of their last six games.\n\nThe Lakers just have too much firepower for the Spurs to handle, especially on their home court.\n\nHarrison Barnes has upped his scoring in Wembanyama’s absence and scored 24 last time out against the Pelicans.\n\nHarrison Barnes Over 12.5 points\n\nSpread: Spurs +6.5 | Lakers -6.5\n\nMoneyline: Spurs +200 | Lakers -240\n\nOver/Under: Over 237.5 | Under 237.5\n\nThe Spurs are 8-4 Over/Under as a visitor this season and have topped the total in 57% of their road games going back to last season.

Bane was the story of the evening.\n\nBane dropped 37 points, making 14-of-24 shots from the floor, including 6-for-9 in a blistering showing from beyond the 3-point line.\n\nHe finished at the rim through contact and showed patience on multiple different pump fake moves beyond the arc to free himself up for shots.\n\nBane added six rebounds and five assists as he stepped up in the absence of Franz Wagner, who is out with a left leg injury.\n\nMORE: AJ Dybantsa makes basketball history only ever done by Stephen Curry\n\nAfter the game, Bane gave a simple explanation for why he had been so motivated.\n\n“I just lost $35,000,\" he told reporters. \"I gotta go get it back somehow.”\n\nBane is referencing the amount he was fined for throwing the basketball at Knicks forward OG Anunoby in the Magic's most recent game.\n\nEach advancement in the NBA Cup is worth money (more than $35,000, so Bane even has some spare change when all is said and done).\n\nThe Magic will take on the New York Knicks in the NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday in Las Vegas.

    "fullText": "A pizza chain founded by the brother of tennis star Michael Chang, and once backed by NBA superstar Kevin Durant, is seeking bankruptcy protection after years of store closures.\n\nThe parent company of Pieology filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in California, stating that its debts exceed its assets by at least double. The filing lists over 200 creditors, including many landlords and vendors.\n\nThe chain, founded in 2011, built its reputation on letting customers \"craft\" their own pizzas, calzones, and other foods. By 2022, it was boasting 130 locations in a press release announcing Shawn Thompson, a former Tim Hortons executive, as its CEO.\n\nIts website lists nearly 40 locations, mainly in California, but also in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. Thompson, whose LinkedIn page suggests his term as CEO ended last month, didn't return a request for comment.\n\nRepresentatives for Pieology, which is expected to continue operating while the bankruptcy proceeds, didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to the bankruptcy filing for Pieology's parent company, The Little Brown Box Pizza, Chang is also seeking bankruptcy protection for a company called Kustom Partner, which appears to be the administrative arm of Pieology.\n\nThe two companies filed for a form of Chapter 11 designed for small businesses that allows them to keep operating while they restructure their debts under court supervision.\n\nListed among Kustom Partner's creditors were numerous tax collectors from Florida, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii, Idaho, Georgia, Arizona, and more.\n\nIn a 2017 story about Durant's investment in Pieology, the basketball legend told ESPN that he was \"impressed with the quality\" of the pizza chain. Representatives for Durant didn't return a request for comment about the status of their investment. Pieology's bankruptcy filing said no one owns more than 10% of the company, suggesting no current institutional owners.\n\nThe Little Brown Box Pizza listed assets of between $100,000 and $500,000 compared to liabilities, or money owed, of between $1 million and $10 million.",

    "fullText": "Indiana Pacers fans don't have to wait until next season to see Tyrese Haliburton make his season debut ... as a broadcaster, that is.\n\nHaliburton will make his debut as a player contributor on \"NBA on Prime\" with an appearance on \"NBA Nightcap\" following Tuesday night's NBA Cup quarterfinals matchups — the first of five such appearances this season. On \"NBA Nightcap,\" Haliburton is expected to offer commentary on his rehab and game insights for the 2025-26 season.\n\nThe postgame analysis show is in its first season, hosted by broadcaster Taylor Rooks, featuring former NBA legends Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, Steve Nash and Udonis Haslem, discussing the evening's NBA action.\n\nWhen discussing the opportunity with The Athletic, Haliburton spoke highly of the positivity of the broadcast's coverage and its ability to reach the casual fan:\n\n\"I think just being able to talk about the game with people, and not always having to be so critical of players, but just how we can talk about the game and put today’s players in the right limelight. I think it is important.\"\n\n\"I think that our league, arguably, is one of the only leagues where people are so critical of players that sometimes it can create opinions from the casual fan that they don’t even know what they’re talking about.\"\n\n“It’s just what they’re hearing on television. I think that Prime is doing a great job of just allowing former players to come on and celebrate our game, which I think is better just overall for everybody.”\n\nLast season, Haliburton averaged 18.6 points, 9.2 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game. His late-game heroics in the playoffs helped lead the Pacers to beat the Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers and the New York Knicks to advance to their first NBA Finals appearance since 2000.\n\nThis year, the Pacers have struggled to fill Haliburton's void as a scorer and playmaker. The Pacers are 6-18, currently 14th in the Eastern Conference, while ranking 29th in points per game and last in field goal percentage. Last season, they were seventh and third in those categories, respectively.\n\nPascal Siakam is the team's leading scorer this season, averaging 24.5 points, 7 rebounds and 4.1 assists. Fourth-year guard Bennedict Mathurin is also having a career campaign, averaging 21.5 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game.\n\nThe Pacers have struggled to create assists without their leading playmaker, giving Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell expanded playmaking roles. The Pacers are last in assists, averaging 23.5 per game. Last season, they were third in assists per game, averaging 29.2 per game.\n\nInjuries have also taken a toll on this team, with Mathurin, Nembhard and Obi Toppin all missing a significant portion of the early season. The Pacers are currently on a two-game winning streak and play the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.",

    "description": "Bet on Scottie Barnes from beyond the arc in our Knicks vs. Raptors picks, odds & expert predictions for the NBA Cup Quarterfinals on Tuesday, December 9.",
    "fullText": "The Toronto Raptors were roaring when they earned one of the top seeds in the NBA Cup, but then RJ Barrett got hurt, and suddenly the Raptors looked toothless.\n\nBut they’ll need to find some bite from beyond the arc if they want to move on to the semifinals against a New York Knicks team that’s playing some great basketball.\n\nMy Knicks vs. Raptors predictions break down this NBA Cup quarterfinals matchup with my best NBA picks.\n\nKnicks vs Raptors best bet: Scottie Barnes Over 1.5 threes (+140)\n\nIt’s pretty clear at this point what RJ Barrett has meant to the Toronto Raptors this season.\n\nToronto was in a groove with a 12-5 record before Barrett hurt his knee in a November 23 meeting with the Brooklyn Nets. Since them, the Raptors are just 3-5 straight up and 1-7 against the spread, including 1-5 SU and 0-6 ATS in their last six overall.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Knicks are starting to play their best basketball of the season. They are 7-1 SU/ATS in their last eight overall, which includes a 116-94 win over the Raps at Madison Square Garden back on November 30.\n\nHowever, the Knicks are an interesting team. They basically live and die by the three-ball. New York attempts the sixth-most threes per game with the fifth-highest shooting percentage while at the same time allowing opponents to take the fourth-most threes per game and ranking 19th in opponent three-point shooting percentage.\n\nNow, with the way these teams are trending, I lean toward the Knicks covering this spread, but one of the Raptors' strengths is defending the perimeter (third-best opponent three-point shooting perentage), and are a better team at home, so I hesitate a little there.\n\nBut someone without hesitation for the Raptors this season is Scottie Barnes. The former Rookie of the Year is having a great season, averaging 20 points, 8.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game. He is also shooting the ball better than ever before, draining a career-high 39.8% of his threes.\n\nHe’s shooting 40% from beyond the arc over his last five games, hitting two or more three times. That includes going 4-for-7 from deep in that November 30 meeting against the Knicks.\n\nThe Raptors know if they want to pull off the upset in this NBA Cup quarterfinal, they’ll have to hit some threes, so there is a ton of value for Barnes to nail a few more on Tuesday night.\n\nWhile it didn’t quite make best bet status, I’ll happily add Knicks -4.5 to this SGP. Not only does it not create the negative correlation we love for these SGPs, but New York is just playing very well right now.\n\nThe Knicks have won seven of their last eight games with a net rating that only trails the Oklahoma City Thunder during that stretch. With the Raptors still struggling to find consistency without RJ Barrett, it’s hard to back them when it comes to covering this number in this spot.\n\nAnd it’s the Raptors' offense that has really struggled in Barrett’s absence. They rank next-to-last in offensive rating since Barrett got hurt, and the Under is 6-3 in those nine games without him. That includes the most recent matchup with the Knicks.\n\nOG Anunoby returns to Toronto with a bang. In his second game back from injury he went 5-for-7 from three and you know he's comfortable in Scotiabank Arena.\n\nSpread: Knicks -4.5 | Raptors +4.5\n\nMoneyline: Knicks -190 | Raptors +165\n\nOver/Under: Over 226.5 | Under 226.5\n\nThe Raptors are 0-7 against the spread in their last seven games in a row. All without RJ Barrett, who will be out once again Tuesday night.

    "fullText": "As we inch closer to the NBA trade deadline of 2026-27, bigger names are starting to pop up in rumors, including that of one former NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nToday, that player leads off our latest Trade Rumors Rankings series, in which we rank the five players who have appeared most often in trade rumors over the previous week.\n\nFour-time All-Star Trae Young hasn't played since Oct. 29, and yet the Atlanta Hawks are off to as good a start as they've had in years, sitting at 14-11.\n\nLike other enigmatic point guards, Young has heard his name mentioned in trade rumors this season, including in this report from ESPN:\n\nCharlotte's LaMelo Ball, Memphis' Ja Morant and Atlanta's Trae Young all seem to be stuck in a sort of limbo with the franchises that they've been the faces of since entering the league as high lottery picks. There is rampant speculation among rival teams that Ball, Morant and Young could all be available leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline. For a variety of reasons, from their maximum contracts to their major flaws, it's not a discussion that generates much enthusiasm despite their status as big names who have put up big numbers. \"I wouldn't want any of them,\" a Western Conference general manager told ESPN. That was a popular opinion in an informal poll of executives, scouts and coaches conducted by ESPN. There wasn't a consensus about which one of the three would command the biggest return if they ended up getting shopped in the trade market, as votes were split among Ball, Morant and Young. \"They all might have negative value,\" an Eastern Conference executive said.\n\nSpeaking of how well the Hawks are playing without Young, an anonymous source criticized Young more to ESPN:\n\nIn other words, the Hawks with Young in the lineup would rank dead last in the league in defensive efficiency. Without him, the Hawks have defended at a top-five level. \"He's just small and doesn't play any defense,\" an East scout said. That scout valued Young more than Morant and Ball, primarily because of his offensive prowess and lack of off-court concerns. Several people mentioned the long-running perception that he's unpopular with teammates as worrisome, especially considering that Young creates so many dunks and open looks with his passing prowess.\n\nThe thing is, Young has proven in the past to be up to the task of leading a team on a deep playoff run. He just has to have a great team around him. Maybe Atlanta will be fine staying put with Young at the helm once he returns, as the team does have a strong roster this season.\n\nEither way, it doesn't seem his trade value is all that high right now.\n\nFor the latest Trae Young rumors, click here.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans, owners of the worst record in the NBA at 3-22, don't have much going right for them these days, including Zion Williamson being set to miss even more time due to injury. As such, the team is naturally hearing a lot of noise as far as potential trades recently.\n\nOne player who has come up in such rumors is 25-year-old swingman Trey Murphy, who is averaging 20.5 points and 6.5 rebounds on 36.3 three-point percent shooting this season.\n\nAccording to NBA reporter Jake Fischer, the Pelicans are starting to listen to offers on the Murphy trade front:\n\nAnd there are definitely teams that believe that have told me as recently as today that New Orleans is now starting to listen and at least show some type of willingness to listen on guys like Herb Jones and Trey Murphy as well. And those guys are going to have a lot of interest around the league.\n\nThat report was negated by a Pelicans blogger, though…\n\nSharmit Dua: The Pelicans have not had any conversations with teams regarding Trey Murphy, Herb Jones, or Zion Williamson per source familiar with the matter\n\n…so it should be taken for what it’s worth.\n\nIn the NBA, players are untouchable until they aren’t, and considering how far off the Pelicans are from contention, there shouldn’t be a player on their roster who is not up for grabs on the trade market, at least anyone who isn’t a rookie.\n\nNew Orleans is certainly a team that should be kept an eye on as we get closer to the trade deadline.\n\nFor the latest Trey Murphy rumors, click here.\n\nFischer dropped another surprising nugget recently when he reported that the Miami Heat of all teams have had internal discussions about picking up Ja Morant.\n\nMiami was already shaping into a surprising buyer on this trade market even before this week's Giannis headlines. League sources say that the Heat, for example, have had internal discussions about Memphis' Ja Morant and how Miami's infrastructure could benefit him.\n\nWe’re not entirely sure how that fit would work, especially with how steady Davion Mitchell has been running point for Miami this season. With the Heat performing better than expected this year, and the team fully at peace after the departure of Jimmy Butler, going after Morant doesn’t make the most sense for Miami, in our estimation.\n\nAt the same time, there’s no denying his massive talent level. And Miami probably won’t contend this season without more truly elite talent, so who knows? Maybe this is a swing they decide to take in an attempt to hit a grand slam.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the Sacramento Kings and Minnesota Timberwolves are monitoring the Morant trade front:\n\nTeams such as Sacramento and the Minnesota Timberwolves (and likely many more) that were known to be monitoring the situation before will continue to do so, all while watching closely when Ja Morant returns (his initial timeline had him slated for a possible early December return). Still, the Grizzlies going from their loud and ugly 4-11 start to this quiet and impressive bounce-back (now 9-12) is enough to make these next few months all the more interesting in Memphis.\n\nWith so much smoke, the Morant situation in Memphis is one that has to continue to be monitored.\n\nFor the latest Ja Morant rumors, click here.\n\nSince returning from injury, former No. 1 pick Anthony Davis has shown flashes of his former prime self, enjoying 32- and 29-point performances. Overall, in his last four games, Davis is averaging 20.0 points, 11.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.8 blocks on 51.5 percent shooting.\n\nHowever, according to a recent report, teams might be hesitant to trade for Davis anyway due to cap restrictions:\n\nThe reluctance of teams to trade multiple first round picks into the future is expected to impact the trade packages for Davis and potentially even Giannis Antetokounmpo. \"What I'm telling you is that when I talk to executives and these executives are not in trade talks with the Bucks or another for a star player right now, the mood in the NBA right now is not give up four first round picks for anybody,\" said Brian Windhorst on The Hoop Collective podcast on Friday. \"Okay, maybe if Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander) came on, or Victor (Wembanyama)... Like people don't want to do that because the aprons have spooked so many teams. All these teams are worried about getting into apron trouble where they can't reset their rosters. And you get into a situation like the Celtics were in where you got to rip your team down.\"\n\nAlso making teams wary is his troubling injury history, including in this very season:\n\nBrian Windhorst: I don't know what the value of Anthony Davis. Some of the stuff that I have heard from executives talking to me about what they think Anthony Davis' trade value is… I'm not even going to say it because then I'd get aggregated and people would be jumping down my throat and I would just be repeating something somebody else said. When I have heard what people are saying Anthony Davis' trade value is right now, not because of him as a player, to be clear, not because he's diminished as a player, but because of the idea of paying an injury-prone mid-30s guy $50, $60 million dollars in the apron era is unpalatable.\n\nWe aren’t entirely sure how the Davis saga unfolds. On one hand, he doesn’t fit the team’s current time frame, especially not with Kyrie Irving set to miss so much of this season. On the other, the Mavericks are a proud franchise and winners of four of their last five, so maybe they’d rather try to compete with Davis now healthy.\n\nFor the latest Anthony Davis rumors, click here.\n\nThe most interesting storyline of this trade deadline centers in Wisconsin, as reports have indicated that Giannis Antetokounmpo has already asked out of Milwaukee in favor of joining the New York Knicks…\n\nBrian Windhorst: The Bucks called the Knicks and asked for an offer for Giannis Antetokounmpo, because Giannis said, 'I want to be a Knick.' .... Guys, Giannis has asked to be traded already. It appears Giannis committed to himself for the season to the Bucks. But the Bucks are not good. This year, when Giannis hasn't played, the Bucks are 1-5. When he has played, they're 9-8. Would his viewpoint change? I don't know.\n\n…while the Bucks have reportedly told teams that the Greek superstar is not available:\n\nAs trade season draws close, everyone is talking about Giannis. Even though — and I want to underline this — the Bucks continue to tell teams: 'He’s not available. We don’t want your trade pitches.' So, it’s this weird deal where the Bucks keep shouting into the wind: 'Listen to us! We don’t want to talk trades with you about Giannis Antetokounmpo!' And the rest of the league just ignores it and obsesses about him.\"\n\nSince the initial report from ESPN’s Brian Windhorst came out, a plethora of reporting on the matter from other sources has come to light.\n\nESPN's Shams Charania, for example, reported afterward that Antetokounmpo and his camp have started talks with Milwaukee about whether or not Antetokounmpo will stay with the Bucks long-term:\n\nJust in: Giannis Antetokounmpo and his agent Alex Saratsis have started conversations with the Milwaukee Bucks about the two-time NBA MVP's future – and discussing whether his best fit is staying or elsewhere, sources tell ESPN. A resolution is expected in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/NfrpL2Ffvr\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) December 3, 2025\n\nESPN also reported that it wouldn’t be New-York-or-bust for Antetokounmpo:\n\nOver the offseason, Antetokounmpo explored external options and was open to playing for one team outside of Milwaukee -- the New York Knicks -- as a potential trade home. Sources described it as an exclusive negotiating window for the Knicks over a multiweek period in August, but that will not be the case moving forward. Multiple other teams would be expected to emerge as suitors for the nine-time All-Star if trades are explored.\n\nDoc Rivers, frustrated with the media and reporting on the matter, then said that Antetokounmpo hadn’t asked for a trade:\n\nDoc Rivers: \"I want to make it clear for the - I want to say one more time - for the 50th time, and clearly it's not getting to one network, for sure, Giannis has never asked to be traded. Ever. I can't make that more clear.\" https://t.co/e6XSo0OuP8\n\n— Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) December 3, 2025\n\nThe Lakers, Clippers and Heat were also reportedly mentioned as other potential suitors for the former league MVP, though they were waiting until he could hit free agency in 2027.\n\nAnd all of that is just a taste of the huge amount of reporting on the Antetokounmpo trade front over the last week.
