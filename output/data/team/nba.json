    "fullText": "The San Antonio Spurs are headed to the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, 132-119, on Wednesday, and might have Victor Wembanyama back in the lineup for the big tournament matchup. Following the team’s quarterfinal victory over the Lakers on Wednesday, Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson to reporters that Wemby might be ready to make his return from injury over the weekend.\n\n“Very much so,” coach Johnson said. “He had a really good day today. He had a very intense day this morning, and we’ll have to see how he responds or reacts (Thursday).”\n\nWemby went through an intense workout on Wednesday morning and then worked out again during pregame warmups before the Lakers game. He was able to get through that workout without any extra protection on his strained calf, according to Johnson.\n\nWembanyama has been sidelined with his calf strain and hasn’t played since Nov. 16. However, the Spurs have been able to get through this stretch and post a 9-3 record without their All-Star big man and defensive anchor. Wemby’s potential return couldn’t come at a better time as the Spurs will face the defending NBA Champion Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nIn Wembanyama's absence, other players like last season's Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle have had to step up even more to help carry the load. In Wednesday's win over the Lakers, Castle scored 30 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and dished 6 assists. De'Aaron Fox chipped in with 20 points, and Keldon Johnson scored 17 off the bench.\n\n“I think Victor would tell you we have a deep team, and we rely upon playing together as a team,” Johnson said. “He may be the biggest puzzle piece, but he needs everybody else to complete the puzzle.”\n\nAlthough Wemby has missed half of San Antonio’s 24 games this season, the Spurs are 17-7 overall and currently fifth in the Western Conference. When Wembanyama is on the court, he’s been as dominant as ever this season, averaging career-highs of 26.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, along with 3.6 blocks.\n\nSan Antonio and OKC square off in the Emirates NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday, Dec. 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The NBA Cup championship game will be played on Dec. 16 in Las Vegas.",

    "description": "The Lakers trailed by as much as 24 points in the fourth quarter while losing to the Spurs in an NBA Cup quarterfinal game.",
    "fullText": "Any chance the Lakers had at trying to capture a second NBA Cup championship in the third season of the tournament evaporated for good in the fourth quarter against a young, fast and athletic San Antonio Spurs team missing its best player.\n\nThe Lakers won the inaugural NBA Cup title in 2023 and had designs on winning it again in 2025 and the $500,000 cash that goes to each player on the championship team.\n\nBut it was not to be — not with the Lakers unable to slow down the Spurs during a 132-119 quarterfinal loss Wednesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers got down by as much as 24 points in the fourth and made a run to get to within eight points late in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Lakers got no closer and now will face the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday.\n\nThe Spurs will meet the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in Las Vegas in the semifinals.\n\nLuka Doncic had 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists, Marcus Smart came off the bench to score 26 and LeBron James had 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. But that wasn’t enough against a Spurs team that had seven players score in double figures.\n\nStephon Castle led the Spurs with 30 points and De’Aaron Fox had 20.\n\nWhen the Lakers needed someone to lift them when they got down by 18 points in the second, someone to provide them a spark when there wasn’t one for so much of the quarter, they finally got it from the oldest player on the court, 40-year-old LeBron James.\n\nJames drove down the lane and threw down a thunderous dunk over Spurs 7-1 center Luke Kornet, bringing the Lakers to within eight points and charging up the crowd in the process.\n\nJames growled and yelled in the face of the reeling Kornet. The crowd stood and cheered, now happy that there was a Lakers’ awakening.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t hold on to that momentum, falling behind 70-58 at the half.\n\nAnd then when the third quarter started, the Lakers came out flat, giving up back-to-back threes and two more easy baskets for the Spurs to fall into an 80-60 hole early in the third.\n\nThe Lakers didn’t make it easy on themselves either.\n\nDoncic got a technical foul in the first quarter after no foul was called after Kelly Olynyk smacked him in the face and Lakers coach JJ Redick was called for a technical foul in the second quarter.\n\nWhen the Lakers last faced the Spurs a little over a month ago here, San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama played in a game L.A. won, but speedy point guard De’Aaron Fox did not.\n\nIt was the opposite this time, with Fox playing and Wembanyama out with a left calf strain.\n\nThe 7-5 Wembanyama has been out for almost a month and the super-quick Fox has been back during that time, which has changed the dynamic of the Spurs, which meant the Lakers had to shift how they played defense against San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs are more guard-oriented with Fox, Castle and Dylan Harper.\n\nThe Lakers got a taste of how much faster the Spurs are now in the first quarter, when L.A. gave up 39 points and trailed by nine after the first frame.\n\nThe Spurs show 56% from the field in the first, 50% (six-for-12) from three-point range.\n\nKeldon Johnson came off the bench to score 13 points in the first quarter for the Spurs.\n\n\"Yeah, they're running a lot of pick and rolls with Fox, a lot of pick and rolls with Castle and Harper,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said pregame about the Spurs’ new way of playing. “And all those pick and rolls lead to drives, those pick and rolls lead to kick-outs and catch two threes and then more drives. So, we've got to do a good job of containing the basketball and do a good job of contesting.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James has fresh legs and no Victor Wembanyama to worry about when his Los Angeles Lakers host the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Cup quarterfinals tonight.\n\nHere are my best Spurs vs. Lakers predictions and NBA picks for December 10.\n\nSpurs vs Lakers best bet: LeBron James Over 18.5 points (-115)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have a full battery after last playing on December 7. That break will have the aging legs of LeBron James going all out in this NBA Cup contest.\n\nA game removed from his insane 10-point streak getting snapped, James put in his best performance of the season so far (he’s only played in seven games since returning in mid-November).\n\nHe shot 12-for-17 from the floor, including 4-for-6 from 3-point range, and scored 29 points in the win over the 76eron s Sunday. LeBron was mired in a shooting funk the three games prior, going a collective 12-for-40 in those showings (30%).\n\n“Just at 40 years old, I mean, it just takes a while for my body to kind of get back into a rhythm,” James told the media about snapping his shooting skid. “And so, it felt good tonight to kind of feel like myself a little bit, being able to run and jump and cut and catch my second wind a lot faster tonight. Hopefully that stays.”\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs were hoping to have Victor Wembanyama back for this tournament tilt as he traveled with the team to L.A. However, the Spurs were quick to announce that he would not play, updating his status last night.\n\nSan Antonio desperately misses the 7-footer on both ends of the floor, but the defense has seen a notable slip without Wemby’s length causing chaos. The Spurs were the No. 6 team in advanced defensive rating before his injury in mid-November and have slid to 21st in that metric in the 11 games without him.\n\nThe interior protection has fallen off a cliff without Wembanyama’s 8-foot-4 wingspan blocking and changing shots. San Antonio allows the second fewest points in the paint per game (40) with him in action, but sees opponents’ PITP surge to 55.6 (29th) since his calf injury.\n\nJames is averaging 7.7 PITP in his first seven games since missing the start of the schedule with back issues — making up 48% of this scoring output. Against the Sixers on Sunday, LeBron upped that inside presence to 10 points in the painted area.\n\nProjections for today’s NBA Cup game have James pegged for around 17 points, but with models updating for Wembanyama’s absence, those forecasts sit closer to 20 points against the Spurs tonight.\n\nJames looks like he worked off the rust and can attack this Spurs interior without Wemby on the court.\n\nSan Antonio’s defensive chops have crumbled without their star in the middle. The Spurs have gone Over the total in five of their last six games.\n\nThe Lakers just have too much firepower for the Spurs to handle, especially on their home court.\n\nHarrison Barnes has upped his scoring in Wembanyama’s absence and scored 24 last time out against the Pelicans.\n\nHarrison Barnes Over 12.5 points\n\nSpread: Spurs +6.5 | Lakers -6.5\n\nMoneyline: Spurs +200 | Lakers -240\n\nOver/Under: Over 237.5 | Under 237.5\n\nThe Spurs are 8-4 Over/Under as a visitor this season and have topped the total in 57% of their road games going back to last season.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Orlando Magic trailed 15-0 on Tuesday night in the NBA Cup quarterfinal round to the Miami Heat.\n\nThat's when Desmond Bane took over.\n\nAnd by the end of the night, the Magic had made up for their early stumble and won, 117-108. Bane was the story of the evening.\n\nBane dropped 37 points, making 14-of-24 shots from the floor, including 6-for-9 in a blistering showing from beyond the 3-point line.\n\nHe finished at the rim through contact and showed patience on multiple different pump fake moves beyond the arc to free himself up for shots.\n\nBane added six rebounds and five assists as he stepped up in the absence of Franz Wagner, who is out with a left leg injury.\n\nMORE: AJ Dybantsa makes basketball history only ever done by Stephen Curry\n\nAfter the game, Bane gave a simple explanation for why he had been so motivated.\n\n“I just lost $35,000,\" he told reporters. \"I gotta go get it back somehow.”\n\nBane is referencing the amount he was fined for throwing the basketball at Knicks forward OG Anunoby in the Magic's most recent game.\n\nEach advancement in the NBA Cup is worth money (more than $35,000, so Bane even has some spare change when all is said and done).\n\nThe Magic will take on the New York Knicks in the NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday in Las Vegas. Bane and Anunoby will be right back out there on the floor against one another.

    "fullText": "A pizza chain founded by the brother of tennis star Michael Chang, and once backed by NBA superstar Kevin Durant, is seeking bankruptcy protection after years of store closures.\n\nThe parent company of Pieology filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in California, stating that its debts exceed its assets by at least double. The filing lists over 200 creditors, including many landlords and vendors.\n\nThe chain, founded in 2011, built its reputation on letting customers \"craft\" their own pizzas, calzones, and other foods. By 2022, it was boasting 130 locations in a press release announcing Shawn Thompson, a former Tim Hortons executive, as its CEO.\n\nIts website lists nearly 40 locations, mainly in California, but also in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. Thompson, whose LinkedIn page suggests his term as CEO ended last month, didn't return a request for comment.\n\nRepresentatives for Pieology, which is expected to continue operating while the bankruptcy proceeds, didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to the bankruptcy filing for Pieology's parent company, The Little Brown Box Pizza, Chang is also seeking bankruptcy protection for a company called Kustom Partner, which appears to be the administrative arm of Pieology.\n\nThe two companies filed for a form of Chapter 11 designed for small businesses that allows them to keep operating while they restructure their debts under court supervision.\n\nListed among Kustom Partner's creditors were numerous tax collectors from Florida, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii, Idaho, Georgia, Arizona, and more.\n\nIn a 2017 story about Durant's investment in Pieology, the basketball legend told ESPN that he was \"impressed with the quality\" of the pizza chain. Representatives for Durant didn't return a request for comment about the status of their investment. Pieology's bankruptcy filing said no one owns more than 10% of the company, suggesting no current institutional owners.\n\nThe Little Brown Box Pizza listed assets of between $100,000 and $500,000 compared to liabilities, or money owed, of between $1 million and $10 million.",

    "fullText": "Indiana Pacers fans don't have to wait until next season to see Tyrese Haliburton make his season debut ... as a broadcaster, that is.\n\nHaliburton will make his debut as a player contributor on \"NBA on Prime\" with an appearance on \"NBA Nightcap\" following Tuesday night's NBA Cup quarterfinals matchups — the first of five such appearances this season. On \"NBA Nightcap,\" Haliburton is expected to offer commentary on his rehab and game insights for the 2025-26 season.\n\nThe postgame analysis show is in its first season, hosted by broadcaster Taylor Rooks, featuring former NBA legends Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, Steve Nash and Udonis Haslem, discussing the evening's NBA action.\n\nWhen discussing the opportunity with The Athletic, Haliburton spoke highly of the positivity of the broadcast's coverage and its ability to reach the casual fan:\n\n\"I think just being able to talk about the game with people, and not always having to be so critical of players, but just how we can talk about the game and put today’s players in the right limelight. I think it is important.\"\n\n\"I think that our league, arguably, is one of the only leagues where people are so critical of players that sometimes it can create opinions from the casual fan that they don’t even know what they’re talking about.\"\n\n“It’s just what they’re hearing on television. I think that Prime is doing a great job of just allowing former players to come on and celebrate our game, which I think is better just overall for everybody.”\n\nLast season, Haliburton averaged 18.6 points, 9.2 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game. His late-game heroics in the playoffs helped lead the Pacers to beat the Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers and the New York Knicks to advance to their first NBA Finals appearance since 2000.\n\nThis year, the Pacers have struggled to fill Haliburton's void as a scorer and playmaker. The Pacers are 6-18, currently 14th in the Eastern Conference, while ranking 29th in points per game and last in field goal percentage. Last season, they were seventh and third in those categories, respectively.\n\nPascal Siakam is the team's leading scorer this season, averaging 24.5 points, 7 rebounds and 4.1 assists. Fourth-year guard Bennedict Mathurin is also having a career campaign, averaging 21.5 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game.\n\nThe Pacers have struggled to create assists without their leading playmaker, giving Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell expanded playmaking roles. The Pacers are last in assists, averaging 23.5 per game. Last season, they were third in assists per game, averaging 29.2 per game.\n\nInjuries have also taken a toll on this team, with Mathurin, Nembhard and Obi Toppin all missing a significant portion of the early season. The Pacers are currently on a two-game winning streak and play the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.",

    "description": "Bet on Scottie Barnes from beyond the arc in our Knicks vs. Raptors picks, odds & expert predictions for the NBA Cup Quarterfinals on Tuesday, December 9.",
    "fullText": "The Toronto Raptors were roaring when they earned one of the top seeds in the NBA Cup, but then RJ Barrett got hurt, and suddenly the Raptors looked toothless.\n\nBut they’ll need to find some bite from beyond the arc if they want to move on to the semifinals against a New York Knicks team that’s playing some great basketball.\n\nMy Knicks vs. Raptors predictions break down this NBA Cup quarterfinals matchup with my best NBA picks.\n\nKnicks vs Raptors best bet: Scottie Barnes Over 1.5 threes (+140)\n\nIt’s pretty clear at this point what RJ Barrett has meant to the Toronto Raptors this season.\n\nToronto was in a groove with a 12-5 record before Barrett hurt his knee in a November 23 meeting with the Brooklyn Nets. Since them, the Raptors are just 3-5 straight up and 1-7 against the spread, including 1-5 SU and 0-6 ATS in their last six overall.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Knicks are starting to play their best basketball of the season. They are 7-1 SU/ATS in their last eight overall, which includes a 116-94 win over the Raps at Madison Square Garden back on November 30.\n\nHowever, the Knicks are an interesting team. They basically live and die by the three-ball. New York attempts the sixth-most threes per game with the fifth-highest shooting percentage while at the same time allowing opponents to take the fourth-most threes per game and ranking 19th in opponent three-point shooting percentage.\n\nNow, with the way these teams are trending, I lean toward the Knicks covering this spread, but one of the Raptors' strengths is defending the perimeter (third-best opponent three-point shooting perentage), and are a better team at home, so I hesitate a little there.\n\nBut someone without hesitation for the Raptors this season is Scottie Barnes. The former Rookie of the Year is having a great season, averaging 20 points, 8.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game. He is also shooting the ball better than ever before, draining a career-high 39.8% of his threes.\n\nHe’s shooting 40% from beyond the arc over his last five games, hitting two or more three times. That includes going 4-for-7 from deep in that November 30 meeting against the Knicks.\n\nThe Raptors know if they want to pull off the upset in this NBA Cup quarterfinal, they’ll have to hit some threes, so there is a ton of value for Barnes to nail a few more on Tuesday night.\n\nWhile it didn’t quite make best bet status, I’ll happily add Knicks -4.5 to this SGP. Not only does it not create the negative correlation we love for these SGPs, but New York is just playing very well right now.\n\nThe Knicks have won seven of their last eight games with a net rating that only trails the Oklahoma City Thunder during that stretch. With the Raptors still struggling to find consistency without RJ Barrett, it’s hard to back them when it comes to covering this number in this spot.\n\nAnd it’s the Raptors' offense that has really struggled in Barrett’s absence. They rank next-to-last in offensive rating since Barrett got hurt, and the Under is 6-3 in those nine games without him. That includes the most recent matchup with the Knicks.\n\nOG Anunoby returns to Toronto with a bang. In his second game back from injury he went 5-for-7 from three and you know he's comfortable in Scotiabank Arena.\n\nSpread: Knicks -4.5 | Raptors +4.5\n\nMoneyline: Knicks -190 | Raptors +165\n\nOver/Under: Over 226.5 | Under 226.5\n\nThe Raptors are 0-7 against the spread in their last seven games in a row. All without RJ Barrett, who will be out once again Tuesday night.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere's really only one question to be asked: What was Desmond Bane doing?\n\nIf you missed it, the Orlando Magic guard gathered a loose ball, while still in bounds, and chose to chuck it at New York Knicks forward OG Anunoby, who had sprawled out of bounds. It got the Magic the ball for an inbounds, yes, but it seemed entirely unnecessary.\n\nBane wasn't falling out of bounds himself. He could've just grabbed the ball and went the other way.\n\nBut why do that when you can let loose a powerful right-handed throw?\n\nDesmond Bane WYD⁉️😭 pic.twitter.com/WTU2qswlYK\n\n— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) December 7, 2025\n\nAnunoby clearly wasn't happy, but there wasn't an obvious way for the officials to punish Bane during action.\n\nThe NBA didn't like the optics, though. They announced Tuesday that Bane has been fined $35,000 for his actions.\n\nDesmond Bane fined $35,000 for throwing ball with force at OG Anunoby, NBA says pic.twitter.com/ky7yfRVZYm\n\n— Ian Begley (@IanBegley) December 8, 2025\n\nBane has made a play like this before, so for some reason, it's in his repertoire.\n\nBut his wallet is a bit lighter now. He may want to consider, if he's going to toss the ball at his opponent out of bounds, at least doing it a bit lighter next time, too.\n\nMORE: Jalen Hurts made the worst play in fantasy football history",

    "fullText": "As we inch closer to the NBA trade deadline of 2026-27, bigger names are starting to pop up in rumors, including that of one former NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nToday, that player leads off our latest Trade Rumors Rankings series, in which we rank the five players who have appeared most often in trade rumors over the previous week.\n\nFour-time All-Star Trae Young hasn't played since Oct. 29, and yet the Atlanta Hawks are off to as good a start as they've had in years, sitting at 14-11.\n\nLike other enigmatic point guards, Young has heard his name mentioned in trade rumors this season, including in this report from ESPN:\n\nCharlotte's LaMelo Ball, Memphis' Ja Morant and Atlanta's Trae Young all seem to be stuck in a sort of limbo with the franchises that they've been the faces of since entering the league as high lottery picks. There is rampant speculation among rival teams that Ball, Morant and Young could all be available leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline. For a variety of reasons, from their maximum contracts to their major flaws, it's not a discussion that generates much enthusiasm despite their status as big names who have put up big numbers. \"I wouldn't want any of them,\" a Western Conference general manager told ESPN. That was a popular opinion in an informal poll of executives, scouts and coaches conducted by ESPN. There wasn't a consensus about which one of the three would command the biggest return if they ended up getting shopped in the trade market, as votes were split among Ball, Morant and Young. \"They all might have negative value,\" an Eastern Conference executive said.\n\nSpeaking of how well the Hawks are playing without Young, an anonymous source criticized Young more to ESPN:\n\nIn other words, the Hawks with Young in the lineup would rank dead last in the league in defensive efficiency. Without him, the Hawks have defended at a top-five level. \"He's just small and doesn't play any defense,\" an East scout said. That scout valued Young more than Morant and Ball, primarily because of his offensive prowess and lack of off-court concerns. Several people mentioned the long-running perception that he's unpopular with teammates as worrisome, especially considering that Young creates so many dunks and open looks with his passing prowess.\n\nThe thing is, Young has proven in the past to be up to the task of leading a team on a deep playoff run. He just has to have a great team around him. Maybe Atlanta will be fine staying put with Young at the helm once he returns, as the team does have a strong roster this season.\n\nEither way, it doesn't seem his trade value is all that high right now.\n\nFor the latest Trae Young rumors, click here.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans, owners of the worst record in the NBA at 3-22, don't have much going right for them these days, including Zion Williamson being set to miss even more time due to injury. As such, the team is naturally hearing a lot of noise as far as potential trades recently.\n\nOne player who has come up in such rumors is 25-year-old swingman Trey Murphy, who is averaging 20.5 points and 6.5 rebounds on 36.3 three-point percent shooting this season.\n\nAccording to NBA reporter Jake Fischer, the Pelicans are starting to listen to offers on the Murphy trade front:\n\nAnd there are definitely teams that believe that have told me as recently as today that New Orleans is now starting to listen and at least show some type of willingness to listen on guys like Herb Jones and Trey Murphy as well. And those guys are going to have a lot of interest around the league.\n\nThat report was negated by a Pelicans blogger, though…\n\nSharmit Dua: The Pelicans have not had any conversations with teams regarding Trey Murphy, Herb Jones, or Zion Williamson per source familiar with the matter\n\n…so it should be taken for what it’s worth.\n\nIn the NBA, players are untouchable until they aren’t, and considering how far off the Pelicans are from contention, there shouldn’t be a player on their roster who is not up for grabs on the trade market, at least anyone who isn’t a rookie.\n\nNew Orleans is certainly a team that should be kept an eye on as we get closer to the trade deadline.\n\nFor the latest Trey Murphy rumors, click here.\n\nFischer dropped another surprising nugget recently when he reported that the Miami Heat of all teams have had internal discussions about picking up Ja Morant.\n\nMiami was already shaping into a surprising buyer on this trade market even before this week's Giannis headlines. League sources say that the Heat, for example, have had internal discussions about Memphis' Ja Morant and how Miami's infrastructure could benefit him.\n\nWe’re not entirely sure how that fit would work, especially with how steady Davion Mitchell has been running point for Miami this season. With the Heat performing better than expected this year, and the team fully at peace after the departure of Jimmy Butler, going after Morant doesn’t make the most sense for Miami, in our estimation.\n\nAt the same time, there’s no denying his massive talent level. And Miami probably won’t contend this season without more truly elite talent, so who knows? Maybe this is a swing they decide to take in an attempt to hit a grand slam.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the Sacramento Kings and Minnesota Timberwolves are monitoring the Morant trade front:\n\nTeams such as Sacramento and the Minnesota Timberwolves (and likely many more) that were known to be monitoring the situation before will continue to do so, all while watching closely when Ja Morant returns (his initial timeline had him slated for a possible early December return). Still, the Grizzlies going from their loud and ugly 4-11 start to this quiet and impressive bounce-back (now 9-12) is enough to make these next few months all the more interesting in Memphis.\n\nWith so much smoke, the Morant situation in Memphis is one that has to continue to be monitored.\n\nFor the latest Ja Morant rumors, click here.\n\nSince returning from injury, former No. 1 pick Anthony Davis has shown flashes of his former prime self, enjoying 32- and 29-point performances. Overall, in his last four games, Davis is averaging 20.0 points, 11.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.8 blocks on 51.5 percent shooting.\n\nHowever, according to a recent report, teams might be hesitant to trade for Davis anyway due to cap restrictions:\n\nThe reluctance of teams to trade multiple first round picks into the future is expected to impact the trade packages for Davis and potentially even Giannis Antetokounmpo. \"What I'm telling you is that when I talk to executives and these executives are not in trade talks with the Bucks or another for a star player right now, the mood in the NBA right now is not give up four first round picks for anybody,\" said Brian Windhorst on The Hoop Collective podcast on Friday. \"Okay, maybe if Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander) came on, or Victor (Wembanyama)... Like people don't want to do that because the aprons have spooked so many teams. All these teams are worried about getting into apron trouble where they can't reset their rosters. And you get into a situation like the Celtics were in where you got to rip your team down.\"\n\nAlso making teams wary is his troubling injury history, including in this very season:\n\nBrian Windhorst: I don't know what the value of Anthony Davis. Some of the stuff that I have heard from executives talking to me about what they think Anthony Davis' trade value is… I'm not even going to say it because then I'd get aggregated and people would be jumping down my throat and I would just be repeating something somebody else said. When I have heard what people are saying Anthony Davis' trade value is right now, not because of him as a player, to be clear, not because he's diminished as a player, but because of the idea of paying an injury-prone mid-30s guy $50, $60 million dollars in the apron era is unpalatable.\n\nWe aren’t entirely sure how the Davis saga unfolds. On one hand, he doesn’t fit the team’s current time frame, especially not with Kyrie Irving set to miss so much of this season. On the other, the Mavericks are a proud franchise and winners of four of their last five, so maybe they’d rather try to compete with Davis now healthy.\n\nFor the latest Anthony Davis rumors, click here.\n\nThe most interesting storyline of this trade deadline centers in Wisconsin, as reports have indicated that Giannis Antetokounmpo has already asked out of Milwaukee in favor of joining the New York Knicks…\n\nBrian Windhorst: The Bucks called the Knicks and asked for an offer for Giannis Antetokounmpo, because Giannis said, 'I want to be a Knick.' .... Guys, Giannis has asked to be traded already. It appears Giannis committed to himself for the season to the Bucks. But the Bucks are not good. This year, when Giannis hasn't played, the Bucks are 1-5. When he has played, they're 9-8. Would his viewpoint change? I don't know.\n\n…while the Bucks have reportedly told teams that the Greek superstar is not available:\n\nAs trade season draws close, everyone is talking about Giannis. Even though — and I want to underline this — the Bucks continue to tell teams: 'He’s not available. We don’t want your trade pitches.' So, it’s this weird deal where the Bucks keep shouting into the wind: 'Listen to us! We don’t want to talk trades with you about Giannis Antetokounmpo!' And the rest of the league just ignores it and obsesses about him.\"\n\nSince the initial report from ESPN’s Brian Windhorst came out, a plethora of reporting on the matter from other sources has come to light.\n\nESPN's Shams Charania, for example, reported afterward that Antetokounmpo and his camp have started talks with Milwaukee about whether or not Antetokounmpo will stay with the Bucks long-term:\n\nJust in: Giannis Antetokounmpo and his agent Alex Saratsis have started conversations with the Milwaukee Bucks about the two-time NBA MVP's future – and discussing whether his best fit is staying or elsewhere, sources tell ESPN. A resolution is expected in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/NfrpL2Ffvr\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) December 3, 2025\n\nESPN also reported that it wouldn’t be New-York-or-bust for Antetokounmpo:\n\nOver the offseason, Antetokounmpo explored external options and was open to playing for one team outside of Milwaukee -- the New York Knicks -- as a potential trade home. Sources described it as an exclusive negotiating window for the Knicks over a multiweek period in August, but that will not be the case moving forward. Multiple other teams would be expected to emerge as suitors for the nine-time All-Star if trades are explored.\n\nDoc Rivers, frustrated with the media and reporting on the matter, then said that Antetokounmpo hadn’t asked for a trade:\n\nDoc Rivers: \"I want to make it clear for the - I want to say one more time - for the 50th time, and clearly it's not getting to one network, for sure, Giannis has never asked to be traded. Ever. I can't make that more clear.\" https://t.co/e6XSo0OuP8\n\n— Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) December 3, 2025\n\nThe Lakers, Clippers and Heat were also reportedly mentioned as other potential suitors for the former league MVP, though they were waiting until he could hit free agency in 2027.\n\nAnd all of that is just a taste of the huge amount of reporting on the Antetokounmpo trade front over the last week.
