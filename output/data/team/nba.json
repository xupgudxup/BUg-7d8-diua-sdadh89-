    "description": "Peterson is viewed as the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NBA Draft, but questions about his availability could affect that status.",
    "fullText": "Amid star player Darryn Peterson facing criticism for missing games or leaving them early due to injuries or illness, Kansas men's basketball coach Bill Self says the freshman guard must take initiative to change the national conversation about him.\n\n\"There is a way to change the narrative. Play. Finish,\" Self told reporters on Friday. \"Now, if his body allows him to, fantastic. If it doesn't allow him to, then they'll say something again the next game.\"\n\n\"But that's the way to get people to quit talking,\" he added. \"It's not me saying, 'It's not fair.' I don't think that really keeps anybody from having an opinion on a national level, or on this level, or any level, to be quite candid.\"\n\nPeterson, 19, has played in only 15 of the Jayhawks' 26 games this season. But he has also left three of those games early, most recently Wednesday's 81-69 win over Oklahoma State. Peterson has missed games due to hamstring, quad and ankle injuries and taken himself out because of flu-like symptoms and cramping.\n\nThat limited availability has led to questions about Peterson protecting himself for the 2026 NBA Draft, which could affect his prospects of being the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nSelf says the speculation over why Peterson has missed games or finished them early is misguided, but acknowledges that such conjecture can't be controlled.\n\n\"He hasn't finished games. The reasons why they say he hasn't finished games is 100% false,\" Self said. \"So, at least in 70 to 80% of the reasons why, with what they've said that I've heard. I can't say 100% of everything would be false, but that's the narrative that's being out there.\"\n\nThe Kansas coach asserted the speculation over Peterson's mindset is \"100% false,\" then seemed to say, well, maybe it's not entirely false. But that chatter will only be silenced if Peterson plays and continues to show the talent that makes many evaluators believe he will be the top player available in this summer's NBA Draft.\n\nBill Self on Darryn Peterson:\n\n\"He hasn't finished games... The bottom line is, there is a way to change the narrative: Play. Finish. That's the way to get people to quit talking.\" 👀\n\n(🎥: @KUsports) pic.twitter.com/71bbB7sD7q\n\n— The Field of 68 (@TheFieldOf68) February 20, 2026\n\n[Get more Jayhawks news: Kansas team feed]\n\nIn his 15 games, Peterson has averaged 20 points per game while shooting 43% on 3-pointers. Despite leaving the matchup with Oklahoma State after playing 18 minutes, he still scored 23 points and shot 6-for-10 from long range. Peterson scored a season-high 32 points in a 104-100 overtime win over TCU. That's the kind of production that has NBA teams coveting the opportunity to draft him.\n\nSelf supported Peterson, saying that he's dedicated to basketball in addition to being a gifted scorer.\n\nI don't know that we've had a guy that studies the game, has prepared himself for this moreso than what Darryn Peterson has,\" Self said. \"He loves ball. He can't get enough ball... Nobody's put more time in outside of practice working on their game on an individual than what he has over a lifetime.\"\n\nWith five games remaining in Kansas' regular season, along with the Big 12 conference and NCAA tournaments approaching, Peterson has plenty of opportunity to alter whatever perceptions are being formed about him. Especially if that includes a national championship run. The Jayhawks face Cincinnati (14-12) on Saturday before big matchups versus No. 2 Houston (23-3) and No. 4 Arizona (24-2) next week.",

    "title": "Adam Silver talks potential new tanking remedies for next season with team GMs",
    "description": "Adam Silver continues to look for an elusive solution to tanking, but even NBA owners don't agree on it.",
    "fullText": "During All-Star Weekend, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, \"We're going to be scrutinizing everything we see going forward\" regarding teams tanking, and that the league would be looking at \"every possible remedy.\"\n\nDuring a Thursday phone call with all 30 general managers, an adamant Silver said tanking needs to be curtailed for the integrity of the game and laid out potential remedies, according to multiple reports. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, some of the potential moves discussed by Silver included:\n\n• Freezing the lottery odds at an earlier, specific date (hypothetically, All-Star weekend), so teams don't have a motivation to play poorly during the season's stretch run.\n\n• Limiting draft protections to 1-4 or lottery (top 14), eliminating what Utah and Washington are doing this season where they are working to protect top-eight protected picks.\n\n• Not allowing teams to pick in the top four in consecutive years.\n\n• Including all the play-in teams in the lottery.\n\n• Flattening the lottery odds so every team has the same chance.\n\nAll of those \"solutions\" would create new challenges. Freeze the lottery odds at the All-Star break and teams will start tanking earlier, in the heart of the season. Taking away teams' ability to pick in the top four in consecutive years takes a key team-building tool for smaller markets — it's how San Antonio got so good right now.\n\nEven Silver's owners are not all on the same page.\n\nMat Ishbia of the Suns said tanking was for losers.\n\nThis is ridiculous! Tanking is losing behavior done by losers. Purposely losing is something nobody should want to be associated with. Embarrassing for the league and for the organizations. And the talk about this as a “strategy” is ridiculous. \n\nIf you are a bad team, you get a… https://t.co/VoUx3YEdB5\n\n— Mat Ishbia (@Mishbia15) February 19, 2026\n\nMark Cuban said the NBA should embrace tanking.\n\nWhy the NBA should embrace tanking - \n\nThe NBA has kate been misguided thinking that fans want to see their teams compete every night with a chance to win. It’s never been that way that way. \n\nWhen I got into the nba, they thought they were in the basketball business. They…\n\n— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 17, 2026\n\nIn the end, there may be no solution because landing a high pick and getting a player such as Cade Cunningham, Anthony Edwards, Cooper Flagg or Victor Wembanyama (to name just the recent examples) changes the fortunes and value of a franchise. Teams are going to do what it takes to give themselves the best chance to win. Flatten the lottery odds and the league has to accept the risk that a good team — and if the pick was traded, maybe the league's best team — could end up with the No. 1 pick. Teams are trying to sell their fan base either on winning (\"we are contenders/very good right now, so come watch us\") or on hope for the future. Reduce the bad teams' lottery odds, and you reduce that hope.\n\nThere is no easy answer. But Silver is determined to do something.",

    "description": "For the first time in his NBA career, Chicago Bulls guard Jaden Ivey finished a game with a “DNP — coach’s decision” next to his name in the box score.

    "fullText": "For the first time in his NBA career, Chicago Bulls guard Jaden Ivey finished a game with a “DNP — coach’s decision” next to his name in the box score.\n\nThe guard did not play in Thursday’s 110-101 loss to the Toronto Raptors at the United Center despite not being listed on the injury report. Acting coach Wes Unseld Jr. said Ivey’s absence was purely a basketball decision, but the guard alluded to lingering knee soreness as a partial cause for the healthy scratch. Ivey said he is still practicing fully despite the injury and believes he is fully available to play.\n\n“I’m sure people can call it out that I’m not the same player as I used to be,” Ivey, 24, said. “That’s why. I’m not the JI I used to be. But the old JI is dead. I’m alive in Christ. … No matter how many DNP’s I don’t get to play or no matter how many points I score, those things are a temporary thing.”\n\nThis could be a new status quo for the Bulls, whose roster includes six guards. Unseld spoke with the team at shootaround Thursday morning to address the reality that players might see a reduction in their minutes as the team attempts to figure out healthy rotations. The decision was made in conjunction with coach Billy Donovan, who was not with the team following the death of his father.\n\nBut Ivey said he was not informed heading into the game that he would not play at all against the Raptors.\n\n“Obviously going into it you’ve got to look at who’s on the roster,” Ivey said. “This team has a lot of guards, so going into it I’m kind of just thrown in. I do my job to the glory of God so I’m ready for whenever my name is called. Whenever (the) coach needs me, calls my name, I’ll be out there to play. Getting traded, that’s what happens in the NBA. You get traded, the organization figures out what the team needs and they make their adjustments.”\n\nSixteen days ago, Ivey was logging 16.8 minutes per game for the best team in the East. The Bulls traded for him with the intention of investing in his future as a young playmaker. And Ivey had been decently productive in his first four games with the Bulls, averaging 11.5 points and four assists. He joked about his hefty workload after playing 33 minutes in his debut against the Raptors on Feb. 5 and averaged 28.8 minutes for the Bulls before the All-Star break.\n\nAs a restricted free agent this summer, Ivey is not guaranteed to return to Chicago for the 2026-27 season. But the Bulls have been publicly insistent that they plan to test out every player they acquired at the deadline as a potential option to be re-signed in the offseason.\n\nIvey shied away from expressing how Thursday’s game — or further lack of playing time — could affect his feelings toward the Bulls in free agency, repeatedly turning to his faith as a guiding post among uncertainty on the court.\n\n“I don’t really trust the NBA setting,” Ivey said. “I trust the Lord. That’s the main thing. He places me where I need to be. … When moves are made behind the scenes of trades and stuff, I don’t trust that part. You can’t trust it, because it’s not in your hands. It’s not in my hands to make moves or trade myself or put myself in a certain position. I leave that up to the Lord.”\n\nWho are the 7 new Chicago Bulls? Meet Jaden Ivey, Anfernee Simons and the rest of the deadline additions.\n\nThursday marked a season-high-tying seventh consecutive loss in their first game back from the All-Star break. Despite forcing a clutch finish with a 7-0 run in the final stretch of the fourth quarter, the Bulls couldn’t fend off a 31-point game from Brandon Ingram, who knocked down a dagger 3-pointer with 35.5 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Bulls have lost 10 of their last 11 games, a result directly tied to their decision to dump the majority of their players on expiring contracts at the trade deadline. And the schedule will only get harder this weekend when the Bulls host a home back-to-back against the Detroit Pistons and the New York Knicks.\n\nHere are three more takeaways from the loss.\n\nUnseld helmed the Bulls for the game in the stead of coach Billy Donovan, who was away from the team to spend time with his family after the death of his father, Bill Donovan Sr.\n\nThe elder Donovan died Saturday at age 85. He was a member of the Boston College Hall of Fame after captaining the team and graduating in 1962 as the program’s third-leading scorer.\n\nDonovan Jr. is expected to return Friday to Chicago and could resume his coaching duties for this weekend’s back-to-back.\n\nThe Bulls returned to a vague semblance of their former selves with guards Giddey and Jones back on the court. The pair had been sidelined for a considerable stretch of the season (19 games for Giddey, 11 for Jones) before the All-Star break with hamstring injuries.\n\nJalen Smith also returned to the lineup after missing five of the last seven games before the break with a calf injury. Although his absence was less extensive, it had a bigger impact because of his status as the only remaining center on the roster from before the trade deadline.\n\nUnseld was cagey about the playing-time restrictions for all three players, declining to share details about any of their medical limits during his pregame news conference. Giddey played 21 minutes, 25 seconds and Jones 21:51 while Smith logged 24:20.\n\nBoth guards failed to score in the first half. Jones warmed into his offense in the third quarter and finished with 12 points, but Smith and Giddey struggled to connect on their shots. Smith finished with nine points on 2-for-6 shooting while Giddey scored five points on 1-for-7 shooting. Giddey added five assists while committing four turnovers.\n\nThe Bulls still aren’t playing cohesive basketball. In fact, it’s unclear whether they’ll be able to accomplish that feat — piecing together a collective identity out of a haphazard puzzle of misfit deadline acquisitions — before the regular season ends.\n\nAgainst the Raptors, that translated into sloppy basketball. The first quarter took 35 minutes to be completed as both teams combined for nine fouls and 13 turnovers. Collin Sexton turned the ball over three times in that span, including an eight-second violation when he failed to advance the ball past half-court. The Bulls gave up 28 points off 20 turnovers for the game.\n\nMatas Buzelis once again receded in a loss, scoring only four points in nearly 31:20 before getting pulled from the closing lineup. Anfernee Simons (20 points) and Isaac Okoro (16) combined for nearly one-third of the team’s scoring, but neither player looked comfortable in their respective rotations.",

    "fullText": "A dominant Cade Cunningham scored 42 points as the NBA-leading Detroit Pistons swatted aside the New York Knicks 126-111 Thursday on the basketball league's return from its brief All-Star Game break.\n\nBilled as a must-watch clash between two Eastern Conference-vying rivals each in red-hot form, the game at Madison Square Garden became an exhibition for Cunningham, who also provided 13 assists and eight rebounds.\n\nThe 24-year-old burnished his credentials as a Most Valuable Player contender, helping a young, surprise-package Pistons side to improve the best record in the entire NBA this season so far, to 41-13.\n\nAfter the game, Cunningham insisted he and his side had proved \"nothing\" yet.\n\n\"It's regular season, so we just have to keep on chipping at it, keep on growing, keep on getting better and preparing for the postseason,\" he said.\n\n\"We're off to a great start. Obviously, we feel great about that. But everything is to come.\"\n\nDespite their blistering form, Detroit -- wholly reconstructed after finishing rock-bottom of the Eastern Conference just two years ago -- are still few pundits' top pick to win the title.\n\nThey were also without forward Isaiah Stewart and All-Star center Jalen Duren on Thursday, due to suspensions following a brawl with the Charlotte Hornets during game last week.\n\n\"Missing Stew, JD, that's a big part of our team. Big part of why we are where we are. So everyone had to step up,\" said Cunningham.\n\nAnd the Knicks had entered the game third in the Eastern Conference, on a run of 10 wins from 12, comparable to the Pistons' 12 from 15 ahead of Thursday's clash.\n\nBut Detroit had extra motivation -- revenge after the Knicks knocked them out of the playoffs last year in the first round. The win on Thursday completes a three-win regular season sweep over the Knicks.\n\n\"If felt great,\" said Cunningham, who poured in three three-pointers in the first quarter alone. He added two more later in the game, with other highlights including a huge, driving dunk in the third quarter.\n\nElsewhere, Jaylen Brown recorded a triple-double as the in-form Boston Celtics overwhelmed the Golden State Warriors 121-110.\n\nConsolidating second spot in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics led by as much as 34 points in the third quarter, before the Warriors reduced the deficit but to no avail.\n\nBrown managed 23 points, 13 assists and 15 rebounds, while Payton Pritchard top-scored with 26 from the bench, in the Celtics' seventh win from their past eight games.\n\nThursday's games were the first since the NBA regular season briefly paused for the All-Star Game weekend.\n\n\"It's early, first game back,\" said Brown.\n\n\"I'm just being aggressive, finding my spots,\" he added.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers earned a sixth consecutive win. The Cavs beat the Brooklyn Nets 112-84 to draw level with the Knicks in third place.\n\nJalen Johnson dominated a 117-107 Atlanta Hawks road win over the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 32 points, with 10 rebounds, five assists and three steals.\n\nKevin Durant managed 35 points in the Houston Rockets' 105-101 victory over the Hornets.\n\nIn the West, the Sacramento Kings set an unwanted franchise record with a 15-game losing streak, after going down 131-94 to the Orlando Magic.\n\nAnd the second-placed San Antonio Spurs put some pressure on the leaders, Oklahoma City Thunder, with a 121-94 triumph over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nThe Spurs' seventh consecutive win takes them to 39-16, still trailing the Thunder on 42-14.",

    "fullText": "SAN ANTONIO – The Phoenix Suns have emerged from the NBA All-Star break healthy as they have no one listed on their injury report due to an injury.\n\nThe Suns (32-23) face the San Antonio Spurs (38-16) Thursday, Feb. 19, at Moody Center on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin. They are seventh in the Western Conference while the Spurs are second.\n\nGrayson Allen (right knee sprain) and Isaiah Livers (left shoulder sprain) suffered injuries against the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 5 and sat out the next three games going into the NBA All-Star break.\n\nThey were scheduled for a re-evaluation after the break.\n\nThe Suns will be without Dillon Brooks, who will serve a one-game suspension Thursday for picking up his 16th technical foul in a Feb. 11 loss to defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n\"He said I'm playing victim all the time. When I don't play the victim, I'm a bad guy. Choose one.\"\n\nDillon Brooks on a conversation with lead official James Williams during Suns loss to OKC.\n\nNow has 16 technical fouls. If it stands, he'll receive 1-game suspension. #Suns pic.twitter.com/XL1A9QRal0\n\n— Duane Rankin (@DuaneRankin) February 12, 2026\n\n“He knows his technical situation,” Suns general manager Brian Gregory said Feb. 18. “We've had plenty of sit-downs and talks. He also knows how important he is for us to be on the court. So, I think with that, I think he understands exactly where he's at.”\n\nBrooks leads the NBA in technical fouls this season. Each two additional technical fouls will result in a one-game suspension (18th, 20th, 22nd, etc.).\n\nJalen Green isn’t on the injury report as he participated in workouts and improved his conditioning during the All-Star break.\n\n“Yeah, he's in a good spot right now,\" Gregory said. \"You know, injuries, unfortunately, are part of this league, and he's done an unbelievable job. His spirit on a daily basis in terms of attacking the rehab, attacking the recovery, attacking the workouts has been spot on from Day 1.”\n\nGreen has played only seven games this season, mostly due to a right hamstring injury, after playing every game the previous two seasons with the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe explosive 6-4 guard played in two of Phoenix’s last three games before the break after suffering a left hip contusion Jan. 30 against Cleveland that sidelined him three games.\n\nCole Anthony remains listed on the team’s injury report as “not with team.” Sources informed The Arizona Republic last week the Suns were looking to waive Anthony.\n\nThe Suns acquired Amir Coffey and Anthony from the Milwaukee Bucks in a three-team deal sent Nick Richards to the Chicago Bulls and Nigel Hayes-Davis to the Bucks before the Feb. 5 trade deadline.\n\nHave opinions about the current state of the Suns?

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA star Enes Kanter Freedom piled on to the often-conservative criticism of freestyle skiing great Eileen Gu on Wednesday.\n\nGu, whose mother is Chinese, was born in San Francisco but is representing China for the second straight Winter Olympics.\n\nPolitics: Trump's Latest Epstein Denial Has Critics Asking New Questions\n\nShe has earned China two silver medals in the Milan Cortina Games with the halfpipe up next. She won two golds and a silver in 2022. She has vaulted to international fame as an athlete and sometimes a model, reportedly earning tens of millions of dollars a year ― a chunk of which she has received from the Chinese government.\n\nBut as in the last Winter Olympics, Gu has gotten heat for her choice, though it should be noted that several U.S.-born athletes compete for other countries. Brazil’s Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, who was born in Oslo but has a Brazilian mother, has been widely celebrated during the Games for representing a country other than his birthplace. Gu’s defenders have suggested that racism and Sinophobia are factors in why she is being treated differently.\n\n“I’m just going to say it. She’s a traitor,” Freedom told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday. “She was born in America. She was raised in America, lives in America, and chooses to compete against her own country for, literally, the worst human rights abuser on the planet, China. She built her fame in a free country, and then chooses to represent an authoritarian regime.”\n\nKanter Freedom: Eileen Gu Is a traitor. She was born in America and chooses to compete against her own country. pic.twitter.com/gAh4YbrFpt\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) February 18, 2026\n\nThe former center, who played for the Utah Jazz, New York Knicks and other teams in the NBA from 2011 to 2022, added “Freedom” to his name when he became a U.S. citizen in 2021. The former Turkish citizen was outspoken against the Turkish government and had his passport canceled by the country in 2017. He often speaks out against human rights abuses in China.\n\nBefore the Games, Gu defended her choice to represent China.\n\nPolitics: Money And Power Converge As CBS Becomes Trump State Media\n\n“The U.S. already has the representation,” Gu said, per Newsweek. “I like building my own pond.”\n\nShe also dismissed speculation that she chose China because the financial windfall was potentially greater.\n\n“I’m glad that there’s enough money in the sport now for people to think that’s a consideration,” Gu said.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nEven Vice President JD Vance weighed in about Gu’s decision, starting off diplomatically but eventually throwing some shade her way.\n\nAsked by Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on Tuesday if the status of the San Francisco-born athlete should be “changed,” the veep replied: “Well, look, I have no idea what her status should be. I think that’s ultimately up to the Olympics Committee. I won’t pretend to wade into that.”\n\nPolitics: Homeland Security Flack Tricia McLaughlin Set To Leave Trump Administration\n\n“I certainly think that somebody who grew up in the United States of America, who benefited from our education system, from the freedoms and liberties that make this country a great place, I would hope that they want to compete with the United States of America,” he added.\n\n“So, I’m going to root for American athletes, and I think part of that is people who identify themselves as Americans. That’s who I’m rooting for this Olympics,” Vance said.\n\nFox News Host Asks Vance If U.S.-Born Olympian Should Lose ‘Status’ Skiing For China\n\nOlympian's *** Confession Spreads To Another Sport In Wild 'Late Show' Send-Up\n\nItaly Taunts U.S. In Oh-So-Familiar Style After Winning Speedskating Team Event",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Speedskater Andrea Giovannini knew he was going to celebrate with Steph Curry's “Night night” celebration if he could help Italy beat the favored U.S. in the men’s team pursuit final at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Tuesday.\n\nGiovannini just didn't want to tell teammates Davide Ghiotto and Michele Malfatti ahead of time, in case things didn't go well. Not a problem. The Italians claimed the gold medal by finishing 4 1/2 seconds faster than the American world record-holders, and that margin was so large that Giovannini pulled his two white-gloved hands together and pressed them to the side of his head at the close, just the way NBA star Curry does.\n\n“The last lap, we were in control,” Giovannini said, “and I was just waiting for that finish line to emulate Steph.”\n\nGiovannini said he remembered watching on TV during the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics when Curry did his signature move after one of his late 3-pointers sealed a 98-87 victory for the U.S. against France to win gold in men's basketball.\n\n“Emblematic of having cold blood,” Giovannini said.\n\nSo a couple of days ago, Giovannini was chatting with his Olympic roommate, speedskating teammate Francesco Betti, and told him he planned to go with the “Night night.”\n\n“It happened,” Giovannini said. “I was worried I would forget.”\n\nOne of the other team pursuit gold medalists, Ghiotto, said later he hadn't seen what Giovannini did — and actually wasn't even sure what the whole thing was about, because he wasn't aware of who Curry is.\n\nHearing that, Giovannini joked: “Tonight we’ll watch a basketball game.”\n\nThe American trio of Casey Dawson, Emery Lehman and Ethan Cepurian — who got the bronze in the event at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and set the world record in November — weren't aware of Giovannini's gesture.\n\n“It’s better,” Lehman said with a big laugh, “than getting two middle fingers from the Russians four years ago.”\n\nAP Sports Writer Daniella Matar contributed to this report.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "An NBA writer believes the Golden State Warriors' new 7-foot-2 center isn't as good as advertised.",
    "fullText": "Warriors' recently acquired $60 million star named among NBA's most overrated players originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors may not have paired Stephen Curry with the star he envisioned playing alongside (Giannis Antetokounmpo), but a star is a star at this point.\n\nThe Warriors needed to add another high-caliber contributor to the roster after Jimmy Butler’s ACL injury, and they did just that before the Feb. 5 trade deadline. However, Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz believes the Dubs recently acquired 7-foot-2 star is among the most overrated players in the NBA right now.\n\n“Kristaps Porziņgis has the highest swing rating of any player on this list and is still a productive player when he's on the floor,” Swartz wrote Monday. “Therein lies the problem for the 30-year-old.”\n\n“Porziņgis continues to be plagued by injuries and is currently sidelined with left Achilles tendinitis. He's played just 17 total games for the Atlanta Hawks all season and just five since November. Porzingis was averaging just 45.4 healthy games over the last eight years coming into this season. Injuries have unfortunately robbed him of a potential Hall of Fame career.”\n\n“That didn't stop the Golden State Warriors from making Porziņgis their big trade deadline acquisition, however.”\n\nAccording to Swartz, Porzingis is the 4th most overrated player in the league right now. While Porzingis is unreliable at this stage of his career, he isn’t overrated. The former New York Knicks star is simply injury-prone, making it challenging for him to find a rhythm on the hardwood.\n\nIf Porzingis were regularly active and underperforming on both ends, Swartz would have a legitimate case for including the former lottery pick in the overrated category.\n\nHopefully, for the Warriors’ sake, Porzingis doesn’t experience any devastating injuries moving forward.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors sign 6-foot-5 former Lakers guard to assist Stephen Curry",

    "fullText": "China is a huge market for the NBA, and that is nothing new. Among the league’s international audiences, few countries can go toe to toe with the second-most populous nation in the world. Because of that, the NBA makes sure to establish its presence on the ground every single year. The face of the league, LeBron James, understands this as well.\n\nJames has been to China 15 times so far for his Nike promo tour. It’s also not been that long since his last visit, with the King traveling to China as recently as 2025 to promote his “Forever King” tour, to promote his LeBron 23 shoes. Was it also a farewell visit? One last visit to China?\n\nNot according to James, who, during media availability at All-Star Weekend, admitted that he would like to make another trip to the East.\n\n“To all my fans and people over there it’s always been great,” James stated. “Always welcomed me and my friends and family in open arms. I’ve always appreciated it, they’re be another opportunity for me to go over there at some point.”\n\nJames has remained coy on his relationship with China over the years. He found himself in hot water in 2019 when he went against Daryl Morey’s statement on China.\n\n“I don’t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.”\n\nSince then James has returned to China on a semi-regular basis as he did before the incident as well. So, it’s safe to say he’s welcome in the country to quite a fair extent.\n\nEven if James retires from the NBA after the 2025-26 season, as some believe he will, Nike, which has supported him throughout his career, would still look to capitalize on his popularity in China. Both James and the iconic American brand remain hugely popular there, despite the political tensions between the two countries.\n\nAt the same time, it looks as though James has another country in his mind he would love to visit. And that’s Israel.\n\nIn the same presser in L.A., James was asked about his thoughts on the Middle-Eastern country, and his reply showed that he really wanted to go there. “If I have fans over there — I’ve never been there — I hope you follow my career, I hope I inspire people over there.”\n\n“Not only to be great in sports, but to be better in general in life, hopefully someday I can make it over there,” the Lakers icon added. “I’ve heard great things and I appreciate the question.”\n\nFor now, though, James cannot travel anywhere that far from home. Crunch time in the season is here with the All-Star break nearly over, and his focus is solely on possibly ending his career with a fifth ring.\n\nThe post LeBron James Admits To Wanting To Visit China “At Some Point” appeared first on The SportsRush.",

Their viewership and brand is much stronger than that over the NBA.\n\nFor reference, the NFL’s Christmas Day performance saw a 27.5M viewership for one game versus the NBA’s 5.5M. It’s clear the NFL product is much more valuable. Is it worth a fuss over $450M margin?\n\nAfter all, the league is doing plenty well both in the owners’ and player’s pockets.

Instead, he focused on what sports can represent at a broader level.\n\nAfter watching the NBA All-Star Game and Team USA compete at the Winter Olympics, Obama posted a message about the impact of sports.\n\nHe tweeted: “Watching the NBA All-Star game and Team USA at the Winter Olympics, it’s clear that sports — just like music and art — still have the power to bring us together, build community, and remind us of our common humanity.”\n\nObama compared sports to music and art, suggesting they share a unique ability to connect people across different backgrounds.\n\nHis message centered on unity and shared experience rather than competition.\n\nAll-Star weekend, which features players from across the league and around the world, provided a fitting backdrop for that reflection.\n\nMichelle Obama also posted on social media after attending the game with Barack.\n\n“My favorite teammates on and off the court,” she wrote.\n\nHer caption accompanied a photo of the couple courtside at the Intuit Dome, adding a lighthearted note to the evening.\n\nThe post quickly drew attention from fans, many of whom enjoyed seeing the former president and first lady taking in the event together.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron jokes as Victor Wembanyama takes center stage at NBA All-Star Game\n\n‘Who is that?’ – Anthony Edwards’ Cristiano Ronaldo moment at NBA All-Star Game goes viral\n\nMetta Sandiford-Artest claims he can’t travel to Australia due to 2004 Malice at the Palace incident",

    "fullText": "In the NBA, star power isn’t just a luxury — it’s a signal of stability, identity and sustained excellence. One of the clearest ways to measure that consistency is by tracking consecutive seasons with at least one player selected to the NBA All-Star Game. While a single All-Star appearance can reflect a breakout season or an extraordinary individual performance, long active streaks tell a much deeper story about organization direction, roster construction and competitive relevance over time.\n\nTeams that maintain extended All-Star streaks rarely do so by accident. These runs often emerge from a combination of smart drafting, effective player development and the ability to either retain or attract elite talent. In many cases, they also reflect continuity — stable coaching systems, clearly defined roles and front offices that prioritize long-term contention over short-term fluctuation. Sustained All-Star representation can also shape perception across the league, reinforcing a franchise’s reputation as a destination for high-level players and meaningful competition.\n\nAt the same time, these streaks reveal the shifting landscape of the league itself. Some franchises extend long-standing traditions of excellence, while others represent newer waves of ascendance powered by emerging superstars. Rebuilding teams may appear briefly before dropping off, while contenders often sustain visibility year after year. Ranking teams by active All-Star streaks offers a snapshot not just of individual recognition, but of which organizations have successfully positioned themselves to matter — consistently — in one of the most competitive talent environments in professional sports.\n\n11 years\nBoston’s streak reflects a franchise that rarely dips out of elite relevance. Over the past decade-plus, they’ve consistently developed or acquired star-level talent capable of representing the Eastern Conference every season. The continuity speaks to strong roster building and a culture that prioritizes high-end two-way players.

    "fullText": "In today’s NBA, greatness isn’t just measured in championships and MVP trophies — it’s also reflected in career earnings that tell the story of longevity, dominance, and timing. The list of the highest NBA career earners of all time is more than a financial ranking; it’s a snapshot of an era where superstar impact and league revenue have grown side by side. As television deals expanded, the salary cap exploded, and max contracts reached historic heights, the league’s elite were positioned to benefit like never before.\n\nAt the very top sits LeBron James, whose career earnings surpass half a billion dollars — a staggering figure that mirrors his two decades of excellence. Close behind are generational talents like Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, players who not only defined their era but helped reshape the modern game. From revolutionary shooting to unstoppable scoring versatility, their contracts reflect both production and influence.\n\nWhat makes this list compelling is how it blends sustained superstardom with strategic career moves. Long-term extensions, supermax deals, and loyalty to franchises all play a role. These numbers represent more than paydays — they symbolize trust from organizations, global marketability, and consistent elite performance. In many ways, this ranking captures the business evolution of basketball just as much as it honors the players themselves.\n\nLeBron’s longevity and sustained dominance are simply unmatched. From his early days in Cleveland to championships in Miami, Cleveland again, and Los Angeles, he has maximized every contract with superstar-level performance. Even in his 20th-plus season range, he’s still producing at an elite level, proving that his earning power has mirrored his greatness on the court.\n\nDurant’s smooth scoring ability made him one of the most sought-after superstars of his era. His championships with Golden State, combined with MVP-level play throughout his career, positioned him for massive max contracts. Even after major injuries, his value never dipped, a testament to his pure offensive brilliance.\n\nCurry revolutionized basketball with his shooting range and off-ball movement. As the face of a dynasty in Golden State, he earned historic extensions that reflected both his impact and loyalty. His contracts symbolize how the modern NBA now prioritizes skill, spacing, and transformative talent.\n\nHarden’s offensive peak in Houston was one of the most statistically explosive stretches in league history. His ability to control tempo, draw fouls, and score in isolation made him a perennial MVP candidate. Those dominant years translated into massive contracts that cemented his financial legacy in the league.\n\nPaul has long been considered one of the greatest floor generals in NBA history. His leadership, mid-range mastery, and basketball IQ consistently elevated every team he joined. Even into his late 30s, teams valued his presence enough to keep him among the league’s highest earners.\n\nGeorge’s two-way versatility made him one of the most complete wings of his generation. Whether in Indiana, Oklahoma City, or Los Angeles, he has been a consistent All-Star presence. His max-level deals reflect the premium the NBA places on elite perimeter defenders who can also score at all three levels.\n\nLeonard built his career on quiet dominance and postseason excellence. From Finals MVP honors in San Antonio to delivering Toronto its first championship, his résumé speaks volumes. Even with load management and injuries, his championship pedigree secured him massive long-term deals.\n\nButler’s rise from late first-round pick to franchise leader is one of the league’s best development stories. His relentless competitiveness and playoff heroics elevated Miami into multiple deep postseason runs. Those performances solidified his reputation as a max-contract cornerstone.\n\nLillard’s loyalty to Portland defined much of his career and led to record-setting extensions. Known for clutch shooting and fearless range, he became one of the league’s most respected leaders. His earning total reflects both individual brilliance and the financial power of long-term franchise commitment.\n\nDavis has consistently been one of the NBA’s most dominant two-way big men. His defensive versatility and inside scoring helped deliver a championship in Los Angeles. When healthy, he’s a franchise-altering force, and his contracts have reflected that elite impact.\n\nUltimately, the highest career earners in NBA history represent the intersection of talent, timing, and transformation within the league. Their earnings are a testament to sustained excellence and the NBA’s unprecedented financial growth. As the salary cap continues to rise, this list will evolve — but it will always be anchored by the legends who set the financial standard.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Highest NBA career earnings of all-time appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Anthony Edwards was named Most Valuable Player of the NBA All-Star Game as the USA Stars beat the USA Stripes 47-21.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves guard scored 32 points and added nine rebounds and three assists to claim the Kobe Bryant Trophy.\n\nIn the 75th edition of the NBA All-Star Game there was a change from the traditional Eastern Conference against Western Conference format.\n\nA new round-robin tournament consisted of four 12-minute games between two sides from the United States - one filled with young players and the other with veteran stars - and one group of international players.\n\nEdwards, 24, along with Oklahoma City Thunder's Chet Holmgren, each scored eight points as the Stars dominated the championship game while team-mate Tyrese Maxey of the Philadelphia 76ers scored nine.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" Edwards said of his MVP award. \"I love Minnesota, and I know Minnesota loves me. I said I wasn't going to put on a show for them but I gave them a show.\"\n\nThe Stripes missed their first 10 shots in the final as the younger Stars team raced into a 12-1 lead. The Stars later added a 15-0 run for a 33-9 advantage as the veterans were well beaten.\n\nNBA all-time scoring leader LeBron James, 41, who was making his 22nd appearance in the All-Star Game, added five for the Stripes.\n\nIn the round-robin opener at Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome, Edwards scored 13 points as the USA Stars beat the World team 37-35.\n\nYet he was afterwards keen to highlight the performance of San Antonio Spurs' Victor Wembanyama, with the Frenchman producing 14 points, six rebounds and three blocks in his side's defeat.\n\n\"I ain't going to lie, Wemby set the tone,\" said Edwards. \"He came out hard and we had to follow that. We had to pick it up and we did that.\"\n\nThe World team were without injured stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander while Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic combined for only two points, two rebounds and two assists.\n\nThey lost the third game 48-45 to the Stripes, meaning they were eliminated and the final would be a repeat of the second game, which the Stripes had won 42-40.\n\nThe new format was seen as a success after criticism of recent editions being lacklustre.\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama, who was courtside, said: \"I know a lot of people have been concerned about the All-Star Game, not seeing as much effort. But we saw it.\"",

    "fullText": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s rise in the NBA has unfolded in real time. When he entered the league in 2018, few viewed him as a future MVP. Yet he reached that level and captured a championship with the Oklahoma City Thunder along the way. Today, he is firmly among the league’s elite, and a major reason for that is the confidence with which he carries himself on and off the court.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was one of the starters in the All-Star game this weekend, where he spoke about his mindset. Now, there will be people chiming in and calling him a “foul baiter”, but his talent cannot be denied. In late game moments when the whole team appears to be nervous and rushing to get points, he remains calm, and that actually works.\n\nThe Thunder star is firmly of the belief that what happens today doesn’t matter tomorrow. So, in his mind, the only thing he cares about his getting better with each passing day.\n\nSpeaking about his style of play, the Canadian said, “I have the utmost confidence in my game. Everybody’s trying to speed it up. And I’m not Usain Bolt.”\n\nGilgeous-Alexander hasn’t been in many losing situations over the last two years, and when he has, he’s helped the Thunder wiggle its way out on several occasions. In “within ten-points” situations in the 2025-26 season, the Thunder have had a winning percentage of >85%. That shows that they rarely panic, and SGA being on the floor genuinely helps with that.\n\n“I’m not about to outrun anybody. I gotta slow down. It’s that simple. You run fast, I go slow,” Gilgeous-Alexander added.\n\nSGA is once again one of the favorites to win MVP this season. He is averaging 31.8 points, a stat line that, halfway through the regular season, highlights just how consistently dominant he has been. The Thunderas a whole have struggled a bit lately, with them losing the “#1 record in the NBA bragging rights” to the Detroit Pistons right before the All-Star break. They’re 42-14 and 5-5 in their last 10 games.\n\nThe Thunder have to improve, of course, but SGA needs to keep doing what he always does: be calm, believe in himself, and score points. It’s what makes him a front-runner for the best player in the league award.\n\nThe post Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Explains How “Utmost Confidence” in His Game Is Key to Late-Game Poise appeared first on The SportsRush.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 3-Point Contest at All-Star Weekend is typically an entertaining event, and this year was no different.\n\nThe event featured virtuoso shooting performances from both Devin Booker and Dame Lillard, and ultimately it was Lillard who came out victorious over Booker, despite the fact that he hasn’t played in a game all season after suffering a torn Achilles last season.\n\nThe contest delivered dramatics and entertainment. The only thing missing was the guy who is universally considered as the best shooter ever, Steph Curry.\n\nCurry has won the contest twice before (2015 and 2021), but he didn’t participate this year. The rest of the field won’t be so lucky next year though, as Curry vowed to return to compete in the contest in 2027 and bring some friends with him.\n\n\"One hundred percent,\" Curry said of his participation. \"I already scheduled it. We're gonna bring some people. Me, Dame [Damian Lillard], I'm gonna try to get Klay [Thompson], Dev [Devin Booker].\"\n\nWith two wins to his name, Curry needs one more win in the contest to enter a tie for the most all-time with Lillard, Larry Bird and Craig Hodges. All three of those guys won the contest on three separate occasions.\n\nCurry's participation would immediately make the event a must-see.

    "description": "OKC Thunder forward Chet Holmgren made his first NBA All-Star Game appearance on Sunday, and he helped his team win a tournament title.",
    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, CA — The sound of a television could be heard from a hallway inside Intuit Dome on Sunday night.\n\nIt came from a small visitors' locker room, where the USA Stars team was watching a broadcast of the NBA All-Star Game's round-robin tournament. The USA Stripes and World teams were facing off, and the outcome would decide if the Stars advanced to the championship round.\n\nTyrese Maxey drank some \"Cool Blue\" Gatorade on one side of the room. Jalen Johnson ate some chicken tenders from concessions on the other. And in the center was Chet Holmgren, who only wanted to feast his eyes on the TV and see if his first career All-Star appearance would continue.\n\n\"I think that's the one thing that's tough about having a three-team, team-off-and-team-on thing,\" Holmgren said of the event's new tournament format. \"We went back in the locker room for like 20 or 30 minutes while the other two teams were playing. We were kind of just chilling, sitting there and watching it.\"\n\nNBA All-Star Game highlights: Chet Holmgren, USA Stars win championship\n\nFortunately, Holmgren's night wasn't over. The World team lost, sending the Stars to the championship round thanks to a head-to-head tiebreaker. They then secured the title by earning a dominant 47-21 win over the Stripes.\n\nThe Thunder big man came off the bench during all three of his team's 12-minute games. It's a feeling that's unfamiliar to the 23-year-old pro, who has always been one of the brightest stars on every court he's touched.\n\nBut Holmgren stayed true to his usual brand of basketball, impacting the game on both ends while playing within the team. He racked up eight points, two rebounds and a game-high two blocks on 3-for-4 shooting from the field during the title game. And he did so in only six minutes.\n\n\"I think it was great,\" Holmgren said. \"Before, I didn't really know how it was supposed to go because I'd never gone through it. I was just kind of trying to feel out the game and play accordingly, and I think it went well. It was fun. ... I played a good brand of basketball.\"\n\nSunday's tournament isn't the biggest stage Holmgren has stepped onto. He helped OKC win its first NBA championship in franchise history last season, after all.\n\nStill, Holmgren couldn't help but to appreciate his surroundings as he got some 3s up during shootaround.\n\nStars such as Minnesota's Anthony Edwards and Detroit's Cade Cunningham are usually on the other end of the court. The side that's enemy territory. But they were right next to him this time, letting it fly and doing some pregame stretches.\n\nMore: Chet Holmgren's path to NBA All-Star Game began with bold claim and channeled ambition\n\n\"I just tried to take a moment to reflect on how cool of an opportunity this is,\" Holmgren said. \"I felt like I was pretty in the moment for the most part, just taking everything in.\"\n\nHolmgren took in plenty of other cool moments throughout the weekend.\n\nHe attended a Foot Locker event on Friday, where he held a sit-down interview and a meet-and-greet with fans. He participated in the Shooting Stars competition on Saturday, where he teamed up with Toronto's Scottie Barnes and former NBA player Richard Hamilton. And he even received a ring before Sunday's tournament to commemorate his All-Star selection.\n\nHolmgren says he didn't even know that last part was going to happen. But he'll happily add it to his growing collection of hardware.\n\n\"It's pretty sick, but I think I like our ring from last summer a little bit more,\" Holmgren said with a smirk.\n\nMore: OKC Thunder's Jared McCain responds to Jason Williams' criticism: 'Get to know me'\n\nJustin Martinez covers the Thunder and NBA for The Oklahoman.

    "fullText": "Boston Celtics superstar Jaylen Brown has expressed intrigue in pursuing combat sports such as UFC once his NBA days wind down.\n\nIn a recent interview, JB revealed he has contemplated stepping into the UFC Octagon or a boxing ring, drawing inspiration from his father Marselles Brown’s professional boxing background.\n\nBrown mentioned the appeal of high-profile exhibitions in boxing that attract non-traditional fighters and boost the sport’s visibility. At 223 pounds, Brown would probably be a heavyweight.\n\nBrown has already initiated conversations with UFC CEO Dana White about potential opportunities in mixed martial arts, though he emphasized that any such move would come after his basketball career.\n\nBoston Celtics G/F Jaylen Brown says he would like to partake in the UFC or boxing post career 🤔\n\n\"Maybe post part of my career, I would love to partake in something like UFC or even boxing. I've talked to Dana White about some stuff\"#NBAAllStar26 pic.twitter.com/sBQTgICKZM\n\n— COMBAT SPORTS TODAY (@CSTodayNews) February 15, 2026\n\nBrown’s been all over the headlines this year, as his 2025-26 season has been a dominant display.\n\nThrough 49 games, Brown has averaged 29.3 points per game, ranking fourth league-wide, alongside 6.9 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.0 steals, and 0.4 blocks in 34.2 minutes. His shooting splits stand at 48.3% from the field, 34.8% from three, and 77.5% from the free-throw line.\n\nJB has been on a tear, scoring 20 or more points in 16 straight games. Earlier peaks included a 50-point explosion on January 3 and consistent double-digit rebounding outings. These career-high marks in scoring, rebounding, and assisting reflect his evolution into a more complete offensive force, helping Boston maintain a strong position heading into the All-Star break.\n\nNikola Jokic Talks Jaylen Brown’s MVP Candidacy",

    "fullText": "Over the last couple of years, LeBron James has gotten plenty of criticism regarding the path his son Bronny has taken with his own basketball career. The elder James made it clear that his dream was to play in the NBA alongside his son, and in 2024, the younger James was taken by the Lakers with the No. 55 pick in the draft.\n\nThe two members of the James clan played in the same game at the same time in the Lakers' first contest of the 2024-25 season. Since then, the younger James has mostly failed to prove that he's worthy of any real playing time in the NBA, which has led many to attack his father for allegedly funneling him into the league instead of letting him take his time to develop at a lower level.\n\nAt NBA All-Star Weekend on Saturday, former NBA guard and five-time champion Ron Harper was interviewed alongside his sons Ron Harper Jr. and Dylan Harper. Dylan Harper is a standout rookie with the San Antonio Spurs, while Ron Harper Jr. plays for the Boston Celtics.\n\nRon Harper was asked if he ever saw his kids following in his footsteps and playing in the NBA. He replied by throwing some serious shade at the elder James.\n\n“I’m not LeBron James. I’m not going to tell my kids what they have do.”\n\nDylan Harper, in particular, has helped the Spurs establish the second seed in the Western Conference and the third-best record in the league. The 6-foot-5, 215-pound Rutgers University product is averaging 10.9 points and 3.7 assists in 21.7 minutes a game and is part of a very potent backcourt rotation for San Antonio.\n\nThe younger James, meanwhile, has mustered just 2.2 points and 1.2 assists in 7.3 minutes a game and is shooting 40% from the field this season with Los Angeles. On Tuesday, when the Spurs defeated the Lakers 136-108, Dylan Harper had 15 points and six assists, while the younger James showed a bit of spark with 12 points on 5-of-10 shooting and six assists.\n\nThe elder James has another son, Bryce, who is currently a freshman at the University of Arizona and could enter this summer's NBA draft if he wishes to.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Ron Harper takes a shot at LeBron James regarding Bronny James",

    "fullText": "Teaming with LeBron James would be ‘special’ for Cavs’ Donovan Mitchell appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe idea of LeBron James returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers for one last dance would be appealing for star guard Donovan Mitchell.\n\nRumors of James uniting with his first NBA team to end his career has been circling around the league. The veteran star is going through his eighth season and counting with the Los Angeles Lakers but will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason.\n\nMitchell addressed those rumors during his interview on SiriusXM NBA Radio on Saturday. He is very open to the scenario, referring to the opportunity a special one if James decides to return to Cleveland for what can be his final season in the league.\n\n“As a Bron fan, to be able to be a teammate, obviously that would be special,” Mitchell said Saturday during an interview with SiriusXM NBA Radio.\n\n“Yeah, man, it’s LeBron James. But at the end of the day, that’s not my focus. I’m not here to worry about that. I know I’m going to get asked about that a bunch all weekend … But my focus is, we just traded for James Harden, Dennis Schröder, Keon Ellis. Let’s try to find a way to get a ring.”\n\nHere’s Donovan Mitchell’s thoughts on the rumors that LeBron could finish his career in Cleveland@TermineRadio | @Jumpshot8\n\nClick here for more All-Star coverage – https://t.co/j3RPgmlH7e pic.twitter.com/lm2My2U5HQ\n\n— SiriusXM NBA Radio (@SiriusXMNBA) February 15, 2026\n\nDonovan Mitchell is right to keep his focus on the current season. The Cavaliers just traded Darius Garland to the Los Angeles Clippers for James Harden, elevating their chances of being serious contenders for the remainder of the season.\n\nMitchell continues to excel as one of the best scorers in the league. Goin through his fourth season with the Cavaliers, he is averaging 29 points, 5.9 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game throughout 51 appearances. He is shooting 48.7% from the field, including 37.6% from beyond the arc, and 85.3% from the free-throw line.\n\nCleveland has a 33-21 record on the season, holding the 4th spot in the Eastern Conference standings. They are two games above the Toronto Raptors and 3.5 games above the Philadelphia 76ers. However, they trail the New York Knicks by one game and the Boston Celtics by 1.5 games.\n\nRolling with five consecutive wins, the Cavaliers remain on hiatus until the All-Star Weekend festivities come to a close. They will resume action at home when they host the Brooklyn Nets on Feb. 19 at 7 p.m. ET.",

He announced last month he was sitting this one out for \"a bunch of reasons.\"\n\nHowever, McClung did decide to show off the four dunks he would have brought to the contest had he participated. Here they are:\n\nThe four dunks @macmcclung37 would’ve done this year at this year’s dunk contest 🔥\n\nWhich one was your favorite? Text DUNK to 69097 to vote! pic.twitter.com/lrtNdcoFek\n\n— Team VKTRY (@TeamVKTRY) February 15, 2026\n\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, the McClung dunks are both more interesting and more impressive, though we should also note we are only watching the video McClung's camp decided to record. Half the difficulty of the dunk contest is being able to pull off acrobatic moves on command, with a panel of NBA veterans to somberly shake their heads at you if you fail.\n\nThat said, McClung certainly has the benefit of the doubt given that he has landed 12 such dunks in the actual competition.\n\nWhat does this all mean for the dunk contest? It's certainly not the best look that its three-time champion responded to the actual competition with a superior group of dunks, but it's hardly the contest's biggest problem.\n\nThe contest has alternated from dying to watchable for the last decade and a half or so. When there's a McClung, an Aaron Gordon or Zach LaVine, the audience has something to grab onto. When there isn't, you certainly start to wonder why all this pageantry is put into what is essentially four lesser-known players trying to cosplay as stars. It's been a long time since LaVine and Gordon faced off in 2016, and even longer since Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins were doing it.\n\nMaybe that's harsh, but we saw how full that arena was on Saturday.",

    "description": "The Brooklyn Nets moved up to 26th in NBA.com's power rankings heading into the All-Star Break.",
    "fullText": "The Brooklyn Nets have not been playing the way they were hoping for since the calendar turned to January, but the good news is that the All-Star Break should serve as a reset of sorts. Brooklyn dealt with some injuries heading into the All-Star Break, specifically to forward Michael Porter Jr., but the Nets are slightly moving up in the power rankings prior to the Break.\n\n\"The Nets held onto Michael Porter Jr. at the deadline, a possible indication that they intend to be competitive in the 2026-27 season (with no control of their ’27 first-round pick),\" John Schuhmann wrote for NBA.com. Schuhmann ranked the Nets 26th in his latest power rankings pointing to the fact that Brooklyn is still regarded as one of the worst teams in the league despite the fact that they didn't trade Porter away.\n\n\"They added some second-rounders by helping teams duck the luxury tax and decided that Cam Thomas would be one of the players they waived to create the requisite roster space,\" Schuhmann continued on his view of what Brooklyn did at the deadline before noting how the Nets are committing to playing the rookies more. \"Brooklyn now ranks second (behind Charlotte) in the percentage of its minutes (29%) that have come from rookies.\"\n\nWhen Schuhmann wrote this version of his power rankings, the Nets had not yet played the Chicago Bulls or Indiana Pacers at home prior to the All-Star Break coming around. Brooklyn was able to beat the Bulls 123-115 on Feb. 9, but the Nets dropped the ball against the Pacers on Feb. 11 as they lost 115-110 despite leading by as many as 18 points in the contest.\n\nUltimately, the Nets have 29 games left to play for the rest of the season and with all of the talk surrounding the Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards when it comes to tanking, Brooklyn seems to be sticking to their usual rotation when those players are healthy. However, with the Nets having the fifth-worst record in the NBA heading into All-Star Break, it will be interesting to see if the team gravitates towards playing the younger players more down the stretch.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nets Wire: Nets rank 26th in NBA.com power rankings heading into All-Star Break",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStar guard Luka Doncic has missed the last four games for the Los Angeles Lakers due to a left hamstring strain.\n\nThe injury placed his status for the 2026 NBA All-Star game in doubt, but it sounds like that doubt can now be erased.\n\nWhile speaking with media members at All-Star weekend, Doncic revealed that he’s feeling better and plans to play a little bit, at least.\n\n“I feel pretty good. I’ve been working to get back,” Doncic said. “Obviously I wanted to play the last game, but it wasn’t possible. I was almost there. So I think I will play a little bit.”\n\nTechnically, playing in the exhibition could be a good way for Doncic to ease himself back into action, though he shouldn’t be expected to play many minutes, given the injury.\n\nIt will be the sixth career All-Star appearance for Doncic, who was selected as a starter for the game.\n\nOn the season, Doncic has appeared in 42 games for the Lakers and is averaging 32.8 points, 8.6 assists, 7.8 rebounds and 1.4 steals per performance.\n\nVictor Wembanyama sends clear message about being the next face of the NBA\n\nV.J.

    "description": "Following the three-team format that the NBA is utilizing, who makes this year's fantasy All-Star team?",
    "fullText": "The All-Star break is a great opportunity for teams to reset. With less than two months until the playoffs, players get a chance to recover from nagging injuries and coaches can reset mentally before the final stretch of a lengthy regular season.\n\nFantasy managers get the opportunity to do the same. A week off from scouring the waiver wire as soon as you wake up. The fantasy playoffs in many leagues will start March 2, which means there are only a couple weeks left until the postseason. Start making moves now to maximize your games played during your playoffs.\n\nWaiver wire adds can push your team to a championship, but you can only be in that situation if your stars are healthy and dominating. For this year’s fantasy All-Stars, I went with players that have been both excellent and available. The games played minimum is set at 35, so roughly two-thirds of a player’s possible games played. That led to some studs not making the cut, such as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid and Austin Reaves, even if they have all been incredible and can be difference-makers down the stretch if healthy.\n\nUsing the NBA’s new All-Star roster format of Team World, Team USA (old guys) and Team USA (young guys), we have our 24 fantasy All-Stars. Having a team with a few of these guys likely means you’re sitting near the top of your standings and preparing for the postseason (unless you have some ridiculous bad luck, which happens in fantasy).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Jokic headlines Team World. He missed about a month with a knee injury, which was unfortunate, but he is back to dominating already. He has been the best player in fantasy basketball of the 2020s, which hasn’t changed this season.\n\nThe reigning MVP missed the final five games before the All-Star break, but he only missed two games prior to that and has been dominant all season. His counting stats are slightly down from last season, but he has been even more efficient.\n\nSan Antonio has managed Wemby’s minutes for most of the season, but he has still been able to replicate his production from last season while being even more efficient. He has the Spurs just three games out of first in the West.\n\nDoncic was still incredible last season, but after a tumultuous year for him, he has gotten back to producing like he did during the 2023-24 season. LeBron James has been better recently, but both he and Austin Reaves have missed time this year. The Lakers are 5th in the West because of how dominant Doncic has been.\n\nMurray is making his first All-Star appearance this weekend, and he has also had the best fantasy season of his career. He is averaging career highs in points, rebounds, assists and three-pointers per game while also posting the best field goal percentage of his career. Everyone else in Denver has missed significant time this year, but Murray has kept them afloat.\n\nAfter struggling during the 2024-25 season, Markkanen bounced back in a big way this year. He’s averaging career highs in points, assists and steals in what has been arguably the best statistical season of his career. Hopefully we’ll get to see him keep it up down the stretch of this season.\n\nWith Fred VanVleet (knee) sidelined for the season, Sengun has stepped up as the primary facilitator in Houston. He is averaging career highs in assists, steals and blocks, which has helped him lead the Rockets to the 4th-best record in the West.\n\nIn his second season, Sarr has taken drastic strides on both ends of the floor. His field goal percentage is up over 10 percent from last year, and he is posting career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. He’s going to be a fantasy star for a long time. Unfortunately, he’s set to miss some time with a hamstring injury.\n\nThe most (pleasantly) surprising thing about Leonard cracking this list is that he has played enough games. He has missed some time, but he has been available for most of the year and has been playing some of the best basketball of his career. He is averaging career highs in points and three-pointers per game while also shooting the best free throw percentage of his career.\n\nMitchell is averaging a career high in points per game to go with the best field goal percentage of his career. The Cavs are 17-5 over their last 22 games, and Mitchell will look to take his team further in the playoffs with his new backcourt partner James Harden.\n\nThe man that has singlehandedly been keeping the Warriors afloat in recent years just keeps on getting it done. He missed the final five games entering the All-Star break but has been mostly available this season. Surprise, surprise, he’s leading the league in triples per game again.\n\nHarden’s 25.0 points per game this year are his highest average since the 2019-20 season, when he led the league with 34.3 points per game. He’s not that MVP caliber player that he once was, but he has had an excellent year and will look to keep that going with the Cavs down the stretch of this season.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to matter what jersey KD is wearing. He’s going to put up an efficient 25 points per game. He’s only missed five games this season, which is impressive at 37 years old. Durant is clearly still one of the best scorers in the NBA.\n\nMPJ’s value in Denver deteriorated, which led to him being shipped to Brooklyn for Cam Johnson. This is the first time in his career that he has been a top scoring option, and he has taken advantage of the opportunity, averaging career highs in points, assists and three-pointers per game.\n\nBridges’ usage is down this season, but he is posting a career high in assists per game while also averaging his most steals per game since his second year in the league. He has cooled down in recent weeks, but he’s done enough over the course of the season to make this list.\n\nIf White’s field goal percentage wasn’t below 40 percent for the first time in his career, we’d be looking at White as a top-10 player in fantasy basketball this season. He is averaging career highs in points, assists, steals and blocks. Boston is 2nd in the East entering the All-Star break, and White has helped them have success without Jayson Tatum.\n\nSomehow, Maxey just keeps getting better. He is averaging career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and three-pointers per game. The 76ers are officially his team, though the reemergence of Joel Embiid will give them a chance to really make some noise in the East. We’re officially in fantasy superstar status for Maxey.\n\nMurphy has been one of the lone bright spots in New Orleans this season. He is averaging career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and three-pointers per game, though that hasn’t been enough to make this team competitive. Hopefully this right shoulder injury won’t keep him sidelined for the rest of this season.\n\nEdwards seems to improve on something every season, but this year he simply became a better scorer. His rim, mid-range and three-point percentage are all the best marks of his career, which had led to a career-high in points per game.\n\nToronto has been much better as a team this season, and Barnes has been a big part of that. He’s having the most efficient scoring season of his career while still stuffing the stat sheet across the board. There aren’t many players in the league that are more tailored for fantasy basketball than Barnes.\n\nJohnson made a huge leap last season, but he has somehow done it again this year. He’s second in the league in both double-doubles and triple-doubles while also averaging a bunch of career highs across the board. Atlanta handed him the keys by dealing Trae Young to Washington, and Johnson has taken advantage.\n\nDetroit has the fewest losses in the league entering the All-Star break, and Cunningham has been at the center of it all. The efficiency has been average, but he has poured in the counting stats across the board. He may not win the award, but there is a reason Cade is in the middle of the MVP race.\n\nAfter only playing 32 games last season, Holmgren has barely missed time this year and has been excellent for fantasy managers. He’s averaging career highs in points and rebounds per game while also ranking in the top-five in blocks per game.\n\nIf anyone saw this list during the preseason, George would be the biggest surprise, but he has been that good. He has taken a monster leap forward on offense after being behind Isaiah Collier in the rotation to end last season. George was one of the best late-round picks this year, and he should continue to dominate when he returns from this ankle injury.",

    "description": "My 2026 NBA Slam Dunk Contest predictions and NBA picks for the event, featuring Carter Bryant, Jaxson Hayes, Keshad Johnson, and Jase Richardson.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest is a far cry from the days of Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, and Steve Francis battling it out.\n\nThis year’s field is full of lesser-known, lightly used players, so finding betting value in tonight's Slam Dunk Contest predictions requires a closer look.\n\nThat’s exactly what I’ve done with my NBA picks for Saturday, February 14, featuring Miami Heat forward Keshad Johnson.\n\nBefore wagering on the Slam Dunk Contest, be sure to familiarize yourself with the latest rules for the 2026 edition:\n\nFour players will compete in a two-round competition.\n\nFive judges will score each dunk based on a score ranging from 40 to 50.\n\nThe two dunkers with the highest combined scores from their first two dunks advance to the finals.\n\nThe final round will consist of two dunks by each dunker, with the highest composite score being crowned the champion.\n\nIn the event of a tie, there will be one additional round of dunks. If the event is still tied, then the judges will be empowered to declare a winner by majority vote.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Carter Bryant is the favorite in this field of relative unknowns. The 6-foot-6 rookie wing was taken 14th overall by the San Antonio Spurs largely because of his explosive athleticism.\n\nBryant boasts a 39.5-inch vertical, but he hasn’t seen much playing time in San Antonio, and there isn’t much game footage of him dunking. As a result, it’s hard to see much value at his current price.\n\nJaxson Hayes is an intriguing entrant, but there are reasons for skepticism. Historically, taller players have struggled in this competition (Dwight Howard being a notable exception), and Hayes isn’t exactly positioned as a fan favorite.\n\nThe 7-footer plays for the Los Angeles Lakers and was recently suspended one game for pushing a mascot. He also dealt with a domestic violence case earlier in his career. All things considered, this is a pass for me.\n\nKeshad Johnson is another explosive wing who has seen limited minutes with the Miami Heat.\n\nStill, the 6-foot-6 forward boasts a ridiculous 42-inch vertical, and some of his in-game dunks this season have been truly eye-popping...\n\nMy pick to win the NBA Dunk contest. 🏀🏆\n\nKeshad Johnson +320pic.twitter.com/LrQWUVP7ST\n\n— Andrew Caley (@Covers_Caley) February 13, 2026\n\nJase Richardson is the best storyline in the field. He carries the longest odds in this competition, even if there’s no true long shot. The 6-foot-1 rookie guard has seen limited minutes with the Orlando Magic this season.\n\nThe intrigue? He’s the son of two-time Slam Dunk champion Jason Richardson.\n\nRichardson appears to have inherited his dad’s leaping ability, and don’t be surprised if he pays homage to some of his father’s iconic dunks. At this price, there’s legitimate value.\n\nIt was a close call between Richardson and Johnson for me, but there’s more evidence of Johnson throwing down explosive dunks in actual NBA games.\n\nI’ve always believed that great in-game dunkers tend to translate well to this competition — think Vince Carter or, more recently, Derrick Jones Jr.\n\nBoasting an insane vertical, I’m expecting some jaw-dropping slams from Johnson on Saturday night.\n\nBest bet: Keshad Johnson to win (+320 at bet365)\n\nMichael Jordan, Jason Richardson, Nate Robinson, Zach LaVine, and Mac McClung are the only players in history to win the Slam Dunk Contest in back-to-back years.\n\nAt age 18, Kobe Bryant is the youngest player to win the Slam Dunk Contest (1997).\n\nJohn Wall is the last player to make an All-Star team and win the Slam Dunk Contest in the same year (2014).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "title": "NBA All-Star 2026: 76ers rookie VJ Edgecombe sets tone for the weekend with Rising Stars performance",
    "description": "Edgecombe's performance was a timely reminder of the 20-year-old's value as a scorer in Philadelphia this season.",
    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, CA — With both arms outstretched as he walked away triumphantly, it was only fitting that 76ers rookie VJ Edgecombe — after exploding for 17 out of a possible 40 points for Team Carter in the semis of the Rising Stars Challenge— sealed Friday night’s All-Star festivities at the free-throw line in the final versus Team Melo.\n\n“There was no pressure,” Edgecombe said after being named tournament MVP following the 25-24 win. “Free throws, man. I just try to be dialed in, try to be focused at the line. Free throws are precious. Obviously tonight, we needed them to win the game. I just focused and made them.”\n\nWith 23 points across both Rising Star games, Edgecombe’s efficient performance was a timely reminder of the 20-year-old’s value as a scorer in Philadelphia this season.\n\nThere are some natural efficiency roadblocks that he’ll need to iron out — his 105.5 points per 100 shot attempts place him in the 34th percentile among combo guards, and his .212 points per touch wedge him between Boston’s Hugo Gonzalez and Sacramento’s Nique Clifford — but his potential is through the roof. Edgecombe leads all rookies in touches per game, according to Second Spectrum, all while taking care of the ball (70th percentile in turnover rate). Statistically, the 76ers’ offense is better with him on the floor, a testament to his in-season development and the presence of All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey as a backcourt partner.\n\nOverall, Edgecombe’s value as a rookie can’t be understated, even on a team ripe with veterans. Through 50 games, Edgecombe is averaging 14.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. According to Stathead, there are 21 players this season posting those numbers with at least 2.5 win shares; Edgecombe and Cooper Flagg are the only rookies that comprise that list.\n\n[\nFriday night, despite the negative discourse that has surrounded All-Star weekend in recent years, was also a reminder that although much of the rookie conversations have been centered around Flagg and Kon Knueppel, Edgecombe is much more than a suitable consolation prize. From a sheer effort standpoint, it was clear the Philly guard wanted to compete at both ends of the floor, whether it was being in attack mode or being defensively engaged at the other end.\n\nAs a whole, the Rising Stars participants seemed to take the games seriously, a refreshing deviation from the norm. Spurs players Dylan Harper and Stephon Castle, members of Team Melo, were actively discussing the in-game events shortly after the final buzzer, almost as if this was a key regular-season game.\n\n“We wanted to compete,” Team Vince’s Jaylen Wells of the Grizzlies told Yahoo Sports. “Set the tone for the weekend, and a lot of guys on the team wanted to win. And the last one is money! We get paid!”\n\n“I hate losing,” Edgecombe added. “I really hate losing. It’s really a credit to my teammates. We all bought in.”\n\nHeading into the break, the 76ers (30-24) find themselves in a comfortable tier in the Eastern Conference, sixth place and just 3.5 games out of the top four. However, with Paul George in the midst of a 25-game suspension for a banned substance and superstar center Joel Embiid currently out with right knee management (he’ll be re-evaluated after the break), Edgecombe’s true value will surface. It’s rare for rookies to be depended on for pivotal stretch runs like Philadelphia is about to embark on, but outside of Maxey, Edgecombe is one of the few players on the roster who can create his shot and score from all three levels, in addition to creating plays for others.\n\n“It feels great to win the MVP of the Rising Stars game,” Edgecombe said. “But I’m focused. My next focus is the push after the All-Star break. After the break, we’ve just got to make a push. We’re still in the hunt for that playoff spot. Just got to stay together, keep hooping and trusting each other. I feel like we’re a dangerous team if we’re healthy. I stand on that.”",

    "title": "Stephen A. Smith: Lakers could go deep in playoffs thanks to LeBron",
    "description": "ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith believes a spry LeBron James will make the Lakers a real threat in this spring's NBA playoffs.",
    "fullText": "If anyone was thinking that LeBron James was starting to show signs of slippage this season at age 41, he reminded them on Thursday that he still has a decent amount of tread left on his tires.\n\nIn the Los Angeles Lakers' 124-104 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, he dropped 28 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds, giving him his first triple-double of this season. That stat line also made him the oldest player in NBA history to ever post a triple-double in a game.\n\nThat win gave the Lakers a 33-21 record going into the All-Star break. They're in fifth place in the Western Conference, and few people, if any, consider them to be true championship contenders right now. But on ESPN's \"First Take,\" Stephen A. Smith said that James' continued stellar play, when combined with the outstanding offensive production of Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves, could allow L.A. to make a deep playoff run this spring.\n\n\"When LeBron James is great, the Lakers have the potential to knock off some people,\" Smith said.\n\n\"… The fact of the matter is is that, if you've got three dudes that are playing at an elite level offensively, that puts more pressure on them (opposing teams) to produce offensively as well when they're going up against the Lakers, and everybody can't do that.\n\n\"… They could possibly make a little run, go deep into the Western Conference playoffs. That's what I'm looking at. That's why I'm excited when I see him like this at this age because I'm saying to myself, 'Yo, the Lakers could make it interesting if they play at an elite level offensively.\"\n\nJames is currently averaging 22 points, 5.8 rebounds and 7.1 assists a game, and while his 3-point shooting is a problem right now (he's making just 30.5% from 3-point range this season), he's still clearly a superstar-level player.\n\nDoncic, meanwhile, is leading the NBA in points, free throw attempts and free throw makes per game and is third in assists per game. Reaves, after missing over a month due to a gastrocnemius strain, is starting to get back into game shape and rhythm.\n\nThe Lakers seem a bit overdependent on their three stars to play well in order to win, and they have seldom had all three of them in uniform at the same time this season. But they are first in field-goal percentage and second in free throw attempts a game, and there have been times when they have shown glimpses of what they can be offensively when fully healthy.\n\nL.A. may not go all the way this season, but as Smith said, it could spoil the hopes of a couple of teams above it in the Western Conference standings this April and May.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Stephen A.

    "description": "The Steph vs Sabrina 3-point contest drove engagement but hasn’t been repeated since.",
    "fullText": "NBA and WNBA All-Star events have been going through a bit of a revamp in recent years. With increasing sponsorships, NBA salaries, and a decline in fan attention span, the NBA All-Star Game in particular has flopped in viewership and overall cultural resonance. It’s hard to get players to compete at 100% when they are afraid of being injured, and when there is little incentive to do so. Especially when it comes to events like the 3-point shooting contest, skills contest, or whatever other event the NBA tries to think up to change things up. WNBA players can be motivated by $25,000 prizes, of course, given their salaries are lower than those of NBA players, but NBA players are too well-compensated to really care about that kind of stuff anymore.\n\nA few years ago, the NBA made a huge step in re-engaging fans in All-Star events by holding a shooting contest between Stephen Curry and Sabrina Ionescu in 2024. While some “battle of the sexes” type events can quickly devolve into questionable territory, ripe for sexist online takes and poor analysis, this event was actually quite well done. Ionescu and Curry are two of the best shooters in the sport’s history, and also great friends, so there was a mutual respect that ran through the lead-up to the event and the event itself.\n\nSince it was a standard 3-point shooting contest, it wasn’t like Ionescu was at a huge disadvantage for being a woman. She was able to shoot from the WNBA three-point line (22 feet, 1.75 inches from the basket) if she wanted, but opted to use the standard NBA three-point line (23 feet, 9 inches from the basket) instead — a distance she is more than comfortable making shots from.\n\nAll of the prize money from this contest was being donated to charity, with Ionescu and Curry each pledging donations to their own personal foundations. The event was also in reaction to Sabrina Ionescu breaking the all-time 3-point contest record, NBA or WNBA, at the previous year’s WNBA All-Star Game. At the time, fans wondered how Ionescu would fare against the NBA’s best shooters — this event gave those fans what they wanted.\n\nThe event was a massive success, achieving the highest NBA All-Star Saturday viewership numbers in over five years, with over 5 million viewers. It outperformed the main event of the weekend, the actual All-Star Game, and viewership peaked during that event in particular. While Ionescu lost to Curry 29-26, her 26 points matched the actual winner of that year’s NBA 3-point shooting contest, and while she definitely didn’t need to gain any respect from the NBA contingent, she did.\n\nAfterward, many people expressed genuine interest and excitement in repeating the event. At the time, Caitlin Clark was still in college, but fans were frothing at the mouth at the idea of seeing her compete in a 3-point contest. There were ideas of Steph and Sabrina going up against Clark and another NBA shooting star like Damian Lillard. Yet, years later, none of that has come to fruition.\n\nIn fact, Ionescu or Clark have not competed in a 3-point contest since.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, Ionescu bowed out of the WNBA All-Star 3-point contest to focus more on the upcoming Paris Olympics the week after — super fair. That same year, Clark declined an invitation to the contest as well, saying she wanted to rest after playing for over a year of consecutive basketball.\n\nWhen it came to the following NBA All-Star game, in 2025, Clark declined an invitation from the NBA to participate. According to reporting from The Athletic, Clark wanted her first WNBA All-Star 3-point shooting contest to be in the WNBA.\n\nThe 2025 WNBA All-Star game was held in Clark’s WNBA home of Indianapolis, Indiana, where she plays with the Indiana Fever. A perfect spot to make her first appearance in the event, but those hopes were dashed as Clark suffered numerous injuries in the summer of 2025, leading to her missing most of the season and the All-Star game.\n\nNow, as we head into the 2026 NBA All-Star game, the hype of Steph vs Sabrina is two years old, and with nothing to replace it. Fans would surely show up in the same fashion for a Caitlin Clark-led 3-point contest, which would definitely help the NBA’s floundering All-Star Weekend viewership numbers. Yet, nothing of the sort has materialized in the nearly two years since Clark came onto the scene, and this year was likely impossible as the NBA battles with WNBA players over their next CBA.\n\nStill, it’s pretty wild that the NBA found a solid way to drive engagement, bring in the WNBA fanbase, and provide some tangible excitement for the All-Star events… and just hasn’t repeated it since. Add it to the list of self-inflicted L’s in the Adam Silver era.",

    "fullText": "Over the past decade, sustained success in the NBA has demanded far more than star talent alone. Championship contention now hinges on organizational stability, roster continuity, advanced analytics, and the ability to evolve with the modern pace-and-space era. The teams with the highest winning percentages over the last ten years represent more than statistical excellence — they embody strategic vision, player development, and resilience across multiple playoff cycles.\n\nMORE: NBA championship chances by SportsLine\n\nAt the forefront stands the Boston Celtics, whose identity has been defined by elite two-way play and a culture built on defensive accountability and adaptability. Close behind, the Milwaukee Bucks transformed sustained regular-season dominance into championship glory behind the generational force of Giannis Antetokounmpo. In the Western Conference, the Denver Nuggets emerged as a model of patience and precision, with Nikola Jokić orchestrating one of the league’s most efficient offenses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Golden State Warriors extended their era-defining dominance through innovation and championship experience, fueled by the transformative shooting of Stephen Curry. Rounding out the group, the Los Angeles Clippers consistently fielded deep, versatile rosters capable of competing with any contender on a nightly basis.\n\nTogether, these franchises illustrate what sustained excellence looks like in today’s league — not just flashes of brilliance, but a decade of strategic execution, adaptability, and relentless competitiveness.\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .648\nBoston has been one of the NBA’s most consistent contenders, built around elite two-way wings. With multiple deep playoff runs and an NBA championship during this stretch, the Celtics combined defensive intensity with offensive versatility. Their culture of toughness kept them among the league’s elite.\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .608\nThe Bucks’ dominance was anchored by Giannis Antetokounmpo’s MVP-caliber performances. Milwaukee secured an NBA title and regularly finished near the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Their combination of size, defense, and star power made them perennial threats.\n\nMORE: NBA points per game season leaders before the 2026 All-Star weekend\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .608\nBehind Nikola Jokić’s brilliance, Denver became a championship-winning franchise. The Nuggets’ balanced roster and efficient offense culminated in an NBA Finals victory during the decade. Their patience in team-building paid off in sustained success.\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .606\nGolden State continued its dynasty run with another championship in this span. Stephen Curry’s shooting and championship experience kept the Warriors in contention despite injuries and roster changes. Their offensive system remained one of the most feared in basketball.\n\nMORE: NBA 2026 Slam Dunk contest participants\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .572\nThe Clippers consistently fielded competitive teams built around elite wing talent. Though a championship eluded them, they remained strong playoff participants year after year. Their depth and defensive versatility kept them among the Western Conference’s toughest squads.\n\nUltimately, the teams with the highest winning percentages over the past decade reveal a clear pattern: long-term success is rarely accidental. It is built through smart roster construction, elite player performance, and organizational commitment to evolution. While each franchise followed a different path — from dynastic continuity to patient rebuilding — they all achieved the same outcome: sustained relevance in the league’s most competitive era. Their decade-long excellence sets the modern benchmark for what it truly means to contend year after year.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nOLYMPICS: Norway skier goes viral after displaying insane Winter Olympics speed\n\nSUPER BOWL: Ranking the last 10 NFL Super Bowl champions\n\nMLB: Texas Rangers’ Nolan Ryan jersey giveaway is a bloody mess\n\nMEDIA: Photos of potential suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance released by FBI\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break\n\nVIRAL: Norwegian Olympics star makes stunning girlfriend admission after winning bronze medal\n\nThe post NBA teams with the highest winning percentages over the last 10 years appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Utah Jazz have been fined $500,000 (£367,000) by the NBA for benching healthy players and \"compromising the integrity\" of the league.\n\nHead coach Will Hardy removed stars Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson Jr before the fourth quarter of their games against the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat this month.\n\nThe tactic, known as 'tanking', is used by coaches to improve draft position by fielding a non-competitive team and forfeiting victory.\n\nThe draft system means teams finishing lowest in the standings have the best chances of landing the top prospects.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers were also fined $100,000 (£73,000) for violating the player participation policy during their defeat against the Jazz on 4 February.\n\n\"Overt behaviour like this that prioritises draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" said NBA commissioner Adam Silver.\n\n\"Additionally, we are working with our competition committee and board of governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"\n\nA play-off push looks unlikely for both the Jazz, who are 13th in the Western Conference, and the Pacers, who sit 14th in the Eastern, and thoughts appear already to be turning to next season and how their roster will be assembled.\n\nUtah led by nine points in the fourth quarter of their meeting with Orlando on 8 February but went on to lose 120-117, while they beat Miami 115-111 two days later.\n\n\"Agree to disagree. Also, we won the game in Miami and got fined? That makes sense,\" Utah owner Ryan Smith posted on social media.\n\nHead coach Hardy defended his decision to bench Markkanen and Utah have also announced Jackson Jr will have season-ending surgery on his knee after this weekend's All-Star games.\n\n\"I sat Lauri because he was on a minutes restriction,\" Hardy said. \"So if our medical team puts a minutes restriction on Lauri, I'll try to keep Lauri healthy.\"\n\nUtah were also fined $100,000 (£73,000) last season for resting Markkanen in multiple games.\n\nThe Pacers' fine was issued for violating the player participation policy after a league investigation found Pascal Siakam and two other players who sat out the game \"could have played\" even if it was with \"reduced minutes\".\n\nThe policy was introduced in 2023 in an attempt to discourage teams from purposely losing to improve their chances in the draft lottery.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James becomes the oldest NBA player in history to get a triple-double originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLeBron James has always been one of the most impressive players in NBA history. In his younger years, he was always setting records for being the youngest player to do something.\n\nNow that he is 23 years into his NBA career, he is setting records for being the oldest player to do something. On Thursday, James had a triple-double for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Dallas Mavericks, marking another record for the 41-year-old.\n\nNow that he is 41 years old, LeBron continues to be one of the most impressive athletes out there. Most NBA players have retired by this point, but he is still going strong for the Lakers.\n\nHe is not only playing, but he is playing well on a good team. That is just a testament to how well James has taken care of his body over the years, and his natural talent being higher than almost everyone else.\n\nMORE: Lakers' LeBron James ends NBA record streak that is unlikely to be matched any time soon\n\nAgainst the Mavericks, James had a triple-double with his 28 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists. He almost did not get his 10th rebound because Austin Reaves was fighting him for boards.\n\nHead coach JJ Redick was pleased to see James get another achievement, as he is always proud to be his head coach at the tail-end of his career.\n\n\"I don't take for granted how good he is. I recognize that on a daily basis. The more remarkable thing is how much he cares in his 23rd year with all his accomplishments. He's got a 23-year prime basically,\" Redick said after the win against Dallas.\n\nNow, James is the oldest player to get a triple-double at 41. That is possibly one of the toughest records to ever beat because most players struggle to perform in their mid-30s.\n\nHowever, LeBron continues to stand out even if he is in his record-setting 23rd season. James seems ready to play more seasons, which is proof of his all-time greatness.\n\nHow Olympics allowed Lakers to load manage injuries for LeBron James, Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, Marcus Smart\n\nHow were Shaq, Duncan, Hakeem different as leaders?

The policy lays out rules for teams regarding participation of the league’s star players, which is defined as any player named to an All-NBA team or named an NBA All-Star in any of the previous three seasons.\n\nMarkkanen and Jackson are the only players on the Jazz for whom that definition applies to.\n\nOne rule in the policy states, “Teams must refrain from any long-term shutdown (or near shutdown) whereby a star player ceases participating in games or begins to play a materially reduced role in circumstances affecting the integrity of the game.”\n\nThe Jazz won’t have to worry about Jackson’s minutes moving forward this season, as the team announced Thursday that he will likely be out for the remainder of the season due to a knee surgery to remove a benign tumor.\n\nUtah head coach Will Hardy said he sat Markkanen against the Magic and Heat because Markkanen was on a minutes restriction, and Hardy said he’d continue to do so if instructed by the medical team.\n\n“So if our medical team puts a minutes restriction on Lauri, I’ll try to keep Lauri healthy,” Hardy said.\n\nThe Jazz were again without any of their star players in Thursday’s 135-119 loss to the Trail Blazers, as Keyonte George also continued to sit out due to an ankle sprain he sustained against the Magic.\n\nPortland was without All-Star Deni Avdija.\n\nThe Jazz played tight and went into halftime with a 63-61 lead but fell apart in the third quarter as it’s done numerous times this year.\n\nThe Trail Blazers outscored Utah 40-23 in the third.\n\n“The game got away from us in the third quarter, mostly because of fouling,” Hardy said. “They shot 16 free throws in the quarter. When that happens, it’s also hard to get into a rhythm offensively because you’re playing against a set defense for most of the time.”\n\nUtah did see some life in the fourth, especially from Svi Mykhailiuk. The veteran was out of the rotation for three straight games but came into Thursday’s contest and scored 14 points in just 17 minutes.\n\nHe shot 4 of 5 from behind the 3-point line and the Jazz opened the quarter outscoring Portland 22-10.\n\n“Svi’s been the ultimate pro his entire time with us,” Hardy said. “There are times that he’s in the rotation, there’s times he’s been a starter, there’s times he’s been out of the rotation and he always handles himself with a ton of class.”\n\nDespite the Jazz clawing back from a 15-point deficit, Portland ran away with it.\n\nBrice Sensabaugh led the Jazz with 28 points, while Kyle Filipowski, Isaiah Collier and Ace Bailey all added 15 points.\n\nUtah’s new two-way player, Blake Hinson, also saw his first minutes in Thursday’s loss and scored 11 points on 4 of 7 shooting in his debut.",

    "fullText": "It’s been a great season for the Boston Celtics, including Jaylen Brown.\n\nThe Celtics head into the NBA All-Star Break with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference at 35-19. They also rank second in the NBA in points per game allowed, second in offensive rating and third in net rating.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown is having a fantastic season in Jayson Tatum’s absence. He’s emerged as an MVP candidate amid the best year of his career and will start the NBA All-Star Game on Sunday.\n\nBoston is surging, too, winning six of its last seven games after blowing out the Chicago Bulls at home on Wednesday night. After ending the first half on a high note, Brown is proud of what the team has accomplished so far and is excited to see what it can do in the second half.\n\n“I’m proud of this group and staff/ office looking forward to 2nd half go Cs,” Brown posted on his X account on Thursday night, accompanied by a graphic comparing the Celtics’ performance at the All-Star Break this year compared to last year.\n\nI’m proud of this group and staff/ office looking forward to 2nd half go Cs ☘️ pic.twitter.com/I0cqxQTPYg\n\n— Jaylen Brown (@FCHWPO) February 13, 2026\n\nShockingly, the numbers are eerily similar despite Boston’s major roster turnover since then. The Celtics are a totally different team now after losing Kristaps Porzingis, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford and Luke Kornet over the offseason, not to mention Tatum to injury.\n\nAnd yet, Boston is still second in the East and third in net rating at the break, just like last year.\n\nThe Celtics’ remarkable consistency is due to several factors, including Brown’s stellar year, his teammates stepping up and Joe Mazzulla’s terrific coaching. Boston has persevered in the face of adversity this season, bringing the energy and intensity every night and usually finding a way to win.\n\nThe Celtics rebound well, shoot a lot of 3-pointers, play hard on defense and take care of the basketball. That’s been a recipe for success this season, and it may be even more effective after the All-Star Break if Tatum returns soon.\n\nWhen Is Celtics’ Next Game? Date, Time, How To Watch Boston’s Return After All-Star Break",

    "description": "An NBA insider issued a blunt outlook for the Lakers following recent comments from LeBron James, questioning the team’s championship trajectory this season.",
    "fullText": "NBA insider makes blunt Lakers prediction after LeBron James’ comments originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLeBron James set the NBA world off this week after making a blunt comment about comparisons between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n“You want me to compare us to them? That’s a championship team right there. We’re not. We can’t sustain energy and effort for 48 minutes, and they can. That’s why they won a championship,” James said after a convincing defeat against the champs.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Tim McMahon, James was described as “in a mood” and “grumpy” after the Tuesday night loss.\n\nCould he have a change of heart with a change of mood? Sure. But McMahon doesn’t seem to be buying it. The NBA insider claimed that James’ statement was a fact. The Lakers are good—but not championship good.\n\n“The Lakers got bounced in the first round last year and probably are getting bounced in the first round this year. They’re not close to a championship team. Sweet—10 games of improved defense—but they’re a bad defensive team.”\n\nYou could certainly consider a first-round exit for the Luka-LeBron Lakers a massive failure this season.\n\nIt would be a stunner to see the Lakers fall out of the playoff picture. They are going to enter the All-Star break as a top-six team in the Western Conference, but they aren’t too far out of the NBA Play-In Tournament.\n\nThe tournament doesn’t guarantee a miss, but it definitely doesn’t guarantee a ticket to the postseason either. The Lakers need to show a lot of improvement in the coming months.\n\nAccording to Basketball Reference’s playoff probability report, the Lakers have a 79 percent chance of cracking the playoffs this season. That’s the seventh-best in the West.\n\nIf the season ended at the break, the Lakers would draw a first-round series against the Denver Nuggets. In one meeting this year, the Lakers defeated the Nuggets, who were missing Nikola Jokic. Denver holds a 35-20 record and is widely viewed as a championship contender in the Western Conference.\n\nAt the end of the day, predictions and probabilities are just a guess. The Lakers haven’t exceeded expectations so far, but there is plenty of basketball left to be played.\n\nJose Alvarado posts stat line never done before in NBA history\n\nIs LeBron James playing vs. Mavericks tonight?\n\nJazz reportedly accused of tanking amid Jaren Jackson Jr. injury as NBA's Adam Silver put on notice\n\nRich Paul dives into why he thinks Heat president Pat Riley is not a fan of today's NBA\n\nIs Cooper Flagg playing tonight vs. Lakers?

    "description": "This year, the NBA All-Star Game will have a new USA vs. World format.",
    "fullText": "The timing could not have been more perfect.\n\nWhile on the other side of the globe some of the world's best athletes in their sports represent their countries at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, this year the best of the NBA will take on that international format:\n\nThe pride in representing your country could bring the most competitive All-Star Games we have seen in years. Remember, each of the last seven MVP awards have been won by players born outside the USA — and they are coming to compete.\n\n\"I'm never stepping onto the court to lose, you know, or not caring,\" said the Spurs Victor Wembanyama, who was voted a World starter by the fans. \"Just like at home, I'm never stepping into a board game, not caring or thinking I'm gonna lose, or I'm thinking it's okay to lose.\n\n\"So I'll be out there, might as well win.\"\n\nHere's all you need to know about the 2026 NBA All-Star Game and how not to miss a moment of the action/\n\nWhere: Intuit Dome, Inglewood, CA\n\nThis year, the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock — and it falls right in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format, a USA vs. World showdown that fans and players have been asking for.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players have been divided into three teams, two USA teams — USA Stripes and USA Stars — and one World Team. Those three teams will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games, each team playing at least two games.\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title. (If there is a tie, it comes down to point differential.)\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 5 p.m. Eastern, an earlier time than in previous years, leading into more coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nThere are two USA teams — Stars and Stripes — and one World team. Fans voted for five starters from each of the Western and Eastern Conferences, and the NBA coaches voted in the 14 reserve players (plus NBA Commissioner Adam Silver added one more USA player to balance the rosters, and also picked the injury replacements). The league divided up the teams.\n\n• Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee/Greece)\n• Luka Doncic (Los Angeles Lakers/Slovenia)\n• Nikola Jokic (Denver/Serbia)\n• Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio/France)\n• Karl-Anthony Towns (New York/Dominican Rep.)\n• Pascal Siakam (Indiana/Cameroon)\n• Deni Avdija (Portland/Israel)\n• Jamal Murray (Denver/Canada)\n• Alperen Sengun (Houston/Turkiye)\nCoach: Toronto's Darko Rajakovic (Serbia)\n\n• Cade Cunningham (Detroit)\n• Tyrese Maxey (Philadelphia)\n• Anthony Edwards (Minnesota)\n• Chet Holmgren (Oklahoma City)\n• Jalen Duren (Detroit)\n• Devin Booker (Phoenix)\n• Scottie Barnes (Toronto)\n• Jalen Johnson (Atlanta)\nCoach: Detroit's J.B. Bickerstaff\n\n• Jalen Brunson (New York)\n• Jaylen Brown (Boston)\n• LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers)\n• Kevin Durant (Houston)\n• Donovan Mitchell (Cleveland)\n• Kawhi Leonard (LA Clippers)\n• Norman Powell (Miami)\n• Brandon Ingram (Toronto)\nCoach: San Antonio's Mitch Johnson\n\n• Stephen Curry (Golden State)\n• Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City/Canada)\n• Both Luka Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo have missed games this week with injuries, but neither has been officially ruled out yet. The World team currently has nine players; if one drops out, there will be no need for Adam Silver to name a replacement.\n\nRising Stars G1: Team Melo vs. Team Austin - 9:00 PM ET\n\nRising Stars G2: Team Vince vs. Team T-Mac - 9:55 PM ET\n\nCastrol Rising Stars Championship - 10:35 PM ET\n\nNBA HBCU Classic Presented by AT&T - 11:00 PM ET\n\nState Farm 3-Point Contest - First Event - 5:00 PM ET\n\nEvery moment of All-Star Weekend — the Rising Stars challenge on Friday.

    "fullText": "The James Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is a step closer to adding to its esteemed roster of myriad basketball legends.\n\nOn Wednesday, three-time WNBA champion Candace Parker, Team USA’s 1996 women’s national team, Elena Delle Donne and Chamique Holdsclaw were among the premier names announced as finalists for the hoops hall, which will soon welcome many of the biggest names in the history of women’s basketball. Former NBA All-Stars Blake Griffin and Amar’e Stoudemire will also be finalists, with Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers also closer to the Hall.\n\nParker, a two-time WNBA MVP, will forever remain a pre-eminent part of influencing women’s hoops. In 2008, after an esteemed career at the University of Tennessee, she immediately broke through in the pros by becoming the first (and only) player in league history to win MVP and Rookie of the Year honors. Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld are the only NBA players to do so. Parker, whose 16-year career ended in 2023, is ranked 10th in WNBA history in total points, third in rebounds, 11th in assists, fifth in blocks and 18th in career steals. She was named WNBA Finals MVP in 2016 after leading the Los Angeles Sparks to their fourth title in team history. In 2021, she led her hometown Chicago Sky to the franchise’s only WNBA championship.\n\nNicknamed the Women’s Dream Team, the 1996 Team USA women’s national squad remains one of the most dominant in the game’s history. It was led by several prominent names who are already individually enshrined in the Naismith Hall of Fame: Dawn Staley, Lisa Leslie, Rebecca Lobo, Sheryl Swoopes, Teresa Edwards and Katrina McClain. The roster also included Jennifer Azzi, Ruthie Bolton, Venus Lacy, Nikki McCray, Carla McGhee and Katy Steding. Credited with aiding the launch of the WNBA, this team defeated opponents by an average of 28.6 points per game en route to gold medal honors.\n\nDelle Donne, whose 10-year career ended in 2023, is the only player in WNBA history to win MVP honors with multiple franchises (2019 with Washington Mystics, 2015 with Chicago Sky). She steps closer to the hall thanks to her unique combination of shooting touch and basketball IQ, becoming the first player in WNBA history to join the prestigious 50-40-90 club (shooting at least 50 percent overall, 40 percent on 3-pointers and 90 percent on free throws for a full season). Her career scoring average of 19.5 points per game ranks fifth highest in WNBA history.\n\nHoldsclaw won WNBA Rookie of the Year honors in 1999 after averaging 16.9 points and 7.9 rebounds in her first season as a pro. She finished in the top 10 of MVP voting six times over her 11 WNBA seasons, during which she averaged 16.9 points and 7.6 rebounds. She peaked in 2003, averaging 20.5 points and 10.9 rebounds for the Washington Mystics. She finished her career with three All-WNBA selections and six All-Star nods and notched the 2002 league scoring title while leading the league in rebounds twice. But those accomplishments weren’t a surprise given her elite collegiate career at Tennessee, where she won Naismith Player of the Year honors twice (1998-99) and led the Lady Volunteers to three titles.\n\nFor the men’s side of this year’s finalist bracket, Rivers is one of seven coaches in NBA history to win Coach of the Year honors in their first season with a team, doing so with the Orlando Magic in 1999-00. His 1,183 regular-season wins rank sixth in NBA history. In 2008, he led the greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history as the Boston Celtics snapped a championship drought of over 20 years. In 2022, the NBA named Rivers as one of the 15 greatest coaches in league history.\n\nGriffin, who retired after the 2022-23 season, spent years as one of the most talented and athletic players in the NBA. He averaged 21.4 points and 9.0 rebounds over 765 career games, including a special run as the face of Lob City during arguably the most successful era in the LA Clippers’ history. For the 2013-14 season, he finished third in MVP voting after averaging 24.3 points (second-highest scoring average of his career), 9.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists. His seven triple-doubles are tied for second most in Clippers history.\n\nLike Griffin’s, Stoudemire’s athletic prowess and unmatched skill on offense made for a unique mix over a special career. He was pivotal to the Phoenix Suns’ revival led by two-time MVP Steve Nash and then-coach Mike D’Antoni, who joins Stoudemire as a finalist for the Hall. Stoudemire notched six All-Star selections and five All-NBA nods over his 14-year career in the NBA. At his peak, the 2002-03 Rookie of the Year averaged over 25 points per game and was one of the league’s most potent dunkers. He finished his career with averages of 18.9 points and 7.8 rebounds in 846 career games.\n\nD’Antoni’s 253 regular-season wins with Phoenix rank third in franchise history. His run as coach of the Seven Seconds or Less Suns included two runs to the Western Conference finals. During D’Antoni’s four full seasons as coach (2004-05 to 2007-08), Phoenix ranked third in the NBA in win percentage (.707) and total victories (232).\n\nThere are 21 total finalists this year. Others include Marques Johnson, Mark Few, Jerry Welsh, Dick Motta, Gary McKnight, Kelvin Sampson, Molly Bolin-Kazmer, Tal Brody, Joey Crawford and Kevin Johnson. The inductees will be announced in April. Enshrinement weekend is scheduled for later this year at Mohegan Sun Arena, beginning with a tip-off celebration and awards gala Aug. 14. The commencement ceremony will take place the next day at the Symphony Hall in Springfield, Mass.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "As the NBA heads into the 2026 All-Star Weekend, the league’s best playmakers have already put on a masterclass in ball movement and creativity. The assists per game leaders aren’t just piling up numbers — they’re shaping the identity of their teams with vision, timing, and unselfishness. From superstar point guards to versatile big men, this season’s leaders prove that elite passing is still one of basketball’s most beautiful arts.\n\n– 10.7 assists per game\nJokić continues to redefine what playmaking looks like from the center position. His vision is almost point-guard level, threading backdoor passes and cross-court lasers with effortless precision. Denver’s offense flows through him because he reads defenses two steps ahead. What makes his assists special isn’t just the number — it’s how calmly and creatively he creates easy shots for everyone else.\n\n– 9.6 assists per game\nCunningham has fully embraced the role of Detroit’s offensive orchestrator. He controls tempo, keeps defenders on his hip, and consistently finds shooters in rhythm. His size allows him to see over defenses, making sharp reads out of pick-and-roll situations. Cade’s passing has become the heartbeat of the Pistons’ offense.\n\n– 8.6 assists per game\nDončić remains one of the most dangerous dual threats in the league. His scoring gravity forces double teams, and he punishes them with pinpoint passes to cutters and shooters. Luka’s ability to manipulate defenders with hesitation dribbles opens up lanes others simply don’t see. Every possession feels like a chess match — and he’s usually winning it.\n\n– 8.2 assists per game\nJohnson’s playmaking leap has been one of the most impressive developments this season. As a forward, he pushes the pace and makes quick decisions in transition. Atlanta benefits from his versatility, as he can facilitate from the wing or the top of the key. His assists often come from aggressive drives that collapse the defense.\n\n– 8.1 assists per game\nEven years into his career, Harden remains an elite offensive conductor. His mastery of pick-and-roll reads and pocket passes keeps defenses constantly guessing. He patiently surveys the floor before delivering perfectly timed kick-outs to shooters. Harden’s passing IQ continues to age like fine wine.\n\n– 7.6 assists per game\nMurray’s chemistry with Jokić fuels one of the league’s most fluid offenses. He balances scoring and facilitating beautifully, knowing when to attack and when to distribute. His ability to draw help defenders opens clean looks on the perimeter. Murray’s assists often come in high-pressure moments, showcasing his composure.\n\n– 7.5 assists per game\nNembhard has quietly developed into a reliable floor general for Indiana. He makes smart, efficient reads and rarely forces unnecessary passes. His steady presence keeps the Pacers organized, especially in half-court sets. The growth in his assist numbers reflects his increasing confidence and command.\n\n– 7.4 assists per game\nLaMelo’s flair is unmatched when it comes to creative passing. Whether it’s a no-look dime or a full-court hit-ahead pass, he thrives on turning routine plays into highlights. His instinctive feel for spacing allows him to find teammates in stride. Charlotte’s offense sparks whenever he’s orchestrating.\n\n– 7.2 assists per game\nCollier’s emergence as a facilitator has been a bright spot for Utah. He shows maturity beyond his years with his patience in the lane and sharp kick-outs to shooters. His ability to break down defenders off the dribble creates consistent scoring chances for teammates. The assist numbers highlight his growing comfort at the NBA level.\n\n– 7.1 assists per game\nMitchell’s playmaking complements his well-known defensive intensity. He attacks gaps aggressively, forcing rotations that lead to open looks. His improved court awareness has elevated Miami’s ball movement this season. Mitchell’s assists often come from hustle plays that turn defense into offense.\n\nWith the spotlight of All-Star Weekend shining bright, these assist leaders have earned their place among the league’s most impactful players. Their ability to elevate teammates and control the flow of the game makes them invaluable every single night. As the second half of the season unfolds, expect their playmaking brilliance to continue defining the race toward the playoffs.\n\nSUPER BOWL: Way-too-early 2027 Super Bowl odds following NFL season\n\nNFL DRAFT: Updated 2026 NFL Draft order following Seahawks’ Super Bowl 60 win\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 for Week 15\n\nMLB: League advised teams to ‘tell players to carry their papers’ to avoid ICE detention\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Shocking details emerge from James Pearce Jr, Rickea Jackson domestic dispute\n\nThe post NBA assists per game season leaders before the 2026 All-Star weekend appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Westchester then kicked it into gear, extending their lead to as many as 11 points in the first half while holding the Valley to just 19 points in the second quarter.\n\nDespite the deficit and being held under 20 points in the second, the Suns kept it competitive, trailing 56-47 at halftime.\n\nSep 24, 2025; Phoenix, AZ, USA; Phoenix Suns and Valley Suns guard Damion Baugh (30) poses for a portrait during Media Day at PHX Arena.

It didn’t take long for the Knicks to get their pace back, regaining their footing and taking an 81-70 lead.\n\nThe Knicks opened up another double-digit lead, but were limited from beyond the arc. It came down to the final seconds of the game, with the Valley in possession of the ball before Damion Baugh sank in a go-ahead shot from three to give the Suns the lead.\n\nFeb 6, 2026; Detroit, Michigan, USA; New York Knicks forward Pacome Dadiet (4) walks off the court after the game against the Detroit Pistons at Little Caesars Arena. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-Imagn Images\n\nWhile Westchester had the final possession, Pacome Dadiet couldn’t connect with a three-pointer of his own as the Suns rebounded to drain the clock.\n\n“It was obviously a good win,” head coach Paul Jesperson said postgame. “Kind of a unique period for us because we had that little break in between our last game… So we were able to get two really good practices in, which you don’t always get to go five-on-five, some of that stuff at this time of the year.”\n\nBaugh led the scoring for the Valley with 29 points, eight assists and five rebounds. Jaden Shackelford and RJ Nembhard Jr. had 22 points each in the victory.\n\nThe Valley Suns now look towards their next challenge, taking on the Salt Lake City Stars on Thursday, Feb. 12, at 12 p.m.\n\nZac Gallen and Diamondbacks reunion?

    "fullText": "Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs ran roughshod over the injury-depleted Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, the French superstar matching his NBA season high with 40 points in a 136-108 rout.\n\nWembanyama, whose California swing will include a second All-Star Game appearance on Sunday, added 12 rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot, connecting on 13 of 20 attempts from the field in his 26 minutes of work.\n\nThe Lakers were without a raft of starters, with LeBron James and Luka Doncic sidelined along with Austin Reaves and Marcus Smart.\n\nDoncic missed a third straight game with a hamstring strain. James sat out the second night of a back-to-back to manage foot arthritis.\n\nWembanyama took full advantage, setting the tone with 25 points in just eight minutes on the floor in the first quarter.\n\nHe had 37 by halftime -- the most by any player in a first half this season -- when the Spurs led 84-55.\n\nHe cooled off in the third quarter, but matched the 40 points he put up on opening night before sitting out the fourth period with the rest of the Spurs starters.\n\nThe only down note for the Spurs was an injury to 2025 Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle, who took a hard fall under the basket in the second quarter and exited with a pelvic contusion.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers, fueled by 30 points from Pascal Siakam, stunned the New York Knicks 137-134 in an overtime thriller at Madison Square Garden.\n\nEight Pacers players scored in double figures to bring home the win in a game that featured a season-high 39 lead changes.\n\nAndrew Nembhard added 24 points and 10 rebounds and Quenton Jackson scored 19, including two game-sealing free-throws with 3.9 seconds left in overtime.\n\nJalen Brunson scored 40 points with five rebounds and eight assists for the Knicks. Josh Hart chipped in a triple-double of 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.\n\nMikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns added 22 points apiece -- Towns drilling two free-throws to force overtime before fouling out in the extra session.\n\nThe Pacers scored the first nine points in overtime before the Knicks staged a furious rally, cutting the deficit to one on a three-pointer from Brunson before Jackson closed it out at the line.\n\nThe Pacers have been a shadow of the team that beat the Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals last season with Tyrese Haliburton sidelined by the ruptured Achilles tendon he suffered in their NBA Finals loss to Oklahoma City.\n\nBut they snapped a four-game skid with just their fourth road win of the season, this one against a Knicks team that came in tied for the second most home wins in the league with 21.\n\n\"This was a really important game for us,\" said Pacers coach Rick Carlisle. \"The season that we've had, this environment, the opponent -- our guys had a great collective spirit and collective will tonight.\"\n\nIn Houston, Kevin Durant scored 26 points to lead the Rockets to a 102-95 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nDown by one at halftime, the Rockets took control in the third quarter. They led by six going into the fourth and quickly pushed the lead to 15 to cruise home.",

He also played in the Chicago All-Star Game in 2020, when he was with the Pelicans, the year he won Most Improved Player.\n\nThis year, Ingram finished 10th in the Eastern Conference fan voting and eighth in the player voting. The only players who got more fan votes but are not in the game are Brooklyn's Michael Porter Jr. (day-to-day with a knee issue) and James Harden, who was recently traded from the Clippers — who are hosting this All-Star Game — to the Cavaliers.\n\nIngram earned this spot as the leading scorer on the No. 5-seeded Raptors, averaging 22 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game, with 33 games in which he scored 20 or more points.\n\nThis year, the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock — and it falls right in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.

However, he’s thrown down several highlight-worthy dunks in his career, including an Eastbay on Jan. 26.\n\nThis isn't Jaxson Hayes' first Eastbay...\n\nHe went between the legs for the slam on April 2, 2024 🤯 https://t.co/9IhnKU2Hr0 pic.twitter.com/x6DBABBBdr\n\nThe 3-Point Contest, meanwhile, is headlined by a player who could provide one of the best All-Star Weekend storylines in recent memory.\n\nLillard hasn’t appeared in an NBA game since he tore his Achilles in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals April 27. Despite that, he finds himself as the favorite or co-favorite at the two top sportsbooks and the only player with minus-money odds (-120) at FanDuel to qualify for the final round.\n\nThe longtime Portland Trail Blazers stalwart won the event in 2023 and 2024.\n\nDamian Lillard wins the NBA Three-Point Contest 🔥pic.twitter.com/0MCKjFOs7y\n\n— Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) February 19, 2023\n\nNotably, Charlotte Hornets rookie Kon Knueppel is second. A win would make him the first player in franchise history to hoist the trophy.\n\nThe Skills Challenge is being replaced by the Shooting Stars competition, which has not been seen at All-Star Weekend since 2015.\n\nThe competition will see three-person teams compete to score points by nailing jumpers from designated areas on the court. The last team to win was Team Bosh, which consisted of Chris Bosh, Dominique Wilkins, and Swin Cash.\n\nTeams competing in this year’s event include:\n\nTeam Knicks: Jalen Brunson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Allan Houston\nTeam Cameron: Kon Kneuppel, Jalen Johnson, Corey Maggette\nTeam All-Stars: Scottie Barnes, Chet Holmgren, Richard Hamilton\nTeam Harper: Dylan Harper, Ron Harper, Ron Harper Jr.\n\nThe new All-Star Game round-robin tournament will see three teams compete in four 12-minute games. The top two teams based on the aggregate score of their matchups will advance to the championship round, where they will play a final 12-minute contest.\n\nWhile FanDuel and DraftKings are split on which team will win the mini-tournament, they agree that USA Stars are the long shot.\n\nThe teams and individuals who will take the floor include:\n\nUSA Stars: Scottie Barnes, Devin Booker, Cade Cunningham, Jalen Duren, Anthony Edwards, Chet Holmgren, Jalen Johnson, Tyrese Maxey\nUSA Stripes: Jaylen Brown, Jalen Brunson, Brandon Ingram, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Donovan Mitchell, Norman Powell\nWorld: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Deni Avdija, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Alperen Sengun, Pascal Siakam, Karl-Anthony Towns, Victor Wembanyama\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Isaiah Stewart sprinting across the court to confront Miles Bridges during a heated Pistons-Hornets clash has sent NBA fans into meltdown.\n\nThe chaotic moment quickly overshadowed the game itself, with video clips spreading faster than officials could regain control.\n\nFootage shared by Legion Hoops captured the exact moment Isaiah Stewart broke into a full sprint toward Miles Bridges as tensions boiled over.\n\nThe incident unfolded during a dead ball after Bridges became involved in an altercation with Pistons big man Jalen Duren. As players converged, Stewart rushed in from a distance, escalating the confrontation within seconds.\n\nAccording to the official NBA report, Stewart, Bridges, Duren, and Charlotte’s Moussa Diabate were all ejected for fighting activity. The situation deteriorated so rapidly that officials had little choice but to clear multiple players from the floor.\n\nThe chaos did not stop there. Hornets head coach Charles Lee was also ejected later in the fourth quarter after aggressively approaching an official and needing to be restrained by his own player.\n\nFor Stewart, the moment reinforced a growing reputation. His willingness to jump into confrontations has become a defining part of his on-court identity, particularly in emotionally charged games.\n\nFan reaction online was immediate and polarising. Some drew dramatic historical comparisons, with one writing, “Malice the Palace 2.0,” referencing the league’s most infamous brawl.\n\nOthers focused on the league’s image. “This is not a good sight for the game,” one fan commented, echoing concerns about optics and discipline.\n\nNot everyone disapproved. Some embraced the chaos, with one post reading, “Isaiah Stewart will always be doing ts, and I love it.” That sentiment reflected a segment of fans who admire Stewart’s raw intensity.\n\nThere was also speculation about consequences. “Mr. Silver may make an example out of him,” one fan wrote, anticipating potential league discipline given Stewart’s history.\n\nAnother summed up the pattern bluntly. “I’ve never seen Isaiah Stewart’s video on the TL without a fight.” The comment captured how frequently Stewart finds himself at the center of viral confrontations.\n\nWith punches reportedly thrown and multiple ejections issued, the incident is now firmly on the NBA’s radar. Suspensions and fines remain possible as the league reviews the footage.\n\nWhy Seattle sports fans could have even more to celebrate after the Seahawks’ Super Bowl win\n\nKnicks star suggests five artists for next Super Bowl halftime show as Jalen Brunson reacts to Bad Bunny\n\nBad Bunny took a daring shot at LeBron James, the LA Lakers star must be outraged",

    "fullText": "The trade deadline was Thursday, February 5th, and many players made the move to new destinations. Certain teams tried to solidify their rosters for the playoffs, while others did complete teardowns in return for future draft assets. With the trade deadline in the rearview window, the league has three days of games before the 2026 All-Star break from February 13 to February 19.\n\nUpon returning to game action, the playoff hunt will be in full force. Here are the NBA team power rankings heading into Week 17.\n\nSacramento needs to get younger. The Kings’ starting rotation does not include any young superstars, and the bench lacks high-upside depth. The team fails to post high outputs on offense and lacks the ability to prevent opponents from scoring.\n\nMORE: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nNew Orleans is near the bottom in points per game and almost dead last in points allowed per game. The front office’s moves haven’t worked since Zion Williamson was drafted in 2019. The organization must find a way to offload Williamson, Dejounte Murray, and any other veteran players to acquire future draft picks.\n\nThe Pacers have had the brutal season that was expected. The team lost their court general, Tyrese Haliburton, during last year’s NBA Finals, and it’s clear the team has no plans to rush him back this season. During Thursday’s trade deadline, the front office acquired veteran center Ivica Zubac for unrestricted free agent Bennedict Mathurin and two first-round picks. This move sets Indiana up for next season and beyond.\n\nWashington is one of the league’s worst in offense and defense. The team made another big splash last Thursday, acquiring Anthony Davis from Dallas. Once healthy, the Wizards’ starting lineup will feature Trae Young and Anthony Davis.\n\nThe Nets are dead last in points per game, and one of their best scorers, Cam Thomas, has missed more than half of the team’s games due to injury. Now is the time to add draft capital as the team has two first-round picks in 2027, 2028, and 2029. Brooklyn must hit on upcoming draft picks.\n\nAs of last Monday, Utah looked poised to trade forward Lauri Markkanen. The Jazz went another direction, acquiring Jaren Jackson Jr. on Tuesday. Jackson Jr. immediately bolsters the roster heading into next season.\n\nLast season’s deal that sent Luka Doncic to Los Angeles looks worse after last week. On Wednesday, Dallas sent Anthony Davis to Washington for a return of players, including Khris Middleton, two first-round picks, and three second-round picks. Between the trades of Doncic and Davis, the Mavericks did not receive a young player with high upside.\n\nMemphis traded Jaren Jackson Jr. last Tuesday, and shipping Ja Morant in an offseason trade will set the franchise in full rebuild mode. The Grizzlies have taken a 180 following last season’s dismissal of head coach Taylor Jenkins. Jenkins led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe weeks leading up to last Thursday’s trade deadline were headlined by Milwaukee potentially trading Giannis Antetokounmpo. The team fielded calls but decided no offers were good enough. The front office needs offseason upgrades, but the team’s superstar may force his way out this summer.\n\nChicago underwent a full teardown by the trade deadline. However, the team did not receive a single first-round pick in any trade. The Bulls will use their salary cap in the upcoming offseasons while packaging a plethora of second-round picks in future trades.\n\nCharlotte’s front office saw that the team was near the playoffs and added at the trade deadline. The team acquired Coby White from Chicago and Tyus Jones from Orlando. White and Jones add depth to the Hornets’ offense that ranks 11th in points per game.\n\nLos Angeles is in playoff contention and decided to move 36-year-old James Harden to Cleveland for point guard Darius Garland. Thursday’s deadline saw the team move veteran Ivica Zubac to Indiana for Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, and two first-round picks. The moves signaled the Clippers were unwilling to give Harden another big payday, and now is the time to rebuild the roster around younger players.\n\nThe Trail Blazers have struggled over the past two weeks but are contending for the play-in tournament. The front office didn’t make a move at the trade deadline, holding onto future draft picks. If Portland can improve defensively, they can reach the playoffs following the play-in tournament.\n\nAtlanta acquired offensive pieces after trading Kristaps Porzingis to Golden State for Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield. The additions of Kuminga and Hield upgrade the team’s depth. The Hawks are in contention to make it out of the Eastern Conference play-in tournament.\n\nOrlando’s main objective as the season continues is to have its roster healthy for the play-in tournament. The talent is there, and the Magic will be a tough matchup in the postseason. The team can make a push for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nOffensively, Miami ranks in the top five in points per game and will compete with any opposing team. The Heat’s issues start on defense. The team ranks near the bottom of the league in points allowed per game.\n\nGolden State moved disgruntled forward Jonathan Kuminga and guard Buddy Hield for center Kristaps Porzingis. They were unable to achieve the rumored deal to land Giannis Antetokounmpo from Milwaukee. The Warriors will continue feeling the loss of Jimmy Butler and will be lucky to get past the first round of the playoffs should they survive the play-in tournament.\n\nThe Raptors continue to march in the right direction. Their offense isn’t among the league’s best, but they haven’t dealt with serious injuries, and the defense ranks in the top 10. Improvements to the offense will lead Toronto to success as the season finishes out.\n\nThe 76ers didn’t make any splashes at the trade deadline but moved Jared McCain to the Thunder for a 2026 first-round pick and three second-round picks. Philadelphia is currently sitting in a playoff spot and needs a strong finish to the season. The team’s lack of depth may be their downfall in the playoffs.\n\nPhoenix has had a strong season and is hovering between a spot in the playoffs and the play-in tournament. The Suns’ defense has been a strong suit this season. Entering the playoffs healthy makes Phoenix a tough matchup for any opposing team.\n\nLos Angeles continues to battle Phoenix for a solidified spot in the playoffs or a trip to the play-in tournament. Defensive lapses have caused the Lakers issues this season, but the team continues to rebound. This may be LeBron James’s last shot at another title.\n\nThe Timberwolves added a depth piece when they acquired Ayo Dosunmu from the Bulls. Dosunmu gives the team versatility as a ball handler or shooting guard. Minnesota is ready to spring into the postseason.\n\nSince the end of December, Cleveland has gone on a run. The Cavaliers have moved up the Eastern Conference standings and are resembling the strong team they had last season. Ahead of last week’s trade deadline, the team acquired James Harden in exchange for Darius Garland. Harden gives the team a reliable option on offense.\n\nThe Rockets continue their consistent play and are one of the league’s best defensive teams. The team didn’t make any trade deadline deals and feels content with the current state of the roster. Houston can be a contender for the Western Conference Finals if Kevin Durant is healthy.\n\nDenver is one of the three best teams in the Western Conference. Nikola Jokic missed time a month ago, but Jamal Murray picked up the slack as he’s having the best season of his career and earned his first All-Star selection. A healthy Denver team, led by Nikola Jokic, can beat anyone in the playoffs.\n\nBoston continues to be one of the Eastern Conference’s top teams after many expected the team to struggle following Jayson Tatum’s injury in last season’s playoffs. Needing an upgrade at center, the Celtics acquired Nikola Vucevic from the Bulls. Boston has the talent to reach the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOne of the league’s best on offense and defense, New York is ready to chase Detroit for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks were close to reaching the NBA Finals last season and have unfinished business. If New York and Detroit face off in the conference finals, the Knicks’ experience may give them the edge in the series.\n\nSan Antonio has been near the top of the Western Conference throughout the season. Victor Wembanyama has stayed healthy and is leading the team. Wembanyama’s previous seasons have ended following the All-Star Break. If the Spurs want to be serious title contenders, they must do everything in their power to keep Victor Wembanyama on the court.\n\nDetroit has sat atop the Eastern Conference for most of the season. The team has produced a top 10 offense and a top 3 defense. The front office added a much-needed three-point shooter, acquiring Kevin Huerter from the Bulls.\n\nOklahoma City has been the favorite to win the championship throughout the season. They lead the league in points scored and points allowed per game. The front office added a high-upside depth piece when they acquired Jared McCain from Philadelphia at the trade deadline.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break appeared first on The Big Lead.",

At the end of the day, we would love to keep it basketball, but things happen. Everybody was just playing hard,\" Duren said after the match.\n\n\"This isn't the first time that people have tried to be like extra aggressive with us and talk to us, whatever the case may be.\n\n\"At the end of the day, emotions got high with everybody being competitive. Things happen.\"\n\nBridges later apologised to fans, writing on Instagram: \"Sorry Hornets nation! Sorry Hornets Organization! Always going to protect my team-mates forever.\"\n\nLead official John Goble said in a post-game report the players were ejected because they \"engaged in fighting activity during the dead ball\".\n\n\"After review, we assessed fighting fouls, and by rule, they were ejected from the game,\" he added.\n\nLee, asked about the clash between Diabate and Duren that triggered the wider brawl, said: \"Two guys got in a heated conversation and then it kind of spiralled from there.\"\n\nOf his own ejection in the fourth quarter, Lee added: \"I've got to have a little bit better emotional control in that moment.\"\n\nElsewhere, Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry will miss Sunday's All-Star game with an injury to his right knee.\n\nHowever, the Warriors are hopeful Curry will return after the All-Star break for the game against the Boston Celtics on 19 February.",

    "fullText": "The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons put on a show Monday night, and it had little to do with basketball. In the third quarter, players from both sides got into an all-out brawl that baffled spectators, and other NBA players who later saw the footage had strong reactions as well.\n\nThe altercation began when Moussa Diabate fouled Jalen Duren. Duren responded by pushing Diabaté in the face, which quickly escalated the situation. Moments later, Isaiah Stewart came running from the Pistons bench and got into it with Miles Bridges, who had also stepped into the fray. The chaos ultimately led to all four players being ejected.\n\nJaylen Brown was at home, streaming. And with the Hornets vs. Pistons brawl being the talk of the town, he decided to react to it.\n\nThe Celtics star understood why Diabate lost his cool. In the heat of the moment, he said that when someone “mushes” or shoves another player’s face, it can make your blood boil. Brown even hinted that he might have reacted the same way if he were in Diabate’s position.\n\n“If a dude takes his hand and mush your face like that… I ain’t gon lie, somebody gotta die,” Brown declared, treating the mushing of one’s face as the ultimate disrespect.\n\nThe NBA, however, will not agree with Diabate or any of the other three involved. The players will likely be suspended, with Stewart, who ran the length of the court to join a fight he was not initially involved in, expected to face the harshest penalty.\n\nStewart, meanwhile, was unapologetic. “You don’t expect me to sit on the bench. The f *k I got drafted to Detroit for,”* he was heard saying in the tunnel after getting ejected. Duren, on the other hand, seemed to realize that the situation got out of hand.\n\n“At the end of the day, we would love to keep it basketball, but things happen. Everybody was just playing hard,” he said, but admittedthat the Pistons have been targeted by rivals throughout the entire season. “This isn’t the first time that people have tried to be like extra aggressive with us and talk to us, whatever the case may be.”\n\nThe post “Somebody Gotta Die”: Jaylen Brown Assesses Jalen Duren ‘Mushing’ Moussa Diabate’s Face During Hornets-Pistons Brawl appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Throughout NBA history, the Los Angeles Lakers have been home to some of the most dominant scorers the game has ever seen. From the league’s earliest days to the modern era, Lakers stars have not only carried their team offensively but also set the scoring standard for the entire NBA. Leading the league in scoring while wearing purple and gold has always signaled a season of individual brilliance and historical significance.\n\n2025–26: 33.5 PPG (current pace)\n\nIn his first season wearing a Lakers uniform, Doncic immediately established himself as the league’s most dominant offensive force. His scoring lead reflects a rare blend of volume, efficiency, and creativity, as he punishes defenses at all three levels. Luka’s ability to control tempo while still producing elite numbers makes this season feel both historic and sustainable. If the pace holds, it would be one of the most impressive scoring campaigns in franchise history.\n\nKobe’s back-to-back scoring titles represent the apex of his individual offensive dominance. The 2004–05 season showcased his unmatched shot-making and willingness to shoulder the entire offensive burden. In 2005–06, he followed it up with another scoring crown, highlighted by legendary performances and relentless competitiveness. These seasons cemented Bryant as the most feared scorer of his era.\n\nShaq’s scoring title came during the lockout-shortened season, where his physical dominance was simply overwhelming. Defenses had no answer for his combination of size, power, and touch around the rim. Night after night, opponents were forced to foul or concede easy points. This season set the stage for the Lakers’ upcoming dynasty.\n\nJerry West led the league in scoring during a period defined by tough defense and limited spacing, making his numbers even more remarkable. His offensive game was built on precision, footwork, and an unshakable confidence in big moments. West carried the Lakers with consistency and poise, embodying the prototype of a complete guard. This season further solidified his legacy as one of the greatest scorers of his generation.\n\nGeorge Mikan was the NBA’s first true dominant scorer and the foundation of the Lakers’ early success. His three consecutive scoring titles came at a time when the league was still defining itself, and Mikan was clearly ahead of his peers. He forced rule changes, reshaped defensive strategies, and established the center position as the game’s focal point. These seasons made him the original face of Lakers greatness.\n\nEach Lakers player who led the NBA in scoring reflects a different era, style, and evolution of the game, yet all share the same impact: offensive supremacy. Whether through finesse, power, or relentless shot-making, these seasons stand as benchmarks of greatness within the franchise’s storied legacy. Together, they reinforce why the Lakers remain synonymous with elite scorers and unforgettable individual performances.\n\nThe post Los Angeles Lakers players who led NBA in scoring appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NBA Three-Point Contest brings together a compelling mix of proven champions, first-time participants, and rising shooters who reflect how central the long ball has become in today’s game. From seasoned All-Stars with past hardware to young players eager to announce themselves on a national stage, this field is stacked with both credibility and intrigue. Each competitor enters with a distinct shooting profile, ensuring a contest defined by contrasting styles, streaks, and momentum swings.\n\nDevin Booker returns to the Three-Point Contest as one of the more experienced shooters in the field, bringing back memorable performances from past All-Star Weekends. Although his current 3-point percentage this season is a career low, his pedigree and confidence with the deep ball keep him a threat on the racks. Booker won this event in 2018 and has made multiple appearances, which gives him both historical relevance and fan appeal. Expect him to lean on his rhythm and composure when the clock starts.\n\nRookie Kon Knueppel has quickly established himself as one of the league’s rising long-range threats with an excellent percentage this season. His inclusion in the contest marks a rare opportunity for a first-year player to compete for the title, and he’ll aim to become the first rookie ever to win. Knueppel’s high volume and efficient shooting make him a serious contender right out of the gate. His youth and fearless shooting style will be fun to watch as he battles veterans.\n\nDespite missing the entire NBA season with a torn Achilles, Damian Lillard will still suit up for the 3-Point Contest, a testament to his elite reputation as a marksman. Lillard is a two-time winner of this event and can tie the all-time record with his third title. His career 3-point scoring and clutch gene make him a perennial fan favorite, regardless of in-season play. Lillard’s participation adds a compelling storyline of resilience and competitive pride.\n\nTyrese Maxey enters the contest riding a breakout season as one of the NBA’s most dynamic scorers, combining pace with deep shooting prowess. This will be his first appearance in the Three-Point Contest, aligning with his first All-Star starter nod. Maxey’s ability to make tough catch-and-shoot attempts under pressure gives him a versatile edge on the racks. His confidence from downtown blends well with his overall offensive game, making him a dark-horse candidate.\n\nDonovan Mitchell is another All-Star entering the contest with a reputation for confident and flashy deep shooting. As the Cavaliers’ lead scorer, Mitchell blends volume with creativity, often pulling up from range in rhythm. His presence adds star power and competitive intensity to the field, especially when the spotlight gets bright. Expect Mitchell to attack the money balls with the same aggression he brings in late-game situations.\n\nJamal Murray brings his sharpshooting pedigree from both the regular season and playoff stages to the Three-Point Contest. Known for his calm demeanor and clutch threes, Murray complements Stephen Curry’s shooting leadership in Denver’s offense. This appearance aligns with his first All-Star selection, showcasing his ascent among the league’s premier perimeter scorers. Given his range and confidence, he can heat up quickly when the rack lights turn on.\n\nVeteran forward Bobby Portis Jr. earned his first 3-Point Contest nod thanks to a breakout shooting season, boasting one of the highest percentages among contestants. His stride into elite floor spacing has helped Milwaukee’s offense evolve, making him more than a traditional big man. Portis’ smooth release and catch-and-shoot rhythm make him a legitimate threat in this format. His inclusion underscores how modern bigs can impact spacing and contest formats alike.\n\nNorman Powell enters the event as an All-Star and one of Miami’s most reliable 3-point shooters this season. His shooting profile blends athleticism with catch-and-shoot efficiency, and he has experience from prior contests as well. Powell’s ability to get hot in spurts could make him dangerous in the rapid-fire rhythm of the 3-Point Contest. As a player who thrives in momentum, he’ll look to heat up early and carry it through the rounds.\n\nWhen the final rack is emptied on Saturday, February 14 at 5:00 p.m. ET, the 2026 Three‑Point Contest is sure to hinge on rhythm, confidence, and a competitor’s ability to perform under the clock. With this blend of elite scorers, specialists, and fearless newcomers all taking aim at the same moment, the difference between victory and elimination could be a single swish or miss. No matter who hoists the title at the State Farm 3‑Point Contest, this field underscores how deep shooting continues to define the modern NBA and why this event remains one of All‑Star Weekend’s most anticipated traditions.\n\nThe post NBA 2026 Three-point contest participants appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Guarding Michael Jordan never felt more like a death sentence than it did for Kevin Johnson during the 1993 NBA Finals. Johnson has long stated how he feels terrible about how Charles Barkley is ringless due to that Finals. However, with MJ on the other end of the court, perhaps that was inevitable?\n\nThe ’93 Finals had several intersecting and interesting storylines. One was the fact that Jordannever saw Dan Majerle as a threat. Dan was propped up to be a ‘Jordan stopper’ of sorts but this didn’t move the needle for him in the slightest.\n\nGames 1 and 2 saw Jordan score a total of 73 points and the Bulls go up 2-0 with Majerle guarding ‘His Airness’. The Suns coaching staff saw this as a clear misstep and defensive deficiency. Their next course of action? Have Kevin Johnson take up the task.\n\n“I walk straight in that church and I sit in the front row. I’m like, ‘Jesus, I don’t believe in you no more,’” saidJohnson the Club520 podcast. The concept of having to defend Michael in the Finals was so unfathomable for KJ that he, at first, believed he had dreamt it.\n\nWhen he told MJ during Game 3’s jumpball that he was guarding him, the latter’s reaction was a mere “Huh?”\n\nFunnily enough, the Suns ended up winning Game 3 in triple overtime despite Jordan’s 44. Johnson was no scrub however as he held his own on the offensive end as well, going 11-24 from the field and having 25 points on the night.\n\nThe Suns won two out of their three games in Chicago but would eventually lose Game 6, leading to the Bulls winning their third straight title.\n\nKevin is still quite proud of the way he guarded Mike though, saying “Take that Mike!” on the podcast when speaking on keeping MJ below the scoring average he had when guarded by Dan.\n\nThe post Kevin Johnson Entered a Church to Pray Before Guarding Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "For the first time in four years, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander won't participate at NBA All-Star weekend. Once he was ruled out through the break with an abdominal strain, the reigning MVP's absence let out some air from the balloon in a three-day event that highlights the league's best players.\n\nAlperen Sengun has replaced Gilgeous-Alexander as a 2026 NBA All-Star injury replacement. He will take his spot on Team World in the three-team round-robin tournament that replaces Sunday's traditional All-Star Game.\n\nSengun's NBA All-Star teammates are Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Victor Wembanyama, Karl-Anthony Towns, Jamal Murray, Deni Avdija and Pascal Siakam.\n\nSengun joins teammate Kevin Durant for the star-studded event. Both will represent the Houston Rockets. Just yesterday, the hospital Oklahoma City Thunder dropped a 112-106 loss to them. Sengun had a 17-point, 12-rebound and 11-assist triple-double.\n\nThe Thunder continue to voyage through Gilgeous-Alexander's absence. So far, they're 0-2 in a five-game stretch. Never ideal to be without your best player, but sacrificing five games for three weeks off is pretty economical.\n\nThe Thunder will still be part of the NBA All-Star weekend extravaganza. Chet Holmgren will be part of Team USA stars. His teammates are Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Devin Booker, Tyrese Maxey, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Johnson and Jalen Duren.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 2026 NBA All-Star replacement revealed",

    "fullText": "One of the best stories recently in the NBA has been second-year former Trojan Isaiah Collier continuing to make the most of his opportunities. After Collier's career night, dishing out 22 assists, 17 points, and 3 steals, Collier built off that and led his team in scoring.\n\nThe Jazz have been without Keyonte George, and Collier is making up for the majority of his impact. Collier last night had a team-high 25 points, 11 assists, and 3 steals again. Collier has now had 5 straight games with a steal and a combined 13 steals in that span. It is not just his scoring output or his ability to find his teammates for good looks; he is also quite the defender.\n\nCollier is becoming more and more of a polished all-around basketball player. Any team, regardless of how deep the rotation is, can use a guy like Collier. He is proving to be extremely valuable for this team moving forward.\n\nThe Jazz are not looking to win games this season, even after the trade for star forward Jaren Jackson Jr. and ascending young players. This team wants a shot at a top pick in the upcoming draft. This upcoming class is full of stars. Yet when you are not trying to win, it is important to allow your young guys an opportunity to develop and see which players will be building blocks for the future.\n\nNow, after his recent great production in his starts, Collier is proving to be one of the pieces for the Utah Jazz moving forward. He is now averaging 10 points, 7.1 assists per contest, and shooting 50% from the field. He may not likely be a starting player for the Jazz when this lineup is ready to contend, but he has definitely shown he will be a key contributor in the rotation. Heck, he has shown he can be a player that steps up when stars go down with injury.\n\nThe Utah Jazz are building some special, and part of that is because of how great the former USC Trojan Isaiah Collier has been this season. The Jazz may not get any real success this season, but the next season should be one in which conversations about the Jazz look very different.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Isaiah Collier is enhancing USC basketball brand in NBA with Jazz",

    "fullText": "The NBA MVP race is beginning to take real shape, with clear frontrunners separating themselves as the season moves past its midpoint. Betting odds now reflect not just raw statistics, but team success, narrative momentum, and nightly impact across the league. From established superstars to rising faces driving unexpected contenders, the MVP conversation is deeper than it first appears.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander sits comfortably atop the MVP futures market after back-to-back elite seasons and leading Oklahoma City to one of the league’s best records. His scoring prowess and all-around impact have triggered MVP buzz, and he’s continued to show growth as a facilitator and defender. The narrative around SGA as a legitimate back-to-back MVP contender has only strengthened as the Thunder emerge as a true title contender. Voters often reward both team success and statistical dominance, and he delivers on both fronts.\n\nNikola Jokić remains one of the most uniquely dominant players in NBA history — a perennial MVP presence with a rare combination of scoring, playmaking and rebounding for a center. Even with Denver not topping the standings, his efficiency and court vision keep him squarely in the award conversation. Jokic’s ability to influence winning in so many statistical areas makes him irresistible to a certain slice of voters. His experience and broad skill set mean he can surge late if Nuggets’ team performance improves.\n\nLuka Dončić continues his MVP-caliber rise in Los Angeles, producing gaudy scoring, assist and rebound numbers night after night. His March and April performances often define MVP narratives, and if he carries the Lakers deep into the standings, his odds will tighten. Dončić’s marketability and high-usage role give him a real story appeal with voters — a flashy star leading an iconic franchise. Sustained excellence and healthy availability position him as the most compelling challenger behind the favorites.\n\nCade Cunningham has steadily climbed MVP boards by turning Detroit into an unexpectedly strong team in the East. His balance of scoring, playmaking, and defensive improvement has transformed the Pistons into a top-tier squad. While Pistons’ overall reputation may lag behind some contenders, Cunningham’s leadership is undeniable. Should Detroit continue exceeding expectations, he stands to benefit significantly in MVP voting.\n\nJaylen Brown’s MVP case hinges on Boston’s success and consistency as a top East seed while carrying increased offensive responsibility. A gifted two-way wing, Brown’s metrics often reflect efficient scoring and defensive impact. If he sustains high usage with balanced efficiency and Celtics stay elite, his narrative will improve. Voters may reward his often underappreciated contributions if Brown becomes the clear focal point of a championship-level team.\n\nTyrese Maxey’s odds are long primarily due to team context — a 76ers squad that has struggled for consistency — but his individual production has been impressive. Known for his scoring outbursts and clutch shooting, Maxey can light up the stat sheet any night. For MVP consideration, sustained team success is critical, which currently limits his market position. Still, as a budding star, Maxey’s profile could rise if Philly shifts toward a more impactful regular season.\n\nAnthony Edwards has the raw star talent to climb MVP boards — elite scoring, athleticism and flair for big moments — but his MVP odds reflect team inconsistencies and limited playoff expectations. If Minnesota makes a leap into the top echelon of the West, his value proposition improves dramatically. Edwards’ personality and highlight-level scoring give him a narrative edge, but MVP voters typically balance that with team success. Watch for late-season surges to flip his standing.\n\nJalen Brunson’s MVP floor rests more on his excellence than his current team’s record position — the Knicks’ defensive identity doesn’t always translate to traditional MVP narratives. As a steady veteran leader with efficient scoring and playmaking, Brunson ticks many boxes, though sustaining this into MVP consideration requires Knicks to inch into elite territory. His narrative hinges on exceeding expectations with a gritty, team-first profile.\n\nDonovan Mitchell’s MVP odds reflect Cavs’ standing as competitive but not among the league’s elite, limiting his case despite strong perimeter scoring. Known for explosive offense, Mitchell still needs a breakout franchise season to garner MVP traction. If Cleveland shocks top franchises and Mitchell pushes them, his narrative could shift. Right now, he represents a long-shot with scoring appeal but modest MVP viability.\n\nKawhi Leonard’s MVP odds are more symbolic than realistic — injuries and limited availability make sustained MVP candidacy unlikely. When healthy, he’s a two-time Finals MVP and perennial All-Star with elite two-way impact. However, MVP awards rarely go to players with restricted games, especially given Clippers’ middling results. Leonard’s narrative is better suited to playoff impact than regular-season hardware.\n\nWhile the odds suggest a favorite, the MVP race is far from settled, especially with months of high-leverage basketball still ahead. Late-season surges, injuries, and shifts in the standings can dramatically reshape voter perception. As history has shown, the final stretch often decides who turns elite production into league-wide recognition.\n\nThe post NBA MVP odds as of February 6, 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Clippers were one of the hottest teams in the NBA heading into the trade deadline, and nobody saw what came next.\n\nAfter rattling off a 16-3 stretch that pulled them from the bottom of the Western Conference standings all the way into play-in position, the front office decided to blow it up.\n\nIn the span of just a few days, the Clippers moved their second- and third-best players, James Harden and Ivica Zubac, turning what looked like a late-season push into a full-blown rebuild on the fly.\n\nThe Clippers now sit at 23-27 on the season and are left with more questions than answers as they head into All-Star Weekend as the host team at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe first domino fell on Tuesday when the Clippers sent 11-time All-Star James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for two-time All-Star Darius Garland and a second-round pick.\n\nHarden had been the engine that kept Los Angeles afloat all season, averaging 25.4 points and 8.1 assists per game while carrying the team through a brutal 6-21 start.\n\nHe was having his best scoring season in six years, so the move caught almost everyone off guard.\n\nBREAKING: The Los Angeles Clippers are trading James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Darius Garland and a second-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Prolific swap of the star point guards. pic.twitter.com/IHhhhabJnX\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 4, 2026\n\nFor the Clippers, though, it was about looking ahead.\n\nGarland is 10 years younger than Harden and is locked into a long-term deal that runs through 2028-29.\n\nHe is recovering from a toe injury that has kept him out since January 14, but when healthy he is a strong scorer and playmaker who averaged 20.6 points and 6.7 assists last season.\n\nClippers president Lawrence Frank said the team is \"trying to get younger while continuing to win,\" and Garland fits that goal on both ends.\n\nThe Clippers were not done there. On Thursday, they sent starting center Ivica Zubac and forward Kobe Brown to the Indiana Pacers in a deal that brought back a big haul of young talent and draft picks.\n\nLos Angeles received Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, two first-round picks and a second-round pick in return.\n\nFULL TRADE DETAILS:\n\nPacers receive:\nIvica Zubac\nKobe Brown\n\nClippers receive:\nBenedict Mathurin\nIsaiah Jackson\n2 1st-round picks\n2nd-round pick pic.twitter.com/iCAvemn9ls\n\n— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) February 5, 2026\n\nZubac had been the longest-tenured Clipper on the roster, having joined the team back in 2019 after being traded from the cross-town rival Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe was putting up 14.4 points and 11.0 rebounds per game this season while shooting over 61 percent from the floor, and he was coming off a career year in 2024-25 that earned him All-Defensive Second Team honors.\n\nThe centerpiece coming back is Mathurin, a 23-year-old wing who has been averaging 17.8 points per game this season and gives Los Angeles the kind of young scoring talent they will need going forward.\n\nThe draft capital is a big part of this, too. The Pacers' 2026 first-round pick is protected 1-4 and 10-30, which means the Clippers only get it if it falls between the fifth and ninth picks.\n\nIndiana currently has one of the worst records in the league, so there is close to a coin flip chance it lands in that range. If it does not, it turns into an unprotected 2031 first-rounder from Indiana, and the Clippers also picked up an unprotected 2029 first from the Pacers.\n\nWhat makes the timing so shocking is that the Clippers had just gone on that incredible 16-3 run and seemed to have real momentum going.\n\nThe Clippers pivoted HARD and turned James Harden and Ivica Zubac into:\n\n- Darius Garland\n- Bennedict Mathurin\n- Two first-round picks, including a potential lottery pick.\n\nHats off to the front office.\n\n— Grant \"Money\" Mona (@Gmona48) February 5, 2026\n\nThey had the oldest roster in the NBA this season with six core players aged 31 or older, and the front office clearly decided that a possible first-round exit in the playoffs was not worth passing up the chance to get younger and stockpile assets.\n\nKawhi Leonard will remain with the team for now, but his future in Los Angeles will be a major talking point this offseason.\n\nFor a franchise that came into the year swinging for the fences with a veteran-heavy roster, this was a pivot that nobody expected, and the ripple effects will be felt for years to come.\n\nFor now, though, it is a new era in Inglewood.",

    "fullText": "Charlotte Hornets waive former NBA Champion guard originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets have waived guard Pat Connaughton, the team announced Wednesday night.\n\nConnaughton has played in 22 games this season, averaging 2.9 points and 1.4 rebounds. He's shot a career-high 40.7% from three in his limited action.\n\nThe move opens a roster spot for guard Tyus Jones, who the Hornets acquired from the Orlando Magic on Wednesday.\n\nMore:Former Hornets center could be on the move from Phoenix\n\nConnaughton was on a $9.4 million contract, which expires if he's not claimed by another team within two days.\n\nIt's been another busy trade deadline for Hornets General Manager Jeff Peterson. Charlotte also acquired Coby White from the Chicago Bulls for Collin Sexton and sent Mason Plumlee to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nThe moves give the Hornets more depth in the backcourt behind star guards LaMelo Ball and Kon Knueppel. Veteran guard Tre Mann is also on the roster but has seen a diminished role this season.\n\nThis was Connaughton's first season in Charlotte after being acquired from the Milwaukee Bucks last July. The Hornets sent Vasilije Micic to Milwaukee for Connaughton and two second-round picks.\n\nHe's best known for his seven-year run with the Bucks, where he won an NBA Championship in 2021. He was a steady contributor in Milwaukee, playing 20+ minutes per game in five seasons.\n\nConnaughton, an 11-year NBA veteran, could be a solid depth addition for a contending team. He's shot over 37% from three in four seasons and has plenty of playoff experience.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Peterson and Charlotte will make more moves ahead of Thursday's deadline. Center could be a position to monitor, as the Hornets only have two centers on standard contracts.\n\nTracking every deal from 2026 NBA trade deadline\n\nDraymond Green takes another swipe at Dillon Brooks\n\nJared McCain trade allows 76ers to make several key roster moves\n\nDerrick Jones Jr., Isaac Okoro among Lakers trade targets\n\nClippers reportedly declined Celtics offer for Ivica Zubac",

    "fullText": "It’s that time of year in the NBA when goodbyes echo around the league, with teammates forced to bid farewell to some of the most influential figures in the locker room. For Anthony Edwards in 2025, it meant saying goodbye to Mike Conley Jr., a veteran who had been instrumental in the Minnesota Timberwolves’ recent rise in the league.\n\nConley had a rollercoaster 24 hours. He was first traded to the Chicago Bulls, who just one day later, sent him to the Charlotte Hornets. But that may not be the end of this trade-deadline adventure, as there’s a chance he may have to pack his bags again.\n\nEdwards, after the Timberwolves’ victory over the Toronto Raptors earlier today, admitted to hearing that the organization can try to get him back. As a result, he decided to do his part.\n\nConley joined the Wolvesin 2023 and quickly became one of the leaders in the locker room as they made two trips to the Conference Finals. In particular, helped Edwards a lot when he was struggling.\n\n“Mike man, he’s an OG. Always helped me when I was struggling on court. Great conversations off the court, great dude overall,” Edwards said.\n\nThe trade deadline day can be brutal. Players who have been comfortable in a city for years may be forced to move to the other side of the country and turn their lives upside down in a matter of hours. For Conley, he’s already traveled from Minneapolis to Chicago and on to Charlotte.\n\nSo, due to the Andrew Bogut rule, given that he’s been traded twice in the span of 24 hours, he can now return to the original team that he left. Seem as though Edwards keeps hoping that he flies right back home.\n\n“I keep hearing he can come back, so hopefully he will, and I hope he sees this,” Edwards said. “We want you back, Mike. He knows we miss him.”\n\nThe Timberwolves organization would ideally love to bring someone of Conley’s stature back. He wasn’t playing much in 25/26, but had an invaluable veteran presence. And if Edwards, arguably the cornerstone of Minnesota, asks the front office to try to make a move for him again, they would at least give it a try.\n\nThe post “We Want You Back”: Anthony Edwards Sends Heartfelt Message to “OG” Mike Conley appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Rivalries are the backbone of the NBA. Rivals Week just passed, but the lineup wasn’t up to par. Some fan-favorite matchups are missing, such as the Spurs and Thunder, or the historic Celtics and Lakers, built off the backs of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\n\nPlayer rivalries build team rivalries. Seeing players go head-to-head to prove who’s the best is what makes the NBA the most entertaining.\n\nWith that being said, here are the four best player rivalries currently taking place in the NBA:\n\nAnytime Lebron faces off with Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, it’s still a marquee matchup. LeBron, Durant, and Curry are a callback to an era now passed. Every time the NBA begins a new season, fans know they are that much closer to these show-stopping battles are coming to an end.\n\nThat means every game is a must-watch. When any combination of these three go head-to-head, it’s apparent how badly they each want to come out victorious over the other.\n\nFrom Finals matchups to random regular-season contests, each of the three give their all when they step on the court against each other.\n\nA different side of LeBron comes out when he faces Dillon Brooks. We’ve never seen a player get under the King’s skin like the Phoenix Suns guard. This rivalry has been filled with trash talk, physical confrontations, and heated moments.\n\nBrooks is averaging a career high of 21.1 points per game and elevates his play every time he goes up against the Lakers. Los Angeles’ last matchup with the Suns ended in a blowout.\n\nIt seems like Brooks has made it his personal mission to mess with the Hall of Famer, and fans are eagerly awaiting their next duel.\n\nChet Holmgren going up against Victor Wembanyama has been one of the NBA’s most compelling feuds as of late.\n\nSince Wembanyama entered the NBA, he and Chet have had a budding rivalry. The two towering figures first faced off in the 2021 FIBA World Cup, where Holmgren and Team USA walked out with the win.\n\nThe Spurs seem to have the Thunder’s number this year, as they’ve beaten them three times this season. It feels like Wembanyama circles every Thunder game on his calendar.\n\nWembanyama is on a mission to prove he’s far and away the best young center in the NBA. The Spurs’ phenom is a generational talent, but Holmgren has something he doesn’t: a championship ring.\n\nEdwards Vs. SGA is a heavyweight fight with the title for best guard in the NBA on the line. The intensity always reaches a fever pitch when these two play each other. The two players mirror each other in many ways. Both became leaders of their team at a relatively young age and became stars around the same time.\n\nAnt and SGA have taken subtle shots at each other through shoe commercials. It’s clear they both have immense respect for each other, but are fighting to be the best. The Timberwolves have won two out of three matchups with the Thunder this season, but these two will be battling it out for years to come.\n\nAttention player haters and disbelievers of all kinds… pic.twitter.com/5tzoBwvUZ4\n\n— adidas Basketball (@adidasHoops) October 24, 2025\n\nThe post What Are the Best Player Rivalries In the NBA Today? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James has offered a fascinating insight into how a legendary WWE heel turn helped shape one of the most controversial chapters of his NBA career.\n\nAfter all, the Los Angeles Lakers star explained that his time with the Miami Heat was influenced by an unlikely wrestling icon.\n\nJames’ decision to embrace the villain role after leaving Cleveland in 2010 transformed how fans viewed him, and he has since acknowledged that the reaction was not only anticipated but studied.\n\nSpeaking on a recent episode of the Mind the Game podcast, LeBron revealed that the late WWE legend Hulk Hogan played a key role in how he understood fame, backlash, and reinvention.\n\n“I grew up watching Hulk Hogan. At one point, Hulk Hogan was like America, as everyone loved him. What it means to be an American.\n\nThen one day, he went to N.W.O. and people couldn’t understand how he tagged up with the enemy,” James said.\n\nHe added: “They were like, ‘What is going on?’ Everybody just booed him. He went from wearing red and yellow to black and white.”\n\nHogan’s infamous switch from beloved hero to villain in the 1990s stunned wrestling fans and redefined his career.\n\nLeBron saw clear parallels when he joined forces with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, a move that instantly made him the league’s most polarising figure.\n\nLeBron explained that accepting the villain label was partly about understanding entertainment as much as competition.\n\n“One, we’re entertainers as well… Listen, we want to go out and have fun, smile and be happy because that’s what brings us joy,” James continued.\n\nHe concluded, stating: “But we can tap into the Joker role if y’all make us, now. We can get there too now, and still be able to perform at a high level.”\n\nDuring his Miami Heat years, James leaned into the boos, the black uniforms, and the perception that he was basketball’s ultimate antagonist.\n\nRather than fighting public sentiment, he channelled it. The result was one of the most dominant stretches of his career, with championships, MVPs, and a sharpened edge that defined a new version of LeBron.\n\nMuch like Hogan’s transformation elevated professional wrestling, LeBron’s embrace of the villain role reshaped the NBA’s modern era. It was controversial, deliberate, and ultimately successful.\n\nLeBron James sends message to Wesley Bryan while explaining his recent golf obsession\n\nDillon Brooks calls LeBron James NBA’s most overrated player to renew rivalry\n\nRich Paul claims LeBron James turned Cleveland into ‘Hollywood of the Midwest’",

    "fullText": "The 2025–26 NBA season delivered a fresh wave of breakout stars, with six players earning their first All-Star selections through sustained growth and undeniable impact. Each of these players took a meaningful leap, either by expanding their offensive responsibilities, anchoring a defense, or becoming indispensable to their team’s identity. Together, they represent the league’s constant evolution and the reward that comes from opportunity meeting preparation.\n\nDeni Avdija breaks new ground as one of the league’s most complete two-way forwards this season. His All-Star nod reflects a career-high scoring uptick and unprecedented playmaking for a Trail Blazers forward, putting him among the rare players averaging 25+ points, 7+ rebounds, and 6+ assists. Beyond the counting stats, Avdija’s selection is historic: he’s the first NBA All-Star from Israel, showcasing his rapid ascent and growing global impact. His versatile game has been a key factor for Portland’s competitiveness this season.\n\nJalen Duren has emerged as a true interior force for the Detroit Pistons, anchoring both ends of the court with energy and efficiency. This first All-Star selection comes as a result of his elite rebounding and inside scoring, where he ranks among the league’s best in key paint-dominant metrics. Duren’s physicality sets the tone for Detroit defensively, and his offensive improvements have made him a reliable secondary scoring option. His trajectory suggests he could become one of the NBA’s premier big men for years to come.\n\nChet Holmgren’s All-Star breakthrough signifies the Thunder’s rise defensively and his unique impact on both ends of the floor. In just his third NBA season, he’s developed into a disruptive rim protector while continuing to expand his scoring and rebounding prowess. Holmgren’s combination of size, agility, and shooting range makes him a matchup problem and a centerpiece of OKC’s identity. His inclusion among the league’s elite this year highlights how integral he’s become to his team’s success\n\nBack at full health after a season cut short by injury, Jalen Johnson has taken a massive leap to become one of the Hawks’ central playmakers. His All-Star selection reflects career-high production across scoring, rebounding, and facilitating, with a rare all-around stat line that puts him in elite company. Johnson’s athleticism and versatility have given Atlanta a multi-dimensional threat on offense and a disruptive presence on defense. This first All-Star appearance underscores his growth into a franchise cornerstone.\n\nJamal Murray’s first All-Star nod comes after years of high-impact performances that previously went unrecognized in the midseason showcase. This season represents a personal best on both ends of the court, where he’s set new marks in scoring, assists, and shooting efficiency. Murray’s knack for clutch play and generating offense has been vital for the Nuggets, especially during stretches without Nikola Jokić. His breakthrough honors reflect the high-level consistency he’s brought to Denver’s lineup.\n\nAt 32 years old, Norman Powell’s first All-Star selection is a testament to perseverance and gradual refinement of his game. In Miami, Powell has become a primary scoring threat, putting up career-best numbers while leading one of the highest-scoring offenses in the league. His sharpshooting and ability to take over games in isolation have made him an X-factor for the Heat. This long-awaited recognition rewards years of hard-earned development and situational excellence.\n\nThese first-time All-Stars didn’t arrive by accident; their selections reflect seasons defined by consistency, resilience, and expanded roles. From young cornerstones announcing their arrival to veterans finally receiving overdue recognition, this group captures multiple paths to All-Star status. As the league continues to shift, the 2025–26 class stands as a snapshot of the NBA’s next phase and the players shaping it.\n\nThe post NBA: First-time All-Stars for 2025-2026 season appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Intuit Dome will have an All-Star playing on his home floor, after all.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard has been named to the NBA All-Star Game by commissioner Adam Silver, the league announced Tuesday afternoon. Leonard was originally left off the roster after he wasn't voted in by the fans, media or players as a starter or coaches as a reserve, but the teams were a player short under the new format.\n\nThis year's All-Star Game will be \"USA vs. the World.\" Three teams -- two teams of American players and one team of international players -- will compete against each other in a round robin-style tournament on Sunday, Feb. 15. Leonard's addition brings the total number of U.S. All-Stars to 16, the minimum required.\n\nThere was some backlash online after Leonard, who's averaging a career-high 27.6 points per game, 6.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists and a league-leading 2.06 steals in 36 games played this season.  He's also been as efficient as he's ever been, shooting 49.7%, 39.1% from three-point range and has the fourth-best free throw percentage in the league at 91.3%.\n\nThis will be Leonard's seventh career All-Star selection.\n\nPer the NBA's statement, the All-Star teams will be revealed at 4 p.m. PT Tuesday night on Peacock during the pregame show ahead of the Boston Celtics-Dallas Mavericks game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard selected for NBA All-Star Game",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Clippers superstar Kawhi Leonard was considered to be one of the most shocking omission from the 2026 NBA West All-Star roster this season. When the reserve players for both conferences were announced on Sunday, the list did not include Leonard.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Leonard was added to the Western Conference’s roster, according to NBA insider Shams Charania. Leonard is the 16th U.S. All-Star, which is the minimum requirement. The initial group of 24 All-Stars had only 15 U.S. All-Stars.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard has been selected to the 2026 NBA All-Star Game. After the selection of the initial 24 All-Stars, Leonard was added to bring the total number of U.S. All-Stars to 16, the minimum required.\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 3, 2026\n\nLeonard will be a reserve player for the Western Conference alongside the following seven players:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards\n\nDenver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray\n\nOklahoma City Thunder center Chet Holmgren\n\nHouston Rockets forward Kevin Durant\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Devin Booker\n\nPortland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija\n\nThe West Conference starters will be Los Angeles Lakers forward-guard Luka Doncic, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, San Antonio Spurs forward Victor Wembanyama, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokić and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry.\n\nThis is Leonard’s seventh NBA All-Star selection of his career. He is the only Clippers player to have earned an All-Star selection this season.\n\nThe Western Conference is filled with superstars, but Leonard has been one of the top players in the NBA since defeating the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 20. He has led the Clippers out of a 6-21 rut and now the team is 23-26.\n\nAlthough many believed Leonard should have been named an All-Star initially, the two-time NBA champion told reporters he was not expecting to earn the honor after the Clippers’ game against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday.\n\n“It’s never an expectation for me. I was a guy that had to work my way into those conversations. It is what it is. I’m gonna enjoy my time,” Leonard said, per Joey Linn on X.\n\nKawhi Leonard last night on his All-Star snub:\n\n“It’s never an expectation for me.

    "fullText": "The former UVA star picked up right where he left off last season.\n\nAfter missing the first 46 games of the season due to a lingering calf strain, former Virginia Cavaliers star Ty Jerome is finally back in action and already winning over a new fanbase.\n\nIt was a disappointing start to the season for Jerome, who broke out last year with the Cleveland Cavaliers to the tune of 19.9 points and 7.0 assists per game, leading to a third-place finish in the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Voting.\n\nJerome’s impressive campaign earned him a three-year, $27 million deal with the Memphis Grizzlies in July, but his Grind City debut was pushed back until the final day of January for the first of a pair of home games against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe 2019 National Champion has quickly made up for lost time, scoring a team-high 20 points in Saturday’s 131-114 loss before following it up with a 19-point, 8-assist, 6-rebound performance on Monday night in a 137-128 rematch win over the T-Wolves.\n\nDespite playing just 20 minutes in each of his first two appearances for Memphis due to a minutes restriction, Jerome is already bringing stability to a Grizzlies backcourt that has dealt with injuries and inconsistency throughout the season. Jerome is shooting 54.5% from the field while showing off his trademark deliberate pace and elite decision-making as Memphis’s floor general.\n\n“[Jerome] doesn’t look like the most explosive guy, but he gets to his spots on the floor because he reads so well the body language of not only his own defender but also the helping defenders,” said Grizzlies head coach Tuomas Iisalo to the media after Monday night’s win. “He’s actually so good that he can manipulate [defenders] to get out of the space that he wants to create or get into the space that he wants to create for someone else.”\n\nWith Jerome sidelined and several other key players (including 2x All-Star Ja Morant, who has missed 28 games this season) in and out of the lineup, the Grizzlies went just 18-28 in their first 46 games, leaving them currently three games out of the play-in equation in the Western Conference.\n\nIn other pro ’Hoos news, De’Andre Hunter made headlines over the weekend as he was dealt from the Cavaliers to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis ahead of February 5th’s NBA trade deadline.\n\nIt hasn’t been the season that many envisioned for Hunter, who averaged 14.0 points in 43 games this season with Cleveland on 42.3% shooting from the floor and a career-low 30.8% from beyond the arc. But a new home might be exactly what is needed for the 2019 fourth-overall pick. The Kings, which have a league-worst 12 wins this season, are in full-on tank mode, meaning we won’t be seeing Hunter back in the postseason this spring. However, Sacramento could be a perfect spot for the former ’Hoo to become an offensive focal point and once again show the league what he’s capable of in the right environment.",

    "description": "Seems like the Los Angeles Clippers could trade James Harden. Here are some potential landing spots before the NBA trade deadline.",
    "fullText": "James Harden has continued to be a huge help to the Los Angeles Clippers after the team's awful start, but he's sat out the past couple of games. Now? There's word via ESPN's Shams Charania that the Clips and Harden are \"working through whether the sides can find a deal by Thursday's trade deadline.\"\n\nEven at age 36, Harden is still averaging 25.4 ppg, 8.1 apg and 4.8 rpg. His contract situation? He's got a partially guaranteed contract this year and a player option for 2026-27. So that could be a factor for whomever acquires him.\n\nSo where could he go? Here's a list of some possible destinations as the 2026 NBA trade deadline approaches:\n\nThis is the team that's most linked to him, with Darius Garland heading to the Clippers. Why would the Cavs trade a much younger point guard? Well, maybe they think they have a shot at the Eastern Conference this season and perhaps they don't think Garland could be worth the money he could earn soon.\n\nThey need a point guard and someone to take some heat off Anthony Edwards. This is a move that would help a lot given their issues at point guard with an aging Mike Conley.\n\nThis feels like a darkhorse. The Raps have a lot of young talent, but what if they deal someone (RJ Barrett, perhaps?) for Harden and win a playoff series with him? I honestly don't know if the Raptors feel like they need to interrupt the growth they have as a young roster, but on paper, it might make sense.\n\nI saw the most tweets about this one. Harden gets back with Kevin Durant, returns to the team where he broke out as an MVP. Maybe he's happy being back in Houston? If the Rockets want to keep pace in the super-competitive West, this would be the move.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: James Harden landing spots with NBA trade rumors swirling",

    "fullText": "With the NBA trade deadline approaching on Thursday, teams across the league are scrambling to assemble rosters they believe best position them for the future. The Los Angeles Clippers, for their part, are reportedly engaged in serious talks to send James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThis does not appear to be a situation where the Clippers were actively looking to move Harden. He has missed the team’s last two games for personal reasons, and it has long been understood that he carries significant influence over any potential trade destination. In short, Hardenwants a move away from LA.\n\nReports suggest the Cavaliers are willing to send Darius Garland to Inglewood in return, a move that would shift them down a path of youth. However, not everyone is convinced it makes sense for Cleveland, with Emmanuel Acho emerging as one of the more vocal critics of the potential deal.\n\nThe Clippers, after languishing at the bottom of the West for the first few weeks of the 25/26 season, are creeping up the standings and are currently 9th with a 23-26 record. The Cavs, meanwhile, are 5th in the East and looking to rediscover the form that helped them finish #1 in their conference last season. Acho warned them on Speakeasy that signing Harden won’t help them achieve that.\n\n“I would not want James Harden if I were a championship-caliber team,” the former NFL player turned sports pundit declared. “Nothing about James Harden spells Championship. Nothing about James Harden’s career spells Championship. He is all the way over the hill, and James Harden has never been a catalyst for winning championships.”\n\nThese may seem like harsh comments, but Acho has a point. He noted how Harden has never helped a team get close to winning a championship, and the only time a team looked deadly with him in the roster was when he was a 6th man in Oklahoma. He failed to deliver success in Houston (ran into prime Warriors to be fair), Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and finally, Los Angeles.\n\n“When he’s ever had to be that guy, he’s not that,” Acho added. “So, why in the world would anybody want to trade for James Harden if they actually have championship aspirations?”\n\nWell, it looks like Harden has championship aspirations for starters. There’s a reason he’s switched teams so many times in the 2020s. It’s not working out anywhere, but he refuses to give up. He’s averaging 25.4 points per game and assisting 8.1. His playmaking has also significantly improved over the years.\n\nWill teaming up with Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley finally give him the fairytale ending he’s hoping for? We’ll have to wait and see.\n\nThe post “Nothing About James Harden Spells Champion”: Emmanuel Acho Goes Off Following Clippers-Cavaliers Trade Story appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Monday night in the NBA delivered drama in different ways. One team erased a huge deficit. Another leaned on a single star to survive without key players. Long losing streaks ended, and winning streaks came to a stop. Every game shifted the mood in the standings and showed which teams are finding answers and which ones are still searching.\n\nCharlotte earned its seventh straight win after erasing a 22-point deficit. LaMelo Ball showed toughness after a head collision with coach Charles Lee caused an eye cut. He returned quickly and finished with 24 points. Kon Knueppel scored 17 and hit four three-pointers. Brandon Miller and Grant Williams added 16 each. The Hornets survived 17 turnovers and poor three-point shooting in the first half. Ball’s drive and dunk in the fourth gave Charlotte the lead. Miller later stole the ball from Herbert Jones and finished with a one-handed dunk. The win pulled Charlotte within a half-game of Atlanta for the final play-in spot.\n\nNew Orleans could not hold a strong first-half lead. Trey Murphy III led with 27 points. Zion Williamson had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Derik Queen added 16. Ball’s injury did not slow Charlotte enough. Defensive pressure hurt the Pelicans late. The loss marked their sixth defeat in nine games. New Orleans struggled to stop dribble drives in the fourth quarter.\n\nHouston won despite missing Kevin Durant and Steven Adams. Alperen Sengun carried the load with 39 points and 16 rebounds. Jabari Smith Jr. added 19. Sengun made 13 of 25 shots and 13 of 18 free throws. Eight of those free throws came in the fourth quarter. The Rockets used a late 12-2 run to seal the game. A replay decision wiped out a possible Pacers buzzer-beater before halftime and shifted momentum. Houston earned its third straight win and third straight road victory.\n\nIndiana could not finish strong after a comeback push. Pascal Siakam scored 27 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 25. The Pacers briefly led in the third quarter after a fast-break pass from Jarace Walker to Siakam. Sengun’s free throws ended their hopes. The team missed a chance to extend its winning streak to three games. Defensive fouls in the final minutes proved costly.\n\nMemphis snapped a six-game losing streak with sharp shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 30 points. Ty Jerome had 19. Jaylen Wells added 18. Cam Spencer and Vince Williams Jr. scored 16 each. Three-point shooting changed the game after a poor effort two nights earlier. Memphis went 8 of 15 from deep in the first half. A 20-point lead formed in the second half. Early fourth-quarter threes pushed the margin to 20 again. The Grizzlies stayed ahead even when Minnesota tried to rally.\n\nMinnesota could not repeat its strong showing from Saturday. Anthony Edwards led with 39 points and seven rebounds. Jaden McDaniels scored 29. Donte DiVincenzo had 21, including 13 in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves never got closer than nine points late. Their four-game winning streak came to an end. Defensive breakdowns on the perimeter hurt them early.\n\nPhiladelphia stayed hot with a fourth straight win. Tyrese Maxey scored 29 and hit seven three-pointers. Dominick Barlow posted 26 points and 16 rebounds. Joel Embiid added 24 as he worked back from injury. The Sixers led from start to finish and built a 23-point cushion. A 72-53 halftime lead set the tone. The team improved to 11-10 without Paul George. Balanced scoring and steady defense kept control all night.\n\nLos Angeles missed James Harden for a second straight game. Kawhi Leonard led with 29 points. Jordan Miller added 21 off the bench. Short runs in the fourth quarter failed to change the outcome. Leonard finished on the bench as the gap stayed wide. The Clippers remain in the play-in chase but could not match Philadelphia’s energy.\n\nFebruary 2 produced wins that mattered beyond the final score. Charlotte proved it can fight back under pressure. Houston showed it can win even when short-handed. Memphis finally broke through after weeks of frustration. Philadelphia kept its steady climb going. For the losing teams, the night exposed problems with closing games and protecting leads. With the season moving fast, these results could shape who stays alive in the NBA playoff race and who falls behind.\n\nThe post NBA results: February 2, 2026 – winners and losers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "NBA trade deadline tracker: Latest news, rumors for Giannis Antetokounmpo and more in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nList of NBA trades completes at deadline\n\nNBA trade deadline deals by team\n\nWhen is the NBA trade deadline in 2026?\n\nThe NBA trade deadline is undoubtedly among the most engaging moments within the entire sports calendar.\n\nThe Thursday 3 p.m. ET cutoff for trade agreements is expected to spur considerable activity as it approaches.\n\nTeams are required to finalize their rosters by this deadline before the final phase of the regular season. This year's deadline is particularly intense, with numerous high-profile players rumored to be on the trading block.\n\nAs the activity intensifies, The Sporting News will monitor rumors, news, and reported transactions leading up to the deadline. Due to the nature of these deals, some may be announced following the deadline.\n\nContinue to follow this coverage to remain informed of all developments.\n\nFischer adds that the two sides seem resigned to a separation after eight years together, although that is more likely to come in the offseason when James hits free agency.\n\n\"The most aggressive team in the West right now is the Minnesota Timberwolves,\" said Brian Windhorst. \"They are in the game for Giannis, and the Timberwolves are being aggressive. If they don't make what I would call a Hail Mary Giannis deal, I think they are aggressively looking to upgrade their backcourt.\"\n\nShams Charania also appeared on ESPN and shared the same reports that Minnesota is indeed one of the most aggressive teams in the NBA when it comes to acquiring Antetokounmpo.\n\nJackson reported that the Miami Heat are expected to offer an extensive trade package for Antetokounmpo. The offer is anticipated to be Tyler Herro, Kel'el Ware, Terry Rozier, young players, 2 1st-round picks and 3 pick swaps, per Jackson. If the Bucks do happen to acquire Rozier, they will have to pay his entire 25-26 salary.\n\nA day after The Athletic reported that the Knicks are inquiring about Antetokounmpo, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on \"Get Up\" Monday morning that, \"The Knicks believe in this team.. They believed in this team last summer when Giannis was loosely available in those discussions. They didn't make an aggressive offer at the time of those talks. If they want to win a bidding war now, i think its going to take a 3 or 4 team trade.... That is just not happening. They are not showing that aggression to get Giannis right now and I think thats because they like this team.\"\n\nWhile other teams have been mentioned far more often, the Trail Blazers are among the franchises interested in Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Oregonian reports. The report adds that new owner Tom Dundon is ready and willing to take big swings to win, which makes Portland a wild card in the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes even if a deal might cost All-Star Deni Avdija.\n\nThe Kings still have salary cap concerns despite an abysmal 12-39 record, and ESPN reports that has prompted Sacramento explore trades involving Zach LaVine, Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Malik Monk. The Kings acquired De’Andre Hunter from the Cavaliers on Saturday.\n\nThe Knicks are one of the teams inquiring about Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Athletic reports, but the Knicks’ inability to fully match what Milwaukee is demanding — premier young players and high draft picks — is a hurdle.\n\nKnicks big man Karl-Anthony Towns is still a trade candidate despite New York’s recent resurgence, The Athletic reports. Towns hasn’t been extended and reportedly has had some hard feelings ever since his name surfaced in Giannis Antetokounmpo trade talks in the offseason.\n\nThe Knicks have “long been trying to find a new home” for forward Guerschon Yabusele, who has struggled since signing in the offseason. Yabusele could need draft assets attached to him to be dealt, The Athletic reports.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading guard Vit Krejci to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Duop Reath and two future second-round selections. The move gives the Hawks the ability to free up roster space, and Atlanta now possesses seven upcoming second-round picks.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are trading De'Andre Hunter to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis. This transaction involves three teams: the Chicago Bulls acquire Kings forward Dario Saric and two future second-round draft picks. Additionally, the Bulls are waiving guard Jevon Carter to make room for Saric, according to sources. They also acted as a third team and acquired assets to complete the trade.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading four-time NBA All-Star Trae Young to the Washington Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert. The Hawks kick off the trade deadline season with a bang.\n\nCJ McCollum (G) - traded from Wizards\n\nCorey Kispert (F) - traded from Wizards\n\nDuop Reath (C) - traded from Trail Blazers\n\nDario Saric (F) - traded from Kings\n\nDennis Schroder (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nKeon Ellis (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nVit Krejci (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nDe'Andre Hunter (F) - traded from Cavs\n\nTrae Young (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nThe 2026 NBA trade deadline is at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 5.\n\nIt is important to note that the deadline is 3 p.m. ET and whatever corresponding time that is for teams in other time zones.

    "description": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. did not make the 2026 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday and social media reacted to his unexpected snub.",
    "fullText": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. was thought at one point in time to be one of the players that was going to make the All-Star Game for the first time in his career given the season that he's had to this point. In anticipation of Porter being Brooklyn's first All-Star since the 2021-22 season (Kevin Durant), there were plenty of questions asked of the organization regarding the honor, until it was revealed that Porter would not be named an All-Star after all.\n\nOn Sunday, around the same time that the Nets tipped off for what ended up being their 130-77 loss at the Detroit Pistons, it was reported by various insiders that Porter did not make the 2026 Eastern Conference All-Star team as a reserve. While there seemed to be virtual locks to make the team as a reserve, such as Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell and Atlanta Hawks forward Jalen Johnson, Porter was considered by many to be among that group due to his impact on Brooklyn this season.\n\nThe reserves for the East are Mitchell, Johnson, New York Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns, Indiana Pacers forward Pascal Siakam, Miami Heat guard Norman Powell, Toronto Raptors forward Scottie Barnes, and Detroit Pistons center Jalen Duren. Those seven players will join the five starters in Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey, Knicks guard Jalen Brunson, Pistons guard Cade Cunningham, Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, and Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nWow, I really thought Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. was going to the All-Star Game. My guess is that the voting came down to Porter and Pacers forward Pascal Siakam. https://t.co/09uVZSckSk\n\n— Sharif Phillips-Keaton (@SharifKeaton) February 1, 2026\n\nPorter, 27, is having the best season of his career as he is averaging 25.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game while shooting 48.2% from the field and 39.8% from three-point land in 38 appearances. While Brooklyn (13-34) has one of the worst records in the Eastern Conference, part of Porter's case was the fact that the Nets are just 1-9 without him in the lineup, demonstrating his importance to the team.\n\nWhile Porter didn't make the All-Star team despite the push by many to see him be among the players making an All-Star appearance for the first time in their career, that doesn't take away from the fact that he's having a terrific season and he's far from the only snub. Here's how social media reacted to Porter being snubbed from the 2026 NBA All-Star Game:\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is an incredible snub from the All-Star Game.\n\nThe Eastern Conference coaches should be ashamed that they voted based on reputation and/or team record. We have metrics in 2026 to capture the impact on winning from individuals rather than lazily looking to team… https://t.co/abYtZ95IXZ pic.twitter.com/bXQ6pCcMJf\n\n— Billy Reinhardt (@BillyReinhardt) February 1, 2026\n\nPlayers with 25+ PPG that didn't make the All-Star game:\n\n— Lauri Markkanen\n— Kawhi Leonard\n— Michael Porter Jr\n— James Harden pic.twitter.com/puAt8lyrIq\n\n— StatMuse (@statmuse) February 1, 2026\n\nAs Michael Porter Jr. didn't make the NBA All-Star Reserves this season, @NancyNewmanYES and @TheFrankIsola share their thoughts.#NETSonYES pic.twitter.com/8sf15Ngqll\n\n— YES Network (@YESNetwork) February 2, 2026\n\nMichael Porter Jr. did not make the Eastern Conference All-Star team. \n\nThe numbers say he should have. https://t.co/o44RQCCvvx pic.twitter.com/VowKJwI0Iz\n\n— C.J.

    "fullText": "After missing around a month of NBA action, Nikola Jokic returned to the court on January 30th against the Los Angeles Clippers, and he looked a hundred percent like his old self. The only problem was that he didn’t play as long as he normally would, and that irked Charles Barkley.\n\nThe Nuggets won 122-109 against the Clippers, and Jokic scored 31 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. It was business as usual for the Joker, whose return will only bolster the Denver Nuggets’ post-season hopes. The crowd and pundits seemed to miss seeing Jokic’s greatness on display, which is why Barkleybizarrely called for David Adelman’s head for limiting the Serbian’s minutes.\n\nJokic‘s incredible stat line was a result of just 25 minutes of basketball action. Barkley feels — and rightly so — that he could have done a lot more. The punishment for Adelman? Fire him.\n\n“I gotta call out coach Adelman,” Barkley said on ESPN. “He gave this guy 25 minutes; he would have had 40… We gotta get rid of coach Adelman. He holding this dude back.”\n\n“This dude should have had 40-15-7… He can’t even get his triple-double on cuz he played half the game,” the Round Mound of Rebounds added.\n\nOf course, he was joking. No coach would be fired simply for restricting their star player’s minutes, especially after returning from a long-term injury. Jokic missed 16 games with a knee injury he suffered on December 29. Now, he is back and will slowly, but surely, play more minutes to satisfy Barkley and others.\n\nThe Nuggets looked fine without Jokic as well, which makes them an even scarier team. They went 10-6 in his absence, establishing themselves as a genuine contender in the Western Conference.\n\nUnfortunately, Jokic’s second game back was not as impressive. He scored just 16 points, grabbed seven rebounds, and recorded eight assists in a 121–111 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the top team in the NBA. He played four more minutes than he did against the Clippers, which once again shows that Adelmandoes not want to risk losing his best player to injury again this season.\n\nThe post Charles Barkley Jokingly Calls for Nuggets HC to Be Fired After “Holding” Nikola Jokic Back vs. Clippers appeared first on The SportsRush.",

While they were expected to be deadline sellers coming into the season, they’ve wildly surpassed expectations, going 31-18 and ranking second in net rating.\n\nAccordingly, the Celtics are more likely to be buyers than sellers this week given their place in the standings. However, they could still look to offload a player or two to clear up some payroll and open a spot for Jayson Tatum’s expected return.\n\nGiven the rumors and uncertainty, the trade deadline is always a stressful and anxious time for players, coaches and executives alike. Anything can happen.\n\nPrior to Sunday’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks, Joe Mazzulla revealed how he’s handling it this year.\n\nJoe Mazzulla emphasizes adhering to routine when asked about handling the days leading up to the trade deadline:\n\n“You just stick to the process every day.” pic.twitter.com/Kav4aJiviC\n\n— Bobby Krivitsky (@BobbyKrivitsky) February 1, 2026\n\n“You just stick to the process every day, what gives you a chance to win that particular day,” Mazzulla said during his pregame press conference. “Maximize the day. Is it a game day? Is it an off day? Is it a day where we gotta come in and watch film? Is it a day that we gotta practice? You just have to understand what day you’re at and make sure you put your focus on that.”\n\nThat type of focus should serve Mazzulla and his players well over the next few days. After destroying the Bucks on Sunday, they’re off on Monday before traveling to Texas for a back-to-back against the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets. Then they’re off on Thursday, the day of the deadline.\n\nMazzulla doesn’t get distracted easily, so look for him to stay locked in and keep his team prepared over the next few days as they look to get off to a strong start in February.\n\nJoe Mazzulla Reflects On Celtics Legacy Ahead Of NBA Pioneers Classic",

This performance surpassed the previous teenage scoring record of 45 points set by Cliff Robinson in 1980.\n\nEarlier in the season, on December 15, 2025, Flagg had already broken LeBron James' specific record for an 18-year-old by scoring 42 points against the Utah Jazz.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA All-Star game is changing once again.\n\nThe league has tinkered with different formats throughout the past few years, trying to inject excitement into a game that has lost its luster. Their latest change is the most dramatic. This year's game will feature a theme of America versus the World. The hope is that it adding an element of national pride will lead to more competitive play.\n\nNOH: My projected All-Star reserves for 2026\n\nThis year's game will feature a round robin tournament between two American teams and one World team. Each team will consist of at least eight players. Participants from both the Eastern and Western conference will be mixed among all three teams.\n\nIn the event that the 24 All-Stars are not divided evenly between 16 Americans and eight international players, commissioner Adam Silver will select players to the game until each team can field at least eight players. That may result in some teams that have more players than others.\n\nThere will be four games in total played, with each game lasting 12 minutes. In the round-robin tournament, Team A will play Team B in Game 1.  The winning team from Game 1 will take on Team C in Game 2, followed by the losing team of Game 1 meeting Team C in Game 3.\n\nAfter Game 3, the top two teams by record will advance to face each other in the championship game (Game 4).  If all three teams have a 1-1 record after Game 3, the tiebreaker would be point differential in each team’s two round-robin games.\n\nMORE: The 11 worst contracts in the NBA, based on my salary tool\n\nThe reserves will be announced on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nThe starters, who will be divided up among the three teams (two American, one World), have been announced and are as follows:\n\nAll-Star Weekend will take place from Friday, Feb. 13 to Sunday, Feb. 15.

    "fullText": "PHOENIX — Phoenix Suns guard Dillon Brooks has never shied away from honesty, and on Saturday, he was candid when asked who he believed was the most overrated player in the NBA.\n\nDec 23, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) moves the ball against Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks in the first half at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nBrooks was a guest on Twitch streamer N3on’s broadcast, as the duo drove around Phoenix and Brooks showed the streamer the Suns’ locker room and practice facility. At one point, N3on posed the question to Brooks, who answered without hesitation.\n\n“I would probably say Lebron [James] right now,” the Suns guard said. “I feel like he overrated right now, his time is coming to an end.”\n\nNeedless to say, the remark quickly went viral online. Within hours, Brooks’ honesty was met with a flurry of reactions from fans.\n\nThe comment marks another chapter in the rivalry Brooks and James have found themselves in this season. Both players have had their fair share of exchanges during games between the Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe most notable came in a Dec. 14 thriller, when the two spent much of the night jawing at each other before Brooks was ultimately ejected in the closing seconds after receiving his second technical foul following a confrontation with James after hitting a go-ahead 3-pointer.\n\nPhoenix would eventually fall to Los Angeles, 116-114.\n\nDec 1, 2025; Los Angeles, California, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) moves the ball against Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks (3) during the first half at Crypto.com Arena. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nAs a defining figure in the league for more than two decades, James has been one of the most accomplished players in NBA history. However, Brooks’ comments suggest he views James strictly as an on-court rival, regardless of his accolades.\n\nThe moment also reinforces Brooks’ reputation as an unapologetic edge-setter for the Suns. His confrontational persona has resonated with the fan base and, while it has occasionally led to foul trouble, it has also helped fuel Phoenix to much-needed wins and momentum.\n\nDec 14, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks (3) and Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) react during an altercation that resulted in a technical for Brooks during the second half of a game at the Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Allan Henry-Imagn Images\n\nWhether the remark draws a response from James or lingers into future matchups between the Western Conference rivals, Brooks continues to find himself at the center of the NBA’s national conversation.\n\nArizona State welcomes back former stars for ASU vs Arizona basketball showdown",

    "fullText": "Celtics' Payton Pritchard leads NBA in impressive stat originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPayton Pritchard is among the most underrated No. 3 scoring options in the league.\n\nThe 6-foot-1 Boston Celtics guard has done nothing but improve his game since entering the league in 2020, and with Jayson Tatum sidelined with an Achilles injury, he’s received a more significant offensive role with the 2024 NBA champions.\n\nAccording to the X/Twitter account 'Real App, ' Payton currently leads the NBA in an impressive stat.\n\n“Payton Pritchard has the most games in the NBA this season with 25+ points & zero free throws attempted,” the notable statistics-based account stated.\n\nWhy is that stat so admirable? Well, it’s common for players to erupt for 25+ points while attempting multiple free throws. In some cases, it’s so extreme that fans will throw out terms like ‘foul baiter’ and ‘free throw merchant’ to help diminish a player’s performance.\n\nWhen an individual doesn’t get any whistles in a 25-point outing, it means they had no choice but to fight through contact and score at a high clip. Pritchard has done just that this season, helping the Celtics navigate life without Tatum.\n\nPritchard is averaging 17.0 points, 5.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game this year, shooting 45.9% from the field and 35.3% from downtown. The Celtics will need Pritchard to remain consistent if they want to return to the NBA Finals.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors predicted to cut ties with Jonathan Kuminga, acquire $108 million two-time blocks leader",
