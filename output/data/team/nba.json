    "fullText": "Tuesday night in the NBA delivered drama, big performances, and tight finishes. Several teams snapped losing streaks, while others struggled to close games. Young stars made noise and veterans stepped up when needed. From last-second free throws to fourth-quarter takeovers, the night had a bit of everything. Here is a breakdown of the winners and losers from all the games.\n\nWashington finally snapped its nine-game losing streak with a tough home win. Alex Sarr led the way with 29 points, 12 rebounds, and six blocks, staying aggressive all night. Kyshawn George and Bub Carrington made big plays late, while Khris Middleton calmly iced the game at the line. Even after getting crushed on the boards, the Wizards found timely buckets and ended a home losing run against Portland that stretched back to 2017.\n\nPortland dominated the glass but couldn’t finish the job. Shaedon Sharpe scored 31 points, and Donovan Clingan added 14 points and 20 rebounds. Deni Avdija had a solid return with 17 points and 12 boards. Missed free throws and another late collapse cost them a winnable game.\n\nNew York owned the fourth quarter by outscoring Sacramento 31-15. Jalen Brunson led the charge with 28 points and took control late. Karl-Anthony Towns added 17 points and 11 rebounds. Mikal Bridges chipped in with 18 points and OG Anunoby had 15. The Knicks forced the pace and turned defense into offense. Mike Brown also earned his first win against Sacramento since leaving the team. Even with 21 turnovers, New York stayed composed when it mattered most.\n\nSacramento lost its sixth straight game and struggled badly from deep. The team shot just 5 of 30 from three-point range. DeMar DeRozan scored 34 points but had little help. Russell Westbrook added 14 points but could not spark a rally. Their offense went cold in the fourth quarter and they could not keep up with New York’s run. Poor shooting and weak defense in the final period sealed their fate.\n\nPhiladelphia bounced back after a blowout loss the night before. Paul George scored 32 points and hit nine three-pointers. Joel Embiid had 29 points and scored 18 in the first quarter alone. Tyrese Maxey added 22 points and kept the offense moving. The Sixers played with fresh energy after both stars returned from rest. Their shooting and ball movement overwhelmed Milwaukee. The win also showed how different this team looks with its main players healthy.\n\nMilwaukee played without Giannis Antetokounmpo and felt his absence. Myles Turner scored 31 points and Ryan Rollins added 24, but defense was the issue. The Bucks allowed too many open looks from three. Bobby Portis and Kyle Kuzma each had 17 points but could not stop the Sixers’ runs. Injuries continued to hurt their rhythm and depth.\n\nOklahoma City avoided a third straight loss despite missing several key players. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 29 points and stayed perfect at the line. Chet Holmgren delivered 20 points, 14 rebounds, and five blocks. Isaiah Joe added 17 points off the bench. The Thunder stayed steady during a late Pelicans push. Strong defense and patience helped them close the game.\n\nNew Orleans could not finish its comeback after cutting the lead to five. Zion Williamson had 21 points and 11 rebounds on efficient shooting. Saddiq Bey added 16 points and 13 rebounds. Tempers flared late and the flow of the game slipped away from them. Missed chances in the final minutes cost them a third-quarter rally.\n\nDetroit continued its strong run and held off a late Denver charge. Tobias Harris scored 22 points and hit two clutch free throws. Cade Cunningham finished with 22 points and 11 assists. The Pistons built an early lead and survived missed shots down the stretch. Their balance and poise showed again in a tight finish.\n\nDenver struggled with travel issues and missing players. Jamal Murray had 24 points and 10 assists but missed key free throws late. Jonas Valanciunas posted 16 points and 16 rebounds in his return. Fatigue and injuries hurt their execution. The rally fell short after several missed chances.\n\nPhoenix won despite missing key scorers. Mark Williams had 27 points and Dillon Brooks added 26. Grayson Allen chipped in with 18 points. The Suns survived a late Nets run and closed the game with defense and free throws. Even after a scuffle broke out, they stayed focused and finished strong.\n\nBrooklyn lost its sixth straight game. Michael Porter Jr. scored a season-high 36 points but got little support. Egor Demin added 15 points. The Nets could not hold a late lead and struggled with second scoring options. Emotions ran high and technical fouls did not help their cause.\n\nThe Clippers erased an early deficit with a huge second and third quarter. Kawhi Leonard led the comeback and stayed steady late. Kris Dunn sparked a big third-quarter surge with defense and playmaking. Los Angeles outscored Utah 36-20 in the third and never looked back. The win moved them closer to a .500 record.\n\nUtah started fast but faded after halftime. Lauri Markkanen led early but struggled later. The Jazz could not handle the Clippers’ pressure defense. Scoring dried up in the second half and the lead slipped away quickly. Another loss showed their trouble finishing games.\n\nJanuary 27 brought strong wins for teams like Washington, New York, and Philadelphia. Young stars like Alex Sarr and Chet Holmgren made a clear impact. Veteran leaders such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George also delivered when needed. On the losing side, missed free throws and cold shooting proved costly for several teams. The night showed how small moments can decide close NBA games.\n\nThe post NBA results: January 27, 2026 – winners and losers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "A sports nutritionist for NBA champs explains why athletes stop drinking water after 4 p.m. to optimize hydration and perform their best.",
    "fullText": "NBA champions don't have time for morning brain fog or an afternoon slump.\n\nTheir secret to staying sharp all day long: perfectly-timed water breaks, according to a top sports nutritionist.\n\nMatt Jones, who worked with the Boston Celtics during their 2024 NBA Championship-winning season and advises the supplement brand Cadence, said the pros have mastered the art of optimal hydration.\n\n\"Fueling intentionally is probably one of the biggest things we can take from the world of professional sport,\" he told Business Insider. \"Professional athletes are very good at repeating basic behaviors like hydrating, and it's those routines that allow them to perform to the best of their ability.\"\n\nIf you want to level up your hydration game, start paying attention to how much you drink and when, Jones recommends.\n\nAfter years of experience coaching elite athletes and military professionals, he has five key tips for getting enough water and electrolytes for better performance throughout the day.\n\nStaying hydrated makes a big difference to your brain and body in the office or on the basketball court, Jones said.\n\n\"It can impact your mood, your decision-making; it can impact the way you just go about your normal life,\" he said.\n\nResearch suggests that mild or moderate dehydration can impair reaction time and memory. Physically, being dehydrated can reduce strength and endurance, and make it more difficult to recover after exercise.\n\nJones uses a gold-standard test to see if his athletes need to drink more water. It can tell you if you're dehydrated based on three symptoms:\n\nEveryone's water needs are different, based on how much energy you use.\n\nJones said the gold standard recommendation is 1 milliliter to 1.5 milliliters per calorie of energy expenditure (in normal conditions). Two liters — or that eight cups of water a day you've probably heard about — makes sense for someone who burns 2,000 calories a day, but you may need more or less depending on your body size and activity level.\n\nSleeping is a superpower for athletes, and a simple tip helps them stay well-hydrated without too many overnight bathroom trips.\n\nJones said the solution for his athletes, including the Celtics, is to drink 80% of their fluids for the day before 4 p.m. so that their bodies have time to process all that liquid before bedtime.\n\nPlain water should be your first priority for hydration, but other drinks and even foods can count toward your daily total.\n\nFor instance, your morning brew can help keep you hydrated, since caffeinated drinks in moderation lead to a net gain in fluid. Just steer clear of artificially sweetened or sugary beverages, too much of which can cause health issues like chronic inflammation over time.\n\nHydrating foods such as fruits and veggies also provide electrolytes to regulate the fluids in your body.\n\nSodium, or salt, is a key electrolyte, but you probably get enough in your diet already. Instead, Jones said to focus on potassium to offset the side effects of too much sodium, such as high blood pressure.\n\nGood sources of potassium include bananas, avocados, coconut water, pomegranate, and watermelon.\n\nDehydration can sneak up on you before you realize it, especially if you're sweating a lot.\n\n\"During intense exercise, particularly in warm environments, thirst is not a good indicator of hydration status,\" Jones said. \"People are often chasing their tails a little bit.\"\n\nYou can calculate your sweat rate to estimate just how much water you need to replace during exercise, like Jones does with the pros.\n\nPrevent a dip in performance by drinking water at regular intervals.\n\n\"The first priority as soon as your big toe hits planet earth in the morning is to rehydrate,\" Jones said.",

    "description": "The NBA released the list of participants for the Castrol Rising Stars for the 2026 All-Star Weekend. A list intended to celebrate the league’s future stars turned into disrespect for Golden State Warriors fans.",
    "fullText": "The NBA released the list of participants for the Castrol Rising Stars for the 2026 All-Star Weekend. A list intended to celebrate the league’s future stars turned into disrespect for Golden State Warriors fans. With multiple teams getting more than one selection on both rookie and sophomore teams, Dub Nation found not even one of theirs on the list.\n\nTwo years ago, Brandin Podziemski was the sole selection for the Warriors. Last year, their representation increased to two players. This year, the Warriors were among the 15 teams without representation on the sophomore and rookie lists. The Dub Nation is one of the proudest fan bases, and giving them no representation invited voices calling out the league. “Not one Warrior smh,” a fan wrote, expressing discontent with the selection.\n\nLet’s not forget, they were the most dominant team of the last decade, and produced stars like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. So, being denied entry into the list would surely warrant outrage from the fanbase. They were particularly upset with their rookie, Will Richard, getting no recognition.\n\nIn the past, several notable names haven’t made the Rising Star selection. Cam Whitmore, Tari Eason and Andrew Nembhard, who are gradually making their mark in the league, all missed the selection in 2024.\n\nIsaiah Collier, one of the best bench players in the league, was one of the missing names last year. These past snubs have also attracted similar outrage from fans on social media.\n\nThe Warriors fans’ discontent extended beyond representation. They boldly called out the league, with a fan demanding respect for one of their rookies. “Respect Will Richard.” The sentiment is certainly not baseless. The No. 56 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft has vastly outperformed expectations. He made his debut with a 13-point performance.\n\nRichard has emerged as a consistent contributor from the bench. Steve Kerr has shown trust in him, and he won over fans in his first game. He plays on both ends, and his defensive mindset has earned him Rookie of the Year praise from fans on social media. “Will Richard snubbed,” a Warriors fan bluntly called out the selection.\n\nHowever, it’s not only Warriors fans who had an issue with the lack of representation. Remember Hugo Gonzalez, Joe Mazzulla’s instinctive weapon? “Hugo Gonzalez snubbed,” a Celtics fan was clearly upset with his name not being selected. Gonzalez became an instant favorite among the Celtics fans after he made the game-tying 3-pointer to send the game against the Brooklyn Nets into double overtime.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors had one selection. Collin Murray-Boyles, the rookie from Gamecocks, had slowly gotten himself into the starter’s role in the absence of Jakob Pöltl. However, a Raptors fan took issue with one player’s absence from the sophomore roster.\n\n“Where is Jamal Shead?” one fan pointed out. Shead has emerged as the primary backup point guard for the Raptors this season. He is only behind Isaiah Collier for the most bench assists this season. Raptors fans’ issue with him being snubbed was perhaps warranted.\n\nAce Bailey was one of the biggest snubs in the selection. He is the only player from the top 9 rookie selections from 2025 who didn’t make the cut. With Utah having no players on either team, some felt he should have made it.\n\nHowever, with just 21 slots available, deserving players missing out is perhaps unavoidable. However, does it seal a player’s fate? Absolutely not.\n\nThe post Dub Nation Demands Respect After Warriors Star Is Snubbed in NBA Rising Stars Announcement appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

The deal makes Rodman the highest-paid player in NWSL history and, per her agent Mike Senkowski, the highest-paid women’s soccer player in the world. The announcement was made at an event in Los Angeles alongside Spirit owner Michele Kang and club executives, while Rodman continues training with the USWNT.\n\nMORE: Athlete cult favorite Jack in the Box announces 75th anniversary streetwear drop\n\n“It feels amazing. I’m very happy, I’m very blessed,” Rodman said after signing. “I think it’s a monumental and game-changing moment right now.” She added that the deal aligns with her long-term vision, calling it “perfect timing with the World Cup happening in the U.S.”\n\nThe agreement closes a chaotic chapter that began when Rodman’s previous contract expired on Dec. 31. Despite being the league’s most recognizable star, she entered the offseason without a deal, fueling speculation that she could leave the National Women's Soccer League entirely. Sources indicated that top clubs abroad — particularly in England — had made lucrative offers that Washington could not match under the league’s salary cap, which stood at $3.5 million per team in 2025.\n\nIn late November, Rodman and the Spirit reportedly reached a creative four-year agreement that would have averaged more than $1 million per season. That proposal was later rejected by the league, with commissioner Jessica Berman ruling that it violated league rules. The NWSL also accused Rodman of attempting to circumvent the cap, prompting the NWSL Players Association to file a grievance on her behalf, calling the intervention a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nAs the standoff intensified, the league’s board of governors approved a new High Impact Player (HIP) rule in December, allowing teams to exceed the salary cap by up to $1 million for certain star players. Spirit president of soccer operations Haley Carter confirmed that Rodman’s new contract benefited from the implementation of that rule.\n\n“Not only me personally but all of us at the Spirit are profoundly grateful that she has chosen to stay with us,” Kang said, referencing the “very compelling alternatives” Rodman had elsewhere.\n\nMORE: Ex-NFL QB Kellen Mond roasts former head coach: 'Leadership is an atmosphere you create'\n\nRodman, drafted second overall by Washington in 2021, helped deliver the club’s first NWSL championship as a rookie and has remained its centerpiece ever since.",

    "fullText": "Spurs announce trio of guards set for NBA Rising Stars challenge originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA announced on Monday evening that San Antonio Spurs sophomore Stephon Castle and rookie Dylan Harper have been selected to compete in the 2026 Castrol Rising Stars Game during NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles.\n\nIt will mark the fifth time in franchise history that the Spurs have had multiple Rising Stars in the same season.\n\nHarper has participated in 35 games and is averaging 10.2 points, 3.5 assists, and 3.3 rebounds in just 21 minutes per game. He is one of only five rookies to achieve these averages and the only rookie to do so without the support of a star player. Harper ranks among the top 10 rookies in assists, standing at No. 5, steals at No. 6, and scoring at No. 10. Earlier this season, he made history by becoming the youngest guard in NBA history to record a game with at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists, and zero turnovers.\n\n21-year-old Stephon Castle is set to make his second appearance in the Rising Stars event after winning last year's Rising Stars MVP and advancing to the All-Star Game in San Francisco. This season, he has started in 36 games, averaging career-best statistics of 16.9 points, 7.1 assists, 5.0 rebounds, and 1.30 steals in 31.0 minutes per game. This season, he became the fastest player in Spurs history to reach 1,500 points and 500 assists, accomplishing it in just 105 games.\n\nTwo-way guard 24-year-old David Jones Garcia is also representing them in Los Angeles. In nine regular-season games with the Austin Spurs, he leads the league in scoring with an impressive average of 26.8 points per game. He also set a career high by scoring 45 points against the Texas Legends.\n\nRISING STAR 🤩\n\nCongrats DJG on being selected to the NBA G League roster for the 2026 Rising Stars game! pic.twitter.com/k9NyIWqFIH\n\n— Austin Spurs (@austin_spurs) January 27, 2026\n\nOn Tuesday, January 27, three teams of NBA Rising Stars will be drafted, and a fourth team will consist of NBA G League players.

    "fullText": "While Minnesota is supercharged with emotions, Stephen Curry demonstrated physical grit of his own. Before he lent heartfelt support to the grieving community that’s rattled by the death of Alex Pretti on Saturday (the day the game was originally scheduled for), Curry led the Warriors to a 111-85 win. All while powering through injuries, getting hurt again, and adding another historic knotch to his resume.\n\nCurry revealed he was following the goings-on in Minnesota while he spent Saturday resting his knee after the game was cancelled. He was listed as questionable before Sunday’s rescheduled game. But he played 28 minutes and was instrumental in the Dubs’ turnaround. Another player stepped on his toe, but that didn’t seem to slow him down.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the Dubs and Wolves have a back-to-back rematch tomorrow. When asked if he would be available tomorrow, Curry said, “If everything goes well, yeah. With the recovery and all that, the minutes tonight weren’t crazy, so hopefully I respond well.”\n\nWhen the Golden State Warriors landed in Minnesota yesterday, some of the players got their workouts in before the game was canceled. The point guard hurt his knee during that. “Kind of something flared up yesterday when we came over to get a workout in. It was super weird,” he revealed.\n\nBut his personal injury update is a lot more concerning when he reveals some persistent issues. “I’ve had stuff going on with quads and whatnot, but it was something that I hadn’t felt before. So, I definitely took advantage of the day off to get right, but hopefully that continues.”\n\nAfter Jimmy Butler’s season-ending ACL tear, followed by Jonathan Kuminga’s indefinite break for bone bruising, the last thing Dub Nation can deal with is an injured Steph. Tomorrow De’Anthony Melton and Al Horford sit out for injury management and fans wouldn’t mind if Steph joined them. Moving up the all-time scoring ladder can wait a little longer.\n\nDespite battling injuries, Stephen Curry had an impressive 26 points, 2 rebounds, 7 assists, and 4 steals. That alone carried him to the 19th spot on the NBA’s All-time Scoring list. He passed John Havlicek and tied Paul Pierce for cracking the top 20 with 26,397 points in his career.\n\nHe’s only 99 points away from catching up to Tim Duncan next. So far this season, Curry has averaged 27.3 points, 5.0 assists, and 3.7 rebounds while shooting 46.8% from the field and 39.8% from the arc.\n\nAnalysts predict he’d crack top 10 soon enough. They, in fact, think he would’ve done it a long time ago had it not been for his injury history that also kept him underpaid for a period of time.\n\nTonight, Curry limped during the empty moments and yet he carried the offense. If he aggravates what is now a sore knee and ends up missing more than one game, the Warriors’ offense will be diminished.\n\nFor now even Steve Kerr is hopeful that Curry will be cleared to play. Steph is still listed as questionable for Monday and they’ve left his status as a game-time decision.\n\nThe post Stephen Curry Shares Worrying Injury Update After Historic NBA Achievement Against Timberwolves appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe world of college basketball is changing. Through loopholes, players who have gone on to play professional basketball — though not in the NBA — have found ways to return to college and tap into unused eligibility.\n\nOne such player is Alabama’s Charles Bediako. If you recognize the name, it may be because the 7-foot center spent two seasons with the Crimson Tide from 2021 to 2023. After the conclusion of the 2022–23 season, he declared for the NBA Draft.\n\nBediako wasn't selected but has played in three seasons of the G League, with three different teams. He has now cited that he made a career mistake by leaving college, especially given how the NIL landscape has shifted. Bediako pointed toward international players who never made the NBA, being able to use their unused eligibility after playing overseas, and a temporary injunction was submitted, giving him permission to suit up once again for the Crimson Tide on Saturday, January 24.\n\nHere is more on the controversial Bediako, and his return to Alabama after leaving the Crimson Tide for the G League.\n\nSN's NCAAB HQ: Scores | Schedule | Standings | Latest Polls\n\nBediako is a 7-ft. center. He is a solid player, but his college stats from his first stint at Alabama suggest that he is fine, not great. From 2021 to 2023 he averaged 6.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 19.3 minutes per game in 70 games. The Crimson Tide may use him more now if he has developed from his time in the G League, but it isn't like Alabama is getting back a former No. 1 overall pick.\n\nCharles Bediako takes the floor for warmups to a warm welcome from the student section pic.twitter.com/zhrE1DI3ZH\n\n— Katie Windham (@katiewindham_) January 24, 2026\n\nBediako played 46 games in the G League between 2023 and 2025. In that span, he averaged 21.3 minutes per game with 8.4 points and 8.0 rebounds. Bediako played better in the G League than he did at Alabama during his first stint, but it remains to be seen how his game will translate back to college.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game G League stats.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game college stats from his first stint with the Crimson Tide.\n\nNo. Bediako was not drafted. He opted to leave Alabama after the 2022-2023 season, but he went undrafted. Bediako signed with the San Antonio Spurs' G League team.\n\nMORE: Why is Bediako allowed to return to college basketball?\n\nIn the 2021 class, 247Sports had Bediako ranked as the No. 35 player in the nation. He was considered the sixth-best center as well as the seventh-best player from Florida.\n\nAmong centers, he was ranked behind Chet Holmgren, Jalen Duren, Efton Reid, Nate Bittle and Enoch Boakye. In Florida, he was ranked behind Duren, Caleb Houstan, Moussa Diabate, Reid, Bittle, Tamar Bates and Benny Williams.\n\nBediako was born in Ontario, Canada, on March 10, 2002. As college — and potentially professional — basketball became an option, he began to move around.\n\nHe started his high school career at Ridley College in Ontario before transferring to Andrews Osborne Academy in Willoughby, Ohio. Bediako later transferred again, spending the remainder of his high school career at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nBediako was born on March 10, 2002.

    "fullText": "The 2023-24 UNC basketball team is one of the program's best teams to never win a championship. Complete with an experienced, talented roster that showcased immense chemistry, how the season ended was a disappointment.\n\nYou might recognize a few names on this roster: RJ Davis, Armando Bacot and Harrison Ingram. All three dabbled with the NBA. Davis and Ingram are currently in the G League, while Bacot is playing overseas.\n\nThe best pure shooter on that 2023-24 North Carolina roster, though, is Cormac Ryan. Transferring in from Notre Dame during the prior offseason, Ryan finished his lone season in Carolina Blue second in 3-point percentage (.354) and free throw percentage (.874).\n\nNow a member of the G-League's Wisconsin Herd, who are affiliated with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, Ryan is thriving in his second pro season.\n\nRyan is averaging 21.4 points per game on 50% field goal shooting, a 42% mark from deep and 90% mark from the free throw line.\n\nThe Herd are just 6-8 as of Saturday morning, but they have a true leader in Ryan. Question is: when will Milwaukee call Ryan up to make his NBA regular season debut?\n\nIt's no secret the 2025-26 Tar Heels could use Ryan's shooting prowess on their roster, particularly from the free throw line. UNC has its best frontcourt in years, led by Caleb Wilson and Henri Veesaar, but backcourt production is still coming into its own.\n\nThat 2023-24 North Carolina squad lost to Alabama in a heartbreaking, Sweet 16 result.

    "fullText": "Saturday’s NBA table is packed with games that can swing the standings in both conferences. Some teams are trying to stop losing streaks, while others want to protect their home floors. From an early afternoon clash in Philadelphia to a late-night tip in Utah, every matchup brings its own pressure and story. Here is a clear look at the games and the teams most likely to come out on top. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Spectrum Center, Charlotte\n\nWashington enters on a rough stretch. The Wizards are 1-9 in their last 10 games and are allowing over 120 points per game in that span. Injuries have hit them hard, with Marvin Bagley III, Bilal Coulibaly, and Trae Young all sidelined. Scoring has become a problem without steady shooting and rebounding depth.\n\nCharlotte is more stable at home and already beat Washington 126-109 in their last meeting. LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller continue to drive the offense, while Kon Knueppel is shooting over 48 percent from the field. The Hornets also defend better than Washington and force tougher shots. The double-digit spread reflects the gap in form and health. Charlotte should control this game from the second quarter onward.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nPhiladelphia comes off an overtime win against Houston, but their recent run is mixed at 5-5 in the last 10 games. Tyrese Maxey remains the main scoring threat, and Joel Embiid has been steady but not dominant in recent outings.\n\nNew York has struggled against teams above .500, yet their shooting profile gives them an edge here. The Knicks average nearly 15 made three-pointers per game, which is more than Philadelphia usually allows. Karl-Anthony Towns leads them with over 20 points and 11 rebounds per game. The narrow spread shows how close this matchup is. Shot-making from deep and rebounding could tilt it toward New York late.\n\nPredicted winner: New York Knicks\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Target Center, Minneapolis\n\nMinnesota has lost four straight games and has shown defensive leaks during that run. They still score well, averaging 120 points per game on the season, but stopping elite shooters remains a concern.\n\nGolden State enters in better rhythm, winning six of its last ten. Stephen Curry continues to hit close to four threes per game, and the Warriors average over 122 points recently. The Timberwolves won the last meeting, but Curry scored 39 in that game. The plus points suggest a close contest. Experience and perimeter shooting give Golden State a real chance to steal this one on the road.\n\nPredicted winner: Golden State Warriors\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nCleveland just beat Charlotte while holding them under 90 points. Donovan Mitchell led the way with 24 points, and the Cavs grabbed 60 rebounds in that game. Their defense forces turnovers and limits clean looks from three.\n\nOrlando is coming off a heavy loss to Charlotte, allowing over 54 percent shooting. Paolo Banchero scored 23, but the Magic were outworked on both ends. Cleveland ranks sixth in scoring at over 119 points per game and also forces nearly 16 turnovers per night. With better form and more reliable shooting, Cleveland looks ready to edge Orlando even as a slight underdog.\n\nPredicted winner: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nBoston is strong on defense and sits second in the league in points allowed. Jaylen Brown just scored 30 against Indiana, while the team shot over 92 percent from the free-throw line. Their balance between scoring and defense keeps them steady on the road.\n\nChicago plays fast and ranks high in assists, but their defense gives up nearly 120 points per game. Coby White leads the offense, yet the Bulls allow too many open looks from outside. Boston’s ability to control pace and rebound should matter here. The small spread favors the more disciplined team. Boston should pull away late in the fourth.\n\nPredicted winner: Boston Celtics\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center, Dallas\n\nDallas has won three straight at home and has gone 7-3 in its last ten games. Cooper Flagg leads the team in scoring and rebounds, while Naji Marshall has added steady points in recent games. The Mavericks shoot well and protect home court better than their overall record suggests.\n\nLos Angeles relies heavily on Luka Doncic, who is averaging over 33 points per game. The Lakers, however, are 4-6 in their last ten and have struggled with consistency. Dallas lost the first meeting, but this setting favors the home side. The points advantage and recent form make Dallas a solid pick.\n\nPredicted winner: Dallas Mavericks\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Delta Center, Salt Lake City\n\nUtah has been leaky on defense but still scores well, averaging over 117 points per game in the last ten. Keyonte George leads the attack with more than 24 points per game. Home games have been more competitive for the Jazz.\n\nMiami struggles on the road with an 8-15 away record. Their shooting has dipped below 44 percent in recent games, and they allow over 121 points per contest in the last ten. Utah’s pace and scoring should test Miami’s defense. The plus points suggest value on the home team. Utah has the edge in this matchup.\n\nJanuary 24 have some good games overall. Charlotte, Boston, and Cleveland look well positioned, while underdogs like Golden State, Dallas, and Utah have strong upset potential based on form and matchup stats. Fans should expect high-scoring games in Minnesota and Utah, with tighter contests in Philadelphia and Orlando.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 24: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Over his 23 years in the NBA, LeBron James has had many rivals who have tried to get under his skin. However, arguably, none of them have been as successful in recent history as Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks, a hard-nosed defensive specialist with erratic habits, someone who has consistently gotten a reaction out of the King. Now, Brooks has publicly addressed his tactics.\n\n“If this was LeBron, maybe five years ago, then it’d be different,” Brooks said about James to Twitch streamer Agent during a recent appearance on his livestream. “Miami Bron, you’re not really talking shit to him for real, cause then it’s like, blow by, dunk. He’s got more game to him, more agile. Right now, he’s like, like I’ve always been saying, he’s old.”\n\nFor Brooks, it’s clear that trash talk is just one more tactic that he uses as a part of his defensive identity, and a situational way to disrupt rhythm and force opposing stars into emotionally engage with him. Whether that approach is criticized or lauded has never seemed much to matter to him.\n\nWith the Phoenix Suns, even as he experiences as increased offensive role which averaging career-highs across the board, Brooks’ defensive edge hasn’t softened. He presented his mindset as preparation, something he’s seen doing frequently before games, and a belief that every aspect of his opponent’s temperament and limitations factor into being able to stop them on defense.\n\n“You can press up on him,” Brooks continued on James. “You can cut him off spots so you know his moves he’s going to do. So you can always chirp a little bit. For some reason, he likes to do a little chirping… I got like quick twitch back.”\n\nWhen the Phoenix Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers met earlier this season, the tension between LeBron James and Dillon brooks was evident throughout the game. Brooks drew the James assignment for most of the game, playing extremely physically, crowding his space and talking throughout the night as the matchup felt almost playoff-like in it’s edge.\n\nOne key possession highlighted the double-edged approach of Brooks’ tactics. With just over 12 seconds left in the game, the Suns forward drilled a go-ahead three right in James’ face, seemingly validating his approach.\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards, James seemingly rolled over Brooks, resulting in a no-call, causing the two to get briefly entangled. Brooks was quickly assessed his second technical following this exchange and was ejected, a sequence that eventually snowballed into handing the Lakers a win from the late advantage.\n\nLooking back, this game clearly reads as a real-time example of everything Brooks talked about on stream with Agent. He pressed up on James, cut off his preferred spots, leaned into constant chatter, and while James ultimately sealed the win late, the exchange highlighted why every matchup between the two is primetime.\n\nBrooks isn’t just challenging perhaps the greatest player in league history, but actively pushing the margins of engaging against superstars.\n\nThe post Dillon Brooks Takes Aim at Aging LeBron James While Explaining Trash Talk Tactics appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "On the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback with Ian Begley, SNY's NBA Insider and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype discuss Karl-Anthony Towns trade rumors and potential deadline deals.",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NBA trade deadline arriving on Feb. 5, there are plenty of questions surrounding the Knicks and their NBA Finals expectations.\n\nNew York snapped their four-game losing streak in an impressive win over the Nets on Wednesday night, but the team is still in the midst of one of its worst stretches in the Jalen Brunson era. With the win, they are 3-9 over their last 12 games and have fallen into the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference -- they would be the four-seed if they didn't hold the tiebreaker over the Raptors.\n\nSo, as the Knicks look to improve the roster, what should fans be looking for? SNY NBA Insider Ian Begley spoke on the topic on the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback, where he and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype broke down what they are hearing as the trade deadline gets closer.\n\nAfter the Knicks' dreadful loss to the undermanned Mavericks at home on Monday, Newsday's Steve Popper reported that New York had spoken to a number of teams (Hornets, Grizzlies, Magic) about a potential trade involving Towns.\n\nTowns' numbers are down pretty much across the board and the big man even admitted that he's had a tough time adjusting to head coach Mike Brown's system.\n\nBegley shared on The Putback what he had heard.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations about trading Karl-Anthony Towns,\" Begley said. \"As of Monday, it was not happening. As far as something in the aftermath of that Dallas loss, no, that wasn’t the case.\"\n\nBegley added that if the Knicks go through another 2-9 stretch and continue to struggle as they get closer to the trade deadline, things might change.\n\nWhenever Towns' name is thrown out there as a trade candidate, the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is not far behind. It seems like an easy swap for both teams, but Scotto threw some cold water on the idea.\n\n“I personally never gotten the sense, at least from talking to my sources, that a team like the Milwaukee Bucks would be overly aggressive in trying to get Karl Towns in a Giannis Antetokounmpo package, theoretically,\" Scotto said.\n\nScotto suggested that the Knicks, if they were to deal Towns, would have to consider \"breaking up\" Towns' salary into multiple pieces, similar to what the Timberwolves did when they moved the big man to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations on trading Karl-Anthony Towns\"\n\nOn The Putback with @IanBegley, Ian discusses what he's heard on the KAT reports and his read on if the Knicks would make that trade pic.twitter.com/bvLAdFjzt2\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 22, 2026\n\nSince a Towns trade is unlikely, what players should we be on the lookout for?\n\nGuerschon Yabusele is as likely a candidate to be moved. According to Scotto, the acquisition was seen as a \"homerun\" by execs in the offseason, but it was made before the hiring of Brown. Clearly, Yabusele has had a tough time integrating into Brown's system, and the Knicks are looking to shop him. Scotto even suggested the Knicks may have to pair Yabusele with another minimum-salary player or draft picks to get a player that could help the team.\n\nScotto shared that the Pelicans have two players that the Knicks checked in.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were calling not only on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans but also Yves Missi,\" Scotto said. \"Part of it could be doing background, doing due diligence, but you don't make calls on these guys unless you're intersted so that raised my antenna a little bit. If you take Yabusele and another minimum guy, you could maybe try to make something happen there.\"\n\nThe Knicks' interest in Alvarado is well-documented by Missi is a name that even Begley was surprised by.\n\nMissi, 21, is a second-year center who has seen his minutes deep in year two. In his rookie campaign, Missi played around 27 minutes a game (73 games), averaging nine points, and eight rebounds (3.5 offensive). In his sophomore year, Missi is averaging 19 minutes and just 5.5 points and 5.5 rebounds (2.9 offensive) across 38 games.\n\nAcquiring another big like Missi could open up more avenues for deals involving the Knicks. Would they deal Mitchell Robinson, who is on the final year of his contract, or one of the depth bigs like Ariel Hukporti? That also opens up the possibility to trade Towns as well.\n\nThe Knicks have a lot to consider as they hope to fortify their roster for the final stretch of the regular season and the playoffs.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were not only calling on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans, but also Yves Missi\"\n\nOn today's episode of The Putback, @MikeAScotto - a must-follow for NBA fans - discusses trade deadline (link to full show in post below) pic.twitter.com/11wdozjICd\n\n— Ian Begley (@IanBegley) January 22, 2026",

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA player says dating Khloe Kardashian 'derailed' his career originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer NBA guard Rashad McCants says his brief relationship with Khloe Kardashian came at a cost he believes went far beyond tabloid attention. In his view, the timing and culture of the league during his playing days turned off-court visibility into a professional liability.\n\nMcCants, who was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2005, has said that players in his era were expected to keep a low profile unless they were established superstars. Any perceived distraction, he argues, could quickly be held against someone still trying to secure a foothold in the league.\n\nMORE: Miami fans think adult film star Abella Danger is dating Carson Beck because of a viral fake tweet\n\nSpeaking with Basketball Network’s Nick Raguz, McCants explained how celebrity relationships were viewed differently before the rise of social media and player branding. “Before, it was a distraction,” he said. “The powers didn’t want players doing anything outside of the NBA that would be considered a distraction. You didn’t see a lot of guys dating celebrities unless they were high-profile players.”\n\nAccording to McCants, that distinction mattered. Playing in a small market while dating someone already famous brought scrutiny he felt he couldn’t afford. “For me, not being a high-profile guy and being in Minnesota, it was more of a distraction than a compliment,” he said. “I was one of the early bloomers for all of those things, and it didn’t help my situation.”\n\nOn the court, McCants’ NBA run was short and uneven. Injuries and inconsistent minutes limited his opportunities, and he averaged 9.9 points per game across four seasons with the Timberwolves. As teams turned over rosters and leaned toward younger players, his role diminished, and his NBA career ended after the 2008-09 season.\n\nMORE: Klay Thompson shows up to support Megan Thee Stallion's latest Dunkin promo\n\nThe former guard also pointed to how much the league has changed since then. Today’s NBA encourages players to build brands, embrace social media, and expand their visibility, regardless of market size. In McCants’ telling, that shift highlights how different the environment was when he was trying to establish himself.",

    "description": "Get the best Lakers vs. Clippers predictions ahead of tonight's battle of L.A. at the Intuit Dome. Free NBA picks for January 22.",
    "fullText": "As we hit the halfway point in the NBA schedule, the Los Angeles Clippers finally seem to be salvaging their season, but that progress will be tested tonight when they host the Los Angeles Lakers at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe Battle of L.A. season series sits at 1-1 heading into this matchup, and my Lakers vs. Clippers predictions expect LeBron James to be one of the swing factors.\n\nLet's dive right into my NBA picks for Thursday, January 22.\n\nLakers vs Clippers best bet: LeBron James Over 12.5 rebounds + assists (-112 bet365)\n\nLeBron James' injury issues may point to a 41-year-old in his 23rd season, but his stat lines suggest he’s got something left in the tank. James has been able to keep his sciatica and arthritis at bay while starting 2026 with a bang, so look for his fingerprints to be all over tonight’s clash with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nWith Luka Doncic doing so much of the scoring for the Los Angeles Lakers, I’m targeting LeBron’s rebounds and assists here, and he’s gone past this combo O/U number in four of his past five outings.\n\nJames has been getting the job done in both these categories so far this month, with averages of 7.7 RPG and 7.6 APG in January, and he was closing in on a triple-double in L.A.’s win over the Denver Nuggets earlier this week.\n\nUntil Austin Reaves returns, LeBron is going to have a larger share of the playmaking, particularly when Luka is on the bench, and there’s just not a lot of secondary ball-handling in the current rotation. Equally, he’s got a big role to play alongside Deandre Ayton on the boards.\n\nAt this stage of his career, James can still do the little things that drive winning, and the Lakers will need all of that veteran savvy to hold off their cross-city rivals tonight.\n\nThe Lakers are 7-3 SU in their last 10 meetings with the Clippers, and an impressive 14-8 on the road this season. With Kawhi Leonard still listed as questionable, the burden on James Harden could once again be massive, and the hosts gave up 138 points to the Chicago Bulls this week.\n\nHarden continues to put up big numbers, and I’ll take the Over on his rebounds prop here. He’s grabbed 4+ boards in six of his last seven games, and the Clippers will gladly keep him closer to the rim if it avoids the Luka defensive assignment.\n\nIvica Zubac has had some miserable possessions trying to guard Doncic on switches in the past, but the Clippers will lean on him for big minutes here. Zubac has posted three straight double-doubles, and he’s finished with 11+ rebounds in his last four games.\n\nSpread: Lakers -1.5 (+100) | Clippers +1.5 (-120)\n\nMoneyline: Lakers -110 | Clippers -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 223.5 (-110) | Under 223.5 (-110)\n\nThe Lakers are 5-2 ATS in the last seven meetings between these teams.

    "fullText": "Thursday night brings one of the busiest NBA slates of the week. January 22 features playoff contenders, rising young teams, and a few matchups that could swing late with one hot quarter. Home court, recent form, and injury updates all play a role in shaping how these games may unfold. So, let’s have a look around each game of the night. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nOrlando enters this game with a strong home record. The Magic are 14-7 at home and sit near the top of the Southeast Division. Free throw scoring is their biggest strength. They lead the league with 22 made free throws per game, which often keeps them ahead late.\n\nCharlotte has struggled with consistency. The Hornets are 16-28 and have dropped multiple road games this season. Three-point shooting remains their main weapon, ranking third in makes per game. Defensive issues continue to hurt them, especially allowing high shooting percentages.\n\nOrlando’s defense limits perimeter shots well, allowing under 12 threes per game. That directly challenges Charlotte’s main scoring path. The Magic also hold an edge in recent form despite a rough loss to Memphis.\n\nPredicted winner: Orlando Magic\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nHouston has quietly been one of the better road rebounding teams. They lead the West in offensive rebounds, which helps offset shooting slumps. Even with key injuries, the Rockets control the glass well.\n\nPhiladelphia remains dangerous at home but has been inconsistent. Tyrese Maxey continues to carry the scoring load, averaging 30 points. Joel Embiid is listed day to day, which impacts interior defense and scoring balance.\n\nThe Rockets shoot nearly 48 percent from the field, which is slightly above what Philadelphia usually allows. Houston also comes into this game on a three-game winning streak, while the Sixers are hovering around .500 at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nWashington has one of the weakest defenses in the league. They allow over 123 points per game and struggle to contain efficient offenses. Home games have not helped much, as they remain below .500 in Washington.\n\nDenver has been excellent on the road. The Nuggets are 17-7 away from home and average over 121 points per game. Even with Nikola Jokic sidelined, Jamal Murray has stepped up in recent games.\n\nThe Nuggets already beat the Wizards earlier this month. That win came by six points and featured strong perimeter shooting. Washington has also dropped eight of its last ten games, which points to ongoing problems.\n\nPredicted winner: Denver Nuggets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center\n\nGolden State is on a four-game winning streak and scoring at a high level. Over the last ten games, the Warriors average more than 123 points per night. Ball movement and three-point volume remain elite.\n\nDallas has talent but remains injury-hit. Several key rotation players are out, including Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis. Cooper Flagg has played well, yet the Mavericks struggle defensively against strong shooting teams.\n\nGolden State already beat Dallas earlier this season by double digits. The Warriors also rank near the top in made threes per game, while Dallas allows one of the highest three-point totals in the West.\n\nPredicted winner: Golden State Warriors\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nMinnesota has been dominant at home with a 15-6 record. The Timberwolves score heavily in the paint and have multiple scoring options. Anthony Edwards continues to average close to 30 points per game.\n\nChicago scores well but struggles defensively on the road. The Bulls allow 120 points per game, which becomes a problem against high-tempo teams. Minnesota already beat Chicago by 35 points earlier this season.\n\nThe Timberwolves are also trying to stop a three-game losing streak. That adds urgency to their performance at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nSan Antonio has been one of the most balanced teams in the West. They move the ball well and rank high in assists per game. Victor Wembanyama continues to anchor both ends of the floor.\n\nUtah allows the most points in the league. Defensive issues remain a constant problem. Even after a strong scoring night from Keyonte George, the Jazz still struggle to close games.\n\nThe Spurs already beat Utah earlier this week by double digits. San Antonio also holds a clear edge in efficiency and defensive rating.\n\nPredicted winner: San Antonio Spurs\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nThis matchup remains tight every season. The Clippers won the last meeting by 15 points. Home court has helped them recently, winning three straight in Inglewood.\n\nThe Lakers rely heavily on Luka Doncic and LeBron James. They perform well in close games, staying undefeated in contests decided by fewer than four points. Injuries remain a concern, especially in the backcourt.\n\nThe Clippers score less overall but defend better at home. That balance explains the narrow line.\n\nPredicted winner: Los Angeles Clippers\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nPortland has won eight of its last ten games and plays well at home. Rebounding has been a major strength, led by Donovan Clingan. The Trail Blazers also limit opponent scoring better than earlier in the season.\n\nMiami struggles on the road with an 8-14 record. Shooting efficiency has dipped over the last ten games. Tyler Herro remains out, which reduces scoring punch.\n\nPortland already lost a close game to Miami earlier this season. Recent form suggests a different outcome this time.\n\nPredicted winner: Portland Trail Blazers\n\nJanuary 22 is packed with games that could quietly shift the standings. Some favorites look steady, while a few underdogs have enough momentum to keep things close. Home floors matter tonight, especially in Minnesota, Denver, and Orlando. Late games in Los Angeles and Portland may come down to execution in the final minutes. It is a slate where smart matchups matter more than big names.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 22: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Bombshell report involving Bronny, LeBron James reveals new details about Lakers' 2024 NBA Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2024 NBA Draft was highly anticipated for one reason in particular.\n\nWith the Los Angeles Lakers having two picks (No. 17 and No. 55) and LeBron James’ son, Bronny, declaring for the draft after a lackluster freshman campaign at USC, many believed the Lakers would pair their superstar forward with his eldest son.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Lakers did just that, selecting James with their lone second-round pick. On Wednesday, though, a bombshell report involving the James clan reveals new details about the 2024 Draft that’ll surprise fans.\n\n“And when the Lakers drafted James' son Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie (Buss) privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn't,” ESPN’s Baxter Holmes reported Wednesday.\n\nEssentially, if one were to read between the lines, one would conclude that although Buss and the Lakers didn’t genuinely believe Bronny was worth a draft pick, they selected him to appease their aging superstar.\n\nFollowing the highly scrutinized move, Buss felt that James didn’t appreciate the Lakers’ commitment to going out of their way to make him happy, even if their decision wasn’t in the franchise’s best interest.\n\nFast forward to early 2026, and Bronny has been demoted to the G-League several times and doesn’t appear to have a bright future in Los Angeles. It’s reasonable to assume Buss’s frustration with James hasn’t only gotten worse since the 2024 Draft.\n\nMore NBA: Proposed Warriors trade sees Golden State make NBA-altering deal for $101 million Lakers star",

    "fullText": "Walt Frazier delivered a funny moment during the Dallas Mavericks’ 114-97 win over the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Monday.\n\nThe Knicks legend was on commentary with Mike Breen as they discussed Klay Thompson’s impressive career accomplishments.\n\nBreen listed the four championships, five All-Star selections, and his place among the NBA’s greatest shooters, but Frazier decided to add a cheeky twist that caught everyone off guard.\n\nIt was a lighthearted line that drew laughter on the broadcast, but some fans suggested that Thompson might not have appreciated Frazier’s comment.\n\nAs Breen praised Thompson’s achievements, Frazier interrupted with a comment that quickly spread on social media.\n\n“His real claim to fame is Megan Thee Stallion,” Frazier joked about Thompson’s girlfriend on MSG Network.\n\nThe remark, delivered with Frazier’s trademark wit, prompted laughter from Breen and became one of the night’s biggest talking points online.\n\nSome fans praised the 80-year-old broadcaster’s humour, while others suggested the comment might frustrate Thompson, who has spent years building one of the most respected careers in basketball.\n\nThe exchange was clearly lighthearted, but for a player who prides himself on his professionalism and legacy, it might not have been the compliment he was hoping for.\n\nThompson is averaging 12 points in 22 minutes per game this season, shooting 39% from the field and 38% from three-point range.\n\nThose are respectable numbers, but far below the peak standards that made him a four-time NBA champion with Golden State.\n\nHis minutes have been managed carefully as Dallas battles through a tough year marked by injuries to Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving.\n\nAt 18–26 and sitting 12th in the Western Conference, the Mavericks are unlikely to make a serious playoff push this season.\n\nThompson’s experience and leadership remain invaluable, but it’s been a frustrating campaign both for him and the franchise.",

The jam electrified the Sixers' bench and the 18,005 spectators on hand at Xfinity Mobile Arena.\n\nKnown as a high-flyer, Edgecombe has had quite a highlight reel through his first 37 career games with the Sixers, from soaring chasedown blocks to acrobatic finishes.

He is also one of three rookies to score at least 20 points in four straight games this season.\n\nThough Edgecombe doesn't appear to be a likely contestant in the Slam Dunk Contest, the former Baylor guard is considered a lock for the Rising Stars Game on Feb. 13 as one of the top rookies.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rookie Wire: Sixers news: VJ Edgecombe dismisses Slam Dunk Contest question",

The top two teams will then face each other in a championship game.\n\nPlayers selected from Eastern Conference:\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo - Milwaukee Bucks\n\nJalen Brunson - New York Knicks\n\nCade Cunningham - Detroit Pistons\n\nTyrese Maxey - Philadelphia 76ers\n\nPlayers selected from Western Conference:\n\nStephen Curry - Golden State Warriors\n\nLuka Doncic - Los Angeles Lakers\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander - Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nVictor Wembanyama - San Antonio Spurs\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhat changes are being made to 2026 NBA All-Star game?\n\nWhat is the NBA's controversial '65-game rule' and how is it impacting players?\n\nWhat is an ACL injury and why is it so serious?",

    "description": "During NBC's quadruple-header of Martin Luther King Day games, the All-Star Game starters also will be announced.",
    "fullText": "Fans from around the globe cast their ballots, picking who should start in the NBA All-Star Game next month in Los Angeles. Those fan votes (50% of the total) — combined with votes from NBA players (25%) and select media (25%) — have chosen the 10 All-Star Game starters. There are five starters from the Eastern Conference and five from the West (even though those players will later be divided into two USA and one World team for the new format, more on that below).\n\nThose All-Star Game starters will be unveiled today on NBC, read by the NBA Showtime crew live on set at 2 p.m. Eastern. This will be right before the tip-off of the Oklahoma City at Cleveland game, part of a quadruple header of Martin Luther King Day games on NBC and Peacock.\n\nRefresh this page, where we will have all the details on who the starters will be, as well as analysis of those selections.\n\nNow that the fans have had their say, it falls to the coaches around the league.\n\nNBA coaches will vote to choose the seven reserve (or bench) players from each conference. The results of the vote and the names of the remaining NBA All-Stars will be announced next week on NBC.\n\nThose starters and reserves will then be divided up into three teams as part of a new USA vs. World All-Star Game format. Two international players, Luka Doncic in the West and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the East, were the top vote-getters among fans.\n\nWhile the idea of a USA vs. international players All-Star Game format has been talked about for years, 2026 felt like the right time.\n\nThat's because the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players will be divided into three teams — two USA teams and one world team — that will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games. Each of the three teams will have a minimum of eight players (if the USA or World teams are short on players, the league office will select one or more players to reach the required number).\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title.\n\nAll-Star weekend tips off on Feb. 13 with the Rising Stars at the Intuit Dome at 6 p.m. PT, featuring the league's top first- and second-year players. Also on the 13th is the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, featuring stars from media, sports and entertainment at the Kia Forum. The Forum also hosts the fifth annual NBA HBCU Classic at 8 p.m. that night.\n\nOn Saturday, Feb. 14, All-Star Saturday night — featuring the Skills Challenge, 3-point Contest and the Dunk Contest — will take place at the Intuit Dome.\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 5 p.m. Eastern, earlier than in previous years, leading into more coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nPeacock NBA Monday will stream up to three Monday night games each week throughout the regular season. Coast 2 Coast Tuesday presents doubleheaders on Tuesday nights throughout the regular season on NBC and Peacock. On most Tuesdays, an 8 p.m. ET game will be on NBC stations in the Eastern and Central time zones, and an 8 p.m. PT game on NBC stations in the Pacific and often Mountain time zones. Check local listings each week. Both games will stream live nationwide on Peacock. NBC Sports will launch Sunday Night Basketball across NBC and Peacock on Feb. 1, 2026.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA is trying its hand at a brand new All-Star Game format in 2026, but the honor of being named a starter remains unchanged. As in years' past, five players from each conference receive the starter label, even though 15 players will actually start as part of the league's three-team format.\n\nIf the early voting returns were any indication, fans expect the World team to have an advantage over the two USA teams on All-Star Weekend. Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokic were the top three vote-getters in the NBA's final update on Jan. 7, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Victor Wembanyama also not far behind.\n\nFor the Americans, Jalen Brunson put together a strong showing in early voting returns, while Stephen Curry was near the top of the balloting in the West even as he approaches his 38th birthday.\n\nWhich 10 players are 2026 NBA All-Star Game starters? The Sporting News is tracking the full results below.\n\nMORE: Highest-scoring NBA All-Star Games in history\n\nThis section will be updated when the results are revealed.\n\nFans voted on starters for the 2026 NBA All-Star Game from Dec. 17 to Jan. 14, with votes counting for three times the value of a normal vote on five particular days. The All-Star ballot included two guards and three frontcourt players from each conference.\n\nThe selection process remained the same as previous years, with fan vote accounting for 50 percent, media vote accounting for 25 percent and player votes accounting for the final 25 percent toward determining the five starters in each conference.\n\nThe NBA All-Star Game once again has a new format, and it means the honor of being named one of the 10 starters is mostly ceremonial.\n\nThe NBA is breaking in a new USA vs. World format comprised of three teams: two eight-man rosters of American players and one eight-man roster of international players. The teams will play a round-robin format to determine who will advance to the championship game. All games will be played on Sunday, Feb. 15.\n\nIf all three teams are tied after the round-robin format, point differential will be used to determine which teams go to the championship game. Each game will be 12 minutes, adding up to the equivalent of a 48-minute game of basketball.\n\nLocation: Intuit Dome, Inglewood, CA\n\nThe 2026 NBA All-Star will tip off at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 15 from the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. The game has an earlier start time this year to fit around NBC's Winter Olympics coverage.\n\nNBA All-Star Celebrity Game, 7 p.m. ET\n\nNBA Rising Stars Game, 9 p.m. ET\n\nNBA HBCU Classic (Hampton vs. NC A&T), 11 p.m. ET\n\nNBA All-Star Saturday Night, 5 p.m. ET",

    "fullText": "NBA commissioner Adam Silver says he wants to \"tap into\" Europe's football culture as part of the plans for a proposed European basketball league.\n\nSilver says he has spoken to Manchester City and Manchester United, though BBC Sport understands neither intends to have a team should the venture come to fruition.\n\nWith a current working title of NBA Europe, the plan is to launch a permanent league across the continent that could start as soon as the 2027-28 season.\n\nAs many as 16 teams across the continent could be involved, with a team from both London and Manchester expected to feature.\n\nThe league is expected to be made up of new franchises, current basketball teams and football clubs who do and do not currently have associated basketball teams.\n\n\"We're having conversations with everyone, and it's part of why this process has gone on so long,\" Silver told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I began speaking publicly around the Paris Olympics, and we wanted to make sure we've covered everybody. We've talked to all interested parties, we're covering all areas and all opportunities.\"\n\nSilver also confirmed that he has spoken to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain as he looks to mix established European teams with new ones.\n\nHowever, reports say the existing EuroLeague - which features Real and Barcelona - has concerns about the new venture, threatening legal action against the NBA should clubs break existing agreements to take part in the new competition.\n\nBut Silver, speaking before the NBA's first regular season match in London since 2019 on Sunday, feels the already existing strong support of football clubs could play a major role in growing the game across Europe.\n\n\"I want to be careful [of] those traditions,\" he said.\n\n\"That culture is so special, so unique, so long held, I don't want to fool myself or anybody else potentially involved in this new league that they can be easily transferred.\n\n\"At the same time, we want the benefits of that incredible wisdom and knowledge obtained over decades of operation.\n\n\"As an American, I see that religious fervour around people's football clubs here, and we could only be so lucky to tap into that. It's more singularly focused here. To me, that represents opportunity.\n\n\"We don't come into the market thinking we're going to take from football. What we see is a large opportunity and entertainment ecosystem, and we're seeing that all over the world that people are turning to premium live sports.\"",

    "description": "When he was at Wheeler High School in Georgia, Jaylen Brown was considered one of the top players in the country. The school retired his jersey.",
    "fullText": "A decade before he became an NBA All‑Star and Finals MVP, Jaylen Brown sat in a Wheeler High School classroom and heard a teacher tell him she expected to \"look (him) up in the Cobb County jail in five years.\" Brown later shared that moment publicly as a senior in 2014, posting the comment on Twitter, a memory he has said stayed with him and fueled him.\n\nOn Friday, Brown returned to Wheeler High School in Marietta, Georgia, to see his No. 0 jersey retired, the highest honor the school can give one of its athletes. The ceremony took place during the school’s Martin Luther King Jr. assembly, where Brown spoke to students about adversity, perseverance and the importance of community, according to Boston.com.\n\nThe unveiling itself came with a hiccup: the rope snapped, delaying the reveal until someone climbed up to pull the cover off manually. Brown laughed it off, telling WSB‑TV’s Alison Mastrangelo the moment was “just fitting” and “my high school experience all wrapped up into that one moment right there.”\n\nBrown starred at Wheeler, leading the Wildcats to the 2015 Georgia Class 6A state championship and earning Gatorade Georgia Boys Basketball Player of the Year honors as a senior. He averaged 28 points and 12 rebounds that season before becoming a five‑star recruit and eventually the No. 3 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft.\n\nAs students cheered and his banner finally dropped into view, Brown smiled and pumped his fist, a moment of triumph.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY High School Sports Wire: Celtics star Jaylen Brown has high school jersey retired at Wheeler",

    "fullText": "ESPN host Stephen A. Smith has issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party ahead of this year’s pivotal midterm elections.\n\nThe longtime NBA commentator, who has hinted at a move into politics, unloaded on Trump over how he has handled the presidency so far in his second term, predicting sweeping losses for Republicans if current trends continue.\n\n“To all the Republicans out there, to all the conservatives out there, you’re about to lose the midterms. You’re going to lose. And you might lose the presidency in 2028, and it’s going to be at the fault of your president, Donald Trump,” the host said in an episode of Straight Shooter with Stephen A. that aired on Thursday.\n\nSmith is among a growing list of prominent voices warning of trouble for Trump as the midterms approach. The GOP holds narrow majorities in both the House and the Senate, leaving little margin for error.\n\nHis voice rising to nearly a shout, the ESPN pundit said Trump is “going to blow it” for the GOP.\n\n“Trump is blowing it! He’s blowing it! He’s going to blow it for himself; he’s going to blow it for the GOP; he’s going to blow it for Congress; he’s going to blow it for the Senate; and he’s likely going to blow it for the White House,” said Smith.\n\n“The man don’t know how to act,” he went on, criticizing the political climate and messaging coming from the White House.\n\n“What you’re hearing about is Gestapo tactics on the part of ICE. What you’re hearing about is, what happened to going after the hardcore criminals and making sure to deport them, as opposed to terrorizing everyday, normal American citizens?”\n\n“What we’re hearing about is chaos, chaos, chaos. And, oh my lord, we don’t need to see this again. We don’t need to see this again. That’s what you’re hearing about. And you’re hearing a president that doesn’t know how to be quiet,” Smith said.\n\nThe ESPN host stopped short of calling Trump self-obsessed, saying he’s like “somebody addicted to carrying a microphone.”\n\n“I, your friendly neighborhood host, is on the air between ESPN and Sirius XM. I am on the air live a minimum of 22 hours a week, a minimum of 45 weeks a year—a year! Ladies and gentlemen, that equates to over 900 hours, and I’ve got nothing on Trump. Not a damn thing! He can’t stop! Every time you turn around, it’s something.”\n\nSmith also pointed to cracks among Trump’s allies.\n\nHe added: “It’s so bad right now. Even the godfather of podcasting, Joe Rogan, who endorsed Donald Trump right before the 2024 election has spoken out about him.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nWhite House deputy chief of staff James Blair has also acknowledged that the GOP faces trouble ahead, while Rep. Nancy Mace has said she’s not confident Republicans will be able to retain control of the House of Representatives in the midterms.\n\nTrump has begged Republicans to win the 2026 congressional midterm elections to stop Democrats from attempting to impeach him.",

    "fullText": "NBA fans react to Kevin Durant's masterclass vs Timberwolves originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAt age 37, Kevin Durant remains one of the most prolific scorers in the NBA.\n\nThe Houston Rockets forward put on a scoring masterclass against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night in the Rockets’ 110-105 victory in Houston, Texas.\n\nDurant checked in for 40 minutes on the night. He shot efficiently, going 11-18 from the field. He went to the free throw line for 14 attempts, where he knocked down 11 of them.\n\nFrom three, Durant went 6-8. He finished the game with nearly as many points as his minutes (39 points).\n\nIt wasn’t just his scoring, though. Durant racked up seven assists on the offensive end. Then defensively, he came down with four rebounds, while coming up with two steals and one block.\n\nKEVIN DURANT TONIGHT:\n\n39 POINTS\n7 ASSISTS\n4 REBOUNDS\n2 STEALS\n1 BLOCK\n11/18 FGM\n6/8 3PM\n+14 +/-\n40 MINUTES\n\nTIMELESS SUPERSTAR pic.twitter.com/BHPrhUajyO\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) January 17, 2026\n\nNBA Fans React to Kevin Durant’s Performance\n\n@SelvaVerse: Kevin Durant greatness aging embarrassingly well\n\n@Corner_Coyote: They got Jaden McDaniels but we got Kevin Durant\n\nWith Friday’s victory, the Rockets moved to 23-15 on the season. They are chasing the Los Angels Lakers in the Western Conference, who currently hold the fifth seed with a 24-15 record. Houston has a 0.5 game lead over Durant’s former team, the Phoenix Suns.\n\n@ismailbayirliog: Kevin Durant still doing this like it’s normal.\n\n@balldontstop: Kevin Durant is easily a top 10 basketball talent of all-time. Eye test and ability? You can argue top five. Pure skill for 18 straight years.\n\n@BiasedHouston: Perplexed at the people who *insist* the Kevin Durant trade was a mistake. We are getting blown out in this game this time last year without Fred.\n\nThe Rockets still have some key questions that need answering, but whether Durant’s still got it or not cannot be questioned. The veteran forward is likely working on a third-straight All-Star bid during his first go-round with the Rockets.\n\nIn 36 games leading up to Friday’s action, Durant has posted averages of 25.9 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 4.4 assists. He is shooting 51 percent from the field and 39 percent from three.\n\nAfter Houston’s Friday night action, they’ll look ahead to Sunday, when they host the New Orleans Pelicans for a matchup.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Timberwolves will be without their best player tonight, but they still have a chance to push the Houston Rockets toward the Play-In Tournament.\n\nThat would mark a steep fall for a team that entered the season with legitimate title aspirations following the arrival of Kevin Durant.\n\nMy Timberwolves vs. Rockets predictions recognize the immediate Minnesota value in Anthony Edwards’ absence.\n\nRead \n\nTimberwolves vs Rockets best bet: Jaden McDaniels Over 16.5 points (-105)\n\nJaden McDaniels scored 14 points in Tuesday’s first quarter at Milwaukee, which is the reason he cashed this same prop by only half a point, adding a second-quarter 3-pointer. The Minnesota Timberwolves were so walloping the Bucks that McDaniels eased up.\n\nHe has now cleared this prop in six of eight games without Anthony Edwards in the lineup this season, averaging 19.9 points in those eight games, up from 13.5 points in 31 games alongside the Minnesota superstar.\n\nMcDaniels takes 10.1 shots per game with Edwards in the lineup, jumping to 13.75 without the MVP candidate. Maybe even more notable, McDaniels’s field-goal percentage rises to 55.5% in that increased usage, up from 51.0%.\n\nThe 25-year-old is a more complete player than given credit for, and that often shows up when the Timberwolves’ best offensive player is on the bench.\n\nDoubt Houston Rockets guard Reed Sheppard in all defensive matchups. He logged 19 minutes last night and finished a team-worst minus-10.\n\nYes, it was a 20-point loss to Oklahoma City, but some of that stemmed from Sheppard’s defensive issues. Minnesota point guard Donte DiVincenzo shouldn’t need much space to score in this matchup.\n\nThe McDaniels–DiVincenzo pairing has been a key reason the Timberwolves are 5-1 ATS in their last six games without Anthony Edwards, compared to just 13-17 ATS with Edwards since Nov. 1.\n\nAs brilliant as Edwards is, Minnesota often plays with sharper focus in his absence.\n\nJaden McDaniels Over 16.5 points\n\nDonte DiVincenzo Over 14.5 points\n\nPrior to Rudy Gobert’s one-game suspension on Tuesday, he had cleared this prop in six straight games. Minnesota's center may be playing the best basketball of his career.\n\nJaden McDaniels Over 16.5 points\n\nDonte DiVincenzo Over 14.5 points\n\nSpread: Timberwolves +4.5 (-110) | Rockets -4.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Timberwolves +150 | Rockets -180\n\nOver/Under: Over 222 (-110) | Under 222 (-110)\n\nHouston has lost seven straight games against the spread, falling short of bookmakers’ expectations by an average of 13.1 points.

    "fullText": "An NBA scout has suggested that Kobe Bryant’s enduring popularity is why LeBron James still isn’t fully embraced by Los Angeles Lakers fans — even as he continues to defy expectations at 41.\n\nLeBron James missed the first 14 games of the season due to sciatica, but has since helped the Los Angeles Lakers to a 24-15 record, putting them fifth in the Western Conference.\n\nWhat LeBron is doing this season cannot go understated, as he is playing excellent basketball at 41 years of age. But not everyone is convinced that Lakers fans are fully aware of what they’re witnessing.\n\nSpeaking to Lakers Daily, an anonymous NBA scout admitted he had been wrong about LeBron James’ decline. The scout added that James has since proved him wrong, praising his form and longevity.\n\nHowever, he argued that James’ greatness isn’t fully appreciated by the Lakers fanbase due to their unwavering support for the late Kobe Bryant.\n\n“I thought he was done after the Suns and Raptors games. He looked so bad on both ends of the floor. I was like, ‘Yeah, Father Time finally got LeBron.’”\n\n“It’s too bad he’s on the Lakers because those fans will never truly appreciate the greatness they are seeing because they are loyal to Kobe, which is stupid because Kobe loved LeBron.”\n\n“Ever since that Raptors game, he has looked unbelievable. He looks like a top-10 player in the league again. It’s incredible. We will never see a player be this good for so long ever again.”\n\nLeBron James has averaged 22.7 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.8 rebounds this season, continuing to lead the LA Lakers in key categories.\n\nSince his return, the team has gone 13-9 in games he has played, with his leadership and playmaking driving their push up the Western Conference standings.\n\nThe 21-time All-Star’s ability to sustain elite production this season has left scouts, analysts, and fans in disbelief.\n\nEven at 41, his physicality and consistency remain unmatched, a testament to his preparation and longevity in a league that rarely spares aging players.\n\nWhile comparisons to Kobe Bryant have long defined his tenure in Los Angeles, the scout’s comments suggest James’ accomplishments may never be fully appreciated by some sections of the Lakers fanbase — even as he continues to rewrite NBA history in purple and gold.",

It was previously clear that Black Ops 7 would have a hard time repeating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's chart-topping performance in 2024. But the latest Call of Duty installment fell to No. 7 in America/Canada and Europe. By contrast, Battlefield 6 performed very well in both territories, with a No. 2 finish in North America and a fifth place slot in Europe. Through the end of November 2025, Circana had Battlefield 6 as the best-selling game of the year. But this particular list is only for PlayStation Store downloads and it doesn't count sales on other consoles or PC.\n\nThe lists contained some returning favorites like Minecraft and Helldivers 2, but newcomers like Arc Raiders, Ghost of Yotei, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made the cut in North America as well.\n\nAmong PlayStation 4 games, Red Dead Redemption 2 claimed No. 1 in both territories. Rockstar Games' 2018 open-world western has remained remarkably resilient, as has Grand Theft Auto 5, which placed highly on both the PS5 and PS4 lists.\n\nBeat Saber also claimed the top slots in America/Canada and Europe's PSVR 2 Games charts, and repeated its wins from 2024.

Curry, the 1994 Sixth Man of the Year, ranks second in points in franchise history and spent 10 of his 16 NBA seasons in Charlotte (1988-98). He currently serves as a team ambassador. pic.twitter.com/coSL3ntP5a\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) January 14, 2026\n\nCurry is now more widely recognized as the father of Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry. However, long before his eldest son started making waves in the NBA and rewriting records, Dell was known as one of the best long-distance shooters of his era.\n\nCharlotte was fortunate to have Dell Curry for 10 of his 16 years in the league. During his tenure with the Hornets, the team made four appearances in the Eastern Conference playoffs, advancing to the semifinals on two occasions. Curry played much of his career in a reserve or sixth-man role and earned the Sixth Man of the Year award during the 1993-94 season.\n\nThat year, Curry played all 82 games, averaging a career-high 16.3 points, along with 3.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists, while shooting 40.2% from three-point range. The season before winning the Sixth Man award, Curry finished fourth in voting, and he remained in the top five in two of the three seasons following his win. In 1994-95, he finished second behind New York Knicks power forward Anthony Mason for the Sixth Man Award.\n\nAlthough Curry played for five different teams over his career, his prime years and best on-court performance were with Charlotte. During his decade with the Hornets, he averaged 14 points, 2.9 rebounds, 2 assists, 1.1 steals, and shot 40.5% from three.\n\nIn recent years, Curry has served as an ambassador for the Hornets and spends time watching his sons, Stephen and Seth, drain threes from all over the court. Dell is also a broadcaster for the Hornets, calling games on FanDuel and Amazon Prime Video’s NBA coverage.",

    "title": "Rudy Gobert, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Michael Porter Jr., Jaylen Brown among NBA surprises",
    "description": "Here are four players who have taken leaps in the first half of the 2025-26 season.",
    "fullText": "There have been plenty of nice developments through the first half of this NBA season. Jalen Johnson, Jalen Duren, Deni Avdija, Jamal Murray, and Chet Holmgren will probably make their first All-Star team. Plenty will be written about them in the future.\n\nDevelopment happens at all levels though. Sometimes those other improvements from players who are already great or those who fall just below the All-Star level fly more under-the-radar. Here are four examples of surprise players that haven't gotten quite as much attention as they might deserve, ranging from potential MVPs to my Most Improved Player of the first half.\n\nNBA POWER RANKINGS: Thunder's lead shrinks on the field\n\nFour years ago, when Alexander-Walker first played for Quin Snyder in Utah, he couldn't get consistent playing time. Even as a quality role player for the Wolves, he started only 30 of his 187 regular season games. In Atlanta, he's become one of Snyder's most reliable starters.\n\nAlexander-Walker carved out a role for himself earlier in his career as a defensive pest who could do a little bit of playmaking and shoot 3's. He averaged a modest 9.4 points per game last season and 8.6 for his career.\n\nNAW's offensive explosion up to 20.6 points per game this season is an 11.2 point increase from last year. That is significantly more than the 8.3 increase of his teammate and last year's Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels. It's somewhat mystifying then that NAW is rarely mentioned in the discussion for that award.\n\nNAW has become a dynamite driver to the left, using his weak hand to excel as one of the Hawks' primary playmakers. When he gets into the paint, his slithery-smooth finishes from everywhere on the floor are reminiscent of his cousin Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nBeautiful finish by NAW 😍 pic.twitter.com/wpNW4bII1b\n\n— Atlanta Hawks (@ATLHawks) January 10, 2026\n\nNobody could have expected this type of growth from Alexander-Walker. Well, almost nobody. Shai's father Vaughan Alexander trained both boys and always saw the potential in Nickeil, who was the better player growing up.\n\n\"Nickeil is going to be a star,\" Vaughan told me at the beginning of the year. \"Remember, I'm going to be the first to tell you that you're going to see that. You're going to say, 'Oh my God, he got so much better! Oh my God, he learned how to play!' No. That's been Nickeil from Day One.\"\n\nUncle Vaughan was right on that one.\n\nMORE: Hawks-Wizards Trae Young trade grades\n\nGobert has always had one of the ugliest offensive bags in the league. His lack of skill development on that side of the ball is one of the reasons why many considered him to be overrated during his prime.\n\nThose haters have to give Gobert credit. There are still some rough moments, but he has clearly put in work on that side of the ball. He's had some shocking highlight passes and buckets this season, showing real touch, skill, and shot creation that he didn't have in previous seasons.\n\nRUDY GOBERT ON HIS HEAD\n\n🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 pic.twitter.com/dwf2Qk39KT\n\n— Minnesota Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) January 5, 2026\n\n\"He's been phenomenal,\" Anthony Edwards told Wolves reporter Dane Moore. \"His catching has gotten tremendous. It's crazy. He's catching everything now... Somebody like that I love to play with because he's willing to grow.\"\n\nGobert is an ultra-efficient offensive player. He had a streak earlier in the year of a franchise-record 18 consecutive makes, and he's leading the league with an absurd 71.7 percent field goal percentage. That's in addition to pulling down four offensive rebounds per game and setting great screens for teammates.\n\nGobert's value still comes primarily from defense, where he has quietly put together a season that should have him in contention for his fifth Defensive Player of the Year trophy. The offense has been a nice bonus, and it seems like everyone is sleeping on both his season and the Wolves as real title contenders.\n\nNobody expected Boston to be the No. 3 seed in the East halfway through the season. They've gotten there thanks to the No. 2 offense in the league. Jaylen Brown is the engine that is driving them to that surprising result.\n\nBrown is averaging career-highs in points per game (29.5), field goal percentage (49.5 percent), and assists per game (5.0). He's had some huge scoring outbursts, including a 50-point game against the Clippers. And his nine consecutive 30-point games in December tied Larry Bird's franchise record.\n\nBrown has been able to handle a much larger portion of the offense in large part because of how much more balanced his game has become. His left hand has been a weakness of his for many years. He's clearly worked on it, and coaches around the league are noticing.\n\n\"He used to be right-hand dominant. He's now using his left hand equally good as right,\" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic told CLNS' Bobby Manning.\n\nThe other development that has made Brown harder to stop has been his increased reliance on his midrange shot. His 216 jumpers from between the free throw and 3-point line at the halfway point of the year are already more than the 144 that he took in all 63 of his games last season.\n\nThat's a tough shot to make a living on, but he's hitting a very solid 48 percent of them per Cleaning the Glass. That gives the Celtics an option late in the clock, and it also makes Brown a threat from anywhere on the floor.\n\nBrown has played his way into First Team All-NBA discussion. He should get a handful of MVP votes thrown his way at the end of the year.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. proved during his time in Denver that he was an elite shooter next to Nikola Jokic. How would that translate on a new team where he would have to create open looks for himself? He's answered that question resoundingly, averaging 26 points per game on great efficiency.\n\nPorter was a one-dimensional scorer in Denver who earned the nickname \"never swing the rock\" on social media platforms. He would oftentimes miss wide open teammates under the basket as he launched contested jumpers. That has changed too in Brooklyn, where he is shockingly fourth on the team in assists per game.\n\nPorter should be the most sought-after trade acquisition for any contender. He's proven he can play both on and off the ball for a championship-level team.",

    "title": "Former NBA veteran gives caution to Fred Warner returning from his ankle injury",
    "description": "There is a counterargument to 49ers LB Fred Warner returning for the playoffs",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have floated around the NFC Championship as a potential game for linebacker Fred Warner to return. Warner has not appeared in a game since October 12, when he dislocated his ankle in Week 6.\n\nAfter Sunday’s game, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said the chances are “Not very high” of Warner playing in the Divisional Round. The team playing on a short week could certainly influence Shanahan’s decision.\n\nWarner has different ideas. He uploaded a video of himself doing drills on Monday:\n\n.@fred_warner showing his recovery progress 👀\n\n(via @fred_warner) pic.twitter.com/X94flz0i1l\n\nOn The Ryen Russillo Show, before Wild Card weekend, Warner said:\n\n“I’m ready whenever they’re ready. There’s some T’s that gotta be crossed, I’s that gotta be dotted. Unfortunately, if it were just up to me, I’d be out there this weekend, but it’s unfortunately not that way. I’ve got to make sure I’m checking all the boxes, and everybody has to give me the okay before they let me go out there. But I’m pushing, man. I’m training hard. I’m back doing full football drills and everything, so time will tell. We gotta pull the win off first.”\n\nThis could also be a scenario where the team is protecting Warner from himself. In his mind, he was probably ready to play in Week 17. But, as he said, every box needs to be checked. While the team would love to have Warner on the field in the Divisional Round, the last thing they want to do is sacrifice the longevity of his career.\n\nFormer NBA all-star Michael Redd, who played from 2000 to 2012, shared his thoughts on the topic:\n\nLooks like a near-miraculous comeback. Near, but not totally. Here’s my OG advice no one asked for: We’ve seen this play out before. Could name countless examples, but let’s go…Brandon Roy came back in 8 days from meniscus surgery in 2010. Retired at 27 with no cartilage left. Robert Williams rushed back for the Celtics playoff series in 2022, still dealing with it, seems like. KD tore his Achilles coming back too early in 2019, back but missed ton of time. Look, injuries robbed me of the back half of my career too, so I get wanting to be out there…especially for the playoffs. But take your time. Come back 100%. You’re not the difference between winning a title or not. And if you are? You’ll be that guy next year too. Your body is your career. Have to protect it. Fans will understand and appreciate the extra good years that you/they get out of it!\n\nWarner was in the conversation for Defensive Player of the Year before sustaining an ankle injury, so there’s a strong argument that he could be the difference in winning a title or not. But that doesn’t make Redd’s point moot.\n\nWarner is under contract for four more seasons. There are no guarantees the 49ers will be back in the playoffs, but this is a team that has proven to be a consistent postseason contender. Big picture, you want Warner on the field for the duration of the decade, not the 2025 regular season.\n\nRE: Fred Warner and a potential return to #49ers. This Sunday would mark 21 days until the Super Bowl. Opening his practice window at any point from then would give maximum time possible to evaluate if he's ready to go with no real down side. \n\n(That's probably true now, too,…\n\n— Nick Wagoner (@nwagoner) January 13, 2026\n\nAs Nick Wagoner stated above, the 49ers could open Warner’s practice window this week.",

    "description": "The Boston Celtics suffered a heartbreaking 98-96 loss to the Indiana Pacers today, with Pacers star Pascal Siakam delivering a game-winning basket with six seconds remaining on the clock. After the game, however, Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla didn’t shy away from expressing his feelings.",
    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics suffered a heartbreaking 98-96 loss to the Indiana Pacers today, with Pacers star Pascal Siakam delivering a game-winning basket with six seconds remaining on the clock. After the game, however, Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla didn’t shy away from expressing his feelings.\n\nIn the postgame conference, Mazzulla was asked six questions. Every single one of them met the same two-word answer: “Illegal screen.” Over and over, refusing to elaborate or pivot, and didn’t soften the message. It was almost surgical, and it made it unmistakably clear which moment he thought decided the game.\n\nDuring that key final sequence, to begin the possession, Siakam set a screen for Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard, and appeared to throw a shoulder at Derrick White, who fell while attempting to chase Nembhard past the screen. Mazzulla seemingly blamed the referees for not calling the potential illegal screen, which, in his mind, decided the game.\n\nBoston didn’t lose just from one call, and Mazzulla knows that. However, when the game comes down to one possession, that margin for error feels a lot heavier, with every potential officiating mistake being the difference between a win and a loss. This is something that has already plagued this team throughout the season.\n\nJust days ago, Celtics star Jaylen Brown unloaded on officials with an expletive-filled rant after a loss, openly inviting a fine while calling out a perceived one-sided whistle on a night the Celtics shot just four total free throws. The league reacted swiftly, handing out a $35,000 fine to the forward.\n\nTonight, the Celtics were already shorthanded, missing their leading scorer, Brown, and a key wing presence in Josh Minott, leaving Payton Pritchard and Derrick White to carry the load, logging a combined 41 points, but ultimately falling short.\n\nJoe Mazzulla has been here before. Almost two years ago, a very similar situation took place. In a game against the Pacers tied at 131, Brown took a shot with 3.1 seconds on the clock, and Pacers guard Buddy Hield hit his head in an attempt to block. However, no foul was called, and on the other end, the Pacers managed to score after Brown’s shot missed.\n\nMazzulla told reporters back then that he “can’t wait until four o’clock tomorrow,” continuously repeating the “four o’clock” phrase, referring to the time the NBA’s two-minute report releases.\n\nIn the report, however, the contact on Brown’s head was deemed incidental in the report. Still, it revealed multiple missed or mistaken calls that went against the Celtics, including a legal contest from Kristaps Porzingis as well as a missed illegal screen on Myles Turner. It seems that even Pacers players realized the foul should have been called, with Hield admitting he told Mazzulla that he fouled Brown:\n\n“I told Joe what I told Joe. But they have three refs out there and they have the replay center, and that’s what replay is for, I guess.”\n\nTonight was just deja vu for the coach and his squad. All they can do now is wait for the two-minute report and hope the NBA recognizes their pleas.\n\nThe post Disappointed Joe Mazzulla Accuse NBA Refs Using 2 Words After Celtics Loss appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Former NBA All-Star does not believe in Bam Adebayo's viability as a star player originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Heat have had a rocky season so far, possessing a 20-19 record. It has been a stellar year for players like Norman Powell and Jaime Jaquez Jr. This is a decent run for those players, but the expectations are higher for the longtime stars, which include Bam Adebayo.\n\nAs the longest-tenured player on the Heat roster, Adebayo has become a building block for the franchise. He is a tremendous defender, but he is not as good on the offensive side of the game.\n\nConsidering that he is known as one of the Heat's star players, Adebayo has been underwhelming. He is averaging 16.4 points per game, which is his lowest average since the 2019-20 season when he averaged 15.9 points a night.\n\nHe is also quite inefficient, shooting 44.6% from the field and 31.7% from beyond the arc. It has not been the prettiest of seasons for Adebayo, which has translated into some bad results for the Heat.\n\nMore: Bam Adebayo speaks on the Heat’s starting lineup struggles\n\nThis was quite evident against the Oklahoma City Thunder, as they lost 124-112. In that game, Adebayo was quite anonymous on the offensive end, scoring only six points.\n\nThat is not what is expected from a star player, and former All-Star guard Jeff Teague believes it disqualifies Adebayo from being called a star.\n\n\"Bam don’t really be killing. He’s just a good player. He’s not a star. He’s a good complimentary piece. He’s still a quality player, fringe All Star. I think if they get Ja Morant some new blood in there that can run P&Rs with him I think he’ll step up. I just don’t think he’s playing with a pure PG right now,\" Teague said on Club 520.\n\nMoving forward, the Heat might need other players who can be the true stars of the team. Tyler Herro can play that role, but he has not been fully healthy this season. Kel'el Ware might have that potential in the long run, but the Heat are stuck in limbo at the moment with their current construction.\n\nRick Carlisle announces his support for Norman Powell's All-Star campaign\n\nOKC's champion coach commends the Heat for being 'a great team to test yourself against'\n\nSpoelstra is not concerned about Tyler Herro's spot in the starting lineup amid issues\n\nTyler Herro gets honest about the 'young and fun' Miami Heat this season\n\nErik Spoelstra expresses disappointment in the Miami Heat's lack of effort",

An official team announcement confirms he is still dealing with a calf contusion.\n\nConsidering Morant’s name is back in the trade rumor mill, many see the sudden wave as absences as something deeper than a contusion.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States. At the news conference, MLB staff assembled duffel bags with goods for foster care children.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "fullText": "Carson Beck family tree: Meet sister Kylie, ex-NBA cheerleader mom and more about Florida roots originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDoes Carson Beck have a girlfriend?\n\nNot many college quarterbacks can say they had a resume the caliber of Carson Beck's.\n\nWhile both of his championships came as a backup when he played for the Georgia Bulldogs, Beck still cemented himself as a starter by 2023, when he threw for 3,941 yards and had 28 total touchdowns for Georgia. Then, Beck decided to play one last year in college, transferring to the Miami Hurricanes for a reported hefty NIL package.\n\nThose around Beck have been in the spotlight often, from his past relationship with Miami women's basketball star Hanna Cavinder, to his family, including his mom and sister.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of Beck's family tree.\n\nMORE: Why did Carson Beck transfer from Georgia to Miami?\n\nCarson Beck's sister is Kylie Beck. She is a former cheerleader and member of the dance team at Georgia, where she attended at the same time as her brother.\n\nWhen the quarterback departed Georgia for Miami, Kylie Beck, a sophomore at the time, also shared that she was leaving the Bulldogs behind. It hasn't been confirmed whether she also chose to attend Miami, but she's remained a close supporter of her brother with the Hurricanes.\n\n“Thank you letter to Athens. When one door closes, another door always opens with something greater on the other side,\" Beck wrote, per The Athlete Lifestyle on SI. \"I entered this new city hoping for greatness, success and happiness. Although there are times there was an abundance of these things, there were also times when I was at the lowest I’ve ever been and my family and I went through the hardest things we’ve ever dealt with. To say this experience has been a whirlwind of emotions would be an understatement.\n\nI am thankful that I’ve been able to call Athens my home for the past five years, traveling to games to support my brother and then making my dream a reality this past year when i was awarded the opportunity to be both a Georgette & Dance Dawg. It was such a blessing being by my brothers side and cheering him on from the field.\"\n\nLike Carson, Kylie is from Jacksonville, Florida, so the quarterback's transfer to Miami was closer to their home state.\n\nWhether as a Georgia cheerleader or just as a fan, Kylie has been a very vocal supporter of her brother's football career. She's shared plenty of social media posts about Carson.\n\nKylie Beck has also become known for her gameday outfits.\n\nKylie Beck is not a cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys. However, she was invited to dance with the Cowboys cheerleaders in March 2025, posing on the field afterward.\n\nMORE: How does NIL money work in college football?\n\nCarson Beck's mom is Tracy Beck. She grew up in Clinton, Md., went to Maryland for college and danced for the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) in the past, per The Athletic. Tracy Beck is a kindergarten teacher at Alimacani Elementary School in Jacksonville, Florida, where her kids were raised.\n\nLike the rest of Carson's family, Tracy has been a very public supporter of the quarterback's career.\n\nIn 2024, she told The Athletic that it's not \"who Carson is\" to remain in college as long as he had because of NIL.\n\n“There was no negotiating for money. That’s not who Kirby is. That’s not who this program is about, and that’s not who Carson is,” she said. “I think it’s cool he can do NIL this year and have an opportunity for all that. And those boys work so hard. I have never seen kids work as hard as they do. I mean it’s a full-time job to be a football player at the University of Georgia.\"\n\nHowever, Tracy also told The Athletic that she supports Carson's decision to buy a luxury car with his NIL money, as he's been focused on football first.\n\n“He’s so laid back and so focused on football and Georgia and his team. To him, that’s such a cool thing and be able to represent and do things for Georgia and for NIL,” she said. “But at the end of the day, talking about the car, it’s just a car. It’s very cool and amazing that he can drive something like that. But at the end of the day, it’s more about the team and coming back to try and do what they want to do this year.”\n\n\"Beck's Brigade\" is a gameday tailgate support group for Carson Beck that was started by his mother. Per Dawg Nation, Tracy Beck previously said watching Carson play always makes her nervous.\n\n“Honestly, he tells me to relax,” she said, per Dawg Nation. “I promise you that. He says ‘Don’t be nervous’ and ‘Be calm’ and ‘I’ve got this’ and ‘Tell everybody around you to not be nervous’ because it is nerve-wracking to be the quarterback’s mom and anybody’s mom.\n\n“Now some games have been close and I’ll cry at the end when we win and I’ll go out on the field.”\n\nMORE: Ranking the 19 greatest Miami players of all time\n\nCarson Beck's dad is Chris Beck. He is a former player at Navy, where he played linebacker from 1989-92, and he is now a retired Naval officer.\n\nWhen Carson Beck played for the Pablo Creek Saints, his dad was his coach, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nMORE:Carson Beck's tattoos, explained\n\nNo, Carson Beck's parents are no longer married.\n\nIt's unknown when Chris and Tracy Beck divorced, but according to EssentiallySports, the couple met in Annapolis, Maryland, before later moving to Florida and welcoming Carson in 2002, then Kylie.\n\nMORE:History of Miami QBs in the NFL, from Jim Kelly to Cam Ward\n\nAs of January 2026, Carson Beck hasn't been confirmed to be in a relationship with anyone.\n\nPreviously, he was in a high-profile relationship with Hanna Cavinder, a basketball player at Miami and popular social media influencer. Beck and Cavinder began dating in July 2024, per People, but rumors that they had split began in March 2025, not too long after Beck transferred to Miami and joined his girlfriend as a Hurricanes athlete.\n\nAt the time, per People, Cavinder had removed all signs of Beck from her Instagram profile, while her twin sister, Haley, posted on social media suggesting she had \"a gut feeling about a relationship\" and saw \"someone in my life that's hurting.\"\n\nBeck later confirmed his split with Cavinder to ESPN, saying, \"You make mistakes as a person, but it sucks that you have to go through something like that with someone that you care about, and now it's all over the Internet.\"\n\n\"Half of what you see in the media is true,\" Beck told ESPN. \"Half of what you see is not true. So, people pick their side of the story and run with it. The people that know the truth know the truth. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nMORE: When is the last time Miami won a championship in football?\n\nCarson Beck was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. He attended Mandarin High School; in 2018, he won the Florida \"Mr. Football\" award after throwing for 3,546 yards and 30 touchdowns as a junior.\n\nBeck led Mandarin to a state championship, and after initially committing to Florida as a baseball prospect, he switched to college football. Beck first committed to Alabama, then flipped his decision to Georgia and joined the Bulldogs in 2020.\n\nHas Carson Beck won a championship?",

    "fullText": "Tyler Herro gets honest about the 'young and fun' Miami Heat this season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a long while with many veterans on the team, the Miami Heat have embraced a younger squad this season. Head coach Erik Spoelstra has implemented a run-and-gun system this season, which has been quite helpful to players like Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Pelle Larsson.\n\nTyler Herro and Bam Adebayo were once the youngsters of the Heat roster, but now, they are considered the veterans. They are excited about playing for the Heat as the reliable veterans and leaders of this mostly young squad.\n\nThe current Heat rotation is filled to the brim with talented youngsters. Names like Jaquez, Larsson, and Nikola Jovic are some of the most promising players on the roster. They fit Spoelstra's new vision of working hard and playing hard at a fast pace.\n\nFor Herro and Adebayo, this can be jarring, especially since they played in a Jimmy Butler-centric system. Now that Butler is with the Golden State Warriors, Spoelstra and his system have become much more fast-paced.\n\nMore: Heat's Tyler Herro made NBA 3-point history 1 game faster than Steph Curry\n\nHerro is glad and happy to play in this current iteration of the Heat. It has been a rough season for him because he missed plenty of games with an injury. Now that he has returned, the team is ecstatic about his comeback, while he is playing with more youthful players.\n\n\"This team, we're young and fun. We got energy, being on the sideline, that’s one thing I noticed since this season started. I've seen the game through a different lens than on the court. Everyone is coachable and understanding of each other so far. It’s like everyone is for each other this year; that goes a long way,\" Herro said in response to a question about the current roster.\n\nMoving forward, the Heat have a promising future with the current squad. It will be a challenging stretch, but in the long run, they could keep developing into a better team. With a good mix of experience and youth, Spoelstra has a strong team that could be even better in the long-term future.\n\nErik Spoelstra expresses disappointment in the Miami Heat's lack of effort\n\nBam Adebayo ties second all-time for field goals made in Heat history\n\nNorman Powell continues his All-Star campaign this season 'Hopefully it happens for me'\n\nMiami's top defender Davion Mitchell seen as a huge threat to Anthony Edwards\n\nNBA trade rumors: Ranking 9 most likely stars to be traded, from Giannis Antetokounmpo to Anthony Davis",

    "fullText": "CJ McCollum reacts to being traded to Atlanta Hawks for Trae Young originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCJ McCollum’s brief tenure with the Washington Wizards has come to an end.\n\nThe veteran guard was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, along with Corey Kispert, for star guard Trae Young. The Hawks will be McCollum’s fourth team in the league following stints with the Portland Trail Blazers, New Orleans Pelicans and Wizards.\n\nMcCollum was traded from New Orleans to Washington during the 2025 NBA Draft. In all, he appeared in 35 games for Washington and posted averages of 18.8 points, 3.6 assists and 3.5 rebounds in 30.9 minutes per performance.\n\nAfter news of the trade broke, McCollum, 34, reacted to the deal by expressing gratitude for his time in D.C. and excitement about his future in Atlanta.\n\n“Loved my time in DC,” McCollum said, via NBA insider Chris Haynes. “Organization was great to my family and I. Michael Winger and Will [Dawkins] did everything they said they would and kept their word from the very beginning. Love the city and they’re doing things the right way over there.\n\n\"Exited to get to The A and get to work. Very familiar with their style of play. Love the ownership group and front office. Good group of players.”\n\nIt certainly doesn’t sound like McCollum harbors any ill will towards the Wizards organization for trading him, but if he does, he won’t have to wait too long to exact some revenge. The Hawks will host the Wizards for back-to-back games on Feb. 24 and 26.\n\nUltimately, McCollum's stay in Atlanta, like his stay in Washington, could be a short one. He's headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and there's no guarantee that he'll be back in Atlanta. But, if he proves to be a valuable addition to the Hawks this season, he'll boost his own stock in the process.",

    "fullText": "The Athletic has live coverage of Bears vs. 49ers on NFL “Sunday Night Football.”\n\nGood morning! Keep your job today. Inside:\n\nEvery moment of the past two years has felt like an inflection point for women’s basketball in America. Viewership is surging. Will they capitalize?\n\nIt kind of defeats the entire definition of an inflection point, but if there really is one, the sport has arrived at its doorstep now. Consider:\n\nThe WNBA, after a spike in popularity, is undergoing a contentious negotiation for a new collective bargaining agreement. Salaries and revenue are set to explode. The question is just how the players and league will agree to share the boom.\n\nThe sport’s rise has manifested in other ways. As recently as a couple years ago, it was standard for WNBA players — afforded meager salaries compared to those in other pro sports — to travel overseas to make big money during the offseason.\n\nEnter new leagues like Unrivaled, which opened its second season last night, and Project B, a new venture that will launch in November. While there are differences — Unrivaled is a three-on-three sport, while Project B is more akin to the full game but with a wide travel schedule — they offer similar things: more money, and player equity in the league.\n\nUnrivaled started its sophomore year with four games last night, highlighted by the Mist, an expansion franchise, winning its first game, and Rose, the defending champions, winning by 20. My favorite bit about watching these games: The league uses a modified version of the Elam Ending, in which teams play three timed quarters, but the fourth quarter is untimed. The first team to reach a certain point total (11 points more than the leading team has after three quarters) wins.\n\nI asked Ben Pickman, who wrote an excellent preview of the Unrivaled year yesterday, about whether he thinks the league has a chance to make an imprint on the larger sports world this year:\n\n“Unrivaled already excels at creating social media content that puts WNBA players fully onto viewer radars during the winter. What will be interesting is how its viewership continues to grow and whether fans become more invested in the nightly results of its games. The league’s viewership on TNT and truTV in Year 1 was comparable to the NWSL’s viewership on ESPN networks this past season, and though it is far behind the WNBA’s viewership, the two leagues are of course at varying points in their history.”\n\nBen also made an interesting point to me: With the NBA off TNT, Paige Bueckers, who plays for the Breeze, is the second-most famous athlete broadcast by TNT Sports, behind only Shohei Ohtani.\n\nThese are exciting things. Let’s move on to something a little more dour:\n\nWe discussed the looming specter of “Black Monday” yesterday — the day most NFL coaches get fired. That part came to fruition. What we didn’t expect was the firings to extend beyond the American version of football.\n\nCleveland canned Kevin Stefanski after six years in charge, which saw two playoff appearances, a disastrous trade for Deshaun Watson and a sack record all achieved amid boggling highs and lows. Jason Lloyd writes that, despite those temporary highs, Stefanski leaves behind a lot of bad things.\n\nThe Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon after three largely unsuccessful seasons. He finishes his tenure 15-36 with no playoff appearances. Tough timing after the team’s X account wished him a happy birthday Sunday.\n\nPete Carroll is officially one-and-done in Las Vegas, which feels like a sad line in what probably will be a Hall of Fame career (a convo for another day). General manager John Spytek, hired last offseason with Carroll, will remain in his role and help Tom Brady with the coaching search. What a weird year.\n\nWe’ll have to wait on movement for replacements, as plenty of those candidates are still coaching for playoff teams. One curious name to consider, though: Philip Rivers.\n\nNow, to the surprising news from across the ocean we briefly mentioned yesterday:\n\nManchester United is done with manager Ruben Amorim after a maddening 14-month tenure that began with lofty promise. Amorim’s critics viewed him as inflexible, though his tactics were successful elsewhere. Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League table last season and sits sixth right now. One thing will be missed: Amorim’s bizarre news conferences.\n\nIn other soccer sacking news, Celtic parted with Wilfried Nancy after just 33 days in charge. He joined Dec. 3 after a stint with the Columbus Crew. His early dismissal set records.\n\nWoof. Let’s move on to some more … normal news.\n\nHawks, Young working on trade\n\nAtlanta and star guard Trae Young are discussing a possible trade, a source confirmed to The Athletic, which has been a long time coming on a few different levels. Young is still just 27 and in his prime, and still possesses the ability to be an elite scorer. But it’s very clear the Hawks are a better team without him this year, and he can enter free agency after the season. Read our full story here, which includes a potential suitor.\n\nMontana State wins wild FCS title game\n\nMontana State won its first FCS championship since 1984 last night, 35-34 over Illinois State, which had become the Cinderella of the FCS tournament bracket. The game itself was unhinged, and ended after the Bobcats converted a fourth-and-10 for a touchdown in overtime on a pass from quarterback Justin Lamson to Taco Dowler (sweet name). That was merely the caboose for what transpired in the minutes before. The full recap is worth a read.\n\nSweden outlasted Czechia to win its first World Juniors gold medal since 2012 yesterday. More details inside.\n\nIndiana and Alabama drew a record 23.9 million viewers for their Rose Bowl matchup. Yowza.\n\nDolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is open to a fresh start with a new team. Hm.\n\nColts cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. said yesterday he is considering retirement after suffering three concussions this season. Read the 29-year-old’s full comments.\n\nTough flip: Notre Dame quarterback Kenny Minchey is heading to Kentucky, just hours after he committed to Nebraska.\n\nF1 driver Checo Pérez said being Max Verstappen’s teammate at Red Bull was the “worst job.” Yikes.\n\n📺 NCAAM: Duke at Louisville\n\n7 p.m. ET on ESPN\n\nThe Blue Devils are ranked No. 6 and have the star power, while the Cardinals are No. 20 and still favored in this game. Sounds like a good sell to me.\n\n📺 NHL: Panthers at Maple Leafs\n\n7:30 p.m. ET on TNT and HBO Max\n\nThe defending champions have steadied a bit after a tough start to the season, while Toronto remains moribund, which has been a slow-burn surprise. \n\n📺 NBA: Heat at Timberwolves\n\n8 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock\n\nThe best NBA game of the evening is here, and it’s funny that the 23-13 Timberwolves are flying under the proverbial radar a bit. Still great with a Tier 1 scorer, but sitting sixth in the West and biding time until the playoffs. Don’t sleep on them, though.\n\nGet tickets to games like these here.\n\nWe had a scheduling mix-up last week, for which we apologize. Here is the excellent story we promised you then: Katie Whyatt’s look at how sex workers have increasingly used European soccer clubs as sort of a brand boost on social media. Read it here.\n\nNick Baumgardner has a new 2026 NFL mock draft with Oregon QB Dante Moore going No. 1 to Las Vegas. Moore might be deciding between being the No. 1 pick and staying in college.\n\nDan Duggan tore into Giants ownership yesterday for retaining general manager Joe Schoen, arguing the franchise has “no standards anymore.” Make time for this one.\n\nImportant table-setter: Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon update us on where the Cubs, Yankees and Blue Jays stand as the MLB offseason withers away.\n\nMost-clicked in the newsletter yesterday: NFL playoff schedule.\n\nMost-read on the website yesterday: Our projections of every NFL playoff team’s odds to win the Super Bowl.\n\n📫 That’s all for now!

    "fullText": "Monday’s NBA and NHL slates present plenty of betting opportunities as teams hit midseason form and trends across both leagues turn into dependable indicators. As January rolls on, separation on the hardwood and ice sharpens betting lines, creating clearer opportunities at the window.  Here are tonight’s best bets brought to you by BetOnline.ag. All new players get a 50% welcome bonus and up to $250 in free bets.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Kings (17-14-9) wrap up a two-game home set against the Minnesota Wild (25-10-8) on Monday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nLos Angeles enters tonight’s contest riding the momentum of a 5-4 shootout win over Minnesota on Saturday, a result that stood out given the Kings’ season-long offensive struggles. Ranked 31st in goals per game, Los Angeles capitalized on its chances against a Wild team that had won eight of its previous 10 contests, with Adrian Kempe recording a two-point night to spark the breakthrough performance. While the final score reflected a wide-open game, much of the damage came from situational lapses rather than sustained offensive pressure.\n\nDespite Saturday’s nine-goal outburst, both teams continue to lean on structure and goal prevention as their foundation. The Kings rank third in the NHL in goals allowed per game (2.65), relying on disciplined defensive-zone coverage and limiting high-danger chances, a style that has pushed 22 of their 40 games (55%) below the posted total. Minnesota enters with a similar identity, excelling at controlling tempo and suppressing second-chance opportunities.\n\nExpect a sharper, more methodical approach in the rematch, with both teams tightening neutral-zone play and limiting rush chances. With goaltending and defensive structure likely to dictate the pace, this matchup sets up for a lower-scoring outcome this time around.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Clippers (12-22) close out a five-game homestand on Monday night as they host the Golden State Warriors (19-17) at Intuit Dome.\n\nLos Angeles looks to rebound after a 31-point blowout loss to Boston that snapped its six-game winning streak and dropped the Clippers back to 10 games under the .500 mark. Jaylen Brown’s 50-point outburst exposed some of Los Angeles’ season-long offensive issues, as the Clippers continue to rank near the bottom of the league in scoring efficiency. Despite the uneven record, Los Angeles’ recent surge has translated to the betting market, covering seven of its last 10 games and posting an 8–8 record against the spread when listed as underdogs of 2.5 points or more. Kawhi Leonard and James Harden will be tasked with generating efficient looks against a Golden State defense that ranks seventh in the NBA in points allowed (113.9 per game) and does a strong job limiting perimeter scoring.\n\nOn the other side, Golden State enters playing its best basketball in weeks, winning six of its last eight contests behind the continued brilliance of Stephen Curry. At 37 years old, Curry remains the engine of the Warriors’ offense, averaging 28.8 points per game, ninth-highest in the league. While Golden State’s recent success has boosted its position in the standings, it has not consistently carried over to the betting window, as the Warriors have covered just three of their last 10 games and sit 15-21 ATS on the season. As favorites of 2.5 points or more, Golden State has struggled to separate, owning a 9-14-1 ATS record in those spots.\n\nExpect Los Angeles to lean on home-court energy and create opportunities in key spots, keeping this matchup within a single possession as the final buzzer sounds.",

    "fullText": "Devin Booker drilled the game-winning three-pointer in the final second as the Phoenix Suns rallied to silence the NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder 108-105 on Sunday.\n\nThe Suns erased an early 18-point deficit to avenge the worst defeat in franchise history -- a 138-89 loss to the league-leading Thunder in the NBA Cup quarter-finals last month.\n\nBooker scored 24 points and handed out nine assists and Dillon Brooks added 22 for Phoenix -- which had a career-high 26 points off the bench from Jordan Goodwin.\n\nBrooks drained a three-pointer over Canada teammate and Oklahoma City's reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with 36 seconds remaining.\n\nThat gave Phoenix a 105-101 lead, but Oklahoma City tied it at 105-105 with 8.2 seconds left before Booker connected.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 25 points and Jalen Williams added 23, but the Suns snapped Oklahoma City's four-game winning streak.\n\nThe Thunder's 30-6 record remains the best in the league, while Detroit boosted their Eastern Conference lead with a 114-110 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers that moved the Pistons to 26-9.\n\nCade Cunningham scored 27 points and reserve Daniss Jenkins added 25 -- including 21 in a dazzling second quarter for Detroit.\n\nStar guard Cunningham added six rebounds, seven assists, two steals and a blocked shot as the Pistons shrugged off the injury absences of key contributors Tobias Harris, Jalen Duren and Caris LeVert.\n\nBut Jenkins stole the show with his monster second quarter in which he made all seven of his shots, including six three-pointers.\n\n\"My teammates were just finding me and I was open,\" said Jenkins, who is playing on a two-way contract. \"I was given space and the key to the game was (if) you've got an open shot, you've got to shoot.\"\n\nThe Cavs, led by 30 points from Donovan Mitchell, whittled a 13-point deficit to two with 1:16 remaining and were within two again with 3.8 seconds left, but Jenkins made two free throws to seal it.\n\nThe Cavaliers, touted at the start of the season as contenders in the East, finished the day eighth in the standings after being overtaken by the Miami Heat, who beat the New Orleans Pelicans 125-106.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers closed the weekend with a 120-114 clutch home win over the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nLuka Doncic scored 36 points with nine rebounds and eight assists.\n\nLeBron James and Jake LaRavia added 26 points each for the Lakers, who erased a 16-point deficit and finally pulled away late in a game in which the Grizzlies led by one point with 5:29 remaining.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indiana Pacers matched a franchise record for futility with their 12th straight defeat, falling 135-127 to the Magic in Orlando.\n\nThe Pacers have been a shadow of the team that fell in last season's NBA Finals, with a string of players hit by injuries since star Tyrese Haliburton suffered a torn Achilles tendon in the championship series.\n\nPacers forward Pascal Siakam led all scorers with 34 points, but the Magic -- led by 31 points from Desmond Bane -- seized control with a 17-0 run in the second quarter and held on in the face of a late Pacers surge.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets took advantage of Denver star Nikola Jokic's absence to beat the Nuggets 127-115.\n\nIn their third game since Jokic’s injury, the Nuggets fell despite the return of Christian Braun and Aaron Gordon from long injury absences.\n\nJamal Murray led Denver with 27 points and set a career high with 16 assists. Braun finished with three points in 24 minutes while Gordon had 20 points in 21 minutes.\n\nBut without three-time Most Valuable Player Jokic it wasn't enough, thanks largely to the efforts of former Nugget Michael Porter Jr -- who scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in his first meeting with the Nuggets since he was traded in July.",

    "fullText": "AJ Dybantsa has lived up to his billing this season as the potential No. 1 overall selection in the 2026 NBA draft. The BYU 18-year-old freshman — originally from Brockton — is dominating college basketball defenders at the moment.\n\nEarlier in the season, Dybantsa dropped 25 points at Madison Square Garden in front of Jaylen Brown and Derrick White in attendance, and AJ has stockpiled those kinds of scoring performances as the season has gone on.\n\nBleacher Report’s Andy Bailey recently predicted that Dybantsa will indeed be the first pick in the draft, despite competition from two other guys.\n\n“Right now, there are three very real contenders to be the top pick in the 2026 draft: Cameron Boozer, Darryn Peterson and AJ Dybantsa,” Bailey wrote on January 1.\n\n“All three have been incredibly productive as freshmen. And the talent gaps between them (assuming there are any) are small enough that it might come down to which team wins the lottery.”\n\n“If someone needs a bigger forward, Boozer would be the pick,” Bailey continued. “A team in need of a dynamic lead guard could go with Peterson. But Dybantsa checks boxes that both of the others do, and wing is the easiest player archetype to build around. And if Dybantsa keeps playing through conference games the way he has in his last six appearances (when he’s averaged 27.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.3 steals), he’ll enter the summer with a ton of momentum.”\n\nPotential No. 1 pick AJ Dybantsa's last 7 games:\n\n24 PTS | 8-15 FG | 8 REB | 3 AST\n33 PTS | 11-13 FG | 10 REB | 10 AST\n35 PTS | 9-12 FG | 6 REB | 4 AST\n23 PTS | 8-14 FG | 10 REB\n26 PTS | 11-17 FG | 8 REB | 7 AST\n28 PTS | 9-17 FG | 9 REB | 6 AST\n22 PTS | 10-15 FG | 5 REB | 5 AST pic.twitter.com/2LkrcwPCqO\n\n— B/R Hoops (@brhoops) January 3, 2026\n\nDybantsa has electrified BYU basketball in his first 14 games played. The 6-foot-8 wing, a preseason AP All-American, joined the Cougars after reclassifying and committing in late 2024.\n\nEarly on in the season, Dybantsa faced challenges, including a narrow 86-84 loss to UConn where he contributed despite team struggles. But he ignited in December. His standout effort came against Clemson on December 9, engineering a 22-point comeback by scoring or assisting on 34 of BYU’s 45 second-half points in a 67-64 victory. He followed with a career-high 35 points versus Abilene Christian and made NCAA history on December 23 against Eastern Washington, posting the youngest-ever 30-point triple-double: 33 points on 11-of-13 shooting, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.\n\nEntering Big 12 play, Dybantsa earned Lute Olson National Player of the Week on December 15 and Big 12 Player of the Week on December 30. In the conference opener on January 3, he scored 24 points despite seven turnovers, leading No. 10 BYU to an 83-73 road win over Kansas State, extending their streak to 10 victories. Through early January, he’s averaging 23.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 3.8 assists on 59.1 percent shooting, positioning BYU as a Final Four contender while solidifying his NBA Draft stock.\n\nLeBron James Retirement Timeline Predicted By Andy Bailey",

Brown’s contributions have been a major reason why the Celtics aren’t slipping in the Eastern Conference without Jayson Tatum.\n\nThe Celtics visited the red-hot Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night, and the momentum meant nothing to Brown. He put together a standout outing, which set NBA fans off.\n\nJaylen Brown vs Clippers:\n\n50 PTS\n6 AST\n16-26 FG\n6-10 3P\n\nJoins Tatum and Bird as the only Celtics with multiple 50-point games. pic.twitter.com/hCnOr4H0eM\n\n— StatMuse (@statmuse) January 4, 2026\n\nIn 35 minutes, Brown shot 18-26 from the field, going 60 percent from three.\n\nThe star dropped 50 points in the Celtics’ blowout win over the Clippers.\n\n@Adin_kiddactiv: MVP and they gave Brunson the POTM over him LOL.\n\n@masonfoster21: All NBA second team, all star starter!\n\n@remiaxyz: jaylen went crazy today\n\nThe points will be all of the talk surrounding Brown, but he contributed in other ways as well. The star guard generated five assists, while turning the ball over just twice. He also had three rebounds.\n\n@TruckBon: oh my gosh JB u are a demon\n\n@Wunderxotwod: LEAGUE MESSED UP\n\n@a1anthony: He is in MVP convos\n\n@Zeke_UTD: Took that player of the month seriously\n\nEarlier this week, the NBA announced the Players of the Month for December. Brown was hoping to see his name representing the Eastern Conference, but he landed an honorable mention.\n\nThe league chose Jalen Brunson of the New York Knicks, which clearly struck a nerve with Brown. Not only did he send out a direct social media reaction to the news, but he addressed it on a live stream, claiming he had the best stretch to close out 2025.\n\nSaturday’s 146-115 win was clearly a statement from Brown.\n\nHeading into Saturday’s action, Brown was averaging 29.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 50 assists per game. He is shooting 50 percent from the field and 35 percent from three this season.\n\nAfter the Celtics improved to 21-12 on Saturday, they maintain their spot as the third seed in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics will be back on the court on Monday to host the Chicago Bulls.",

    "description": "Jalen Suggs has worn his headband on his neck in a peculiar fashion choice. The NBA isn't happy.",
    "fullText": "Orlando Magic guard Jalen Suggs has made the unusual fashion choice of wearing his headband around his neck this season. It's a nod to his \"football drip\" from high school, Suggs explains, as he was a prized quarterback who held a scholarship offer from SEC powerhouse Georgia before taking the basketball path at Gonzaga.\n\nWhether you like the headband-on-neck look or not, the NBA has taken it away. The Magic broadcast revealed Friday that Suggs has been banned from styling his headband the way he has been. It harkens back to when the NBA banned players from wearing double headbands after Tim Thomas briefly tried to popularize the trend while playing for the Milwaukee Bucks in 2002.\n\nIt's worth noting Suggs never wore the headband around his neck for the entire game. He'd play the first few minutes with it there before transferring the headband to its standard position around his forehead.\n\nKendra Douglas mentions that the league told Jalen Suggs that the headband must be on his head to begin basketball games pic.twitter.com/ap3UqPKyKf\n\n— The Magic Way (@MagicFilmRoom) January 3, 2026\n\nJalen Suggs getting the “neck headband” banned by the NBA reminds me of when Tim Thomas got the “double headband” banned in 2002 pic.twitter.com/y28I07W26R\n\n— Average Basketball Players (@avgbballplayers) January 3, 2026\n\nSuggs is averaging 15 points, 4.7 assists and 3.7 assists this season. He's an excellent perimeter defender with 1.9 steals per game. The former No. 5 overall pick has missed time with a hip contusion and knee strain, however, prompting concern considering he's only played more than 53 games once across his first four NBA seasons.\n\nOrlando will hope to have Suggs healthy and as tenacious as ever for the playoffs, though he won't have his signature look.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Is Magic star Jalen Suggs banned from wearing headband on his neck?",

The head coach, JJ Redick, reached a breaking point, calling out his team for its lack of execution, and the players aren’t exactly pushing back.\n\nThe seven losses occurred against the Phoenix Suns, Boston Celtics, San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Clippers, Houston Rockets, and the Detroit Pistons. Everybody listed is within the postseason picture for the time being, which isn’t a great look for a Lakers team that wants to contend for a title.\n\nThe Lakers are back on the court on Saturday night to take on the Memphis Grizzlies.

There are now 14 players ahead of Westbrook on the NBA's all-time leading scorer list and only three of them are guards: Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, James Harden. Jordan and Bryant are both quintessential shooting guards, while Harden has spent his career in more of a combo role.\n\nWestbrook has spent his post-Oklahoma City Thunder career as something of a journeyman, joining the Kings this season on a one-year, $3.6 million contract (aka the veteran minimum). He has still averaged double-digit points in every season of his career and currently ranks fourth on the Kings with 14.4 points per game, his highest output since the 2022-23 season.\n\nHe also entered Friday shooting 42.3% from the field, his worst mark since 2010, but that's partially offset by a career high 35.3% clip from 3-point range.\n\nIt was a tough night if you hate seeing less-heralded Oscar Robertson records go down, as Giannis Antetokounmpo surpassed him to become the all-time leader in 30-10-5 games.

    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics have won six of seven. Jaylen Brown dropped 29 points on Thursday night in Sacramento as the Celts pulled away from the Kings late in a 120-106 victory. Boston is now 21-12 on the season, maintaining their spot as the third-best team in the Eastern Conference.\n\nFollowing Thursday’s NBA slate, the Celtics are 3.5 games back of the first-place Detroit Pistons and two games back of the second-place New York Knicks.\n\nBrown added 10 rebounds and four assists to his box score versus the Kings. The MVP candidate is now averaging 29.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 5.0 assists per game in 31 games played this season. He’s shooting 50.3 percent from the field.\n\nJaylen Brown this season\n(31 games played)\n\n29.5 PPG (50.3% FG)\n6.4 RPG\n5.0 APG pic.twitter.com/8oLbDVipYf\n\n— Celtics City (21-12) (@celticscity_) January 2, 2026\n\nBrown actually fouled out of this game late in the fourth quarter on a controversial call that Joe Mazzulla challenged. The game was already in hand at that point. It wasn’t the most efficient game for Brown (11-25 FG), but there was no one on the Kings who could stop JB whenever he felt like driving to the cup.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Brown decided to merely put his head down and use his athleticism on a straight line to the rim; no fancy moves needed. One such example occurred at the end of the first half, when Brown used a basic between-the-legs dribble to advance past the older DeMar DeRozan for a left-handed finish.\n\nJaylen to end the half. Too easy pic.twitter.com/zM94ffFiuN\n\n— Pull up shoot (@NElGHT_) January 2, 2026\n\nBoston’s second-highest scorers on the night were Derrick White and Payton Pritchard, each dropping 16 points. Sam Hauser scored 15 off the bench on an efficient 5-of-7 from 3. Anfernee Simons was similarly effective, tallying 14 off the pine (4-of-7 from distance).\n\nThe Celtics out-rebounded the Kings, 40-32. Sacramento was sharp from the line (14-15 FT) but merely room temperature from downtown (33 percent), mostly due to Russell Westbrook (2-for-9) and Dennis Schröder (3-for-8) combining for 12 long-distance bricks.\n\nNext up for the Celtics is a Saturday night showdown with the Clippers in Los Angeles. The Clips have been playing well of late and Kawhi Leonard looks rejuvenated. It’ll be a nice test for Boston.\n\nJoe Mazzulla Explains What Luka Garza Is Doing to Earn Minutes In Celtics Rotation",

    "fullText": "Lakers urged to cut ties with declining $101 million superstar before trade deadline originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are slowly slipping into mediocrity.\n\nThe franchise’s horrid defense is holding them back from greatness, as the Detroit Pistons were the latest team to give the 17-time NBA champions fits (they secured a 128-106 victory over the Lakers on Tuesday night).\n\nIn Lake Show Life’s Tyler Watts’ opinion, the Lakers’ declining superstar is also at fault for the organization’s uninspiring play, which should lead to a trade.\n\n“The Lakers have been awful with their three stars sharing the floor this season,” Watts wrote Monday. \"Luka Doncic is locked in as the centerpiece. “Los Angeles has to choose between LeBron (James) and AR (Austin Reaves) for his co-star. Both will be free agents in the offseason, and fans know what makes the most sense.”\n\n“They don’t want to trade Reaves when he’s injured, and LeBron’s value is at an all-time low. Multiple teams would still bite on King James based on the sales alone, but that is not the Laker way.”\n\n“They are known for taking care of their stars and allowing them to retire wearing the purple and gold. The Lakers should move on from LeBron, but that isn’t how they operate.”\n\n“LeBron is 41 years old and clearly declining. The Lakers have been outscored by 7.1 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor this season and have a 125.8 defensive rating. Those numbers are atrocious and resemble nothing near what a title contender puts up.”\n\nUnless James picks it up on the defensive end and shows he can play a more well-rounded brand of basketball moving forward, James will justifiably be considered a shell of his former self.\n\nAlthough a decline was bound to occur with James being the oldest player in the NBA, the 21-time All-Star shouldn’t receive a pass for his lackluster play on the hardwood.\n\nAs Watts noted, James has played well enough to generate sufficient trade interest (a deal would only work if James approved it), which would hypothetically allow the Lakers to acquire roster-bolstering contributors in a blockbuster transaction.\n\nWhether he likes it or not, James isn’t an untouchable asset in Year 23.\n\nMore NBA: Proposed Lakers trade involving LeBron James lands $110 million Warriors superstar",

    "fullText": "Christmas and the NBA have been synonymous since the league’s inception. The very first Christmas Day game was played in 1947 at Madison Square Garden between the New York Knicks and Providence Steam Rollers. The Utah Jazz themselves have been a part of this great Christmas tradition, playing eight games on the beloved holiday.\n\nJazz fans have fond memories of the six wins and probably have forgotten the two losses they’ve sustained throughout, but which is the best Jazz Christmas game? To commemorate this holiday tradition, The Lead has done its research to rank these Jazz Christmas games from worst to best.\n\nDisclaimer: there are only a select few games that have footage to go with them. Each game was ranked by the story behind it, how the game played out, and what players made the biggest impact.\n\nWhen it came to the most lackluster of the games, the Jazz vs the Phoenix Suns was the worst.\n\nThe game was played on Dec. 25, 1982, and the Jazz found themselves struggling to defend throughout the game. At one point in the third quarter, they were down by at least 20. They did manage a small comeback, but it wasn’t enough with the score being 111-101, Suns.\n\nThe only bright spots in that game were the combined effort of Jeff Wilkins, Ben Poquette, and Danny Schayes, scoring 58 of the Jazz’s 101 points. Number seven is the Jazz vs the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe seventh-place game on this list was played on Dec 25, 1977, against the Spurs (one of the last years the Jazz were in New Orleans). This game was between two 70s basketball heavyweights, Pistol Pete Maravich and George Gervin.\n\nThough the Jazz were never really close to winning, they weren’t blown out, and it was a little closer in score. Maravich led the Jazz with 27 points, four steals, and four rebounds. Gervin led the Spurs with 31 points, two blocks, five assists, and one steal. The game also gets bonus points for being the last Christmas game for the Jazz before the move to Utah.\n\nPistol Pete Maravich scored 3,667 points in 83 games over 3 years at LSU.\n\nIf you took the nation's top 83 single-game scoring performances in the last 3 years(not including this season)you'd have a combined 3,465 total points pic.twitter.com/By7PJ7WoPh\n\n— BaseballHistoryNut (@nut_history) December 4, 2025\n\nFor it being the first Christmas Day game, one would think this game would be ranked higher. However, the games to come stand out \n\nThe Jazz had a record of 11-18, though it didn’t stop them from punching above their weight. What the game lacked in story points, it earned in style points – the game was a slugfest between the two teams.\n\nThe Jazz controlled the first half of the game, then the Rockets stormed back to take the lead in the third quarter. Magic happened in the fourth, and the Jazz squeaked by to secure the two-point win over the Rockets. Any game ending with a winning shot is worth watching. Sadly, there was no found footage of the game.\n\nThe leading scorer for the Jazz was Louie Nelson with 21 points, seven rebounds, and two assists. Maravich scored 19 points and added four assists to the cause.\n\nThe fifth pick barely passed the sixth pick by being the Jazz’s first Christmas win in the twenty-first century. The year 2018 marked a new beginning for the Jazz as Gordon Hayward left for Boston and Donovan Mitchell became Utah’s new star.\n\nOn Dec 25, 2018, the league decided to give this exciting young Jazz core a chance on Santa’s big day. They were paired with a Portland Trail Blazers team, looking to prove their dominance.\n\nStyle points for this game were quite low. The first half was quite close, with Damian Lillard putting the Blazers on his back. He ended up with a stat line of 20 points, four assists, and five rebounds.\n\nOnce the Jazz got control of the game in the second half, they didn’t look back. However, player contributions were quite huge.\n\nDefensive beast Rudy Gobert had 18 points, 14 rebounds, and seven blocks. He was aided by Mitchell’s 19 points, two assists, and two rebounds. Even NBA legend Joe Ingles contributed 15 points to the Jazz’s win. Any game with Ingles deserves to be higher on the list.\n\nThis next game had both Jazz and LA Lakers greats going toe-to-toe with each other. Even though it was a blowout victory, the Jazz beating the Lakers alone makes this game legendary.\n\nThe game was a precursor to an amazing Western Conference Semifinals series between the two bruisers that same year. Magic Johnson had a good game of 18 points, 10 assists, three steals, and five rebounds.\n\nKarl Malone showed the league he was Him with 31 points, two steals, and 12 rebounds. Current Jazz color analyst Thurl Bailey added 22 points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nNot only did fans see great individual performances, but they also got to see a shoving match between Malone and Johnson. This further added to this game’s repertoire.\n\nPlayed on Christmas Day 1979, the third spot is a story full of triumph and heartbreak.\n\nThe Jazz won pretty handily against their Rocky Mountain neighbors, the Denver Nuggets. How they did it was quite phenomenal. It was a tight game through the second and third quarters. With the game on the line, the Jazz had two heroes emerge to lead them to victory.\n\nThe first player was Jazz all-timer Adrian Dantley, who came in to score 27 points and four assists. The second player to make his impact was a little-known shooting guard named Terry Furlow, who ended up scoring 37 points, five assists, and two rebounds. It was the best game of Furlow’s career.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the biggest impact he made on the league. In the waking hours of May 23, 1980, after partying, Furlow crashed into a utility pole, killing him on impact. Drugs were found in his system.\n\nLakers legend Johnson was a pallbearer at his funeral – a stark reminder of how fragile life is and how important the holidays are to see family members and friends.\n\nAt Terry Furlow’s funeral, stars like @MagicJohnson, Campy Russell, Greg Kelser, and George McGinnis were some of the pallbearers at New Jerusalem Church in Flint. See this vintage @flintjournal photo. He was truly one of the greats.\n\n— Eric Woodyard (@E_Woodyard) January 2, 2018\n\nThe second-best game was set at the height of the Jazz renaissance in the early 2020s.\n\nThe Jazz were set to face the Dallas Mavericks on Dec 25, 2021. Having their best record in years, the three-seeded Jazz were looking to show the league who they were. The Mavericks, on the other hand, were full of a young core trying to prove themselves.\n\nThe game was like two heavyweights dealing blows. The Mavericks would control the game, then the Jazz would make a run. Mitchell had a heyday even while being hampered by an injury, scoring 33 points, three assists, and three steals.\n\nKristaps Porzingis and Jalen Brunson feasted on smaller defenders, scoring a combined 54 points. It took a combined effort from Mitchell, the Flamethrower Jordan Clarkson, and the rest of the starting core to win in the fourth quarter.\n\nOut of all of the games, this was one of the most entertaining, with both teams having trouble keeping a lead. It also had great performances from individual players.\n\nIt was tough to decide between the number one and number two picks. Both were great games and featured great performances. However, number one was a better game with Jazz greats playing to their fullest. Much like pick two, the number one game was a back-and-forth conundrum.\n\nBoth the Jazz and Rockets were getting a piece of each other in the early half of the season. On Christmas Day, 1997, fans got to see a preview of an iconic playoff series. It wasn’t until the third quarter that the Jazz managed to keep a small lead.\n\nJohn Stockton robbed the world of a Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets NBA Finals.\n\nJordan, Pippen, Rodman vs. Olajuwon, Drexler, Barkley would’ve been must see TV and the Rockets owned the Bulls back then.\n\nRockets in 6 https://t.co/AEzZxM47rH pic.twitter.com/5ifMVJeO8I\n\n— V̷a̷t̷o̷r̷ (@VatorSports) May 28, 2023\n\nThe Rockets weren’t done and ended up coming back to tie the Jazz 101-101 in the fourth quarter. John Stockton took over and scored four major points to put the team ahead. Kevin Willis answered back with a tip-shot to put the Rockets within striking distance. Bryon Russell struggled off the bench but drew a foul to shoot two free throws to ice the game.\n\nStockton scored 24 points and tallied three assists, while Malone added 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Jeff Hornacek made a huge contribution as well with 20 points and nine assists.\n\nNot only did Stockton, Malone, and Hornacek outduel the likes of Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, and Willis, but it was a glimpse of a great Western Conference finals matchup, showing why this game is worthy of the number one pick.\n\nThe post What is the Best Christmas Day Game in Jazz History? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers halted a three-game losing streak with a win over the Sacramento Kings on Sunday and now look to make it two in a row when they host the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, December 30.\n\nFather Time may be undefeated, but LeBron James is still keeping him at bay. As he celebrates his 41st birthday, my Pistons vs. Lakers predictions and NBA picks anticipate another strong showing from King James.\n\nPistons vs Lakers best bet: LeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists (-115)\n\nLeBron James has played 10 games on his birthday throughout his career, averaging 32.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 6.9 assists, going for at least 35 PRA in every game played on December 30.\n\nSince his streak of double-digit scoring games was snapped on December 4, James has averaged 25.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists across eight games. He’s reached 36 PRA in five of 14 games this season, including four of his last eight.\n\nWith Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, and Rui Hachimura sidelined for the Los Angeles Lakers, James will need to take on a larger role as a scorer, rebounder, and facilitator. Tonight’s tilt with the Detroit Pistons should feature plenty of points, which means additional opportunities for James to stuff the stat sheet.\n\nJames surely understands the gravity of this moment, as he’s playing in a record-setting 23rd season and taking the court, and I expect him to make a statement tonight on his 41st birthday, showing that age is just a number.\n\nThe Lakers are 19-11 to the Over, and the Pistons are 16-15-1 O/U.\n\nLos Angeles has hit the Over in 11 of 13 home games, good for the highest percentage in the Association. The Lakers have gone Over in four of five as the home underdog. Detroit has hit the Over in two of its last three outings, including high-scoring matchups against the Utah Jazz and Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Pistons should be motivated to snap a two-game skid when they visit Crypto.com Arena tonight.\n\nDetroit most recently fell to the Los Angeles Clippers thanks to a career-high 55 points from Kawhi Leonard, and lost to the Utah Jazz on a go-ahead bucket from Keyonte George in the game before that.\n\nWith the Lakers missing several key players, the Pistons have the edge to snap the short losing streak before it gets out of hand.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham is averaging 26.5 points per game this season, and he's hit the Over on this scoring line in 15 of 29 games, including two straight. He's scored 26+ in 10 of 17 games on the road, and he's reached that mark in four of his last six outside of Little Caesars Arena.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham Over 25.5 points\n\nSpread: Pistons -2.5 (-110) | Lakers +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Pistons -140 | Lakers +120\n\nOver/Under: Over 232 (-110) | Under 232 (-110)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have hit the Game Total Over in 34 of their last 55 games (+10.90 Units / 18% ROI).

Most expected that the Celtics' 2025-26 season would be flushed down the drain too, as Boston awaited their All-NBA forward to return.\n\nBut after 31 games this season, the Celtics are third in the Eastern Conference with a 19-12 record. It is a development that few outside of Boston's locker room saw coming, especially after the Celtics began this season 0-3.\n\nMORE: Jaylen Brown just tied Larry Bird's all-time Celtics record with insane points streak\n\nWhile Tatum has been out, Jaylen Brown has stepped up to play some of the best basketball of his career.\n\nIn year 10, Brown is averaging 29.7 points per game while shooting better than 50 percent from the floor for the first time. Not only is he a lock to make his fifth All-Star team, but Jeff Teague suspects that the quality of Brown's performances will earn him his first All-NBA nod at the end of the season.\n\nOn the Club 520 podcast, Teague argued that Brown has a better first-team All-NBA case than Luka Doncic, the NBA's leading scorer at 33.7 points per game. The former All-Star argued that Doncic is playing on a superior roster with the Los Angeles Lakers relative to who has been surrounding Brown in Boston.\n\n\"They have nothing over there (in Boston),\" Teague said. \"The Celtics were supposed to be a--, bro. I'd give it to him over Luka.\"\n\nJeff Teague says Jaylen Brown Deserves to be first team all NBA over Luka\n\n“He deserves to be 1st team not gonna lie… They have nothing over there.

    "description": "The latest 2026 NBA Championship odds and analysis, with the Oklahoma City Thunder (+135) drawing the shortest odds to win it all.",
    "fullText": "It's amazing what a 27-5 start can do for the perception of a team.\n\nThe conversation around the Oklahoma City Thunder has shifted over the past few weeks from whether OKC is the best team in the NBA to whether they may just be the best team of all time.\n\nThere's no arguing the fact that the Thunder's 14.2 net rating is the best in modern history, and the defending champs have as much skill, depth, and defensive grit as any dynastic team in recent memory. It's no wonder then that their +135 odds to win the NBA Championship are far and away the shortest in the Association.\n\nLet's dive into the latest odds as the Thunder continue to separate themselves from the rest of the pack.\n\nHere's a visual representation of how the NBA championship has odds evolved since June 2025.\n\nHighest ticket percentage\n•    Nuggets 8.8%\n•    Thunder 8.7%\n•    Mavericks 8.2%\n\nHighest handle percentage\n•    Thunder 17.9%\n•    Mavericks 16.3%\n•    Lakers 13.3%\n\nBiggest liability\n•    Mavericks \n•    Lakers\n•    Warriors\n\nWe turned to the enormous computing power of ChatGPT to find out who the large language model believes will be the last team standing this season. Not surprisingly, it stuck with the defending champs.\n\nOklahoma City has the cleanest runway to be the best team in 2026: an MVP-caliber engine in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander entering the heart of his prime, a two-way star wing in Jalen Williams, and a 7-footer in Chet Holmgren whose blend of rim protection, spacing, and feel supercharges modern schemes. That trio already drives elite half-court efficiency and a top-tier defense, and it’s backed by organizational continuity that reliably turns role players into playoff-useful pieces. By 2026, Holmgren’s strength and timing should be fully NBA-hardened, unlocking more switching and fewer help-and-recover compromises, while SGA’s mid-range and foul-drawing remain matchup-proof in May and June.\n\nDepth and optionality push the Thunder over the top. They can win big or small, play five-out without sacrificing rim protection, and toggle between pressure defense and conservative coverages depending on opponent. Crucially, they still have surplus picks and cap flexibility to plug the inevitable holes that show up in a long postseason, whether that’s a second unit scorer, another stretch big, or a specialist wing.\n\nExpect a rotation stacked with plus length, shooting, and decision-making around the core; enough to outlast the West’s heavyweights and finish the job in the Finals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Hornets coach Charles Lee is excited about Tidjane Salaun's recent development originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTidjane Salaun has not been the most popular player on the Charlotte Hornets roster since he was selected sixth overall in the 2024 NBA Draft. Considering he was chosen with such a high pick, many people expected him to be a star-level talent.\n\nUnfortunately for the Hornets and their fans, Salaun might not pan out as the star player they were expecting. However, he is working hard to become a productive contributor to Charles Lee's system with the Hornets.\n\nConsidering Salaun is only in his second NBA season, he has a lot of room to grow. He is only 20, so his development is still pending. Most players' development is not linear, so these recent performances might be a good sign for the Hornets moving forward.\n\nCoach Lee would love to see Salaun further improve because he is a big believer in the 20-year-old Frenchman. After an underwhelming rookie year, Salaun is playing fewer minutes this season, but he has been more efficient.\n\nMore: Hornets' Kon Knueppel ruled out against Magic with ankle injury\n\nThe 20-year-old is averaging 7.1 points on 51.1% from the field and 45.7% from three. Salaun has accepted his role, and he is doing his best to be as productive as possible. Coach Lee is pleased to see this because he sees solid potential with Salaun.\n\n\"He's totally embraced his role. He just realizes how much he can impact the game on both ends of the floor without just scoring, and that's what we're seeing. We're seeing more of a well-rounded game from him, where he's rebounding defensively and guarding multiple different guys,\" Lee said after winning on Friday.\n\n\"Offensively, that play where he had an opportunity to shoot an off-the-dribble step-back three, which he has in the past, and to make the one-more pass was very encouraging to see. It just shows how much he's about team, trying to compete, and do everything he can to impact winning.\"\n\nAgainst the Orlando Magic, Salaun had a superb game, posting 14 points on 6-7 shooting from the field while grabbing nine rebounds. It was an impressive performance that could lead to some consistency in the long run.\n\nAs long as Salaun is playing this way, one can expect that the Hornets will have a reliable wing moving forward. It will be a lengthy journey, but Salaun is only 20, so he has plenty of time to develop.\n\nHornets' LaMelo Ball held back after hard foul against Wizards\n\nCharlotte Hornets sign former Clemson star PJ Hall\n\nLuke Kornet found success by letting go: Inside Spurs big man's evolution away from 3-point specialist\n\nNBA trade rumors: Ranking 9 most likely stars to be traded, from Giannis Antetokounmpo to Anthony Davis\n\nAce Bailey injury update is bad news for Jazz rookie",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are in absolutely putrid shape as of right now. They are 4-6 in the month of December and just got the brakes beaten off of them by the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day.\n\nFollowing the loss due to the same factors that have plagued this group for a month, JJ Redick ripped the team in their postgame press conference.\n\nMore: Lakers coach JJ Redick shreds team after Rockets loss\n\nRedick stated that there are too many players on the current roster who just don't care. If you look at the teams' performances as of late, Redick is not wrong.\n\nIf this team wants to not waste a single year of Luka Dončić's prime, changes need to be made and fast because, as presently constructed, this is not a championship-caliber roster.\n\nNBA insider Kevin O'Connor reported after the game that changes to the roster could be right on the horizon in LA.\n\nAfter the Rockets blew out the Lakers at home, Kevin O'Connor got on Twitter/X and laid out exactly what the plan is in LA after their abysmal showing through the month of December.\n\nTrades are coming in Los Angeles. Just a matter of who and when. Without them, this team has no chance of winning a title this year. That much is obvious after watching the Lakers as of late and listening to what JJ Redick said postgame.\n\n— Kevin O'Connor (@KevinOConnor) December 26, 2025\n\nThis leads you to think, if trades are incoming, who's on the way out the door?\n\nThere are many players on the roster not carrying their weight. Players that come to mind would quickly be players like Rui Hachimura, Jake LaRavia, Dalton Knecht, Maxi Kleber, and Gabe Vincent.\n\nAll of those players combined take up just north of $50 million in cap space. That is far too much money to go towards what is now essentially dead weight.\n\nWhile the Lakers don't have anywhere near the assets a team like OKC does, they are not without them completely. Between a mix of all those players' tradeable salaries and the picks the Lakers have to give, we could definitely see a move soon.\n\nDon't be shocked to see any or all of those players gone within the next month, as the Lakers have to take a real look in the mirror prior to the deadline.\n\nThe only issue for Los Angeles: teams know they're desperate, and as everyone knows, there's always going to be a Laker tax. We'll see if and how the team is able to improve its roster before the trade deadline.\n\nReport: Lakers 'circling back' on Heat's Andrew Wiggins\n\nWhat's behind the NBA's best bromance between Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves?\n\nLakers' Luka Doncic says he grew up idolizing this NBA legend\n\nLakers' LeBron James had alarming stat in Rockets loss",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers’ losing streak continued with an NBA Christmas Day slate loss against the Houston Rockets.\n\nWith an opportunity to prove they are one of the top contenders in the Western Conference on the primetime stage, the Lakers fell flat. Shortly after the game wrapped up, the outspoken former NBA veteran Kendrick Perkins offered the Lakers a piece of his mind.\n\n“Again, the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka,” Perkins wrote on social media.\n\n“He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.”\n\nAgain the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka. He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.\n\n— Kendrick Perkins (@KendrickPerkins) December 26, 2025\n\nDoncic checked in for 34 minutes of action on Thursday night. He went 9-17 from the field and attempted seven shots from the charity stripe. Doncic scored a game-high of 25 points, while coming down with five rebounds, and producing seven assists.\n\nHe also turned the ball over six times, more than any other player involved, and finished the game as a minus-25.\n\nThe Lakers were blown out with a score of 119-96. With that loss, they dropped to three straight defeats. Now, the Lakers are 19-10 on the year, slipping to fifth in the Western Conference standings. The victory for Houston allowed the Rockets to pull within half a game of the Lakers.\n\nDoncic and the Lakers aren’t in panic mode, but it’s clear that the coaching staff is growing frustrated with the team’s lack of execution, especially on the defensive end. It’s something that JJ Redick shined a light on earlier this week after the Lakers lost to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn Thursday night, Redick surely didn’t hold back. After Doncic and the Lakers get a day off on Friday, they’ll be back on the practice court for what Redick describes as an “uncomfortable” practice and film session. The Lakers will get a chance to bounce back against the struggling Sacramento Kings on Sunday.\n\nBetween the public pressure from analysts such as Perkins—and the brutally honest assessment from Redick—Doncic and the Lakers have a lot riding on them over the next couple of days. A comfortable win over the Kings could help them get back on the right track. Soon, the hoops world will see how the Lakers respond.",

Kuminga, who's seen a diminished role with the Warriors this season, would get a fresh start.\n\n\"Perhaps more importantly, the team gains necessary closure on the drawn-out Jonathan Kuminga saga, which left him a restricted free agent for most of the summer and currently has the 23-year-old forward out of coach Steve Kerr's rotation.\"\n\nThe eight-team deal would be the largest trade in NBA history, passing the Houston Rockets' trade for Kevin Durant last summer.\n\nSteph's quote about Klay will bring a tear to Warriors fans\n\nJoe Mazzulla wants to get a pet wolf\n\nSteven Adams has the craziest eating habits in the NBA\n\nAnthony Edwards had an \"I'm him\" moment vs. Thunder\n\nWe finally know how Michael Jordan really feels about Scottie Pippen\n\nCooper Flagg's clutch stats are unprecedented",

    "fullText": "Anfernee Simons’ future with the Boston Celtics has been a subplot to the opening months of the 2025-26 NBA season. The score-first guard was acquired in the deal that sent Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers during the summer. Simons is in the final year of his four-year $100 million deal.\n\nIf the Celtics choose to make a move close to the Feb. 5 trade deadline, the team views Simons as a logical trade chip. After all, it is better to flip him in return for long-term assets, rather than risk losing him for nothing in the summer.\n\nHowever, if Simons does stay in Boston beyond the trade deadline, ESPN’s Tim Bontemps, speaking on a recent episode of ESPN’s ‘The Hoop Collective’ podcast, is not convinced he will have a significant role once the postseason begins.\n\n“Frankly, I don’t think Anfernee Simons is going to have a very big role in the playoffs either way,” Bontemps said. “They’re going to be playing Derrick White and Payton Pritchard a ton of minutes. He’s (Simons) not at all a good defensive player. I think he’ll be a liability in large part in the playoffs anyway.”\n\nSimons has become an important part of Boston’s bench rotation. In 29 games this season, all from the bench, he’s averaging 13 points, 2.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists, shooting 43.1% from the field and 36.9% from deep. However, according to DunksandThrees, he’s still struggling on the defensive end, ranking in the bottom 10th percentile of guards for Defensive Estimated Plus/Minus.\n\nBrad Stevens and the Celtics’ front office will likely explore potential trades as the deadline approaches. It’s fair to assume that Simons will feature in those discussions, if for no other reason than to perform some due diligence on his potential market.\n\nThe problem Boston will face is that trading Simons will leave it short on depth at the guard position. As such, if Simons is moved, multiple additional moves could follow to ensure there’s enough balance within the roster ahead of the postseason.\n\nNBA Analyst Weighs In on Jayson Tatum’s Potential Return",

And among the very best players in the league comes a platform that lets them do some equally impressive things off the court as well.

While some of them may have nailed the task at hand, others quickly descended into unintentional comedy given their skill gaps at this particular non-basketball task.\n\nThe folks behind the official \"Boston Celtics\" YouTube channel put together a clip of those efforts to enjoy those gift wrapping efforts for us to enjoy.

    "description": "With Denver potentially shorthanded by as many as three starters, the Timberwolves have a strong path to covering the spread in the Mile High City.",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Timberwolves head to the Mile High City for a Christmas night showdown with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nAfter dominating the series in recent years, the Timberwolves saw their six-game winning streak over the Nuggets snapped earlier this season.\n\nDenver will likely be without three starters, which is a big reason my Timberwolves vs. Nuggets predictions and NBA picks include a road cover on Thursday, December 25.\n\nTimberwolves vs Nuggets best bet: Timberwolves +3.5 (-110)\n\nThe Denver Nuggets knew they'd be down two starters. Neither Christian Braun (ankle) nor Aaron Gordon (hamstring) has played at all in December.\n\nGordon scored a total of 32 points in Denver's two previous wins over Minnesota this season. Braun only played in one, scoring seven.\n\nThe surprise was shooter Cameron Johnson, who went down with an apparent knee injury against Dallas in the last game. He was scheduled for a Christmas Eve MRI, but limped immediately afterward and is day-to-day for the game.\n\nThe Nuggets' depth has helped Denver flip the series against Minnesota. After losing six straight to the T-Wolves, 1-5 ATS, heading into the season, the Nuggets won and covered both games this year.\n\nHowever, with three of the six double-figure scorers potentially unavailable due to the team surrounding Nikola Jokic, that depth will be depleted in the holiday rematch.\n\nDenver is 1-2, straight up and ATS, since its six-game winning streak ended. The hot stretch was a bit of fool's gold, since it included just two winning teams and opponents with a combined .404 winning percentage.\n\nThe Nuggets have also lost to 12-19 Dallas twice in the last 10 games.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have pulled within a game and a half of Denver, riding a three-game winning streak and a 5-1 ATS run. The T-Wolves have covered their last three as underdogs, dating back to before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe game total seems high given that both teams rank in the lower half of the league in pace. Minnesota has gone Under in five straight and seven of the last nine, all against significantly lower game total cutoffs.\n\nDenver has been Under the game total in two of the last three and has played a long string of faster-paced teams, with 10 of the previous 14 games coming against teams ranked in the top half of the NBA's tempo rankings.\n\nIf Cameron Johnson doesn't play, Denver will be down an outside threat, which would seem to make it easier to team up on Jokic, but his assists actually have gone up when a shooting threat is out.\n\nJokic had 11 dimes against Minnesota in a game Johnson missed earlier this year and had 14 against Indiana when Jamal Murray was out.\n\nGuarding Jokic is a big job, and as one of the league's most-honored defenders, Rudy Gobert will take on a large portion of that job. That means paying less attention and expending less energy at the other end of the floor.\n\nGobert has scored a total of 12 points and taken a total of 10 shots in the first two games against Denver this season.\n\nSpread: Timberwolves +4.5 (-110) | Nuggets -4.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Timberwolves +155 | Nuggets -190\n\nOver/Under: Over 230.5 (-110) | Under 230.5 (-110)\n\nThe Denver Nuggets have hit the Game Total Over in 57 of their last 97 games (+13.03 Units / 12% ROI).

    "description": "The NBA's Christmas Day schedule is STACKED this year. Here's how you should prioritize watching each game.",
    "fullText": "There are few more delightful American traditions than the NBA's marquee Christmas Day slate. With no due respect to the brazen, oversaturated NFL — which has an abysmal Christmas schedule — the 25th of December will always belong to the Association and its biggest stars and best teams. It's just that much more special.\n\nWell, to be clear, Christmas with the NBA is actually special, for one.\n\nThis year, it sure seems like we're in for some Christmas barnburners. A three-time MVP takes on one of the NBA's bright, young superstars in the latest chapter of a wonderful rivalry in Denver. Two legends reunite with a holiday background in the Bay Area. Another MVP squares off against the possible future of the sport in Oklahoma City. Two star-laden teams try to see who's more worthy of the hype in Southern California. And a potential elite shotmaking battle could be in store at Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut not all of these matchups were created equal. Let's rank all five NBA Christmas games this year and determine which ones are worth at least slightly paying attention to, which ones are worth ignoring your family, and which ones you can probably ignore entirely. Note: All games will be available to watch on ESPN and ABC.\n\nIs it real hoops? Unfortunately, no.\n\nI get the intrigue of watching former longtime teammates, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, pitted against one another. I also think that a potential generational rookie like Cooper Flagg deserves the big Christmas stage. He'll make the most of it. But when we boil this game down, it features two of the Western Conference's more middling teams. It might be fun for a little while, like at the very start, but otherwise, expect some pretty forgettable basketball here. I don't think it's worth your time on a holiday.\n\nIs it real hoops? Uh ... maybe.\n\nBefore the season, the Cavaliers and Knicks looked like the clear top two teams in the East. A matchup in the Eastern Conference Finals seemed inevitable. The Knicks have held up their end of the bargain. The Cavaliers, who have already almost lost as many games this year as they did during all of last season's regular season, have not.\n\nWith that said, Donovan Mitchell and Jalen Brunson could make for some electric shotmaking in the clutch on both ends. This one is at least worth keeping on in the background at home to monitor.\n\nIs it real hoops? Yes, let's roll with it.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I think Alperen Şengün's and Kevin Durant's Rockets have a markedly higher ceiling as a legit NBA title contender. But it's hard to deny the Lakers' sheer star power, with Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves, and LeBron James. I don't think the Lakers can hang with the Rockets in a seven-game playoff series. I do, however, think they can push them in a potential Christmas classic that features so much talent on both ends of the floor.\n\nIs it real hoops? Oh goodness, YES. Absolutely, YES.\n\nWith two heated playoff meetings and seemingly countless down-to-the-wire regular-season meetings over the last three years, the Nuggets and Timberwolves have a legit case as the NBA's best active rivalry. It is, more often than not, what elite basketball should be all about. There is nothing like watching Nikola Jokić and Anthony Edwards trade shot after shot in a physical game between two squads who hate and respect each other so much at the same time.\n\nThis rivalry game concludes the NBA's Christmas Day slate this year. It will likely be the perfect dessert.\n\nIs it real hoops? Dearest readers, YES.\n\nI don't think the Thunder and Spurs have enough established history to consider them a real rivalry yet, but hoo boy, are they getting there. Victor Wembanyama has already made his displeasure with the Thunder well-known. Plus, his Spurs are one of the few teams to actually knock off juggernaut Oklahoma City so far this season. Expect a well-coached and disciplined game from both teams. Expect a few trademark, ridiculous sequences courtesy of Wembanyama, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and others.\n\nAnd expect a worthy early entry to what will likely eventually become the NBA's best rivalry down the line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Best NBA Christmas 2025 games to watch this year, ranked",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are one of the better teams in the Western Conference and boast a 19-9 Record following their loss to the Phoenix Suns. However, the team could use an additional boost to strengthen its roster.\n\nFanSided's Josh Cornellisen has proposed a blockbuster trade between the Lakers, Clippers, and the Brooklyn Nets that would pair Kawhi Leonard with Luka Doncic and LeBron James.\n\nClippers receive: Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, Gabe Vincent, 2030 first-round pick swap (LAL)\n\nNets receive: Maxi Kleber, Dalton Knecht, 2032 Lakers second-round pick.\n\nSeveral superstars could be on the move, notably Anthony Davis and Giannis Antetokounmpo. However, it's not hard to see the Clippers moving on from Leonard if things continue to get worse.  The Clippers are currently one of the worst teams in the Western Conference, with a record of 8-22 on the season.\n\nThe Clippers could opt out of the Leonard contract, which has three years remaining and is worth $149 million, sending him to a Lakers team looking to compete for a top spot in the Western Conference by adding Leonard, giving them another dynamic scorer to pair with James and Doncic.\n\nParting ways with Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, and Gabe Vincent, along with the Lakers' first-round pick swap, sending them to the Clippers, helping them kick off a rebuild.\n\nDespite injuries throughout his career, Leonard has shown he can still play at a high level. Adding him to a Lakers team that currently has the worst defense in the NBA would make them a more complete and competitive squad.\n\nThe Lakers are rolling out a potential lineup that includes Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, and LeBron James, giving them one of the most versatile starting lineups in basketball.",

    "description": "The Grizzlies beat the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night, hanging on to the 9th spot in the Western Conference.",
    "fullText": "The Memphis Grizzlies beat the Utah Jazz, 137-128, on Tuesday night to improve to 14-16 on the season. That gave them a teeny, tiny boost in the fight for play-in positioning in the Western Conference.\n\nI guess that’s some sort of an accomplishment.\n\nFrankly, it was hard to watch this game and decide what was worse — the tanking Jazz team whose defense helped to make Santi Aldama look like a world beater (the Wizards also did this the other night, so that’s the kind of company the Jazz are in), or the Grizzlies team that was so recently considered to be on their way to perennial title contention, barely fighting for the ninth seed.\n\nIt’s not wild to imagine that if the Jazz were fielding a roster meant to win, playing only their best players on a regular basis and if Walker Kessler wasn’t recovering from shoulder surgery, they could probably give a team like the Grizzlies a run for their money for a play-in spot (is that something to be proud of?). They might even be better than this version of the Grizzlies.\n\nBut the Jazz aren’t serious about getting wins, and they’re still playing the Grizzlies pretty close (and the Jazz beat the Grizzlies in Memphis on Dec. 12).\n\nRemember when this Grizzlies team was one of the bright-future, must-watch teams of the NBA? It really wasn’t that long ago. They were the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference for two straight seasons in 2021-22 and 2022-23. That’s like yesterday in NBA years.\n\nThey were widely regarded as one of the NBA’s most fun teams to watch and then it all came crashing down. Watching the Memphis Grizzlies is a reminder of the fragility of the NBA and how the margins for error are so thin.\n\nKyle Anderson, now a Jazz man, was one of the really important supporting cast members on that Memphis team. And he, like so many others wonders where things went wrong.\n\n“Yeah, I’m with you, kind of wondering what’s going on over there,” Anderson told the Deseret News. “My opinion of it is that front office walked into something really good, and put together a really good team at first. We were rolling. Then they kind of wanted to go in their own direction and bring in young guys that kind of fit more what they wanted to do. I think that’s where they got mixed up and lost in the sauce.”\n\nAnd then so many other things happened. Most notably, Ja Morant’s off-court shenanigans. The point, though, is that every decision from every person on an NBA team has to come together in the perfect way to even get close to being able to compete for a title.\n\nIt takes so many things to go right for a team to be great. There needs to be talent, buy-in, good coaching, tenacity, freedom from distractions. And any small crack in the foundation can have catastrophic consequences. Because on NBA teams, one small crack often spreads and splinters and leads to more and more dysfunction.\n\nAnd the Grizzlies have gone through just about all of it — front office decisions changing the chemistry of the team, tensions between players and coaches, off-court behavior impacting availability of stars (time and time again), fractures in relationships, deals that have split up a once-hungry and competitive nucleus, injuries, coaching turnover, etc., etc.\n\nThere’s probably a number of teams that don’t think they are susceptible to these things happening to them, but it takes just one disgruntled star, one player being around the wrong people, one person getting bad advice, one person making a bad decision.\n\nI guess when considering all of these things, it’s the Grizzlies who were the most disappointing to watch on Tuesday night — thinking of what could have been. Instead, there was Morant, in street clothes, yet again injured, watching his team from the sideline, knowing that even if they make it to the play-in tournament, that would mean being destined for the Oklahoma City Thunder swiftly sweeping them in the first round.\n\nTonight they beat the Jazz. But that’s not much to be proud of.",

I'm not trying to be vague. I feel strongly about it, but we want to be mindful also of the NBA (Injury) Report and all the things we have to do to be aboveboard there and make sure he's in a good place.”\n\nSan Antonio enters the matchup against Oklahoma City on a six-game winning streak, including a 111-109 victory over the Thunder on Dec. 11 in the NBA Cup semifinals.\n\nWembanyama has played in five straight games, including the NBA Cup Final on Dec. 16, since missing 12 straight games with a left calf strain. San Antonio's 124-113 loss to the New York Knicks for the NBA Cup title does not count in the standings or statistics.\n\nWembanyama was downgraded to questionable on Monday by the Spurs as a precaution.\n\n“Every day there is a question of preventative because he's not too far removed from an injury,\" Johnson said. \"We have to be so mindful of that kid's future and bigger picture. And, we've had a lot of travel. He's had life going on and we're just trying to make sure that we have his best interest at heart regardless of winning streak and excitement and whatever else we are feeling at the time.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA,",
