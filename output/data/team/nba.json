    "fullText": "LeBron James becomes the oldest NBA player in history to get a triple-double originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLeBron James has always been one of the most impressive players in NBA history. In his younger years, he was always setting records for being the youngest player to do something.\n\nNow that he is 23 years into his NBA career, he is setting records for being the oldest player to do something. On Thursday, James had a triple-double for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Dallas Mavericks, marking another record for the 41-year-old.\n\nNow that he is 41 years old, LeBron continues to be one of the most impressive athletes out there. Most NBA players have retired by this point, but he is still going strong for the Lakers.\n\nHe is not only playing, but he is playing well on a good team. That is just a testament to how well James has taken care of his body over the years, and his natural talent being higher than almost everyone else.\n\nMORE: Lakers' LeBron James ends NBA record streak that is unlikely to be matched any time soon\n\nAgainst the Mavericks, James had a triple-double with his 28 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists. He almost did not get his 10th rebound because Austin Reaves was fighting him for boards.\n\nHead coach JJ Redick was pleased to see James get another achievement, as he is always proud to be his head coach at the tail-end of his career.\n\n\"I don't take for granted how good he is. I recognize that on a daily basis. The more remarkable thing is how much he cares in his 23rd year with all his accomplishments. He's got a 23-year prime basically,\" Redick said after the win against Dallas.\n\nNow, James is the oldest player to get a triple-double at 41. That is possibly one of the toughest records to ever beat because most players struggle to perform in their mid-30s.\n\nHowever, LeBron continues to stand out even if he is in his record-setting 23rd season. James seems ready to play more seasons, which is proof of his all-time greatness.\n\nHow Olympics allowed Lakers to load manage injuries for LeBron James, Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, Marcus Smart\n\nHow were Shaq, Duncan, Hakeem different as leaders?

    "description": "On Thursday, the NBA announced just 30 minutes before the Utah Jazz’s home game against the Portland Trail Blazers that it was fining the Jazz $500,000 for “conduct detrimental to the league.”  The statement specifically noted games against the Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat in which Utah sat Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson Jr. in the fourth quarters.  The Jazz lost to Orlando, but beat Miami.",
    "fullText": "On Thursday, the NBA announced just 30 minutes before the Utah Jazz’s home game against the Portland Trail Blazers that it was fining the Jazz $500,000 for “conduct detrimental to the league.”\n\nThe statement specifically noted games against the Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat in which Utah sat Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson Jr. in the fourth quarters. The Jazz lost to Orlando, but beat Miami.\n\nThe NBA implemented the Player Participation Policy at the start of the 2023-24 season. The policy lays out rules for teams regarding participation of the league’s star players, which is defined as any player named to an All-NBA team or named an NBA All-Star in any of the previous three seasons.\n\nMarkkanen and Jackson are the only players on the Jazz for whom that definition applies to.\n\nOne rule in the policy states, “Teams must refrain from any long-term shutdown (or near shutdown) whereby a star player ceases participating in games or begins to play a materially reduced role in circumstances affecting the integrity of the game.”\n\nThe Jazz won’t have to worry about Jackson’s minutes moving forward this season, as the team announced Thursday that he will likely be out for the remainder of the season due to a knee surgery to remove a benign tumor.\n\nUtah head coach Will Hardy said he sat Markkanen against the Magic and Heat because Markkanen was on a minutes restriction, and Hardy said he’d continue to do so if instructed by the medical team.\n\n“So if our medical team puts a minutes restriction on Lauri, I’ll try to keep Lauri healthy,” Hardy said.\n\nThe Jazz were again without any of their star players in Thursday’s 135-119 loss to the Trail Blazers, as Keyonte George also continued to sit out due to an ankle sprain he sustained against the Magic.\n\nPortland was without All-Star Deni Avdija.\n\nThe Jazz played tight and went into halftime with a 63-61 lead but fell apart in the third quarter as it’s done numerous times this year.\n\nThe Trail Blazers outscored Utah 40-23 in the third.\n\n“The game got away from us in the third quarter, mostly because of fouling,” Hardy said. “They shot 16 free throws in the quarter. When that happens, it’s also hard to get into a rhythm offensively because you’re playing against a set defense for most of the time.”\n\nUtah did see some life in the fourth, especially from Svi Mykhailiuk. The veteran was out of the rotation for three straight games but came into Thursday’s contest and scored 14 points in just 17 minutes.\n\nHe shot 4 of 5 from behind the 3-point line and the Jazz opened the quarter outscoring Portland 22-10.\n\n“Svi’s been the ultimate pro his entire time with us,” Hardy said. “There are times that he’s in the rotation, there’s times he’s been a starter, there’s times he’s been out of the rotation and he always handles himself with a ton of class.”\n\nDespite the Jazz clawing back from a 15-point deficit, Portland ran away with it.\n\nBrice Sensabaugh led the Jazz with 28 points, while Kyle Filipowski, Isaiah Collier and Ace Bailey all added 15 points.\n\nUtah’s new two-way player, Blake Hinson, also saw his first minutes in Thursday’s loss and scored 11 points on 4 of 7 shooting in his debut.",

    "fullText": "It’s been a great season for the Boston Celtics, including Jaylen Brown.\n\nThe Celtics head into the NBA All-Star Break with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference at 35-19. They also rank second in the NBA in points per game allowed, second in offensive rating and third in net rating.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown is having a fantastic season in Jayson Tatum’s absence. He’s emerged as an MVP candidate amid the best year of his career and will start the NBA All-Star Game on Sunday.\n\nBoston is surging, too, winning six of its last seven games after blowing out the Chicago Bulls at home on Wednesday night. After ending the first half on a high note, Brown is proud of what the team has accomplished so far and is excited to see what it can do in the second half.\n\n“I’m proud of this group and staff/ office looking forward to 2nd half go Cs,” Brown posted on his X account on Thursday night, accompanied by a graphic comparing the Celtics’ performance at the All-Star Break this year compared to last year.\n\nI’m proud of this group and staff/ office looking forward to 2nd half go Cs ☘️ pic.twitter.com/I0cqxQTPYg\n\n— Jaylen Brown (@FCHWPO) February 13, 2026\n\nShockingly, the numbers are eerily similar despite Boston’s major roster turnover since then. The Celtics are a totally different team now after losing Kristaps Porzingis, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford and Luke Kornet over the offseason, not to mention Tatum to injury.\n\nAnd yet, Boston is still second in the East and third in net rating at the break, just like last year.\n\nThe Celtics’ remarkable consistency is due to several factors, including Brown’s stellar year, his teammates stepping up and Joe Mazzulla’s terrific coaching. Boston has persevered in the face of adversity this season, bringing the energy and intensity every night and usually finding a way to win.\n\nThe Celtics rebound well, shoot a lot of 3-pointers, play hard on defense and take care of the basketball. That’s been a recipe for success this season, and it may be even more effective after the All-Star Break if Tatum returns soon.\n\nWhen Is Celtics’ Next Game? Date, Time, How To Watch Boston’s Return After All-Star Break",

    "fullText": "NBA insider makes blunt Lakers prediction after LeBron James’ comments originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLeBron James set the NBA world off this week after making a blunt comment about comparisons between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n“You want me to compare us to them? That’s a championship team right there. We’re not. We can’t sustain energy and effort for 48 minutes, and they can. That’s why they won a championship,” James said after a convincing defeat against the champs.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Tim McMahon, James was described as “in a mood” and “grumpy” after the Tuesday night loss.\n\nCould he have a change of heart with a change of mood? Sure. But McMahon doesn’t seem to be buying it. The NBA insider claimed that James’ statement was a fact. The Lakers are good—but not championship good.\n\n“The Lakers got bounced in the first round last year and probably are getting bounced in the first round this year. They’re not close to a championship team. Sweet—10 games of improved defense—but they’re a bad defensive team.”\n\nYou could certainly consider a first-round exit for the Luka-LeBron Lakers a massive failure this season.\n\nIt would be a stunner to see the Lakers fall out of the playoff picture. They are going to enter the All-Star break as a top-six team in the Western Conference, but they aren’t too far out of the NBA Play-In Tournament.\n\nThe tournament doesn’t guarantee a miss, but it definitely doesn’t guarantee a ticket to the postseason either. The Lakers need to show a lot of improvement in the coming months.\n\nAccording to Basketball Reference’s playoff probability report, the Lakers have a 79 percent chance of cracking the playoffs this season. That’s the seventh-best in the West.\n\nIf the season ended at the break, the Lakers would draw a first-round series against the Denver Nuggets. In one meeting this year, the Lakers defeated the Nuggets, who were missing Nikola Jokic. Denver holds a 35-20 record and is widely viewed as a championship contender in the Western Conference.\n\nAt the end of the day, predictions and probabilities are just a guess. The Lakers haven’t exceeded expectations so far, but there is plenty of basketball left to be played.\n\nJose Alvarado posts stat line never done before in NBA history\n\nIs LeBron James playing vs. Mavericks tonight?\n\nJazz reportedly accused of tanking amid Jaren Jackson Jr. injury as NBA's Adam Silver put on notice\n\nRich Paul dives into why he thinks Heat president Pat Riley is not a fan of today's NBA\n\nIs Cooper Flagg playing tonight vs. Lakers?

    "description": "This year, the NBA All-Star Game will have a new USA vs. World format.",
    "fullText": "The timing could not have been more perfect.\n\nWhile on the other side of the globe some of the world's best athletes in their sports represent their countries at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, this year the best of the NBA will take on that international format:\n\nThe pride in representing your country could bring the most competitive All-Star Games we have seen in years. Remember, each of the last seven MVP awards have been won by players born outside the USA — and they are coming to compete.\n\n\"I'm never stepping onto the court to lose, you know, or not caring,\" said the Spurs Victor Wembanyama, who was voted a World starter by the fans. \"Just like at home, I'm never stepping into a board game, not caring or thinking I'm gonna lose, or I'm thinking it's okay to lose.\n\n\"So I'll be out there, might as well win.\"\n\nHere's all you need to know about the 2026 NBA All-Star Game and how not to miss a moment of the action/\n\nWhere: Intuit Dome, Inglewood, CA\n\nThis year, the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock — and it falls right in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format, a USA vs. World showdown that fans and players have been asking for.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players have been divided into three teams, two USA teams — USA Stripes and USA Stars — and one World Team. Those three teams will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games, each team playing at least two games.\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title. (If there is a tie, it comes down to point differential.)\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 5 p.m. Eastern, an earlier time than in previous years, leading into more coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nThere are two USA teams — Stars and Stripes — and one World team. Fans voted for five starters from each of the Western and Eastern Conferences, and the NBA coaches voted in the 14 reserve players (plus NBA Commissioner Adam Silver added one more USA player to balance the rosters, and also picked the injury replacements). The league divided up the teams.\n\n• Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee/Greece)\n• Luka Doncic (Los Angeles Lakers/Slovenia)\n• Nikola Jokic (Denver/Serbia)\n• Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio/France)\n• Karl-Anthony Towns (New York/Dominican Rep.)\n• Pascal Siakam (Indiana/Cameroon)\n• Deni Avdija (Portland/Israel)\n• Jamal Murray (Denver/Canada)\n• Alperen Sengun (Houston/Turkiye)\nCoach: Toronto's Darko Rajakovic (Serbia)\n\n• Cade Cunningham (Detroit)\n• Tyrese Maxey (Philadelphia)\n• Anthony Edwards (Minnesota)\n• Chet Holmgren (Oklahoma City)\n• Jalen Duren (Detroit)\n• Devin Booker (Phoenix)\n• Scottie Barnes (Toronto)\n• Jalen Johnson (Atlanta)\nCoach: Detroit's J.B. Bickerstaff\n\n• Jalen Brunson (New York)\n• Jaylen Brown (Boston)\n• LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers)\n• Kevin Durant (Houston)\n• Donovan Mitchell (Cleveland)\n• Kawhi Leonard (LA Clippers)\n• Norman Powell (Miami)\n• Brandon Ingram (Toronto)\nCoach: San Antonio's Mitch Johnson\n\n• Stephen Curry (Golden State)\n• Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City/Canada)\n• Both Luka Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo have missed games this week with injuries, but neither has been officially ruled out yet. The World team currently has nine players; if one drops out, there will be no need for Adam Silver to name a replacement.\n\nRising Stars G1: Team Melo vs. Team Austin - 9:00 PM ET\n\nRising Stars G2: Team Vince vs. Team T-Mac - 9:55 PM ET\n\nCastrol Rising Stars Championship - 10:35 PM ET\n\nNBA HBCU Classic Presented by AT&T - 11:00 PM ET\n\nState Farm 3-Point Contest - First Event - 5:00 PM ET\n\nEvery moment of All-Star Weekend — the Rising Stars challenge on Friday.

    "fullText": "The James Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is a step closer to adding to its esteemed roster of myriad basketball legends.\n\nOn Wednesday, three-time WNBA champion Candace Parker, Team USA’s 1996 women’s national team, Elena Delle Donne and Chamique Holdsclaw were among the premier names announced as finalists for the hoops hall, which will soon welcome many of the biggest names in the history of women’s basketball. Former NBA All-Stars Blake Griffin and Amar’e Stoudemire will also be finalists, with Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers also closer to the Hall.\n\nParker, a two-time WNBA MVP, will forever remain a pre-eminent part of influencing women’s hoops. In 2008, after an esteemed career at the University of Tennessee, she immediately broke through in the pros by becoming the first (and only) player in league history to win MVP and Rookie of the Year honors. Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld are the only NBA players to do so. Parker, whose 16-year career ended in 2023, is ranked 10th in WNBA history in total points, third in rebounds, 11th in assists, fifth in blocks and 18th in career steals. She was named WNBA Finals MVP in 2016 after leading the Los Angeles Sparks to their fourth title in team history. In 2021, she led her hometown Chicago Sky to the franchise’s only WNBA championship.\n\nNicknamed the Women’s Dream Team, the 1996 Team USA women’s national squad remains one of the most dominant in the game’s history. It was led by several prominent names who are already individually enshrined in the Naismith Hall of Fame: Dawn Staley, Lisa Leslie, Rebecca Lobo, Sheryl Swoopes, Teresa Edwards and Katrina McClain. The roster also included Jennifer Azzi, Ruthie Bolton, Venus Lacy, Nikki McCray, Carla McGhee and Katy Steding. Credited with aiding the launch of the WNBA, this team defeated opponents by an average of 28.6 points per game en route to gold medal honors.\n\nDelle Donne, whose 10-year career ended in 2023, is the only player in WNBA history to win MVP honors with multiple franchises (2019 with Washington Mystics, 2015 with Chicago Sky). She steps closer to the hall thanks to her unique combination of shooting touch and basketball IQ, becoming the first player in WNBA history to join the prestigious 50-40-90 club (shooting at least 50 percent overall, 40 percent on 3-pointers and 90 percent on free throws for a full season). Her career scoring average of 19.5 points per game ranks fifth highest in WNBA history.\n\nHoldsclaw won WNBA Rookie of the Year honors in 1999 after averaging 16.9 points and 7.9 rebounds in her first season as a pro. She finished in the top 10 of MVP voting six times over her 11 WNBA seasons, during which she averaged 16.9 points and 7.6 rebounds. She peaked in 2003, averaging 20.5 points and 10.9 rebounds for the Washington Mystics. She finished her career with three All-WNBA selections and six All-Star nods and notched the 2002 league scoring title while leading the league in rebounds twice. But those accomplishments weren’t a surprise given her elite collegiate career at Tennessee, where she won Naismith Player of the Year honors twice (1998-99) and led the Lady Volunteers to three titles.\n\nFor the men’s side of this year’s finalist bracket, Rivers is one of seven coaches in NBA history to win Coach of the Year honors in their first season with a team, doing so with the Orlando Magic in 1999-00. His 1,183 regular-season wins rank sixth in NBA history. In 2008, he led the greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history as the Boston Celtics snapped a championship drought of over 20 years. In 2022, the NBA named Rivers as one of the 15 greatest coaches in league history.\n\nGriffin, who retired after the 2022-23 season, spent years as one of the most talented and athletic players in the NBA. He averaged 21.4 points and 9.0 rebounds over 765 career games, including a special run as the face of Lob City during arguably the most successful era in the LA Clippers’ history. For the 2013-14 season, he finished third in MVP voting after averaging 24.3 points (second-highest scoring average of his career), 9.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists. His seven triple-doubles are tied for second most in Clippers history.\n\nLike Griffin’s, Stoudemire’s athletic prowess and unmatched skill on offense made for a unique mix over a special career. He was pivotal to the Phoenix Suns’ revival led by two-time MVP Steve Nash and then-coach Mike D’Antoni, who joins Stoudemire as a finalist for the Hall. Stoudemire notched six All-Star selections and five All-NBA nods over his 14-year career in the NBA. At his peak, the 2002-03 Rookie of the Year averaged over 25 points per game and was one of the league’s most potent dunkers. He finished his career with averages of 18.9 points and 7.8 rebounds in 846 career games.\n\nD’Antoni’s 253 regular-season wins with Phoenix rank third in franchise history. His run as coach of the Seven Seconds or Less Suns included two runs to the Western Conference finals. During D’Antoni’s four full seasons as coach (2004-05 to 2007-08), Phoenix ranked third in the NBA in win percentage (.707) and total victories (232).\n\nThere are 21 total finalists this year. Others include Marques Johnson, Mark Few, Jerry Welsh, Dick Motta, Gary McKnight, Kelvin Sampson, Molly Bolin-Kazmer, Tal Brody, Joey Crawford and Kevin Johnson. The inductees will be announced in April. Enshrinement weekend is scheduled for later this year at Mohegan Sun Arena, beginning with a tip-off celebration and awards gala Aug. 14. The commencement ceremony will take place the next day at the Symphony Hall in Springfield, Mass.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

From superstar point guards to versatile big men, this season’s leaders prove that elite passing is still one of basketball’s most beautiful arts.\n\n– 10.7 assists per game\nJokić continues to redefine what playmaking looks like from the center position. His vision is almost point-guard level, threading backdoor passes and cross-court lasers with effortless precision. Denver’s offense flows through him because he reads defenses two steps ahead. What makes his assists special isn’t just the number — it’s how calmly and creatively he creates easy shots for everyone else.\n\n– 9.6 assists per game\nCunningham has fully embraced the role of Detroit’s offensive orchestrator. He controls tempo, keeps defenders on his hip, and consistently finds shooters in rhythm. His size allows him to see over defenses, making sharp reads out of pick-and-roll situations. Cade’s passing has become the heartbeat of the Pistons’ offense.\n\n– 8.6 assists per game\nDončić remains one of the most dangerous dual threats in the league. His scoring gravity forces double teams, and he punishes them with pinpoint passes to cutters and shooters. Luka’s ability to manipulate defenders with hesitation dribbles opens up lanes others simply don’t see. Every possession feels like a chess match — and he’s usually winning it.\n\n– 8.2 assists per game\nJohnson’s playmaking leap has been one of the most impressive developments this season. As a forward, he pushes the pace and makes quick decisions in transition. Atlanta benefits from his versatility, as he can facilitate from the wing or the top of the key. His assists often come from aggressive drives that collapse the defense.\n\n– 8.1 assists per game\nEven years into his career, Harden remains an elite offensive conductor. His mastery of pick-and-roll reads and pocket passes keeps defenses constantly guessing. He patiently surveys the floor before delivering perfectly timed kick-outs to shooters. Harden’s passing IQ continues to age like fine wine.\n\n– 7.6 assists per game\nMurray’s chemistry with Jokić fuels one of the league’s most fluid offenses. He balances scoring and facilitating beautifully, knowing when to attack and when to distribute. His ability to draw help defenders opens clean looks on the perimeter. Murray’s assists often come in high-pressure moments, showcasing his composure.\n\n– 7.5 assists per game\nNembhard has quietly developed into a reliable floor general for Indiana. He makes smart, efficient reads and rarely forces unnecessary passes. His steady presence keeps the Pacers organized, especially in half-court sets. The growth in his assist numbers reflects his increasing confidence and command.\n\n– 7.4 assists per game\nLaMelo’s flair is unmatched when it comes to creative passing. Whether it’s a no-look dime or a full-court hit-ahead pass, he thrives on turning routine plays into highlights. His instinctive feel for spacing allows him to find teammates in stride. Charlotte’s offense sparks whenever he’s orchestrating.\n\n– 7.2 assists per game\nCollier’s emergence as a facilitator has been a bright spot for Utah. He shows maturity beyond his years with his patience in the lane and sharp kick-outs to shooters. His ability to break down defenders off the dribble creates consistent scoring chances for teammates. The assist numbers highlight his growing comfort at the NBA level.\n\n– 7.1 assists per game\nMitchell’s playmaking complements his well-known defensive intensity. He attacks gaps aggressively, forcing rotations that lead to open looks. His improved court awareness has elevated Miami’s ball movement this season. Mitchell’s assists often come from hustle plays that turn defense into offense.\n\nWith the spotlight of All-Star Weekend shining bright, these assist leaders have earned their place among the league’s most impactful players. Their ability to elevate teammates and control the flow of the game makes them invaluable every single night. As the second half of the season unfolds, expect their playmaking brilliance to continue defining the race toward the playoffs.\n\nSUPER BOWL: Way-too-early 2027 Super Bowl odds following NFL season\n\nNFL DRAFT: Updated 2026 NFL Draft order following Seahawks’ Super Bowl 60 win\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 for Week 15\n\nMLB: League advised teams to ‘tell players to carry their papers’ to avoid ICE detention\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Shocking details emerge from James Pearce Jr, Rickea Jackson domestic dispute\n\nThe post NBA assists per game season leaders before the 2026 All-Star weekend appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nAs the first quarter progressed, both teams kept it close, but the Knicks managed to edge ahead of the Suns just before the second quarter. Westchester then kicked it into gear, extending their lead to as many as 11 points in the first half while holding the Valley to just 19 points in the second quarter.\n\nDespite the deficit and being held under 20 points in the second, the Suns kept it competitive, trailing 56-47 at halftime.\n\nSep 24, 2025; Phoenix, AZ, USA; Phoenix Suns and Valley Suns guard Damion Baugh (30) poses for a portrait during Media Day at PHX Arena.

It didn’t take long for the Knicks to get their pace back, regaining their footing and taking an 81-70 lead.\n\nThe Knicks opened up another double-digit lead, but were limited from beyond the arc. It came down to the final seconds of the game, with the Valley in possession of the ball before Damion Baugh sank in a go-ahead shot from three to give the Suns the lead.\n\nFeb 6, 2026; Detroit, Michigan, USA; New York Knicks forward Pacome Dadiet (4) walks off the court after the game against the Detroit Pistons at Little Caesars Arena. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-Imagn Images\n\nWhile Westchester had the final possession, Pacome Dadiet couldn’t connect with a three-pointer of his own as the Suns rebounded to drain the clock.\n\n“It was obviously a good win,” head coach Paul Jesperson said postgame. “Kind of a unique period for us because we had that little break in between our last game… So we were able to get two really good practices in, which you don’t always get to go five-on-five, some of that stuff at this time of the year.”\n\nBaugh led the scoring for the Valley with 29 points, eight assists and five rebounds. Jaden Shackelford and RJ Nembhard Jr. had 22 points each in the victory.\n\nThe Valley Suns now look towards their next challenge, taking on the Salt Lake City Stars on Thursday, Feb. 12, at 12 p.m.\n\nZac Gallen and Diamondbacks reunion?

    "fullText": "Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs ran roughshod over the injury-depleted Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, the French superstar matching his NBA season high with 40 points in a 136-108 rout.\n\nWembanyama, whose California swing will include a second All-Star Game appearance on Sunday, added 12 rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot, connecting on 13 of 20 attempts from the field in his 26 minutes of work.\n\nThe Lakers were without a raft of starters, with LeBron James and Luka Doncic sidelined along with Austin Reaves and Marcus Smart.\n\nDoncic missed a third straight game with a hamstring strain. James sat out the second night of a back-to-back to manage foot arthritis.\n\nWembanyama took full advantage, setting the tone with 25 points in just eight minutes on the floor in the first quarter.\n\nHe had 37 by halftime -- the most by any player in a first half this season -- when the Spurs led 84-55.\n\nHe cooled off in the third quarter, but matched the 40 points he put up on opening night before sitting out the fourth period with the rest of the Spurs starters.\n\nThe only down note for the Spurs was an injury to 2025 Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle, who took a hard fall under the basket in the second quarter and exited with a pelvic contusion.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers, fueled by 30 points from Pascal Siakam, stunned the New York Knicks 137-134 in an overtime thriller at Madison Square Garden.\n\nEight Pacers players scored in double figures to bring home the win in a game that featured a season-high 39 lead changes.\n\nAndrew Nembhard added 24 points and 10 rebounds and Quenton Jackson scored 19, including two game-sealing free-throws with 3.9 seconds left in overtime.\n\nJalen Brunson scored 40 points with five rebounds and eight assists for the Knicks. Josh Hart chipped in a triple-double of 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.\n\nMikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns added 22 points apiece -- Towns drilling two free-throws to force overtime before fouling out in the extra session.\n\nThe Pacers scored the first nine points in overtime before the Knicks staged a furious rally, cutting the deficit to one on a three-pointer from Brunson before Jackson closed it out at the line.\n\nThe Pacers have been a shadow of the team that beat the Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals last season with Tyrese Haliburton sidelined by the ruptured Achilles tendon he suffered in their NBA Finals loss to Oklahoma City.\n\nBut they snapped a four-game skid with just their fourth road win of the season, this one against a Knicks team that came in tied for the second most home wins in the league with 21.\n\n\"This was a really important game for us,\" said Pacers coach Rick Carlisle. \"The season that we've had, this environment, the opponent -- our guys had a great collective spirit and collective will tonight.\"\n\nIn Houston, Kevin Durant scored 26 points to lead the Rockets to a 102-95 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nDown by one at halftime, the Rockets took control in the third quarter. They led by six going into the fourth and quickly pushed the lead to 15 to cruise home.",

    "fullText": "Toronto's Brandon Ingram is an All-Star again.\n\nIngram has been selected by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to replace the injured Stephen Curry on the USA Stripes team at the 2026 All-Star Game on Sunday in Los Angeles at the Intuit Dome (more on this year's format below).\n\nStephen Curry was voted an All-Star starter by the fans, but will sit out the game due to a case of \"runner's knee,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr announced Monday, as reported by Dalton Johnson at NBC Sports Bay Area.\n\nThis is Ingram's second All-Star appearance. He also played in the Chicago All-Star Game in 2020, when he was with the Pelicans, the year he won Most Improved Player.\n\nThis year, Ingram finished 10th in the Eastern Conference fan voting and eighth in the player voting. The only players who got more fan votes but are not in the game are Brooklyn's Michael Porter Jr. (day-to-day with a knee issue) and James Harden, who was recently traded from the Clippers — who are hosting this All-Star Game — to the Cavaliers.\n\nIngram earned this spot as the leading scorer on the No. 5-seeded Raptors, averaging 22 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game, with 33 games in which he scored 20 or more points.\n\nThis year, the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock — and it falls right in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format, a USA vs. World showdown that fans and players have been asking for.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players have been divided into three teams, two USA teams — USA Stripes and USA Stars — and one World Team. Those three teams will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games, each team playing at least two games.\n\nThe All-Star teams have been revealed!\n\nWhich team are you rolling with? pic.twitter.com/huNqFF6TWq\n\n— NBA on NBC and Peacock (@NBAonNBC) February 4, 2026\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title.

    "fullText": "As NBA All-Star Weekend approaches, sportsbooks have set the stage with favorites and underdogs in the 3-Point Contest, Slam Dunk contest, and other festivities.\n\nLillard has a 54.5% implied chance to reach the 3-Point Contest final.\n\nThree of the four Slam Dunk contest participants are rookies.\n\nThe NBA will host the first ever three-team All-Star Game tournament.\n\nAfter an estimated $1.76 billion was wagered on Super Bowl LX, the NBA world heads into its celebratory midyear pause.\n\nThis time of year is known for high-flying acts in the Slam Dunk contest, precision sharpshooting in the 3-Point Contest, the craftsmanship of the Skills Challenge, and, for the first time ever, a three-team All-Star Game tournament.\n\nKicking it off with the Slam Dunk contest, the top online sportsbooks can’t decide on a consensus favorite.\n\nGone are the days of the NBA’s biggest and brightest stars competing in the contest. Bryant, Johnson, and Richardson are all rookies, leaving 25-year-old and seven-year veteran Hayes as the group’s senior.\n\nHayes is also the most productive of the quartet, averaging a modest 6.5 points per game. However, he’s thrown down several highlight-worthy dunks in his career, including an Eastbay on Jan. 26.\n\nThis isn't Jaxson Hayes' first Eastbay...\n\nHe went between the legs for the slam on April 2, 2024 🤯 https://t.co/9IhnKU2Hr0 pic.twitter.com/x6DBABBBdr\n\nThe 3-Point Contest, meanwhile, is headlined by a player who could provide one of the best All-Star Weekend storylines in recent memory.\n\nLillard hasn’t appeared in an NBA game since he tore his Achilles in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals April 27. Despite that, he finds himself as the favorite or co-favorite at the two top sportsbooks and the only player with minus-money odds (-120) at FanDuel to qualify for the final round.\n\nThe longtime Portland Trail Blazers stalwart won the event in 2023 and 2024.\n\nDamian Lillard wins the NBA Three-Point Contest 🔥pic.twitter.com/0MCKjFOs7y\n\n— Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) February 19, 2023\n\nNotably, Charlotte Hornets rookie Kon Knueppel is second. A win would make him the first player in franchise history to hoist the trophy.\n\nThe Skills Challenge is being replaced by the Shooting Stars competition, which has not been seen at All-Star Weekend since 2015.\n\nThe competition will see three-person teams compete to score points by nailing jumpers from designated areas on the court. The last team to win was Team Bosh, which consisted of Chris Bosh, Dominique Wilkins, and Swin Cash.\n\nTeams competing in this year’s event include:\n\nTeam Knicks: Jalen Brunson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Allan Houston\nTeam Cameron: Kon Kneuppel, Jalen Johnson, Corey Maggette\nTeam All-Stars: Scottie Barnes, Chet Holmgren, Richard Hamilton\nTeam Harper: Dylan Harper, Ron Harper, Ron Harper Jr.\n\nThe new All-Star Game round-robin tournament will see three teams compete in four 12-minute games. The top two teams based on the aggregate score of their matchups will advance to the championship round, where they will play a final 12-minute contest.\n\nWhile FanDuel and DraftKings are split on which team will win the mini-tournament, they agree that USA Stars are the long shot.\n\nThe teams and individuals who will take the floor include:\n\nUSA Stars: Scottie Barnes, Devin Booker, Cade Cunningham, Jalen Duren, Anthony Edwards, Chet Holmgren, Jalen Johnson, Tyrese Maxey\nUSA Stripes: Jaylen Brown, Jalen Brunson, Brandon Ingram, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Donovan Mitchell, Norman Powell\nWorld: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Deni Avdija, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Alperen Sengun, Pascal Siakam, Karl-Anthony Towns, Victor Wembanyama\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Isaiah Stewart sprinting across the court to confront Miles Bridges during a heated Pistons-Hornets clash has sent NBA fans into meltdown.\n\nThe chaotic moment quickly overshadowed the game itself, with video clips spreading faster than officials could regain control.\n\nFootage shared by Legion Hoops captured the exact moment Isaiah Stewart broke into a full sprint toward Miles Bridges as tensions boiled over.\n\nThe incident unfolded during a dead ball after Bridges became involved in an altercation with Pistons big man Jalen Duren. As players converged, Stewart rushed in from a distance, escalating the confrontation within seconds.\n\nAccording to the official NBA report, Stewart, Bridges, Duren, and Charlotte’s Moussa Diabate were all ejected for fighting activity. The situation deteriorated so rapidly that officials had little choice but to clear multiple players from the floor.\n\nThe chaos did not stop there. Hornets head coach Charles Lee was also ejected later in the fourth quarter after aggressively approaching an official and needing to be restrained by his own player.\n\nFor Stewart, the moment reinforced a growing reputation. His willingness to jump into confrontations has become a defining part of his on-court identity, particularly in emotionally charged games.\n\nFan reaction online was immediate and polarising. Some drew dramatic historical comparisons, with one writing, “Malice the Palace 2.0,” referencing the league’s most infamous brawl.\n\nOthers focused on the league’s image. “This is not a good sight for the game,” one fan commented, echoing concerns about optics and discipline.\n\nNot everyone disapproved. Some embraced the chaos, with one post reading, “Isaiah Stewart will always be doing ts, and I love it.” That sentiment reflected a segment of fans who admire Stewart’s raw intensity.\n\nThere was also speculation about consequences. “Mr. Silver may make an example out of him,” one fan wrote, anticipating potential league discipline given Stewart’s history.\n\nAnother summed up the pattern bluntly. “I’ve never seen Isaiah Stewart’s video on the TL without a fight.” The comment captured how frequently Stewart finds himself at the center of viral confrontations.\n\nWith punches reportedly thrown and multiple ejections issued, the incident is now firmly on the NBA’s radar. Suspensions and fines remain possible as the league reviews the footage.\n\nWhy Seattle sports fans could have even more to celebrate after the Seahawks’ Super Bowl win\n\nKnicks star suggests five artists for next Super Bowl halftime show as Jalen Brunson reacts to Bad Bunny\n\nBad Bunny took a daring shot at LeBron James, the LA Lakers star must be outraged",

The organization must find a way to offload Williamson, Dejounte Murray, and any other veteran players to acquire future draft picks.\n\nThe Pacers have had the brutal season that was expected. The team lost their court general, Tyrese Haliburton, during last year’s NBA Finals, and it’s clear the team has no plans to rush him back this season. During Thursday’s trade deadline, the front office acquired veteran center Ivica Zubac for unrestricted free agent Bennedict Mathurin and two first-round picks. This move sets Indiana up for next season and beyond.\n\nWashington is one of the league’s worst in offense and defense. The team made another big splash last Thursday, acquiring Anthony Davis from Dallas. Once healthy, the Wizards’ starting lineup will feature Trae Young and Anthony Davis.\n\nThe Nets are dead last in points per game, and one of their best scorers, Cam Thomas, has missed more than half of the team’s games due to injury. Now is the time to add draft capital as the team has two first-round picks in 2027, 2028, and 2029. Brooklyn must hit on upcoming draft picks.\n\nAs of last Monday, Utah looked poised to trade forward Lauri Markkanen. The Jazz went another direction, acquiring Jaren Jackson Jr. on Tuesday. Jackson Jr. immediately bolsters the roster heading into next season.\n\nLast season’s deal that sent Luka Doncic to Los Angeles looks worse after last week. On Wednesday, Dallas sent Anthony Davis to Washington for a return of players, including Khris Middleton, two first-round picks, and three second-round picks. Between the trades of Doncic and Davis, the Mavericks did not receive a young player with high upside.\n\nMemphis traded Jaren Jackson Jr. last Tuesday, and shipping Ja Morant in an offseason trade will set the franchise in full rebuild mode. The Grizzlies have taken a 180 following last season’s dismissal of head coach Taylor Jenkins. Jenkins led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe weeks leading up to last Thursday’s trade deadline were headlined by Milwaukee potentially trading Giannis Antetokounmpo. The team fielded calls but decided no offers were good enough. The front office needs offseason upgrades, but the team’s superstar may force his way out this summer.\n\nChicago underwent a full teardown by the trade deadline. However, the team did not receive a single first-round pick in any trade. The Bulls will use their salary cap in the upcoming offseasons while packaging a plethora of second-round picks in future trades.\n\nCharlotte’s front office saw that the team was near the playoffs and added at the trade deadline. The team acquired Coby White from Chicago and Tyus Jones from Orlando. White and Jones add depth to the Hornets’ offense that ranks 11th in points per game.\n\nLos Angeles is in playoff contention and decided to move 36-year-old James Harden to Cleveland for point guard Darius Garland. Thursday’s deadline saw the team move veteran Ivica Zubac to Indiana for Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, and two first-round picks. The moves signaled the Clippers were unwilling to give Harden another big payday, and now is the time to rebuild the roster around younger players.\n\nThe Trail Blazers have struggled over the past two weeks but are contending for the play-in tournament. The front office didn’t make a move at the trade deadline, holding onto future draft picks. If Portland can improve defensively, they can reach the playoffs following the play-in tournament.\n\nAtlanta acquired offensive pieces after trading Kristaps Porzingis to Golden State for Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield. The additions of Kuminga and Hield upgrade the team’s depth. The Hawks are in contention to make it out of the Eastern Conference play-in tournament.\n\nOrlando’s main objective as the season continues is to have its roster healthy for the play-in tournament. The talent is there, and the Magic will be a tough matchup in the postseason. The team can make a push for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nOffensively, Miami ranks in the top five in points per game and will compete with any opposing team. The Heat’s issues start on defense. The team ranks near the bottom of the league in points allowed per game.\n\nGolden State moved disgruntled forward Jonathan Kuminga and guard Buddy Hield for center Kristaps Porzingis. They were unable to achieve the rumored deal to land Giannis Antetokounmpo from Milwaukee. The Warriors will continue feeling the loss of Jimmy Butler and will be lucky to get past the first round of the playoffs should they survive the play-in tournament.\n\nThe Raptors continue to march in the right direction. Their offense isn’t among the league’s best, but they haven’t dealt with serious injuries, and the defense ranks in the top 10. Improvements to the offense will lead Toronto to success as the season finishes out.\n\nThe 76ers didn’t make any splashes at the trade deadline but moved Jared McCain to the Thunder for a 2026 first-round pick and three second-round picks. Philadelphia is currently sitting in a playoff spot and needs a strong finish to the season. The team’s lack of depth may be their downfall in the playoffs.\n\nPhoenix has had a strong season and is hovering between a spot in the playoffs and the play-in tournament. The Suns’ defense has been a strong suit this season. Entering the playoffs healthy makes Phoenix a tough matchup for any opposing team.\n\nLos Angeles continues to battle Phoenix for a solidified spot in the playoffs or a trip to the play-in tournament. Defensive lapses have caused the Lakers issues this season, but the team continues to rebound. This may be LeBron James’s last shot at another title.\n\nThe Timberwolves added a depth piece when they acquired Ayo Dosunmu from the Bulls. Dosunmu gives the team versatility as a ball handler or shooting guard. Minnesota is ready to spring into the postseason.\n\nSince the end of December, Cleveland has gone on a run. The Cavaliers have moved up the Eastern Conference standings and are resembling the strong team they had last season. Ahead of last week’s trade deadline, the team acquired James Harden in exchange for Darius Garland. Harden gives the team a reliable option on offense.\n\nThe Rockets continue their consistent play and are one of the league’s best defensive teams. The team didn’t make any trade deadline deals and feels content with the current state of the roster. Houston can be a contender for the Western Conference Finals if Kevin Durant is healthy.\n\nDenver is one of the three best teams in the Western Conference. Nikola Jokic missed time a month ago, but Jamal Murray picked up the slack as he’s having the best season of his career and earned his first All-Star selection. A healthy Denver team, led by Nikola Jokic, can beat anyone in the playoffs.\n\nBoston continues to be one of the Eastern Conference’s top teams after many expected the team to struggle following Jayson Tatum’s injury in last season’s playoffs. Needing an upgrade at center, the Celtics acquired Nikola Vucevic from the Bulls. Boston has the talent to reach the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOne of the league’s best on offense and defense, New York is ready to chase Detroit for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks were close to reaching the NBA Finals last season and have unfinished business. If New York and Detroit face off in the conference finals, the Knicks’ experience may give them the edge in the series.\n\nSan Antonio has been near the top of the Western Conference throughout the season. Victor Wembanyama has stayed healthy and is leading the team. Wembanyama’s previous seasons have ended following the All-Star Break. If the Spurs want to be serious title contenders, they must do everything in their power to keep Victor Wembanyama on the court.\n\nDetroit has sat atop the Eastern Conference for most of the season. The team has produced a top 10 offense and a top 3 defense. The front office added a much-needed three-point shooter, acquiring Kevin Huerter from the Bulls.\n\nOklahoma City has been the favorite to win the championship throughout the season. They lead the league in points scored and points allowed per game. The front office added a high-upside depth piece when they acquired Jared McCain from Philadelphia at the trade deadline.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break appeared first on The Big Lead.",

At the end of the day, we would love to keep it basketball, but things happen. Everybody was just playing hard,\" Duren said after the match.\n\n\"This isn't the first time that people have tried to be like extra aggressive with us and talk to us, whatever the case may be.\n\n\"At the end of the day, emotions got high with everybody being competitive. Things happen.\"\n\nBridges later apologised to fans, writing on Instagram: \"Sorry Hornets nation! Sorry Hornets Organization! Always going to protect my team-mates forever.\"\n\nLead official John Goble said in a post-game report the players were ejected because they \"engaged in fighting activity during the dead ball\".\n\n\"After review, we assessed fighting fouls, and by rule, they were ejected from the game,\" he added.\n\nLee, asked about the clash between Diabate and Duren that triggered the wider brawl, said: \"Two guys got in a heated conversation and then it kind of spiralled from there.\"\n\nOf his own ejection in the fourth quarter, Lee added: \"I've got to have a little bit better emotional control in that moment.\"\n\nElsewhere, Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry will miss Sunday's All-Star game with an injury to his right knee.\n\nHowever, the Warriors are hopeful Curry will return after the All-Star break for the game against the Boston Celtics on 19 February.",

    "fullText": "The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons put on a show Monday night, and it had little to do with basketball. In the third quarter, players from both sides got into an all-out brawl that baffled spectators, and other NBA players who later saw the footage had strong reactions as well.\n\nThe altercation began when Moussa Diabate fouled Jalen Duren. Duren responded by pushing Diabaté in the face, which quickly escalated the situation. Moments later, Isaiah Stewart came running from the Pistons bench and got into it with Miles Bridges, who had also stepped into the fray. The chaos ultimately led to all four players being ejected.\n\nJaylen Brown was at home, streaming. And with the Hornets vs. Pistons brawl being the talk of the town, he decided to react to it.\n\nThe Celtics star understood why Diabate lost his cool. In the heat of the moment, he said that when someone “mushes” or shoves another player’s face, it can make your blood boil. Brown even hinted that he might have reacted the same way if he were in Diabate’s position.\n\n“If a dude takes his hand and mush your face like that… I ain’t gon lie, somebody gotta die,” Brown declared, treating the mushing of one’s face as the ultimate disrespect.\n\nThe NBA, however, will not agree with Diabate or any of the other three involved. The players will likely be suspended, with Stewart, who ran the length of the court to join a fight he was not initially involved in, expected to face the harshest penalty.\n\nStewart, meanwhile, was unapologetic. “You don’t expect me to sit on the bench. The f *k I got drafted to Detroit for,”* he was heard saying in the tunnel after getting ejected. Duren, on the other hand, seemed to realize that the situation got out of hand.\n\n“At the end of the day, we would love to keep it basketball, but things happen. Everybody was just playing hard,” he said, but admittedthat the Pistons have been targeted by rivals throughout the entire season. “This isn’t the first time that people have tried to be like extra aggressive with us and talk to us, whatever the case may be.”\n\nThe post “Somebody Gotta Die”: Jaylen Brown Assesses Jalen Duren ‘Mushing’ Moussa Diabate’s Face During Hornets-Pistons Brawl appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Throughout NBA history, the Los Angeles Lakers have been home to some of the most dominant scorers the game has ever seen. From the league’s earliest days to the modern era, Lakers stars have not only carried their team offensively but also set the scoring standard for the entire NBA. Leading the league in scoring while wearing purple and gold has always signaled a season of individual brilliance and historical significance.\n\n2025–26: 33.5 PPG (current pace)\n\nIn his first season wearing a Lakers uniform, Doncic immediately established himself as the league’s most dominant offensive force. His scoring lead reflects a rare blend of volume, efficiency, and creativity, as he punishes defenses at all three levels. Luka’s ability to control tempo while still producing elite numbers makes this season feel both historic and sustainable. If the pace holds, it would be one of the most impressive scoring campaigns in franchise history.\n\nKobe’s back-to-back scoring titles represent the apex of his individual offensive dominance. The 2004–05 season showcased his unmatched shot-making and willingness to shoulder the entire offensive burden. In 2005–06, he followed it up with another scoring crown, highlighted by legendary performances and relentless competitiveness. These seasons cemented Bryant as the most feared scorer of his era.\n\nShaq’s scoring title came during the lockout-shortened season, where his physical dominance was simply overwhelming. Defenses had no answer for his combination of size, power, and touch around the rim. Night after night, opponents were forced to foul or concede easy points. This season set the stage for the Lakers’ upcoming dynasty.\n\nJerry West led the league in scoring during a period defined by tough defense and limited spacing, making his numbers even more remarkable. His offensive game was built on precision, footwork, and an unshakable confidence in big moments. West carried the Lakers with consistency and poise, embodying the prototype of a complete guard. This season further solidified his legacy as one of the greatest scorers of his generation.\n\nGeorge Mikan was the NBA’s first true dominant scorer and the foundation of the Lakers’ early success. His three consecutive scoring titles came at a time when the league was still defining itself, and Mikan was clearly ahead of his peers. He forced rule changes, reshaped defensive strategies, and established the center position as the game’s focal point. These seasons made him the original face of Lakers greatness.\n\nEach Lakers player who led the NBA in scoring reflects a different era, style, and evolution of the game, yet all share the same impact: offensive supremacy. Whether through finesse, power, or relentless shot-making, these seasons stand as benchmarks of greatness within the franchise’s storied legacy. Together, they reinforce why the Lakers remain synonymous with elite scorers and unforgettable individual performances.\n\nThe post Los Angeles Lakers players who led NBA in scoring appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NBA Three-Point Contest brings together a compelling mix of proven champions, first-time participants, and rising shooters who reflect how central the long ball has become in today’s game. From seasoned All-Stars with past hardware to young players eager to announce themselves on a national stage, this field is stacked with both credibility and intrigue. Each competitor enters with a distinct shooting profile, ensuring a contest defined by contrasting styles, streaks, and momentum swings.\n\nDevin Booker returns to the Three-Point Contest as one of the more experienced shooters in the field, bringing back memorable performances from past All-Star Weekends. Although his current 3-point percentage this season is a career low, his pedigree and confidence with the deep ball keep him a threat on the racks. Booker won this event in 2018 and has made multiple appearances, which gives him both historical relevance and fan appeal. Expect him to lean on his rhythm and composure when the clock starts.\n\nRookie Kon Knueppel has quickly established himself as one of the league’s rising long-range threats with an excellent percentage this season. His inclusion in the contest marks a rare opportunity for a first-year player to compete for the title, and he’ll aim to become the first rookie ever to win. Knueppel’s high volume and efficient shooting make him a serious contender right out of the gate. His youth and fearless shooting style will be fun to watch as he battles veterans.\n\nDespite missing the entire NBA season with a torn Achilles, Damian Lillard will still suit up for the 3-Point Contest, a testament to his elite reputation as a marksman. Lillard is a two-time winner of this event and can tie the all-time record with his third title. His career 3-point scoring and clutch gene make him a perennial fan favorite, regardless of in-season play. Lillard’s participation adds a compelling storyline of resilience and competitive pride.\n\nTyrese Maxey enters the contest riding a breakout season as one of the NBA’s most dynamic scorers, combining pace with deep shooting prowess. This will be his first appearance in the Three-Point Contest, aligning with his first All-Star starter nod. Maxey’s ability to make tough catch-and-shoot attempts under pressure gives him a versatile edge on the racks. His confidence from downtown blends well with his overall offensive game, making him a dark-horse candidate.\n\nDonovan Mitchell is another All-Star entering the contest with a reputation for confident and flashy deep shooting. As the Cavaliers’ lead scorer, Mitchell blends volume with creativity, often pulling up from range in rhythm. His presence adds star power and competitive intensity to the field, especially when the spotlight gets bright. Expect Mitchell to attack the money balls with the same aggression he brings in late-game situations.\n\nJamal Murray brings his sharpshooting pedigree from both the regular season and playoff stages to the Three-Point Contest. Known for his calm demeanor and clutch threes, Murray complements Stephen Curry’s shooting leadership in Denver’s offense. This appearance aligns with his first All-Star selection, showcasing his ascent among the league’s premier perimeter scorers. Given his range and confidence, he can heat up quickly when the rack lights turn on.\n\nVeteran forward Bobby Portis Jr. earned his first 3-Point Contest nod thanks to a breakout shooting season, boasting one of the highest percentages among contestants. His stride into elite floor spacing has helped Milwaukee’s offense evolve, making him more than a traditional big man. Portis’ smooth release and catch-and-shoot rhythm make him a legitimate threat in this format. His inclusion underscores how modern bigs can impact spacing and contest formats alike.\n\nNorman Powell enters the event as an All-Star and one of Miami’s most reliable 3-point shooters this season. His shooting profile blends athleticism with catch-and-shoot efficiency, and he has experience from prior contests as well. Powell’s ability to get hot in spurts could make him dangerous in the rapid-fire rhythm of the 3-Point Contest. As a player who thrives in momentum, he’ll look to heat up early and carry it through the rounds.\n\nWhen the final rack is emptied on Saturday, February 14 at 5:00 p.m. ET, the 2026 Three‑Point Contest is sure to hinge on rhythm, confidence, and a competitor’s ability to perform under the clock. With this blend of elite scorers, specialists, and fearless newcomers all taking aim at the same moment, the difference between victory and elimination could be a single swish or miss. No matter who hoists the title at the State Farm 3‑Point Contest, this field underscores how deep shooting continues to define the modern NBA and why this event remains one of All‑Star Weekend’s most anticipated traditions.\n\nThe post NBA 2026 Three-point contest participants appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Guarding Michael Jordan never felt more like a death sentence than it did for Kevin Johnson during the 1993 NBA Finals. Johnson has long stated how he feels terrible about how Charles Barkley is ringless due to that Finals. However, with MJ on the other end of the court, perhaps that was inevitable?\n\nThe ’93 Finals had several intersecting and interesting storylines. One was the fact that Jordannever saw Dan Majerle as a threat. Dan was propped up to be a ‘Jordan stopper’ of sorts but this didn’t move the needle for him in the slightest.\n\nGames 1 and 2 saw Jordan score a total of 73 points and the Bulls go up 2-0 with Majerle guarding ‘His Airness’. The Suns coaching staff saw this as a clear misstep and defensive deficiency. Their next course of action? Have Kevin Johnson take up the task.\n\n“I walk straight in that church and I sit in the front row. I’m like, ‘Jesus, I don’t believe in you no more,’” saidJohnson the Club520 podcast. The concept of having to defend Michael in the Finals was so unfathomable for KJ that he, at first, believed he had dreamt it.\n\nWhen he told MJ during Game 3’s jumpball that he was guarding him, the latter’s reaction was a mere “Huh?”\n\nFunnily enough, the Suns ended up winning Game 3 in triple overtime despite Jordan’s 44. Johnson was no scrub however as he held his own on the offensive end as well, going 11-24 from the field and having 25 points on the night.\n\nThe Suns won two out of their three games in Chicago but would eventually lose Game 6, leading to the Bulls winning their third straight title.\n\nKevin is still quite proud of the way he guarded Mike though, saying “Take that Mike!” on the podcast when speaking on keeping MJ below the scoring average he had when guarded by Dan.\n\nThe post Kevin Johnson Entered a Church to Pray Before Guarding Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "For the first time in four years, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander won't participate at NBA All-Star weekend. Once he was ruled out through the break with an abdominal strain, the reigning MVP's absence let out some air from the balloon in a three-day event that highlights the league's best players.\n\nAlperen Sengun has replaced Gilgeous-Alexander as a 2026 NBA All-Star injury replacement. He will take his spot on Team World in the three-team round-robin tournament that replaces Sunday's traditional All-Star Game.\n\nSengun's NBA All-Star teammates are Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Victor Wembanyama, Karl-Anthony Towns, Jamal Murray, Deni Avdija and Pascal Siakam.\n\nSengun joins teammate Kevin Durant for the star-studded event. Both will represent the Houston Rockets. Just yesterday, the hospital Oklahoma City Thunder dropped a 112-106 loss to them. Sengun had a 17-point, 12-rebound and 11-assist triple-double.\n\nThe Thunder continue to voyage through Gilgeous-Alexander's absence. So far, they're 0-2 in a five-game stretch. Never ideal to be without your best player, but sacrificing five games for three weeks off is pretty economical.\n\nThe Thunder will still be part of the NBA All-Star weekend extravaganza. Chet Holmgren will be part of Team USA stars. His teammates are Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Devin Booker, Tyrese Maxey, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Johnson and Jalen Duren.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 2026 NBA All-Star replacement revealed",

    "fullText": "One of the best stories recently in the NBA has been second-year former Trojan Isaiah Collier continuing to make the most of his opportunities. After Collier's career night, dishing out 22 assists, 17 points, and 3 steals, Collier built off that and led his team in scoring.\n\nThe Jazz have been without Keyonte George, and Collier is making up for the majority of his impact. Collier last night had a team-high 25 points, 11 assists, and 3 steals again. Collier has now had 5 straight games with a steal and a combined 13 steals in that span. It is not just his scoring output or his ability to find his teammates for good looks; he is also quite the defender.\n\nCollier is becoming more and more of a polished all-around basketball player. Any team, regardless of how deep the rotation is, can use a guy like Collier. He is proving to be extremely valuable for this team moving forward.\n\nThe Jazz are not looking to win games this season, even after the trade for star forward Jaren Jackson Jr. and ascending young players. This team wants a shot at a top pick in the upcoming draft. This upcoming class is full of stars. Yet when you are not trying to win, it is important to allow your young guys an opportunity to develop and see which players will be building blocks for the future.\n\nNow, after his recent great production in his starts, Collier is proving to be one of the pieces for the Utah Jazz moving forward. He is now averaging 10 points, 7.1 assists per contest, and shooting 50% from the field. He may not likely be a starting player for the Jazz when this lineup is ready to contend, but he has definitely shown he will be a key contributor in the rotation. Heck, he has shown he can be a player that steps up when stars go down with injury.\n\nThe Utah Jazz are building some special, and part of that is because of how great the former USC Trojan Isaiah Collier has been this season. The Jazz may not get any real success this season, but the next season should be one in which conversations about the Jazz look very different.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Isaiah Collier is enhancing USC basketball brand in NBA with Jazz",

    "fullText": "The NBA MVP race is beginning to take real shape, with clear frontrunners separating themselves as the season moves past its midpoint. Betting odds now reflect not just raw statistics, but team success, narrative momentum, and nightly impact across the league. From established superstars to rising faces driving unexpected contenders, the MVP conversation is deeper than it first appears.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander sits comfortably atop the MVP futures market after back-to-back elite seasons and leading Oklahoma City to one of the league’s best records. His scoring prowess and all-around impact have triggered MVP buzz, and he’s continued to show growth as a facilitator and defender. The narrative around SGA as a legitimate back-to-back MVP contender has only strengthened as the Thunder emerge as a true title contender. Voters often reward both team success and statistical dominance, and he delivers on both fronts.\n\nNikola Jokić remains one of the most uniquely dominant players in NBA history — a perennial MVP presence with a rare combination of scoring, playmaking and rebounding for a center. Even with Denver not topping the standings, his efficiency and court vision keep him squarely in the award conversation. Jokic’s ability to influence winning in so many statistical areas makes him irresistible to a certain slice of voters. His experience and broad skill set mean he can surge late if Nuggets’ team performance improves.\n\nLuka Dončić continues his MVP-caliber rise in Los Angeles, producing gaudy scoring, assist and rebound numbers night after night. His March and April performances often define MVP narratives, and if he carries the Lakers deep into the standings, his odds will tighten. Dončić’s marketability and high-usage role give him a real story appeal with voters — a flashy star leading an iconic franchise. Sustained excellence and healthy availability position him as the most compelling challenger behind the favorites.\n\nCade Cunningham has steadily climbed MVP boards by turning Detroit into an unexpectedly strong team in the East. His balance of scoring, playmaking, and defensive improvement has transformed the Pistons into a top-tier squad. While Pistons’ overall reputation may lag behind some contenders, Cunningham’s leadership is undeniable. Should Detroit continue exceeding expectations, he stands to benefit significantly in MVP voting.\n\nJaylen Brown’s MVP case hinges on Boston’s success and consistency as a top East seed while carrying increased offensive responsibility. A gifted two-way wing, Brown’s metrics often reflect efficient scoring and defensive impact. If he sustains high usage with balanced efficiency and Celtics stay elite, his narrative will improve. Voters may reward his often underappreciated contributions if Brown becomes the clear focal point of a championship-level team.\n\nTyrese Maxey’s odds are long primarily due to team context — a 76ers squad that has struggled for consistency — but his individual production has been impressive. Known for his scoring outbursts and clutch shooting, Maxey can light up the stat sheet any night. For MVP consideration, sustained team success is critical, which currently limits his market position. Still, as a budding star, Maxey’s profile could rise if Philly shifts toward a more impactful regular season.\n\nAnthony Edwards has the raw star talent to climb MVP boards — elite scoring, athleticism and flair for big moments — but his MVP odds reflect team inconsistencies and limited playoff expectations. If Minnesota makes a leap into the top echelon of the West, his value proposition improves dramatically. Edwards’ personality and highlight-level scoring give him a narrative edge, but MVP voters typically balance that with team success. Watch for late-season surges to flip his standing.\n\nJalen Brunson’s MVP floor rests more on his excellence than his current team’s record position — the Knicks’ defensive identity doesn’t always translate to traditional MVP narratives. As a steady veteran leader with efficient scoring and playmaking, Brunson ticks many boxes, though sustaining this into MVP consideration requires Knicks to inch into elite territory. His narrative hinges on exceeding expectations with a gritty, team-first profile.\n\nDonovan Mitchell’s MVP odds reflect Cavs’ standing as competitive but not among the league’s elite, limiting his case despite strong perimeter scoring. Known for explosive offense, Mitchell still needs a breakout franchise season to garner MVP traction. If Cleveland shocks top franchises and Mitchell pushes them, his narrative could shift. Right now, he represents a long-shot with scoring appeal but modest MVP viability.\n\nKawhi Leonard’s MVP odds are more symbolic than realistic — injuries and limited availability make sustained MVP candidacy unlikely. When healthy, he’s a two-time Finals MVP and perennial All-Star with elite two-way impact. However, MVP awards rarely go to players with restricted games, especially given Clippers’ middling results. Leonard’s narrative is better suited to playoff impact than regular-season hardware.\n\nWhile the odds suggest a favorite, the MVP race is far from settled, especially with months of high-leverage basketball still ahead. Late-season surges, injuries, and shifts in the standings can dramatically reshape voter perception. As history has shown, the final stretch often decides who turns elite production into league-wide recognition.\n\nThe post NBA MVP odds as of February 6, 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Clippers were one of the hottest teams in the NBA heading into the trade deadline, and nobody saw what came next.\n\nAfter rattling off a 16-3 stretch that pulled them from the bottom of the Western Conference standings all the way into play-in position, the front office decided to blow it up.\n\nIn the span of just a few days, the Clippers moved their second- and third-best players, James Harden and Ivica Zubac, turning what looked like a late-season push into a full-blown rebuild on the fly.\n\nThe Clippers now sit at 23-27 on the season and are left with more questions than answers as they head into All-Star Weekend as the host team at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe first domino fell on Tuesday when the Clippers sent 11-time All-Star James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for two-time All-Star Darius Garland and a second-round pick.\n\nHarden had been the engine that kept Los Angeles afloat all season, averaging 25.4 points and 8.1 assists per game while carrying the team through a brutal 6-21 start.\n\nHe was having his best scoring season in six years, so the move caught almost everyone off guard.\n\nBREAKING: The Los Angeles Clippers are trading James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Darius Garland and a second-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Prolific swap of the star point guards. pic.twitter.com/IHhhhabJnX\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 4, 2026\n\nFor the Clippers, though, it was about looking ahead.\n\nGarland is 10 years younger than Harden and is locked into a long-term deal that runs through 2028-29.\n\nHe is recovering from a toe injury that has kept him out since January 14, but when healthy he is a strong scorer and playmaker who averaged 20.6 points and 6.7 assists last season.\n\nClippers president Lawrence Frank said the team is \"trying to get younger while continuing to win,\" and Garland fits that goal on both ends.\n\nThe Clippers were not done there. On Thursday, they sent starting center Ivica Zubac and forward Kobe Brown to the Indiana Pacers in a deal that brought back a big haul of young talent and draft picks.\n\nLos Angeles received Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, two first-round picks and a second-round pick in return.\n\nFULL TRADE DETAILS:\n\nPacers receive:\nIvica Zubac\nKobe Brown\n\nClippers receive:\nBenedict Mathurin\nIsaiah Jackson\n2 1st-round picks\n2nd-round pick pic.twitter.com/iCAvemn9ls\n\n— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) February 5, 2026\n\nZubac had been the longest-tenured Clipper on the roster, having joined the team back in 2019 after being traded from the cross-town rival Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe was putting up 14.4 points and 11.0 rebounds per game this season while shooting over 61 percent from the floor, and he was coming off a career year in 2024-25 that earned him All-Defensive Second Team honors.\n\nThe centerpiece coming back is Mathurin, a 23-year-old wing who has been averaging 17.8 points per game this season and gives Los Angeles the kind of young scoring talent they will need going forward.\n\nThe draft capital is a big part of this, too. The Pacers' 2026 first-round pick is protected 1-4 and 10-30, which means the Clippers only get it if it falls between the fifth and ninth picks.\n\nIndiana currently has one of the worst records in the league, so there is close to a coin flip chance it lands in that range. If it does not, it turns into an unprotected 2031 first-rounder from Indiana, and the Clippers also picked up an unprotected 2029 first from the Pacers.\n\nWhat makes the timing so shocking is that the Clippers had just gone on that incredible 16-3 run and seemed to have real momentum going.\n\nThe Clippers pivoted HARD and turned James Harden and Ivica Zubac into:\n\n- Darius Garland\n- Bennedict Mathurin\n- Two first-round picks, including a potential lottery pick.\n\nHats off to the front office.\n\n— Grant \"Money\" Mona (@Gmona48) February 5, 2026\n\nThey had the oldest roster in the NBA this season with six core players aged 31 or older, and the front office clearly decided that a possible first-round exit in the playoffs was not worth passing up the chance to get younger and stockpile assets.\n\nKawhi Leonard will remain with the team for now, but his future in Los Angeles will be a major talking point this offseason.\n\nFor a franchise that came into the year swinging for the fences with a veteran-heavy roster, this was a pivot that nobody expected, and the ripple effects will be felt for years to come.\n\nFor now, though, it is a new era in Inglewood.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets have waived guard Pat Connaughton, the team announced Wednesday night.\n\nConnaughton has played in 22 games this season, averaging 2.9 points and 1.4 rebounds. He's shot a career-high 40.7% from three in his limited action.\n\nThe move opens a roster spot for guard Tyus Jones, who the Hornets acquired from the Orlando Magic on Wednesday.\n\nMore:Former Hornets center could be on the move from Phoenix\n\nConnaughton was on a $9.4 million contract, which expires if he's not claimed by another team within two days.\n\nIt's been another busy trade deadline for Hornets General Manager Jeff Peterson. Charlotte also acquired Coby White from the Chicago Bulls for Collin Sexton and sent Mason Plumlee to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nThe moves give the Hornets more depth in the backcourt behind star guards LaMelo Ball and Kon Knueppel. Veteran guard Tre Mann is also on the roster but has seen a diminished role this season.\n\nThis was Connaughton's first season in Charlotte after being acquired from the Milwaukee Bucks last July. The Hornets sent Vasilije Micic to Milwaukee for Connaughton and two second-round picks.\n\nHe's best known for his seven-year run with the Bucks, where he won an NBA Championship in 2021. He was a steady contributor in Milwaukee, playing 20+ minutes per game in five seasons.\n\nConnaughton, an 11-year NBA veteran, could be a solid depth addition for a contending team. He's shot over 37% from three in four seasons and has plenty of playoff experience.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Peterson and Charlotte will make more moves ahead of Thursday's deadline.

For Anthony Edwards in 2025, it meant saying goodbye to Mike Conley Jr., a veteran who had been instrumental in the Minnesota Timberwolves’ recent rise in the league.\n\nConley had a rollercoaster 24 hours. He was first traded to the Chicago Bulls, who just one day later, sent him to the Charlotte Hornets. But that may not be the end of this trade-deadline adventure, as there’s a chance he may have to pack his bags again.\n\nEdwards, after the Timberwolves’ victory over the Toronto Raptors earlier today, admitted to hearing that the organization can try to get him back. As a result, he decided to do his part.\n\nConley joined the Wolvesin 2023 and quickly became one of the leaders in the locker room as they made two trips to the Conference Finals. In particular, helped Edwards a lot when he was struggling.\n\n“Mike man, he’s an OG. Always helped me when I was struggling on court. Great conversations off the court, great dude overall,” Edwards said.\n\nThe trade deadline day can be brutal. Players who have been comfortable in a city for years may be forced to move to the other side of the country and turn their lives upside down in a matter of hours. For Conley, he’s already traveled from Minneapolis to Chicago and on to Charlotte.\n\nSo, due to the Andrew Bogut rule, given that he’s been traded twice in the span of 24 hours, he can now return to the original team that he left. Seem as though Edwards keeps hoping that he flies right back home.\n\n“I keep hearing he can come back, so hopefully he will, and I hope he sees this,” Edwards said. “We want you back, Mike. He knows we miss him.”\n\nThe Timberwolves organization would ideally love to bring someone of Conley’s stature back. He wasn’t playing much in 25/26, but had an invaluable veteran presence. And if Edwards, arguably the cornerstone of Minnesota, asks the front office to try to make a move for him again, they would at least give it a try.\n\nThe post “We Want You Back”: Anthony Edwards Sends Heartfelt Message to “OG” Mike Conley appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Rivalries are the backbone of the NBA. Rivals Week just passed, but the lineup wasn’t up to par. Some fan-favorite matchups are missing, such as the Spurs and Thunder, or the historic Celtics and Lakers, built off the backs of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\n\nPlayer rivalries build team rivalries. Seeing players go head-to-head to prove who’s the best is what makes the NBA the most entertaining.\n\nWith that being said, here are the four best player rivalries currently taking place in the NBA:\n\nAnytime Lebron faces off with Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, it’s still a marquee matchup. LeBron, Durant, and Curry are a callback to an era now passed. Every time the NBA begins a new season, fans know they are that much closer to these show-stopping battles are coming to an end.\n\nThat means every game is a must-watch. When any combination of these three go head-to-head, it’s apparent how badly they each want to come out victorious over the other.\n\nFrom Finals matchups to random regular-season contests, each of the three give their all when they step on the court against each other.\n\nA different side of LeBron comes out when he faces Dillon Brooks. We’ve never seen a player get under the King’s skin like the Phoenix Suns guard. This rivalry has been filled with trash talk, physical confrontations, and heated moments.\n\nBrooks is averaging a career high of 21.1 points per game and elevates his play every time he goes up against the Lakers. Los Angeles’ last matchup with the Suns ended in a blowout.\n\nIt seems like Brooks has made it his personal mission to mess with the Hall of Famer, and fans are eagerly awaiting their next duel.\n\nChet Holmgren going up against Victor Wembanyama has been one of the NBA’s most compelling feuds as of late.\n\nSince Wembanyama entered the NBA, he and Chet have had a budding rivalry. The two towering figures first faced off in the 2021 FIBA World Cup, where Holmgren and Team USA walked out with the win.\n\nThe Spurs seem to have the Thunder’s number this year, as they’ve beaten them three times this season. It feels like Wembanyama circles every Thunder game on his calendar.\n\nWembanyama is on a mission to prove he’s far and away the best young center in the NBA. The Spurs’ phenom is a generational talent, but Holmgren has something he doesn’t: a championship ring.\n\nEdwards Vs. SGA is a heavyweight fight with the title for best guard in the NBA on the line. The intensity always reaches a fever pitch when these two play each other. The two players mirror each other in many ways. Both became leaders of their team at a relatively young age and became stars around the same time.\n\nAnt and SGA have taken subtle shots at each other through shoe commercials. It’s clear they both have immense respect for each other, but are fighting to be the best. The Timberwolves have won two out of three matchups with the Thunder this season, but these two will be battling it out for years to come.\n\nAttention player haters and disbelievers of all kinds… pic.twitter.com/5tzoBwvUZ4\n\n— adidas Basketball (@adidasHoops) October 24, 2025\n\nThe post What Are the Best Player Rivalries In the NBA Today? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James has offered a fascinating insight into how a legendary WWE heel turn helped shape one of the most controversial chapters of his NBA career.\n\nAfter all, the Los Angeles Lakers star explained that his time with the Miami Heat was influenced by an unlikely wrestling icon.\n\nJames’ decision to embrace the villain role after leaving Cleveland in 2010 transformed how fans viewed him, and he has since acknowledged that the reaction was not only anticipated but studied.\n\nSpeaking on a recent episode of the Mind the Game podcast, LeBron revealed that the late WWE legend Hulk Hogan played a key role in how he understood fame, backlash, and reinvention.\n\n“I grew up watching Hulk Hogan. At one point, Hulk Hogan was like America, as everyone loved him. What it means to be an American.\n\nThen one day, he went to N.W.O. and people couldn’t understand how he tagged up with the enemy,” James said.\n\nHe added: “They were like, ‘What is going on?’ Everybody just booed him. He went from wearing red and yellow to black and white.”\n\nHogan’s infamous switch from beloved hero to villain in the 1990s stunned wrestling fans and redefined his career.\n\nLeBron saw clear parallels when he joined forces with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, a move that instantly made him the league’s most polarising figure.\n\nLeBron explained that accepting the villain label was partly about understanding entertainment as much as competition.\n\n“One, we’re entertainers as well… Listen, we want to go out and have fun, smile and be happy because that’s what brings us joy,” James continued.\n\nHe concluded, stating: “But we can tap into the Joker role if y’all make us, now. We can get there too now, and still be able to perform at a high level.”\n\nDuring his Miami Heat years, James leaned into the boos, the black uniforms, and the perception that he was basketball’s ultimate antagonist.\n\nRather than fighting public sentiment, he channelled it. The result was one of the most dominant stretches of his career, with championships, MVPs, and a sharpened edge that defined a new version of LeBron.\n\nMuch like Hogan’s transformation elevated professional wrestling, LeBron’s embrace of the villain role reshaped the NBA’s modern era. It was controversial, deliberate, and ultimately successful.\n\nLeBron James sends message to Wesley Bryan while explaining his recent golf obsession\n\nDillon Brooks calls LeBron James NBA’s most overrated player to renew rivalry\n\nRich Paul claims LeBron James turned Cleveland into ‘Hollywood of the Midwest’",

    "fullText": "The 2025–26 NBA season delivered a fresh wave of breakout stars, with six players earning their first All-Star selections through sustained growth and undeniable impact. Each of these players took a meaningful leap, either by expanding their offensive responsibilities, anchoring a defense, or becoming indispensable to their team’s identity. Together, they represent the league’s constant evolution and the reward that comes from opportunity meeting preparation.\n\nDeni Avdija breaks new ground as one of the league’s most complete two-way forwards this season. His All-Star nod reflects a career-high scoring uptick and unprecedented playmaking for a Trail Blazers forward, putting him among the rare players averaging 25+ points, 7+ rebounds, and 6+ assists. Beyond the counting stats, Avdija’s selection is historic: he’s the first NBA All-Star from Israel, showcasing his rapid ascent and growing global impact. His versatile game has been a key factor for Portland’s competitiveness this season.\n\nJalen Duren has emerged as a true interior force for the Detroit Pistons, anchoring both ends of the court with energy and efficiency. This first All-Star selection comes as a result of his elite rebounding and inside scoring, where he ranks among the league’s best in key paint-dominant metrics. Duren’s physicality sets the tone for Detroit defensively, and his offensive improvements have made him a reliable secondary scoring option. His trajectory suggests he could become one of the NBA’s premier big men for years to come.\n\nChet Holmgren’s All-Star breakthrough signifies the Thunder’s rise defensively and his unique impact on both ends of the floor. In just his third NBA season, he’s developed into a disruptive rim protector while continuing to expand his scoring and rebounding prowess. Holmgren’s combination of size, agility, and shooting range makes him a matchup problem and a centerpiece of OKC’s identity. His inclusion among the league’s elite this year highlights how integral he’s become to his team’s success\n\nBack at full health after a season cut short by injury, Jalen Johnson has taken a massive leap to become one of the Hawks’ central playmakers. His All-Star selection reflects career-high production across scoring, rebounding, and facilitating, with a rare all-around stat line that puts him in elite company. Johnson’s athleticism and versatility have given Atlanta a multi-dimensional threat on offense and a disruptive presence on defense. This first All-Star appearance underscores his growth into a franchise cornerstone.\n\nJamal Murray’s first All-Star nod comes after years of high-impact performances that previously went unrecognized in the midseason showcase. This season represents a personal best on both ends of the court, where he’s set new marks in scoring, assists, and shooting efficiency. Murray’s knack for clutch play and generating offense has been vital for the Nuggets, especially during stretches without Nikola Jokić. His breakthrough honors reflect the high-level consistency he’s brought to Denver’s lineup.\n\nAt 32 years old, Norman Powell’s first All-Star selection is a testament to perseverance and gradual refinement of his game. In Miami, Powell has become a primary scoring threat, putting up career-best numbers while leading one of the highest-scoring offenses in the league. His sharpshooting and ability to take over games in isolation have made him an X-factor for the Heat. This long-awaited recognition rewards years of hard-earned development and situational excellence.\n\nThese first-time All-Stars didn’t arrive by accident; their selections reflect seasons defined by consistency, resilience, and expanded roles. From young cornerstones announcing their arrival to veterans finally receiving overdue recognition, this group captures multiple paths to All-Star status. As the league continues to shift, the 2025–26 class stands as a snapshot of the NBA’s next phase and the players shaping it.\n\nThe post NBA: First-time All-Stars for 2025-2026 season appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Clippers superstar Kawhi Leonard was considered to be one of the most shocking omission from the 2026 NBA West All-Star roster this season. When the reserve players for both conferences were announced on Sunday, the list did not include Leonard.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Leonard was added to the Western Conference’s roster, according to NBA insider Shams Charania. Leonard is the 16th U.S. All-Star, which is the minimum requirement. The initial group of 24 All-Stars had only 15 U.S. All-Stars.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard has been selected to the 2026 NBA All-Star Game. After the selection of the initial 24 All-Stars, Leonard was added to bring the total number of U.S. All-Stars to 16, the minimum required.\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 3, 2026\n\nLeonard will be a reserve player for the Western Conference alongside the following seven players:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards\n\nDenver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray\n\nOklahoma City Thunder center Chet Holmgren\n\nHouston Rockets forward Kevin Durant\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Devin Booker\n\nPortland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija\n\nThe West Conference starters will be Los Angeles Lakers forward-guard Luka Doncic, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, San Antonio Spurs forward Victor Wembanyama, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokić and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry.\n\nThis is Leonard’s seventh NBA All-Star selection of his career. He is the only Clippers player to have earned an All-Star selection this season.\n\nThe Western Conference is filled with superstars, but Leonard has been one of the top players in the NBA since defeating the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 20. He has led the Clippers out of a 6-21 rut and now the team is 23-26.\n\nAlthough many believed Leonard should have been named an All-Star initially, the two-time NBA champion told reporters he was not expecting to earn the honor after the Clippers’ game against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday.\n\n“It’s never an expectation for me. I was a guy that had to work my way into those conversations. It is what it is. I’m gonna enjoy my time,” Leonard said, per Joey Linn on X.\n\nKawhi Leonard last night on his All-Star snub:\n\n“It’s never an expectation for me.

    "fullText": "The former UVA star picked up right where he left off last season.\n\nAfter missing the first 46 games of the season due to a lingering calf strain, former Virginia Cavaliers star Ty Jerome is finally back in action and already winning over a new fanbase.\n\nIt was a disappointing start to the season for Jerome, who broke out last year with the Cleveland Cavaliers to the tune of 19.9 points and 7.0 assists per game, leading to a third-place finish in the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Voting.\n\nJerome’s impressive campaign earned him a three-year, $27 million deal with the Memphis Grizzlies in July, but his Grind City debut was pushed back until the final day of January for the first of a pair of home games against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe 2019 National Champion has quickly made up for lost time, scoring a team-high 20 points in Saturday’s 131-114 loss before following it up with a 19-point, 8-assist, 6-rebound performance on Monday night in a 137-128 rematch win over the T-Wolves.\n\nDespite playing just 20 minutes in each of his first two appearances for Memphis due to a minutes restriction, Jerome is already bringing stability to a Grizzlies backcourt that has dealt with injuries and inconsistency throughout the season. Jerome is shooting 54.5% from the field while showing off his trademark deliberate pace and elite decision-making as Memphis’s floor general.\n\n“[Jerome] doesn’t look like the most explosive guy, but he gets to his spots on the floor because he reads so well the body language of not only his own defender but also the helping defenders,” said Grizzlies head coach Tuomas Iisalo to the media after Monday night’s win. “He’s actually so good that he can manipulate [defenders] to get out of the space that he wants to create or get into the space that he wants to create for someone else.”\n\nWith Jerome sidelined and several other key players (including 2x All-Star Ja Morant, who has missed 28 games this season) in and out of the lineup, the Grizzlies went just 18-28 in their first 46 games, leaving them currently three games out of the play-in equation in the Western Conference.\n\nIn other pro ’Hoos news, De’Andre Hunter made headlines over the weekend as he was dealt from the Cavaliers to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis ahead of February 5th’s NBA trade deadline.\n\nIt hasn’t been the season that many envisioned for Hunter, who averaged 14.0 points in 43 games this season with Cleveland on 42.3% shooting from the floor and a career-low 30.8% from beyond the arc. But a new home might be exactly what is needed for the 2019 fourth-overall pick. The Kings, which have a league-worst 12 wins this season, are in full-on tank mode, meaning we won’t be seeing Hunter back in the postseason this spring. However, Sacramento could be a perfect spot for the former ’Hoo to become an offensive focal point and once again show the league what he’s capable of in the right environment.",

    "description": "Seems like the Los Angeles Clippers could trade James Harden. Here are some potential landing spots before the NBA trade deadline.",
    "fullText": "James Harden has continued to be a huge help to the Los Angeles Clippers after the team's awful start, but he's sat out the past couple of games. Now? There's word via ESPN's Shams Charania that the Clips and Harden are \"working through whether the sides can find a deal by Thursday's trade deadline.\"\n\nEven at age 36, Harden is still averaging 25.4 ppg, 8.1 apg and 4.8 rpg. His contract situation? He's got a partially guaranteed contract this year and a player option for 2026-27. So that could be a factor for whomever acquires him.\n\nSo where could he go? Here's a list of some possible destinations as the 2026 NBA trade deadline approaches:\n\nThis is the team that's most linked to him, with Darius Garland heading to the Clippers. Why would the Cavs trade a much younger point guard? Well, maybe they think they have a shot at the Eastern Conference this season and perhaps they don't think Garland could be worth the money he could earn soon.\n\nThey need a point guard and someone to take some heat off Anthony Edwards. This is a move that would help a lot given their issues at point guard with an aging Mike Conley.\n\nThis feels like a darkhorse. The Raps have a lot of young talent, but what if they deal someone (RJ Barrett, perhaps?) for Harden and win a playoff series with him? I honestly don't know if the Raptors feel like they need to interrupt the growth they have as a young roster, but on paper, it might make sense.\n\nI saw the most tweets about this one. Harden gets back with Kevin Durant, returns to the team where he broke out as an MVP. Maybe he's happy being back in Houston? If the Rockets want to keep pace in the super-competitive West, this would be the move.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: James Harden landing spots with NBA trade rumors swirling",

    "fullText": "With the NBA trade deadline approaching on Thursday, teams across the league are scrambling to assemble rosters they believe best position them for the future. The Los Angeles Clippers, for their part, are reportedly engaged in serious talks to send James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThis does not appear to be a situation where the Clippers were actively looking to move Harden. He has missed the team’s last two games for personal reasons, and it has long been understood that he carries significant influence over any potential trade destination. In short, Hardenwants a move away from LA.\n\nReports suggest the Cavaliers are willing to send Darius Garland to Inglewood in return, a move that would shift them down a path of youth. However, not everyone is convinced it makes sense for Cleveland, with Emmanuel Acho emerging as one of the more vocal critics of the potential deal.\n\nThe Clippers, after languishing at the bottom of the West for the first few weeks of the 25/26 season, are creeping up the standings and are currently 9th with a 23-26 record. The Cavs, meanwhile, are 5th in the East and looking to rediscover the form that helped them finish #1 in their conference last season. Acho warned them on Speakeasy that signing Harden won’t help them achieve that.\n\n“I would not want James Harden if I were a championship-caliber team,” the former NFL player turned sports pundit declared. “Nothing about James Harden spells Championship. Nothing about James Harden’s career spells Championship. He is all the way over the hill, and James Harden has never been a catalyst for winning championships.”\n\nThese may seem like harsh comments, but Acho has a point. He noted how Harden has never helped a team get close to winning a championship, and the only time a team looked deadly with him in the roster was when he was a 6th man in Oklahoma. He failed to deliver success in Houston (ran into prime Warriors to be fair), Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and finally, Los Angeles.\n\n“When he’s ever had to be that guy, he’s not that,” Acho added. “So, why in the world would anybody want to trade for James Harden if they actually have championship aspirations?”\n\nWell, it looks like Harden has championship aspirations for starters. There’s a reason he’s switched teams so many times in the 2020s. It’s not working out anywhere, but he refuses to give up. He’s averaging 25.4 points per game and assisting 8.1. His playmaking has also significantly improved over the years.\n\nWill teaming up with Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley finally give him the fairytale ending he’s hoping for? We’ll have to wait and see.\n\nThe post “Nothing About James Harden Spells Champion”: Emmanuel Acho Goes Off Following Clippers-Cavaliers Trade Story appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Monday night in the NBA delivered drama in different ways. One team erased a huge deficit. Another leaned on a single star to survive without key players. Long losing streaks ended, and winning streaks came to a stop. Every game shifted the mood in the standings and showed which teams are finding answers and which ones are still searching.\n\nCharlotte earned its seventh straight win after erasing a 22-point deficit. LaMelo Ball showed toughness after a head collision with coach Charles Lee caused an eye cut. He returned quickly and finished with 24 points. Kon Knueppel scored 17 and hit four three-pointers. Brandon Miller and Grant Williams added 16 each. The Hornets survived 17 turnovers and poor three-point shooting in the first half. Ball’s drive and dunk in the fourth gave Charlotte the lead. Miller later stole the ball from Herbert Jones and finished with a one-handed dunk. The win pulled Charlotte within a half-game of Atlanta for the final play-in spot.\n\nNew Orleans could not hold a strong first-half lead. Trey Murphy III led with 27 points. Zion Williamson had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Derik Queen added 16. Ball’s injury did not slow Charlotte enough. Defensive pressure hurt the Pelicans late. The loss marked their sixth defeat in nine games. New Orleans struggled to stop dribble drives in the fourth quarter.\n\nHouston won despite missing Kevin Durant and Steven Adams. Alperen Sengun carried the load with 39 points and 16 rebounds. Jabari Smith Jr. added 19. Sengun made 13 of 25 shots and 13 of 18 free throws. Eight of those free throws came in the fourth quarter. The Rockets used a late 12-2 run to seal the game. A replay decision wiped out a possible Pacers buzzer-beater before halftime and shifted momentum. Houston earned its third straight win and third straight road victory.\n\nIndiana could not finish strong after a comeback push. Pascal Siakam scored 27 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 25. The Pacers briefly led in the third quarter after a fast-break pass from Jarace Walker to Siakam. Sengun’s free throws ended their hopes. The team missed a chance to extend its winning streak to three games. Defensive fouls in the final minutes proved costly.\n\nMemphis snapped a six-game losing streak with sharp shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 30 points. Ty Jerome had 19. Jaylen Wells added 18. Cam Spencer and Vince Williams Jr. scored 16 each. Three-point shooting changed the game after a poor effort two nights earlier. Memphis went 8 of 15 from deep in the first half. A 20-point lead formed in the second half. Early fourth-quarter threes pushed the margin to 20 again. The Grizzlies stayed ahead even when Minnesota tried to rally.\n\nMinnesota could not repeat its strong showing from Saturday. Anthony Edwards led with 39 points and seven rebounds. Jaden McDaniels scored 29. Donte DiVincenzo had 21, including 13 in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves never got closer than nine points late. Their four-game winning streak came to an end. Defensive breakdowns on the perimeter hurt them early.\n\nPhiladelphia stayed hot with a fourth straight win. Tyrese Maxey scored 29 and hit seven three-pointers. Dominick Barlow posted 26 points and 16 rebounds. Joel Embiid added 24 as he worked back from injury. The Sixers led from start to finish and built a 23-point cushion. A 72-53 halftime lead set the tone. The team improved to 11-10 without Paul George. Balanced scoring and steady defense kept control all night.\n\nLos Angeles missed James Harden for a second straight game. Kawhi Leonard led with 29 points. Jordan Miller added 21 off the bench. Short runs in the fourth quarter failed to change the outcome. Leonard finished on the bench as the gap stayed wide. The Clippers remain in the play-in chase but could not match Philadelphia’s energy.\n\nFebruary 2 produced wins that mattered beyond the final score. Charlotte proved it can fight back under pressure. Houston showed it can win even when short-handed. Memphis finally broke through after weeks of frustration. Philadelphia kept its steady climb going. For the losing teams, the night exposed problems with closing games and protecting leads. With the season moving fast, these results could shape who stays alive in the NBA playoff race and who falls behind.\n\nThe post NBA results: February 2, 2026 – winners and losers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "NBA trade deadline tracker: Latest news, rumors for Giannis Antetokounmpo and more in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nList of NBA trades completes at deadline\n\nNBA trade deadline deals by team\n\nWhen is the NBA trade deadline in 2026?\n\nThe NBA trade deadline is undoubtedly among the most engaging moments within the entire sports calendar.\n\nThe Thursday 3 p.m. ET cutoff for trade agreements is expected to spur considerable activity as it approaches.\n\nTeams are required to finalize their rosters by this deadline before the final phase of the regular season. This year's deadline is particularly intense, with numerous high-profile players rumored to be on the trading block.\n\nAs the activity intensifies, The Sporting News will monitor rumors, news, and reported transactions leading up to the deadline. Due to the nature of these deals, some may be announced following the deadline.\n\nContinue to follow this coverage to remain informed of all developments.\n\nFischer adds that the two sides seem resigned to a separation after eight years together, although that is more likely to come in the offseason when James hits free agency.\n\n\"The most aggressive team in the West right now is the Minnesota Timberwolves,\" said Brian Windhorst. \"They are in the game for Giannis, and the Timberwolves are being aggressive. If they don't make what I would call a Hail Mary Giannis deal, I think they are aggressively looking to upgrade their backcourt.\"\n\nShams Charania also appeared on ESPN and shared the same reports that Minnesota is indeed one of the most aggressive teams in the NBA when it comes to acquiring Antetokounmpo.\n\nJackson reported that the Miami Heat are expected to offer an extensive trade package for Antetokounmpo. The offer is anticipated to be Tyler Herro, Kel'el Ware, Terry Rozier, young players, 2 1st-round picks and 3 pick swaps, per Jackson. If the Bucks do happen to acquire Rozier, they will have to pay his entire 25-26 salary.\n\nA day after The Athletic reported that the Knicks are inquiring about Antetokounmpo, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on \"Get Up\" Monday morning that, \"The Knicks believe in this team.. They believed in this team last summer when Giannis was loosely available in those discussions. They didn't make an aggressive offer at the time of those talks. If they want to win a bidding war now, i think its going to take a 3 or 4 team trade.... That is just not happening. They are not showing that aggression to get Giannis right now and I think thats because they like this team.\"\n\nWhile other teams have been mentioned far more often, the Trail Blazers are among the franchises interested in Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Oregonian reports. The report adds that new owner Tom Dundon is ready and willing to take big swings to win, which makes Portland a wild card in the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes even if a deal might cost All-Star Deni Avdija.\n\nThe Kings still have salary cap concerns despite an abysmal 12-39 record, and ESPN reports that has prompted Sacramento explore trades involving Zach LaVine, Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Malik Monk. The Kings acquired De’Andre Hunter from the Cavaliers on Saturday.\n\nThe Knicks are one of the teams inquiring about Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Athletic reports, but the Knicks’ inability to fully match what Milwaukee is demanding — premier young players and high draft picks — is a hurdle.\n\nKnicks big man Karl-Anthony Towns is still a trade candidate despite New York’s recent resurgence, The Athletic reports. Towns hasn’t been extended and reportedly has had some hard feelings ever since his name surfaced in Giannis Antetokounmpo trade talks in the offseason.\n\nThe Knicks have “long been trying to find a new home” for forward Guerschon Yabusele, who has struggled since signing in the offseason. Yabusele could need draft assets attached to him to be dealt, The Athletic reports.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading guard Vit Krejci to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Duop Reath and two future second-round selections. The move gives the Hawks the ability to free up roster space, and Atlanta now possesses seven upcoming second-round picks.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are trading De'Andre Hunter to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis. This transaction involves three teams: the Chicago Bulls acquire Kings forward Dario Saric and two future second-round draft picks. Additionally, the Bulls are waiving guard Jevon Carter to make room for Saric, according to sources. They also acted as a third team and acquired assets to complete the trade.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading four-time NBA All-Star Trae Young to the Washington Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert. The Hawks kick off the trade deadline season with a bang.\n\nCJ McCollum (G) - traded from Wizards\n\nCorey Kispert (F) - traded from Wizards\n\nDuop Reath (C) - traded from Trail Blazers\n\nDario Saric (F) - traded from Kings\n\nDennis Schroder (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nKeon Ellis (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nVit Krejci (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nDe'Andre Hunter (F) - traded from Cavs\n\nTrae Young (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nThe 2026 NBA trade deadline is at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 5.\n\nIt is important to note that the deadline is 3 p.m. ET and whatever corresponding time that is for teams in other time zones.

    "description": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. did not make the 2026 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday and social media reacted to his unexpected snub.",
    "fullText": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. was thought at one point in time to be one of the players that was going to make the All-Star Game for the first time in his career given the season that he's had to this point. In anticipation of Porter being Brooklyn's first All-Star since the 2021-22 season (Kevin Durant), there were plenty of questions asked of the organization regarding the honor, until it was revealed that Porter would not be named an All-Star after all.\n\nOn Sunday, around the same time that the Nets tipped off for what ended up being their 130-77 loss at the Detroit Pistons, it was reported by various insiders that Porter did not make the 2026 Eastern Conference All-Star team as a reserve. While there seemed to be virtual locks to make the team as a reserve, such as Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell and Atlanta Hawks forward Jalen Johnson, Porter was considered by many to be among that group due to his impact on Brooklyn this season.\n\nThe reserves for the East are Mitchell, Johnson, New York Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns, Indiana Pacers forward Pascal Siakam, Miami Heat guard Norman Powell, Toronto Raptors forward Scottie Barnes, and Detroit Pistons center Jalen Duren. Those seven players will join the five starters in Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey, Knicks guard Jalen Brunson, Pistons guard Cade Cunningham, Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, and Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nWow, I really thought Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. was going to the All-Star Game. My guess is that the voting came down to Porter and Pacers forward Pascal Siakam. https://t.co/09uVZSckSk\n\n— Sharif Phillips-Keaton (@SharifKeaton) February 1, 2026\n\nPorter, 27, is having the best season of his career as he is averaging 25.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game while shooting 48.2% from the field and 39.8% from three-point land in 38 appearances. While Brooklyn (13-34) has one of the worst records in the Eastern Conference, part of Porter's case was the fact that the Nets are just 1-9 without him in the lineup, demonstrating his importance to the team.\n\nWhile Porter didn't make the All-Star team despite the push by many to see him be among the players making an All-Star appearance for the first time in their career, that doesn't take away from the fact that he's having a terrific season and he's far from the only snub. Here's how social media reacted to Porter being snubbed from the 2026 NBA All-Star Game:\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is an incredible snub from the All-Star Game.\n\nThe Eastern Conference coaches should be ashamed that they voted based on reputation and/or team record.

    "fullText": "After missing around a month of NBA action, Nikola Jokic returned to the court on January 30th against the Los Angeles Clippers, and he looked a hundred percent like his old self. The only problem was that he didn’t play as long as he normally would, and that irked Charles Barkley.\n\nThe Nuggets won 122-109 against the Clippers, and Jokic scored 31 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. It was business as usual for the Joker, whose return will only bolster the Denver Nuggets’ post-season hopes. The crowd and pundits seemed to miss seeing Jokic’s greatness on display, which is why Barkleybizarrely called for David Adelman’s head for limiting the Serbian’s minutes.\n\nJokic‘s incredible stat line was a result of just 25 minutes of basketball action. Barkley feels — and rightly so — that he could have done a lot more. The punishment for Adelman? Fire him.\n\n“I gotta call out coach Adelman,” Barkley said on ESPN. “He gave this guy 25 minutes; he would have had 40… We gotta get rid of coach Adelman. He holding this dude back.”\n\n“This dude should have had 40-15-7… He can’t even get his triple-double on cuz he played half the game,” the Round Mound of Rebounds added.\n\nOf course, he was joking. No coach would be fired simply for restricting their star player’s minutes, especially after returning from a long-term injury. Jokic missed 16 games with a knee injury he suffered on December 29. Now, he is back and will slowly, but surely, play more minutes to satisfy Barkley and others.\n\nThe Nuggets looked fine without Jokic as well, which makes them an even scarier team. They went 10-6 in his absence, establishing themselves as a genuine contender in the Western Conference.\n\nUnfortunately, Jokic’s second game back was not as impressive. He scored just 16 points, grabbed seven rebounds, and recorded eight assists in a 121–111 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the top team in the NBA. He played four more minutes than he did against the Clippers, which once again shows that Adelmandoes not want to risk losing his best player to injury again this season.\n\nThe post Charles Barkley Jokingly Calls for Nuggets HC to Be Fired After “Holding” Nikola Jokic Back vs. Clippers appeared first on The SportsRush.",

While they were expected to be deadline sellers coming into the season, they’ve wildly surpassed expectations, going 31-18 and ranking second in net rating.\n\nAccordingly, the Celtics are more likely to be buyers than sellers this week given their place in the standings. However, they could still look to offload a player or two to clear up some payroll and open a spot for Jayson Tatum’s expected return.\n\nGiven the rumors and uncertainty, the trade deadline is always a stressful and anxious time for players, coaches and executives alike. Anything can happen.\n\nPrior to Sunday’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks, Joe Mazzulla revealed how he’s handling it this year.\n\nJoe Mazzulla emphasizes adhering to routine when asked about handling the days leading up to the trade deadline:\n\n“You just stick to the process every day.” pic.twitter.com/Kav4aJiviC\n\n— Bobby Krivitsky (@BobbyKrivitsky) February 1, 2026\n\n“You just stick to the process every day, what gives you a chance to win that particular day,” Mazzulla said during his pregame press conference. “Maximize the day. Is it a game day? Is it an off day? Is it a day where we gotta come in and watch film? Is it a day that we gotta practice? You just have to understand what day you’re at and make sure you put your focus on that.”\n\nThat type of focus should serve Mazzulla and his players well over the next few days. After destroying the Bucks on Sunday, they’re off on Monday before traveling to Texas for a back-to-back against the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets. Then they’re off on Thursday, the day of the deadline.\n\nMazzulla doesn’t get distracted easily, so look for him to stay locked in and keep his team prepared over the next few days as they look to get off to a strong start in February.\n\nJoe Mazzulla Reflects On Celtics Legacy Ahead Of NBA Pioneers Classic",

This accomplishment surpasses all previous teenage records in NBA history.\n\nOn January 29, 2026, Flagg set a new NBA record for points scored by a teenager in a single game, erupting for 49 points in a 123-121 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nFlagg was exceptionally efficient, shooting 20-of-29 (69%) from the field and a perfect 6-of-6 from the free-throw line. This performance surpassed the previous teenage scoring record of 45 points set by Cliff Robinson in 1980.\n\nEarlier in the season, on December 15, 2025, Flagg had already broken LeBron James' specific record for an 18-year-old by scoring 42 points against the Utah Jazz. James' record was 37 points and it was set in 2003.\n\nTwo days after his record-breaking 49-point game, Flagg continued his historic rookie run on January 31, 2026, recording 34 points and 12 rebounds in a 111-107 loss to the Houston Rockets.\n\nPlaying 39 minutes, the 6-foot-9 forward shot 52% (13-of-25) and became the first teenager in NBA history to achieve consecutive 30-point double-doubles.\n\nFlagg scored 30 points for the fifth time this season, including 22 points in the first quarter alongside Brandon Williams, helping Dallas stay competitive after an early deficit.\n\nThe teenager scored a total of 83 points in two games, an unprecedented achievement for any player under 20.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA All-Star game is changing once again.\n\nThe league has tinkered with different formats throughout the past few years, trying to inject excitement into a game that has lost its luster. Their latest change is the most dramatic. This year's game will feature a theme of America versus the World. The hope is that it adding an element of national pride will lead to more competitive play.\n\nNOH: My projected All-Star reserves for 2026\n\nThis year's game will feature a round robin tournament between two American teams and one World team. Each team will consist of at least eight players. Participants from both the Eastern and Western conference will be mixed among all three teams.\n\nIn the event that the 24 All-Stars are not divided evenly between 16 Americans and eight international players, commissioner Adam Silver will select players to the game until each team can field at least eight players. That may result in some teams that have more players than others.\n\nThere will be four games in total played, with each game lasting 12 minutes. In the round-robin tournament, Team A will play Team B in Game 1.  The winning team from Game 1 will take on Team C in Game 2, followed by the losing team of Game 1 meeting Team C in Game 3.\n\nAfter Game 3, the top two teams by record will advance to face each other in the championship game (Game 4).  If all three teams have a 1-1 record after Game 3, the tiebreaker would be point differential in each team’s two round-robin games.\n\nMORE: The 11 worst contracts in the NBA, based on my salary tool\n\nThe reserves will be announced on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nThe starters, who will be divided up among the three teams (two American, one World), have been announced and are as follows:\n\nAll-Star Weekend will take place from Friday, Feb. 13 to Sunday, Feb. 15.

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nBrooks was a guest on Twitch streamer N3on’s broadcast, as the duo drove around Phoenix and Brooks showed the streamer the Suns’ locker room and practice facility. At one point, N3on posed the question to Brooks, who answered without hesitation.\n\n“I would probably say Lebron [James] right now,” the Suns guard said. “I feel like he overrated right now, his time is coming to an end.”\n\nNeedless to say, the remark quickly went viral online. Within hours, Brooks’ honesty was met with a flurry of reactions from fans.\n\nThe comment marks another chapter in the rivalry Brooks and James have found themselves in this season. Both players have had their fair share of exchanges during games between the Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe most notable came in a Dec. 14 thriller, when the two spent much of the night jawing at each other before Brooks was ultimately ejected in the closing seconds after receiving his second technical foul following a confrontation with James after hitting a go-ahead 3-pointer.\n\nPhoenix would eventually fall to Los Angeles, 116-114.\n\nDec 1, 2025; Los Angeles, California, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) moves the ball against Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks (3) during the first half at Crypto.com Arena. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nAs a defining figure in the league for more than two decades, James has been one of the most accomplished players in NBA history. However, Brooks’ comments suggest he views James strictly as an on-court rival, regardless of his accolades.\n\nThe moment also reinforces Brooks’ reputation as an unapologetic edge-setter for the Suns. His confrontational persona has resonated with the fan base and, while it has occasionally led to foul trouble, it has also helped fuel Phoenix to much-needed wins and momentum.\n\nDec 14, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks (3) and Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) react during an altercation that resulted in a technical for Brooks during the second half of a game at the Mortgage Matchup Center.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPayton Pritchard is among the most underrated No. 3 scoring options in the league.\n\nThe 6-foot-1 Boston Celtics guard has done nothing but improve his game since entering the league in 2020, and with Jayson Tatum sidelined with an Achilles injury, he’s received a more significant offensive role with the 2024 NBA champions.\n\nAccording to the X/Twitter account 'Real App, ' Payton currently leads the NBA in an impressive stat.\n\n“Payton Pritchard has the most games in the NBA this season with 25+ points & zero free throws attempted,” the notable statistics-based account stated.\n\nWhy is that stat so admirable? Well, it’s common for players to erupt for 25+ points while attempting multiple free throws. In some cases, it’s so extreme that fans will throw out terms like ‘foul baiter’ and ‘free throw merchant’ to help diminish a player’s performance.\n\nWhen an individual doesn’t get any whistles in a 25-point outing, it means they had no choice but to fight through contact and score at a high clip. Pritchard has done just that this season, helping the Celtics navigate life without Tatum.\n\nPritchard is averaging 17.0 points, 5.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game this year, shooting 45.9% from the field and 35.3% from downtown. The Celtics will need Pritchard to remain consistent if they want to return to the NBA Finals.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors predicted to cut ties with Jonathan Kuminga, acquire $108 million two-time blocks leader",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStill, moves are expected to happen. Two of the biggest names that could be out the door by next Thursday include, but aren't limited to, Lonzo Ball and DeAndre Hunter. Right now, both men have seemingly worn out their welcome in Cleveland, and in order for the Cavs to get under the second apron comfortably, both men would likely have to be moved.\n\nLuckily for the Cavs, GM Mike Gansey has done a good job of building out some young players to make moves like this possible. The rise of Jaylon Tyson, the development of Craig Porter, and the unexpected boost that rookie Tyrese Proctor have given the Cavs this season have made Hunter and Ball expendable. Which is good, because neither man is going to fetch you that much back in a trade.\n\nIdeally, the Cavs trading Hunter and Ball away for nothing, or maybe a second-round pick in a future draft, would be ideal. That would get the Cavs under the second apron and allow them to make more moves in the future. Plus, the team has enough talent on its roster right now to try to contend without additional players coming back. These moves would also help the Cavs land LeBron James in the near future, assuming he wants to return to Cleveland to finish out his career.\n\nSo the trade rumors persist, and three of them have gotten the most traction, so let's look at them.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers acquire F DeAndre Hunter\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers acquire F Rui Hachimura and F Dalton Knecht\n\nAccording to Cleveland.com's Chris Fedor, this is a trade that's been talked about but doesn't seem to have much legs at the moment. The goal here is Knecht. Keeping Hachimura would be nice; he's a solid big man who can play a variety of positions, but his contract isn't appealing, and he doesn't offer much more than anyone on the Cavs roster currently. Sending Hachimura to a team like the Brooklyn Nets would be nice, as you as they can eat his salary, but that seems unlikely at the moment. Knecht makes it possible for the Cavs to move on from Max Strus in the offseason, saving the team even more money. That is, assuming Knecht can show some potential with the Cavs this season.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings acquire F DeAndre Hunter \nThe Cleveland Cavaliers acquire G Keon Ellis, G  Dennis Schroder, and Dario Saric.\n\nThe prior trade with the Lakers seems like a salary dump waiting to happen; this Kings trade seems like the opposite. While HoopsHype's Michael Scotto seems to believe that Ellis is the goal for the Cavs, they would be wise to consider keeping Schroder as well. The guard is everything the Cavs were hoping Lonzo Ball would be. He's a decent scorer still, and while not a stud by any means, he'd be a fine enough addition to the Cavs as a backup for Darius Garland. He's in the first year of a three-year deal that'll pay him between $14 and $15 million a year, so he may not be the guy you want to keep around past this season, but he could fill a need in the wake of the failure of Ball's trade if you don't trust Porter or Proctor yet.\n\nThe Washington Wizards get G Lonzo Ball\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers get TBD\n\nIt may not seem like much of a trade, but as reports have pointed out, Lonzo Ball is 460th in shooting percentage out of 450 eligible players. He's washed, and the thought of giving up Isaac Okoro for him in a trade makes some fans a little ill to this day. The Washington Wizards know that the Cavs wanna dump Ball's salary so that the Cavs have wiggle room for the trade deadline. So they're offering to take Ball off the Cavs ' hands, for a nominal fee. They want draft capital in return, according to HoopsHype Scotto. A fair offer, but it seems unlikely the Cavs would give up a first-round pick to get rid of Ball, so this could be a situation where Ball and two second-round picks head over to the Wizards for a second-round pick of their own. It's a bold move, but one that would get the Cavs closer to being under the second apron.",

    "fullText": "Paul George suspension: 76ers forward to miss 25 games for violating NBA's anti-drug policy originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA announced a stunning 25-game suspension for Philadelphia 76ers star forward Paul George following a violation of the league’s anti-drug policy. The suspension, which begins immediately, will cost the nine-time All-Star approximately $11.7 million in lost salary and sideline him during a critical stretch as the 76ers battle for playoff seeding in the Eastern Conference.\n\nIn a statement released to ESPN, George expressed remorse, citing a mistake made while seeking treatment for his personal well-being. He said he took an improper medication during that process and accepted full responsibility for the decision, apologizing to his teammates, the organization, and fans. George, who is averaging 16 points per game this season, is not expected to be eligible to return until March 25 against the Chicago Bulls, leaving him with only 10 games remaining in the regular season.\n\nHere are more details on George’s suspension.\n\nMORE: Paul George's suspension will cost the 76ers star 8 figures from contract\n\nGeorge was suspended for violating the terms of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program.\n\nBreaking: 76ers forward Paul George has been suspended 25 games for violating the league's anti-drug policy, the NBA announced. pic.twitter.com/vVVn7niPGW\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 31, 2026\n\n“Over the past few years, I’ve discussed the importance of mental health, and in the course of recently seeking treatment for an issue of my own, I made the mistake of taking an improper medication,\" George said in a statement to ESPN. \"I take full responsibility for my actions and apologize to the Sixers organization, my teammates and the Philly fans for my poor decision making during this process.\"\n\nMORE: Lakers have the weirdest LeBron-Luka problem\n\nGeorge will be suspended for 25 games, starting with Saturday's game against the Pelicans.\n\nHe is projected to be eligible to return on March 25 for a home game against the Chicago Bulls, leaving him with just 10 games remaining in the regular season.\n\n“I am focused on using this time to make sure that my mind and body are in the best condition to help the team when I return,” George said.\n\nDuring his 25-game suspension, Paul George will miss a substantial portion of the regular season, including several high-stakes matchups against Eastern Conference rivals.\n\nMORE: 76ers facing a $149 million Joel Embiid contract nightmare\n\nThe NBA released a short statement on George.\n\nThe following was released by the NBA: pic.twitter.com/hveY31Fzpg\n\n— NBA Communications (@NBAPR) January 31, 2026\n\nThe 25-game suspension is usual for first-time violators.\n\nMORE: Donovan Mitchell tied a LeBron James record with the Cavs\n\nGeorge sent in his own statement to ESPN, per Shams Charania.\n\n\"Over the past few years, I’ve discussed the importance of mental health, and in the course of recently seeking treatment for an issue of my own, I made the mistake of taking an improper medication.

    "description": "Former Clipper Quentin Richardson discusses the format change, what to expect during All-Star Weekend and how much the annual events mean to him and other players.",
    "fullText": "The NBA All-Star Game is returning to the Southland in two weeks and a part of the annual weekend event that has grown in popularity in recent years is the Rising Stars Challenge, which affords fans the opportunity to watch the league’s top rookies and second-year players compete in a four-team tournament.\n\nRosters for the mini-tournament to take place on Friday, Feb. 13, at Intuit Dome were drafted this week by a trio of Hall of Famers in Carmelo Anthony, Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter, who will join former NBA player and current NBC/Peacock analyst Austin Rivers as the four honorary coaches (Rivers will coach the G League squad).\n\nAnthony had the No. 1 pick and drafted Dallas rookie forward Cooper Flagg. McGrady went next and chose Charlotte rookie guard/forward Kon Knueppel while Carter opted for Philadelphia rookie guard VJ Edgecombe at No. 3. (Rosters attached at bottom of story.)\n\nQuentin Richardson, drafted by the Clippers with the 18th pick of the 2000 NBA draft, knows all three Hall of Famers well. He was Anthony’s teammate on the New York Knicks in 2012-13 and faced cousins McGrady and Carter many times throughout their respective careers. Richardson, now 45, enjoys All-Star Weekend and is delighted to see the festivities back in the city where his NBA journey started. A highlight of his 13-year career was making his last nine shots to win the three-point contest in 2005.\n\n“I participated in the Saturday night rookie-sophomore game my first couple of years in the league and I just love the event,” said Richardson, who played for the Clippers from 2000 to 2004 when they were co-tenants with the Lakers at what was then called Staples Center, now Crypto.com Arena. “It’s a platform for the fans to look at the real future stars of the league, the up-and-comers, and with the international boom there’s so many different young international guys they may not know well from different teams that are out on display that weekend.\n\n“It’s one of those weekends you always want to go to, you always want to be a part of.\"\n\nThe Rookie Challenge was established in 1994 and featured two randomly selected teams of first-year players. The name was changed to Rising Stars Challenge in 2012 and the current tournament-style format was adopted four years ago. Since 2023, the format has been 28 players — 21 rookies and sophomores and seven G League players.\n\n“I’m intrigued by the format,” Richardson said. “When I played it was just the rookies and sophomores, two teams, but the kids have gotten behind this so the NBA has been very good about pivoting into different things to try to gain more excitement around the games for that weekend. I’m all for it.”\n\n“It’ll be awesome [at Intuit Dome],” said Richardson, who lives in Orlando and co-hosts the \"Knuckleheads\" podcast with Darius Miles. “The young fellas will be put on display for the world to see and that venue is going to be put on display for everyone to see as well. I believe it’s the newest arena we have in the NBA. So much technology went into it, so it’ll be a great stage for everyone to come and witness and enjoy that.”\n\nRichardson, Miles and Keyon Dooling starred in the 2004 documentary \"The Youngest Guns\" about their first three seasons with the Clippers. Richardson hosts NBA HooperVision in addition to the pregame, halftime and postgame shows for the Magic.\n\n“The rules have changed in a way that you’re allowing the fans to watch more scoring,” he said. “The pace has been sped up, the three-point shot is a bigger deal now, they shoot it with a higher volume. From a fan’s standpoint you want to see more scoring and more defense, but the defenders now have that much more skill because they don’t have as many rules in their favor.”\n\nIn the Rising Stars mini-tournament, Team A will face Team B in the first semifinal and Team C will play Team D in the second semifinal. The two winners will meet for the championship. For each semifinal, the first team to reach or surpass 40 points is the winner. For the final, the first team to reach or surpass 25 points will be the champion.\n\n“I like how they draft for it,” Richardson said. “It picks from the essence of how we all grew up when you played in the park or rec league, wherever you went, one guy had two dudes to choose and you get to pick your five, so it’s kind of taking you back to the essence of how we grew up playing ball. It’s something we’re all familiar with so that’s a little twist that takes us back to our roots.”\n\nIn November, the NBA announced that the All-Star Game will adopt a new USA vs. the World format: a round-robin tournament featuring two teams of American players and another of international players, each consisting of at least eight players. The top two teams based on record will advance to the finals. All four games will be played with a 12-minute time limit.\n\n“Absolutely, it’ll continue to be a global sport,” Richardson said. “Especially with them talking about NBA Europe, that’ll make everything bigger and better. They’ve got the Africa League so from commissioner David Stern to now Adam Silver they’ve done an incredible job of growing the brand. Proof is in the amount of international guys we have in the league now. It’s known far and wide and it’ll continue to get bigger and bigger.”\n\nRichardson thinks the success of the All-Star Game is dependent on the best players participating.\n\n“It just takes a couple of guys … one or two of the right guys to come out and participate,” he said. \"When a couple guys do it, I think you’ll see the turn. The three-point contest, the dunk contest, it’ll take one big-name guy to go out and do it and everyone else will say, ‘Oh wait, he’s doing it? I need to do it.’ It’ll get back there. It’s a great weekend for the NBA … it’s like a family reunion. I just go out there and enjoy it.”\n\nCooper Flagg (Dallas), Reed Sheppard (Houston), Stephon Castle (San Antonio), Dylan Harper (San Antonio), Jeremiah Fears (New Orleans), Donovan Clingan (Portland), Collin Murray-Boyles (Toronto)\n\nKon Knueppel (Charlotte), Kel’el Ware (Miami), Tre Johnson (Washington), Alex Sarr (Washington), Ajay Mitchell (Oklahoma City), Jaylon Tyson (Cleveland), Cam Spencer (Memphis)\n\nVJ Edgecombe (Philadelphia), Derik Queen (New Orleans), Kyshawn George (Washington), Matas Buzelis (Chicago), Egor Dёmin (Brooklyn), Cedric Coward (Memphis), Jaylen Wells (Memphis)\n\nSean East II (Salt Lake City), Ron Harper Jr. (Maine), David Jones Garcia (Austin), Yanic Konan Niederhäuser (San Diego), Alijah Martin (Raptors 905), Tristen Newton (Rio Grande Valley), Yang Hansen (Rip City)\n\n4 p.m.: Celebrity Game at Kia Forum (ESPN)\n\n6 p.m.: Rising Stars Challenge (Peacock)\n\n8 p.m.: HBCU Classic, Hampton vs. North Carolina A&T, at Kia Forum (Peacock)\n\n10:30 a.m.: NBA All-Star media session (NBA TV)\n\n2 p.m.: All-Star Saturday: skills challenge, three-point contest, slam-dunk contest (NBC and Peacock)\n\n11:30 a.m.: NBA G League Next Up Game at Convention Center (NBA TV)\n\n2 p.m.: 75th NBA All-Star Game (NBC and Peacock)\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Tyrese Maxey spreads the wealth as we break down Pelicans vs. 76ers picks, odds, and expert predictions for Saturday, January 31.",
    "fullText": "The buzz is building around what a healthy Philadelphia 76ers team could do in the second half of the season, and they can pad their record tonight against the 13-37 New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nBut Philadelphia had to mount a late comeback to dodge a stumble against the Sacramento Kings on Thursday and it also takes a hit with Paul George sidelined by suspension, leaving my Pelicans vs. 76ers predictions leaning on Tyrese Maxey needing to put on his cape again here.\n\nGet a closer look at this January 31 clash with my free NBA picks and betting angles.\n\nPelicans vs 76ers best bet: Tyrese Maxey Over 7.5 assists (+110)\n\nAfter carrying the Philadelphia 76ers offense for large chunks of this season, it must be a nice luxury for Tyrese Maxey to have co-stars to lean on.\n\nWith Joel Embiid back on the floor — and even after losing Paul George for an extended stretch due to a 25-game suspension — the 76ers still shape up as a dangerous playoff threat, and it all hinges on Maxey’s ability to wreak havoc on opposing defenses.\n\nFor tonight’s matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans, I’m looking past Maxey’s scoring and targeting his playmaking instead. He’s averaging 6.9 assists per game this year, just outside the Top 10 in the NBA, but there’s a much higher ceiling for this prop these days with a healthier roster around him.\n\nMaxey has nailed this Over in five of his last eight outings, and he’s averaged 8 APG in that span. That’s a reflection of several key developments, including VJ Edgecombe’s continued rise and, most of all, Maxey’s ability to set up Embiid in the pick and roll.\n\nWith Embiid crushing opponents in the mid-range, a chunk of Maxey’s dimes stem from that play, and it’s asking a lot for Zion Williamson or Derik Queen to make the right reads.\n\nI’m grabbing the slight plus odds here, especially with the length of Herb Jones shifting Maxey from scorer to passer at times.\n\nThe Pelicans have shown some fight lately, and they’ve covered the spread in four straight outings. With the 76ers making hard work of their home date with the Kings earlier this week, I’m taking the points here and trusting Zion and Co. to keep this one close.\n\nSaddiq Bey has been on a steals hot streak, with at least one swipe in each of his past six games, and he snared three steals on Friday against the Grizzlies. With Embiid still a little limited with his movement, he’s a turnover candidate, and that’s where Bey could pounce.\n\nZion Williamson has nailed this Over in four straight games, and he’s even finished with a double-digit rebounds tally in three of those outings.\n\nAn active Zion performance is a must if New Orleans is going to hang around in this matchup.\n\nZion Williamson Over 6.5 rebounds\n\nSpread: New Orleans +8.5 (-110) | Philadelphia -8.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: New Orleans +230 | Philadelphia -280\n\nOver/Under: Over 232 (-110) | Under 232 (-110)\n\nThe Pelicans are 28-22 ATS this season.

    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets look flawed.\n\nMissing Fred VanVleet has been a problem all season, but if they’ve unlocked Kevin Durant, those flaws suddenly become more manageable. Leaning on Durant against the Dallas Mavericks makes a lot of sense.\n\nMy Mavericks vs. Rockets predictions trust Durant.\n\nRead \n\nMavericks vs Rockets best bet: Kevin Durant Over 25.5 points (-112)\n\nThe Houston Rockets have leaned on Kevin Durant \n\nThat has directly led to Durant clearing this prop in four of those five games, averaging 31.2 points per game in this stretch.\n\nFor that matter, Durant has scored at least 31 points in four of those games, the exception being a mere 24 points against the Spurs.\n\nSan Antonio has the best defender in the league for Durant. That exception can prove this new rule.\n\nHouston is trusting Durant in a way it probably always should have. His increased workload makes the value of this prop clear ahead of tonight's matchup with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nDurant has cleared this 3-pointers prop in four of his last five games, taking eight attempts per outing. Over his previous 39 games, he averaged 5.5 attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nThis aligns with an Under play more than you might expect, given how deliberate Durant’s possessions can be. Houston has also come up short of the total in each of its last four contests.\n\nDallas’s backcourt is ripe to be exposed. Klay Thompson is not a defensive presence at this point in his career.\n\nA couple of open looks for Reed Sheppard should keep the Mavs’ defense honest, thus leaving more space open for Durant.\n\nSpread: Mavericks +10.5 (-110) | Rockets -10.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Mavericks +375 | Rockets -500\n\nOver/Under: Over 223 (-110) | Under 223 (-110)\n\nHouston’s last four games have all cashed their Unders, and by an average of 16.25 points.

He’s jumped up to 39.7% shooting from distance, and hit his 100th career 3-pointer against the Jazz Friday.\n\nIn the first quarter of Friday’s game, he shot 3 of 5 from deep and then kept it going, finishing with a career high 25 points and 10 rebounds for his first career double-double.\n\nHe finished with six 3-pointers Friday night, shooting 6 of 12.\n\nHe said there’s been no magical fix for his shot outside of just consistent work.\n\n“Shooting the ball, pretty much as simple as it is,” Dëmin said. “Just being in the gym and shooting the ball.”\n\nEgor Dёmin for 👌\n\nHe now has a 3PM in 34 consecutive games, the longest streak for ANY ROOKIE in NBA history! pic.twitter.com/tSeJUwOQGL\n\nDëmin caught up with the media ahead of Friday night’s game, and he spoke about his experience in the NBA, playing at BYU and what it’s meant to him to return to Utah.\n\n“It feels awesome. Super excited to be back here,“ Dëmin said. “Obviously, expecting a lot of BYU colors tonight. Just super grateful to be back here.”\n\nHe also said he had roughly 30 people show up for him for Friday’s game. Many of them were from his BYU circles.\n\n“It’s a lot of (the) culture about BYU,” Dëmin said. “A lot of people know how united the BYU organization is in general. Not just basketball, or just football, or whatever it is, but the whole sports together.\n\n“I’ve been lucky enough to end up in that school and gain so many friends and so many people around me who want the best for me and who I want (the) best for, so it’s just super exciting to be a part of that big BYU family.”\n\nDëmin also spoke highly of BYU head coach Kevin Young. When Young was hired by the Cougars, the main selling point was that he could turn BYU into a place where players could come to develop an NBA-level game.\n\nDëmin was the first of the Young era to make good on that claim, and he’s done so with encouraging numbers. He’s started in 34 games this year for the Nets and will be a participant in the NBA’s Rising Stars game.\n\nReppin’ Brooklyn in this year’s NBA Rising Stars Game: EGOR DËMIN 🌟 pic.twitter.com/pNOvCM95NJ\n\n— Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) January 26, 2026\n\n“He’s an NBA coach, so he taught me in this one year basically whatever I have to know to be able to play in the NBA level,” Dëmin said of Young. “Maybe not even as much of a skill set-wise, because at the end of the day, you get to the league and you just be yourself. That’s kind of the goal.\n\n“He taught a lot of knowledge, (like) that I come here and I’m ready to play, and I know what we’re doing, and I have an idea of what it is. He gave me this kind of base of an NBA player, to be able to come here and know what’s going on around me.”",

    "fullText": "Saturday’s NBA slate packs in six games with playoff energy and clear betting angles. From Charlotte’s hot streak against San Antonio to Houston hosting an injury-hit Dallas side, every matchup has a story behind it. Some teams rely on rebounding, others on star scorers, and a few are just trying to survive tough stretches. Here is a closer look at who holds the edge and why these games matter. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Spectrum Center, Charlotte\n\nCharlotte enters this game riding a five-game winning streak. The Hornets have been strong on the glass, ranking near the top of the East in rebounding at 45.7 per game. Moussa Diabate leads them with 8.4 rebounds. San Antonio also rebounds well at 46.3 per game, with Luke Kornet setting the pace.\n\nVictor Wembanyama continues to anchor the Spurs with 24.3 points and 11.2 rebounds per game. Miles Bridges leads Charlotte at 18.5 points, while Brandon Miller has averaged 23.4 points over the last 10 games.\n\nRecent form favors Charlotte slightly. Over the last 10 games, the Hornets average 116.5 points and allow only 107.4. San Antonio has scored 110.7 in the same span. Home momentum and the +4.5 line make Charlotte the safer side.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Indianapolis\n\nIndiana struggles in blowout games and owns an 8-24 record in the East. Still, the Pacers play closer games at home. Andrew Nembhard averages 17.4 points and 7.4 assists, while Pascal Siakam has scored 20.8 per game over the last 10.\n\nAtlanta is 12-17 against conference teams and recently beat Indiana 132-116. Onyeka Okongwu leads the Hawks with 16.3 points and 7.9 rebounds. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has added 19.7 points per game over the last 10.\n\nThe Pacers shoot only 44.3 percent this season, but Atlanta allows 47.5 percent to opponents. With a short spread and home court edge, Indiana has a narrow path to control the pace.\n\nPredicted winner: Indiana Pacers\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nNew Orleans comes in at 12-37 and allows 121.2 points per game. Defense has been the main issue. The Pelicans still rebound well at 44 per game and force nearly 15 turnovers. Zion Williamson remains their focal point, averaging 21 points in the last outing with 11 rebounds.\n\nPhiladelphia is 25-21 and just beat Milwaukee 139-122. Paul George scored 32 in that win. The 76ers average 116.6 points but sit near the bottom of the league in shooting efficiency at 45.8 percent.\n\nThe Pelicans allow 48.3 percent shooting, which keeps games close late. A large spread gives New Orleans room to stay competitive even if they do not lead for long stretches.\n\nPredicted winner: New Orleans Pelicans\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nMinnesota holds a 29-19 record and ranks fifth in scoring at 119 points per game. Julius Randle just dropped 31 points in a win over Dallas. The Timberwolves shoot 48.1 percent and allow only 114.1 points.\n\nMemphis sits at 18-27 and struggles offensively at 45.4 percent shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 26 in the last game, but team rebounding remains an issue. The Grizzlies were outworked on the boards by Charlotte in their last loss.\n\nThe Timberwolves force turnovers and defend the three well at 35.2 percent allowed. With better balance on both ends, Minnesota should control the matchup.\n\nPredicted winner: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nChicago enters after three straight losses but still averages 118.7 points over the last 10 games. Nikola Vucevic posts 17 points and 9.1 rebounds, while Coby White leads fast-break scoring.\n\nMiami has gone 6-4 in its last 10 and scores 121.3 points per game in that span. Bam Adebayo averages 18 points and shoots 44.5 percent. The Heat won the last meeting 116-113.\n\nThe Bulls shoot 47.6 percent this season, slightly higher than what Miami allows. With a +5.5 line, Chicago can stay within range even if Miami controls the fourth quarter.\n\nPredicted winner: Chicago Bulls\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nDallas is 19-29 and missing key players like Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis. Cooper Flagg has been productive, but the Mavericks give up 116.7 points per game.\n\nHouston stands at 29-17 and thrives when limiting turnovers. Kevin Durant averages 26.5 points, while Alperen Sengun adds steady scoring inside. The Rockets allow only 110 points per game, which ranks among the league’s best marks.\n\nDallas won the last meeting, but the injury list has grown. Houston’s defense and depth give them a strong edge at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nThese six games shape a busy Saturday card. Charlotte and Indiana look strong at home. Minnesota and Houston hold the clearest advantages. New Orleans and Chicago bring value due to large spreads. Each matchup carries a different style of play, which should make January 31 a full night of competitive basketball.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 31: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

St. Brown is from Anaheim Hills, California, and starred at USC for three seasons before being selected by the Lions in the fourth round of the 2021 NFL Draft.\n\nAllen also spent his college years in California, playing three seasons for the Cal Golden Bears before being drafted by the Chargers in 2013. Allen has also spent 12 of his 13 seasons with the Chargers, first in San Diego and then in Los Angeles after their relocation.\n\nSt. Brown is coming off his fourth straight 1,000-yard season and finished the year with 117 catches for 1,401 yards and 11 touchdowns. While the 26-year-old receiver had a great year statistically, the Lions missed the playoffs for the first time in two seasons and finished fourth in the NFC North division. St. Brown will also take part in Sunday's NFL Pro Bowl and was a second-team All-Pro.\n\nIn his first year back with the Chargers after a season with the Chicago Bears, Allen remained productive. The 33-year-old receiver led the team with 81 receptions and had 777 yards and 4 touchdowns. Allen's season ended with a 16-3 wild-card loss to the New England Patriots, which resulted in the firing of former offensive coordinator Greg Roman. Allen is set to become a free agent this offseason.\n\nThe Celebrity game will be on Friday, Feb. 13, and will be held on the first day of All-Star Weekend.",

The Boston Celtics All-Star has spearheaded Joe Mazzulla's roster to a top-three spot in the Eastern Conference, while also being a perennial top-five MVP candidate and an All-Star selection.

He's leading the Celtics in usage rate, shot attempts and free-throw attempts while also playing some stellar defense on the perimeter. Brown has proven that he can be the leading star on a high-level team.\n\nIn a recent video from the \"GOAT\" YouTube channel, the host dives into Brown's recent production, where his buckets are coming from, and why the rest of the league should be taking note.

    "fullText": "Can Nikola Jokic still win NBA MVP after extended absence due to knee injury? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter over a month on the sideline, Denver Nuggets star center Nikola Jokic will return to game action against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night.\n\nJokic suffered a hyperextended left knee during Denver’s 147-123 loss to the Miami Heat on Dec. 29 and has been sidelined since. His return is good news for the Nuggets, and basketball fans in general.\n\nPrior to going down with the injury, Jokic was considered a leading candidate for the NBA MVP award, which he has won three times previously in his career. However, his extended absence brought his candidacy into question.\n\nA while back, the NBA instituted a 65-game threshold for award and All-NBA team eligibility, meaning players had to play at least 65 games in order to be eligible to be considered for awards that season.\n\nMore: Denver Nuggets rebuffing trade offers for key rotation piece\n\nSo, let’s do a little math for a minute. Jokic has missed 16 total games so far this season. That means he’s technically still eligible for award consideration, but barely.\n\nJokic can only miss one (1) more game for the entire season to remain eligible. If he misses two more, that would bring his total to 18 for the season, and 18 subtracted from 82 equals 64 – one shy of the required number. Denver has 34 games remaining on their regular season slate.\n\nAt the end of the day though, hitting that 65-game threshold isn’t going to be the priority for Jokic or the Nuggets. Jokic’s health, both in the short-term and long-term, will be. If Denver’s medical staff thinks Jokic would benefit from a night off, they’re not going to play him solely so he can remain award eligible. Doing so would be organizational malpractice.\n\nPlus, Jokic already has more accolades than most players could ever imagine, and knowing him, he’s not pressed to add to his collection.\n\nKevin Durant passes Dirk Nowitzki on NBA all-time scoring list\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers star shuts down dunk contest question\n\nDraymond Green weighs in on Giannis Antetokounmpo, Warriors rumors",

    "description": "With less than a week to go a lot of trade talk is out there, but the Giannis Antetokounmpo situation could hold up other deals.",
    "fullText": "We are less than a week away from the NBA trade deadline and rumors are flying around fast and furious. Here are some of the latest rumors not involving Giannis Antetokounmpo (to check out the latest on his trade saga, click here).\n\nIt's no secret the Lakers are looking for help on the wing and some depth at the five.\n\nEnter De'Andre Hunter, the Cleveland wing. The Lakers and Cavaliers reportedly have discussed a trade that would send Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht out of Los Angeles and involves a third team, Brooklyn. Here is what Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com reported on the Wine & Gold Podcast.\n\n\"My sources tell me that the Cavs and the Lakers have discussed a general framework surrounding De'Andre Hunter of Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht and then bringing in a third team.\"\n\nThat third team is Brooklyn, and the Lakers would like to get center Day'Ron Sharpe as part of the trade, reports Brett Siegel of Clutch Points.\n\nThe challenge in constructing any trade with these teams is that the Cavaliers are over the second apron, and neither can aggregate multiple players in a trade nor can they take back more money than they send out. Added to that, the Lakers are hard-capped at the first apron and are currently less than $1 million from that number. The Lakers also have one pick to trade, a very valuable 2031 first-rounder, although there have been reports that the Lakers have looked to trade that pick for three lesser-valuable first-rounders, one of which would likely be included in this.\n\nThe prize for the Lakers would be adding Hunter, a player the Cavaliers hoped would fill their need on the wing, but did not. Hunter is averaging 13.9 points a game, often off the bench in Cleveland, shooting 30.9% from beyond the arc this season he is not a lock-down defender. Giving up Hachimura for Hunter is not a great deal, but if Sharpe is coming with him, the Lakers would have to consider it.\n\nThe hottest name in trade talks is another potential Lakers target, Kings wing Keon Ellis.\n\nSacramento is \"sifting through various scenarios for Keon Ellis, sources say, several of which would include trading out veteran forward DeMar DeRozan and/or combo guard Malik Monk along with him,\" reports NBA Insider Jake Fischer of The Stein Line.\n\nMarc Stein at the Stein Line previously reported 14 teams — almost half the league — had called Sacramento to check on an Ellis trade, including the Lakers, Clippers, Cavaliers, Celtics, Knicks and Warriors.\n\nThere's a reason all those teams are interested. Ellis is a plus defender on the wing at 6'4\" who is shooting 36.2% from 3-point range this season (and is a career 41.4% shooter from deep), all on an expiring minimum contract. He is eligible for a contract extension after Feb. 9, and if a team that trades for him can't reach that extension then he becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer.\n\nIf the Kings pair Monk with Ellis in a trade, they make a combined $21 million; with DeRozan, that climbs to $27 million. Either option gives the Kings some flexibility to bring back someone they think can be part of their future.\n\n• Agent Rich Paul denied the reports that he pushed Dallas to trade Anthony Davis.\n\nRich Paul says it’s NOT TRUE that he has demanded the Mavericks to trade Anthony Davis \n\n“I know what was said. That thing was aggregated. This is the power of the internet. If you’re wondering why Rich Paul has a podcast, this is part of the reason why… The reality of it is,… pic.twitter.com/ctWNnlpR0x\n\n— NBA Courtside (@NBA__Courtside) January 25, 2026\n\n• Cleveland has been active in trade talks as it looks to turn around a disappointing season so far, although nobody is exactly sure what their plan is, reports Brian Windhorst and Tim Bontemps of ESPN.\n\n• Oklahoma City may be exploring the trade market for center Isaiah Hartenstein, reports Brian Windhorst of ESPN on the Hoop Collective Podcast. \"He's got a team option next year for $29 million. I've actually heard the Oklahoma City Thunder's name in some trade chatter.\" Remember that next season, both Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams' max contracts kick in, and the finances are going to get a lot tighter in OKC. They probably won't make that trade, but it's worth watching.\n\n• Expect Orlando to make a trade, but it will be all about dumping salary, according to ESPN’s Windhorst and Bontemps. The Magic are $5.6 million into the tax, and, given how this team is playing, would like to get out of it. Trading Tyus Jones and his $7 million salary is a straightforward way to do that.",

    "fullText": "Charles Barkley isn’t holding back his disappointment over Michael Jordan’s NBC appearances this season. Fans had eagerly awaited the NBA legend’s insights on modern basketball as the network returned to airing games in 2025-26, but what aired left many underwhelmed.\n\nBarkley, speaking candidly, called the arrangement “disingenuous” and criticized NBC, claiming the rollout didn’t live up to the hype surrounding the six-time NBA Finals champion.\n\nCharles Barkley, whose relationship with Michael Jordan has cooled over the years, expressed frustration on SiriusXM NBA Radio. “I was excited to have Michael because Michael Jordan is the reason we all make this money from the NBA,” he said. He added, “But now you see this thing coming out with NBC… one interview five months ago, and you’re all gonna sprinkle it throughout the season? Come on, man. That’s disingenuous by NBC. That’s crazy.”\n\nBarkley didn’t mince words about how the network handled the coverage. “It’s a bad look for NBC, it’s just a bad look, plain and simple. They couldn’t fly to Michael like once a month and do a new interview? That makes NBC look really bad,” he added, emphasizing his disappointment in the setup. ( via Awful Announcing)\n\nMichael Jordan’s appearance was restricted to a single pre-recorded segment, MJ: Insights to Excellence, which ran across a few shows. While it offered some interesting takes, a lot of fans were hoping for deeper commentary on the state of today’s game. Host Mike Tirico defended the setup, saying Jordan “really wanted to talk about where he sees the game right now,” adding that viewers still got to hear his perspective, even if it wasn’t as in-depth as expected.\n\nTirico noted that Jordan’s love for basketball really shone through. He loves the game, and in some ways, he’s not a fan of where it’s headed, and he wanted to share that, Tirico said. Tirico also acknowledged that while the segment might not have satisfied every fan craving MJ insight, it was still special to hear from the legend himself. Tirico also hinted that future appearances could give fans even more of the coverage they’re hoping for.\n\nThe post NBA Veteran Targets Michael Jordan & NBC Deal: ‘It’s Bad’ appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Thursday’s NBA slate is packed with storylines and pressure games. A few teams are trying to snap losing streaks, while others want to protect their home courts. Big names like Tyrese Maxey, Cade Cunningham, Kevin Durant, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are set to take center stage. The games on January 29 are not just about wins and losses. They also show where each team truly stands as the season moves forward. Here is a closer look at every game. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nSacramento comes in on a six-game losing streak and has struggled badly on the road with a 3-20 record. Philadelphia has been average at home, but their rebounding edge stands out. The 76ers pull down 12.3 offensive rebounds per game, led by Andre Drummond at 3.5. Tyrese Maxey is carrying the offense with 29.2 points per game and strong playmaking. Joel Embiid has also been steady over the last 10 games with over 20 points per night. Sacramento gives up 120.8 points per game, which lines up poorly against a team that scores more than 116 per outing. DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook can score, but the Kings allow too many open looks. Philadelphia already controls the glass and should create second chances. That gap makes the home team the safer pick.\n\nPredicted winner: Sacramento Kings\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Capital One Arena, Washington\n\nMilwaukee has dropped three straight games and is only 3-7 in its last ten. Washington is not much better, but they recently beat Milwaukee 114-113 on January 1. Alex Sarr leads the Wizards with 17.7 points and 7.5 rebounds, giving them size inside. The Bucks allow 14.1 made threes per game, while Washington averages nearly 13 from deep. That matchup favors the home team. Ryan Rollins and AJ Green have been productive for Milwaukee, but the team still gives up over 115 points per game in recent outings. Wizards games tend to stay close, and they are 2-2 in games decided by three points or fewer. Another tight finish is likely, and Washington has already shown it can win this game.\n\nPredicted winner: Washington Wizards\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nBrooklyn is on a six-game slide and is 6-16 on the road. Turnovers are a big issue, with 14.6 per game. Denver plays better at home and moves the ball well, ranking near the top in assists. Jamal Murray averages 25.9 points and 7.4 assists, while the Nuggets hit nearly 14 threes per game. Brooklyn did win the first meeting this season, but that came at home. Denver has gone 6-4 over the last ten and keeps opponents around 108 points. The Nets allow over 117 points per game in that same span. Porter and Claxton provide effort, yet the defense breaks down too often. Denver’s balanced attack and home court give them the edge.\n\nPredicted winner: Brooklyn Nets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Footprint Center, Phoenix\n\nDetroit owns the best record in the East at 34-11 and has won four straight road games. The Pistons also rank near the top in defense, allowing only 110 points per game. Phoenix is strong at home but is missing key players like Devin Booker and Jalen Green. Cade Cunningham leads Detroit with 25.3 points and nearly 10 assists per game. Phoenix relies heavily on Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen for scoring. The Suns score 114 per game, but Detroit scores more and defends better. Detroit also won the first meeting 108-105. With Phoenix short-handed, the Pistons have the advantage in depth and form.\n\nPredicted winner: Detroit Pistons\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: State Farm Arena, Atlanta\n\nHouston is 28-16 and plays strong defense, ranking fourth in points allowed at 110.5. Atlanta scores well but struggles to stop teams, giving up nearly 119 per game. Kevin Durant just dropped 33 points in Houston’s last win and continues to be the focal point. The Rockets also rebound well, pulling in 49 per game. Atlanta moves the ball better than anyone, averaging over 31 assists per game, led by CJ McCollum’s recent form. Even so, the Hawks give up too many open shots and free throws. Houston’s mix of scoring and defense should control the pace. That balance makes them the better pick.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nChicago is coming off a loss to the Lakers but remains competitive at home. Miami beat Phoenix in its last game and has momentum. The Heat crushed Chicago earlier this season 143-107, though the Bulls dominated the matchup last year. Coby White and Ayo Dosunmu lead Chicago’s scoring. Bam Adebayo anchors Miami inside. Both teams sit around .500, which suggests a close game. Chicago usually plays tougher defense at home and will want payback for the earlier blowout. Miami has been steady, but the Bulls have won more often in this building. A narrow home win looks likely.\n\nPredicted winner: Chicago Bulls\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center, Dallas\n\nCharlotte just beat Philadelphia 130-93 with strong shooting and ball movement. Brandon Miller scored 30 points on 81.8% shooting. The Hornets average 116.3 points and hit 37% from three. Dallas lost to the Lakers and allowed 57 rebounds, which shows weakness on the glass. Max Christie has been productive, but Dallas still gives up 116.5 points per game. Charlotte’s passing and rebounding edge should matter. The Hornets also force turnovers and play faster. Dallas has struggled to defend consistently, which puts them at risk against a hot Charlotte offense.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Target Center, Minnesota\n\nOklahoma City leads the league in scoring at 120.8 points per game and allows just 107.9. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander continues to shine, coming off a 24-point game on 72.7% shooting. Minnesota is solid offensively at 119 per game but allows 114.3. Julius Randle had 18 points in his last outing, though the Timberwolves rely on forcing turnovers to stay competitive. The Thunder rank first in points allowed and create pressure on defense. That combination usually travels well. Minnesota is strong at home, but Oklahoma City’s efficiency and defense give them the edge.\n\nPredicted winner: Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nJanuary 29 brings a mix of uneven matchups and tight contests. Some teams hold clear edges because of defense, home court, or recent form. Others are expected to grind out close wins based on past results and key player performances. These games will shape momentum for the next stretch of the season. This schedule offers plenty of reasons to stay tuned from the first tip-off to the final buzzer.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 29: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

I don't know if it's my last game here or not.\n\n\"Lot of memories here. Lot of history. Just super grateful and thankful for the time. Looking up in the rafters and seeing our championship banner, of course there was a lot of reflecting.\"\n\nJames said he doesn't see this season as his NBA farewell tour.\n\n\"I've never even thought to the point of a farewell tour or whatever the case may be because I haven't had that conversation with myself and my family on when is it over,\" he said.\n\nDonovan Mitchell, whose 25 points led Cleveland, understood that even with the Cavaliers (29-20) win streak at five games, this night belonged to James and his legacy of making Cleveland a champion after 52 years of failure in major US sports leagues.\n\n\"He has laid the foundation,\" Mitchell said. \"He has done a lot for the city being from here. We want to replicate that.\n\n\"He deserves the energy he has got here. First time they have done it in 50-some years. We're trying to do it differently. At the end of the day, we're trying to find ways to go out there and bring the city another championship.\"\n\nLuka Doncic had a game-high 29 points for the Lakers (28-18), who also had eight points from Bronny James, LeBron's son.\n\n\"It was pretty cool just sitting over there and watching him,\" James said. \"My mom was here watching her son and her grandson. I don't even know how to wrap that all in my brain. It's so weird and so cool and so surreal.\"\n\nJames, who fell to 9-4 as a visiting player in Cleveland, had averaged 28 points a game in 24 prior contests against the Cavs, who outscored the Lakers 42-22 in the third quarter for a 99-77 lead, hitting 7-of-11 shots from three-point range and 17-of-25 overall in the period.\n\n\"We got outplayed. I got outcoached,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \"We just didn't look like we had all our juice.\"\n\nThe Cavs were without reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley due to a left calf strain.\n\nIn other games, Victor Wembanyama had game highs of 28 points, 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to spark San Antonio's 111-99 triumph at Houston.\n\nPaolo Banchero delivered 31 points for Orlando in a 133-124 victory at Miami while New York's Mikal Bridges scored 30 in a 119-92 victory at Toronto and Julius Randle scored 31 in Minnesota's 118-105 victory at Dallas.\n\nStephen Curry scored 27 points to lead Golden State's 140-124 victory at Utah.",

He immediately grabbed at his lower left leg and was unable to stand up. The Lakers called a timeout and trainers helped Doncic to his feet. He hobbled toward the Lakers locker room, putting almost no weight on his left leg.\n\nHe returned to the court with 1:32 left in the first quarter. He has four points on one-of-six shooting from the field, missing all three of his shots from deep early in the second quarter.\n\nCleveland’s home court is raised above the arena floor to accommodate for an ice hockey rink underneath. It's the only arena in the NBA with the unique set up. Miami Heat guard Dru Smith suffered a severe anterior cruciate ligament sprain from slipping off the court in 2023.\n\nDoncic, the NBA’s leading scorer, is averaging 33.8 points for the Lakers, who are in the midst of an eight-game road trip.

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Mookie Betts will be heading to the basketball court in February to coach at the Ruffles Celebrity Game during NBA All-Star weekend.\n\nThe NBA announced Betts as a coach for the game that will take place on Feb. 13 at the Kia Forum in Inglewood. ESPN’s Buster Olney was the first to report the news on Tuesday via X.\n\nDodgers superstar Mookie Betts will be coaching in the Ruffles Celeb Game in LA!\n\nFriday, 2/13 at 7:00pm/et on ESPN\n\nGet your tickets to the Ruffles Celeb Game: https://t.co/aVa6hMPMEjhttps://t.co/vP31bcmFyo\n\n— #NBAAllStar (@NBAAllStar) January 27, 2026\n\nIn addition to Betts, ESPN NBA insider Shams Charania, rapper GloRilla and producer Mustard will participate in the Celebrity Game. The rosters for each team have yet to be finalized, so it has yet to be determined which celebrities Betts will coach.\n\nBetts is not only a four-time World Series champion, an eight-time All-Star and the 2018 American League Most Valuable Player. But he is also a talented multi-sport athlete with hobbies such as golf, bowling and basketball.\n\nHe was seen playing basketball with NBA veteran Chris Paul in December shortly after the Los Angeles Clippers cut the future Hall of Famer. Betts also hosts an annual “Mookie Betts + Friends Bowling Tournament” to help raise money for his 50/50 Foundation and recently played a round of golf with former United States president Barack Obama at Lakeside Golf Club in December.\n\nAfter coaching the Celebrity Game, Betts will report to spring training with the Dodgers before the team’s first spraining training game against the Los Angeles Angels on Feb. 21.\n\nBetts is coming off a strong season at shortstop, winning his first Gold Glove at the position in 2025. He and the Dodgers are looking to win a third straight World Series championship in 2026, and Betts will be a crucial part of achieving that feat.\n\nBetts has the most World Series championships of any active player in MLB.\n\nWinning another title would put Betts into an exclusive group of MLB players who have won five World Series throughout their careers. Former New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra holds the all-time record with 10 World Series championships.\n\nThe post Dodgers Fan Favorite Set to Coach in NBA All-Star Celebrity Game appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX – When a superstar hints he may be ready for a new home, the NBA’s ecosystem shifts. Giannis Antetokounmpo has been the gravitational center of Milwaukee for a decade. Still, if the Bucks begin listening, every contender has to ask the uncomfortable question of what it takes to acquire his talents, and would it be worth it? Would the Phoenix Suns even entertain that question?\n\nFeb 6, 2024; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Detailed view of the jersey of Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (34) against the Phoenix Suns at Footprint Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFor Phoenix, the answer starts with creativity. This wouldn’t be a clean, one-for-one blockbuster. It would likely be a multi-player constructed trade offer built around scoring upside and future flexibility. Jalen Green would be the most obvious trade piece. An explosive, high-variance scorer whose career has flashed elite shot creation fits the archetype Milwaukee would need to reset around youth and offense, even if injuries have limited his recent availability. Add in veteran connective tissue like Royce O’Neale and the upside swing of Ryan Dunn, and suddenly the framework resembles something tangible, although the chances of the Phoenix Suns pulling the trigger on a trade that big right now seem slim.\n\nApr 1, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (34) drives for the basket against Phoenix Suns forward Oso Ighodaro (4) and guard Ryan Dunn (0) in the second quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Benny Sieu-Imagn Images\n\nThe data backs the temptation. Giannis remains a top-tier efficiency engine, combining rim pressure, playmaking gravity, and defensive impact that few players in history can match. Phoenix, meanwhile, has leaned heavily on stars whose availability has fluctuated. For Suns fans, the emotional math is harder. Not only does trading away talented youth hurt, but giving up on potential after a handful of games feels premature. Then there is the history behind the player, as Giannis Antetokounmpo helped deliver Milwaukee a title against Phoenix in the 2021 NBA Finals. Seeing him in a Suns jersey would feel like a glitch in the timeline.\n\nMar 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (34) defends against Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker (1) at Footprint Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nBut championships are built on uncomfortable bets. It would be an absolute long shot for Phoenix, though. The Suns have the pieces, the urgency, and the incentive to make the call at least. Whether they’re willing to pay the real price, or if that is even on the table, is the story worth monitoring.\n\nMassive on-court brawl breaks out in Phoenix Suns’ win vs Nets",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo is ready to move on from the Milwaukee Bucks -- and contenders around the NBA reportedly are making \"aggressive\" pitches to land the two-time MVP ahead of next Thursday's trade deadline.\n\nOne team almost guaranteed to kick the tires on Antetokounmpo is the Golden State Warriors. Though the hard-capped Warriors hardly have an asset warchest to offer the Bucks, Golden State can dangle a contract to match salaries that another team might not dangle -- or cannot dangle.\n\nMORE: Warriors make Giannis Antetokounmpo trade decision as Bucks star prepares to move on\n\nThe Warriors' trade deadline outlook -- and their season at large -- changed irrevocably when Jimmy Butler went down with a season-ending knee injury last Monday. Butler is signed through next season at a $56.8 million salary, and Sports Illustrated's Chris Mannix reports that the Warriors would offer Butler's contract -- plus Jonathan Kuminga -- in a deal to land Antetokounmpo.\n\nThe Warriors are willing to offer a Jonathan Kuminga/Jimmy Butler–headlined package with draft picks for Giannis Antetokounmpo, per @SIChrisMannix\n\n(Via @SInow ) pic.twitter.com/NUisKudSll\n\n— NBACentral (@TheDunkCentral) January 28, 2026\n\nKuminga has been linked with the Miami Heat, the Sacramento Kings and the Los Angeles Lakers. His two-year, $48.5 million contract has a team option for next season, which could make him an attractive option for a team like the Bucks -- who are poised to retool once a Giannis trade is completed.\n\nEven with the Bucks reject this offer, the Warriors seem intent on getting another star before the deadline -- and if they don't, they may try again on Antetokounmpo in the summer.\n\nDid the Warriors trade for Anthony Davis? Viral fake post involving Mavericks star dupes NBA fans\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo's $275 million contract update gives Bucks star every reason to want a trade now\n\nThere's only 1 combination of Lakers players to trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo without LeBron\n\nKnicks get the Giannis Antetokounmpo trade news they've been waiting for, but there are two caveats",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDillon Brooks landed in some hot water with NBA officials on Tuesday night.\n\nAs the Phoenix Suns and the Brooklyn Nets battled it out, Brooks landed a technical foul after getting tangled up with his opponent. For Brooks, it was his 15th tech of the season, placing him one away from a suspension this year.\n\nFortunately, Brooks will not be in danger of suspension the next time he steps on the court. On Wednesday, the NBA announced that the technical foul had been rescinded upon league office review. That’s great news for the Suns, who have been fortunate to see Brooks take a major step for their team this season.\n\nBrooks wrapped up Tuesday night’s action with 26 points off 9-15 shooting from the field, 2-5 from three, and 6-6 from the charity stripe. He added three rebounds, three assists, one steal, and one block in 34 minutes of action. The Suns defeated the Nets 106-102.\n\nSince getting traded to the Suns from the Houston Rockets, Brooks has taken his game to another level.\n\nIn 41 matchups, the veteran forward has shot 44 percent from the field. He is attempting 7.0 threes per game, knocking down 34 percent of his shots from beyond the arc. The veteran forward is producing 20.5 points per game, which marks a new career-high for him. He is also producing 2.9 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game.\n\nAfter a major offseason shakeup, the NBA world didn’t know what to make of the Suns this year. So far, they have been highly impressive. After a win over the Nets, the Suns are 29-19 on the year. They place sixth in the Western Conference, trailing the Los Angeles Lakers by one game.\n\nBooker and the Suns will get Wednesday night off. They’ll return to the court on Thursday for a home game against the Eastern Conference’s top squad, the Detroit Pistons.\n\nStephen Curry, Warriors gifted one-in-a-lifetime Giannis Antetokounmpo trade opportunity\n\nLos Angeles Clippers trending in the right direction, but can they sustain it?\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo's $275 million contract update gives him every reason to want a trade now",

    "description": "The 2026 NBA trade deadline is Feb. 5. Phoenix Suns head coach Jordan Ott explains where his head is at before the deadline.",
    "fullText": "Jordan Ott’s primary focus as a first-year head coach has been on present, not the past or future.\n\nSo the way he first answered a question about the Feb. 5 trade deadline wasn’t surprising.\n\n“I’m trying to win a game tonight,” a smiling Ott said during pregame availability Jan. 27, as the Phoenix Suns (27-19) face the Brooklyn Nets (12-32) at Mortgage Matchup Center.\n\nThe Suns are seventh in the Western Conference and are playing above preseason predictions, but they’ve made trade deadline moves before under team owner Mat Ishbia starting with the blockbuster Kevin Durant deal in 2023.\n\nHowever, Ott said the Suns “love” the team currently constructed as they’re eyeing the return of Jalen Green moving forward.\n\nSuns coach Jordan Ott on Feb. 5 trade deadline: \"We have people in place in leadership to take care of a lot of that stuff. We know it's right around the corner, but we love our group. We continue to say that. Our group growing internally. Our big piece we're going to get back is… pic.twitter.com/X7MkHgKaMG\n\n— Duane Rankin (@DuaneRankin) January 28, 2026\n\n“We have people in place in leadership to take care of a lot of that stuff,” Ott said. \"We know it's right around the corner, but we love our group. We love our group. We continue to say that. Our group is growing internally. Our big piece we're going to get back is Jalen Green and that's what we're excited about.”\n\nPhoenix can’t trade any first-round picks through 2032. The Suns can move their 2033 first-round pick the night of the 2026 draft.\n\nGreen missed a second straight game after tweaking his right hamstring in the first quarter of Friday’s loss to the Atlanta Hawks to end six-game road trip.\n\nThat was Green’s second game back after missing 33 consecutive games with what the Suns called a right hamstring strain. He’s only played four games in his first season with the Suns, who acquired him from the Houston Rockets in the Kevin Durant trade.\n\nThe Suns had an MRI on Green after the Atlanta game that revealed no new damage. Green has had two workouts since with the latest one after Tuesday’s morning shootaround.\n\n“Everything seems to be good,” Ott said. “We'll continue to reassess. Get him back on the court when he's ready to go.\"\n\nOtt has said Green is day-to-day, adding Tuesday that Green doesn’t need to do 5-on-5 to return to the court. Green had multiple 5-on-5 runs with teammates, coaches and staff before returning Jan. 20 against Philadelphia during the six-game road trip after missing 33 consecutive games.\n\n“He had enough before he came back the last time,” Ott said. “It's more just, feel good. We're right there. It's nothing new. That was helpful. Just ease the mind. He's been out two months so some of that is expected. It's a new era for him, too. He's never had something like this. When he feels right, he'll be back out there. Dying to get back out there. We're dying to have him out there, but we want to have him right.\"\n\nGreen is averaging a career-low 11.8 points in his four games with the Suns.\n\nPhoenix is also down Devin Booker (right ankle sprain), Collin Gillespie (right hand sprain) and two-way player Isaiah Livers (illness).\n\nOtt said Gillespie hurt his hand when falling to the floor in Sunday’s loss to the Miami Heat and that it’s a “short-term” injury. Booker sprained his right ankle in the third quarter of the Atlanta loss. The Suns announced Sunday, Jan. 25, that Booker would be re-evaluated in a week.\n\nHave opinions about the current state of the Suns?

    "fullText": "Tuesday night in the NBA delivered drama, big performances, and tight finishes. Several teams snapped losing streaks, while others struggled to close games. Young stars made noise and veterans stepped up when needed. From last-second free throws to fourth-quarter takeovers, the night had a bit of everything. Here is a breakdown of the winners and losers from all the games.\n\nWashington finally snapped its nine-game losing streak with a tough home win. Alex Sarr led the way with 29 points, 12 rebounds, and six blocks, staying aggressive all night. Kyshawn George and Bub Carrington made big plays late, while Khris Middleton calmly iced the game at the line. Even after getting crushed on the boards, the Wizards found timely buckets and ended a home losing run against Portland that stretched back to 2017.\n\nPortland dominated the glass but couldn’t finish the job. Shaedon Sharpe scored 31 points, and Donovan Clingan added 14 points and 20 rebounds. Deni Avdija had a solid return with 17 points and 12 boards. Missed free throws and another late collapse cost them a winnable game.\n\nNew York owned the fourth quarter by outscoring Sacramento 31-15. Jalen Brunson led the charge with 28 points and took control late. Karl-Anthony Towns added 17 points and 11 rebounds. Mikal Bridges chipped in with 18 points and OG Anunoby had 15. The Knicks forced the pace and turned defense into offense. Mike Brown also earned his first win against Sacramento since leaving the team. Even with 21 turnovers, New York stayed composed when it mattered most.\n\nSacramento lost its sixth straight game and struggled badly from deep. The team shot just 5 of 30 from three-point range. DeMar DeRozan scored 34 points but had little help. Russell Westbrook added 14 points but could not spark a rally. Their offense went cold in the fourth quarter and they could not keep up with New York’s run. Poor shooting and weak defense in the final period sealed their fate.\n\nPhiladelphia bounced back after a blowout loss the night before. Paul George scored 32 points and hit nine three-pointers. Joel Embiid had 29 points and scored 18 in the first quarter alone. Tyrese Maxey added 22 points and kept the offense moving. The Sixers played with fresh energy after both stars returned from rest. Their shooting and ball movement overwhelmed Milwaukee. The win also showed how different this team looks with its main players healthy.\n\nMilwaukee played without Giannis Antetokounmpo and felt his absence. Myles Turner scored 31 points and Ryan Rollins added 24, but defense was the issue. The Bucks allowed too many open looks from three. Bobby Portis and Kyle Kuzma each had 17 points but could not stop the Sixers’ runs. Injuries continued to hurt their rhythm and depth.\n\nOklahoma City avoided a third straight loss despite missing several key players. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 29 points and stayed perfect at the line. Chet Holmgren delivered 20 points, 14 rebounds, and five blocks. Isaiah Joe added 17 points off the bench. The Thunder stayed steady during a late Pelicans push. Strong defense and patience helped them close the game.\n\nNew Orleans could not finish its comeback after cutting the lead to five. Zion Williamson had 21 points and 11 rebounds on efficient shooting. Saddiq Bey added 16 points and 13 rebounds. Tempers flared late and the flow of the game slipped away from them. Missed chances in the final minutes cost them a third-quarter rally.\n\nDetroit continued its strong run and held off a late Denver charge. Tobias Harris scored 22 points and hit two clutch free throws. Cade Cunningham finished with 22 points and 11 assists. The Pistons built an early lead and survived missed shots down the stretch. Their balance and poise showed again in a tight finish.\n\nDenver struggled with travel issues and missing players. Jamal Murray had 24 points and 10 assists but missed key free throws late. Jonas Valanciunas posted 16 points and 16 rebounds in his return. Fatigue and injuries hurt their execution. The rally fell short after several missed chances.\n\nPhoenix won despite missing key scorers. Mark Williams had 27 points and Dillon Brooks added 26. Grayson Allen chipped in with 18 points. The Suns survived a late Nets run and closed the game with defense and free throws. Even after a scuffle broke out, they stayed focused and finished strong.\n\nBrooklyn lost its sixth straight game. Michael Porter Jr. scored a season-high 36 points but got little support. Egor Demin added 15 points. The Nets could not hold a late lead and struggled with second scoring options. Emotions ran high and technical fouls did not help their cause.\n\nThe Clippers erased an early deficit with a huge second and third quarter. Kawhi Leonard led the comeback and stayed steady late. Kris Dunn sparked a big third-quarter surge with defense and playmaking. Los Angeles outscored Utah 36-20 in the third and never looked back. The win moved them closer to a .500 record.\n\nUtah started fast but faded after halftime. Lauri Markkanen led early but struggled later. The Jazz could not handle the Clippers’ pressure defense. Scoring dried up in the second half and the lead slipped away quickly. Another loss showed their trouble finishing games.\n\nJanuary 27 brought strong wins for teams like Washington, New York, and Philadelphia. Young stars like Alex Sarr and Chet Holmgren made a clear impact. Veteran leaders such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George also delivered when needed. On the losing side, missed free throws and cold shooting proved costly for several teams. The night showed how small moments can decide close NBA games.\n\nThe post NBA results: January 27, 2026 – winners and losers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "A sports nutritionist for NBA champs explains why athletes stop drinking water after 4 p.m. to optimize hydration and perform their best.",
    "fullText": "NBA champions don't have time for morning brain fog or an afternoon slump.\n\nTheir secret to staying sharp all day long: perfectly-timed water breaks, according to a top sports nutritionist.\n\nMatt Jones, who worked with the Boston Celtics during their 2024 NBA Championship-winning season and advises the supplement brand Cadence, said the pros have mastered the art of optimal hydration.\n\n\"Fueling intentionally is probably one of the biggest things we can take from the world of professional sport,\" he told Business Insider. \"Professional athletes are very good at repeating basic behaviors like hydrating, and it's those routines that allow them to perform to the best of their ability.\"\n\nIf you want to level up your hydration game, start paying attention to how much you drink and when, Jones recommends.\n\nAfter years of experience coaching elite athletes and military professionals, he has five key tips for getting enough water and electrolytes for better performance throughout the day.\n\nStaying hydrated makes a big difference to your brain and body in the office or on the basketball court, Jones said.\n\n\"It can impact your mood, your decision-making; it can impact the way you just go about your normal life,\" he said.\n\nResearch suggests that mild or moderate dehydration can impair reaction time and memory. Physically, being dehydrated can reduce strength and endurance, and make it more difficult to recover after exercise.\n\nJones uses a gold-standard test to see if his athletes need to drink more water. It can tell you if you're dehydrated based on three symptoms:\n\nEveryone's water needs are different, based on how much energy you use.\n\nJones said the gold standard recommendation is 1 milliliter to 1.5 milliliters per calorie of energy expenditure (in normal conditions). Two liters — or that eight cups of water a day you've probably heard about — makes sense for someone who burns 2,000 calories a day, but you may need more or less depending on your body size and activity level.\n\nSleeping is a superpower for athletes, and a simple tip helps them stay well-hydrated without too many overnight bathroom trips.\n\nJones said the solution for his athletes, including the Celtics, is to drink 80% of their fluids for the day before 4 p.m. so that their bodies have time to process all that liquid before bedtime.\n\nPlain water should be your first priority for hydration, but other drinks and even foods can count toward your daily total.\n\nFor instance, your morning brew can help keep you hydrated, since caffeinated drinks in moderation lead to a net gain in fluid. Just steer clear of artificially sweetened or sugary beverages, too much of which can cause health issues like chronic inflammation over time.\n\nHydrating foods such as fruits and veggies also provide electrolytes to regulate the fluids in your body.\n\nSodium, or salt, is a key electrolyte, but you probably get enough in your diet already. Instead, Jones said to focus on potassium to offset the side effects of too much sodium, such as high blood pressure.\n\nGood sources of potassium include bananas, avocados, coconut water, pomegranate, and watermelon.\n\nDehydration can sneak up on you before you realize it, especially if you're sweating a lot.\n\n\"During intense exercise, particularly in warm environments, thirst is not a good indicator of hydration status,\" Jones said. \"People are often chasing their tails a little bit.\"\n\nYou can calculate your sweat rate to estimate just how much water you need to replace during exercise, like Jones does with the pros.\n\nPrevent a dip in performance by drinking water at regular intervals.\n\n\"The first priority as soon as your big toe hits planet earth in the morning is to rehydrate,\" Jones said.",

    "description": "The NBA released the list of participants for the Castrol Rising Stars for the 2026 All-Star Weekend. A list intended to celebrate the league’s future stars turned into disrespect for Golden State Warriors fans.",
    "fullText": "The NBA released the list of participants for the Castrol Rising Stars for the 2026 All-Star Weekend. A list intended to celebrate the league’s future stars turned into disrespect for Golden State Warriors fans. With multiple teams getting more than one selection on both rookie and sophomore teams, Dub Nation found not even one of theirs on the list.\n\nTwo years ago, Brandin Podziemski was the sole selection for the Warriors. Last year, their representation increased to two players. This year, the Warriors were among the 15 teams without representation on the sophomore and rookie lists. The Dub Nation is one of the proudest fan bases, and giving them no representation invited voices calling out the league. “Not one Warrior smh,” a fan wrote, expressing discontent with the selection.\n\nLet’s not forget, they were the most dominant team of the last decade, and produced stars like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. So, being denied entry into the list would surely warrant outrage from the fanbase. They were particularly upset with their rookie, Will Richard, getting no recognition.\n\nIn the past, several notable names haven’t made the Rising Star selection. Cam Whitmore, Tari Eason and Andrew Nembhard, who are gradually making their mark in the league, all missed the selection in 2024.\n\nIsaiah Collier, one of the best bench players in the league, was one of the missing names last year. These past snubs have also attracted similar outrage from fans on social media.\n\nThe Warriors fans’ discontent extended beyond representation. They boldly called out the league, with a fan demanding respect for one of their rookies. “Respect Will Richard.” The sentiment is certainly not baseless. The No. 56 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft has vastly outperformed expectations. He made his debut with a 13-point performance.\n\nRichard has emerged as a consistent contributor from the bench. Steve Kerr has shown trust in him, and he won over fans in his first game. He plays on both ends, and his defensive mindset has earned him Rookie of the Year praise from fans on social media. “Will Richard snubbed,” a Warriors fan bluntly called out the selection.\n\nHowever, it’s not only Warriors fans who had an issue with the lack of representation. Remember Hugo Gonzalez, Joe Mazzulla’s instinctive weapon? “Hugo Gonzalez snubbed,” a Celtics fan was clearly upset with his name not being selected. Gonzalez became an instant favorite among the Celtics fans after he made the game-tying 3-pointer to send the game against the Brooklyn Nets into double overtime.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors had one selection. Collin Murray-Boyles, the rookie from Gamecocks, had slowly gotten himself into the starter’s role in the absence of Jakob Pöltl. However, a Raptors fan took issue with one player’s absence from the sophomore roster.\n\n“Where is Jamal Shead?” one fan pointed out. Shead has emerged as the primary backup point guard for the Raptors this season. He is only behind Isaiah Collier for the most bench assists this season. Raptors fans’ issue with him being snubbed was perhaps warranted.\n\nAce Bailey was one of the biggest snubs in the selection. He is the only player from the top 9 rookie selections from 2025 who didn’t make the cut. With Utah having no players on either team, some felt he should have made it.\n\nHowever, with just 21 slots available, deserving players missing out is perhaps unavoidable. However, does it seal a player’s fate? Absolutely not.\n\nThe post Dub Nation Demands Respect After Warriors Star Is Snubbed in NBA Rising Stars Announcement appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrinity Rodman has officially put pen to paper, ending months of uncertainty with a record-setting agreement that keeps her with the Washington Spirit through 2028.\n\nTrinity Rodman is now reportedly the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world.\n\nThe 23-year-old forward signed a three-year deal with the Washington Spirit, where she started her career, valued at an estimated $2 million per year, when counting in bonuses.\n\nThe deal comes… pic.twitter.com/8MMmCr1O3p\n\n— PBS News (@NewsHour) January 26, 2026\n\nThe United States forward signed a new three-year contract worth more than $2 million per year, including bonuses, according to multiple reports. The deal makes Rodman the highest-paid player in NWSL history and, per her agent Mike Senkowski, the highest-paid women’s soccer player in the world. The announcement was made at an event in Los Angeles alongside Spirit owner Michele Kang and club executives, while Rodman continues training with the USWNT.\n\nMORE: Athlete cult favorite Jack in the Box announces 75th anniversary streetwear drop\n\n“It feels amazing. I’m very happy, I’m very blessed,” Rodman said after signing. “I think it’s a monumental and game-changing moment right now.” She added that the deal aligns with her long-term vision, calling it “perfect timing with the World Cup happening in the U.S.”\n\nThe agreement closes a chaotic chapter that began when Rodman’s previous contract expired on Dec. 31. Despite being the league’s most recognizable star, she entered the offseason without a deal, fueling speculation that she could leave the National Women's Soccer League entirely. Sources indicated that top clubs abroad — particularly in England — had made lucrative offers that Washington could not match under the league’s salary cap, which stood at $3.5 million per team in 2025.\n\nIn late November, Rodman and the Spirit reportedly reached a creative four-year agreement that would have averaged more than $1 million per season. That proposal was later rejected by the league, with commissioner Jessica Berman ruling that it violated league rules. The NWSL also accused Rodman of attempting to circumvent the cap, prompting the NWSL Players Association to file a grievance on her behalf, calling the intervention a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nAs the standoff intensified, the league’s board of governors approved a new High Impact Player (HIP) rule in December, allowing teams to exceed the salary cap by up to $1 million for certain star players. Spirit president of soccer operations Haley Carter confirmed that Rodman’s new contract benefited from the implementation of that rule.\n\n“Not only me personally but all of us at the Spirit are profoundly grateful that she has chosen to stay with us,” Kang said, referencing the “very compelling alternatives” Rodman had elsewhere.\n\nMORE: Ex-NFL QB Kellen Mond roasts former head coach: 'Leadership is an atmosphere you create'\n\nRodman, drafted second overall by Washington in 2021, helped deliver the club’s first NWSL championship as a rookie and has remained its centerpiece ever since.",

This season, he has started in 36 games, averaging career-best statistics of 16.9 points, 7.1 assists, 5.0 rebounds, and 1.30 steals in 31.0 minutes per game. This season, he became the fastest player in Spurs history to reach 1,500 points and 500 assists, accomplishing it in just 105 games.\n\nTwo-way guard 24-year-old David Jones Garcia is also representing them in Los Angeles. In nine regular-season games with the Austin Spurs, he leads the league in scoring with an impressive average of 26.8 points per game.

    "fullText": "While Minnesota is supercharged with emotions, Stephen Curry demonstrated physical grit of his own. Before he lent heartfelt support to the grieving community that’s rattled by the death of Alex Pretti on Saturday (the day the game was originally scheduled for), Curry led the Warriors to a 111-85 win. All while powering through injuries, getting hurt again, and adding another historic knotch to his resume.\n\nCurry revealed he was following the goings-on in Minnesota while he spent Saturday resting his knee after the game was cancelled. He was listed as questionable before Sunday’s rescheduled game. But he played 28 minutes and was instrumental in the Dubs’ turnaround. Another player stepped on his toe, but that didn’t seem to slow him down.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the Dubs and Wolves have a back-to-back rematch tomorrow. When asked if he would be available tomorrow, Curry said, “If everything goes well, yeah. With the recovery and all that, the minutes tonight weren’t crazy, so hopefully I respond well.”\n\nWhen the Golden State Warriors landed in Minnesota yesterday, some of the players got their workouts in before the game was canceled. The point guard hurt his knee during that. “Kind of something flared up yesterday when we came over to get a workout in. It was super weird,” he revealed.\n\nBut his personal injury update is a lot more concerning when he reveals some persistent issues. “I’ve had stuff going on with quads and whatnot, but it was something that I hadn’t felt before. So, I definitely took advantage of the day off to get right, but hopefully that continues.”\n\nAfter Jimmy Butler’s season-ending ACL tear, followed by Jonathan Kuminga’s indefinite break for bone bruising, the last thing Dub Nation can deal with is an injured Steph. Tomorrow De’Anthony Melton and Al Horford sit out for injury management and fans wouldn’t mind if Steph joined them. Moving up the all-time scoring ladder can wait a little longer.\n\nDespite battling injuries, Stephen Curry had an impressive 26 points, 2 rebounds, 7 assists, and 4 steals. That alone carried him to the 19th spot on the NBA’s All-time Scoring list. He passed John Havlicek and tied Paul Pierce for cracking the top 20 with 26,397 points in his career.\n\nHe’s only 99 points away from catching up to Tim Duncan next. So far this season, Curry has averaged 27.3 points, 5.0 assists, and 3.7 rebounds while shooting 46.8% from the field and 39.8% from the arc.\n\nAnalysts predict he’d crack top 10 soon enough. They, in fact, think he would’ve done it a long time ago had it not been for his injury history that also kept him underpaid for a period of time.\n\nTonight, Curry limped during the empty moments and yet he carried the offense. If he aggravates what is now a sore knee and ends up missing more than one game, the Warriors’ offense will be diminished.\n\nFor now even Steve Kerr is hopeful that Curry will be cleared to play. Steph is still listed as questionable for Monday and they’ve left his status as a game-time decision.\n\nThe post Stephen Curry Shares Worrying Injury Update After Historic NBA Achievement Against Timberwolves appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "The NBA postponed the Golden State Warriors’ scheduled game against the Minnesota Timberwolves as concerns over public safety in Minneapolis grew following a nearby fatal shooting earlier in the day.\n\nThe league said the decision was made to put community safety first amid unrest in the city.\n\nThe official NBA statement confirmed the postponement. “The National Basketball Association game scheduled for today between the Golden State Warriors and Minnesota Timberwolves at Target Center has been postponed. The decision was made to prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community.\n\n“The game has been rescheduled for tomorrow (Jan. 25) at 5:30 PM ET at Target Center.”\n\nThe league’s announcement came as local authorities and community members were responding to significant unrest following the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old man by federal officers in downtown Minneapolis.\n\nProtests and heightened tensions in the area around the Target Center were factors in the NBA’s choice to delay the matchup until the next day.\n\nAuthorities have publicly acknowledged the incident and the resulting community response, with protests and calls for accountability prompting safety concerns across downtown Minneapolis.\n\nGiven the proximity of the unrest and the potential risk to fans, players and staff, the NBA opted to delay the Warriors-Timberwolves game until conditions were expected to be more secure.\n\nPostponements due to safety concerns are rare in the NBA, but the league’s priority in such situations is to ensure that events can proceed without risk to attendees or the surrounding community.\n\nTop 10 NBA teams that cannot control their players’ bad behavior\n\nAnthony Edwards explains why Miami Heat guard makes him go to bed early\n\nAnthony Edwards takes aim at Gilbert Arenas after statement display against OKC",

    "fullText": "How good is Charles Bediako? Get to know controversial Alabama player returning to Tide after playing in NBA G League originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe world of college basketball is changing. Through loopholes, players who have gone on to play professional basketball — though not in the NBA — have found ways to return to college and tap into unused eligibility.\n\nOne such player is Alabama’s Charles Bediako. If you recognize the name, it may be because the 7-foot center spent two seasons with the Crimson Tide from 2021 to 2023. After the conclusion of the 2022–23 season, he declared for the NBA Draft.\n\nBediako wasn't selected but has played in three seasons of the G League, with three different teams. He has now cited that he made a career mistake by leaving college, especially given how the NIL landscape has shifted. Bediako pointed toward international players who never made the NBA, being able to use their unused eligibility after playing overseas, and a temporary injunction was submitted, giving him permission to suit up once again for the Crimson Tide on Saturday, January 24.\n\nHere is more on the controversial Bediako, and his return to Alabama after leaving the Crimson Tide for the G League.\n\nSN's NCAAB HQ: Scores | Schedule | Standings | Latest Polls\n\nBediako is a 7-ft. center. He is a solid player, but his college stats from his first stint at Alabama suggest that he is fine, not great. From 2021 to 2023 he averaged 6.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 19.3 minutes per game in 70 games. The Crimson Tide may use him more now if he has developed from his time in the G League, but it isn't like Alabama is getting back a former No. 1 overall pick.\n\nCharles Bediako takes the floor for warmups to a warm welcome from the student section pic.twitter.com/zhrE1DI3ZH\n\n— Katie Windham (@katiewindham_) January 24, 2026\n\nBediako played 46 games in the G League between 2023 and 2025. In that span, he averaged 21.3 minutes per game with 8.4 points and 8.0 rebounds. Bediako played better in the G League than he did at Alabama during his first stint, but it remains to be seen how his game will translate back to college.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game G League stats.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game college stats from his first stint with the Crimson Tide.\n\nNo. Bediako was not drafted. He opted to leave Alabama after the 2022-2023 season, but he went undrafted. Bediako signed with the San Antonio Spurs' G League team.\n\nMORE: Why is Bediako allowed to return to college basketball?\n\nIn the 2021 class, 247Sports had Bediako ranked as the No. 35 player in the nation. He was considered the sixth-best center as well as the seventh-best player from Florida.\n\nAmong centers, he was ranked behind Chet Holmgren, Jalen Duren, Efton Reid, Nate Bittle and Enoch Boakye. In Florida, he was ranked behind Duren, Caleb Houstan, Moussa Diabate, Reid, Bittle, Tamar Bates and Benny Williams.\n\nBediako was born in Ontario, Canada, on March 10, 2002. As college — and potentially professional — basketball became an option, he began to move around.\n\nHe started his high school career at Ridley College in Ontario before transferring to Andrews Osborne Academy in Willoughby, Ohio. Bediako later transferred again, spending the remainder of his high school career at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nBediako was born on March 10, 2002. He is 23 years old, and will turn 24 years old ahead of the 2026 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.",

    "fullText": "The 2023-24 UNC basketball team is one of the program's best teams to never win a championship. Complete with an experienced, talented roster that showcased immense chemistry, how the season ended was a disappointment.\n\nYou might recognize a few names on this roster: RJ Davis, Armando Bacot and Harrison Ingram. All three dabbled with the NBA. Davis and Ingram are currently in the G League, while Bacot is playing overseas.\n\nThe best pure shooter on that 2023-24 North Carolina roster, though, is Cormac Ryan. Transferring in from Notre Dame during the prior offseason, Ryan finished his lone season in Carolina Blue second in 3-point percentage (.354) and free throw percentage (.874).\n\nNow a member of the G-League's Wisconsin Herd, who are affiliated with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, Ryan is thriving in his second pro season.\n\nRyan is averaging 21.4 points per game on 50% field goal shooting, a 42% mark from deep and 90% mark from the free throw line.\n\nThe Herd are just 6-8 as of Saturday morning, but they have a true leader in Ryan. Question is: when will Milwaukee call Ryan up to make his NBA regular season debut?\n\nIt's no secret the 2025-26 Tar Heels could use Ryan's shooting prowess on their roster, particularly from the free throw line. UNC has its best frontcourt in years, led by Caleb Wilson and Henri Veesaar, but backcourt production is still coming into its own.\n\nThat 2023-24 North Carolina squad lost to Alabama in a heartbreaking, Sweet 16 result. Can the current Tar Heels make it a few steps deeper and bring a National Championship back to Chapel Hill?\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Cormac Ryan thriving in second season",

    "fullText": "Saturday’s NBA table is packed with games that can swing the standings in both conferences. Some teams are trying to stop losing streaks, while others want to protect their home floors. From an early afternoon clash in Philadelphia to a late-night tip in Utah, every matchup brings its own pressure and story. Here is a clear look at the games and the teams most likely to come out on top. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Spectrum Center, Charlotte\n\nWashington enters on a rough stretch. The Wizards are 1-9 in their last 10 games and are allowing over 120 points per game in that span. Injuries have hit them hard, with Marvin Bagley III, Bilal Coulibaly, and Trae Young all sidelined. Scoring has become a problem without steady shooting and rebounding depth.\n\nCharlotte is more stable at home and already beat Washington 126-109 in their last meeting. LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller continue to drive the offense, while Kon Knueppel is shooting over 48 percent from the field. The Hornets also defend better than Washington and force tougher shots. The double-digit spread reflects the gap in form and health. Charlotte should control this game from the second quarter onward.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nPhiladelphia comes off an overtime win against Houston, but their recent run is mixed at 5-5 in the last 10 games. Tyrese Maxey remains the main scoring threat, and Joel Embiid has been steady but not dominant in recent outings.\n\nNew York has struggled against teams above .500, yet their shooting profile gives them an edge here. The Knicks average nearly 15 made three-pointers per game, which is more than Philadelphia usually allows. Karl-Anthony Towns leads them with over 20 points and 11 rebounds per game. The narrow spread shows how close this matchup is. Shot-making from deep and rebounding could tilt it toward New York late.\n\nPredicted winner: New York Knicks\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Target Center, Minneapolis\n\nMinnesota has lost four straight games and has shown defensive leaks during that run. They still score well, averaging 120 points per game on the season, but stopping elite shooters remains a concern.\n\nGolden State enters in better rhythm, winning six of its last ten. Stephen Curry continues to hit close to four threes per game, and the Warriors average over 122 points recently. The Timberwolves won the last meeting, but Curry scored 39 in that game. The plus points suggest a close contest. Experience and perimeter shooting give Golden State a real chance to steal this one on the road.\n\nPredicted winner: Golden State Warriors\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nCleveland just beat Charlotte while holding them under 90 points. Donovan Mitchell led the way with 24 points, and the Cavs grabbed 60 rebounds in that game. Their defense forces turnovers and limits clean looks from three.\n\nOrlando is coming off a heavy loss to Charlotte, allowing over 54 percent shooting. Paolo Banchero scored 23, but the Magic were outworked on both ends. Cleveland ranks sixth in scoring at over 119 points per game and also forces nearly 16 turnovers per night. With better form and more reliable shooting, Cleveland looks ready to edge Orlando even as a slight underdog.\n\nPredicted winner: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nBoston is strong on defense and sits second in the league in points allowed. Jaylen Brown just scored 30 against Indiana, while the team shot over 92 percent from the free-throw line. Their balance between scoring and defense keeps them steady on the road.\n\nChicago plays fast and ranks high in assists, but their defense gives up nearly 120 points per game. Coby White leads the offense, yet the Bulls allow too many open looks from outside. Boston’s ability to control pace and rebound should matter here. The small spread favors the more disciplined team. Boston should pull away late in the fourth.\n\nPredicted winner: Boston Celtics\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center, Dallas\n\nDallas has won three straight at home and has gone 7-3 in its last ten games. Cooper Flagg leads the team in scoring and rebounds, while Naji Marshall has added steady points in recent games. The Mavericks shoot well and protect home court better than their overall record suggests.\n\nLos Angeles relies heavily on Luka Doncic, who is averaging over 33 points per game. The Lakers, however, are 4-6 in their last ten and have struggled with consistency. Dallas lost the first meeting, but this setting favors the home side. The points advantage and recent form make Dallas a solid pick.\n\nPredicted winner: Dallas Mavericks\n\nDate: Saturday, January 24, 2026\n\nVenue: Delta Center, Salt Lake City\n\nUtah has been leaky on defense but still scores well, averaging over 117 points per game in the last ten. Keyonte George leads the attack with more than 24 points per game. Home games have been more competitive for the Jazz.\n\nMiami struggles on the road with an 8-15 away record. Their shooting has dipped below 44 percent in recent games, and they allow over 121 points per contest in the last ten. Utah’s pace and scoring should test Miami’s defense. The plus points suggest value on the home team. Utah has the edge in this matchup.\n\nJanuary 24 have some good games overall. Charlotte, Boston, and Cleveland look well positioned, while underdogs like Golden State, Dallas, and Utah have strong upset potential based on form and matchup stats. Fans should expect high-scoring games in Minnesota and Utah, with tighter contests in Philadelphia and Orlando.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 24: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Over his 23 years in the NBA, LeBron James has had many rivals who have tried to get under his skin. However, arguably, none of them have been as successful in recent history as Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks, a hard-nosed defensive specialist with erratic habits, someone who has consistently gotten a reaction out of the King. Now, Brooks has publicly addressed his tactics.\n\n“If this was LeBron, maybe five years ago, then it’d be different,” Brooks said about James to Twitch streamer Agent during a recent appearance on his livestream. “Miami Bron, you’re not really talking shit to him for real, cause then it’s like, blow by, dunk. He’s got more game to him, more agile. Right now, he’s like, like I’ve always been saying, he’s old.”\n\nFor Brooks, it’s clear that trash talk is just one more tactic that he uses as a part of his defensive identity, and a situational way to disrupt rhythm and force opposing stars into emotionally engage with him. Whether that approach is criticized or lauded has never seemed much to matter to him.\n\nWith the Phoenix Suns, even as he experiences as increased offensive role which averaging career-highs across the board, Brooks’ defensive edge hasn’t softened. He presented his mindset as preparation, something he’s seen doing frequently before games, and a belief that every aspect of his opponent’s temperament and limitations factor into being able to stop them on defense.\n\n“You can press up on him,” Brooks continued on James. “You can cut him off spots so you know his moves he’s going to do. So you can always chirp a little bit. For some reason, he likes to do a little chirping… I got like quick twitch back.”\n\nWhen the Phoenix Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers met earlier this season, the tension between LeBron James and Dillon brooks was evident throughout the game. Brooks drew the James assignment for most of the game, playing extremely physically, crowding his space and talking throughout the night as the matchup felt almost playoff-like in it’s edge.\n\nOne key possession highlighted the double-edged approach of Brooks’ tactics. With just over 12 seconds left in the game, the Suns forward drilled a go-ahead three right in James’ face, seemingly validating his approach.\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards, James seemingly rolled over Brooks, resulting in a no-call, causing the two to get briefly entangled. Brooks was quickly assessed his second technical following this exchange and was ejected, a sequence that eventually snowballed into handing the Lakers a win from the late advantage.\n\nLooking back, this game clearly reads as a real-time example of everything Brooks talked about on stream with Agent. He pressed up on James, cut off his preferred spots, leaned into constant chatter, and while James ultimately sealed the win late, the exchange highlighted why every matchup between the two is primetime.\n\nBrooks isn’t just challenging perhaps the greatest player in league history, but actively pushing the margins of engaging against superstars.\n\nThe post Dillon Brooks Takes Aim at Aging LeBron James While Explaining Trash Talk Tactics appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "On the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback with Ian Begley, SNY's NBA Insider and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype discuss Karl-Anthony Towns trade rumors and potential deadline deals.",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NBA trade deadline arriving on Feb. 5, there are plenty of questions surrounding the Knicks and their NBA Finals expectations.\n\nNew York snapped their four-game losing streak in an impressive win over the Nets on Wednesday night, but the team is still in the midst of one of its worst stretches in the Jalen Brunson era. With the win, they are 3-9 over their last 12 games and have fallen into the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference -- they would be the four-seed if they didn't hold the tiebreaker over the Raptors.\n\nSo, as the Knicks look to improve the roster, what should fans be looking for? SNY NBA Insider Ian Begley spoke on the topic on the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback, where he and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype broke down what they are hearing as the trade deadline gets closer.\n\nAfter the Knicks' dreadful loss to the undermanned Mavericks at home on Monday, Newsday's Steve Popper reported that New York had spoken to a number of teams (Hornets, Grizzlies, Magic) about a potential trade involving Towns.\n\nTowns' numbers are down pretty much across the board and the big man even admitted that he's had a tough time adjusting to head coach Mike Brown's system.\n\nBegley shared on The Putback what he had heard.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations about trading Karl-Anthony Towns,\" Begley said. \"As of Monday, it was not happening. As far as something in the aftermath of that Dallas loss, no, that wasn’t the case.\"\n\nBegley added that if the Knicks go through another 2-9 stretch and continue to struggle as they get closer to the trade deadline, things might change.\n\nWhenever Towns' name is thrown out there as a trade candidate, the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is not far behind. It seems like an easy swap for both teams, but Scotto threw some cold water on the idea.\n\n“I personally never gotten the sense, at least from talking to my sources, that a team like the Milwaukee Bucks would be overly aggressive in trying to get Karl Towns in a Giannis Antetokounmpo package, theoretically,\" Scotto said.\n\nScotto suggested that the Knicks, if they were to deal Towns, would have to consider \"breaking up\" Towns' salary into multiple pieces, similar to what the Timberwolves did when they moved the big man to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations on trading Karl-Anthony Towns\"\n\nOn The Putback with @IanBegley, Ian discusses what he's heard on the KAT reports and his read on if the Knicks would make that trade pic.twitter.com/bvLAdFjzt2\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 22, 2026\n\nSince a Towns trade is unlikely, what players should we be on the lookout for?\n\nGuerschon Yabusele is as likely a candidate to be moved. According to Scotto, the acquisition was seen as a \"homerun\" by execs in the offseason, but it was made before the hiring of Brown. Clearly, Yabusele has had a tough time integrating into Brown's system, and the Knicks are looking to shop him. Scotto even suggested the Knicks may have to pair Yabusele with another minimum-salary player or draft picks to get a player that could help the team.\n\nScotto shared that the Pelicans have two players that the Knicks checked in.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were calling not only on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans but also Yves Missi,\" Scotto said. \"Part of it could be doing background, doing due diligence, but you don't make calls on these guys unless you're intersted so that raised my antenna a little bit. If you take Yabusele and another minimum guy, you could maybe try to make something happen there.\"\n\nThe Knicks' interest in Alvarado is well-documented by Missi is a name that even Begley was surprised by.\n\nMissi, 21, is a second-year center who has seen his minutes deep in year two. In his rookie campaign, Missi played around 27 minutes a game (73 games), averaging nine points, and eight rebounds (3.5 offensive). In his sophomore year, Missi is averaging 19 minutes and just 5.5 points and 5.5 rebounds (2.9 offensive) across 38 games.\n\nAcquiring another big like Missi could open up more avenues for deals involving the Knicks. Would they deal Mitchell Robinson, who is on the final year of his contract, or one of the depth bigs like Ariel Hukporti? That also opens up the possibility to trade Towns as well.\n\nThe Knicks have a lot to consider as they hope to fortify their roster for the final stretch of the regular season and the playoffs.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were not only calling on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans, but also Yves Missi\"\n\nOn today's episode of The Putback, @MikeAScotto - a must-follow for NBA fans - discusses trade deadline (link to full show in post below) pic.twitter.com/11wdozjICd\n\n— Ian Begley (@IanBegley) January 22, 2026",

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA player says dating Khloe Kardashian 'derailed' his career originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer NBA guard Rashad McCants says his brief relationship with Khloe Kardashian came at a cost he believes went far beyond tabloid attention. In his view, the timing and culture of the league during his playing days turned off-court visibility into a professional liability.\n\nMcCants, who was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2005, has said that players in his era were expected to keep a low profile unless they were established superstars. Any perceived distraction, he argues, could quickly be held against someone still trying to secure a foothold in the league.\n\nMORE: Miami fans think adult film star Abella Danger is dating Carson Beck because of a viral fake tweet\n\nSpeaking with Basketball Network’s Nick Raguz, McCants explained how celebrity relationships were viewed differently before the rise of social media and player branding. “Before, it was a distraction,” he said. “The powers didn’t want players doing anything outside of the NBA that would be considered a distraction. You didn’t see a lot of guys dating celebrities unless they were high-profile players.”\n\nAccording to McCants, that distinction mattered. Playing in a small market while dating someone already famous brought scrutiny he felt he couldn’t afford. “For me, not being a high-profile guy and being in Minnesota, it was more of a distraction than a compliment,” he said. “I was one of the early bloomers for all of those things, and it didn’t help my situation.”\n\nOn the court, McCants’ NBA run was short and uneven. Injuries and inconsistent minutes limited his opportunities, and he averaged 9.9 points per game across four seasons with the Timberwolves. As teams turned over rosters and leaned toward younger players, his role diminished, and his NBA career ended after the 2008-09 season.\n\nMORE: Klay Thompson shows up to support Megan Thee Stallion's latest Dunkin promo\n\nThe former guard also pointed to how much the league has changed since then. Today’s NBA encourages players to build brands, embrace social media, and expand their visibility, regardless of market size. In McCants’ telling, that shift highlights how different the environment was when he was trying to establish himself.",

    "fullText": "As we hit the halfway point in the NBA schedule, the Los Angeles Clippers finally seem to be salvaging their season, but that progress will be tested tonight when they host the Los Angeles Lakers at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe Battle of L.A. season series sits at 1-1 heading into this matchup, and my Lakers vs. Clippers predictions expect LeBron James to be one of the swing factors.\n\nLet's dive right into my NBA picks for Thursday, January 22.\n\nLakers vs Clippers best bet: LeBron James Over 12.5 rebounds + assists (-112 bet365)\n\nLeBron James' injury issues may point to a 41-year-old in his 23rd season, but his stat lines suggest he’s got something left in the tank. James has been able to keep his sciatica and arthritis at bay while starting 2026 with a bang, so look for his fingerprints to be all over tonight’s clash with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nWith Luka Doncic doing so much of the scoring for the Los Angeles Lakers, I’m targeting LeBron’s rebounds and assists here, and he’s gone past this combo O/U number in four of his past five outings.\n\nJames has been getting the job done in both these categories so far this month, with averages of 7.7 RPG and 7.6 APG in January, and he was closing in on a triple-double in L.A.’s win over the Denver Nuggets earlier this week.\n\nUntil Austin Reaves returns, LeBron is going to have a larger share of the playmaking, particularly when Luka is on the bench, and there’s just not a lot of secondary ball-handling in the current rotation. Equally, he’s got a big role to play alongside Deandre Ayton on the boards.\n\nAt this stage of his career, James can still do the little things that drive winning, and the Lakers will need all of that veteran savvy to hold off their cross-city rivals tonight.\n\nThe Lakers are 7-3 SU in their last 10 meetings with the Clippers, and an impressive 14-8 on the road this season. With Kawhi Leonard still listed as questionable, the burden on James Harden could once again be massive, and the hosts gave up 138 points to the Chicago Bulls this week.\n\nHarden continues to put up big numbers, and I’ll take the Over on his rebounds prop here. He’s grabbed 4+ boards in six of his last seven games, and the Clippers will gladly keep him closer to the rim if it avoids the Luka defensive assignment.\n\nIvica Zubac has had some miserable possessions trying to guard Doncic on switches in the past, but the Clippers will lean on him for big minutes here. Zubac has posted three straight double-doubles, and he’s finished with 11+ rebounds in his last four games.\n\nSpread: Lakers -1.5 (+100) | Clippers +1.5 (-120)\n\nMoneyline: Lakers -110 | Clippers -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 223.5 (-110) | Under 223.5 (-110)\n\nThe Lakers are 5-2 ATS in the last seven meetings between these teams.

    "fullText": "Thursday night brings one of the busiest NBA slates of the week. January 22 features playoff contenders, rising young teams, and a few matchups that could swing late with one hot quarter. Home court, recent form, and injury updates all play a role in shaping how these games may unfold. So, let’s have a look around each game of the night. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nOrlando enters this game with a strong home record. The Magic are 14-7 at home and sit near the top of the Southeast Division. Free throw scoring is their biggest strength. They lead the league with 22 made free throws per game, which often keeps them ahead late.\n\nCharlotte has struggled with consistency. The Hornets are 16-28 and have dropped multiple road games this season. Three-point shooting remains their main weapon, ranking third in makes per game. Defensive issues continue to hurt them, especially allowing high shooting percentages.\n\nOrlando’s defense limits perimeter shots well, allowing under 12 threes per game. That directly challenges Charlotte’s main scoring path. The Magic also hold an edge in recent form despite a rough loss to Memphis.\n\nPredicted winner: Orlando Magic\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nHouston has quietly been one of the better road rebounding teams. They lead the West in offensive rebounds, which helps offset shooting slumps. Even with key injuries, the Rockets control the glass well.\n\nPhiladelphia remains dangerous at home but has been inconsistent. Tyrese Maxey continues to carry the scoring load, averaging 30 points. Joel Embiid is listed day to day, which impacts interior defense and scoring balance.\n\nThe Rockets shoot nearly 48 percent from the field, which is slightly above what Philadelphia usually allows. Houston also comes into this game on a three-game winning streak, while the Sixers are hovering around .500 at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nWashington has one of the weakest defenses in the league. They allow over 123 points per game and struggle to contain efficient offenses. Home games have not helped much, as they remain below .500 in Washington.\n\nDenver has been excellent on the road. The Nuggets are 17-7 away from home and average over 121 points per game. Even with Nikola Jokic sidelined, Jamal Murray has stepped up in recent games.\n\nThe Nuggets already beat the Wizards earlier this month. That win came by six points and featured strong perimeter shooting. Washington has also dropped eight of its last ten games, which points to ongoing problems.\n\nPredicted winner: Denver Nuggets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center\n\nGolden State is on a four-game winning streak and scoring at a high level. Over the last ten games, the Warriors average more than 123 points per night. Ball movement and three-point volume remain elite.\n\nDallas has talent but remains injury-hit. Several key rotation players are out, including Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis. Cooper Flagg has played well, yet the Mavericks struggle defensively against strong shooting teams.\n\nGolden State already beat Dallas earlier this season by double digits. The Warriors also rank near the top in made threes per game, while Dallas allows one of the highest three-point totals in the West.\n\nPredicted winner: Golden State Warriors\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nMinnesota has been dominant at home with a 15-6 record. The Timberwolves score heavily in the paint and have multiple scoring options. Anthony Edwards continues to average close to 30 points per game.\n\nChicago scores well but struggles defensively on the road. The Bulls allow 120 points per game, which becomes a problem against high-tempo teams. Minnesota already beat Chicago by 35 points earlier this season.\n\nThe Timberwolves are also trying to stop a three-game losing streak. That adds urgency to their performance at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nSan Antonio has been one of the most balanced teams in the West. They move the ball well and rank high in assists per game. Victor Wembanyama continues to anchor both ends of the floor.\n\nUtah allows the most points in the league. Defensive issues remain a constant problem. Even after a strong scoring night from Keyonte George, the Jazz still struggle to close games.\n\nThe Spurs already beat Utah earlier this week by double digits. San Antonio also holds a clear edge in efficiency and defensive rating.\n\nPredicted winner: San Antonio Spurs\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nThis matchup remains tight every season. The Clippers won the last meeting by 15 points. Home court has helped them recently, winning three straight in Inglewood.\n\nThe Lakers rely heavily on Luka Doncic and LeBron James. They perform well in close games, staying undefeated in contests decided by fewer than four points. Injuries remain a concern, especially in the backcourt.\n\nThe Clippers score less overall but defend better at home. That balance explains the narrow line.\n\nPredicted winner: Los Angeles Clippers\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nPortland has won eight of its last ten games and plays well at home. Rebounding has been a major strength, led by Donovan Clingan. The Trail Blazers also limit opponent scoring better than earlier in the season.\n\nMiami struggles on the road with an 8-14 record. Shooting efficiency has dipped over the last ten games. Tyler Herro remains out, which reduces scoring punch.\n\nPortland already lost a close game to Miami earlier this season. Recent form suggests a different outcome this time.\n\nPredicted winner: Portland Trail Blazers\n\nJanuary 22 is packed with games that could quietly shift the standings. Some favorites look steady, while a few underdogs have enough momentum to keep things close. Home floors matter tonight, especially in Minnesota, Denver, and Orlando. Late games in Los Angeles and Portland may come down to execution in the final minutes. It is a slate where smart matchups matter more than big names.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 22: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",
