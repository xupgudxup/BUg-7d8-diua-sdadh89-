    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

    "title": "Chiefs’ Andy Reid is ‘fired up’ about new staff: ‘Change can be good’",
    "description": "Kansas City’s head coach is optimistic about the coaching shakeup.",
    "fullText": "For the first time in eight years, the Kansas City Chiefs were not involved in Sunday’s NFL doubleheader of conference championships. Head coach Andy Reid has been a staple of both the AFC and NFC title games throughout his career, so with his 2025 team unable to even make the postseason, a change around him was not a surprising result.\n\nThe offensive coordinator spot has officially been turned over to Eric Bienemy, despite former coordinator Matt Nagy still searching for his next job. In total, five positions on the offensive coaching staff have been vacated since the end of last season. So far, the only official hire is Bienemy, but Reid made it clear he’s excited about the new chapter during a Zoom call with local media on Monday.\n\nAndy's got great energy in this presser. Good to see him so lively. He's ready to get back to work\n\n— Ron Kopp Jr (@RonOnChiefs) January 26, 2026\n\nAfter a few spirited answers, Reid was asked about the noticeable energy in his words.\n\n“I’m fired up to get in this offseason and get going,” Reid responded. “We didn’t do very well this past year, and that has not been our MO here. So I want to fix the problems we had in all phases. There will be people that move on, people that come in… change can be good sometimes for you, so that’s what I’m fired up about.”\n\nSome will point at Bieniemy’s history with Reid and Kansas City as hardly a “change,” but his style is objectively different than Nagy’s. Reid acknowledged that and emphasized how Bieniemy straightforwardly communicates with players and coaches, including star quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\n“I’d tell you EB will be very direct with him,” Reid shared. “[Mahomes] knows it’s coming from a place of knowledge there.”\n\nStill, there will be criticism that the change needed was in reference to his offensive scheme. Reid would agree that it needs a refresh — or a retooling, as he foreshadowed in December — so that’s what he hopes the newest hires help with.\n\n“Everywhere you go in this business, you pick something up,” Reid explained. “You might take it with you, or you might say, ‘I don’t want to do that.‘”\n\n“I welcome that, I always keep my ears and eyes open for things,” Reid assured. “That’s why we’re very seldom stagnant, and why, even with our record, I felt I could stand in front of you guys and go ‘listen, what worked for us the year before, it just flipped on us.’ That’s sometimes how this thing works, so now it’s making sure we get back and do the right things, correct some things, and then get them going in the right direction again.”\n\nIn the modern age of accessible information, Reid reminded those listening that new ideas can be introduced without further hiring. It just takes effort and willingness.\n\n“You use all the technology that’s out there,” Reid pointed out. “There is no reason to be stagnant; you have too many different options, you shouldn’t have to bring in the latest, greatest here and there, all that. You have all that right at a finger tip for you, if you go that route.”\n\nThere will likely be little change in the chain of command for calling a play into Mahomes, but that’s because it is already a collaborative process. The positive change will simply be the new voices.\n\n“I still enjoy calling plays,” Reid admitted. “But what I do, I’m also not afraid to delegate and get opinions from people. Even in certain situations, letting them go ahead and call things in different areas. We do this jointly. I keep it open, and I’ve felt that’s the best way. I want guys to contribute, I want them to work hard and be experts in their area, and then accumulate in all areas. I’ve always mixed and matched there, and it seemed to have been fairly productive.”\n\nThe change is welcomed by many in Kansas City. The head coach’s enthusiasm and upbeat energy when talking about the transition prove that it is already reinvigorating the people it needs to.",

    "fullText": "Jessica Pegula avoided wearing a Kansas City Chiefs jersey as she defeated Madison Keys to end her fellow podcast host’s Australia Open title defence.\n\nPegula will play another American in fourth seed Amanda Anisimova in the quarter-finals after reaching the last-eight in Melbourne for the fourth time.\n\nThe 31-year-old sixth seed is good friends with Keys, who won her first grand slam title at the Australian Open last year, and they host The Player's Box podcast together along with Jennifer Brady and Desirae Krawczyk.\n\nThey recorded an episode before their fourth-round match, and decided the winner would choose a forfeit for the loser.\n\nKeys decided that if she won, Pegula, whose parents own the NFL team the Buffalo Bills, would have had to wear a Chiefs jersey with Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift on the back.\n\nIn ensuring she avoided wearing the colours of the source of Buffalo’s recent post-season woes, Pegula will instead make Keys eat an apple pie topped with melted cheese.\n\n“I had a lot of motivation today,” Pegula said after her 6-3 6-4 victory over Keys, with the pair remaining in good spirits as they were seen chatting in the gym post-match as Pegula avoided the forfeit.\n\n“That was bad,\" said Pegula. \"She was, like, 'Mine's worse'. I was, like, 'What are you talking about? My family owns the Bills. This team has owned us in the post-season'.\n\n“All she has to do is eat a piece of pie. What is the big deal? I think that was really some extra motivation, because that would have been a tough moment for me.”\n\nPegula said the apple pie topped with cheddar cheese was her family's Thanksgiving tradition.\n\n\"A bet is a bet, so I'll do it,\" said Keys. \"I hope it's less gross than I think it's going to be, but we will find out, I guess.\"\n\nKeys, meanwhile, is set to drop out of the world’s top 10 after her fourth-round exit but said she was proud of how she had handle the experience of returning as defending champion.\n\n“It's obviously not the way that I wanted things to end here, but I'm still really proud of myself,” Keys said\n\n“I think coming back, being defending champion, dealing with all of the extra pressure and nerves, I'm just really proud of myself for how I handled it.\n\n“Just one of those days where I feel like Jess beat me, and I can kind of walk away with my head held high.”\n\nPegula is bidding to win her first grand slam title, having coming closest at the US Open with an appearance in the final and semi-finals in the last two seasons.\n\nBut she is yet to drop a set so far and will be confident when she meets another US Open runner-up in Anisimova, who is bidding to win her first grand slam title after defeats in the finals of Wimbledon and the US Open last season.\n\n“I'm just really happy that the work that I've done with my coaches,” Pegula said. “I really believe in that and what we have done, and to be able to kind of execute that stuff in a grand slam, second tournament of the year for me, will give me a lot of confidence, not just here but just going into the year.\n\n“I have always been the type of player where I get frustrated when I feel like I'm not getting better. And I still think that at my age, I've already had a lot of really great results. Being 31, I still feel like I'm improving as a player. So that is what gets me the most excited.”",

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs continue their coaching staff shake-up with another significant change. Head coach Andy Reid continues to readjust his staff after recently parting ways with long-time associate Todd Pinkson.\n\nAccording to the Kansas City Star's Sam McDowell, Pinkston was let go after being hired by the team in 2023. The former wide receiver under Reid with the Philadelphia Eagles won a Super Bowl title with the Chiefs in his first season on the staff.\n\nThere are four changes to the Chiefs coaching staff so far, per sources:\n\nThey have fired RBs coach Todd Pinkston and WRs coach Connor Embree.\n\nLouie Addazio chose to move on for the OL job at UNLV. Alex Whittingham has joined the Michigan staff.\n\nCould be more after the carousel…\n\n— Sam McDowell (@SamMcDowell11) January 15, 2026\n\nThe Chiefs have already parted ways with wide receiver coach Conner Embree and will be welcoming Eric Bieniemy as their new offensive coordinator. Pinkston's history with Reid dates back to his playing days, showing his loyalty to the system and signaling drastic changes after a disappointing 2025 season.\n\nKansas City's running game lacked explosion all season due to injuries, and big plays were rare from the position. Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco led the team in rushing, with Hunt finishing with 611 yards and Pacheco with 462 yards. Rookie running back Brashard Smith contributed with 151 yards on the ground but proved to be a versatile threat in the passing game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kansas City Chiefs part ways with longtime Andy Reid associate",

    "fullText": "The future of the Kansas City Chiefs’ new home stadium is in jeopardy after a recent committee meeting involving Kansas lawmakers. The Chiefs announced plans for a new $3 billion domed stadium in December, where they proposed public ownership of the arena, as a significant percentage of the funding would be secured through sales tax revenue (STAR) bonds.\n\nHence, when questions were raised about why the stadium wasn’t privately owned, Chiefs attorney Korb Maxwell issued a statement confirming that, without public ownership, the proposal wouldn’t make sense for the franchise.\n\n“If that (stadium) is not owned by a sports authority, if that is owned in private hands, then, if you would have $1.8 billion of STAR bonds come into that development, that would all be federally income taxed,” Maxwell said, as per the Kansas City Business Journal. “And so you would take, then, 45% of the dollars that came in and roughly ship that to Washington, D.C. … That would blow a huge hole in the budget for this project and, frankly, would not allow it to move forward.”\n\nAs explained by Korb Maxwell, private ownership would entail that the $1.8 billion in sales tax revenue (STAR) bonds could not be issued for the Chiefs’ stadium on a tax-exempt basis. This would lead to a massive hit on the franchise’s budget for the stadium and, hence, would push the Chiefs to move away from their proposed plan.\n\nThese questions about public ownership of the stadium stem from the possibility of what would happen if the Kansas City Chiefs, who will be taking care of the arena, decide to leave. Responding to these concerns, the Chiefs’ attorney reiterated the franchise’s long-term plans for the stadium.\n\n“We’re absolutely doing this and planning this as the long, long-term home for the Kansas City Chiefs for (multiple) generations,” Maxwell said, as per theKansas City Business Journal.\n\nWith this statement, the Chiefs seem adamant about securing public ownership for their new stadium, as they believe this venture will be prosperous for the state of Kansas.\n\nAs plans for the new Kansas City Chiefs stadium were unveiled, team owner Clark Hunt shared why this decision to move from Arrowhead was taken. In his statement, Hunt explained how this new project will significantly benefit the fans and the state of Kansas.\n\n“We made a decision as a family that this was the right opportunity and the best for the organization for several reasons,” Hunt said. “It’s about the fans. My dad [Lamar Hunt, who founded the franchise] was always about the fans and thinking about the future.”\n\n“This will give Chiefs Kingdom a state-of-the-art facility for multiple generations, a building that can last for at least 50 or 60 years. We believe it’s the best thing for the region. It will give Kansas City the opportunity to bid on events that we can’t host right now, like the Super Bowl, the College Football Playoff, and the NCAA Final Fours.”\n\nAs the Chiefs navigate the complex financing structure for their proposed $3 billion domed stadium, the franchise’s commitment to public ownership appears non-negotiable due to federal tax implications. Whether Kansas lawmakers will approve the necessary STAR bonds remains to be seen, but the Hunt family has made clear its vision extends generations into the future.\n\nThe post Chiefs Threaten Kansas Exit Over $3 Billion Dispute as Clark Hunt & Ownership Demand a ‘Landlord’ for New Stadium appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Titans opt for another candidate, keeping Nagy in Kansas City amidst offensive struggles and potential Mahomes absence.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs won’t need to go looking for another offensive coordinator, at least for now, as current OC Matt Nagy lost out to Robert Salah to become the next head coach of the Tennessee Titans on Tuesday.\n\nNagy interviewed with the Titans over a week ago, causing many rumors of a departure to Tennessee that’d force the Chiefs to find a new OC in 2026. Perhaps that wouldn’t be the worst outcome for Kansas City, however, as the last couple of seasons haven’t been great in Kansas City on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nWe've completed in-person interviews with the following candidates. pic.twitter.com/Mctvgl2U5K\n\n— Tennessee Titans (@Titans) January 20, 2026\n\nThere was no sign of the same dominant offense in Kansas City this past season. The Chiefs finished the season with 320.6 yards per game, only enough for 20th in the NFL. It’s only the second time the Chiefs haven't finished with at least 350 yards per game since Mahomes took over at QB.\n\nIt becomes even more alarming with the fact that the other season under 350 yards per game was in 2024, meaning the offense hasn’t been great in Kansas City for two consecutive seasons now. There’s no denying that the Chiefs, despite their dominance in the early 2020s, no longer instill the same fear into opponents from the offensive side of the ball.\n\nIt’s unfair to say the offensive troubles last season were entirely the fault of Nagy, however. In 2025, injuries and suspensions played a big role in the Chiefs’ failures. It’s why Nagy has garnered a lot of interest this offseason as a name to fill the head coaching vacancies around the league.\n\nNagy has been with the Chiefs for several years, first starting with the team back in 2013. After his stint as the head coach for the Bears, Nagy immediately returned to Kansas City, playing a role in its last three Super Bowl appearances.\n\nIt looks like he’ll be returning once again in 2026 despite the interest from the Titans, who ultimately chose Salejh, the defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. With Mahomes likely out for at least a portion of the 2026 season and several other question marks surrounding the offense, Nagy will certainly have his hands full come fall. In an offseason where there are looking to be several huge changes to the team, the Chiefs being able to keep Nagy will come as a breath of fresh air for the front office.",

    "description": "The Kansas City backfield stands to benefit from Bieniemy’s return.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs are reuniting with former offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy after a disappointing 2025 season that resulted in a major shakeup in the coaching staff.\n\nBieniemy’s 2025 season was the opposite: he was hired to coach the running backs for the Chicago Bears and first-year head coach Ben Johnson, who was the hottest name among offensive-minded candidates in last year’s coaching carousel. Chicago won the NFC North and beat the division-rival Green Bay Packers in the playoffs by leaning heavily on a top-10 offense.\n\nWhile quarterback Caleb Williams proved capable of leading a high-powered unit, it was the rushing attack that drove the offense to be one of the NFL’s best. As a team, the Bears averaged the third-most rushing yards per attempt (4.9). Lead running back D’Andre Swift set a career high in rushing yards (1,087) and touchdowns (9).\n\nHowever, the performance of rookie running back Kyle Monangai — a seventh-round pick — was the strongest example of Bieniemy’s influence. The downhill runner racked up 783 rushing yards in the regular season, averaging less than 10 attempts per game. He finished with the 24th-most rushing yards in the NFL, and the fifth-most among a productive class of backs.\n\nHis first breakout game was in Week 7, when he averaged 6.2 yards per carry and scored over 13 attempts. In the wake of that win, Monangai explained that Bieniemy’s coaching style resonated with him.\n\n“I don’t try to see how I would fit a coach’s coach style. I kind of just receive the coach and how it’s taken,” Monangai said. “It just so happens the way he coaches is how I’ve been coached my whole life. Guys  that demand a lot of you and maybe be a little vocal, as you guys get to hear on a daily basis. But yeah, he coaches as hard, he demands a lot out of us, but he does it because he knows we can do it. I think I respond to the way he coaches, and I just take everything he does and try to apply to my game and execute.”\n\nIn that same week, Monangai shared a coaching point from Bieniemy that hit home and was emphasized to all of the Chicago backfield.\n\n“You’ll hear E.B. say all the time, ‘Find four and a half’ (yards per carry). He’s not too concerned with everything number-wise or big picture. He just says whatever play we’re on is the most important, and if the ball’s in your hand, you’ve got to find four and a half.”\n\nTwo weeks later, the rookie gashed the Cincinnati Bengals for 176 yards over 24 carries. A month after that, Monangai ran for 130 yards to help topple the Philadelphia Eagles on the road.\n\nSince the upstart rookie played collegiately at Rutgers, the easy comparison has been the former seventh-round pick and starting running back of the Chiefs, Isiah Pacheco. However, Bieniemy pointed to another back in Kansas City when asked for a comparison.\n\n“When I first had an opportunity to watch Kyle, he reminded me of someone, not myself,” Bieniemy said. “Reminds me of Kareem Hunt, and watching him and studying him on tape, going back to my days of reviewing tape on Kareem, those two are very, very similar. That’s the person that I see. Now, he has a lot to live up to because Kareem has had an outstanding career, but the kid takes a tremendous amount of pride in the little things, so that’s important. Now we just got to continue to grow.”\n\nHunt was a third-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, leading the NFL in rushing as a rookie with Bieniemy as his position coach.\n\nWith Bieniemy now focusing on getting the most out of the Chiefs’ backfield, Monangai’s rookie rushing total puts the offense’s subpar 2025 season into perspective: 783 rushing yards — the second-most on the Bears — would have led Kansas City in each of the last two years.\n\nThere is plenty of hands-on coaching needed across the Chiefs’ offense for the coordinator. However, the run game needs to be especially sharpened. The scheme and playcalling factor into that improvement, but Bieniemy’s ability to get the most out of an individual may factor in as well. Monangai responded to his coaching by dramatically outplaying his 233rd overall selection.",

    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes continues to rehab after surgery on his knee. He spoke with reporters recently, discussing the importance of his relationship with Assistant Athletic Trainer Julie Frymyer when dealing with the injury.\n\n“I think it’s extremely important because what I’ve found out throughout this process is not every day is going to feel amazing,” said Mahomes, “There’s some days you’re going to be sore or some days you’re going to feel stiff, but you have to have someone you trust that’s going to get the best out of you, that’s going to keep you safeand someone that’s going to push you more than anything. Some days I want to go in there and crush rehab (and) some days I just want to get through it, but she (Assistant Athletic Trainer Julie Frymyer) doesn’t let you have the get through it days.”\n\nMahomes has shown trust in Frymyer off the field, as she co-starred with him in a recent State Farm commercial alongside singer Meghan Trainor.\n\n“She pushes you to be the best every single day. It’s been a different process, kind of jumping right into working out like this,” said Mahomes, “I always worked out, built up throughout the offseason, but it’s been fun to be with people that care about me, and that want to push me to be the best that I can be. I’m in that training room every single day, and I’m trying to make sure that I’m ready to go as quickly as possible.”\n\nKansas City’s medical staff will be hard at work this offseason to get the franchise quarterback up and running ahead of the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Patrick Mahomes discusses strong trust in the Chiefs’ training staff",

I thought we had great discipline, we went the tough route and didn't go for any cheap fixes.\n\n\"You've got to look at how hard the forwards and backs worked and the quality of the set-piece was the foundation of it, turning over lineouts and that kind of stuff.\n\n\"I thought we were fantastic with our territory, our kicking game and credit to the forwards with the mauls, the pick and go stuff. We were on it in that first half, that's for sure.\n\n\"Cardiff got a foot in the game but we always stayed in the fight, never gave up on anything and came back with a nice bonus point try, then to get another try at the end was excellent.\"\n\nExeter: Woodburn; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Haydon-Wood, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Varney; Sio, Dweba, Tchumbadze, Jenkins, Zambonin, Hooper, E Roots, James.\n\nReplacements: Heaven, Goodrick-Clarke, J Roots, Tuima, Pearson, Capstick, Chapman, Hammersley.\n\nCardiff: Beetham; Grady, Smit, Jennings, Bowen; I Lloyd, Mulder; Southworth, E Lloyd, Wainwright, McNally, Thornton, Botham, Thomas, Basham.\n\nReplacements: Hughes, Domachowski, Sebastian, Nott, Lawrence, Cottle, Davies, Winnett.",

He worked alongside defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, helping produce a 2024 unit that dominated many categories in the NFL.\n\nAddazio secured his first coaching role at Ohio State as a graduate assistant on the offensive line in 2017. He served previously as an intern for the Buckeyes for one year. He coached tight ends at Bowling Green in 2019, then at Colorado State in 2020 and 2021.\n\nQuality Control coaches provide crucial support with film breakdown, game planning, and scouting for the offensive and defensive coordinators. Addazio has a new opportunity in the college ranks, similar to that of his former staff colleague, Alex Whittingham, who recently joined his father's staff at the University of Michigan.\n\nThe Chiefs will look to replace another staff member as the offseason rolls on and teams continue to make changes around the league.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Former Kansas City Chiefs Coach joins the UNLV coaching staff",

    "fullText": "Patrick Mahomes makes feelings about Matt Nagy perfectly clear originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are in rare territory.\n\nFor the first time in over a decade, the team did not make the playoffs. Star quarterback Patrick Mahomes also went down with a season-ending injury and the Chiefs ended up going 6-11.\n\nThat lack of success hasn't made teams any less interested in the team's assistants, though. Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo have both received head coach interest from teams in this cycle.\n\nNagy, in particular, appears likely to land a new gig. If the coach leaves, the Chiefs will have to find a new offensive coordinator for the first time since 2023.\n\nRecently, Mahomes was asked about Nagy and the quarterback gave a glowing review.\n\n\"I love Coach Nagy... He gave me a lot of ideas to be better as a person and as a quarterback... Wishing him the best throughout this head-coaching process,\" Mahomes said on Thursday.\n\nIf one of the best quarterbacks of all time likes you as a coach, you're probably doing something right. Mahomes played under Nagy in 2017 during the coach's first tenure in Kansas City, so there's plenty of familiarity between the two.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024 under Nagy, the Chiefs' offense was in the top half of the league in both points scored and total yards. The unit took a step back in 2025, finishing 20th in yards and 21st in points.\n\nHowever, the team as a whole regressed, and the offense dealt with some very bad quarterback play after Mahomes went down. Before the injury, Mahomes threw for 3,587 yards with 22 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.\n\nNagy is now looking for his second chance as a head coach. The first time around, Nagy coached the Chicago Bears from 2018-21 and compiled a 34-31 record. The longtime coach has been with the Chiefs since being fired by the Bears.\n\nSo far, Nagy has been reported to have interviewed with the Tennessee Titans, Baltimore Ravens, Las Vegas Raiders, and Arizona Cardinals for their head coaching vacancies. Notably, Nagy is familiar with Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi, as the two were together with the Chiefs.\n\nMike McDaniel could be headed to the AFC North\n\nRobert Griffin III roasts Browns after disastrous season\n\nDid the Dolphins fire McDaniel because of Harbaugh?\n\nFalcons listed as top landing spot for elite head coach\n\nAre the Cardinals the worst HC job in the NFL?\n\nPete Carroll could be replaced by elite college coach",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans interviewed Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator and former Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo for their open head coach position.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans conducted an interview with Steve Spagnuolo for their head coaching vacancy. Here's everything you need to know about the Titans' coaching candidate.\n\nSpagnuolo, 66, has been the Kansas City Chiefs’ defensive coordinator since 2019 and is a four-time Super Bowl champion as a coordinator. He previously served as head coach of the St. Louis Rams from 2009-11 and spent four games as interim head coach with the New York Giants in 2017. Across those four seasons, Spagnuolo posted an 11-41 record. Among coaches who’ve coached at least 50 games in the Super Bowl era, Spagnuolo’s winning percentage is the second worst, ahead of only Hue Jackson.\n\nSpagnuolo has worked with Chiefs coach Andy Reid during Reid’s tenures in Philadelphia and Kansas City. He also worked with Tom Coughlin in New York as the Giants’ defensive coordinator in 2007-08, helping the Giants to a Super Bowl win, before heading to St. Louis for his first head coaching job.\n\nSpagnuolo’s tenure in St. Louis was one of the more disastrous runs for any franchise in recent memory. The Rams went 1-15 in Spagnuolo’s first season, earning the No. 1 pick in the ensuing No. 1 draft that was used on quarterback Sam Bradford. Bradford helped turn things around for the Rams as a rookie, posting a 7-9 record. But the Rams’ fates cratered the next year. Bradford and the offense only scored 193 points all season, the fifth-worst mark of the 21st century and, to this day, the last time an NFL team scored fewer than 200 points across a full season. Spagnuolo’s defense didn’t fare all that much better, allowing the seventh-most points in the NFL and putting up a putrid performance against the run to push the squad to a 2-14 finish and Spagnuolo to his firing.\n\nSpagnuolo bounced around roles with New Orleans, Baltimore and the Giants over the next half-decade before returning to Reid’s orbit at the start of the Chiefs’ dynasty. Under Spagnuolo’s tutelage, Chiefs defenders like Chris Jones, Tyrann Mathieu and Trent McDuffie have earned first-team All-Pro nods, while contributors such as Nick Bolton, Frank Clark and Justin Reid playing at or around the peaks of their positions at various times.\n\nThough Reid’s offense gets a lot of credit for the Chiefs’ Super Bowl wins, Spagnuolo’s defense has been the propulsive force of their last couple of runs. This was especially true in 2023 when the Chiefs owned the NFL’s No. 2 scoring defense and total defense versus ranking No. 9 in total offense and No. 15 in scoring offense.\n\nSpagnuolo worked in Kansas City with Titans GM Mike Borgonzi from 2019-2024, lending some familiarity to the interview process.\n\nThe Titans fired former coach Brian Callahan in October after a 1-5 start to the 2025 season that followed a 3-14 debut year in 2024. Under interim coach Mike McCoy, the Titans finished the 2025 season with another 3-14 record and earned the No. 4 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Titans have announced completed head coach interviews with the following candidates:\n\nKevin Stefanski, former Browns HC\n\nJason Garrett, former Cowboys HC\n\nThe Titans have also scheduled interviews with or requested interviews from the following candidates: Former Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, former Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh.\n\nNick Suss is the Titans beat writer for The Tennessean.

    "fullText": "The 2025 season for Kansas City Chiefs offensive lineman Kingsley Suamataia was a period of significant growth amid uncertainty.\n\n“He (Kingsley Suamataia) did a great job, arrow up—still ways to go, which is normal. The kid went from being a tackle to a guard.” said offensive coordinator Matt Nagy in a recent press conference, “There’s the part of you think of a guy like Joe Thuney and at that position (and) at the guard position, Trey Smith, these guys know the communication side of it, of what they’re doing with that part that sometimes never gets talked about, that communication side.”\n\nSuamataia started all 17 games at left guard in 2025, serving as one of the few consistent and available players during the season.\n\n“The physical side is what we all see on TV and what we all see on film, but what about the mental side of the mistakes or the things that you’re doing well that you can see,” said Nagy, “That’s where I think he has really grown there. The confidence is there, and he needs to just keep that going. The kid has the ability to be really special, and that’s just a credit to (General Manager Brett) Veach and (Head) Coach (Andy) Reid for bringing a guy like that in here.”\n\nThe former BYU standout finished with the most pass block snaps played at guard, according to Pro Football Focus. He will be a stabilizing force on the starting offensive line for a Chiefs team hoping for efficiency and availability heading into next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs OL Kingsley Suamataia displayed growth in sophomore season",

    "fullText": "SPRINGFIELD–For the first time since 2014, the Kansas City Chiefs are not in the NFL playoffs, and it’s a weird feeling down here, in Arrowhead South.\n\nSince the fall of 2015, the Chiefs had won 10 consecutive AFC West Division titles, and competed in the postseason each year. The height of KC’s playoff prowess came between 2019-2024, when the team reached the Super Bowl five times and won three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nHowever, the annual magic Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid are known for cooking up never materialized in 2025. Mahomes suffered a season-ending injury, a torn ACL, with three games left in the season, and watched as KC finished a disappointing 6-11, which was good enough to be second-to-last in the AFC West Division.\n\nSo, without their beloved team in the postseason for the first time, in more than a decade, how did Chiefs fans feel? Were they relieved? Upset? Indifferent? To find out the answers, I went to the Chiefs Mecca of the Ozarks, Coyotes Adobe Cafe. A.K.A. Arrowhead South.\n\nSure enough, I quickly ran into two fans — Deante Johnson and Jack Murphy. Both guys were about college age and shared their thoughts on having no dog in the fight in the playoffs.\n\n“Every year can’t be a winning year, so, we just gotta sit this one out and hope next year’s better,” said Deante Johnson. “Definitely a speed bump, it’s definitely not over. I mean, if we still have Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid, we’ll be fine.”\n\nMurphy echoed Johnson’s comments.\n\n“Last year was definitely heartbreaking,” said Jack Murphy. “Especially kinda getting pretty ran over in that super bowl, wasn’t fun, but as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid I mean, we can get right back there.”\n\nGlass-half-full kinda guys. The kind of fans you want to hear from. However, did they even care about the playoffs if the Chiefs weren’t in it? Or were they rooting for another team?\n\n“It’s been interesting,” Johnson said. “The NFL has definitely had a lot of unexpected teams come out, like Chicago…so it’s been fun to watch.”\n\nMurphy concurred and even admitted he’d like to see a team from the NFC take home the Super Bowl crown.\n\n“The Seahawks, for sure,” Murphy said. “I think it’s a really great story. I really like their head coach, and JSN (Jaxon Smith-Njigba) is a monster.”\n\nAs for Coyotes management, they too were disappointed Kansas City’s streak came to an unexpected end, but they still drew a good crowd for Sunday’s AFC wildcard game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n“For a decade that’s all we knew, but this year is a little different,” General Manager Jared Presley said. “We actually have other fans coming in this year and today we actually filled up with a bunch of Bills fans and a bunch of Jaguars, so it’s kind of a change, it’s good to see, but at the same time we’re kinda heart broken the Chiefs aren’t here.”\n\nOverall, the fanbase is still a little sore they don’t get to see if their favorite team vie for a chance to claim its fifth Super Bowl title, but, as Deante & Jack stated, “as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid, I mean, we can get right back there.”",

That's going to be on me, finally becoming a pro and then having to do that on my own, so I'm excited for that as well.\"\n\nBassa was selected in the fifth round with the 156th pick in this year's NFL Draft, developing into a versatile signal-caller and occasional secondary option while learning under key veterans. Bassa revealed the most eye-opening experience he had in 2025.\n\n\"I wouldn't say unexpected, but when it comes to surprises, I would have to say the time management (and) being on your own. When it comes to time off the field, I feel like I really did a good job of sorting that out, too. There's time where you can spend time for your wellbeing and on your own, like hanging out with your family or doing whatever you need to do, right?\" said Bassa, \"And then there are also times where you need to take care of your body outside of the facility as well. Where there's days you're off, if you play on a Thursday game you're off for a couple of days. I think it would really have to be the time management piece when it comes to that. Just treating it like I always have and taking that process one day at a time.\"\n\nBassa was named Honorable Mention All-Big Ten Conference with the Oregon Ducks in his last season. He played prominently on special teams as a rookie with the Chiefs, but could see more time on defense next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs LB Jeffrey Bassa reflects on lessons from his rookie season",

It was a move that became inevitable when head coach Dan Quinn stripped Whitt of defensive play-calling duties ahead of Week 11.\n\nThe Commanders hired a new offensive coordinator on Friday, promoting assistant quarterbacks coach David Blough. Don't expect Washington to promote an internal candidate for defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Commanders have interviewed three known candidates thus far. One of those candidates drew the attention of one of the NFL's top defensive stars.\n\nOne of the three known interviews is Chiefs' defensive line coach Joe Cullen. Considered one of the league's top defensive line coaches, Cullen has been with the Chiefs since 2022.

He's been an NFL assistant since 2006, working with multiple teams as the defensive line coach. He's been an NFL coordinator once before, albeit briefly. During Urban Meyer's forgettable NFL career, Cullen served as his defensive coordinator in 2021.\n\nThe Commanders have the No. 7 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and badly need a pass rusher.

    "fullText": "A thrilling AFC Divisional Round game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills at the end of the 2021-2022 NFL season led the league to change the overtime rules for playoff games, giving both teams a chance to possess the football. Previously, the team that won the coin toss could elect to receive the kick, and would win the game with a touchdown on their first drive.\n\nThe outcry after Josh Allen and the Bills lost that playoff game without getting a chance to touch the football in overtime led to the revised rules.\n\nSo as the 2025-2026 NFL Playoffs get ready to begin, let’s revisit those rules, because you never know when you will need to know them.\n\nAll playoff games that advance to overtime will follow these revised rules:\n\nIf a game is tied at the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nBoth teams will have an opportunity to possess the football. This is the big change. Previously, as we saw in the 2022 AFC Divisional Round game between Kansas City and Buffalo, if the team that started with the football scored a touchdown, the game was over. Under the new rules, in that scenario, Buffalo would get a chance to match with a touchdown of their own, and if they did, the game would continue. Once both teams have had possession, the game then becomes sudden death. In addition, if the team that starts with possession scores and kicks the extra point to take a seven-point lead, the second team can win with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession is still in progress — the teams will play another overtime period. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nIf the game remains tied after two overtime periods, there will be a second half. The captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be a third coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII made a little history under the revised playoff rules.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII became the first playoff game under the league’s new overtime rules for the postseason, and those changes guaranteed each team a chance to possess the football in overtime. After the San Francisco 49ers kicked a field goal — more on that in a moment — Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs drove down the field and scored the game-winning touchdown on the final play of Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nThat made Super Bowl LVIII the first Super Bowl to see a lead change on the final play of the game.\n\nLooking back at how that unfolded, many wonder if the 49ers should have approached things differently.\n\nSan Francisco won the coin toss, and made the decision to receive the kickoff, despite a prevailing theory that under the new rules it made more sense to defer. With both teams guaranteed a possession, knowing what you need to score to win the game offers a competitive advantage, similar to how teams in college want to start on defense in overtime, so they know what they need to do on offense to win.\n\nInstead, the 49ers began on offense, and could only manage a field goal. That opened the door for the Chiefs to win the game on their guaranteed possession with a touchdown, which is exactly what they did.\n\nSpeaking after the game, San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan stated that the team had run through the various scenarios, and thought by starting on offense they would have the advantage if the game advanced to a third overtime possession, and sudden death.\n\n“None of us have a ton of experience with it,” Shanahan said. “We went through all the analytics and talked to those guys. We decided it would be better getting the ball because if both teams matched and scored, we wanted to be the ones to have a chance to go win it.”\n\nThe problem? The game never got to that third overtime.\n\nLast year, none of the playoff games advanced to overtime, so fans were not treated to another situation like Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nNor did they get a chance to see what, if anything, teams and coaches learned from how that game ended.\n\nAhead of the 2025 NFL season, the league decided to align the overtime rules for the regular season with the approach for the playoffs. However, that change was made “subject to a 10-minute overtime period in the regular season.”\n\nMeaning regular season games could still end in ties, unlike postseason games.\n\nLessons learned from Super Bowl LVIII seemed to come into play during overtime periods in the regular season. One example comes from when the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys went to overtime back in September. Green Bay won the coin toss ahead of overtime but elected to kick, since they were now guaranteed a possession even if Dallas scored a touchdown.\n\nGreen Bay held Dallas to a field goal, giving the Packers a chance to win the game with a touchdown. But when their drive stalled deep in Cowboys’ territory, Green Bay was forced to settle for a game-tying field goal.\n\nOther example from this past regular season indicate that teams will defer in overtime under the new rules. In October the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams went to overtime, with Los Angeles winning the coin toss. Sean McVay and the Rams chose to kick, giving the 49ers possession first.\n\nSan Francisco settled for a field goal, but the Rams were stopped on 4th-and-1 to end the game.\n\nIn November the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons went to overtime, with Carolina winning the toss. Quarterback Bryce Young declared “we want to kick that way,” which was incorrectly granted by the referee. A team can choose to kick, or which end zone to defend, but they cannot choose both.\n\nBut the Panthers indeed started on defense, forced a punt, and then kicked a game-winning field goal on the next drive.\n\nOne scenario that has not been tested yet? The impact of the two-point conversion. After Super Bowl LVIII Kansas City indicated that if necessary, they would have gone for two at the end of their possession to try and win, rather than kick an extra point and extend the game to a third overtime possession.\n\nShould overtime arise in this year’s playoffs, will the two-point conversion come into play?\n\nI guess we will have to wait to find out.",

The double-digit loss season was likely leading to changes in personnel on the field and on the coaching staff.\n\nAccording to NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport, the Chiefs are not retaining wide receivers coach Connor Embree.

The miscues, notably receiver drops in the passing game, didn't help his position on the team.\n\nThe #Chiefs are moving on from WRs coach Connor Embree, source said.

Several moments in close games this season were affected by the team's inability to execute efficiently.\n\nThe first coaching domino has fallen as offensive coordinator Matt Nagy is conducting multiple head-coaching interviews around the league.

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs will have an excellent opportunity to revamp their roster during the 2026 NFL Draft, starting with the No. 9 pick in the Annual Selection Meeting's first round.\n\nIt has been nearly a decade since Kansas City has picked in the top-10, and with plenty of needs to fill in the coming offseason, Chiefs general manager Brett Veach will need to be judicious with his selections to get his team back into the playoffs.\n\nTake a look at this seven-round mock draft, which projects that Kansas City's front office will target offensive skill positions before addressing its defensive needs:\n\nThe Chiefs waste no time finding an exciting playmaker to help Patrick Mahomes. Tate will be one of the first pass-catchers off the board, and could be exactly the kind of dynamic route-runner that Kansas City needs to reinvent its air attack.\n\nJohnson would immediately be able to take over as the Chiefs' leading rusher to bring some 'juice' to the ground game that Kansas City has sorely missed in the past few seasons.\n\nThis might not be the most exciting pick, but Orange — nicknamed 'Big Citrus' — is exactly the kind of run-stuffer that the Chiefs need in the middle of their defensive line.\n\nKansas City selected Nohl Williams out of Cal last year, and takes Masses here in the fourth round to add another former Golden Bear ball-hawk on Day 3.\n\nGiven that the Chiefs ended the season with their third-string quarterback under center, it seems logical that Kansas City might decide to invest a pick at the position this year. Allar was once considered one of the most exciting quarterback prospects in college football, and joins the Chiefs in Round 5 to become Patrick Mahomes' long-term understudy.\n\nAfter addressing wide receiver and running back early, Kansas City targets Gyllenborg to round out its selections of offensive skill position players.\n\nTapp tallied 12 tackles for loss and 7.5 sacks in 2025 and joins the Chiefs as a developmental prospect who could potentially help bolster the edges of Kansas City's defensive line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL Draft: Chiefs take WR, RB early in this seven round mock",

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs could upgrade their wide receiver room by selecting Georgia State Panthers star Ted Hurst in the 2026 NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs used significant draft picks on wide receivers in recent years but need to invest in the position during the 2026 NFL draft. With Marquise Brown, Travis Kelce, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton all entering free agency, the team desperately needs another quality pass catcher capable of elevating the offense.\n\nGeorgia State Panthers wide receiver Ted Hurst is a more well-rounded receiver than Thornton and more explosive than Smith-Schuster. His 6’3”, 195 lbs. frame also separates him from existing members of the Chiefs wide receiver room. Hurst projects as a top 100 selection who should grow into a contributor by the mid-point of his rookie season.\n\nHurst explodes off the line of scrimmage and displays the agile footwork to work across the faces of cornerbacks during his release. He lacks elite speed but uses his initial burst to overtake and stack cornerbacks. While Hurst’s speed isn’t special, he succeeded in stretching the field and generating chunk gains with his long strides at Georgia State.\n\nGeorgia State WR Ted Hurst is my #1 offensive prospect from the G5. \n\n- 6’3/195 \n- goal line fade machine\n- crisp route runner with sudden deceleration\n- elusive after the catch (17 mtkl forced this year)\n- burst to stack press-man\n- good not great top gear\n- cuts routes off vs.… pic.twitter.com/LvUgymsCJO\n\n— James Foster (@NoFlagsFilm) November 15, 2025\n\nDespite being a taller receiver, Hurst sinks his hips well at the top of the route stem and executes effective cuts and route fakes. His route definition occasionally suffers on digs, but he generates natural separation on curls and comebacks.\n\nHurst regularly finds open space against zone coverage and runs his routes to precise depths to move the chains. His work against press coverage needs to improve. The Georgia native is lean and lacks the play strength to power through jams at the line of scrimmage. This makes it easier for cornerbacks to re-route him and impact the timing of the offense’s plays.\n\nHurst caught 61.1% of his contested targets over the past two years. He isn’t a bully at the catch point but tracks the ball well and makes great adjustments to secure receptions through contact. Hurst drops easier receptions due to lapses of concentration, but he dials in for contested opportunities.\n\nHurst lacks the mass and power to break tackles after the catch, but his long strides and agility make him a threat to find open space and gash defenses. He uses jump cuts and his springy footwork to evade defenders while probing for room to run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL draft scouting report: Georgia State Panthers WR Ted Hurst",

He wasn’t going to let his career end that way, and he was motivated that night to return to play with the only franchise he’s ever known.\n\nAfter the Raiders' loss, however, he was much more split. He explained that he doesn’t know at the moment when he will decide what he will do for the rest of the year regarding football.\n\nOne of the most successful players on and off the field, Kelce is scheduled to marry his partner, world pop star Taylor Swift, this coming June in Rhode Island.\n\nHe also hosts one of the most popular podcasts in North America, “New Heights” with his brother, retired NFL lineman and fellow Super Bowl champion Jason Kelce.\n\nEven Travis’ mother, Donna, is set to make her big television debut in only a few days on “The Traitors,” a competitive reality show produced by NBC on Peacock.\n\nWe will keep you updated on Kelce’s decision on whether he will play his 14th season in the NFL or if Sunday was his last dance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Did Travis Kelce Retire From NFL, Chiefs After Week 18 Loss?",

    "description": "Take a look at our staff predictions for the Kansas City Chiefs' Week 18 matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs will take the field for the final time this season when they face the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium this afternoon.\n\n2025 was a difficult year for the Chiefs. After losing in Super Bowl LIX, Kansas City attempted to retool its roster in the offseason. But despite their best efforts, the Chiefs found themselves eliminated from playoff contention after a midseason collapse.\n\nNow 6-10, Kansas City will have a chance to end its disastrous 2025 campaign on a high note against a bitter rival.\n\nCheck out our staff predictions for the Chiefs' Week 18 matchup against the Raiders:\n\nThe 2025 season officially comes to an end in Week 18 as the Kansas City Chiefs attempt to get back in the win column.\n\nThe offense will primarily focus on Travis Kelce, who could be playing in his final NFL game. Chris Oladokun will produce better results after a full week of practice, as he hopes to raise his stock for next season. The Chiefs' running backs will be closely watched as Dameon Pierce is expected to make his team debut.\n\nThe defense should continue to play well as young players gain experience. The unit has performed well during the late-season losing streak. Every rep is necessary to build for the offseason into the 2026 campaign.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 13, Raiders 10\n\nKansas City will finally finish its rollercoaster season on Sunday before a long and much-needed offseason break.\n\nFrankly, there's no way to tell how Sunday's game will play out. The Chiefs are down to backups and third-stringers as head coach Andy Reid looks to avoid injuries ahead of the offseason. Quarterback Chris Oladokun was serviceable in last week's loss to the Denver Broncos, but with several offensive stars on Kansas City's injury report in Week 18, a high-scoring game is likely out of the question. Still, expect a big game from tight end Travis Kelce as he potentially takes the field for the final time.\n\nQuarterback Bo Nix tore the Chiefs' defense apart in Week 17, when he threw for 182 yards and a touchdown. It is still unknown who the Raiders will have under center on Sunday, though it will likely be backup quarterback Kenny Pickett. Pickett may not be as threatening as Nix, but the former Pittsburgh Steeler is still good for the occasional legacy game. With no real incentives on the line, Kansas City's defense will most likely fail to stop the veteran backup.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 21, Raiders 23\n\nKansas City has every incentive to lose this game. Draft position is all that matters at this point, and while a meaningless win would make the Chiefs' disastrous 2025 campaign look a little better on paper, a 6-11 record could help Kansas City maximize the trappings of its failure in April.\n\nDown to their third-string quarterback, the Chiefs would almost certainly be considered underdogs against any other opponent. Only the lowly Raiders could make this Kansas City team look competent.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 12, Raiders 8\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs vs. Raiders: 3 predictions for AFC West showdown in Week 18",

    "fullText": "Chiefs free agent predicted to take $40 million deal from AFC foe originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have a lot of decisions to make this offseason. After a poor season that will end with them missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014, coaching and philosophy changes are at the top of the wish list for many fans, as is an offensive weapon or two. That said, there will be departures that Kansas City will have to replace - one of which very well could be pending free agent Jaylen Watson.\n\nWatson has been a tremendous success story for the Chiefs, making the roster as a rookie seventh-round pick in 2022 and working his way to becoming a starter. That said, Kristopher Knox of Bleacher Report predicts that the Tennessee Titans will sign Watson to a three-year, $40 million deal.\n\n\"In 15 starts this season, Watson allowed an opposing passer rating of only 79.0 in coverage,\" Knox writes. \"Watson should draw strong interest on the open market, even if he isn't the most notable cornerback available—Riq Woolen, Greg Newsome II, and Alontae Taylor are arguably bigger names. Don't be surprised if the Tennessee Titans make a strong push to land him.\"\n\n\"The Titans need an influx of talent and are projected to have the third-most cap space in the league in 2026. They could also use corner help to bolster a defense ranked 29th in net yards per pass attempt allowed. Tennessee also employs general manager Mike Borgonzi, who joined the Titans after 16 seasons with Kansas City.\"\n\nThe Chiefs will likely look very different on both sides of the ball in 2026, and losing Watson would certainly be a big reason for that.\n\nChiefs predicted to sign star NFC running back to $29 million deal\n\nDolphins seek help from ESPN broadcaster in general manager search\n\nGiants reportedly targeting former Coach of the Year as their next head coach\n\nBlockbuster trade proposal sends $106 million star to Buffalo Bills\n\nBears projected to steal AFC running back with $34 million contract",

Do everything we can to win,\" said Nagy, \"As an offense, our part of it is making sure that we understand that this part of the season, going into the final game, it's been a while since we've been in this territory, mentally as you go through the week of the prep stuff and then different players in different positions playing, that sort of thing. So, no matter who it is, the one common denominator is we have the same schedule throughout the week, with the practices, the same mindset for us of going in and trying to do everything we can to play well and win.\"\n\nThe Chiefs' offense has struggled with consistency and big plays all season, even when Patrick Mahomes was healthy. Nagy believes in the team's future as he tries to piece together what went wrong in 2025.\n\n\"Big picture offensively for us is I think all of us understanding that the season didn't go as we wanted to in the end. There were parts of the year in the middle of the season where we felt like – and I think I brought this up to you before, we really felt like we were at a peak level offensively,\" said Nagy, \"Unfortunately, it didn't last all the way through the year. Now here we are at the end of the year playing in this game that is important to us to finish strong, and it's our job to do that, to coach strong players to play strong, and then in the end, win. I think the last several games didn't go how we wanted, but we want to finish on a high note.\"\n\nKansas City's lone touchdown in Week 17 was led by quarterback Chris Oladokun, who completed 13-of-22 passes for 66 yards and a touchdown.

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Now that the Kansas City Chiefs have committed to building a new stadium and team headquarters in Kansas, what’s next for the Truman Sports Complex?\n\nWhile the Royals could still renew their lease with Jackson County, county legislator Manny Abarca says it’s time to start thinking about the future of the land.\n\n“At the end of 2031, December 1, something will change and we want to be ready for that with a plan, with a strategy, if we’ve got to tear down one or two stadiums, we should be prepared for that, not waiting for after the fact,” Abarca said.\n\nAbarca wrote a letter to Jackson County Executive Phil LeVota on Wednesday, with a plan to use the existing Repair, Maintenance, Management, and Operations (RMMO) fund to set aside money for the potential demolition of one or both stadiums and the redevelopment of the land.\n\n“We’ve got to have a strategic plan going forward,” Abarca said.\n\n“That opportunity of us, scrapping some of that maintenance and repair money towards the strategic plan is still within our RMMO accounts. So, there’s some opportunity. We just have to be willing to do it.”\n\nCurrently, a 3/8 cent sales tax sends roughly $55 million annually to the complex’s upkeep and renovations. Saving half of that money over the course of the next 5 years could amount to north of $137 million.\n\nAs for what’s next for the land, Abarca says it could be of huge benefit for the county.\n\n“I think we can look at that as a county park, as a county asset. There were houses there before and so I think there’s an opportunity to look at that as a public housing option if there aren’t stadiums there. It’s adjacent to our Rock Island corridor, which is currently a bike route, but could be a mass transit route. There’s a lot of opportunity, right? Its geographic location is really center of our county.”\n\nWhether the Royals decide to stay at Truman or leave, Abarca says it’s time to be prepared for the next phase of that land.\n\n“Before taxpayers were asked to fund stadiums, this was a green space. These were neighborhoods. These were communities. There’s vibrancy that was there before. Now, instead of walking away with an abandoned stadium, that can be 30 to 50 to $70 million to tear down and maybe two of those, it can at least be a green space.”",

    "fullText": "The conversations about whether or not Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce will catch another pass from Patrick Mahomes have dominated his retirement rumors. Kelce's in-depth conversation with team legend Tony Gonzalez aired on Prime Sports before last Thursday's Christmas game and addressed multiple topics, including Mahomes.\n\nThe conversation was filmed at Kelce and Patrick Mahomes' 1587 Prime restaurant, with the 11-time Pro Bowler opening up about his friendship with the two-time league MVP.\n\n\"He's (Patrick Mahomes) family now. I think through all the hard work and all the family time that we've had outside the facility and outside the building, there'll definitely never be a goodbye to him, It'll just be like another day in the life with Patty Mahomes.\" said Kelce, \"What he's been to my career up to this point, you can't measure it. It's all the little things that you see manifest out there onto the field that we're working on every single week, every single offseason. When he came into the league, he took this thing by storm. It's been a fun ride ever since he's been at the helm.\"\n\nSince Mahomes became the starting quarterback in 2018, the duo has been inseparable on the field. Their production and chemistry are unmatched, but their future remains murky heading into the offseason, especially after Kelce was asked that question during a recent press conference.\n\n\"That was a harsh reality when I got asked that. I was like, 'Oh man, that's a dark way to look at it.' I think, I don't know, I'll always be able to go out there in the backyard slinging around with the old Texas gunslinger,\" said Kelce, \"But you know that day is going to come. If it's already happened, I can feel pretty content with how many times he's connected on the field with me and how much success and how much fun we've had playing this game.\"\n\nMahomes was in attendance during the Chiefs' Christmas night home finale against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs TE Travis Kelce opens up about friendship with Patrick Mahomes",

Well, the Texans took care of business today and defeated the Chargers, which has clinched the AFC West for the Denver Broncos.\n\nAFC WEST CHAMPS.\n\nGoal No. 1 ✅\n\nAnd we’re still climbing. pic.twitter.com/yHbSmyw8Ww\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 28, 2025\n\nThis is the Broncos’ 16th AFC West Championship, their first since 2015, and the first for Head Coach Sean Payton and quarterback Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos have been on a magical run this season, and after starting the season 1-2, they ripped off 11 straight wins and are now AFC West champions and the favorites for the number one seed in the AFC. They have been led by their elite defense and second-year quarterback Bo Nix, who has improved as the season went on and has led multiple 4th quarter comebacks and game-winning drives.\n\nWith a postseason berth and now the AFC West locked up, the Broncos will set their sights on the number one seed in the AFC. They can clinch the one seed as early as tomorrow, but they will need a lot of help for that to happen. They will need the Patriots to lose to the Jets, the Bills to lose to the Eagles, and the Jaguars to lose to Grandpa Phillip Rivers and the Colts. All three of those scenarios playing out tomorrow are highly unlikely, so the Broncos will likely need to win next weekend, at Mile High, vs. the Chargers.\n\nThe Broncos are back where they belong. Three years ago, the team fired Nathaniel Hackett the day after Christmas and just signed quarterback Russell Wilson to a contract that would age poorly. Now, three years later. Sean Payton has led the Broncos back to being Super Bowl contenders, and Bo Nix is your franchise quarterback.\n\nTIME TO CELEBRATE BRONCOS COUNTRY, THE DENVER BRONCOS ARE YOUR 2025 AFC WEST CHAMPIONS!",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. — The Kansas City Chiefs are coming to Kansas City, Kansas as state leaders and team leadership announced the plan Monday.\n\nKansas is issuing Sales Tax and Revenue or STAR Bonds to pay for more than half of the $3 billion project. The state issues STAR Bonds to private investors and pays them back with new tax revenue.\n\nJohnson County officials, fans celebrate Chiefs stadium move\n\nRepublican State Senate President Ty Masterson said one of his requirements for approving the stadium deal as the Chair of the Legislative Coordinating Council (LCC) was that it wouldn’t lead to higher taxes. Masterson talked to FOX4 on Tuesday while he was in Andover, just a day after he was in Topeka for the big announcement.\n\n“Nobody. Worst case scenario, nobody buys the bonds, the bonds don’t get sold, the project doesn’t happen,” Masterson said when asked who’s on the hook if there isn’t the private interest in the buying of these bonds.\n\n“Not at all, I’m excited,” he said when asked if that concerned him at all that that’s a possibility.\n\n“I think there’s going to be general excitement. I think they’re even going to get a good rate for their bonds.”\n\nFOX4 took that comment to Washburn Political Science Professor Bob Beatty in Topeka. He says the nearly $2 billion in STAR Bonds that will be issued is a bit of an experience with the Chiefs stadium going up somewhere near I-70 and I-435 in Wyandotte County.\n\n“That being said, there’s an adage that basically goes around where you don’t bet against the NFL, Beatty said.\n\n“It has become a global phenomenon, and from the salaries, and the costs of stadiums and the amount of money that’s generated, and yes, even now the cache of Taylor Swift and celebrities, it’s not necessarily always a rational economic decision.”\n\nKC mayor vows to compete like hell’ in renewed border war after Chiefs announce move to Kansas\n\nTwo and a half hours after the Beatty interview, Kansas Department of Commerce Marketing and Communications Director Patrick Lowry sent FOX4 a statement.\n\n“The excitement surrounding bringing the Chiefs to Kansas and the new economic opportunities the stadium, facilities, and mixed-use developments will create, are sound reasons to be confident in the success of this project,” Lowry said.\n\nThe STAR Bond District appears to cover all of KCK, not to mention Western Johnson County.\n\n“I would say that with all humility, bringing the National Football League to Wyandotte and building the facility that we’re going to build is going to drive development,” Chiefs President Mark Donovan said Monday in relation to a question about the STAR Bond District.",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce addressed retirement speculation following the Kansas City Chiefs' Christmas night defeat to the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos won 20-13 over the Chiefs Thursday night at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Kelce, who played alongside third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun while starter Patrick Mahomes and backup Gardner Minshew were out with knee injuries, had five catches for 36 yards against the Broncos.\n\nTaylor Swift reads aloud a love letter from Travis Kelce in new docuseries: What it says\n\nThe Chiefs' loss comes amid talks about whether Kelce will announce if he is retiring or not after the season. He sparked rumors about a possible retirement in a pre-game interview with former NFL star Tony Gonzalez on Prime Video.\n\nIn the interview, Kelce said he feels motivated about his future but that he \"has to make the right decision for me.\"\n\n\"I got to hope that if I do want to come back, the Chiefs are willing to bring me back, so it's a two-way street on that,\" he said. \"But at the same time, at this point in this year, I'm just trying to finish out and give Chiefs Kingdom everything I got and go out there and do it with some of that flair.\"\n\nHe added that his brother, Jason Kelce, who retired from the NFL in 2024 after 13 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, is one of several people he's spoken to about the question of retirement.\n\n\"I'm asking myself, what was it for you that helped you find that answer?\" Kelce said.\n\nGonzalez, who retired from the NFL in 2013, replied with his reasons leading up to his retirement and told Kelce that he is \"one of the greatest tight ends of all time.\n\n\"You have won Super Bowl rings, you have been all pro, you have done stuff off the field, you have stuff waiting for you after the season's over -- the sky's the limit on what your next chapter is going to be,\" he said.\n\nIn a post-game press conference shared by KMBC-TV on YouTube, Kelce reflected on Thursday's game and said there were \"a whole lot of emotions.\"\n\n\"You've got everybody in the world watching you,\" he said. \"You get to go out there with the young guys on prime-time television. Young guys getting an opportunity to taste what this NFL life is like.\"\n\nWhen asked what was going through his head in what could have been his last game at Arrowhead stadium he talked about the fans that have supported him and the Chiefs.\n\n\"You only get a few of those moments where you just get to stand there and appreciate 60- to 70,000 Chiefs fans screaming for you.\"\n\nTaylor Swift wears engagement ring while cheering on Travis Kelce's college team\n\n\"I always embrace that moment, it's fun and hopefully I got everybody fired up for it,\" he added.\n\nIn terms of retirement, he said, \"I'll let that be a decision I'll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes.\"\n\nKelce's teammate Chris Jones, defensive tackle for the Chiefs, said in a separate post-game interview shared on YouTube by KMBC-TV that he hopes Thursday's game wasn't his last with Kelce.\n\n\"We just have been through so much together,\" he said. \"He's been like a brother. I hope he gives it one more year. Just one more, man. Just one more.\"\n\nESPN said that Kelce's fiancé Taylor Swift was in a stadium suite cheering him on. His teammates Mahomes and Minshew were also there to show their support.",

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos once again played down to their competition against a Kansas City Chiefs team forced to play its third-string quarterback, but the Broncos somehow managed to overcome their struggles to win, 20-13 in a problematic game that once agains exposed their limitations.\n\nThis game was defined by four long Denver drives, one in each quarter. The first two came up short to produce a pair of Wil Lutz field goals, with gave the Chiefs a chance to hang around and counter with a touchdown on a short drive after a Bo Nix interception to make the score 7-6 at halftime.\n\nThe Chiefs actually scored first in the third quarter after a pass interference penalty on Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II gave KC the ball in Denver territory, which led to a 53-yard field goal by Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker that made it 10-6.\n\nThe Broncos proceeded to drive the field again, and this time Nix was able to finish by running the ball in from nine yards out for Denver’s first touchdown of the night. That gave the Broncos the lead, 13-10, but the Chiefs were able to counter with yet another Butker field goal from 47 yards after a 44-yard punt return by running back Brashard Smith.\n\nDenver’s final drive of the game was the fourth one to last for at least 14 plays, and Nix finished the 65-yard effort with a one-yard touchdown pass to running back RJ Harvey. The key play in the drive was a defensive offside penalty by Chiefs tackle Chris Jones that gave Denver a critical red-zone first down that led to the score.,\n\nThe Broncos were lucky to win this one, and Kansas City’s last-ditch scoring attempt featured some receiving heroics from Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. But a final pass to receiver Hollywood Brown in the end zone in the final seconds ended up bing an overthrow that allowed Denver to survive.\n\nNix was decidedly mediocre, producing just 182 yards passing as he went 26-for-38, and his longest throw of the night went for just 10 yards. The Broncos also struggled to run the ball effectively for most of the night, and it was this combination that allowed the Chiefs to stay within striking distance.\n\nThe Denver defense did what it had to do against third-string Chiefs quarterback Chris Oladokun, but there were some scary moments when bad tackling in the secondary once again nearly cost them. Oladokun passed for just 66 yards on the night as he went 13-for-22, but the fact that the Chiefs were in this one at all was mostly a testimony to the Broncos’ ongoing struggles.\n\nThe win gave Denver the pole position in the race for the top seed in the AFC, but it’s hard to imagine the Broncos making a deep playoff run given their lack of a running game and Nix’s ongoing issues with inconsistency. There’s a lot to fix before their final game against the Los Angeles Chargers, and that game will be for the AFC West title if the Chargers can defeat the Houston Texans on Saturday.\n\nThe Chiefs played valiantly given their offensive limitations and the fact that this game was meaningless for them, and they’ll wrap up their broken season with a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders that promises to feature some ugly football given where both teams are right now.",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce walked off the field at Arrowhead Stadium with a smile Thursday night, seemingly in good spirits. While we still don’t know if that was it for him at the stadium in Kansas City, and the 20-13 loss to the Denver Broncos wasn’t the best way to go out, Kelce still got plenty of love from Chiefs fans on his way out the door.\n\nKelce’s mom, Donna, and his fiancée, Taylor Swift, were in attendance, too. The walk back to the locker room this time felt different.\n\nTravis Kelce walks off the field after his last home game of the season 🫶 @tkelce | @chiefs pic.twitter.com/5keiEj8Hvu\n\n“You only get a few of those where you just get to stand there and appreciate 60-70,000 Chiefs fans screaming for you,” Kelce said in his postgame news conference. “I always embrace that moment, man. It’s fun. Hopefully I got everybody fired up for it.”\n\nKelce has spent his entire career with the Chiefs, who selected him in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft out of Cincinnati. He quickly became a fan favorite and played an integral part of the Chiefs’ dynastic run and their three Super Bowl wins. His public relationship with Swift has only skyrocketed his fame over the past several years.\n\nThe 11-time Pro Bowler is closing in on 13,000 career receiving yards and has 82 touchdowns on 1,077 catches over his 13 seasons in the league. All three of those figures are the most in franchise history. He had five catches for 36 yards Thursday night.\n\nBut at 36, Kelce is undoubtedly nearing the end of his career. There has been plenty of speculation that he may retire at the end of the season, especially considering the Chiefs are going to miss the playoffs for the first time since Kelce’s second season in the league. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes is recovering from an ACL and LCL injury he suffered earlier this month, making the start of next season unclear.\n\nIf Kelce were to retire after this season, which would mark the end of an era for the franchise that has dominated the league in recent years, Thursday’s game would be his final one at home. He's at the end of a two-year, $34.25 million deal with the team and would become a free agent in the coming months.\n\nKelce declined to give much clarity on the speculation postgame.\n\n“Honestly, I’ve been just focused on trying to win football games, man,” Kelce said about retirement. “I’ll let that be a decision that I make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes.”\n\nThe Chiefs will take on the Las Vegas Raiders next weekend to wrap up their season. Based on Kelce’s comments Thursday night, we won’t have an answer on his future until after that.\n\nBut if this was the end, considering the circumstances, Kelce sure took advantage of his final moments at Arrowhead.",

Kelce was eventually double-teamed, though, and a final pass to receiver Hollywood Brown in the end zone wound up being an overthrow tight as Denver survived.\n\nThe Broncos will move on to play the Los Angeles Chargers for the AFC West title next week, assuming the Chargers can beat the Houston Texans on Saturday.

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — If Thursday night was the last game Travis Kelce played inside Arrowhead Stadium, he sure tried to make it a memorable one.\n\nThe Chiefs tight end only had five catches for 36 yards against Denver, playing alongside third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun while his good buddy Patrick Mahomes and backup Gardner Minshew were out with knee injuries. But several of those catches came in the closing minutes, nearly rallying Kansas City in what would have been a stunning upset of the Broncos.\n\nKelce and Co. wound up losing 20-13 in a game in which they were nearly two-touchdown underdogs.\n\nBut it was a gutsy display by him in a career filled with them.\n\nThe four-time All-Pro, who is expected to announce soon after the season whether he is retiring, could have hung up the cleats a couple of weeks ago, when the reigning AFC champions were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in a decade.\n\nInstead, after going to five Super Bowls — including the last three — and winning three championship rings, the 36-year-old Kelce showed that he had too much pride to quit on a lost season. He played in a humiliating loss to lowly Tennessee last week, and he was one of the few bright spots Thursday night for an offense that finished with 139 yards in all.\n\n“A whole lot of emotions,” Kelce said afterward. “You've got everybody in the world watching you. You get to go out there with the young guys on primetime television. Young guys getting an opportunity to taste what this NFL life is like.”\n\n“I’ll let that be a decision I’ll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes,” Kelce said.\n\nHe was the final player introduced Thursday night, following Oladokun out of the tunnel in the corner of Arrowhead Stadium. As red lights flashed across the field, Kelce emerged from the fog with his signature bow-and-arrow entrance gesture toward a festive holiday crowd, and it predictably roared in delight — perhaps for the last time — as No. 87 took the field.\n\n“You only get a few of those (moments) where you get to stand there and appreciate 60, 70-thousand Chiefs fans cheering for you,” Kelce said. “I always embrace that moment.”\n\nIn a suite high above, his fiancee, pop star Taylor Swift, watched him perform. So did Mahomes and Minshew, who took in the game together from a suite; Mahomes tore ligaments in his knee two weeks ago, Minshew did the same last week.\n\n“You feel the generations of happiness and the love that (the fans) have,” Kelce said. \"It’s a beautiful thing, man. It’s something I know I’ll cherish forever, whether it’s coming out of the tunnel or just making a big play for them. That’s why we love Arrowhead.”\n\nKelce has played 97 games inside the stadium over the course of a 13-year career. He caught 645 passes there, including playoffs, the third-most by any player inside a single stadium behind Jerry Rice and Larry Fitzgerald since the AFL-NFL merger.\n\nNow, the question is whether Kelce will play next week in the Chiefs' season finale in Las Vegas.\n\nHe needs just 10 yards receiving to reach 13,000 for his career, and he could extend his franchise record — and the longest active streak in the NFL — by catching a pass in his 191st game next weekend. He could also go out with a win, rather than having lost five straight and seven of his last eight games, which is the slide the Chiefs find themselves on now.\n\nOr, maybe he will surprise everyone and come back for one more year.\n\n“We've been through so much together,” Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones said, making his desire clear. \"Just one more (season). Just one more.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

The move to the IR means he will be out at least four weeks, which would take the Broncos though the AFC title game.\n\nTheir first order of business is winning the AFC West. They can do it this weekend with a win over the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium and by getting some help from Houston with a victory over the Chargers in Los Angeles on Saturday.\n\nWattenberg, a fifth-round pick in the 2022 draft out of Washington, has been solid in the middle for the Broncos all season. And last month, the team rewarded the 28-year-old offensive lineman with a four-year, $48 million contract extension.\n\nAlex Forsyth was starting in his place against Kansas City. He played four games when Wattenberg was injured last season.\n\nThe Broncos also promoted tight end Marcedes Lewis and offensive lineman Calvin Throckmorton, promoted linebacker Levelle Bailey and wide receiver Michael Bandy, and waived running back Cody Schrader amid a flurry of roster moves Thursday.\n\nThe 41-year-old Lewis was signed in late October and has appeared in four games for Denver. He's providing some depth at tight end while Nate Adkins continues to deal with a lingering knee injury.\n\nBailey is providing depth with linebacker Dre Greenlaw out with a hamstring injury, and Bandy is doing the same at wide receiver, where the Broncos are missing rookie Pat Bryant in the concussion protocol.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "The Broncos face the Chiefs in Kansas City on Christmas. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "When the NFL schedule makers sat down to craft the Christmas slate of games, they likely envisioned the clash between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs as a battle for the AFC West title.\n\nWhile the Chiefs have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Broncos can wrap up their first AFC West title since 2015 with a win tonight, and a little bit of help from the Houston Texans on Saturday. In addition, Denver can also secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but they will need a little more help here in Week 17 to clinch the top seed.\n\nLet’s start with the AFC West title. Denver can clinch the division title this week, officially bringing to an end the Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nIn addition, Denver can also wrap up the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week, and the lone bye week in the AFC playoffs.\n\nBut they would need a lot of help to get that done.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWith the Chiefs already eliminated from the playoffs, this game will not have any tiebreaker implications for the Chiefs and Broncos directly.\n\nBut it could play a role for the Broncos when it comes to seeding, in a very narrow scenario.\n\nLooking at the AFC West, the Broncos lead the division with a 12-3 record, while the Chargers are in second place with an 11-4 record. If Denver beats the Chiefs and the Chargers beat the Texans on Saturday, the two teams will meet in Week 18 with the division title up for grabs.\n\nWhy? Because the Chargers against Denver earlier this season, and another win in Week 18 in this scenario, would see the two teams finish at 13-4. The first tiebreaker in a division is head-to-head record, which woudl give the Chargers the AFC West title.\n\nThen the Broncos would be seeded somewhere from No. 5 to No. 7, depending on how the Bills finish, who could also end the year with a 13-4 record. If, again in this scenario, the Bills finish with the same 13-4 record as Denver, the tiebreaker will be conference record. Right now, Buffalo is at 8-3, and they have one AFC game remaining so they would finish at 9-3 in this scenario.\n\nDenver right now has a 7-3 record in AFC games, and would finish at 8-4 in this scenario, dropping them behind the Bills.\n\nAgain, this is a very specific hypothetical, but this game could matter in a tiebreaker scenario.",

Let's meet the Chiefs' starting quarterback replacing Mahomes and Minshew.\n\nOladokun played six seasons of college football from 2016 to 2021, including three at South Florida, two at Samford, and one at South Dakota State. Though he received eight starts with Samford in 2019, his lone season as a full-time starter came in 2021, his final year in college, with South Dakota State.\n\nDuring the 2021 campaign with the Jackrabbits, Oladokun tossed 25 touchdowns to just seven interceptions, leading South Dakota State to an 11-4 record.\n\nAfter a successful season with the Jackrabbits, Oladokun headed to the NFL, where he was a seventh-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was released by Pittsburgh during final cuts and found a home in Kansas City afterwards.\n\nOladokun has been with the Chiefs since, winning two Super Bowls on the practice squad. He made his first NFL appearance against the Broncos in 2024, but his true debut came in Week 16 of the 2025 campaign versus the Titans.\n\nIn Tennessee last week, Oladokun completed 11 of 16 passes for 116 yards in Kansas City's blowout loss. The 28-year-old will now get his first career start in Week 17 against the Broncos at Arrowhead.\n\nLamar Jackson Rumor puts Ravens QB in play for Raiders in 2026\n\nT.J.

    "fullText": "Chiefs vs. Broncos live score, updates, highlights from 2025 NFL Christmas game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Broncos\n\nThe NFL on Christmas Day delivers an AFC West rivalry matchup unlike any seen in the last decade, as the Denver Broncos (12-3) travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs (6-9) at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nIn a stunning reversal of roles, the Broncos enter as the dominant force, aiming to secure the AFC West title and remain firmly in the driver's seat for the conference's crucial No. 1 overall seed and the coveted first-round bye. With the Los Angeles Chargers breathing down their necks, a victory over the crippled Chiefs would officially clinch the AFC West for Denver, ending Kansas City's unprecedented nine-year reign as division champions and marking this holiday game as perhaps the most significant in Denver's last ten years.\n\nFor the three-time defending AFC Champion Chiefs, this prime-time holiday slot is a bittersweet stage for an unfamiliar role. Having already been officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era, the Chiefs have seen their season completely unravel, suffering a losing record for the first time since 2012. The franchise is currently battling devastating injuries, with Mahomes and his backup Gardner Minshew both sidelined by ACL injuries, leaving the offense to be managed by third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun. The team that was once the gatekeeper of the AFC has become a hollow shell of its dynasty self.\n\nThe stark contrast in stakes presents a unique challenge to the streaking Broncos, who must overcome a late-season loss to the Jaguars that snapped their 11-game winning streak. Head Coach Sean Payton is stressing focus, emphasizing that despite the Chiefs' struggles, a division title and the No. 1 seed are still their stated goals. A win in Kansas City, where the Broncos have historically struggled, would not only solidify their resurgence but would also serve as the ceremonial passing of the torch, ushering in a new era of dominance in the AFC West.\n\nThis Christmas night contest marks a seismic shift in the AFC power structure. What was once the annual, late-season coronation of the Chiefs is now the potential crowning moment for the Broncos — a team ready to reclaim the top spot in the AFC West and send a clear message to the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Chiefs vs. Broncos on Christmas.

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos will take the field for an epic AFC West showdown at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas Day.\n\nWith just two weeks remaining in the regular season, Kansas City has found itself eliminated from playoff contention and set to play for nothing but pride in front of a home crowd.\n\nDenver is vying to win the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs and is considered the favorite to win today's holiday showdown.\n\nTake a look at our staff predictions to get a better idea of how the Week 17 contest between Kansas City and the Broncos might play out:\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs will play the spoiler role on Christmas night against the Denver Broncos. The disappointing season can end on a relatively high note in the home regular-season finale for a fanbase that needs something extra to cheer about during the holidays.\n\nChris Oladokun will make his first career NFL start on a national stage with all to gain in this division tilt. The running game will be in the spotlight, as the third-string quarterback shouldn't be relied on to throw for 300+ yards in his first start against a ferocious defense. Harrison Butker should be utilized often, depending on the efficiency of the drives.\n\nThe Chiefs' defense will be motivated to pressure Bo Nix often to give themselves a chance to win. The turnover battle needs to be in their favor, and they need to rely on the energy from the Arrowhead Stadium crowd.\n\nFinal score: Broncos 24, Chiefs 14\n\nWith two games left to play this season, Kansas City's sixteen-week-long nightmare is almost over.\n\nThe primary focus of Thursday's matchup will be the effort of the Chiefs' backups. A victory, though not entirely out of the question, is unlikely given the state of Kansas City's roster. Major performances from second- and third-string players could help answer some of the many questions the Chiefs have going into the offseason.\n\nOne key player to watch on Thursday will be superstar tight end Travis Kelce, who very well may be playing his final game at Arrowhead. The four-time All-Pro will be quarterback Chris Oladokun's primary target as he looks to finish off his thirteenth season as Kansas City's top receiver. Expect Kelce to have a solid outing on Thursday, though it will not be enough to secure a win.\n\nFinal score: Broncos 28, Chiefs 13\n\nKansas City will almost certainly lose this game. If they don't, it should be considered a Christmas miracle. Expect Denver to take an early lead and pull its starters when the game is in hand. It may be best for younger Chiefs fans to avert their eyes.\n\nAt least we have the draft to look forward to.\n\nFinal score: Broncos 33, Chiefs 3\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 3 predictions for Chiefs' Christmas Day showdown vs. Broncos",

    "description": "STAR bonds are like a credit card: We buy the gifts now, but then we pay for them for the next 20 years. | Opinion",
    "fullText": "Merry Christmas, Kansans — or should I say the Whos in Whoville?\n\nWe are finally getting a major professional sports team. To quote my baby sister, “We got just what we wanted, but there was that one thing.” Isn’t there always just that one more thing that we want? In this case, we all know that’s the Royals — but it doesn’t stop there. We need to talk seriously about overuse of the state’s STAR bonds.\n\nYes, I am feeling particularly Grinchy this year.\n\nTo be fair, STAR bonds have served good purposes in Kansas for almost 30 years. The building of the Legends and the Kansas Speedway shave been good things for Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, which was once a food desert. Other communities throughout the state such as Dodge City, Hutchinson, Wichita and many others have benefited from STAR bonds by enhancing the cultural and entertainment appeal of their communities.\n\nHowever, this Professor Grinch is beginning to believe that STAR bonds are becoming a problem. This one is a blowout year on the old STAR bond credit card — because we buy the gifts now, but then we pay for them for the next 20 years. All the Whos will insist that they are not really raising taxes with the STAR bonds, but that isn’t really true. The state and its municipalities are giving up all the additional revenue that would have naturally compounded anyway.\n\nIn the case of the Chiefs, the proposed stadium and entertainment district spans two counties and eight municipalities by my count. The big dollars, though, will come from the state of Kansas, which has a sales tax rate of 6.5%, compared with the 1.25% in my little corner of Douglas County. So, Kansas will be paying off the stadium project with lower sales tax yields for the next 20 years from the already fastest-growing part of the state.\n\nThe Whos might also point out that like all STAR bonds, those offered to the Chiefs are designed to increase sales tax revenue, and so they would just capture that expansion. Professor Grinch would point out that inflation is nearly constant, which means that the sales tax yields would increase naturally anyway.\n\nAnd this was already set to be a blowout year on STAR bonds, with projects in Wichita, Lawrence, Bonner Springs and others. At least three former STAR bond projects have failed, including the Schlitterbahn water park, Heartland Park in Topeka and the Museum at Prairiefire. It is hard to see where this ends, but when communities can put the state on the hook for new amenities, they and their developer partners are not going to ask for the STAR bond program to go away.\n\nThe question that needs to be asked is whether projects such as sports arenas and amusement parks are things that the state needs, and whether all the Whos in Kansas are willing to pay for them.\n\nProfessor Grinch’s heart is likely two sizes too small, but he would really like for someone to go steal that STAR bond credit card, cut it up into a million pieces and throw it in the trash.\n\nZach Mohr is an associate professor of public budgeting and finance at the University of Kansas, and even his kids think he is a Grinch.",

    "fullText": "Chris Oladokun’s friend, Jake, texted last Saturday night to say he was making the drive from Asheville, North Carolina, to Nashville, where the Chiefs were facing the Tennessee Titans the next day. It would be cool, Jake told him, to see his friend in a Chiefs uniform as the team’s understudy at quarterback.\n\nBut as Jake entered Nissan Stadium and looked up at the video board, he got an eyeful. There was No. 19 for the Chiefs on the field.\n\n“And he’s like, ‘Is Chris in the game?’” Oladokun said.\n\nYes, he was. A knee injury to starter Gardner Minshew, who was subbing for the injured Patrick Mahomes, meant the first serious playing time in his NFL career for the former Sickles and Alonso High School standout.\n\nOladokun has played in numerous preseason games for the Chiefs since joining the team in 2022 and in last season’s regular-season finale at Denver Oladokun logged five mop-up snaps in his NFL debut.\n\nThis was different. Oladokun was the man on the spot. It didn’t end in victory, with the Chiefs absorbing a 26-9 loss. But Oladokun received encouraging feedback and personally felt good about his 31-snap appearance. He completed 11 of 16 passes for 111 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.\n\n“There’s always something to clean up,” said Oladokun, who played his first three college seasons at USF before finishing at South Dakota State and being a seventh-round draft pick by the Steelers in 2022.\n\nOladokun said every offensive possession started with teammates providing reassurance, especially guard Trey Smith.\n\n“Every single drive,” Oladokun said. “Trey would look back at me, and he’s like, ‘I’ve got your back.’ It speaks to his character and the whole offense that they rallied behind me like that.”\n\nOffensive coordinator Matt Nagy said he knew Oladokun was ready soon after entering the game early in the second quarter. The Chiefs had called a play with jet motion, where a slot receiver is moving at full speed across the formation before the snap. But the timing was off.\n\n“What (Oladokun) did was stop him, he stopped the motion, let him get set and got the back in the right spot and made a simple play,” Nagy said. “That speaks to his calm and where he was early in the game.”",

    "description": "Here’s how we think the Denver Broncos will do vs the Kansas City Chiefs during Week 17 action in the NFL.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos will look to turn the page quickly on their tough loss a few days ago with a road win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. The Chiefs are down to their third string quarterback and have nothing left to play for. This is a game the Broncos should win and if they don’t, then the real questions begin.\n\nWe’re pretty confident that this won’t be the case. The Broncos should coast to victory like they did against Kansas City in the final game of last season when they were resting starters instead of being long-eliminated from contention.\n\nDenver Broncos at Kansas City ChiefsP.M. Mile High time\nGEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri\nATS Betting Lines: Denver -13.5\nMoneyline Odds: Denver -1200 / Kansas City +750\nOver/Under: 36.5\nNote: All odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nCollectively, our Mile High Report staff is predicting a Broncos 27-11 win on the road over the Chiefs. Here’s how each of us predicted things would go individually:\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe line in this game is crazy…. if only because the over/under stands at 36.5. They expect the Chiefs offense to sputter and the Broncos offense to be ho-hum. I checked the weather and that isn’t going to be a factor at all it appears. Given all that, I’ll be cheeky here and predict a backdoor cover and an under. Now I just wait for the officiating crew to make it happen! – Tim Lynch\n\nThis one isn’t difficult. The Broncos should beat the Chiefs. It shouldn’t be close. The defense will be looking to make a statement, which should mean bad things for a 3rd string QB. Bo Nix will want some redemption from the loss to Jacksonville. – Adam Malnati\n\nAfter an incredible 11-game winning streak, the Broncos finally suffered their first loss since Week 3 of the regular season. On Christmas, they will play the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Even though the Chiefs will be playing their third-string quarterback, Denver can’t underestimate their division rival. The Broncos have to play a complete game, limit the miscues and mistakes, and find a way to win. Their hopes of an AFC West title and #1 seed depend on it. Ultimately, I believe the Broncos can bounce back to get their thirteenth win of the season. – Chris Hart\n\nNix and the Broncos should win this game. As others have noted, KC is down to their third-string QB and have been eliminated from the AFC Playoffs. But crazy things happen in December at Arrowhead. So Denver can’t look passed this game or just lollygag and expect to get the win. Approach this game like a must-win game, which it is, and put the poor showing against the Jags behind everyone. Take nothing for granted, play a complete game, and make Chiefs Kingdom’s Christmas a little less enjoyable. – Ian St. Clair",

    "fullText": "This week, Chiefs Wire's Ed Easton Jr. spoke with retired All-Pro offensive lineman and CBS Sports analyst Kyle Long.\n\nIn his interview with Easton Jr., Long discussed his role as a remote analyst for NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix on Thursday, December 25th, and his thoughts on Travis Kelce potentially retiring after Patrick Mahomes' devastating knee injury.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Emmy and Grammy Award–winning superstar Kelly Clarkson will welcome fans with a performance of her holiday hit, \"Underneath the Tree.\" Snoop's Holiday Halftime Party features special guest Lainey Wilson and stars from KPOP Demon Hunters.\n\nNFL CHRISTMAS GAMEDAY\nLIVE on Netflix December 25\n-- \nCowboys vs. Commanders @ 1 PM ET\nLions vs. Vikings @ 4:30 PM ET\n\n— Netflix Sports (@netflixsports) December 18, 2025\n\nMahomes' Week 15 season-ending injury requiring surgery to repair his ACL and LCL won't likely have him back immediately for the start of the 2026 season. Long shared his thoughts on this, which could affect Kelce's future playing.\n\n\"Well, there was a book I read when I was younger. It's called 'Where the Red Fern Grows'. It was about, I don't really know what it was about, but there were two dogs in it, and they were so dang close,\" said Long, \"They did everything together, they hunted together, they ate together, they slept together. And once, one of the dogs got hurt on a barbed-wire fence. The dog didn't make it. It's one of the saddest stories I've ever read, and then the other dog couldn't eat anymore. It was sad.\"\n\nMahomes and Kelce have been one of the league's greatest duos since the 2018 season. The prospect of them returning to form with a healthy Mahomes is a sight many Chiefs fans would love to see after a disappointing 2025 season.\n\n\"Is that what happens in Kansas City,\" said Long, \"or are we going to see Travis Kelce, like he did this past offseason, train his butt off, come in the best shape of his life, be a top-five producing tight end in football, and wait for his homeboy (Patrick Mahomes) to show back up at quarterback? They can take some names and kick some butts, because people are taking their shots on the Kansas City Chiefs right now.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kyle Long on Travis Kelce's future after Patrick Mahomes' injury",

I thought he got better, and he was trying his all to be out there with his team. Similar to Xavier (Worthy), he’s trying to take that leadership role and lead all the young guys.”\n\nRice was out with an injury in Week 16 against the Tennessee Titans and currently has collected 53 receptions for 571 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs WR Coach Connor Embree on dropped passes, Rashee Rice’s season",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) – Being a Kansas City Chiefs fan is often about loyalty and emotional commitment. But with the Chiefs announcing Monday that they would leave the historic Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri and move into a not-yet-built $3 billion stadium on the Kansas side of Kansas City, Kansas-based fans soon won’t need to root for their team across state lines.\n\n“That creates energy that I don’t think we really understand or really appreciate until it starts happening, until the stadium gets built, they play their first game, they play their first season,” Kevin Jenks, the president and CEO of the Wichita Sports Commission, said.\n\nThe Chiefs spent more than five decades playing at Arrowhead. They intend to build their new stadium in Wyandotte County, in the same area as Kansas Speedway and the Legends retail district.\n\n‘I just love Arrowhead’: Some Chiefs super fans not sold on move to Kansas\n\nEven though Wichita will be a few hours away from the new field, the hope is that the team’s presence can strengthen the area’s sports identity. Wichita Sports Commission hopes that includes strengthening ongoing partnerships with the franchise.\n\n“The Chiefs have been big proponents of getting flag football into high schools, and we were a part of that locally with some Wichita schools,” Jenks said. “We are still continuing to promote and be a part of that process.”\n\nDr. Larry Straub, an associate professor of business management at Newman University, says the Chiefs’ presence is likely to improve Kansas’ national image. However, he’s skeptical that the financial boom that comes with a major sports team moving in will echo around the state.\n\n“From an economics standpoint, I think the closer you are to Kansas City, the more benefits you’re going to have,” Straub said.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

With the league's practice requirement met, Denver's alternate helmet is now prepped for a special Christmas Day showdown with a division rival.\n\nThe Broncos will complete an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and white socks. That would contrast nicely to a potential all-red look from the Chiefs.\n\nA winter White Out coming on Christmas Day 🥶 pic.twitter.com/Tdv7vmQFDK\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 23, 2025\n\nNFL teams are allowed to wear alternate/throwback uniforms up to four times per season. Denver previously wore its alternate blue jersey on Monday Night Football against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 4, and its throwback look against the Dallas Cowboys (Week 8) and Raiders (Week 10). The Broncos will wear the beautiful throwback uniform again against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 18 (Jan. 3/4).\n\nDenver unveiled a new uniform wardrobe last year, and the NFL relaxed its rules this offseason, allowing teams to wear alternate helmets with non-alterate jerseys, which is why Denver can wear its alternate helmet with its standard road jersey.\n\nBroncos fans can also look forward to the team's upcoming \"Rivalries\" series uniform, which is set to arrive in 2027.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL news: Broncos announce uniform for Christmas game vs. Chiefs",

Long will be on the remote team, alongside host Scott Hanson.

I look at the defense, which is really the unsung hero in this dynasty,\" said Long, \"That is the Kansas City Chiefs' historically strong ability to get teams off the field on third down. You know, you know, when the defenders hold up their fists, and they're like, We did it. We did it. We didn't see a lot of fists in the air this year for the Kansas City Chiefs.\"\n\nLong played his final NFL season in 2021 with the Chiefs, alongside many teammates who remain with the franchise today. Kansas City struggled in close games throughout the season, tallying few takeaways and sacks.\n\n\"Not only that, their sack numbers were down, and their ability to get after opposing quarterbacks has been a trademark. The fan club for Chris Jones is called 'Sack Nation'. Well, they've been out to lunch all year, and it's not just Chris Jones,\" said Long, \"He's getting triple-teamed, double-teamed. That guy's an incredible player. They don't have enough juice on defense to stay in games the way they did last year. When somebody went out offensively, the defense would make a big play. They cover each other. That's complimentary football.

    "fullText": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas lawmakers are poised to vote Monday on a proposal that could lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line from Missouri, and replace popular but aging Arrowhead Stadium with a new facility capable of hosting major year-round events.\n\nThe meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council, which includes the state's top lawmakers, is expected to be attended by Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and other team officials. If the proposal is passed, the Chiefs could move swiftly in announcing plans to depart their 53-year-old home at the Truman Sports Complex for a stadium that could cost upwards of $2 billion.\n\nThe state's proposal would allow for STAR bonds to be issued to cover up to 70% of the overall cost of the project. They would be paid off with state sales and liquor tax revenues generated in a defined area around around the sports complex.\n\nThe same bonding process was used to build Kansas Speedway and the surrounding shopping and entertainment district, known as The Legends, in Kansas City, Kansas — the area where a future stadium for the Chiefs is most likely to be built.\n\nThe area is also home to Children's Mercy Park, where Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer plays its home matches.\n\n“The state of Kansas is in active discussions with the Kansas City Chiefs about the prospects of building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas,” the Kansas Department of Commerce said last week. “No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come. We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”\n\nThe move by the Chiefs would be a massive blow to Missouri lawmakers and Gov. Mike Kehoe, who have been working on a package of their own to prevent a second NFL franchise in a decade from leaving their borders. The Rams departed St. Louis for Los Angeles a decade ago in part because of their inability to secure funding to help replace The Dome at America’s Center.\n\nKehoe backed a special legislative session in June to authorize bonds covering up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50 million of tax credits for each stadium and unspecified aid from local governments.\n\nThe special session came in response to Kansas lawmakers approving their bond package.\n\nThe Chiefs originally planned an $800 million renovation of Arrowhead Stadium in a joint effort with the Kansas City Royals, who are similarly planning to build a new facility to replace Kauffman Stadium — which sits a couple of hundred yards across a parking lot from Arrowhead Stadium — when the two teams' leases with Jackson County, Missouri, expire in January 2031.\n\nBut after county voters soundly defeated a local sales tax extension last year, the Royals and Chiefs began work on separate plans.\n\nThe Royals will not be discussed by Kansas lawmakers Monday, but momentum appears to be building behind their own move across the state line. An affiliate of the club already has purchased the mortgage on a tract of land in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nQuinton Lucas, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, has been working to keep both franchises on the Missouri side of the state line. He said in a statement over the weekend that negotiations had continued with the Chiefs throughout last week.\n\n“We’ll reserve further comment until we hear from the Kansas City Chiefs,” Lucas said.\n\nHunt has long said his preference was to renovate Arrowhead Stadium, which was beloved by his father and team founder, the late Lamar Hunt. It is considered one of the jewels of the NFL, alongside Lambeau Field in Green Bay, and is revered for its tailgating scene and home-field advantage; it currently holds the Guinness World Record for the loudest stadium roar.\n\nThis summer, Arrowhead Stadium will host six World Cup matches, including matches in the Round of 32 and quarterfinals.\n\nThe Hunt family has warmed in recent years to the idea of leaving their own mark by building its replacement, though. Not only would a new, state-of-the-art stadium provide new revenue streams, through luxury seating and accompanying development, but a fixed or retractable roof would allow it to be used year-round. That would mean the potential to host concerts and events, college football bowl games, the Final Four and one of Lamar Hunt's long-held dreams: a Super Bowl.\n\nHanna reported from Topeka. Skretta reported from Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Things went from bad to worse for the Kansas City Chiefs at the quarterback position on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nThe Chiefs had already taken a major blow as they lost starting quarterback and multi-time Super Bowl Champion Patrick Mahomes last week to a torn ACL in a loss to the Chargers that eliminated the team from playoff contention for the first time in over a decade. But just when Chiefs fans thought the tough times couldn't get much tougher, that is exactly what happened as backup quarterback Gardner Minshew left the game against the Titans due to injury.\n\nThe real kicker? Early reports indicate that Minshew also tore his ACL, becoming the second quarterback for the Chiefs to do so in two weeks – and forcing Kansas City into a position where they will have to finish their last two games without their top two quarterbacks.\n\nChiefs are concerned that QB Gardner Minshew tore his ACL, as @mattderrick also reported. There will be additional tests but Minshew could be the second Chiefs’ quarterback in two games to tear his ACL. pic.twitter.com/vDVoxOTGKb\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 21, 2025\n\nTo add insult to (literal) injury, the Chiefs would end up losing the game to the Titans 26-9, handing Tennessee just their third win of the season in the process. Kansas City dropped to 6-9 overall with the loss, further worsening an already disappointing season for the Chiefs which still features an upcoming game with the AFC West leader and potential top AFC playoff seed the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Chiefs will now turn to third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, who starred in college at South Florida, Samford, and South Dakota State before being drafted in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Steelers before eventually landing in Kansas City.\n\nHe entered Sunday's loss to the Chiefs following the injury to Minshew, and completed his first career pass on a touchdown to Travis Kelce. He would finish the game 11-of-16 with 111 passing yards and two carries for seven yards, but it was not enough to help the Chiefs to victory.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Brutal QB luck continues for Chiefs with Gardner Minshew injury",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is recalling nearly 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial and other senior embassy posts as it moves to reshape the U.S. diplomatic posture abroad with personnel deemed fully supportive of President Donald Trump’s “America First” priorities.\n\nThe chiefs of mission in at least 29 countries were informed last week that their tenures would end in January, according to two State Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel moves.\n\nAll of them had taken up their posts in the Biden administration but had survived an initial purge in the early months of Trump’s second term that targeted mainly political appointees. That changed on Wednesday when they began to receive notices from officials in Washington about their imminent departures.\n\nAmbassadors serve at the pleasure of the president although they typically remain at their posts for three to four years. Those affected by the shake-up are not losing their foreign service jobs but will be returning to Washington for other assignments should they wish to take them, the officials said.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on specific numbers or ambassadors affected, but defended the changes, calling them “a standard process in any administration.” It noted that an ambassador is “a personal representative of the president and it is the president’s right to ensure that he has individuals in these countries who advance the America First agenda.”\n\nAfrica is the continent most affected by the removals, with ambassadors from 13 countries being removed: Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSecond is Asia, with ambassadorial changes coming to six countries: Fiji, Laos, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam affected.\n\nFour countries in Europe (Armenia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Slovakia) are affected; as are two each in the Middle East (Algeria and Egypt); South and Central Asia (Nepal and Sri Lanka); and the Western Hemisphere (Guatemala and Suriname).\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the ambassadorial recalls, which have drawn concern from some lawmakers and the union representing American diplomats.",

    "fullText": "Star pass-rusher Chris Jones was listed on all of the Kansas City Chiefs' injury reports this week ahead of the team's matchup against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nWill Jones' injury affect his ability to take the field in today's game?\n\nHere's the latest update on Jones' status:\n\nJones is said to be dealing with a hamstring injury and started the week as a limited participant in the Chiefs' practice sessions on Wednesday and Thursday. He was a full participant in the team's workouts on Friday.\n\nThe Chiefs did not give Jones an official game status designation for Week 16, so he shouldn't need to miss any time due to his hamstring injury.\n\nIf Jones aggravates his hamstring injury and needs to exit today's game, Kansas City will expect veteran linemen Mike Pennel and Jerry Tillery to anchor the middle part of its front-four.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chris Jones injury: Will Chiefs' star DL play vs. Titans in Week 16?",

    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman Ashton Gillotte spoke with reporters on Wednesday, discussing weekly improvement and playing for pride to finish the season.\n\n“I definitely think it’s been a gradual thing, and I think I’m better than where I started the year. It’s obviously just comfortability thing, getting used to the level of play.” said Gillotte, “Everyone’s the top player in this league and you’re going to get the best shot from everyone every week. Just being able to be more comfortable on the field (and) not think as much about plays and stuff, that’s kind of what has helped me, and just continuing to build.”\n\nThe former Louisville standout secured his first NFL interception in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers. Gillotte discussed his personal goals for the final three games, which he can build on as he enters the offseason.\n\n“Just to finish it strong. Obviously, we know the playoff picture isn’t there, but we still have pride to play for, and we still have the name on our back and the colors we represent,” said Gillotte. “We just want to make the people proud going into the last games.”\n\nGillotte has 27 total tackles and 1.5 sacks to go along with his line interception through 14 games this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs DE Ashton Gillotte on weekly improvement, playing for pride",

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs are traveling to Nashville to face the Tennessee Titans in Week 16. The game will be played at noon CST/1:00 p.m. EST on CBS.\n\nThe Chiefs and Titans both come in hobbled, but this game will be crucial for draft positioning.\n\nThe Titans have reasons to be optimistic for a win this week. Here are three of them.\n\nThe Chiefs come into this game majorly banged up and without incentive to win after being eliminated from playoff contention. Their injury list on Thursday read like a grocery list. Rashee Rice, the Chiefs' best wide receiver, will likely miss the game. Chris Jones is managing a hamstring issue, Jawaan Taylor with an elbow issue, and Jaylon Moore with a knee issue. That's two offensive tackles in an already banged-up offensive line. Of course, Patrick Mahomes was also put on the injured reserve. That Mahomes' injury has led the team to put Gardner Minshew in his stead.\n\nMinshew is a familiar quarterback for the Titans' defense. They have played him many times over the years, having had crucial stints as the Jaguars' and Colts' quarterback. Most recently, this team faced him in 2023 when he was manning the Colts. This familiarity with Minshew will help the Titans' game plan, having faced him six times before. This familiarity goes in the Titans' favor.\n\nThe Titans' offensive line has been putting together great performances, making it two weeks in a row now. They allowed zero sacks last week and were creating monstrous holes for Tony Pollard to run into. With the injuries on the Chiefs' defensive line, they have a good shot of building on their previous performances. Confidence is rising that this unit should stick together into next season. What's most crucial for the offensive line now is finishing this season healthy and having a healthy offseason together.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Tennessee Titans vs. Chiefs: 3 reasons for optimism in Week 16",

    "title": "Exclusive: Top lawyer for military joint chiefs told chairman that officers should retire if faced with an unlawful order",
    "description": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?",
    "fullText": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?\n\nRequest to retire — and refrain from resigning in protest, which could be seen as a political act, or picking a fight to get fired.\n\nThat was the previously unreported guidance that Brig. Gen. Eric Widmar, the top lawyer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave to the country’s top general, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, in November, according to sources familiar with the discussion.\n\nCaine had just seen a video that included six Democratic lawmakers publicly urging US troops to disobey illegal orders. He asked Widmar, according to the sources, what the latest guidance was on how to determine whether an order was lawful and how a commander should reply if it is not.\n\nWidmar responded that they should consult with their legal adviser if they’re unsure, the sources said. But ultimately, if they determine that an order is illegal, they should consider requesting retirement.\n\nThe guidance sheds new light on how top military officials are thinking about an issue that has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, as lawmakers and legal experts have repeatedly questioned the legality of the US military’s counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean including intense scrutiny of a “double-tap” strike that deliberately killed survivors on September 2.\n\nCaine is not in the chain of command. But he is closely involved in operations, including those in SOUTHCOM, and is often tasked with presenting military options to the president—more so than Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, CNN has reported.\n\nThe Joint Staff declined to comment for this story.\n\nSeveral senior officers who reportedly expressed concerns about the boat strikes, including former US Southern Command commander Adm. Alvin Holsey and Lt. Gen. Joe McGee, the former director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, have retired early in recent months.\n\nWidmar’s advice to Caine was meant to help inform the chairman’s discussions with senior military officials should the issue come up, the sources said. The Democrats’ video had become headline news, enraging Hegseth and sparking debates across the country.\n\nA separate official familiar with military legal advice said that it is not uncommon for lawyers to urge servicemembers to consider leaving the force if they believe they’re being asked to do something they are personally uncomfortable with, but it’s typically handled on a case-by-case basis and tailored to the facts of the situation.\n\nOther current and former US officials, however, including those who have served as miliary lawyers in the Judge Advocate General corps, stressed that broadly encouraging servicemembers to quietly retire — if they’re eligible — rather than voice dissent in the face of a potentially illegal order risks perpetuating a culture of silence and lack of accountability.\n\n“A commissioned officer has every right to say, ‘this is wrong,’ and shouldn’t be expected to quietly and silently walk away just because they’re given a free pass to do so,” said a former senior defense official who left the Pentagon earlier this year.\n\nMore than a dozen senior officers have either been fired or retired early since Trump took office in January, an unusually high rate of turnover. In a speech before hundreds of general and flag officers in September, Hegseth directed officers to “do the honorable thing and resign” if they didn’t agree with his vision for the department.\n\nBut disagreeing with the direction of the military is different than viewing an order as illegal, legal experts said.\n\nDan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former JAG lawyer, said that the guidance, as described by CNN, appears to “misunderstand what a servicemember is supposed to do in the face of an unlawful order: disobey it if confident that the order is unlawful and attempt to persuade the order-giver to stop or modify it have failed, and report it through the chain of command.”\n\nMaurer added that “if the guidance does not explicitly advise servicemembers that they have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the guidance is not a legitimate statement of professional military ethics and the law.”\n\nWidmar advised that an order may be unlawful if it is “patently illegal,” or something an ordinary person would recognize instinctively as a violation of domestic or international law, the sources said — the My Lai massacre in Vietnam is an oft-used example. But the guidance he provided was that an unlawful order should be met with retirement, if possible, and did not note that servicemembers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the sources said.\n\n“It’s a very safe recommendation in this current political environment,” said the former senior defense official. “But that doesn’t make it the right or ethical one.”\n\nExperts on civil military relations have previously pointed to retirement as a reasonable option for officers who object to a particular policy, while noting that it comes with its own costs.\n\nIn a September article that has been discussed amongst the Joint Staff and other senior military officials, Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University, and Heidi Urben, a former Army intelligence officer and current associate director of Georgetown University’s security studies program, wrote that “quiet quitting”, or opting for retirement “allows officers with professionally grounded objections to leave without posing a direct challenge to civilian control.”\n\nAnd while officers shouldn’t resign in protest or pick fights, they argued, they should “speak up” and “show moral courage” when the military’s professional values and ideals are at risk.\n\nAnd they should be willing to be fired for it. “Complete silence can be corrosive to good order and discipline and signal to the force that the military’s professional values and norms are expendable,” they wrote.\n\nMaurer, the former Army officer, said the advice to retire in the face of an unlawful order also functions to “keep that person silent in perpetuity, because as a retiree he or she remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which criminalizes a broad range of conduct and speech that would be constitutionally protected for regular civilians.”\n\nThose constraints have been apparent as the Pentagon has launched an investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and one of the Democratic lawmakers seen in the video encouraging troops to disobey unlawful orders, which prompted Caine to seek the legal advice.\n\nAs questions continue to swirl around the legality of the boat strike campaign, Widmar also advised Caine that Article II of the Constitution gives the president the authority to authorize lethal force to protect the nation, unless hostilities rise to the level of a full-blown war — in which case Congressional approval is required, the sources said.\n\nWhether the president’s orders are legal to begin with, Widmar advised according to the sources, is a question only the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel can answer, due to the executive order Trump issued in February that says the president and the attorney general’s “opinions on questions of law are controlling” on all executive branch employees — to include US troops.\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel determined in September that it is legal for Trump to order strikes on suspected drug boats because they pose an imminent threat to the United States, CNN has reported.\n\nSince September 2, the US military has killed at least 99 people across dozens of strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, arguing that those targeted were “narcoterrorists” that pose a direct threat to the United States. The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n\nLawmakers have said that Pentagon officials have acknowledged in private briefings not knowing the identities of everyone on board a vessel before striking it; instead, military officials only need to confirm that the individuals are affiliated with a cartel or criminal organization to target them.\n\nSome members of Congress, legal experts and human rights groups have argued that potential drug traffickers are civilians who should not be summarily killed but arrested—something the Coast Guard did routinely, and continues to do in the eastern Pacific, when encountering a suspected drug trafficking vessel.\n\nCNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report",

While it might not be surprising Ohio State's loaded team dominates the pro prospects, 18 of Sporting News' 32 first-round projections in all are tied to CFP action.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead with five such picks, with Georgia, Oregon, Texas A&M, Alabama and Miami also in line to have multiple selections on Day 1. Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas Tech get on the board, too. That's incredible representation from three-fourths of the CFP teams, which also account for all three QBs and four of the first five overall picks.\n\nHere is the Sporting News' latest NFL Mock Draft ahead of the 2025 College Football playoff.\n\nMORE: Bills, 49ers rise as Packers fade in latest SN Power Rankings\n\n(No. 1-18 order courtesy of Tankathon; No. 19-32 from Week 16 playoff picture)\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Giants, if they stay at No. 1 overall and don't trade out of this pick for a team wanting a quarterback, should consider taking Reese as an all-around force to fix a lot of their defensive issues away from a rather productive pass rush.\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (6-5, 225 pounds)\n\nThe Raiders can't be happy with their quarterback situation post-Derek Carr, with Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett screaming that they need to go after a true, strong, accurate franchise passer solution. Mendoza looks the part with his arm and intangibles, two things that should appeal to the influence of Tom Brady.\n\nMORE: How Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman over Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin\n\nRueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-3, 275 pounds)\n\nThe Titans also don't need a QB after taking Cam Ward No. 1 overall last year, but they can go back to the Hurricanes program to get the game-changing pass-rusher they desperately need for their latest defensive reboot.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State (6-2, 200 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to stop messing around at wide receiver and give either Shedeur Sanders or a different starting quarterback a true go-to all over the field, both in the slot and outside, in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jaxon Smith-Njigba vein, only lacking the hyphen.\n\nDante Moore, QB, Oregon (6-3, 206 pounds)\n\nMoore has the leadership and intangibles to handle being the next shot at a franchise QB in New York as well as the savvy and strong arm.

This may seem like a luxury pick for a team that has a lot of needs, but they can get some tackle help later and Love can be a game-changer for restoring balance and expanding the explosiveness.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC (5-11, 195 pounds)\n\nThe Saints, should they stick with Tyler Shough at QB, need to give him more weapons after depleting the receiving crops beyond Chris Olave. Kellen Moore can have some visions of Lemon being the DeVonta Smith to Olave's A.J.

Downs is a terrific do-everything hybrid who would be set up to make a lot of big plays in Dan Quinn's scheme.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson (6-3, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Bengals need to keep beefing up their defensive line to pull out of being atrocious against the run and it doesn't hurt to have some of Woods' inside pass-rush juice to support their end rotation.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee (6-0, 193 pounds)\n\nThe Rams know that cornerback coverage is their biggest weakness on an otherwise loaded roster, with some retooling needed. They keep up the strong defensive pick momentum with the nice-sized, tough McCoy.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT, Miami (6-6, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Dolphins need to get more offensive line help for wherever they go at QB and they can stay in town to get a long-term all-around rock in Mauigoa.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon (6-3, 245 pounds)\n\nThe Chiefs need to be feeling the imminence of Travis Kelce's retirement and can step right into drafting his dynamic go-to receiver replacement to boost Patrick Mahomes again once he returns from his torn ACL.\n\nMORE: Why it's not time to announce the Chiefs dynasty over yet\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Vikings will need to keep working on their secondary with some contract issues ahead and Delane is not that far off in battling McCoy for the status as the best corner in this class.\n\nDavid Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech (6-3, 250 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys will go to work on replacing Micah Parsons' pass rush production with this Lubbock chess piece who has all the moves to get to the quarterback as well as unique dropback coverage ability for the position.\n\nMORE: Full list of stadiums hosting 2025 College Football Playoff games\n\nKeldric Faulk, EDGE, Auburn (6-6, 285 pounds)\n\nThe Ravens should love this complete outside linebacker option who can provide power vs. the run as well as needed pass-rush juice.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Panthers have been feeling the void at linebacker for a while after it was once a strength and GM Dan Morgan should have intrigue to go for his former position with Styles, a versatile talent who makes a lot of plays everywhere along with Reese.\n\nCashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M (6-2, 248 pounds)\n\nHowell can give the Lions the needed strong complementary pass rusher for Aidan Hutchinson to relieve their secondary coverage a lot more next season.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson (5-11, 180 pounds)\n\nThe Jets, after going QB with Moore earlier in this mock, can get their Sauce Gardner replacement with the pick acquired in that trade with Terrell, brother of Falcons star A.J.\n\nMORE: Latest news on QBs entering NCAA transfer portal\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah (6-6, 302 pounds)\n\nThe Texans have gotten surprising returns from rookie Aireontay Ersery and the rest of their rebuilt line but should be in the market to boost pass protection and run blocking at either right tackle or guard with Fano.\n\nT.J.

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce entered the 2025-’26 NFL season looking to win a fourth Super Bowl with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, but it all fell apart in Week 15. In the fourth quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers, Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL. The Chiefs lost 16-13 and were eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nIt was a very disappointing season for Kansas City as the offense never found a consistent rhythm, even with Mahomes and Kelce playing really well. Following the game, the Chiefs’ tight end refused to speak to the media, citing that it wasn’t the right time.\n\nNow, Kelce has broken his silence on Mahomes’ brutal ACL injury, while sending a possible hint on his future with the Chiefs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jason and Travis Kelce released their “New Heights” podcast after Week 15. Many were waiting to hear what the Kansas City tight end was going to say about Mahomes, but they didn’t expect the possible hint about his future.\n\n“[Patrick Mahomes] is a fearless, fearless warrior when it comes to this football thing,” Kelce said. “He’s gonna make sure that he comes back stronger than ever. Hopefully, the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible. I know right now it’s kind of right around that, Week 1 or the beginning of the season next year. I know he’s going to be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs as soon as possible.”\n\nKelce’s decision to say “the Chiefs” instead of “we” has stirred up some discussion on social media that he has already made up his mind about retirement. In the midst of a tough 2025 NFL season, it is not shocking to hear that Kelce might have already made up his mind after coming off a loss in the Super Bowl.\n\nIf so, this means that Kelce has caught his final pass from Mahomes, as Gardner Minshew appears to be the starting quarterback for the rest of the NFL season. Based on Kelce’s comments, it seems like these will be his final three games in the NFL before entering retirement as well.\n\nFranciso Lindor Traded to LA Dodgers, and 4 Other Destinations Following Weird Trump Rumor\n\n‘We’re going no matter what’: Sirens dismiss Olympic rink worries\n\nAlex Bregman Free Agency Rumors Link Him to Surprise NL West Team in 2025",

    "fullText": "Chiefs' doctor shares wildly confusing timeline for Patrick Mahomes' return from torn ACL originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs did the football world a solid on Wednesday. They made their medical director available to talk to the media about Patrick Mahomes after the superstar QB's torn ACL.\n\nThat's Rick Burkholder, the Chiefs' Vice President of Sports Medicine and Performance. And while he provided some concrete thoughts, he also made Mahomes' injury return timeline quite a bit more confusing, at least if you squint.\n\nThis is what The Kansas City Star's Sam McDowell shared on X:\n\n\"Rick Burkholder, Chiefs Vice President of Sports Medicine and Performance, said the ballpark timeline for the Patrick Mahomes type of injury is 9 months, but it could be a month or two less or a month or two longer.\"\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nOK, so that nine-month timeline is what is being thrown around a lot. And the fact that it could take a month or two longer isn't crazy. Players have taken closer to a full year to return from torn ACLs before.\n\nBut wait, \"a month or two less\"?\n\nIf our math is right, that'd get Mahomes back in... seven months, at the earliest? Mid July?\n\nThat seems pretty outlandish based on just about all the evidence of this injury ever, especially considering this is one of the few most important athletes in the entire world of professional sports. The Chiefs probably wouldn't overly rush it.\n\nMORE: Bills may not win the AFC East — but they sent a clear warning to the rest of the NFL\n\nAlso, the Chiefs don't even have a ton of incentive to get Mahomes back in the middle of the summer. Even if he was somehow cleared that fast, Kansas City wouldn't rush their legendary QB to get too much work in too quickly.\n\nRegardless of expectation, this is something that football fans everywhere will be watching closely. Mahomes' health will be a huge NFL storyline the entire offseason. And now we know what the Chiefs' doctor thinks of it.\n\nJaxson Dart has a 50% head injury problem\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a game never before done by an NFL quarterback\n\nA Travis Kelce retirement hint is coming\n\nTua Tagovailoa's contract looks like a nightmare\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury has fans asking Tom Brady ACL question\n\nThis Mike Tomlin horrible streak is hard to believe",
