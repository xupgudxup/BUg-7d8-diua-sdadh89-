    "fullText": "Travis Kelce entered the 2025-’26 NFL season looking to win a fourth Super Bowl with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, but it all fell apart in Week 15. In the fourth quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers, Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL. The Chiefs lost 16-13 and were eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nIt was a very disappointing season for Kansas City as the offense never found a consistent rhythm, even with Mahomes and Kelce playing really well. Following the game, the Chiefs’ tight end refused to speak to the media, citing that it wasn’t the right time.\n\nNow, Kelce has broken his silence on Mahomes’ brutal ACL injury, while sending a possible hint on his future with the Chiefs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jason and Travis Kelce released their “New Heights” podcast after Week 15. Many were waiting to hear what the Kansas City tight end was going to say about Mahomes, but they didn’t expect the possible hint about his future.\n\n“[Patrick Mahomes] is a fearless, fearless warrior when it comes to this football thing,” Kelce said. “He’s gonna make sure that he comes back stronger than ever. Hopefully, the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible. I know right now it’s kind of right around that, Week 1 or the beginning of the season next year. I know he’s going to be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs as soon as possible.”\n\nKelce’s decision to say “the Chiefs” instead of “we” has stirred up some discussion on social media that he has already made up his mind about retirement. In the midst of a tough 2025 NFL season, it is not shocking to hear that Kelce might have already made up his mind after coming off a loss in the Super Bowl.\n\nIf so, this means that Kelce has caught his final pass from Mahomes, as Gardner Minshew appears to be the starting quarterback for the rest of the NFL season. Based on Kelce’s comments, it seems like these will be his final three games in the NFL before entering retirement as well.\n\nFranciso Lindor Traded to LA Dodgers, and 4 Other Destinations Following Weird Trump Rumor\n\n‘We’re going no matter what’: Sirens dismiss Olympic rink worries\n\nAlex Bregman Free Agency Rumors Link Him to Surprise NL West Team in 2025",

    "fullText": "Chiefs' doctor shares wildly confusing timeline for Patrick Mahomes' return from torn ACL originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs did the football world a solid on Wednesday. They made their medical director available to talk to the media about Patrick Mahomes after the superstar QB's torn ACL.\n\nThat's Rick Burkholder, the Chiefs' Vice President of Sports Medicine and Performance. And while he provided some concrete thoughts, he also made Mahomes' injury return timeline quite a bit more confusing, at least if you squint.\n\nThis is what The Kansas City Star's Sam McDowell shared on X:\n\n\"Rick Burkholder, Chiefs Vice President of Sports Medicine and Performance, said the ballpark timeline for the Patrick Mahomes type of injury is 9 months, but it could be a month or two less or a month or two longer.\"\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nOK, so that nine-month timeline is what is being thrown around a lot. And the fact that it could take a month or two longer isn't crazy. Players have taken closer to a full year to return from torn ACLs before.\n\nBut wait, \"a month or two less\"?\n\nIf our math is right, that'd get Mahomes back in... seven months, at the earliest? Mid July?\n\nThat seems pretty outlandish based on just about all the evidence of this injury ever, especially considering this is one of the few most important athletes in the entire world of professional sports. The Chiefs probably wouldn't overly rush it.\n\nMORE: Bills may not win the AFC East — but they sent a clear warning to the rest of the NFL\n\nAlso, the Chiefs don't even have a ton of incentive to get Mahomes back in the middle of the summer. Even if he was somehow cleared that fast, Kansas City wouldn't rush their legendary QB to get too much work in too quickly.\n\nRegardless of expectation, this is something that football fans everywhere will be watching closely. Mahomes' health will be a huge NFL storyline the entire offseason. And now we know what the Chiefs' doctor thinks of it.\n\nJaxson Dart has a 50% head injury problem\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a game never before done by an NFL quarterback\n\nA Travis Kelce retirement hint is coming\n\nTua Tagovailoa's contract looks like a nightmare\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury has fans asking Tom Brady ACL question\n\nThis Mike Tomlin horrible streak is hard to believe",

    "description": "Before each Kansas City Chiefs game, Travis Kelce arrives in style. His outfits this year have included designer sunglasses and a suit with shorts.",
    "fullText": "The top half of Kelce's suit looked great. He wore a blue Thom Browne jacket that was tailored perfectly, a matching tie, and a white undershirt.\n\nUnfortunately, he styled the jacket with tight-fitting shorts that reached his thighs. The bottoms were too casual and didn't match his dark dress shoes.\n\nKelce, who played against the Philadelphia Eagles that day, completed the look with a $1,035 pair of Dita sunglasses.\n\nHe arrived for a game against the New York Giants while wearing a blazer, vest, and trousers all in the same burgundy shade.\n\nHe also wore black dress boots, a white undershirt, and a matching pocket square. His square sunglasses, which retail for $725, were designed by Tom Ford.\n\nThe outfit was sharp, simple, and highlighted his Louis Vuitton luggage.\n\nAhead of a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Kelce donned khaki pants, a $2,650 Alfre button-up top from J. Logan Home, a brown suede jacket, and tan boots made from the same soft material.\n\nMost of the outfit worked as a transitional set for fall, especially when paired with his suede duffel bag.\n\nHowever, the suede newsboy cap Kelce wore dated the look. His overall outfit ended up resembling a costume more than a fashion statement.\n\nHe wore a $1,690 flannel top from Louis Vuitton, khaki pants, white sneakers, and Saint Laurent sunglasses before his game against the Detroit Lions.\n\nIt might not have been the most eye-catching outfit he wore this season, but it was contemporary and the epitome of quiet luxury.\n\nWhen the Chiefs played the Las Vegas Raiders in October, Kelce entered Arrowhead Stadium wearing skinny black trousers, a striped collared shirt, and a cropped leather jacket.\n\nThe top half of his outfit looked good, especially with the help of his square sunglasses.\n\nHowever, his choice of pants wasn't right. A baggier style would have made the difference, and some shining, silver jewelry could have elevated the overall look.\n\nKelce wore Fendi for a game against the Washington Commanders.\n\nHis three-piece outfit included orange jeans with frayed hems, a classic white T-shirt, and a denim jacket painted in shades of white and orange.\n\nThe outfit was bold and complemented by his tangerine-colored shades. He also wore statement gold necklaces with diamond charms.\n\nHe entered Arrowhead Stadium for a game against the Indianapolis Colts wearing a Nike windbreaker, matching pants, and Air Jordan sneakers.\n\nHis accessories — a hat, sunglasses, and watch — stood out and added a stylish element to the look.\n\nStill, the dark color and minimal design of his outfit made it forgettable.\n\nRather than wearing blue jeans and a basic flannel, Kelce walked into Arrowhead Stadium wearing a $1,790 tweed Amiri top, textured cargo pants from Diesel, and a $595 Guest In Residence hoodie.\n\nThe outfit was as festive as it was fashionable.",

In Week 15, it all came crashing down.\n\nNot only were the Chiefs ruled out of playoff contention as they dropped to 6-8, but late in the fourth quarter of their loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes went down with an injury that was later diagnosed as a torn ACL.\n\nFrom the start, it appeared to be a knee injury for Mahomes, who then limped back to the locker room with trainers. Postgame, head coach Andy Reid said the injury “didn’t look good,\" leaving some worry for the potential worst-case scenario that was later confirmed: a torn ACL.\n\nHere's the latest on Mahomes' injury, as well as a breakdown of how ACL injuries have impacted players' recovery in the past.\n\nSix reasons why the Chiefs never got over Super Bowl hangover\n\nPatrick Mahomes suffers knee injury on final drive of Chiefs-Chargers\n\nChiefs officially eliminated from NFL playoffs with loss to Chargers\n\nHow long Chiefs are expected to be without Patrick Mahomes after knee injury\n\nFollowing testing, Mahomes was officially diagnosed with a torn ACL on Sunday night, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\n\"An MRI has confirmed that Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in his left knee in today’s game,\" the Chiefs said in a statement. \"Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.\"\n\nMahomes also shared a message to fans on social media.\n\n\"Don’t know why this had to happen.

Mahomes' is considered fully torn, per the Chiefs, but his official timetable for recovery has not yet been revealed.\n\nBecause ACLs are responsible for many rapid movements, especially in football, the average recovery time can be anywhere from 6-12 months in the NFL, with a wide range based on the extent of the tear, whether not surgery is required, the player's age, and plenty more.\n\nPer Bass Medical Group, a torn ACL that requires surgery and rehab typically carries an 8-12 month recovery timeline in the NFL. Meanwhile, a mild MCL sprain is a 2-6 week recovery, and a complete MCL rupture is 3-6 months.\n\nThe severity of a torn ACL is determined in a grading system, like some other injuries.\n\nThe least severe type of ACL injury is a Grade 1 ailment, which means the ligament was stretched but is still intact. In this case, someone may have some mild pain and swelling, but it would not require surgery.\n\nA Grade 2 ACL tear means the ligament is loose, or partially torn. Surgery may depend on the severity of the injury, as it can sometimes heal non-surgically.\n\nThe worst-case scenario with ACL injuries is a complete tear, which is a Grade 3. The ligament is in two pieces, leading to knee instability and more severe pain. This often requires surgery to repair.\n\nIn the 2025 season alone, recent NFL players to be diagnosed with torn ACLs, in some capacity, include New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz and Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr.\n\nNabers' injury came in September, and an MRI confirmed a season-ending torn ACL. He is expected to return by the start of the 2026 season.\n\nErtz's injury was more recent, as he took a big hit in Week 14 that resulted in a torn ACL diagnosis. It's unknown whether the veteran tight end will retire, but he likely wouldn't be able to return until mid-way through the 2026 season.\n\nPenix partially tore his ACL, so his was not as severe as Nabers' or Ertz's. Per ESPN, Penix underwent surgery to have his ACL reconstructed in November with a nine-month recovery period expected, with hopes that he's ready for the start of the 2026 season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs' streak of 10 straight playoff appearances came to an end on Sunday with the loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, but star defensive lineman Chris Jones had no idea.\n\nFollowing the loss to the Chargers on Sunday, Jones believed that Kansas City still had at least a slim hope to make the playoffs while addressing reporters.\n\nBut they informed him that was not the case.\n\n\"We still have a fighting chance,\" Jones said, per Rachel Hallam of KWCH12. \"Are we out of the playoffs?\"\n\n\"We are? OK,\" Jones replied when a reporter told him the Chiefs were eliminated.\n\nEven if the Chiefs were still in contention, they really wouldn't be.\n\nThat's because Kansas City lost superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes to a torn ACL, which ends his season.\n\nMahomes suffered the injury in the fourth quarter and had to leave the game early. It was immediately clear Mahomes had suffered a significant injury, as he was in obvious pain and was clutching at his knee.\n\nHe later had to be helped to the locker room in what was no doubt a sobering moment for Chiefs fans.\n\nWhile Jones will certainly be on the team with his monster contract that runs through 2028, there could be a lot of change in Kansas City next year.\n\nThe problem is that the Chiefs cannot buy their way back to the playoffs, with the team projected to be $43.7 million over the cap, so that makes things much more difficult.\n\nAnd, Kansas City now has to worry if its franchise star is even going to be ready by Week 1, with Mahomes facing what could be a nine-month recovery.\n\nCan Cowboys still make the playoffs after Week 15 loss to Vikings?\n\nDavante Adams injury update from Rams leaves Week 16 status in doubt\n\nPackers' Micah Parsons feared to have season-ending injury\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury diagnosis is worst-case scenario for Chiefs\n\nPatrick Mahomes makes first public comment since knee injury",

    "fullText": "Times change, and with them, so do the names who are playing at the highest levels of professional football. And this season, a 14-year streak will be broken in the AFC as a pair of familiar faces will both be missing from the conference's championship game for the first time since the 2010 season.\n\nOn Sunday, the Chiefs were defeated by the Chargers and, in combination with a Buffalo Bills win, were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. That's significant here because it means this season, the AFC Championship game will take place without either Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes or former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady starting. That marks the first time since the 2010 season, when the two starting signal-callers were Ben Roethlisberger and Mark Sanchez.\n\nFrom the 2011-2017 seasons, Brady started for the Patriots in the AFC Championship game, winning four times to advance to the Super Bowl. In 2018, the Brady-led Patriots would square off with the Chiefs, who were under a first-year starter in Mahomes. The Patriots would go on to win that game 37-31 in overtime, and before winning Super Bowl LII over the Los Angeles Rams. The Patriots would fail to make the AFC Championship game the following season, which would be Brady's last with the franchise before he finished his career in Tampa Bay over three seasons.\n\nThe Chiefs, however, would not miss any more conference championship games for the foreseeable future, and from 2018-2024 made seven consecutive appearances in the AFC Championship, led by Mahomes, winning 5-of-6 from 2019-2024.\n\nBut one streak that can continue is the Patriots or Chiefs appearing in every AFC Championship game since the 2020 season, as Drake Maye has the Patriots at 11-3 and in prime position to be one of the top seeds in the AFC playoff bracket this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Chiefs postseason elimination breaks 14-year old AFC Playoff streak",

There's no way he envisioned missing the playoffs this season. And he certainly wouldn't have pictured his quarterback going down like this.\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nDoes any of that change the calculus in Kelce's head? That's only for him and future wife Taylor Swift to know.\n\nBut there's a very real chance we get a view of what Kelce is thinking in the final three weeks of the regular season.\n\nIt's not even in what he says or doesn't say. It's in what the Chiefs do.\n\nIf they play Kelce in three meaningless games to close out the season, that feels like they're letting him get a few more moments in before signing off, without concern about the future.\n\nIf the Chiefs decide to sit Kelce down the stretch, that points toward a player who is trying to preserve his health to make another go at it next season.\n\nMORE: Bills may not win the AFC East — but they sent a clear warning to the rest of the NFL\n\nOf course, Kelce himself could come out and make a proclamation one way or the other. He could also decide one thing now and change his mind in the offseason (during which he'll get married on June 13).\n\nBut keep an eye on what the Chiefs do with Kelce these last few weeks.

    "description": "Here are the key factors in the pivotal matchup between Kansas City and Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "On Sunday, the (6-7) Kansas City Chiefs will take on the division rival (9-4) Los Angeles Chargers in an AFC West showdown on Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium. The game will kick off at noon Arrowhead Time and will be broadcast on CBS — locally on KCTV5.\n\nThis game will be a rematch of the season opener, in which the Chargers won 27-21 in São Paulo, Brazil. Los Angeles has put together a strong season since, and is currently the top Wild Card team in the AFC playoff race. The Chiefs are on the outside looking in, and this season has been a major disappointment for the defending conference champions.\n\nTemperatures at kickoff are expected to be frigid. Since 2010, the Chiefs are 5-3 against the Chargers in December at Arrowhead.\n\nLast week, left tackle Esa Pole made his NFL debut after Wanya Morris left the game early with a knee injury. Both Morris and right tackle Jawaan Taylor have been declared out for this game, so Pole is slated to start again.\n\nThis is a golden opportunity for the undrafted rookie — who turned in a solid performance in his debut — to continue to make a case for a roster spot in 2026. Morris is slated to be a free agent, while Taylor could be a cap casualty. So if he plays well enough, Pole has a chance to compete for a starting job or a shot at being the team’s new swing tackle.\n\nSimilar to the Houston Texans, Los Angeles has a solid pass rush featuring veteran outside linebacker Khalil Mack and rising star Tuli Tuipulotu off the edge. But unlike the Texans, the Chargers’ pass rush relies on power, which will give Pole a new set of obstacles to overcome. If he turns in another solid performance, it will be worth keeping him on the field through the end of the season.\n\nThird downs will be critical this week. Los Angeles’ offense converts at a 47% rate, the third-highest in the NFL, while the Chiefs rank 13th at 40%. Defensively, the Chargers allow the fourth-lowest percentage of third-down conversions (34%), while Kansas City ranks 26th at 43%.\n\nThe Chiefs’ struggles to defend third down were apparent last week. The defense allowed eight conversions over 18 attempts against Houston — and the week prior, nine of 16 third downs against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe Chiefs’ issues on third-down defense stem from the inability to create pressure in passing situations. That started in Week 1, when Los Angeles converted seven of 13 third downs.\n\nThe Chargers rank second in the NFL in time of possession per game, averaging 32:56 per game. Los Angeles excels at keeping teams off balance on early downs, while setting up manageable third downs where the powerful run game helps move the sticks.\n\nThis presents a layered problem for Kansas City’s defense that has been one of the least effective units under Chiefs’ defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.\n\nThis could be one of the lower-scoring games in the recent history of this rivalry. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, the Over/Under is listed at only 41.5 points — and the very cold weather expected on Sunday could also be a factor.\n\nBoth teams rank among the top 10 in points allowed per game: Kansas City surrenders 19.4 points per game, while the Chargers allow 20.8 points per contest.\n\nEach franchise ranks in the upper third of the league in points scored per game, but both have serious offensive line issues that could hinder the strategy. The Chiefs’ game plan in Week 14 was boosted by a backup-heavy offensive line, and Los Angeles has had its own struggles protecting quarterback Justin Herbert.\n\nTo win this game, Kansas City needs bounce-back performances from its top two pass-catchers after a horrible game in Week 14. Rice caught only four catches for 34 yards, while Kelce had one catch for eight. Both players dropped passes at key times; one resulted in a turnover on downs, and the other ended as an interception.\n\nIt was an embarrassing effort by the two players who directly contributed to the loss. The Chiefs have a higher standard for both.\n\nNeither player spoke to the media after the game; it appeared frustrations from this long season had boiled over. Leadership is desperately needed for this team right now, and it starts at the top. Anything can happen in the NFL, but if the Chiefs want to even imagine making the playoffs, then they need all-out efforts from Kelce and Rice on Sunday.\n\nDue to injuries on the Chargers’ offensive line, Herbert has been one of the most hit and pressured quarterbacks in the NFL this season. He is the third-most sacked quarterback — having taken 45 this year — and has taken the second most hits (61) on the season.\n\nThe beating has taken its toll, and Herbert is playing with a broken left hand, which has limited what the Chargers can do offensively. The Chiefs’ pass rush has struggled to generate pressure this season, but getting after Herbert will be a key to Sunday’s game.",

    "fullText": "JOPLIN, Mo. — A popular annual promotion returns — giving you a chance at free furniture for Christmas.\n\nJoplin’s Wayside Furniture is bringing back its 12 days of Christmas for customers who buy furniture between tomorrow and noon Christmas Eve.\n\nIt’s simple: if the Chiefs beat the Denver Broncos by 18 points or more during their Christmas game, customers get their money back – except for sales tax.\n\nThe 12 days of Christmas deal has been a hit for 5 years now, especially since last year when the Chiefs finally made it happen, by beating the Pittsburg Steelers by 19 points.\n\n“It’s also great for the community. So, I mean, if it does happen, I’m not saying it is going to, you know, 100 over 140 people got their furniture for free. So, I mean, that’s that’s really a blessing for everybody that got their money back last year. And I you know, if it would happen again, it would really be something,” said Allen Trimble, Wayside Furniture Joplin owner.\n\nIf KC wins, the furniture isn’t totally free, customers still have to pay the sales tax.",
