    "title": "Chiefs-Chargers: 5 things to watch in Week 15 contest",
    "description": "Here are the key factors in the pivotal matchup between Kansas City and Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "On Sunday, the (6-7) Kansas City Chiefs will take on the division rival (9-4) Los Angeles Chargers in an AFC West showdown on Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium. The game will kick off at noon Arrowhead Time and will be broadcast on CBS — locally on KCTV5.\n\nThis game will be a rematch of the season opener, in which the Chargers won 27-21 in São Paulo, Brazil. Los Angeles has put together a strong season since, and is currently the top Wild Card team in the AFC playoff race. The Chiefs are on the outside looking in, and this season has been a major disappointment for the defending conference champions.\n\nTemperatures at kickoff are expected to be frigid. Since 2010, the Chiefs are 5-3 against the Chargers in December at Arrowhead.\n\nLast week, left tackle Esa Pole made his NFL debut after Wanya Morris left the game early with a knee injury. Both Morris and right tackle Jawaan Taylor have been declared out for this game, so Pole is slated to start again.\n\nThis is a golden opportunity for the undrafted rookie — who turned in a solid performance in his debut — to continue to make a case for a roster spot in 2026. Morris is slated to be a free agent, while Taylor could be a cap casualty. So if he plays well enough, Pole has a chance to compete for a starting job or a shot at being the team’s new swing tackle.\n\nSimilar to the Houston Texans, Los Angeles has a solid pass rush featuring veteran outside linebacker Khalil Mack and rising star Tuli Tuipulotu off the edge. But unlike the Texans, the Chargers’ pass rush relies on power, which will give Pole a new set of obstacles to overcome. If he turns in another solid performance, it will be worth keeping him on the field through the end of the season.\n\nThird downs will be critical this week. Los Angeles’ offense converts at a 47% rate, the third-highest in the NFL, while the Chiefs rank 13th at 40%. Defensively, the Chargers allow the fourth-lowest percentage of third-down conversions (34%), while Kansas City ranks 26th at 43%.\n\nThe Chiefs’ struggles to defend third down were apparent last week. The defense allowed eight conversions over 18 attempts against Houston — and the week prior, nine of 16 third downs against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe Chiefs’ issues on third-down defense stem from the inability to create pressure in passing situations. That started in Week 1, when Los Angeles converted seven of 13 third downs.\n\nThe Chargers rank second in the NFL in time of possession per game, averaging 32:56 per game. Los Angeles excels at keeping teams off balance on early downs, while setting up manageable third downs where the powerful run game helps move the sticks.\n\nThis presents a layered problem for Kansas City’s defense that has been one of the least effective units under Chiefs’ defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.\n\nThis could be one of the lower-scoring games in the recent history of this rivalry. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, the Over/Under is listed at only 41.5 points — and the very cold weather expected on Sunday could also be a factor.\n\nBoth teams rank among the top 10 in points allowed per game: Kansas City surrenders 19.4 points per game, while the Chargers allow 20.8 points per contest.\n\nEach franchise ranks in the upper third of the league in points scored per game, but both have serious offensive line issues that could hinder the strategy. The Chiefs’ game plan in Week 14 was boosted by a backup-heavy offensive line, and Los Angeles has had its own struggles protecting quarterback Justin Herbert.\n\nTo win this game, Kansas City needs bounce-back performances from its top two pass-catchers after a horrible game in Week 14. Rice caught only four catches for 34 yards, while Kelce had one catch for eight. Both players dropped passes at key times; one resulted in a turnover on downs, and the other ended as an interception.\n\nIt was an embarrassing effort by the two players who directly contributed to the loss. The Chiefs have a higher standard for both.\n\nNeither player spoke to the media after the game; it appeared frustrations from this long season had boiled over. Leadership is desperately needed for this team right now, and it starts at the top. Anything can happen in the NFL, but if the Chiefs want to even imagine making the playoffs, then they need all-out efforts from Kelce and Rice on Sunday.\n\nDue to injuries on the Chargers’ offensive line, Herbert has been one of the most hit and pressured quarterbacks in the NFL this season. He is the third-most sacked quarterback — having taken 45 this year — and has taken the second most hits (61) on the season.\n\nThe beating has taken its toll, and Herbert is playing with a broken left hand, which has limited what the Chargers can do offensively. The Chiefs’ pass rush has struggled to generate pressure this season, but getting after Herbert will be a key to Sunday’s game.",
