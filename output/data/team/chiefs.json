    "fullText": "Things went from bad to worse for the Kansas City Chiefs at the quarterback position on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nThe Chiefs had already taken a major blow as they lost starting quarterback and multi-time Super Bowl Champion Patrick Mahomes last week to a torn ACL in a loss to the Chargers that eliminated the team from playoff contention for the first time in over a decade. But just when Chiefs fans thought the tough times couldn't get much tougher, that is exactly what happened as backup quarterback Gardner Minshew left the game against the Titans due to injury.\n\nThe real kicker? Early reports indicate that Minshew also tore his ACL, becoming the second quarterback for the Chiefs to do so in two weeks – and forcing Kansas City into a position where they will have to finish their last two games without their top two quarterbacks.\n\nChiefs are concerned that QB Gardner Minshew tore his ACL, as @mattderrick also reported. There will be additional tests but Minshew could be the second Chiefs’ quarterback in two games to tear his ACL. pic.twitter.com/vDVoxOTGKb\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 21, 2025\n\nTo add insult to (literal) injury, the Chiefs would end up losing the game to the Titans 26-9, handing Tennessee just their third win of the season in the process. Kansas City dropped to 6-9 overall with the loss, further worsening an already disappointing season for the Chiefs which still features an upcoming game with the AFC West leader and potential top AFC playoff seed the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Chiefs will now turn to third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, who starred in college at South Florida, Samford, and South Dakota State before being drafted in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Steelers before eventually landing in Kansas City.\n\nHe entered Sunday's loss to the Chiefs following the injury to Minshew, and completed his first career pass on a touchdown to Travis Kelce. He would finish the game 11-of-16 with 111 passing yards and two carries for seven yards, but it was not enough to help the Chiefs to victory.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Brutal QB luck continues for Chiefs with Gardner Minshew injury",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is recalling nearly 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial and other senior embassy posts as it moves to reshape the U.S. diplomatic posture abroad with personnel deemed fully supportive of President Donald Trump’s “America First” priorities.\n\nThe chiefs of mission in at least 29 countries were informed last week that their tenures would end in January, according to two State Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel moves.\n\nAll of them had taken up their posts in the Biden administration but had survived an initial purge in the early months of Trump’s second term that targeted mainly political appointees. That changed on Wednesday when they began to receive notices from officials in Washington about their imminent departures.\n\nAmbassadors serve at the pleasure of the president although they typically remain at their posts for three to four years. Those affected by the shake-up are not losing their foreign service jobs but will be returning to Washington for other assignments should they wish to take them, the officials said.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on specific numbers or ambassadors affected, but defended the changes, calling them “a standard process in any administration.” It noted that an ambassador is “a personal representative of the president and it is the president’s right to ensure that he has individuals in these countries who advance the America First agenda.”\n\nAfrica is the continent most affected by the removals, with ambassadors from 13 countries being removed: Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSecond is Asia, with ambassadorial changes coming to six countries: Fiji, Laos, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam affected.\n\nFour countries in Europe (Armenia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Slovakia) are affected; as are two each in the Middle East (Algeria and Egypt); South and Central Asia (Nepal and Sri Lanka); and the Western Hemisphere (Guatemala and Suriname).\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the ambassadorial recalls, which have drawn concern from some lawmakers and the union representing American diplomats.",

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs are traveling to Nashville to face the Tennessee Titans in Week 16. The game will be played at noon CST/1:00 p.m. EST on CBS.\n\nThe Chiefs and Titans both come in hobbled, but this game will be crucial for draft positioning.\n\nThe Titans have reasons to be optimistic for a win this week. Here are three of them.\n\nThe Chiefs come into this game majorly banged up and without incentive to win after being eliminated from playoff contention. Their injury list on Thursday read like a grocery list. Rashee Rice, the Chiefs' best wide receiver, will likely miss the game. Chris Jones is managing a hamstring issue, Jawaan Taylor with an elbow issue, and Jaylon Moore with a knee issue. That's two offensive tackles in an already banged-up offensive line. Of course, Patrick Mahomes was also put on the injured reserve. That Mahomes' injury has led the team to put Gardner Minshew in his stead.\n\nMinshew is a familiar quarterback for the Titans' defense. They have played him many times over the years, having had crucial stints as the Jaguars' and Colts' quarterback. Most recently, this team faced him in 2023 when he was manning the Colts. This familiarity with Minshew will help the Titans' game plan, having faced him six times before. This familiarity goes in the Titans' favor.\n\nThe Titans' offensive line has been putting together great performances, making it two weeks in a row now. They allowed zero sacks last week and were creating monstrous holes for Tony Pollard to run into. With the injuries on the Chiefs' defensive line, they have a good shot of building on their previous performances. Confidence is rising that this unit should stick together into next season. What's most crucial for the offensive line now is finishing this season healthy and having a healthy offseason together.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Tennessee Titans vs. Chiefs: 3 reasons for optimism in Week 16",

    "title": "Exclusive: Top lawyer for military joint chiefs told chairman that officers should retire if faced with an unlawful order",
    "description": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?",
    "fullText": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?\n\nRequest to retire — and refrain from resigning in protest, which could be seen as a political act, or picking a fight to get fired.\n\nThat was the previously unreported guidance that Brig. Gen. Eric Widmar, the top lawyer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave to the country’s top general, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, in November, according to sources familiar with the discussion.\n\nCaine had just seen a video that included six Democratic lawmakers publicly urging US troops to disobey illegal orders. He asked Widmar, according to the sources, what the latest guidance was on how to determine whether an order was lawful and how a commander should reply if it is not.\n\nWidmar responded that they should consult with their legal adviser if they’re unsure, the sources said. But ultimately, if they determine that an order is illegal, they should consider requesting retirement.\n\nThe guidance sheds new light on how top military officials are thinking about an issue that has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, as lawmakers and legal experts have repeatedly questioned the legality of the US military’s counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean including intense scrutiny of a “double-tap” strike that deliberately killed survivors on September 2.\n\nCaine is not in the chain of command. But he is closely involved in operations, including those in SOUTHCOM, and is often tasked with presenting military options to the president—more so than Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, CNN has reported.\n\nThe Joint Staff declined to comment for this story.\n\nSeveral senior officers who reportedly expressed concerns about the boat strikes, including former US Southern Command commander Adm. Alvin Holsey and Lt. Gen. Joe McGee, the former director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, have retired early in recent months.\n\nWidmar’s advice to Caine was meant to help inform the chairman’s discussions with senior military officials should the issue come up, the sources said. The Democrats’ video had become headline news, enraging Hegseth and sparking debates across the country.\n\nA separate official familiar with military legal advice said that it is not uncommon for lawyers to urge servicemembers to consider leaving the force if they believe they’re being asked to do something they are personally uncomfortable with, but it’s typically handled on a case-by-case basis and tailored to the facts of the situation.\n\nOther current and former US officials, however, including those who have served as miliary lawyers in the Judge Advocate General corps, stressed that broadly encouraging servicemembers to quietly retire — if they’re eligible — rather than voice dissent in the face of a potentially illegal order risks perpetuating a culture of silence and lack of accountability.\n\n“A commissioned officer has every right to say, ‘this is wrong,’ and shouldn’t be expected to quietly and silently walk away just because they’re given a free pass to do so,” said a former senior defense official who left the Pentagon earlier this year.\n\nMore than a dozen senior officers have either been fired or retired early since Trump took office in January, an unusually high rate of turnover. In a speech before hundreds of general and flag officers in September, Hegseth directed officers to “do the honorable thing and resign” if they didn’t agree with his vision for the department.\n\nBut disagreeing with the direction of the military is different than viewing an order as illegal, legal experts said.\n\nDan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former JAG lawyer, said that the guidance, as described by CNN, appears to “misunderstand what a servicemember is supposed to do in the face of an unlawful order: disobey it if confident that the order is unlawful and attempt to persuade the order-giver to stop or modify it have failed, and report it through the chain of command.”\n\nMaurer added that “if the guidance does not explicitly advise servicemembers that they have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the guidance is not a legitimate statement of professional military ethics and the law.”\n\nWidmar advised that an order may be unlawful if it is “patently illegal,” or something an ordinary person would recognize instinctively as a violation of domestic or international law, the sources said — the My Lai massacre in Vietnam is an oft-used example. But the guidance he provided was that an unlawful order should be met with retirement, if possible, and did not note that servicemembers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the sources said.\n\n“It’s a very safe recommendation in this current political environment,” said the former senior defense official. “But that doesn’t make it the right or ethical one.”\n\nExperts on civil military relations have previously pointed to retirement as a reasonable option for officers who object to a particular policy, while noting that it comes with its own costs.\n\nIn a September article that has been discussed amongst the Joint Staff and other senior military officials, Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University, and Heidi Urben, a former Army intelligence officer and current associate director of Georgetown University’s security studies program, wrote that “quiet quitting”, or opting for retirement “allows officers with professionally grounded objections to leave without posing a direct challenge to civilian control.”\n\nAnd while officers shouldn’t resign in protest or pick fights, they argued, they should “speak up” and “show moral courage” when the military’s professional values and ideals are at risk.\n\nAnd they should be willing to be fired for it. “Complete silence can be corrosive to good order and discipline and signal to the force that the military’s professional values and norms are expendable,” they wrote.\n\nMaurer, the former Army officer, said the advice to retire in the face of an unlawful order also functions to “keep that person silent in perpetuity, because as a retiree he or she remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which criminalizes a broad range of conduct and speech that would be constitutionally protected for regular civilians.”\n\nThose constraints have been apparent as the Pentagon has launched an investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and one of the Democratic lawmakers seen in the video encouraging troops to disobey unlawful orders, which prompted Caine to seek the legal advice.\n\nAs questions continue to swirl around the legality of the boat strike campaign, Widmar also advised Caine that Article II of the Constitution gives the president the authority to authorize lethal force to protect the nation, unless hostilities rise to the level of a full-blown war — in which case Congressional approval is required, the sources said.\n\nWhether the president’s orders are legal to begin with, Widmar advised according to the sources, is a question only the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel can answer, due to the executive order Trump issued in February that says the president and the attorney general’s “opinions on questions of law are controlling” on all executive branch employees — to include US troops.\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel determined in September that it is legal for Trump to order strikes on suspected drug boats because they pose an imminent threat to the United States, CNN has reported.\n\nSince September 2, the US military has killed at least 99 people across dozens of strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, arguing that those targeted were “narcoterrorists” that pose a direct threat to the United States. The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n\nLawmakers have said that Pentagon officials have acknowledged in private briefings not knowing the identities of everyone on board a vessel before striking it; instead, military officials only need to confirm that the individuals are affiliated with a cartel or criminal organization to target them.\n\nSome members of Congress, legal experts and human rights groups have argued that potential drug traffickers are civilians who should not be summarily killed but arrested—something the Coast Guard did routinely, and continues to do in the eastern Pacific, when encountering a suspected drug trafficking vessel.\n\nCNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe College Football Playoff will feature plenty of great future NFL talent with the 12 teams making the field. While it might not be surprising Ohio State's loaded team dominates the pro prospects, 18 of Sporting News' 32 first-round projections in all are tied to CFP action.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead with five such picks, with Georgia, Oregon, Texas A&M, Alabama and Miami also in line to have multiple selections on Day 1. Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas Tech get on the board, too. That's incredible representation from three-fourths of the CFP teams, which also account for all three QBs and four of the first five overall picks.\n\nHere is the Sporting News' latest NFL Mock Draft ahead of the 2025 College Football playoff.\n\nMORE: Bills, 49ers rise as Packers fade in latest SN Power Rankings\n\n(No. 1-18 order courtesy of Tankathon; No. 19-32 from Week 16 playoff picture)\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Giants, if they stay at No. 1 overall and don't trade out of this pick for a team wanting a quarterback, should consider taking Reese as an all-around force to fix a lot of their defensive issues away from a rather productive pass rush.\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (6-5, 225 pounds)\n\nThe Raiders can't be happy with their quarterback situation post-Derek Carr, with Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett screaming that they need to go after a true, strong, accurate franchise passer solution. Mendoza looks the part with his arm and intangibles, two things that should appeal to the influence of Tom Brady.\n\nMORE: How Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman over Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin\n\nRueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-3, 275 pounds)\n\nThe Titans also don't need a QB after taking Cam Ward No. 1 overall last year, but they can go back to the Hurricanes program to get the game-changing pass-rusher they desperately need for their latest defensive reboot.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State (6-2, 200 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to stop messing around at wide receiver and give either Shedeur Sanders or a different starting quarterback a true go-to all over the field, both in the slot and outside, in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jaxon Smith-Njigba vein, only lacking the hyphen.\n\nDante Moore, QB, Oregon (6-3, 206 pounds)\n\nMoore has the leadership and intangibles to handle being the next shot at a franchise QB in New York as well as the savvy and strong arm. They also need to get a real long-term option after the Justin Fields flop.\n\nTroy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Network\n\nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (6-0, 214 pounds)\n\nThe Cardinals saw the breakdown early of pending free agent James Conner and have had an unhealthy mess of a committee trying to replace him. This may seem like a luxury pick for a team that has a lot of needs, but they can get some tackle help later and Love can be a game-changer for restoring balance and expanding the explosiveness.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC (5-11, 195 pounds)\n\nThe Saints, should they stick with Tyler Shough at QB, need to give him more weapons after depleting the receiving crops beyond Chris Olave.

Brown should Shough show big improvement.\n\nMORE: Sporting News' expert predictions for 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State (6-0, 205 pounds)\n\nThe Commanders need to get younger and more impactful in their defense after things fell apart in their secondary and around Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Downs is a terrific do-everything hybrid who would be set up to make a lot of big plays in Dan Quinn's scheme.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson (6-3, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Bengals need to keep beefing up their defensive line to pull out of being atrocious against the run and it doesn't hurt to have some of Woods' inside pass-rush juice to support their end rotation.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee (6-0, 193 pounds)\n\nThe Rams know that cornerback coverage is their biggest weakness on an otherwise loaded roster, with some retooling needed. They keep up the strong defensive pick momentum with the nice-sized, tough McCoy.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT, Miami (6-6, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Dolphins need to get more offensive line help for wherever they go at QB and they can stay in town to get a long-term all-around rock in Mauigoa.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon (6-3, 245 pounds)\n\nThe Chiefs need to be feeling the imminence of Travis Kelce's retirement and can step right into drafting his dynamic go-to receiver replacement to boost Patrick Mahomes again once he returns from his torn ACL.\n\nMORE: Why it's not time to announce the Chiefs dynasty over yet\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Vikings will need to keep working on their secondary with some contract issues ahead and Delane is not that far off in battling McCoy for the status as the best corner in this class.\n\nDavid Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech (6-3, 250 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys will go to work on replacing Micah Parsons' pass rush production with this Lubbock chess piece who has all the moves to get to the quarterback as well as unique dropback coverage ability for the position.\n\nMORE: Full list of stadiums hosting 2025 College Football Playoff games\n\nKeldric Faulk, EDGE, Auburn (6-6, 285 pounds)\n\nThe Ravens should love this complete outside linebacker option who can provide power vs. the run as well as needed pass-rush juice.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Panthers have been feeling the void at linebacker for a while after it was once a strength and GM Dan Morgan should have intrigue to go for his former position with Styles, a versatile talent who makes a lot of plays everywhere along with Reese.\n\nCashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M (6-2, 248 pounds)\n\nHowell can give the Lions the needed strong complementary pass rusher for Aidan Hutchinson to relieve their secondary coverage a lot more next season.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson (5-11, 180 pounds)\n\nThe Jets, after going QB with Moore earlier in this mock, can get their Sauce Gardner replacement with the pick acquired in that trade with Terrell, brother of Falcons star A.J.\n\nMORE: Latest news on QBs entering NCAA transfer portal\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah (6-6, 302 pounds)\n\nThe Texans have gotten surprising returns from rookie Aireontay Ersery and the rest of their rebuilt line but should be in the market to boost pass protection and run blocking at either right tackle or guard with Fano.\n\nT.J. Parker, EDGE, Clemson (6-3, 265 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys shouldn't mind doubling up on pass-rush help here with Parker and Bailey, as Parker can provide more traditional burst and finishing moves from defensive end to help Quinnen Williams in Matt Eberflus' front four.\n\nCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State (6-3, 195 pounds)\n\nThe 49ers seem ready to cut ties with injured Brandon Aiyuk, which means they will need to find a dynamic speedy big target for Brock Purdy to better take advantage of his ace deep passing.

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce entered the 2025-’26 NFL season looking to win a fourth Super Bowl with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, but it all fell apart in Week 15. In the fourth quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers, Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL. The Chiefs lost 16-13 and were eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nIt was a very disappointing season for Kansas City as the offense never found a consistent rhythm, even with Mahomes and Kelce playing really well. Following the game, the Chiefs’ tight end refused to speak to the media, citing that it wasn’t the right time.\n\nNow, Kelce has broken his silence on Mahomes’ brutal ACL injury, while sending a possible hint on his future with the Chiefs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jason and Travis Kelce released their “New Heights” podcast after Week 15. Many were waiting to hear what the Kansas City tight end was going to say about Mahomes, but they didn’t expect the possible hint about his future.\n\n“[Patrick Mahomes] is a fearless, fearless warrior when it comes to this football thing,” Kelce said. “He’s gonna make sure that he comes back stronger than ever. Hopefully, the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible. I know right now it’s kind of right around that, Week 1 or the beginning of the season next year. I know he’s going to be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs as soon as possible.”\n\nKelce’s decision to say “the Chiefs” instead of “we” has stirred up some discussion on social media that he has already made up his mind about retirement. In the midst of a tough 2025 NFL season, it is not shocking to hear that Kelce might have already made up his mind after coming off a loss in the Super Bowl.\n\nIf so, this means that Kelce has caught his final pass from Mahomes, as Gardner Minshew appears to be the starting quarterback for the rest of the NFL season. Based on Kelce’s comments, it seems like these will be his final three games in the NFL before entering retirement as well.\n\nFranciso Lindor Traded to LA Dodgers, and 4 Other Destinations Following Weird Trump Rumor\n\n‘We’re going no matter what’: Sirens dismiss Olympic rink worries\n\nAlex Bregman Free Agency Rumors Link Him to Surprise NL West Team in 2025",

    "fullText": "Chiefs' doctor shares wildly confusing timeline for Patrick Mahomes' return from torn ACL originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs did the football world a solid on Wednesday. They made their medical director available to talk to the media about Patrick Mahomes after the superstar QB's torn ACL.\n\nThat's Rick Burkholder, the Chiefs' Vice President of Sports Medicine and Performance. And while he provided some concrete thoughts, he also made Mahomes' injury return timeline quite a bit more confusing, at least if you squint.\n\nThis is what The Kansas City Star's Sam McDowell shared on X:\n\n\"Rick Burkholder, Chiefs Vice President of Sports Medicine and Performance, said the ballpark timeline for the Patrick Mahomes type of injury is 9 months, but it could be a month or two less or a month or two longer.\"\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nOK, so that nine-month timeline is what is being thrown around a lot. And the fact that it could take a month or two longer isn't crazy. Players have taken closer to a full year to return from torn ACLs before.\n\nBut wait, \"a month or two less\"?\n\nIf our math is right, that'd get Mahomes back in... seven months, at the earliest? Mid July?\n\nThat seems pretty outlandish based on just about all the evidence of this injury ever, especially considering this is one of the few most important athletes in the entire world of professional sports. The Chiefs probably wouldn't overly rush it.\n\nMORE: Bills may not win the AFC East — but they sent a clear warning to the rest of the NFL\n\nAlso, the Chiefs don't even have a ton of incentive to get Mahomes back in the middle of the summer. Even if he was somehow cleared that fast, Kansas City wouldn't rush their legendary QB to get too much work in too quickly.\n\nRegardless of expectation, this is something that football fans everywhere will be watching closely. Mahomes' health will be a huge NFL storyline the entire offseason. And now we know what the Chiefs' doctor thinks of it.\n\nJaxson Dart has a 50% head injury problem\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a game never before done by an NFL quarterback\n\nA Travis Kelce retirement hint is coming\n\nTua Tagovailoa's contract looks like a nightmare\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury has fans asking Tom Brady ACL question\n\nThis Mike Tomlin horrible streak is hard to believe",

    "description": "Before each Kansas City Chiefs game, Travis Kelce arrives in style. His outfits this year have included designer sunglasses and a suit with shorts.",
    "fullText": "The top half of Kelce's suit looked great. He wore a blue Thom Browne jacket that was tailored perfectly, a matching tie, and a white undershirt.\n\nUnfortunately, he styled the jacket with tight-fitting shorts that reached his thighs. The bottoms were too casual and didn't match his dark dress shoes.\n\nKelce, who played against the Philadelphia Eagles that day, completed the look with a $1,035 pair of Dita sunglasses.\n\nHe arrived for a game against the New York Giants while wearing a blazer, vest, and trousers all in the same burgundy shade.\n\nHe also wore black dress boots, a white undershirt, and a matching pocket square. His square sunglasses, which retail for $725, were designed by Tom Ford.\n\nThe outfit was sharp, simple, and highlighted his Louis Vuitton luggage.\n\nAhead of a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Kelce donned khaki pants, a $2,650 Alfre button-up top from J. Logan Home, a brown suede jacket, and tan boots made from the same soft material.\n\nMost of the outfit worked as a transitional set for fall, especially when paired with his suede duffel bag.\n\nHowever, the suede newsboy cap Kelce wore dated the look. His overall outfit ended up resembling a costume more than a fashion statement.\n\nHe wore a $1,690 flannel top from Louis Vuitton, khaki pants, white sneakers, and Saint Laurent sunglasses before his game against the Detroit Lions.\n\nIt might not have been the most eye-catching outfit he wore this season, but it was contemporary and the epitome of quiet luxury.\n\nWhen the Chiefs played the Las Vegas Raiders in October, Kelce entered Arrowhead Stadium wearing skinny black trousers, a striped collared shirt, and a cropped leather jacket.\n\nThe top half of his outfit looked good, especially with the help of his square sunglasses.\n\nHowever, his choice of pants wasn't right. A baggier style would have made the difference, and some shining, silver jewelry could have elevated the overall look.\n\nKelce wore Fendi for a game against the Washington Commanders.\n\nHis three-piece outfit included orange jeans with frayed hems, a classic white T-shirt, and a denim jacket painted in shades of white and orange.\n\nThe outfit was bold and complemented by his tangerine-colored shades. He also wore statement gold necklaces with diamond charms.\n\nHe entered Arrowhead Stadium for a game against the Indianapolis Colts wearing a Nike windbreaker, matching pants, and Air Jordan sneakers.\n\nHis accessories — a hat, sunglasses, and watch — stood out and added a stylish element to the look.\n\nStill, the dark color and minimal design of his outfit made it forgettable.\n\nRather than wearing blue jeans and a basic flannel, Kelce walked into Arrowhead Stadium wearing a $1,790 tweed Amiri top, textured cargo pants from Diesel, and a $595 Guest In Residence hoodie.\n\nThe outfit was as festive as it was fashionable.",

Postgame, head coach Andy Reid said the injury “didn’t look good,\" leaving some worry for the potential worst-case scenario that was later confirmed: a torn ACL.\n\nHere's the latest on Mahomes' injury, as well as a breakdown of how ACL injuries have impacted players' recovery in the past.\n\nSix reasons why the Chiefs never got over Super Bowl hangover\n\nPatrick Mahomes suffers knee injury on final drive of Chiefs-Chargers\n\nChiefs officially eliminated from NFL playoffs with loss to Chargers\n\nHow long Chiefs are expected to be without Patrick Mahomes after knee injury\n\nFollowing testing, Mahomes was officially diagnosed with a torn ACL on Sunday night, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\n\"An MRI has confirmed that Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in his left knee in today’s game,\" the Chiefs said in a statement. \"Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.\"\n\nMahomes also shared a message to fans on social media.\n\n\"Don’t know why this had to happen.

Mahomes' is considered fully torn, per the Chiefs, but his official timetable for recovery has not yet been revealed.\n\nBecause ACLs are responsible for many rapid movements, especially in football, the average recovery time can be anywhere from 6-12 months in the NFL, with a wide range based on the extent of the tear, whether not surgery is required, the player's age, and plenty more.\n\nPer Bass Medical Group, a torn ACL that requires surgery and rehab typically carries an 8-12 month recovery timeline in the NFL. Meanwhile, a mild MCL sprain is a 2-6 week recovery, and a complete MCL rupture is 3-6 months.\n\nThe severity of a torn ACL is determined in a grading system, like some other injuries.\n\nThe least severe type of ACL injury is a Grade 1 ailment, which means the ligament was stretched but is still intact. In this case, someone may have some mild pain and swelling, but it would not require surgery.\n\nA Grade 2 ACL tear means the ligament is loose, or partially torn. Surgery may depend on the severity of the injury, as it can sometimes heal non-surgically.\n\nThe worst-case scenario with ACL injuries is a complete tear, which is a Grade 3. The ligament is in two pieces, leading to knee instability and more severe pain. This often requires surgery to repair.\n\nIn the 2025 season alone, recent NFL players to be diagnosed with torn ACLs, in some capacity, include New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz and Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr.\n\nNabers' injury came in September, and an MRI confirmed a season-ending torn ACL. He is expected to return by the start of the 2026 season.\n\nErtz's injury was more recent, as he took a big hit in Week 14 that resulted in a torn ACL diagnosis. It's unknown whether the veteran tight end will retire, but he likely wouldn't be able to return until mid-way through the 2026 season.\n\nPenix partially tore his ACL, so his was not as severe as Nabers' or Ertz's. Per ESPN, Penix underwent surgery to have his ACL reconstructed in November with a nine-month recovery period expected, with hopes that he's ready for the start of the 2026 season.",

OK,\" Jones replied when a reporter told him the Chiefs were eliminated.\n\nEven if the Chiefs were still in contention, they really wouldn't be.\n\nThat's because Kansas City lost superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes to a torn ACL, which ends his season.\n\nMahomes suffered the injury in the fourth quarter and had to leave the game early. It was immediately clear Mahomes had suffered a significant injury, as he was in obvious pain and was clutching at his knee.\n\nHe later had to be helped to the locker room in what was no doubt a sobering moment for Chiefs fans.\n\nWhile Jones will certainly be on the team with his monster contract that runs through 2028, there could be a lot of change in Kansas City next year.\n\nThe problem is that the Chiefs cannot buy their way back to the playoffs, with the team projected to be $43.7 million over the cap, so that makes things much more difficult.\n\nAnd, Kansas City now has to worry if its franchise star is even going to be ready by Week 1, with Mahomes facing what could be a nine-month recovery.\n\nCan Cowboys still make the playoffs after Week 15 loss to Vikings?\n\nDavante Adams injury update from Rams leaves Week 16 status in doubt\n\nPackers' Micah Parsons feared to have season-ending injury\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury diagnosis is worst-case scenario for Chiefs\n\nPatrick Mahomes makes first public comment since knee injury",

And this season, a 14-year streak will be broken in the AFC as a pair of familiar faces will both be missing from the conference's championship game for the first time since the 2010 season.\n\nOn Sunday, the Chiefs were defeated by the Chargers and, in combination with a Buffalo Bills win, were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. That's significant here because it means this season, the AFC Championship game will take place without either Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes or former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady starting. That marks the first time since the 2010 season, when the two starting signal-callers were Ben Roethlisberger and Mark Sanchez.\n\nFrom the 2011-2017 seasons, Brady started for the Patriots in the AFC Championship game, winning four times to advance to the Super Bowl. In 2018, the Brady-led Patriots would square off with the Chiefs, who were under a first-year starter in Mahomes. The Patriots would go on to win that game 37-31 in overtime, and before winning Super Bowl LII over the Los Angeles Rams. The Patriots would fail to make the AFC Championship game the following season, which would be Brady's last with the franchise before he finished his career in Tampa Bay over three seasons.\n\nThe Chiefs, however, would not miss any more conference championship games for the foreseeable future, and from 2018-2024 made seven consecutive appearances in the AFC Championship, led by Mahomes, winning 5-of-6 from 2019-2024.\n\nBut one streak that can continue is the Patriots or Chiefs appearing in every AFC Championship game since the 2020 season, as Drake Maye has the Patriots at 11-3 and in prime position to be one of the top seeds in the AFC playoff bracket this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Chiefs postseason elimination breaks 14-year old AFC Playoff streak",

There's no way he envisioned missing the playoffs this season. And he certainly wouldn't have pictured his quarterback going down like this.\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nDoes any of that change the calculus in Kelce's head? That's only for him and future wife Taylor Swift to know.\n\nBut there's a very real chance we get a view of what Kelce is thinking in the final three weeks of the regular season.\n\nIt's not even in what he says or doesn't say. It's in what the Chiefs do.\n\nIf they play Kelce in three meaningless games to close out the season, that feels like they're letting him get a few more moments in before signing off, without concern about the future.\n\nIf the Chiefs decide to sit Kelce down the stretch, that points toward a player who is trying to preserve his health to make another go at it next season.\n\nMORE: Bills may not win the AFC East — but they sent a clear warning to the rest of the NFL\n\nOf course, Kelce himself could come out and make a proclamation one way or the other. He could also decide one thing now and change his mind in the offseason (during which he'll get married on June 13).\n\nBut keep an eye on what the Chiefs do with Kelce these last few weeks.

    "title": "Chiefs-Chargers: 5 things to watch in Week 15 contest",
    "description": "Here are the key factors in the pivotal matchup between Kansas City and Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "On Sunday, the (6-7) Kansas City Chiefs will take on the division rival (9-4) Los Angeles Chargers in an AFC West showdown on Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium. The game will kick off at noon Arrowhead Time and will be broadcast on CBS — locally on KCTV5.\n\nThis game will be a rematch of the season opener, in which the Chargers won 27-21 in São Paulo, Brazil. Los Angeles has put together a strong season since, and is currently the top Wild Card team in the AFC playoff race. The Chiefs are on the outside looking in, and this season has been a major disappointment for the defending conference champions.\n\nTemperatures at kickoff are expected to be frigid. Since 2010, the Chiefs are 5-3 against the Chargers in December at Arrowhead.\n\nLast week, left tackle Esa Pole made his NFL debut after Wanya Morris left the game early with a knee injury. Both Morris and right tackle Jawaan Taylor have been declared out for this game, so Pole is slated to start again.\n\nThis is a golden opportunity for the undrafted rookie — who turned in a solid performance in his debut — to continue to make a case for a roster spot in 2026. Morris is slated to be a free agent, while Taylor could be a cap casualty. So if he plays well enough, Pole has a chance to compete for a starting job or a shot at being the team’s new swing tackle.\n\nSimilar to the Houston Texans, Los Angeles has a solid pass rush featuring veteran outside linebacker Khalil Mack and rising star Tuli Tuipulotu off the edge. But unlike the Texans, the Chargers’ pass rush relies on power, which will give Pole a new set of obstacles to overcome. If he turns in another solid performance, it will be worth keeping him on the field through the end of the season.\n\nThird downs will be critical this week. Los Angeles’ offense converts at a 47% rate, the third-highest in the NFL, while the Chiefs rank 13th at 40%. Defensively, the Chargers allow the fourth-lowest percentage of third-down conversions (34%), while Kansas City ranks 26th at 43%.\n\nThe Chiefs’ struggles to defend third down were apparent last week. The defense allowed eight conversions over 18 attempts against Houston — and the week prior, nine of 16 third downs against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe Chiefs’ issues on third-down defense stem from the inability to create pressure in passing situations. That started in Week 1, when Los Angeles converted seven of 13 third downs.\n\nThe Chargers rank second in the NFL in time of possession per game, averaging 32:56 per game. Los Angeles excels at keeping teams off balance on early downs, while setting up manageable third downs where the powerful run game helps move the sticks.\n\nThis presents a layered problem for Kansas City’s defense that has been one of the least effective units under Chiefs’ defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.\n\nThis could be one of the lower-scoring games in the recent history of this rivalry. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, the Over/Under is listed at only 41.5 points — and the very cold weather expected on Sunday could also be a factor.\n\nBoth teams rank among the top 10 in points allowed per game: Kansas City surrenders 19.4 points per game, while the Chargers allow 20.8 points per contest.\n\nEach franchise ranks in the upper third of the league in points scored per game, but both have serious offensive line issues that could hinder the strategy. The Chiefs’ game plan in Week 14 was boosted by a backup-heavy offensive line, and Los Angeles has had its own struggles protecting quarterback Justin Herbert.\n\nTo win this game, Kansas City needs bounce-back performances from its top two pass-catchers after a horrible game in Week 14. Rice caught only four catches for 34 yards, while Kelce had one catch for eight. Both players dropped passes at key times; one resulted in a turnover on downs, and the other ended as an interception.\n\nIt was an embarrassing effort by the two players who directly contributed to the loss. The Chiefs have a higher standard for both.\n\nNeither player spoke to the media after the game; it appeared frustrations from this long season had boiled over. Leadership is desperately needed for this team right now, and it starts at the top. Anything can happen in the NFL, but if the Chiefs want to even imagine making the playoffs, then they need all-out efforts from Kelce and Rice on Sunday.\n\nDue to injuries on the Chargers’ offensive line, Herbert has been one of the most hit and pressured quarterbacks in the NFL this season. He is the third-most sacked quarterback — having taken 45 this year — and has taken the second most hits (61) on the season.\n\nThe beating has taken its toll, and Herbert is playing with a broken left hand, which has limited what the Chargers can do offensively. The Chiefs’ pass rush has struggled to generate pressure this season, but getting after Herbert will be a key to Sunday’s game.",
