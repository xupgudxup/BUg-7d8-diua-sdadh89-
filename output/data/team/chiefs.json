    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs' loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV forced an offseason change to improve the offensive line's protection of Patrick Mahomes. The adjustment was witnessed firsthand by former safety Tyrann Mathieu, who believes the same standards should apply to the New England Patriots.\n\nThe three-time Pro Bowler spoke about the situation during a recent episode of his podcast 'In the Bayou with Tyrann Mathieu'.\n\n\"New England should take sort of the Kansas City Chiefs approach. After we lost [Super Bowl LV]… the very next day, they got new offensive linemen,\" said Mathieu, \"You gotta be able to protect the product.\"\n\nTyrann Mathieu’s thoughts on the #Patriots Super Bowl loss:\n\n“New England should take sort of the Kansas City Chiefs approach. After we lost [the Super Bowl]… the very next day, they got new offensive linemen… You gotta be able to protect the product.”\n\n(🎥 @InTheBayouPod) pic.twitter.com/W8bIB1kAJE\n\n— Carlos A. Lopez (@LosTalksPats) February 16, 2026\n\nMathieu's comments echo those of many who watched the Seattle Seahawks defense dominate the Patriots' offensive line in Super Bowl LX. Left tackle Will Campbell was the target of much of the criticism, although he had an impressive season.\n\nThe Chiefs notably signed Orlando Brown Jr., Joe Thuney, and Kyle Long after Super Bowl LV to vastly improve their offensive line for the following season. New England is expected to focus on Drake Maye's protection during the offseason after he was sacked an NFL record 21 times during the 2025 postseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Tyrann Mathieu suggests Patriots learn from Chiefs' Super Bowl LV loss",

    "fullText": "Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are dealing with a lawsuit tied to the name of their Kansas City restaurant, 1587 Prime.\n\nA sneaker brand has filed a trademark infringement claim against the Chiefs teammates and their restaurant partners, asserting that the use of “1587” conflicts with its own branding.\n\nAt the center of the dispute is the shared number combination used by both businesses. The legal battle now hinges on whether the two brands can operate under similar marks in different industries.\n\nThe complaint was brought by 1587 Sneakers, which says it began selling footwear under that name on April 13, 2023.\n\nThe restaurant’s title merges Mahomes’ No. 15 and Kelce’s No. 87, a pairing the sneaker company argues it had already established in commerce.\n\nCourt records show that 1587 Prime applied for its trademark in December 2023 in the restaurant category, while 1587 Sneakers filed its application last October in the clothing category.\n\nThe sneaker brand claims that “scores of consumers” have reached out believing the two ventures are connected.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to bar the restaurant group from continuing to use the 1587 branding, halt the sale of related merchandise, and secure unspecified damages.\n\nJosh Gerben, a trademark attorney not involved in the matter, indicated the sneaker company could face challenges proving infringement.\n\nHe noted that trademarks are often allowed to coexist across separate business sectors unless consumer confusion is clearly shown.\n\n“I think it’s a tough case for the sneaker company,” Gerben said. “Trademarks can coexist in different industries. … Given that the marks are essentially identical here, is a restaurant and a shoe company too close? Are consumers likely to be confused in thinking they are affiliated with one another?”\n\nA publicist for Kelce declined to comment, and a representative for Mahomes did not respond to inquiries. The outcome will determine whether the restaurant can continue operating under its current name.\n\n‘Shut up’ – Chris Jones fires back after ESPN analyst says Chiefs should move on from Travis Kelce\n\nWhat ‘difficult’ Travis Kelce decision should Kansas City Chiefs make, reveals ESPN insider\n\nTravis Kelce hits fan again during Pebble Beach Pro-Am in third golf incident",

    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has offered a fresh update on Travis Kelce’s future, stressing that open dialogue remains the most important factor as speculation continues.\n\nThe veteran tight end has faced renewed questions about how much longer he plans to play, particularly after another demanding postseason run.\n\nReid’s latest comments suggest the situation is stable rather than urgent.\n\nPer ESPN, Reid said, “There is communication. That’s the main thing. I’ve said this before: As long as there’s communication, I’m good.\n\n“That means people want to move forward. I think that’s where Travis is.”\n\nThe Chiefs have leaned heavily on Kelce throughout their recent Super Bowl runs, with the tight end remaining Patrick Mahomes’ most trusted target in critical moments.\n\nAt 36, Kelce continues to produce at a high level, but the physical demands of the position inevitably prompt discussion about longevity.\n\nReid’s emphasis on communication indicates there is no disconnect between player and organisation. Instead, both sides appear aligned in assessing what comes next.\n\nReid added: “I’m not trying to put words in his mouth at all, and I try to give him some space here. He’s been doing this a long time, and he can sort all that out as he goes forward.\n\n“But we’re proceeding with that.”\n\nThe head coach’s tone reflects respect for a player who has become central to the franchise’s modern era.\n\nKelce’s resume includes multiple Super Bowl titles and consistent Pro Bowl selections, placing him among the most accomplished tight ends in NFL history.\n\nFor now, the message from Kansas City is clear: discussions are ongoing, and the relationship remains strong.\n\nPatrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce facing lawsuit over their Kansas City steakhouse\n\n‘Shut up’ – Chris Jones fires back after ESPN analyst says Chiefs should move on from Travis Kelce\n\nWhat ‘difficult’ Travis Kelce decision should Kansas City Chiefs make, reveals ESPN insider",

In fact, some think that around Week 6 could be a more realistic timeline.\n\nEither way, the Chiefs have to solve their roster issues, but in the meantime, they are giving their fans the chance to buy some pretty cool items that will no doubt have a lot of value attached to them.\n\nAnalyst offers Mike Evans reality that might soothe Buccaneers' worries\n\nESPN analyst thinks Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa decision has already been made\n\nTexans' Dalton Schultz offers interesting C.J.

    "description": "Tyreek Hill is now a free agent for the first time in his career.",
    "fullText": "Tyreek Hill is officially a free agent, putting him in an unfamiliar position for the first time in his career.\n\nSo, what’s next for the star wide receiver?\n\nThe Miami Dolphins officially released Hill on Monday, ending a four-season run in which the franchise bet big on him being a key piece to pair with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Ultimately, that didn’t work out. The Dolphins failed to win a single playoff game during his time in South Florida, continuing a drought that dates back to the 2000 season.\n\nHill went down with a devastating knee injury early this past season, too, including a dislocated knee. Hill’s agent said Monday that he’s “progressing well” in his rehab and will be ready to play at some point next season, and Hill vowed to return.\n\nBut who is in play for Hill next season? Yahoo Sports’ “Inside Coverage” podcast discussed a couple of possibilities Monday.\n\n\"He still has that speed. Even if he's 80% of what he was, he's still going to be one of the faster players in the NFL,\" Yahoo Sports senior betting analyst Ben Fawkes said. \"So I think he can be a useful piece for a contender, but also at what price is the big question too.\"\n\nThe first landing spot is obvious. The Chiefs are the easiest match for Hill because his career began in Kansas City, and he won a Super Bowl ring there. He appeared to give a nod of approval on social media of the Chiefs' recent re-hiring of Eric Bieniemy as offensive coordinator.\n\nBut Hill’s usage in Kansas City may not be what he’s used to.\n\n\"Is [Hill] willing to accept a lesser role if that's what he is right now? Let's say the Chiefs, right? Well, is he their No. 1 [wideout]? No, that's probably Rasheed Rice, who has his own set of baggage,” Yahoo Sports NFL senior reporter Frank Schwab said. “And is he their speed guy? Well, no, that's probably Xavier Worthy. What role is he willing to accept? How much money is he willing to accept?\"\n\nThere are, naturally, a lot of questions to be answered there. But Hill would be a solid weapon for the Chiefs, who just missed the playoffs for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nBuffalo appears hellbent on doing just about anything possible to help lift quarterback Josh Allen over the postseason hump and to a Super Bowl. That included jettisoning a successful head coach in Sean McDermott in favor of offensive coordinator Joe Brady earlier this offseason.\n\nHill could be an easy add for a team needing an extra option. Khalil Shakir was their leading receiver last year with just 719 receiving yards, while tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox were second and third.\n\n\"They need that veteran piece,\" podcast host Andrew Siciliano. \"They need that deep threat. They need a guy who down the field — I'm sorry, Brandin Cooks — can attack that football or just run away from the guy closest to him. So he doesn't have to have a contested catch there to win a playoff game in Denver.\"\n\nThe Chargers could be a great fit for Hill for multiple reasons. He’d get to pair up with Justin Herbert, who has statistically been a top tier quarterback during his first six seasons in the league even if the team has struggled at times. The Chargers have plenty of money to pay Hill, too, as they’re sitting with the third-most salary cap space in the league this offseason.\n\nOh, and Mike McDaniel is now the Chargers’ offensive coordinator after he was fired by the Dolphins earlier this offseason. Reuniting with his former head coach on the other side of the country feels like it would make things even easier for Hill coming off of his injury.\n\nSure, the Patriots reached Super Bowl LX this past season. But something was missing, and that was very evident in the final game as the Seahawks cruised to the dominant win in the Bay Area.\n\nHill could easily step into New England and help young quarterback Drake Maye as he enters his third season in the league. Pairing Hill with fellow star Stefon Diggs, who racked up 1,013 receiving yards last season, and tight end Hunter Henry, might just be the boost the team needs to get over the hump.\n\nNow this may not be Hill's first choice, considering the state of the Raiders in recent years. But there are plenty of reasons why it would work.\n\nThe Raiders are under new leadership once again this season with Klint Kubiak coming in as their head coach. The franchise has the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, too, which they will presumably use on Indiana quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza. Getting Mendoza a veteran like Hill right away in his career, along with young running back Ashton Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers, would be huge early on in his career.\n\nOh, and the Raiders have money to spend. That'd be nice for Hill, too.",

The Kelce brothers showcased their creativity for Valentine’s Day by making cheeky, punny cards. The Chiefs’ tight end made sweet references to Jumanji, his NFL career, and even Swift’s sourdough obsession. However, fans were impressed by Kelce’s witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood” in one of the creatives shared via an Instagram carousel.\n\nTravis Kelce referenced Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The New Heights podcast’s official Instagram account shared a carousel showcasing their wholesome Valentine’s Day greetings. The first slide in the carousel read, “Wood you be my Valentine?” accompanied by an animated tree and Kelce smiling.\n\nFor those who missed it, this is a reference to Swift’s raunchy track “Wood” from her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl. Notably, the global pop star has dedicated the song to her fiancé. The lyrics make a cheeky reference to Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, and his manhood as well. Swift sings, “New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood) / I ain’t gotta knock on wood” (via Page Six).\n\nFans are loving Kelce’s sweet tribute to Swift and lavished praise in the comments section. One fan commented, “Y’all had the opportunity to do the funniest thing and you did! Good job!!!” A second fan wrote, “These are too good,” accompanied by a laughing emoji. A third fan penned, “WOOD YOU BE MY VALENTINE HAHAHAHAHAH 13/13,” accompanied by clapping emojis. Finally, one fan remarked, “The wood one is my fav.”\n\nFans joked that Kelce is redeeming himself after previously not understanding a witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood.” During the Wednesday, January 21, episode of New Heights, Kelce joked that “Taylor’s gonna kill me” for missing a clear reference to Swift’s song “Wood.”\n\nThe post Travis Kelce’s Valentine’s Day Card Comes With Taylor Swift Twist appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has many players taking time away from the field to address lingering injuries, decisions, and their playing future. The Kansas City Chiefs missed the playoffs in 2025 but are still a topic of conversation off the field, especially starting quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nDuring a recent episode of 'Hot Ones Versus,' Grammy-winning artist Ciara and Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson faced off with questions and wing challenges. The rules are simple: tell the truth, or suffer the wrath of the 'Last Dab'. Whoever eats the most wings loses, and Wilson answered a tough question regarding four quarterbacks, including himself.\n\nWilson ranked Mahomes second to Tom Brady, with himself third, ahead of Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning. The former Seattle Seahawks quarterback defeated Manning's Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII. He notably chose a spicy wing rather than answering his wife's question about the worst coach he's played for in his career.\n\nThe 37-year-old's 2025 season came to an end early with the New York Giants as he was benched after the Chiefs defeated him in Week 3. Wilson lost his starting job to rookie Jaxson Dart and, for the rest of the year, served primarily as a veteran mentor. In three games started (six played), he tossed three touchdowns and three interceptions for 831 yards.\n\nWilson has been rumored recently to be a potential backup option for the Chiefs in free agency.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Russell Wilson ranks Patrick Mahomes amongst other great quarterbacks",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a disastrous 2025 season, most know where the Kansas City Chiefs' free agency shopping needs to start.\n\nKareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco are free agents, and it's unclear whether either will return in 2026; even if one does, the Chiefs need a significant upgrade.\n\nBut who? The franchise tried to trade for Breece Hall before the trade deadline, but that fell through. Now, though, there's a host of options for Breet Veach to look at.\n\nAnd ESPN's Eric Moody is tipping the Chiefs will raid fellow AFC contender, the Jacksonville Jaguars, for star back Travis Etienne.\n\n\"Running back Travis Etienne Jr. will sign with the Chiefs during free agency,\" Moody wrote. \"Etienne would be intriguing as a proven, versatile back who has surpassed 1,000 rushing yards in three of his four healthy seasons, including 1,107 yards and seven touchdowns in 2025.\n\n\"His ability to contribute as both a runner and receiver (5,136 career all-purpose yards with 32 touchdowns) would boost a Chiefs backfield that averaged less 4.0 yards per carry last season and failed to produce a running back with at least 200 receiving yards.\"\n\nMore:Ravens' Lamar Jackson tipped to join illustrious Hall of Fame group in 2026\n\nTravis has all of the attributes that neither Hunt nor Pacheco has.\n\nThe pace, speed, burst, and home run ability. Not to mention his effectiveness as a receiver, either, which will add another element to Kansas City's passing game with Patrick Mahomes back.\n\nKansas City needs someone to take the offensive load off of Patrick's shoulders, and one way to do it is with a run game, and Etienne as the lead back could give the Chiefs their fear factor back.\n\nOf course, money will be key here, but if the Chiefs are serious about turning this ship around in 2026, money will be no object, and if Etienne is available, they'll go get him.\n\nAre Chiefs disrespected in latest power rankings?\n\nThree-time Pro Bowler makes plea for Lions stay to 59 TD star\n\nChargers' hire named one of the best upgrades of the offseason\n\nBears named big winners of 2025 draft class\n\nFormer Steelers player goes scorched earth on Ben Roethlisberger\n\nBills know how to fix Keon Coleman claims ESPN analyst\n\nCommanders get outlandish 2026 prediction from ESPN",

After attempting CPR, it was determined she was deceased.\n\n“Due to the condition of the victim and the residence, HCSO Criminal Investigative Services Detectives responded. Preliminary findings indicate the victim’s death was the result of a homicide,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.\n\n“The victim’s boyfriend, Darron Lee, was identified as the suspect and taken into custody at the scene.”\n\nLee, who played for the Chiefs in 2019, has been charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence. Lee was in 16 games that season, but he didn’t appear in the playoffs as the Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV.\n\nAccording to WRCB-TV in Chattanooga, “Lee told (first responders) that he had found her unconscious on the couch, and thought that she had perhaps fallen in the shower, but his statements didn’t line up with the ‘concerning conditions’ within the home, the arrest report says.\n\n“Deputies with the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office say they found blood spatter on the walls and flooring in multiple locations, as well as broken glass scattered across the kitchen area. They also observed cleaning materials in ‘abnormal places.’”\n\nThe WRCB story said a medical examiner found the victim had a stab wound to the abdomen as well as a bruise on her head and other injuries.\n\nThe New York Post reported Lee is being held without bond and has a court date set for Wednesday.",

He has established a growing career in entertainment, catching the attention of many in the business.\n\nDuring a recent podcast co-hosted by ESPN's Mina Kimes and David Dennis Jr., which discussed entertainment and pop culture, they sat down with comedian and Traitors reality-show contestant Ron Funches. He discussed working on the show alongside Donna Kelce and first meeting Travis while he was hosting the game show \"Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity\".\n\nFunches, who served as one of the celebrity panelists on the show, offered high praise for the eleven-time Pro Bowler.\n\n\"An amazing game show host,\" said Funches. \"Never met this man in my life, and was honestly like, 'All right, football guy, you gonna come in here and host this show? The thing that I want to do? I want to host this show.

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs have always been the biggest thorn in the Buffalo Bills’ path when it comes to the Super Bowl. In fact, Josh Allen has lost four different contests against Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs over the years. That’s why, when those same Chiefs missed the playoffs this year, it should have been good news for the Bills’ locker room. Except it wasn’t.\n\nAccording to Allen, the team never focused on the Chiefs’ exclusion from the playoffs. It went against what many football fans were thinking at the time when Buffalo reached the postseason with a dominant run no less. Many believed that the absence of Mahomes was another significant advantage for the team.\n\n“That’s something that we don’t talk about in the locker room, really. We don’t really care so much about who else is in the playoffs with us, how to get there, or how to get it done. The short answer is we didn’t get it done this year. And that’s on us, that’s on me,” Allen saidduring his appearance on First Things First.\n\nIt’s surprising to hear, to say the least. After all, Allen has lost to Mahomes by one score in the playoffs three times. Last season, less than one yard decided the outcome of the game.\n\nLater on, Allen shed some light on his mentality going into this postseason.\n\n“We’re going to keep working tirelessly until we find a way to get there and get it done. I understand the people’s thoughts of you don’t have no Mahomes, no Lamar, no Joe Burrow in the playoffs. But there’s some dang good teams in this playoffs. They’re not there just by chance. They’re there for a reason. And the two teams that are in the Super Bowl, they deserve to be there,” Allen stated.\n\nSome may see it as an excuse from the former MVP, but Allen is right. There were a few teams better than the Chiefs in the AFC this season. Even the Jacksonville Jaguars went on a run, giving the Bills a tough test in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe Denver Broncos ultimately ended up being the team to send Allen home this time around. They had an elite defense and were playing with home-field advantage. Allen turned the ball over four times in that game, including a pivotal overtime interception. It went down as another heartbreaking playoff loss in Bills history.\n\nMaybe one of these years, Allen and the Bills will get over the hump. At this point in his career, a Super Bowl win is a massive monkey the QB can’t seem to get off his back. It does, however, sound like he will always stay motivated to win one because of his love for the game. Still, the lack of a Lombardi Trophy in his hands must be starting to wear on him.\n\nThe post Bills News: Josh Allen Says Locker Room ‘Didn’t Really Care’ About Chiefs Missing the Playoffs appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs missed the playoffs this past season, finishing with a 6-11 record—the first time that has happened since 2014. Coming off their first six-win campaign since 2012, some big changes are expected from Kansas City this offseason.\n\nNate Taylor of ESPN wrote that the Chiefs are “expected” to move on from Isiah Pacheco this offseason and bring in a new starting running back. After being hired as offensive coordinator, Eric Bieniemy “will be tasked with putting together the correct run-blocking scheme” for the club.\n\nIt is a relatively easy decision for the Chiefs coaching staff and front office to make. Kansas City finished the regular season ranked 20th in yards per carry average (4.2) and 25th in rushing (106.6 yards per game). Furthermore, both NFL free agency and the 2026 NFL Draft are deep at running back.\n\nOn the open market, Breece Hall, Kenneth Walker III, Travis Etienne Jr., and Javonte Williams will be available as quality starters. If the organization prefers to find a rotational back to pair with a rookie, it could sign someone like Rachaad White, Rico Dowdle, or Kenneth Gainwell.\n\nSome have theorized that the Chiefs could use their first-round pick on All-American running back Jeremiyah Love. He is an All-Pro caliber talent who some believe is one of the top running back prospects to enter the NFL since Saquon Barkley. However, it is unlikely that general manager Brett Veach would use the ninth-overall pick on a running back.\n\nMore likely, Kansas City will sign one of the top veteran running backs in free agency and then use a mid-round pick on another ball carrier. While it might not offer as much upside as drafting Love, it could still be a very effective way to improve the Chiefs’ rushing attack.\n\n5 NY Giants Co-Owner Replacements After Tisch Named in Epstein Files, Including Steve Cohen\n\nNFL Reporter Seemingly Reveals How Close Bill Belichick Came to HOF Induction\n\nWild Stat Suggests NY Jets Fans Better Than Their NY Giants Counterparts",

    "description": "Kansas City Chiefs fans need to check out some of the best defensive linemen from the Senior Bowl before the 2026 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs need to add depth, and maybe even a starter, along their defensive line in the 2026 NFL Draft. Fortunately, some of the best trench players in the class recently came together to compete in Mobile, Ala. for the Senior Bowl. Several prospects stood out as potential targets for the Chiefs.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, George Karlaftis was the only Kansas City edge rusher to amass 35 or more pressures in 2025. For reference, 59 edge rushers across the entire NFL reached that threshold. Within the AFC West, a duo of Denver Broncos, three Las Vegas Raiders and three Los Angeles Chargers accomplished the feat. Only the Chiefs lagged behind.\n\nFuture Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive tackle Chris Jones helps the Chiefs keep their noses above water in the pass rush, but he offers limited value in run defense at this stage of his career. Jones turns 32 years old before the start of the 2026 season.\n\nThe Chiefs need to add immediate production on the edge while also considering the long-term future of their interior defensive line. The Senior Bowl features enough star prospects to satisfy both needs, if the Chiefs hit on their selections.\n\nWhen the 2026 Panini Senior Bowl kicks off at 1:30 p.m. CT today on NFL Network, Chiefs fans should keep an eye out for these five star defensive linemen.\n\nHeight is undersized at 6’2 3/8”, 234 lbs. with 32 3/4” arms. Those measurements didn’t stop him from dominating opposing offensive tackles during the team periods. He beat Dametrious Crownover with an outside jab into a B-gap swim and reached the quarterback in just 2.1 seconds on Wednesday. Height’s speed rush is very effective and sets up his twitchy inside counters.\n\nHeight suffered several clean losses. He struggles to win when offensive tackles get into his pads early in the play, and his limited mass makes it difficult to survive heavy punches. Height projects best as a rotational edge rusher who could develop into a full-time starter, similar to Alex Highsmith’s path on the Steelers.\n\nJacas, Kyle Louis and Zion Young stood at the pinnacle of performance throughout the Senior Bowl practices. At 6’3 1/8”, 260 lbs. with 32 3/4” arms, Jacas is a stout, sawed-off rusher capable of driving through the offensive tackle’s frame with power, winning around the corner with technical savvy or reducing inside to challenge guards.\n\nJacas won at the Senior Bowl with an outside speed rush, speed-to-power conversion, chop-rip combinations and swims through the B-gap. His explosiveness off the line of scrimmage led to several instantaneous wins.\n\nJacas fits the archetype of edge rusher Kansas City values. He entered the week with mixed grades. Now, it seems inconceivable that he goes anywhere later than the early third round.\n\nBanks missed most of his final season with injuries and started off on the wrong foot in Mobile. His first day or practice was a wash, but he dominated across the final two sessions. At 6’6”, 335 lbs. with 35” arms and 10 3/4” hands, Banks is a behemoth capable of pushing the pocket or applying clean pressure by discarding guards with his violent hands.\n\nCaleb Banks gets a win on Auburn’s Jeremiah Wright, and he’s feeling pretty good about it. #thedraftstartsinmobile #seniorbowl #nfldraft pic.twitter.com/qIbxVFIQXi\n\n— Sam Teets (@Sam_Teets33) January 29, 2026\n\nBanks displays rare foot quickness and agility early in plays, especially for a defender his size. His pad level becomes a limiting factor late in games, but the tradeoff seems worth it for teams hoping to add more muscle to their defensive front.\n\nHunter is a physical freak in his own right. He’s 6’3 1/2”, 320 lbs. with 34 1/4” arms. His rare explosiveness helps him drive vertically on pass plays, but he also possesses the quickness and lateral agility to exchange gaps or sidestep and play around blockers.\n\nLee Hunter is a top 50 player for me. 330-lb NT with heavy hands and a very quick first step for his size. Comfortably the most detailed and instinctive pass rusher in the '26 NT class pic.twitter.com/NC3o1WNdu9\n\n— James Foster (@NoFlagsFilm) December 10, 2025\n\nHunter’s stout anchor and long arms make it easy for him to stack, peek and shed blockers in the run game. Displacing him at the point of attack is a challenging task. Hunter resets the line of scrimmage by driving blockers into the backfield and finishes big plays with his closing burst.\n\nHunter’s skill set and playstyle make him the perfect complement to Chris Jones. The Texas Tech product should rank near the top of Kansas City’s draft board.\n\nYoung ranked among the top performers at the Senior Bowl. He is a dense and powerful edge rusher at 6’5 1/4”, 262 lbs. with 33 1/2” arms. Throughout the week, he displayed the power to push the pocket and soften angles before finishing his rushes with counters.\n\nThe power that Missouri’s Zion Young has shown at the Senior Bowl is terrifying. You don’t want to see him lining up across from you in a four-point stance with those bent elbows. pic.twitter.com/qCksPcbCZh\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) January 29, 2026\n\nYoung sent Jude Bowry tumbling in a one-on-one rep and folded J.C. Davis in one of the most dominant displays of power all week. Young primarily relies on winning through the offensive lineman’s frame or countering into or prying open the B-gap because of his lack of bend. However, his long strides help him push upfield quickly and led to some clean wins in the team periods.\n\nYoung’s arm length, play strength and anchor also make him an effective edge-setter in the run game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs NFL Draft: Watch these 5 Senior Bowl defensive linemen",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKayla Nicole found herself back in the middle of online discourse this week after a seemingly minor social media interaction sparked major reaction from fans.\n\nThe former girlfriend of Travis Kelce was flooded with criticism after screenshots circulated showing she had liked a recent Instagram post involving the Kansas City Chiefs star. The post, shared by Bleacher Report, highlighted Travis and his brother Jason Kelce helping fund U.S. hockey player Laila Edwards’ family trip to Milan for her Winter Olympics debut.\n\nMORE: Cardi B will be the musical guest on 'SNL'\n\nThe caption praised the Kelce brothers’ generosity, calling them “two great guys that went out of their way when they didn’t have to.” While the story itself focused on the charitable gesture, attention quickly shifted to Nicole after users noticed her verified account had interacted with the post.\n\nThat single “like” was enough to set off a wave of backlash, particularly from fans protective of Travis’ current relationship with Taylor Swift. Screenshots of the interaction spread rapidly across platforms, and commentary soon followed. One user accused Nicole of chasing attention, writing that she “really dislikes not being talked about.” Another questioned why the moment was being amplified at all, arguing that continued focus only fuels unnecessary drama.\n\nThe reaction added to a growing list of moments that have kept Nicole in headlines since her 2022 breakup with Travis. Last year, fans speculated about possible shade when she recreated Toni Braxton’s “He Wasn’t Man Enough” look from the early 2000s music video, and other posts have also been interpreted — fairly or not — as indirect jabs at Swift.\n\nWhile Nicole has not publicly addressed the latest situation, the renewed attention arrives as the Kelce family continues to dominate headlines for entirely different reasons.\n\nMORE: Austin Reaves' YoungLA fashion drop gets love from Luka Doncic and Lebron James\n\nTravis’ mother, Donna Kelce, recently raised eyebrows during promotional interviews ahead of her appearance on The Traitors. When asked who she hoped to avoid encountering on the show, Donna listed rivals, coaches, and then added one more category.\n\n“Maybe some of my sons’ adversaries,” she said. “That could either be on other teams, or it could be coaches, or it could be past girlfriends.”",

    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

    "title": "Chiefs’ Andy Reid is ‘fired up’ about new staff: ‘Change can be good’",
    "description": "Kansas City’s head coach is optimistic about the coaching shakeup.",
    "fullText": "For the first time in eight years, the Kansas City Chiefs were not involved in Sunday’s NFL doubleheader of conference championships. Head coach Andy Reid has been a staple of both the AFC and NFC title games throughout his career, so with his 2025 team unable to even make the postseason, a change around him was not a surprising result.\n\nThe offensive coordinator spot has officially been turned over to Eric Bienemy, despite former coordinator Matt Nagy still searching for his next job. In total, five positions on the offensive coaching staff have been vacated since the end of last season. So far, the only official hire is Bienemy, but Reid made it clear he’s excited about the new chapter during a Zoom call with local media on Monday.\n\nAndy's got great energy in this presser. Good to see him so lively. He's ready to get back to work\n\n— Ron Kopp Jr (@RonOnChiefs) January 26, 2026\n\nAfter a few spirited answers, Reid was asked about the noticeable energy in his words.\n\n“I’m fired up to get in this offseason and get going,” Reid responded. “We didn’t do very well this past year, and that has not been our MO here. So I want to fix the problems we had in all phases. There will be people that move on, people that come in… change can be good sometimes for you, so that’s what I’m fired up about.”\n\nSome will point at Bieniemy’s history with Reid and Kansas City as hardly a “change,” but his style is objectively different than Nagy’s. Reid acknowledged that and emphasized how Bieniemy straightforwardly communicates with players and coaches, including star quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\n“I’d tell you EB will be very direct with him,” Reid shared. “[Mahomes] knows it’s coming from a place of knowledge there.”\n\nStill, there will be criticism that the change needed was in reference to his offensive scheme. Reid would agree that it needs a refresh — or a retooling, as he foreshadowed in December — so that’s what he hopes the newest hires help with.\n\n“Everywhere you go in this business, you pick something up,” Reid explained. “You might take it with you, or you might say, ‘I don’t want to do that.‘”\n\n“I welcome that, I always keep my ears and eyes open for things,” Reid assured. “That’s why we’re very seldom stagnant, and why, even with our record, I felt I could stand in front of you guys and go ‘listen, what worked for us the year before, it just flipped on us.’ That’s sometimes how this thing works, so now it’s making sure we get back and do the right things, correct some things, and then get them going in the right direction again.”\n\nIn the modern age of accessible information, Reid reminded those listening that new ideas can be introduced without further hiring. It just takes effort and willingness.\n\n“You use all the technology that’s out there,” Reid pointed out. “There is no reason to be stagnant; you have too many different options, you shouldn’t have to bring in the latest, greatest here and there, all that. You have all that right at a finger tip for you, if you go that route.”\n\nThere will likely be little change in the chain of command for calling a play into Mahomes, but that’s because it is already a collaborative process. The positive change will simply be the new voices.\n\n“I still enjoy calling plays,” Reid admitted. “But what I do, I’m also not afraid to delegate and get opinions from people. Even in certain situations, letting them go ahead and call things in different areas. We do this jointly. I keep it open, and I’ve felt that’s the best way. I want guys to contribute, I want them to work hard and be experts in their area, and then accumulate in all areas. I’ve always mixed and matched there, and it seemed to have been fairly productive.”\n\nThe change is welcomed by many in Kansas City. The head coach’s enthusiasm and upbeat energy when talking about the transition prove that it is already reinvigorating the people it needs to.",

I was, like, 'What are you talking about? My family owns the Bills. This team has owned us in the post-season'.\n\n“All she has to do is eat a piece of pie. What is the big deal? I think that was really some extra motivation, because that would have been a tough moment for me.”\n\nPegula said the apple pie topped with cheddar cheese was her family's Thanksgiving tradition.\n\n\"A bet is a bet, so I'll do it,\" said Keys. \"I hope it's less gross than I think it's going to be, but we will find out, I guess.\"\n\nKeys, meanwhile, is set to drop out of the world’s top 10 after her fourth-round exit but said she was proud of how she had handle the experience of returning as defending champion.\n\n“It's obviously not the way that I wanted things to end here, but I'm still really proud of myself,” Keys said\n\n“I think coming back, being defending champion, dealing with all of the extra pressure and nerves, I'm just really proud of myself for how I handled it.\n\n“Just one of those days where I feel like Jess beat me, and I can kind of walk away with my head held high.”\n\nPegula is bidding to win her first grand slam title, having coming closest at the US Open with an appearance in the final and semi-finals in the last two seasons.\n\nBut she is yet to drop a set so far and will be confident when she meets another US Open runner-up in Anisimova, who is bidding to win her first grand slam title after defeats in the finals of Wimbledon and the US Open last season.\n\n“I'm just really happy that the work that I've done with my coaches,” Pegula said. “I really believe in that and what we have done, and to be able to kind of execute that stuff in a grand slam, second tournament of the year for me, will give me a lot of confidence, not just here but just going into the year.\n\n“I have always been the type of player where I get frustrated when I feel like I'm not getting better. And I still think that at my age, I've already had a lot of really great results. Being 31, I still feel like I'm improving as a player. So that is what gets me the most excited.”",

Head coach Andy Reid continues to readjust his staff after recently parting ways with long-time associate Todd Pinkson.\n\nAccording to the Kansas City Star's Sam McDowell, Pinkston was let go after being hired by the team in 2023. The former wide receiver under Reid with the Philadelphia Eagles won a Super Bowl title with the Chiefs in his first season on the staff.\n\nThere are four changes to the Chiefs coaching staff so far, per sources:\n\nThey have fired RBs coach Todd Pinkston and WRs coach Connor Embree.\n\nLouie Addazio chose to move on for the OL job at UNLV. Alex Whittingham has joined the Michigan staff.\n\nCould be more after the carousel…\n\n— Sam McDowell (@SamMcDowell11) January 15, 2026\n\nThe Chiefs have already parted ways with wide receiver coach Conner Embree and will be welcoming Eric Bieniemy as their new offensive coordinator. Pinkston's history with Reid dates back to his playing days, showing his loyalty to the system and signaling drastic changes after a disappointing 2025 season.\n\nKansas City's running game lacked explosion all season due to injuries, and big plays were rare from the position. Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco led the team in rushing, with Hunt finishing with 611 yards and Pacheco with 462 yards. Rookie running back Brashard Smith contributed with 151 yards on the ground but proved to be a versatile threat in the passing game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kansas City Chiefs part ways with longtime Andy Reid associate",

    "description": "The future of the Kansas City Chiefs’ new home stadium is in jeopardy after a recent committee meeting involving Kansas lawmakers. The Chiefs announced plans for a new $3 billion domed stadium in December, where they proposed public ownership of the arena, as a significant percentage of the funding would be secured through sales tax revenue (STAR) bonds.",
    "fullText": "The future of the Kansas City Chiefs’ new home stadium is in jeopardy after a recent committee meeting involving Kansas lawmakers. The Chiefs announced plans for a new $3 billion domed stadium in December, where they proposed public ownership of the arena, as a significant percentage of the funding would be secured through sales tax revenue (STAR) bonds.\n\nHence, when questions were raised about why the stadium wasn’t privately owned, Chiefs attorney Korb Maxwell issued a statement confirming that, without public ownership, the proposal wouldn’t make sense for the franchise.\n\n“If that (stadium) is not owned by a sports authority, if that is owned in private hands, then, if you would have $1.8 billion of STAR bonds come into that development, that would all be federally income taxed,” Maxwell said, as per the Kansas City Business Journal. “And so you would take, then, 45% of the dollars that came in and roughly ship that to Washington, D.C. … That would blow a huge hole in the budget for this project and, frankly, would not allow it to move forward.”\n\nAs explained by Korb Maxwell, private ownership would entail that the $1.8 billion in sales tax revenue (STAR) bonds could not be issued for the Chiefs’ stadium on a tax-exempt basis. This would lead to a massive hit on the franchise’s budget for the stadium and, hence, would push the Chiefs to move away from their proposed plan.\n\nThese questions about public ownership of the stadium stem from the possibility of what would happen if the Kansas City Chiefs, who will be taking care of the arena, decide to leave. Responding to these concerns, the Chiefs’ attorney reiterated the franchise’s long-term plans for the stadium.\n\n“We’re absolutely doing this and planning this as the long, long-term home for the Kansas City Chiefs for (multiple) generations,” Maxwell said, as per theKansas City Business Journal.\n\nWith this statement, the Chiefs seem adamant about securing public ownership for their new stadium, as they believe this venture will be prosperous for the state of Kansas.\n\nAs plans for the new Kansas City Chiefs stadium were unveiled, team owner Clark Hunt shared why this decision to move from Arrowhead was taken. In his statement, Hunt explained how this new project will significantly benefit the fans and the state of Kansas.\n\n“We made a decision as a family that this was the right opportunity and the best for the organization for several reasons,” Hunt said. “It’s about the fans. My dad [Lamar Hunt, who founded the franchise] was always about the fans and thinking about the future.”\n\n“This will give Chiefs Kingdom a state-of-the-art facility for multiple generations, a building that can last for at least 50 or 60 years. We believe it’s the best thing for the region. It will give Kansas City the opportunity to bid on events that we can’t host right now, like the Super Bowl, the College Football Playoff, and the NCAA Final Fours.”\n\nAs the Chiefs navigate the complex financing structure for their proposed $3 billion domed stadium, the franchise’s commitment to public ownership appears non-negotiable due to federal tax implications. Whether Kansas lawmakers will approve the necessary STAR bonds remains to be seen, but the Hunt family has made clear its vision extends generations into the future.\n\nThe post Chiefs Threaten Kansas Exit Over $3 Billion Dispute as Clark Hunt & Ownership Demand a ‘Landlord’ for New Stadium appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Titans opt for another candidate, keeping Nagy in Kansas City amidst offensive struggles and potential Mahomes absence.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs won’t need to go looking for another offensive coordinator, at least for now, as current OC Matt Nagy lost out to Robert Salah to become the next head coach of the Tennessee Titans on Tuesday.\n\nNagy interviewed with the Titans over a week ago, causing many rumors of a departure to Tennessee that’d force the Chiefs to find a new OC in 2026. Perhaps that wouldn’t be the worst outcome for Kansas City, however, as the last couple of seasons haven’t been great in Kansas City on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nWe've completed in-person interviews with the following candidates. pic.twitter.com/Mctvgl2U5K\n\n— Tennessee Titans (@Titans) January 20, 2026\n\nThere was no sign of the same dominant offense in Kansas City this past season. The Chiefs finished the season with 320.6 yards per game, only enough for 20th in the NFL. It’s only the second time the Chiefs haven't finished with at least 350 yards per game since Mahomes took over at QB.\n\nIt becomes even more alarming with the fact that the other season under 350 yards per game was in 2024, meaning the offense hasn’t been great in Kansas City for two consecutive seasons now. There’s no denying that the Chiefs, despite their dominance in the early 2020s, no longer instill the same fear into opponents from the offensive side of the ball.\n\nIt’s unfair to say the offensive troubles last season were entirely the fault of Nagy, however. In 2025, injuries and suspensions played a big role in the Chiefs’ failures. It’s why Nagy has garnered a lot of interest this offseason as a name to fill the head coaching vacancies around the league.\n\nNagy has been with the Chiefs for several years, first starting with the team back in 2013. After his stint as the head coach for the Bears, Nagy immediately returned to Kansas City, playing a role in its last three Super Bowl appearances.\n\nIt looks like he’ll be returning once again in 2026 despite the interest from the Titans, who ultimately chose Salejh, the defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. With Mahomes likely out for at least a portion of the 2026 season and several other question marks surrounding the offense, Nagy will certainly have his hands full come fall. In an offseason where there are looking to be several huge changes to the team, the Chiefs being able to keep Nagy will come as a breath of fresh air for the front office.",

    "description": "The Kansas City backfield stands to benefit from Bieniemy’s return.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs are reuniting with former offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy after a disappointing 2025 season that resulted in a major shakeup in the coaching staff.\n\nBieniemy’s 2025 season was the opposite: he was hired to coach the running backs for the Chicago Bears and first-year head coach Ben Johnson, who was the hottest name among offensive-minded candidates in last year’s coaching carousel. Chicago won the NFC North and beat the division-rival Green Bay Packers in the playoffs by leaning heavily on a top-10 offense.\n\nWhile quarterback Caleb Williams proved capable of leading a high-powered unit, it was the rushing attack that drove the offense to be one of the NFL’s best. As a team, the Bears averaged the third-most rushing yards per attempt (4.9). Lead running back D’Andre Swift set a career high in rushing yards (1,087) and touchdowns (9).\n\nHowever, the performance of rookie running back Kyle Monangai — a seventh-round pick — was the strongest example of Bieniemy’s influence. The downhill runner racked up 783 rushing yards in the regular season, averaging less than 10 attempts per game. He finished with the 24th-most rushing yards in the NFL, and the fifth-most among a productive class of backs.\n\nHis first breakout game was in Week 7, when he averaged 6.2 yards per carry and scored over 13 attempts. In the wake of that win, Monangai explained that Bieniemy’s coaching style resonated with him.\n\n“I don’t try to see how I would fit a coach’s coach style. I kind of just receive the coach and how it’s taken,” Monangai said. “It just so happens the way he coaches is how I’ve been coached my whole life. Guys  that demand a lot of you and maybe be a little vocal, as you guys get to hear on a daily basis. But yeah, he coaches as hard, he demands a lot out of us, but he does it because he knows we can do it. I think I respond to the way he coaches, and I just take everything he does and try to apply to my game and execute.”\n\nIn that same week, Monangai shared a coaching point from Bieniemy that hit home and was emphasized to all of the Chicago backfield.\n\n“You’ll hear E.B. say all the time, ‘Find four and a half’ (yards per carry). He’s not too concerned with everything number-wise or big picture. He just says whatever play we’re on is the most important, and if the ball’s in your hand, you’ve got to find four and a half.”\n\nTwo weeks later, the rookie gashed the Cincinnati Bengals for 176 yards over 24 carries. A month after that, Monangai ran for 130 yards to help topple the Philadelphia Eagles on the road.\n\nSince the upstart rookie played collegiately at Rutgers, the easy comparison has been the former seventh-round pick and starting running back of the Chiefs, Isiah Pacheco. However, Bieniemy pointed to another back in Kansas City when asked for a comparison.\n\n“When I first had an opportunity to watch Kyle, he reminded me of someone, not myself,” Bieniemy said. “Reminds me of Kareem Hunt, and watching him and studying him on tape, going back to my days of reviewing tape on Kareem, those two are very, very similar. That’s the person that I see. Now, he has a lot to live up to because Kareem has had an outstanding career, but the kid takes a tremendous amount of pride in the little things, so that’s important. Now we just got to continue to grow.”\n\nHunt was a third-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, leading the NFL in rushing as a rookie with Bieniemy as his position coach.\n\nWith Bieniemy now focusing on getting the most out of the Chiefs’ backfield, Monangai’s rookie rushing total puts the offense’s subpar 2025 season into perspective: 783 rushing yards — the second-most on the Bears — would have led Kansas City in each of the last two years.\n\nThere is plenty of hands-on coaching needed across the Chiefs’ offense for the coordinator. However, the run game needs to be especially sharpened. The scheme and playcalling factor into that improvement, but Bieniemy’s ability to get the most out of an individual may factor in as well. Monangai responded to his coaching by dramatically outplaying his 233rd overall selection.",

    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes continues to rehab after surgery on his knee. He spoke with reporters recently, discussing the importance of his relationship with Assistant Athletic Trainer Julie Frymyer when dealing with the injury.\n\n“I think it’s extremely important because what I’ve found out throughout this process is not every day is going to feel amazing,” said Mahomes, “There’s some days you’re going to be sore or some days you’re going to feel stiff, but you have to have someone you trust that’s going to get the best out of you, that’s going to keep you safeand someone that’s going to push you more than anything. Some days I want to go in there and crush rehab (and) some days I just want to get through it, but she (Assistant Athletic Trainer Julie Frymyer) doesn’t let you have the get through it days.”\n\nMahomes has shown trust in Frymyer off the field, as she co-starred with him in a recent State Farm commercial alongside singer Meghan Trainor.\n\n“She pushes you to be the best every single day. It’s been a different process, kind of jumping right into working out like this,” said Mahomes, “I always worked out, built up throughout the offseason, but it’s been fun to be with people that care about me, and that want to push me to be the best that I can be. I’m in that training room every single day, and I’m trying to make sure that I’m ready to go as quickly as possible.”\n\nKansas City’s medical staff will be hard at work this offseason to get the franchise quarterback up and running ahead of the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Patrick Mahomes discusses strong trust in the Chiefs’ training staff",

I thought we had great discipline, we went the tough route and didn't go for any cheap fixes.\n\n\"You've got to look at how hard the forwards and backs worked and the quality of the set-piece was the foundation of it, turning over lineouts and that kind of stuff.\n\n\"I thought we were fantastic with our territory, our kicking game and credit to the forwards with the mauls, the pick and go stuff. We were on it in that first half, that's for sure.\n\n\"Cardiff got a foot in the game but we always stayed in the fight, never gave up on anything and came back with a nice bonus point try, then to get another try at the end was excellent.\"\n\nExeter: Woodburn; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Haydon-Wood, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Varney; Sio, Dweba, Tchumbadze, Jenkins, Zambonin, Hooper, E Roots, James.\n\nReplacements: Heaven, Goodrick-Clarke, J Roots, Tuima, Pearson, Capstick, Chapman, Hammersley.\n\nCardiff: Beetham; Grady, Smit, Jennings, Bowen; I Lloyd, Mulder; Southworth, E Lloyd, Wainwright, McNally, Thornton, Botham, Thomas, Basham.\n\nReplacements: Hughes, Domachowski, Sebastian, Nott, Lawrence, Cottle, Davies, Winnett.",

    "fullText": "Patrick Mahomes makes feelings about Matt Nagy perfectly clear originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are in rare territory.\n\nFor the first time in over a decade, the team did not make the playoffs. Star quarterback Patrick Mahomes also went down with a season-ending injury and the Chiefs ended up going 6-11.\n\nThat lack of success hasn't made teams any less interested in the team's assistants, though. Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo have both received head coach interest from teams in this cycle.\n\nNagy, in particular, appears likely to land a new gig. If the coach leaves, the Chiefs will have to find a new offensive coordinator for the first time since 2023.\n\nRecently, Mahomes was asked about Nagy and the quarterback gave a glowing review.\n\n\"I love Coach Nagy... He gave me a lot of ideas to be better as a person and as a quarterback... Wishing him the best throughout this head-coaching process,\" Mahomes said on Thursday.\n\nIf one of the best quarterbacks of all time likes you as a coach, you're probably doing something right. Mahomes played under Nagy in 2017 during the coach's first tenure in Kansas City, so there's plenty of familiarity between the two.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024 under Nagy, the Chiefs' offense was in the top half of the league in both points scored and total yards. The unit took a step back in 2025, finishing 20th in yards and 21st in points.\n\nHowever, the team as a whole regressed, and the offense dealt with some very bad quarterback play after Mahomes went down. Before the injury, Mahomes threw for 3,587 yards with 22 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.\n\nNagy is now looking for his second chance as a head coach. The first time around, Nagy coached the Chicago Bears from 2018-21 and compiled a 34-31 record. The longtime coach has been with the Chiefs since being fired by the Bears.\n\nSo far, Nagy has been reported to have interviewed with the Tennessee Titans, Baltimore Ravens, Las Vegas Raiders, and Arizona Cardinals for their head coaching vacancies. Notably, Nagy is familiar with Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi, as the two were together with the Chiefs.\n\nMike McDaniel could be headed to the AFC North\n\nRobert Griffin III roasts Browns after disastrous season\n\nDid the Dolphins fire McDaniel because of Harbaugh?\n\nFalcons listed as top landing spot for elite head coach\n\nAre the Cardinals the worst HC job in the NFL?\n\nPete Carroll could be replaced by elite college coach",

    "fullText": "During Tuesday's episode of \"Up & Adams,\" hosted by Kay Adams, former Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith discussed Kansas City's coaching changes. After Adams mentioned that the former top overall pick's name was a potential replacement for offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, he immediately took himself out of the running.\n\n\"No way,\" Smith said with a smile. \"No. It's so hard, my kids. I got 14, 12, 9. You take that job, it's like 'see you in five years.' You know, it's hard, I love Matt (Nagy), that's my guy, I love Matt, but no.\"\n\nAlex Smith shuts the door on taking the Chiefs OC job with reports that Matt Nagy is \"expected to leave\"...\n\nAnd looks for Andy Reid to bring in familiar face Mike Kafka 👀@heykayadams pic.twitter.com/6H1yq6Tbg9\n\n— Up & Adams (@UpAndAdamsShow) January 13, 2026\n\nSmith shared some insight into how head coach Andy Reid handles his coaching staff.\n\n\"Andy (Reid) just rarely brings somebody out of his circle, said Smith. \"I don't think it's a bad thing if he did, but i think in some ways (Mike) Kafka fits that so perfectly, he just spent four or five years with (Brian) Daboll in that system, but obviously he knows that Chiefs system so well, i think he can bring in some outside ideas.\"\n\nKafka spent the last few seasons as the offensive coordinator for the New York Giants, but finished 2025 as the interim head coach after Daboll was fired mid-season. Smith also reminded the public how play-calling duties are handled on Reid's coaching staff.\n\n\"Andy is doing the offense we all know that, and Andy knows it,\" said Smith, \"When you're the offensive coordinator, you only have so much input.\"\n\nThe Chiefs will likely be looking to part ways with Nagy, as he's been a hot name in interviews with multiple teams in recent days.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Former Chiefs QB Alex Smith addresses possible OC job candidacy",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans interviewed Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator and former Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo for their open head coach position.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans conducted an interview with Steve Spagnuolo for their head coaching vacancy. Here's everything you need to know about the Titans' coaching candidate.\n\nSpagnuolo, 66, has been the Kansas City Chiefs’ defensive coordinator since 2019 and is a four-time Super Bowl champion as a coordinator. He previously served as head coach of the St. Louis Rams from 2009-11 and spent four games as interim head coach with the New York Giants in 2017. Across those four seasons, Spagnuolo posted an 11-41 record. Among coaches who’ve coached at least 50 games in the Super Bowl era, Spagnuolo’s winning percentage is the second worst, ahead of only Hue Jackson.\n\nSpagnuolo has worked with Chiefs coach Andy Reid during Reid’s tenures in Philadelphia and Kansas City. He also worked with Tom Coughlin in New York as the Giants’ defensive coordinator in 2007-08, helping the Giants to a Super Bowl win, before heading to St. Louis for his first head coaching job.\n\nSpagnuolo’s tenure in St. Louis was one of the more disastrous runs for any franchise in recent memory. The Rams went 1-15 in Spagnuolo’s first season, earning the No. 1 pick in the ensuing No. 1 draft that was used on quarterback Sam Bradford. Bradford helped turn things around for the Rams as a rookie, posting a 7-9 record. But the Rams’ fates cratered the next year. Bradford and the offense only scored 193 points all season, the fifth-worst mark of the 21st century and, to this day, the last time an NFL team scored fewer than 200 points across a full season. Spagnuolo’s defense didn’t fare all that much better, allowing the seventh-most points in the NFL and putting up a putrid performance against the run to push the squad to a 2-14 finish and Spagnuolo to his firing.\n\nSpagnuolo bounced around roles with New Orleans, Baltimore and the Giants over the next half-decade before returning to Reid’s orbit at the start of the Chiefs’ dynasty. Under Spagnuolo’s tutelage, Chiefs defenders like Chris Jones, Tyrann Mathieu and Trent McDuffie have earned first-team All-Pro nods, while contributors such as Nick Bolton, Frank Clark and Justin Reid playing at or around the peaks of their positions at various times.\n\nThough Reid’s offense gets a lot of credit for the Chiefs’ Super Bowl wins, Spagnuolo’s defense has been the propulsive force of their last couple of runs. This was especially true in 2023 when the Chiefs owned the NFL’s No. 2 scoring defense and total defense versus ranking No. 9 in total offense and No. 15 in scoring offense.\n\nSpagnuolo worked in Kansas City with Titans GM Mike Borgonzi from 2019-2024, lending some familiarity to the interview process.\n\nThe Titans fired former coach Brian Callahan in October after a 1-5 start to the 2025 season that followed a 3-14 debut year in 2024. Under interim coach Mike McCoy, the Titans finished the 2025 season with another 3-14 record and earned the No. 4 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Titans have announced completed head coach interviews with the following candidates:\n\nKevin Stefanski, former Browns HC\n\nJason Garrett, former Cowboys HC\n\nThe Titans have also scheduled interviews with or requested interviews from the following candidates: Former Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, former Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh.\n\nNick Suss is the Titans beat writer for The Tennessean.

    "fullText": "The 2025 season for Kansas City Chiefs offensive lineman Kingsley Suamataia was a period of significant growth amid uncertainty.\n\n“He (Kingsley Suamataia) did a great job, arrow up—still ways to go, which is normal. The kid went from being a tackle to a guard.” said offensive coordinator Matt Nagy in a recent press conference, “There’s the part of you think of a guy like Joe Thuney and at that position (and) at the guard position, Trey Smith, these guys know the communication side of it, of what they’re doing with that part that sometimes never gets talked about, that communication side.”\n\nSuamataia started all 17 games at left guard in 2025, serving as one of the few consistent and available players during the season.\n\n“The physical side is what we all see on TV and what we all see on film, but what about the mental side of the mistakes or the things that you’re doing well that you can see,” said Nagy, “That’s where I think he has really grown there. The confidence is there, and he needs to just keep that going. The kid has the ability to be really special, and that’s just a credit to (General Manager Brett) Veach and (Head) Coach (Andy) Reid for bringing a guy like that in here.”\n\nThe former BYU standout finished with the most pass block snaps played at guard, according to Pro Football Focus. He will be a stabilizing force on the starting offensive line for a Chiefs team hoping for efficiency and availability heading into next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs OL Kingsley Suamataia displayed growth in sophomore season",

The teams playing during the NFL's Super Wild Card weekend feature numerous former Chiefs players who contributed to past Super Bowl seasons.\n\nThe Chicago Bears' dramatic comeback victory over the Green Bay Packers in Saturday's Wild Card game featured an unusual moment. Packers quarterback Jordan Love completed a pass to offensive lineman and former Chiefs 2022 draft pick Darian Kinnard.\n\nHe gained 6 yards before being stripped of the ball and then kicking it another 15 yards up the field, which could have been a Bears recovery. The ball was knocked out of bounds by Chicago while trying to dive on top of it. The result of the wild moment was the Packers' ball at the spot where Kinnard fumbled, since it couldn't be advanced by falling out of bounds.\n\nWHAT JUST HAPPENED 😳\n\nGBvsCHI on Prime Video\nAlso streaming on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/Rdmni2pnHw\n\nKinnard is one of only two players to win three consecutive Super Bowls, accomplishing it with wins in Super Bowls LVII and LVIII with the Chiefs and LIX with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Ex-Chiefs OL stars in bizarre highlight play during Wild Card game",

    "fullText": "SPRINGFIELD–For the first time since 2014, the Kansas City Chiefs are not in the NFL playoffs, and it’s a weird feeling down here, in Arrowhead South.\n\nSince the fall of 2015, the Chiefs had won 10 consecutive AFC West Division titles, and competed in the postseason each year. The height of KC’s playoff prowess came between 2019-2024, when the team reached the Super Bowl five times and won three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nHowever, the annual magic Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid are known for cooking up never materialized in 2025. Mahomes suffered a season-ending injury, a torn ACL, with three games left in the season, and watched as KC finished a disappointing 6-11, which was good enough to be second-to-last in the AFC West Division.\n\nSo, without their beloved team in the postseason for the first time, in more than a decade, how did Chiefs fans feel? Were they relieved? Upset? Indifferent? To find out the answers, I went to the Chiefs Mecca of the Ozarks, Coyotes Adobe Cafe. A.K.A. Arrowhead South.\n\nSure enough, I quickly ran into two fans — Deante Johnson and Jack Murphy. Both guys were about college age and shared their thoughts on having no dog in the fight in the playoffs.\n\n“Every year can’t be a winning year, so, we just gotta sit this one out and hope next year’s better,” said Deante Johnson. “Definitely a speed bump, it’s definitely not over. I mean, if we still have Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid, we’ll be fine.”\n\nMurphy echoed Johnson’s comments.\n\n“Last year was definitely heartbreaking,” said Jack Murphy. “Especially kinda getting pretty ran over in that super bowl, wasn’t fun, but as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid I mean, we can get right back there.”\n\nGlass-half-full kinda guys. The kind of fans you want to hear from. However, did they even care about the playoffs if the Chiefs weren’t in it? Or were they rooting for another team?\n\n“It’s been interesting,” Johnson said. “The NFL has definitely had a lot of unexpected teams come out, like Chicago…so it’s been fun to watch.”\n\nMurphy concurred and even admitted he’d like to see a team from the NFC take home the Super Bowl crown.\n\n“The Seahawks, for sure,” Murphy said. “I think it’s a really great story. I really like their head coach, and JSN (Jaxon Smith-Njigba) is a monster.”\n\nAs for Coyotes management, they too were disappointed Kansas City’s streak came to an unexpected end, but they still drew a good crowd for Sunday’s AFC wildcard game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n“For a decade that’s all we knew, but this year is a little different,” General Manager Jared Presley said. “We actually have other fans coming in this year and today we actually filled up with a bunch of Bills fans and a bunch of Jaguars, so it’s kind of a change, it’s good to see, but at the same time we’re kinda heart broken the Chiefs aren’t here.”\n\nOverall, the fanbase is still a little sore they don’t get to see if their favorite team vie for a chance to claim its fifth Super Bowl title, but, as Deante & Jack stated, “as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid, I mean, we can get right back there.”",

That's going to be on me, finally becoming a pro and then having to do that on my own, so I'm excited for that as well.\"\n\nBassa was selected in the fifth round with the 156th pick in this year's NFL Draft, developing into a versatile signal-caller and occasional secondary option while learning under key veterans. Bassa revealed the most eye-opening experience he had in 2025.\n\n\"I wouldn't say unexpected, but when it comes to surprises, I would have to say the time management (and) being on your own. When it comes to time off the field, I feel like I really did a good job of sorting that out, too. There's time where you can spend time for your wellbeing and on your own, like hanging out with your family or doing whatever you need to do, right?\" said Bassa, \"And then there are also times where you need to take care of your body outside of the facility as well. Where there's days you're off, if you play on a Thursday game you're off for a couple of days. I think it would really have to be the time management piece when it comes to that. Just treating it like I always have and taking that process one day at a time.\"\n\nBassa was named Honorable Mention All-Big Ten Conference with the Oregon Ducks in his last season. He played prominently on special teams as a rookie with the Chiefs, but could see more time on defense next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs LB Jeffrey Bassa reflects on lessons from his rookie season",

It was a move that became inevitable when head coach Dan Quinn stripped Whitt of defensive play-calling duties ahead of Week 11.\n\nThe Commanders hired a new offensive coordinator on Friday, promoting assistant quarterbacks coach David Blough. Don't expect Washington to promote an internal candidate for defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Commanders have interviewed three known candidates thus far. One of those candidates drew the attention of one of the NFL's top defensive stars.\n\nOne of the three known interviews is Chiefs' defensive line coach Joe Cullen. Considered one of the league's top defensive line coaches, Cullen has been with the Chiefs since 2022. When ESPN's Adam Schefter revealed that Cullen had interviewed with Washington, star defensive tackle Chris Jones had an interesting reaction on X.\n\nOh sh!+……. https://t.co/8b0bG5pSpR\n\n— Chris Jones (@StoneColdJones) January 9, 2026\n\nThat reaction would seem to indicate that Jones doesn't want to see Cullen leave Kansas City. Of course, who really knows?\n\nCullen, a former college nose guard at UMass, has been a coach since 1990. He's been an NFL assistant since 2006, working with multiple teams as the defensive line coach. He's been an NFL coordinator once before, albeit briefly. During Urban Meyer's forgettable NFL career, Cullen served as his defensive coordinator in 2021.\n\nThe Commanders have the No. 7 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and badly need a pass rusher.

Previously, the team that won the coin toss could elect to receive the kick, and would win the game with a touchdown on their first drive.\n\nThe outcry after Josh Allen and the Bills lost that playoff game without getting a chance to touch the football in overtime led to the revised rules.\n\nSo as the 2025-2026 NFL Playoffs get ready to begin, let’s revisit those rules, because you never know when you will need to know them.\n\nAll playoff games that advance to overtime will follow these revised rules:\n\nIf a game is tied at the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nBoth teams will have an opportunity to possess the football. This is the big change. Previously, as we saw in the 2022 AFC Divisional Round game between Kansas City and Buffalo, if the team that started with the football scored a touchdown, the game was over. Under the new rules, in that scenario, Buffalo would get a chance to match with a touchdown of their own, and if they did, the game would continue. Once both teams have had possession, the game then becomes sudden death. In addition, if the team that starts with possession scores and kicks the extra point to take a seven-point lead, the second team can win with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession is still in progress — the teams will play another overtime period. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nIf the game remains tied after two overtime periods, there will be a second half. The captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be a third coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII made a little history under the revised playoff rules.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII became the first playoff game under the league’s new overtime rules for the postseason, and those changes guaranteed each team a chance to possess the football in overtime. After the San Francisco 49ers kicked a field goal — more on that in a moment — Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs drove down the field and scored the game-winning touchdown on the final play of Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nThat made Super Bowl LVIII the first Super Bowl to see a lead change on the final play of the game.\n\nLooking back at how that unfolded, many wonder if the 49ers should have approached things differently.\n\nSan Francisco won the coin toss, and made the decision to receive the kickoff, despite a prevailing theory that under the new rules it made more sense to defer. With both teams guaranteed a possession, knowing what you need to score to win the game offers a competitive advantage, similar to how teams in college want to start on defense in overtime, so they know what they need to do on offense to win.\n\nInstead, the 49ers began on offense, and could only manage a field goal. That opened the door for the Chiefs to win the game on their guaranteed possession with a touchdown, which is exactly what they did.\n\nSpeaking after the game, San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan stated that the team had run through the various scenarios, and thought by starting on offense they would have the advantage if the game advanced to a third overtime possession, and sudden death.\n\n“None of us have a ton of experience with it,” Shanahan said. “We went through all the analytics and talked to those guys. We decided it would be better getting the ball because if both teams matched and scored, we wanted to be the ones to have a chance to go win it.”\n\nThe problem? The game never got to that third overtime.\n\nLast year, none of the playoff games advanced to overtime, so fans were not treated to another situation like Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nNor did they get a chance to see what, if anything, teams and coaches learned from how that game ended.\n\nAhead of the 2025 NFL season, the league decided to align the overtime rules for the regular season with the approach for the playoffs. However, that change was made “subject to a 10-minute overtime period in the regular season.”\n\nMeaning regular season games could still end in ties, unlike postseason games.\n\nLessons learned from Super Bowl LVIII seemed to come into play during overtime periods in the regular season. One example comes from when the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys went to overtime back in September. Green Bay won the coin toss ahead of overtime but elected to kick, since they were now guaranteed a possession even if Dallas scored a touchdown.\n\nGreen Bay held Dallas to a field goal, giving the Packers a chance to win the game with a touchdown. But when their drive stalled deep in Cowboys’ territory, Green Bay was forced to settle for a game-tying field goal.\n\nOther example from this past regular season indicate that teams will defer in overtime under the new rules. In October the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams went to overtime, with Los Angeles winning the coin toss. Sean McVay and the Rams chose to kick, giving the 49ers possession first.\n\nSan Francisco settled for a field goal, but the Rams were stopped on 4th-and-1 to end the game.\n\nIn November the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons went to overtime, with Carolina winning the toss. Quarterback Bryce Young declared “we want to kick that way,” which was incorrectly granted by the referee. A team can choose to kick, or which end zone to defend, but they cannot choose both.\n\nBut the Panthers indeed started on defense, forced a punt, and then kicked a game-winning field goal on the next drive.\n\nOne scenario that has not been tested yet? The impact of the two-point conversion. After Super Bowl LVIII Kansas City indicated that if necessary, they would have gone for two at the end of their possession to try and win, rather than kick an extra point and extend the game to a third overtime possession.\n\nShould overtime arise in this year’s playoffs, will the two-point conversion come into play?\n\nI guess we will have to wait to find out.",

Tate will be one of the first pass-catchers off the board, and could be exactly the kind of dynamic route-runner that Kansas City needs to reinvent its air attack.\n\nJohnson would immediately be able to take over as the Chiefs' leading rusher to bring some 'juice' to the ground game that Kansas City has sorely missed in the past few seasons.\n\nThis might not be the most exciting pick, but Orange — nicknamed 'Big Citrus' — is exactly the kind of run-stuffer that the Chiefs need in the middle of their defensive line.\n\nKansas City selected Nohl Williams out of Cal last year, and takes Masses here in the fourth round to add another former Golden Bear ball-hawk on Day 3.\n\nGiven that the Chiefs ended the season with their third-string quarterback under center, it seems logical that Kansas City might decide to invest a pick at the position this year. Allar was once considered one of the most exciting quarterback prospects in college football, and joins the Chiefs in Round 5 to become Patrick Mahomes' long-term understudy.\n\nAfter addressing wide receiver and running back early, Kansas City targets Gyllenborg to round out its selections of offensive skill position players.\n\nTapp tallied 12 tackles for loss and 7.5 sacks in 2025 and joins the Chiefs as a developmental prospect who could potentially help bolster the edges of Kansas City's defensive line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL Draft: Chiefs take WR, RB early in this seven round mock",

With Marquise Brown, Travis Kelce, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton all entering free agency, the team desperately needs another quality pass catcher capable of elevating the offense.\n\nGeorgia State Panthers wide receiver Ted Hurst is a more well-rounded receiver than Thornton and more explosive than Smith-Schuster. His 6’3”, 195 lbs. frame also separates him from existing members of the Chiefs wide receiver room. Hurst projects as a top 100 selection who should grow into a contributor by the mid-point of his rookie season.\n\nHurst explodes off the line of scrimmage and displays the agile footwork to work across the faces of cornerbacks during his release. He lacks elite speed but uses his initial burst to overtake and stack cornerbacks. While Hurst’s speed isn’t special, he succeeded in stretching the field and generating chunk gains with his long strides at Georgia State.\n\nGeorgia State WR Ted Hurst is my #1 offensive prospect from the G5. \n\n- 6’3/195 \n- goal line fade machine\n- crisp route runner with sudden deceleration\n- elusive after the catch (17 mtkl forced this year)\n- burst to stack press-man\n- good not great top gear\n- cuts routes off vs.… pic.twitter.com/LvUgymsCJO\n\n— James Foster (@NoFlagsFilm) November 15, 2025\n\nDespite being a taller receiver, Hurst sinks his hips well at the top of the route stem and executes effective cuts and route fakes. His route definition occasionally suffers on digs, but he generates natural separation on curls and comebacks.\n\nHurst regularly finds open space against zone coverage and runs his routes to precise depths to move the chains. His work against press coverage needs to improve. The Georgia native is lean and lacks the play strength to power through jams at the line of scrimmage. This makes it easier for cornerbacks to re-route him and impact the timing of the offense’s plays.\n\nHurst caught 61.1% of his contested targets over the past two years. He isn’t a bully at the catch point but tracks the ball well and makes great adjustments to secure receptions through contact. Hurst drops easier receptions due to lapses of concentration, but he dials in for contested opportunities.\n\nHurst lacks the mass and power to break tackles after the catch, but his long strides and agility make him a threat to find open space and gash defenses. He uses jump cuts and his springy footwork to evade defenders while probing for room to run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL draft scouting report: Georgia State Panthers WR Ted Hurst",

He had previously served as Kansas City's quarterbacks coach from 2013 until 2015, and was the Chiefs' offensive coordinator in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe #Titans are off and running, requesting to interview #Chiefs OC Matt Nagy for their HC job.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 5, 2026\n\nWhile Rapoport's report indicated that Tennessee is \"requesting to interview\" Nagy, the veteran coordinator's contract expires at the end of the 2025 season, at which point he will become a free agent.\n\nStay tuned to see if Nagy will land with the Titans — and who the Chiefs might tab to replace him in the event that he leaves Kansas City in the offseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Titans request interview with Chiefs OC Matt Nagy for vacant HC job",

    "description": "The biggest question in football was asked last night to Travis Kelce, and he had an answer.",
    "fullText": "After Travis Kelce exited the field solemnly on Sunday night in Las Vegas after the Kansas City Chiefs fell for the final time this NFL season, there was one question on every fan, pundit, and probably even player’s mind:\n\nWas that the last game Travis Kelce ever played?\n\nOn Monday, we have somewhat of an answer, albeit one many fans might not have wanted to hear.\n\nFollowing the team’s game, Kelce shuffled into the locker room and was faced with questions from the media about his future plans with the Chiefs and if he had already decided on his future.\n\nKelce admitted that after the Chiefs' Super Bowl loss last year, he instantly knew he would be back with the Chiefs the next season. He wasn’t going to let his career end that way, and he was motivated that night to return to play with the only franchise he’s ever known.\n\nAfter the Raiders' loss, however, he was much more split. He explained that he doesn’t know at the moment when he will decide what he will do for the rest of the year regarding football.\n\nOne of the most successful players on and off the field, Kelce is scheduled to marry his partner, world pop star Taylor Swift, this coming June in Rhode Island.\n\nHe also hosts one of the most popular podcasts in North America, “New Heights” with his brother, retired NFL lineman and fellow Super Bowl champion Jason Kelce.\n\nEven Travis’ mother, Donna, is set to make her big television debut in only a few days on “The Traitors,” a competitive reality show produced by NBC on Peacock.\n\nWe will keep you updated on Kelce’s decision on whether he will play his 14th season in the NFL or if Sunday was his last dance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Did Travis Kelce Retire From NFL, Chiefs After Week 18 Loss?",

    "description": "Take a look at our staff predictions for the Kansas City Chiefs' Week 18 matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs will take the field for the final time this season when they face the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium this afternoon.\n\n2025 was a difficult year for the Chiefs. After losing in Super Bowl LIX, Kansas City attempted to retool its roster in the offseason. But despite their best efforts, the Chiefs found themselves eliminated from playoff contention after a midseason collapse.\n\nNow 6-10, Kansas City will have a chance to end its disastrous 2025 campaign on a high note against a bitter rival.\n\nCheck out our staff predictions for the Chiefs' Week 18 matchup against the Raiders:\n\nThe 2025 season officially comes to an end in Week 18 as the Kansas City Chiefs attempt to get back in the win column.\n\nThe offense will primarily focus on Travis Kelce, who could be playing in his final NFL game. Chris Oladokun will produce better results after a full week of practice, as he hopes to raise his stock for next season. The Chiefs' running backs will be closely watched as Dameon Pierce is expected to make his team debut.\n\nThe defense should continue to play well as young players gain experience. The unit has performed well during the late-season losing streak. Every rep is necessary to build for the offseason into the 2026 campaign.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 13, Raiders 10\n\nKansas City will finally finish its rollercoaster season on Sunday before a long and much-needed offseason break.\n\nFrankly, there's no way to tell how Sunday's game will play out. The Chiefs are down to backups and third-stringers as head coach Andy Reid looks to avoid injuries ahead of the offseason. Quarterback Chris Oladokun was serviceable in last week's loss to the Denver Broncos, but with several offensive stars on Kansas City's injury report in Week 18, a high-scoring game is likely out of the question. Still, expect a big game from tight end Travis Kelce as he potentially takes the field for the final time.\n\nQuarterback Bo Nix tore the Chiefs' defense apart in Week 17, when he threw for 182 yards and a touchdown. It is still unknown who the Raiders will have under center on Sunday, though it will likely be backup quarterback Kenny Pickett. Pickett may not be as threatening as Nix, but the former Pittsburgh Steeler is still good for the occasional legacy game. With no real incentives on the line, Kansas City's defense will most likely fail to stop the veteran backup.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 21, Raiders 23\n\nKansas City has every incentive to lose this game. Draft position is all that matters at this point, and while a meaningless win would make the Chiefs' disastrous 2025 campaign look a little better on paper, a 6-11 record could help Kansas City maximize the trappings of its failure in April.\n\nDown to their third-string quarterback, the Chiefs would almost certainly be considered underdogs against any other opponent. Only the lowly Raiders could make this Kansas City team look competent.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 12, Raiders 8\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs vs. Raiders: 3 predictions for AFC West showdown in Week 18",

Expect a better performance with 10 days to prepare for this one.\n\nQBs Kenny Pickett and Aidan O'Connell.

This hasn't been the kind of season Jeanty envisioned, but he is 112 yards from 1,000.

But Kansas City has given up 409 yards rushing in missed tackles, according to Next Gen Stats. Jeanty has gained 350 yards after breaking tackles, so he might have a chance.\n\nChiefs: RG Trey Smith (ankle) is unlikely to play. The Chiefs already have OTs Jawaan Taylor, Wanya Morris and Josh Simmons on injured reserve, along with Mahomes, Minshew, CBs Trent McDuffie Chris Roland-Wallace and Jaylen Watson, LB Leo Chenal and WRs Rashee Rice, Nikko Remigio and Tyquan Thornton.\n\nRaiders: QB Geno Smith (ankle) likely won't play. ... DT Adam Butler (bicep) wasn’t as seriously hurt as feared and could play. ...

The Chiefs are 5-0 against the Raiders at Allegiant Stadium, and KC defeated San Francisco in the Super Bowl two seasons ago. ... The Chiefs and Raiders have met in three playoff games with Kansas City winning two of them.\n\nKansas City has lost five straight and seven of its past nine. ... The Chiefs are assured of their first losing season since 2012, the year before Andy Reid took over as coach. They went 2-14 that season under Romeo Crennel. ... Kansas City has had 272 yards of offense combined over the past two weeks. It has not eclipsed 275 yards in any of its past four games. ... Chiefs TE Travis Kelce needs 46 yards receiving to reach 13,000 for his career. He has caught a pass in 189 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NFL and longest streak in franchise history. ... DT Chris Jones needs one sack to tie Neil Smith (85 1/2) for third most in Chiefs history. ... The Raiders have lost 10 consecutive games, tied with a skid last season for the fifth-longest skid in franchise history. Another defeat would tie for the third longest which was set in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. The Raiders' longest losing streaks were 19 games in the 1961-62 seasons and 16 in 2013-14. ... Las Vegas' losing streak is the longest active one in the NFL. ... The Raiders have a point differential of minus-193, worst in the NFL. ... Their average point different is minus-12.1 per game. If it doesn't improve, that will be the highest since the 2020 New York Jets finished with a minus-13.4 average. ... RB Ashton Jeanty is one of two rookies ever with at least 800 yards rushing, five rushing touchdowns and five receiving TDs. The other is Hall of Famer Gale Sayers in 1965. ... LB Devin White's 168 tackles are second to Miami's Jordyn Brooks, who has 174. ... ... The Raiders have held opponents to zero or negative yards on 95 rushing plays, tied with Minnesota for best in the league. ... A victory would give Las Vegas coach Pete Carroll 173 for his career, which would move him into a tie for 16th with Jeff Fisher. Carroll is currently tied with Bill Parcells.\n\nThe Chiefs defense might be worth a look given the Raiders offensive struggles.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have a lot of decisions to make this offseason. After a poor season that will end with them missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014, coaching and philosophy changes are at the top of the wish list for many fans, as is an offensive weapon or two. That said, there will be departures that Kansas City will have to replace - one of which very well could be pending free agent Jaylen Watson.\n\nWatson has been a tremendous success story for the Chiefs, making the roster as a rookie seventh-round pick in 2022 and working his way to becoming a starter. That said, Kristopher Knox of Bleacher Report predicts that the Tennessee Titans will sign Watson to a three-year, $40 million deal.\n\n\"In 15 starts this season, Watson allowed an opposing passer rating of only 79.0 in coverage,\" Knox writes. \"Watson should draw strong interest on the open market, even if he isn't the most notable cornerback available—Riq Woolen, Greg Newsome II, and Alontae Taylor are arguably bigger names. Don't be surprised if the Tennessee Titans make a strong push to land him.\"\n\n\"The Titans need an influx of talent and are projected to have the third-most cap space in the league in 2026. They could also use corner help to bolster a defense ranked 29th in net yards per pass attempt allowed. Tennessee also employs general manager Mike Borgonzi, who joined the Titans after 16 seasons with Kansas City.\"\n\nThe Chiefs will likely look very different on both sides of the ball in 2026, and losing Watson would certainly be a big reason for that.\n\nChiefs predicted to sign star NFC running back to $29 million deal\n\nDolphins seek help from ESPN broadcaster in general manager search\n\nGiants reportedly targeting former Coach of the Year as their next head coach\n\nBlockbuster trade proposal sends $106 million star to Buffalo Bills\n\nBears projected to steal AFC running back with $34 million contract",

Do everything we can to win,\" said Nagy, \"As an offense, our part of it is making sure that we understand that this part of the season, going into the final game, it's been a while since we've been in this territory, mentally as you go through the week of the prep stuff and then different players in different positions playing, that sort of thing. So, no matter who it is, the one common denominator is we have the same schedule throughout the week, with the practices, the same mindset for us of going in and trying to do everything we can to play well and win.\"\n\nThe Chiefs' offense has struggled with consistency and big plays all season, even when Patrick Mahomes was healthy. Nagy believes in the team's future as he tries to piece together what went wrong in 2025.\n\n\"Big picture offensively for us is I think all of us understanding that the season didn't go as we wanted to in the end. There were parts of the year in the middle of the season where we felt like – and I think I brought this up to you before, we really felt like we were at a peak level offensively,\" said Nagy, \"Unfortunately, it didn't last all the way through the year. Now here we are at the end of the year playing in this game that is important to us to finish strong, and it's our job to do that, to coach strong players to play strong, and then in the end, win. I think the last several games didn't go how we wanted, but we want to finish on a high note.\"\n\nKansas City's lone touchdown in Week 17 was led by quarterback Chris Oladokun, who completed 13-of-22 passes for 66 yards and a touchdown. He connected with running back Brashard Smith for a 5-yard score early in the second quarter.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs OC Matt Nagy evaluates offense heading into the season finale",

    "description": "Now that the Kansas City Chiefs have committed to building a new stadium and team headquarters in Kansas, what’s next for the Truman Sports Complex?",
    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Now that the Kansas City Chiefs have committed to building a new stadium and team headquarters in Kansas, what’s next for the Truman Sports Complex?\n\nWhile the Royals could still renew their lease with Jackson County, county legislator Manny Abarca says it’s time to start thinking about the future of the land.\n\n“At the end of 2031, December 1, something will change and we want to be ready for that with a plan, with a strategy, if we’ve got to tear down one or two stadiums, we should be prepared for that, not waiting for after the fact,” Abarca said.\n\nAbarca wrote a letter to Jackson County Executive Phil LeVota on Wednesday, with a plan to use the existing Repair, Maintenance, Management, and Operations (RMMO) fund to set aside money for the potential demolition of one or both stadiums and the redevelopment of the land.\n\n“We’ve got to have a strategic plan going forward,” Abarca said.\n\n“That opportunity of us, scrapping some of that maintenance and repair money towards the strategic plan is still within our RMMO accounts. So, there’s some opportunity. We just have to be willing to do it.”\n\nCurrently, a 3/8 cent sales tax sends roughly $55 million annually to the complex’s upkeep and renovations. Saving half of that money over the course of the next 5 years could amount to north of $137 million.\n\nAs for what’s next for the land, Abarca says it could be of huge benefit for the county.\n\n“I think we can look at that as a county park, as a county asset. There were houses there before and so I think there’s an opportunity to look at that as a public housing option if there aren’t stadiums there. It’s adjacent to our Rock Island corridor, which is currently a bike route, but could be a mass transit route. There’s a lot of opportunity, right? Its geographic location is really center of our county.”\n\nWhether the Royals decide to stay at Truman or leave, Abarca says it’s time to be prepared for the next phase of that land.\n\n“Before taxpayers were asked to fund stadiums, this was a green space. These were neighborhoods. These were communities. There’s vibrancy that was there before. Now, instead of walking away with an abandoned stadium, that can be 30 to 50 to $70 million to tear down and maybe two of those, it can at least be a green space.”",

    "fullText": "The conversations about whether or not Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce will catch another pass from Patrick Mahomes have dominated his retirement rumors. Kelce's in-depth conversation with team legend Tony Gonzalez aired on Prime Sports before last Thursday's Christmas game and addressed multiple topics, including Mahomes.\n\nThe conversation was filmed at Kelce and Patrick Mahomes' 1587 Prime restaurant, with the 11-time Pro Bowler opening up about his friendship with the two-time league MVP.\n\n\"He's (Patrick Mahomes) family now. I think through all the hard work and all the family time that we've had outside the facility and outside the building, there'll definitely never be a goodbye to him, It'll just be like another day in the life with Patty Mahomes.\" said Kelce, \"What he's been to my career up to this point, you can't measure it. It's all the little things that you see manifest out there onto the field that we're working on every single week, every single offseason. When he came into the league, he took this thing by storm. It's been a fun ride ever since he's been at the helm.\"\n\nSince Mahomes became the starting quarterback in 2018, the duo has been inseparable on the field. Their production and chemistry are unmatched, but their future remains murky heading into the offseason, especially after Kelce was asked that question during a recent press conference.\n\n\"That was a harsh reality when I got asked that. I was like, 'Oh man, that's a dark way to look at it.' I think, I don't know, I'll always be able to go out there in the backyard slinging around with the old Texas gunslinger,\" said Kelce, \"But you know that day is going to come. If it's already happened, I can feel pretty content with how many times he's connected on the field with me and how much success and how much fun we've had playing this game.\"\n\nMahomes was in attendance during the Chiefs' Christmas night home finale against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs TE Travis Kelce opens up about friendship with Patrick Mahomes",

Well, the Texans took care of business today and defeated the Chargers, which has clinched the AFC West for the Denver Broncos.\n\nAFC WEST CHAMPS.\n\nGoal No. 1 ✅\n\nAnd we’re still climbing. pic.twitter.com/yHbSmyw8Ww\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 28, 2025\n\nThis is the Broncos’ 16th AFC West Championship, their first since 2015, and the first for Head Coach Sean Payton and quarterback Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos have been on a magical run this season, and after starting the season 1-2, they ripped off 11 straight wins and are now AFC West champions and the favorites for the number one seed in the AFC. They have been led by their elite defense and second-year quarterback Bo Nix, who has improved as the season went on and has led multiple 4th quarter comebacks and game-winning drives.\n\nWith a postseason berth and now the AFC West locked up, the Broncos will set their sights on the number one seed in the AFC. They can clinch the one seed as early as tomorrow, but they will need a lot of help for that to happen. They will need the Patriots to lose to the Jets, the Bills to lose to the Eagles, and the Jaguars to lose to Grandpa Phillip Rivers and the Colts. All three of those scenarios playing out tomorrow are highly unlikely, so the Broncos will likely need to win next weekend, at Mile High, vs. the Chargers.\n\nThe Broncos are back where they belong. Three years ago, the team fired Nathaniel Hackett the day after Christmas and just signed quarterback Russell Wilson to a contract that would age poorly. Now, three years later. Sean Payton has led the Broncos back to being Super Bowl contenders, and Bo Nix is your franchise quarterback.\n\nTIME TO CELEBRATE BRONCOS COUNTRY, THE DENVER BRONCOS ARE YOUR 2025 AFC WEST CHAMPIONS!",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. — The Kansas City Chiefs are coming to Kansas City, Kansas as state leaders and team leadership announced the plan Monday.\n\nKansas is issuing Sales Tax and Revenue or STAR Bonds to pay for more than half of the $3 billion project. The state issues STAR Bonds to private investors and pays them back with new tax revenue.\n\nJohnson County officials, fans celebrate Chiefs stadium move\n\nRepublican State Senate President Ty Masterson said one of his requirements for approving the stadium deal as the Chair of the Legislative Coordinating Council (LCC) was that it wouldn’t lead to higher taxes. Masterson talked to FOX4 on Tuesday while he was in Andover, just a day after he was in Topeka for the big announcement.\n\n“Nobody. Worst case scenario, nobody buys the bonds, the bonds don’t get sold, the project doesn’t happen,” Masterson said when asked who’s on the hook if there isn’t the private interest in the buying of these bonds.\n\n“Not at all, I’m excited,” he said when asked if that concerned him at all that that’s a possibility.\n\n“I think there’s going to be general excitement. I think they’re even going to get a good rate for their bonds.”\n\nFOX4 took that comment to Washburn Political Science Professor Bob Beatty in Topeka. He says the nearly $2 billion in STAR Bonds that will be issued is a bit of an experience with the Chiefs stadium going up somewhere near I-70 and I-435 in Wyandotte County.\n\n“That being said, there’s an adage that basically goes around where you don’t bet against the NFL, Beatty said.\n\n“It has become a global phenomenon, and from the salaries, and the costs of stadiums and the amount of money that’s generated, and yes, even now the cache of Taylor Swift and celebrities, it’s not necessarily always a rational economic decision.”\n\nKC mayor vows to compete like hell’ in renewed border war after Chiefs announce move to Kansas\n\nTwo and a half hours after the Beatty interview, Kansas Department of Commerce Marketing and Communications Director Patrick Lowry sent FOX4 a statement.\n\n“The excitement surrounding bringing the Chiefs to Kansas and the new economic opportunities the stadium, facilities, and mixed-use developments will create, are sound reasons to be confident in the success of this project,” Lowry said.\n\nThe STAR Bond District appears to cover all of KCK, not to mention Western Johnson County.\n\n“I would say that with all humility, bringing the National Football League to Wyandotte and building the facility that we’re going to build is going to drive development,” Chiefs President Mark Donovan said Monday in relation to a question about the STAR Bond District.",

Young guys getting an opportunity to taste what this NFL life is like.\"\n\nWhen asked what was going through his head in what could have been his last game at Arrowhead stadium he talked about the fans that have supported him and the Chiefs.\n\n\"You only get a few of those moments where you just get to stand there and appreciate 60- to 70,000 Chiefs fans screaming for you.\"\n\nTaylor Swift wears engagement ring while cheering on Travis Kelce's college team\n\n\"I always embrace that moment, it's fun and hopefully I got everybody fired up for it,\" he added.\n\nIn terms of retirement, he said, \"I'll let that be a decision I'll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes.\"\n\nKelce's teammate Chris Jones, defensive tackle for the Chiefs, said in a separate post-game interview shared on YouTube by KMBC-TV that he hopes Thursday's game wasn't his last with Kelce.\n\n\"We just have been through so much together,\" he said. \"He's been like a brother. I hope he gives it one more year. Just one more, man. Just one more.\"\n\nESPN said that Kelce's fiancé Taylor Swift was in a stadium suite cheering him on.

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos once again played down to their competition against a Kansas City Chiefs team forced to play its third-string quarterback, but the Broncos somehow managed to overcome their struggles to win, 20-13 in a problematic game that once agains exposed their limitations.\n\nThis game was defined by four long Denver drives, one in each quarter. The first two came up short to produce a pair of Wil Lutz field goals, with gave the Chiefs a chance to hang around and counter with a touchdown on a short drive after a Bo Nix interception to make the score 7-6 at halftime.\n\nThe Chiefs actually scored first in the third quarter after a pass interference penalty on Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II gave KC the ball in Denver territory, which led to a 53-yard field goal by Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker that made it 10-6.\n\nThe Broncos proceeded to drive the field again, and this time Nix was able to finish by running the ball in from nine yards out for Denver’s first touchdown of the night. That gave the Broncos the lead, 13-10, but the Chiefs were able to counter with yet another Butker field goal from 47 yards after a 44-yard punt return by running back Brashard Smith.\n\nDenver’s final drive of the game was the fourth one to last for at least 14 plays, and Nix finished the 65-yard effort with a one-yard touchdown pass to running back RJ Harvey. The key play in the drive was a defensive offside penalty by Chiefs tackle Chris Jones that gave Denver a critical red-zone first down that led to the score.,\n\nThe Broncos were lucky to win this one, and Kansas City’s last-ditch scoring attempt featured some receiving heroics from Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. But a final pass to receiver Hollywood Brown in the end zone in the final seconds ended up bing an overthrow that allowed Denver to survive.\n\nNix was decidedly mediocre, producing just 182 yards passing as he went 26-for-38, and his longest throw of the night went for just 10 yards. The Broncos also struggled to run the ball effectively for most of the night, and it was this combination that allowed the Chiefs to stay within striking distance.\n\nThe Denver defense did what it had to do against third-string Chiefs quarterback Chris Oladokun, but there were some scary moments when bad tackling in the secondary once again nearly cost them. Oladokun passed for just 66 yards on the night as he went 13-for-22, but the fact that the Chiefs were in this one at all was mostly a testimony to the Broncos’ ongoing struggles.\n\nThe win gave Denver the pole position in the race for the top seed in the AFC, but it’s hard to imagine the Broncos making a deep playoff run given their lack of a running game and Nix’s ongoing issues with inconsistency. There’s a lot to fix before their final game against the Los Angeles Chargers, and that game will be for the AFC West title if the Chargers can defeat the Houston Texans on Saturday.\n\nThe Chiefs played valiantly given their offensive limitations and the fact that this game was meaningless for them, and they’ll wrap up their broken season with a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders that promises to feature some ugly football given where both teams are right now.",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce walked off the field at Arrowhead Stadium with a smile Thursday night, seemingly in good spirits. While we still don’t know if that was it for him at the stadium in Kansas City, and the 20-13 loss to the Denver Broncos wasn’t the best way to go out, Kelce still got plenty of love from Chiefs fans on his way out the door.\n\nKelce’s mom, Donna, and his fiancée, Taylor Swift, were in attendance, too. The walk back to the locker room this time felt different.\n\nTravis Kelce walks off the field after his last home game of the season 🫶 @tkelce | @chiefs pic.twitter.com/5keiEj8Hvu\n\n“You only get a few of those where you just get to stand there and appreciate 60-70,000 Chiefs fans screaming for you,” Kelce said in his postgame news conference. “I always embrace that moment, man. It’s fun. Hopefully I got everybody fired up for it.”\n\nKelce has spent his entire career with the Chiefs, who selected him in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft out of Cincinnati. He quickly became a fan favorite and played an integral part of the Chiefs’ dynastic run and their three Super Bowl wins. His public relationship with Swift has only skyrocketed his fame over the past several years.\n\nThe 11-time Pro Bowler is closing in on 13,000 career receiving yards and has 82 touchdowns on 1,077 catches over his 13 seasons in the league. All three of those figures are the most in franchise history. He had five catches for 36 yards Thursday night.\n\nBut at 36, Kelce is undoubtedly nearing the end of his career. There has been plenty of speculation that he may retire at the end of the season, especially considering the Chiefs are going to miss the playoffs for the first time since Kelce’s second season in the league. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes is recovering from an ACL and LCL injury he suffered earlier this month, making the start of next season unclear.\n\nIf Kelce were to retire after this season, which would mark the end of an era for the franchise that has dominated the league in recent years, Thursday’s game would be his final one at home. He's at the end of a two-year, $34.25 million deal with the team and would become a free agent in the coming months.\n\nKelce declined to give much clarity on the speculation postgame.\n\n“Honestly, I’ve been just focused on trying to win football games, man,” Kelce said about retirement. “I’ll let that be a decision that I make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes.”\n\nThe Chiefs will take on the Las Vegas Raiders next weekend to wrap up their season. Based on Kelce’s comments Thursday night, we won’t have an answer on his future until after that.\n\nBut if this was the end, considering the circumstances, Kelce sure took advantage of his final moments at Arrowhead.",

    "fullText": "Give credit to the Kansas City Chiefs defense, and to tight end Travis Kelce—they both came to play, and as a result the Chiefs were nearly able to pull off an improbable upset against the Denver Broncos, but the Chiefs’ offensive limitations ultimately resulted in a 20-13 loss.\n\nThis game was defined by four long Denver drives, one in each quarter. The first two came up short to produce a pair of Wil Lutz field goals, with gave the Chiefs a chance to hang around and counter with a touchdown on a short drive after a Bo Nix interception to make the score 7-6 at halftime.\n\nThe TD came on a 4-yard pass to running back Brashard Smith, and it was the first career touchdown bass for the Chiefs third-string quarterback, Chris Oladokun.\n\nThe Chiefs actually scored first in the third quarter after a pass interference penalty on Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II in Denver territory led to a 53-yard field goal by Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker that made it 10-6.\n\nThe Broncos proceeded to drive the field again, and this time Nix was able to finish by running the ball in from nine yards out for Denver’s first touchdown of the night. That gave the Broncos the lead, 13-10, but the Chiefs were able to counter with yet another Butker field goal from 47 yards after a 44-yard punt return by Smith.\n\nDenver’s final drive of the game was the fourth one to last for at least 14 plays, and Nix finished the 65-yard effort with a one-yard touchdown pass to running back RJ Harvey. The key play in the drive was a defensive offside penalty by Chiefs tackle Chris Jones that gave Denver a critical red-zone first down that led to the score.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the Chiefs were even able to give themselves a chance in this one. Oladokun passed for just 66 yards on the night as he went 13-for-22, although he did remain turnover-free. The running game had some moments as the Chiefs were able to pick up some occasional first downs, but Kansas City was simply outgunned in this one due to their quarterback injury issues.\n\nThe highlight of the night for the Chiefs was the final drive, which featured some receiving highlights from Kelce, who put Kansas City on his back and nearly win the game single-handed. Kelce was eventually double-teamed, though, and a final pass to receiver Hollywood Brown in the end zone wound up being an overthrow tight as Denver survived.\n\nThe Broncos will move on to play the Los Angeles Chargers for the AFC West title next week, assuming the Chargers can beat the Houston Texans on Saturday. That will officially end the Chiefs’ run of division titles at nine, while the Chiefs will close out their broken season against the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 18.",

    "description": "If Thursday night was the last game Travis Kelce played inside Arrowhead Stadium, he sure tried to make it a memorable one.

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — If Thursday night was the last game Travis Kelce played inside Arrowhead Stadium, he sure tried to make it a memorable one.\n\nThe Chiefs tight end only had five catches for 36 yards against Denver, playing alongside third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun while his good buddy Patrick Mahomes and backup Gardner Minshew were out with knee injuries. But several of those catches came in the closing minutes, nearly rallying Kansas City in what would have been a stunning upset of the Broncos.\n\nKelce and Co. wound up losing 20-13 in a game in which they were nearly two-touchdown underdogs.\n\nBut it was a gutsy display by him in a career filled with them.\n\nThe four-time All-Pro, who is expected to announce soon after the season whether he is retiring, could have hung up the cleats a couple of weeks ago, when the reigning AFC champions were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in a decade.\n\nInstead, after going to five Super Bowls — including the last three — and winning three championship rings, the 36-year-old Kelce showed that he had too much pride to quit on a lost season. He played in a humiliating loss to lowly Tennessee last week, and he was one of the few bright spots Thursday night for an offense that finished with 139 yards in all.\n\n“A whole lot of emotions,” Kelce said afterward. “You've got everybody in the world watching you. You get to go out there with the young guys on primetime television. Young guys getting an opportunity to taste what this NFL life is like.”\n\n“I’ll let that be a decision I’ll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes,” Kelce said.\n\nHe was the final player introduced Thursday night, following Oladokun out of the tunnel in the corner of Arrowhead Stadium. As red lights flashed across the field, Kelce emerged from the fog with his signature bow-and-arrow entrance gesture toward a festive holiday crowd, and it predictably roared in delight — perhaps for the last time — as No. 87 took the field.\n\n“You only get a few of those (moments) where you get to stand there and appreciate 60, 70-thousand Chiefs fans cheering for you,” Kelce said. “I always embrace that moment.”\n\nIn a suite high above, his fiancee, pop star Taylor Swift, watched him perform. So did Mahomes and Minshew, who took in the game together from a suite; Mahomes tore ligaments in his knee two weeks ago, Minshew did the same last week.\n\n“You feel the generations of happiness and the love that (the fans) have,” Kelce said. \"It’s a beautiful thing, man. It’s something I know I’ll cherish forever, whether it’s coming out of the tunnel or just making a big play for them. That’s why we love Arrowhead.”\n\nKelce has played 97 games inside the stadium over the course of a 13-year career. He caught 645 passes there, including playoffs, the third-most by any player inside a single stadium behind Jerry Rice and Larry Fitzgerald since the AFL-NFL merger.\n\nNow, the question is whether Kelce will play next week in the Chiefs' season finale in Las Vegas.\n\nHe needs just 10 yards receiving to reach 13,000 for his career, and he could extend his franchise record — and the longest active streak in the NFL — by catching a pass in his 191st game next weekend. He could also go out with a win, rather than having lost five straight and seven of his last eight games, which is the slide the Chiefs find themselves on now.\n\nOr, maybe he will surprise everyone and come back for one more year.\n\n“We've been through so much together,” Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones said, making his desire clear. \"Just one more (season). Just one more.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

He's providing some depth at tight end while Nate Adkins continues to deal with a lingering knee injury.\n\nBailey is providing depth with linebacker Dre Greenlaw out with a hamstring injury, and Bandy is doing the same at wide receiver, where the Broncos are missing rookie Pat Bryant in the concussion protocol.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "The Broncos face the Chiefs in Kansas City on Christmas. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "When the NFL schedule makers sat down to craft the Christmas slate of games, they likely envisioned the clash between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs as a battle for the AFC West title.\n\nWhile the Chiefs have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Broncos can wrap up their first AFC West title since 2015 with a win tonight, and a little bit of help from the Houston Texans on Saturday. In addition, Denver can also secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but they will need a little more help here in Week 17 to clinch the top seed.\n\nLet’s start with the AFC West title. Denver can clinch the division title this week, officially bringing to an end the Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nIn addition, Denver can also wrap up the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week, and the lone bye week in the AFC playoffs.\n\nBut they would need a lot of help to get that done.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWith the Chiefs already eliminated from the playoffs, this game will not have any tiebreaker implications for the Chiefs and Broncos directly.\n\nBut it could play a role for the Broncos when it comes to seeding, in a very narrow scenario.\n\nLooking at the AFC West, the Broncos lead the division with a 12-3 record, while the Chargers are in second place with an 11-4 record. If Denver beats the Chiefs and the Chargers beat the Texans on Saturday, the two teams will meet in Week 18 with the division title up for grabs.\n\nWhy? Because the Chargers against Denver earlier this season, and another win in Week 18 in this scenario, would see the two teams finish at 13-4. The first tiebreaker in a division is head-to-head record, which woudl give the Chargers the AFC West title.\n\nThen the Broncos would be seeded somewhere from No. 5 to No. 7, depending on how the Bills finish, who could also end the year with a 13-4 record. If, again in this scenario, the Bills finish with the same 13-4 record as Denver, the tiebreaker will be conference record. Right now, Buffalo is at 8-3, and they have one AFC game remaining so they would finish at 9-3 in this scenario.\n\nDenver right now has a 7-3 record in AFC games, and would finish at 8-4 in this scenario, dropping them behind the Bills.\n\nAgain, this is a very specific hypothetical, but this game could matter in a tiebreaker scenario.",

Let's meet the Chiefs' starting quarterback replacing Mahomes and Minshew.\n\nOladokun played six seasons of college football from 2016 to 2021, including three at South Florida, two at Samford, and one at South Dakota State. Though he received eight starts with Samford in 2019, his lone season as a full-time starter came in 2021, his final year in college, with South Dakota State.\n\nDuring the 2021 campaign with the Jackrabbits, Oladokun tossed 25 touchdowns to just seven interceptions, leading South Dakota State to an 11-4 record.\n\nAfter a successful season with the Jackrabbits, Oladokun headed to the NFL, where he was a seventh-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was released by Pittsburgh during final cuts and found a home in Kansas City afterwards.\n\nOladokun has been with the Chiefs since, winning two Super Bowls on the practice squad. He made his first NFL appearance against the Broncos in 2024, but his true debut came in Week 16 of the 2025 campaign versus the Titans.\n\nIn Tennessee last week, Oladokun completed 11 of 16 passes for 116 yards in Kansas City's blowout loss.

    "fullText": "Chiefs vs. Broncos live score, updates, highlights from 2025 NFL Christmas game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Broncos\n\nThe NFL on Christmas Day delivers an AFC West rivalry matchup unlike any seen in the last decade, as the Denver Broncos (12-3) travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs (6-9) at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nIn a stunning reversal of roles, the Broncos enter as the dominant force, aiming to secure the AFC West title and remain firmly in the driver's seat for the conference's crucial No. 1 overall seed and the coveted first-round bye. With the Los Angeles Chargers breathing down their necks, a victory over the crippled Chiefs would officially clinch the AFC West for Denver, ending Kansas City's unprecedented nine-year reign as division champions and marking this holiday game as perhaps the most significant in Denver's last ten years.\n\nFor the three-time defending AFC Champion Chiefs, this prime-time holiday slot is a bittersweet stage for an unfamiliar role. Having already been officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era, the Chiefs have seen their season completely unravel, suffering a losing record for the first time since 2012. The franchise is currently battling devastating injuries, with Mahomes and his backup Gardner Minshew both sidelined by ACL injuries, leaving the offense to be managed by third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun. The team that was once the gatekeeper of the AFC has become a hollow shell of its dynasty self.\n\nThe stark contrast in stakes presents a unique challenge to the streaking Broncos, who must overcome a late-season loss to the Jaguars that snapped their 11-game winning streak. Head Coach Sean Payton is stressing focus, emphasizing that despite the Chiefs' struggles, a division title and the No. 1 seed are still their stated goals. A win in Kansas City, where the Broncos have historically struggled, would not only solidify their resurgence but would also serve as the ceremonial passing of the torch, ushering in a new era of dominance in the AFC West.\n\nThis Christmas night contest marks a seismic shift in the AFC power structure. What was once the annual, late-season coronation of the Chiefs is now the potential crowning moment for the Broncos — a team ready to reclaim the top spot in the AFC West and send a clear message to the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Chiefs vs. Broncos on Christmas.

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos will take the field for an epic AFC West showdown at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas Day.\n\nWith just two weeks remaining in the regular season, Kansas City has found itself eliminated from playoff contention and set to play for nothing but pride in front of a home crowd.\n\nDenver is vying to win the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs and is considered the favorite to win today's holiday showdown.\n\nTake a look at our staff predictions to get a better idea of how the Week 17 contest between Kansas City and the Broncos might play out:\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs will play the spoiler role on Christmas night against the Denver Broncos. The disappointing season can end on a relatively high note in the home regular-season finale for a fanbase that needs something extra to cheer about during the holidays.\n\nChris Oladokun will make his first career NFL start on a national stage with all to gain in this division tilt. The running game will be in the spotlight, as the third-string quarterback shouldn't be relied on to throw for 300+ yards in his first start against a ferocious defense. Harrison Butker should be utilized often, depending on the efficiency of the drives.\n\nThe Chiefs' defense will be motivated to pressure Bo Nix often to give themselves a chance to win. The turnover battle needs to be in their favor, and they need to rely on the energy from the Arrowhead Stadium crowd.\n\nFinal score: Broncos 24, Chiefs 14\n\nWith two games left to play this season, Kansas City's sixteen-week-long nightmare is almost over.\n\nThe primary focus of Thursday's matchup will be the effort of the Chiefs' backups. A victory, though not entirely out of the question, is unlikely given the state of Kansas City's roster. Major performances from second- and third-string players could help answer some of the many questions the Chiefs have going into the offseason.\n\nOne key player to watch on Thursday will be superstar tight end Travis Kelce, who very well may be playing his final game at Arrowhead. The four-time All-Pro will be quarterback Chris Oladokun's primary target as he looks to finish off his thirteenth season as Kansas City's top receiver. Expect Kelce to have a solid outing on Thursday, though it will not be enough to secure a win.\n\nFinal score: Broncos 28, Chiefs 13\n\nKansas City will almost certainly lose this game. If they don't, it should be considered a Christmas miracle. Expect Denver to take an early lead and pull its starters when the game is in hand. It may be best for younger Chiefs fans to avert their eyes.\n\nAt least we have the draft to look forward to.\n\nFinal score: Broncos 33, Chiefs 3\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 3 predictions for Chiefs' Christmas Day showdown vs. Broncos",

    "description": "STAR bonds are like a credit card: We buy the gifts now, but then we pay for them for the next 20 years. | Opinion",
    "fullText": "Merry Christmas, Kansans — or should I say the Whos in Whoville?\n\nWe are finally getting a major professional sports team. To quote my baby sister, “We got just what we wanted, but there was that one thing.” Isn’t there always just that one more thing that we want? In this case, we all know that’s the Royals — but it doesn’t stop there. We need to talk seriously about overuse of the state’s STAR bonds.\n\nYes, I am feeling particularly Grinchy this year.\n\nTo be fair, STAR bonds have served good purposes in Kansas for almost 30 years. The building of the Legends and the Kansas Speedway shave been good things for Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, which was once a food desert. Other communities throughout the state such as Dodge City, Hutchinson, Wichita and many others have benefited from STAR bonds by enhancing the cultural and entertainment appeal of their communities.\n\nHowever, this Professor Grinch is beginning to believe that STAR bonds are becoming a problem. This one is a blowout year on the old STAR bond credit card — because we buy the gifts now, but then we pay for them for the next 20 years. All the Whos will insist that they are not really raising taxes with the STAR bonds, but that isn’t really true. The state and its municipalities are giving up all the additional revenue that would have naturally compounded anyway.\n\nIn the case of the Chiefs, the proposed stadium and entertainment district spans two counties and eight municipalities by my count. The big dollars, though, will come from the state of Kansas, which has a sales tax rate of 6.5%, compared with the 1.25% in my little corner of Douglas County. So, Kansas will be paying off the stadium project with lower sales tax yields for the next 20 years from the already fastest-growing part of the state.\n\nThe Whos might also point out that like all STAR bonds, those offered to the Chiefs are designed to increase sales tax revenue, and so they would just capture that expansion. Professor Grinch would point out that inflation is nearly constant, which means that the sales tax yields would increase naturally anyway.\n\nAnd this was already set to be a blowout year on STAR bonds, with projects in Wichita, Lawrence, Bonner Springs and others. At least three former STAR bond projects have failed, including the Schlitterbahn water park, Heartland Park in Topeka and the Museum at Prairiefire. It is hard to see where this ends, but when communities can put the state on the hook for new amenities, they and their developer partners are not going to ask for the STAR bond program to go away.\n\nThe question that needs to be asked is whether projects such as sports arenas and amusement parks are things that the state needs, and whether all the Whos in Kansas are willing to pay for them.\n\nProfessor Grinch’s heart is likely two sizes too small, but he would really like for someone to go steal that STAR bond credit card, cut it up into a million pieces and throw it in the trash.\n\nZach Mohr is an associate professor of public budgeting and finance at the University of Kansas, and even his kids think he is a Grinch.",

    "fullText": "Chris Oladokun’s friend, Jake, texted last Saturday night to say he was making the drive from Asheville, North Carolina, to Nashville, where the Chiefs were facing the Tennessee Titans the next day. It would be cool, Jake told him, to see his friend in a Chiefs uniform as the team’s understudy at quarterback.\n\nBut as Jake entered Nissan Stadium and looked up at the video board, he got an eyeful. There was No. 19 for the Chiefs on the field.\n\n“And he’s like, ‘Is Chris in the game?’” Oladokun said.\n\nYes, he was. A knee injury to starter Gardner Minshew, who was subbing for the injured Patrick Mahomes, meant the first serious playing time in his NFL career for the former Sickles and Alonso High School standout.\n\nOladokun has played in numerous preseason games for the Chiefs since joining the team in 2022 and in last season’s regular-season finale at Denver Oladokun logged five mop-up snaps in his NFL debut.\n\nThis was different. Oladokun was the man on the spot. It didn’t end in victory, with the Chiefs absorbing a 26-9 loss. But Oladokun received encouraging feedback and personally felt good about his 31-snap appearance. He completed 11 of 16 passes for 111 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.\n\n“There’s always something to clean up,” said Oladokun, who played his first three college seasons at USF before finishing at South Dakota State and being a seventh-round draft pick by the Steelers in 2022.\n\nOladokun said every offensive possession started with teammates providing reassurance, especially guard Trey Smith.\n\n“Every single drive,” Oladokun said. “Trey would look back at me, and he’s like, ‘I’ve got your back.’ It speaks to his character and the whole offense that they rallied behind me like that.”\n\nOffensive coordinator Matt Nagy said he knew Oladokun was ready soon after entering the game early in the second quarter. The Chiefs had called a play with jet motion, where a slot receiver is moving at full speed across the formation before the snap. But the timing was off.\n\n“What (Oladokun) did was stop him, he stopped the motion, let him get set and got the back in the right spot and made a simple play,” Nagy said. “That speaks to his calm and where he was early in the game.”",

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos will look to turn the page quickly on their tough loss a few days ago with a road win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. The Chiefs are down to their third string quarterback and have nothing left to play for. This is a game the Broncos should win and if they don’t, then the real questions begin.\n\nWe’re pretty confident that this won’t be the case. The Broncos should coast to victory like they did against Kansas City in the final game of last season when they were resting starters instead of being long-eliminated from contention.\n\nDenver Broncos at Kansas City ChiefsP.M. Mile High time\nGEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri\nATS Betting Lines: Denver -13.5\nMoneyline Odds: Denver -1200 / Kansas City +750\nOver/Under: 36.5\nNote: All odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nCollectively, our Mile High Report staff is predicting a Broncos 27-11 win on the road over the Chiefs. Here’s how each of us predicted things would go individually:\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe line in this game is crazy…. if only because the over/under stands at 36.5. They expect the Chiefs offense to sputter and the Broncos offense to be ho-hum. I checked the weather and that isn’t going to be a factor at all it appears. Given all that, I’ll be cheeky here and predict a backdoor cover and an under. Now I just wait for the officiating crew to make it happen! – Tim Lynch\n\nThis one isn’t difficult. The Broncos should beat the Chiefs. It shouldn’t be close. The defense will be looking to make a statement, which should mean bad things for a 3rd string QB. Bo Nix will want some redemption from the loss to Jacksonville. – Adam Malnati\n\nAfter an incredible 11-game winning streak, the Broncos finally suffered their first loss since Week 3 of the regular season. On Christmas, they will play the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Even though the Chiefs will be playing their third-string quarterback, Denver can’t underestimate their division rival. The Broncos have to play a complete game, limit the miscues and mistakes, and find a way to win. Their hopes of an AFC West title and #1 seed depend on it. Ultimately, I believe the Broncos can bounce back to get their thirteenth win of the season. – Chris Hart\n\nNix and the Broncos should win this game. As others have noted, KC is down to their third-string QB and have been eliminated from the AFC Playoffs. But crazy things happen in December at Arrowhead. So Denver can’t look passed this game or just lollygag and expect to get the win. Approach this game like a must-win game, which it is, and put the poor showing against the Jags behind everyone. Take nothing for granted, play a complete game, and make Chiefs Kingdom’s Christmas a little less enjoyable. – Ian St. Clair",

Long shared his thoughts on this, which could affect Kelce's future playing.\n\n\"Well, there was a book I read when I was younger. It's called 'Where the Red Fern Grows'. It was about, I don't really know what it was about, but there were two dogs in it, and they were so dang close,\" said Long, \"They did everything together, they hunted together, they ate together, they slept together. And once, one of the dogs got hurt on a barbed-wire fence. The dog didn't make it. It's one of the saddest stories I've ever read, and then the other dog couldn't eat anymore. It was sad.\"\n\nMahomes and Kelce have been one of the league's greatest duos since the 2018 season. The prospect of them returning to form with a healthy Mahomes is a sight many Chiefs fans would love to see after a disappointing 2025 season.\n\n\"Is that what happens in Kansas City,\" said Long, \"or are we going to see Travis Kelce, like he did this past offseason, train his butt off, come in the best shape of his life, be a top-five producing tight end in football, and wait for his homeboy (Patrick Mahomes) to show back up at quarterback?

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce already has a good idea how tough a decision it is for an NFL player to retire.\n\nAlmost two years ago he watched his older brother Jason go through the process.\n\nTravis was sat in the front row of his retirement news conference, wiping away tears as a 36-year-old Jason announced he was ending his 13-year career with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nNow Travis is 36 and set to face a similar dilemma as he approaches the end of his 13th year.\n\nAfter winning three Super Bowls in the past six years with the Kansas City Chiefs, his contract expires at the end of the season.\n\nHaving failed to reach the play-offs for the first time in 11 years, the Chiefs' kingdom is finally crumbling.\n\nWith Kelce also expected to marry his fiancee Taylor Swift next summer, is now the time for one of the NFL's greatest tight ends to call it a day?",

    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver coach Connor Embree spoke with reporters recently about the dropped passes that plagued the team and evaluating the season of wide receiver Rashee Rice.\n\n“Mostly the drops I feel like this year have been with some stuff where it’s trying to get the ball and make a move before they catch it.” said Embree, “It’s usually with players that that’s their strength is catch the ball, get up the field – that’s first step, go, and it’s happened this year where some of those they didn’t look it all the way in before they started running.”\n\nDuring the Week 14 loss to the Houston Texans, Chiefs receivers dropped six passes, the most in a game during Patrick Mahomes’s tenure as the starting quarterback.\n\n“The suspension earlier in the season, he (Rashee Rice) was having a great training camp, preseason, and then he got suspended and had to get away for a couple of games,” said Embree, “And coming back, I thought he got off to a hot start and continued to get better throughout the year. I thought he got better, and he was trying his all to be out there with his team. Similar to Xavier (Worthy), he’s trying to take that leadership role and lead all the young guys.”\n\nRice was out with an injury in Week 16 against the Tennessee Titans and currently has collected 53 receptions for 571 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs WR Coach Connor Embree on dropped passes, Rashee Rice’s season",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) – Being a Kansas City Chiefs fan is often about loyalty and emotional commitment. But with the Chiefs announcing Monday that they would leave the historic Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri and move into a not-yet-built $3 billion stadium on the Kansas side of Kansas City, Kansas-based fans soon won’t need to root for their team across state lines.\n\n“That creates energy that I don’t think we really understand or really appreciate until it starts happening, until the stadium gets built, they play their first game, they play their first season,” Kevin Jenks, the president and CEO of the Wichita Sports Commission, said.\n\nThe Chiefs spent more than five decades playing at Arrowhead. They intend to build their new stadium in Wyandotte County, in the same area as Kansas Speedway and the Legends retail district.\n\n‘I just love Arrowhead’: Some Chiefs super fans not sold on move to Kansas\n\nEven though Wichita will be a few hours away from the new field, the hope is that the team’s presence can strengthen the area’s sports identity. Wichita Sports Commission hopes that includes strengthening ongoing partnerships with the franchise.\n\n“The Chiefs have been big proponents of getting flag football into high schools, and we were a part of that locally with some Wichita schools,” Jenks said. “We are still continuing to promote and be a part of that process.”\n\nDr. Larry Straub, an associate professor of business management at Newman University, says the Chiefs’ presence is likely to improve Kansas’ national image. However, he’s skeptical that the financial boom that comes with a major sports team moving in will echo around the state.\n\n“From an economics standpoint, I think the closer you are to Kansas City, the more benefits you’re going to have,” Straub said.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos will wear all-white uniforms against the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas Day, the team announced Monday.\n\nNFL teams are required to wear their alternate helmets for at least a week before using them in a game, and because the Broncos will have light sessions this week leading up to Thursday Night Football, they wore their alternate white helmet in practice last week. With the league's practice requirement met, Denver's alternate helmet is now prepped for a special Christmas Day showdown with a division rival.\n\nThe Broncos will complete an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and white socks. That would contrast nicely to a potential all-red look from the Chiefs.\n\nA winter White Out coming on Christmas Day 🥶 pic.twitter.com/Tdv7vmQFDK\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 23, 2025\n\nNFL teams are allowed to wear alternate/throwback uniforms up to four times per season. Denver previously wore its alternate blue jersey on Monday Night Football against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 4, and its throwback look against the Dallas Cowboys (Week 8) and Raiders (Week 10). The Broncos will wear the beautiful throwback uniform again against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 18 (Jan. 3/4).\n\nDenver unveiled a new uniform wardrobe last year, and the NFL relaxed its rules this offseason, allowing teams to wear alternate helmets with non-alterate jerseys, which is why Denver can wear its alternate helmet with its standard road jersey.\n\nBroncos fans can also look forward to the team's upcoming \"Rivalries\" series uniform, which is set to arrive in 2027.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL news: Broncos announce uniform for Christmas game vs. Chiefs",
