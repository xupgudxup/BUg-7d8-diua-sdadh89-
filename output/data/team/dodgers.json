    "fullText": "Former Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Cavan Biggio has signed a minor league deal with the Houston Astros.\n\nThe versatile left-handed hitter will join the team in spring training camp as a non-roster player.\n\nThe Astros announced that they have signed Cavan Biggio to a minor league deal pic.twitter.com/D8x0hjSyX8\n\n— FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) February 15, 2026\n\nThe 30-year-old is coming off a season in which he appeared in 37 games for the Kansas City Royals. The Royals had him all over the field, playing first base, second base, third base, two outfield positions and designated hitter.\n\nIn 69 major league at-bats with the Royals, Biggio slahed .174/.296/.246 with a .543 OPS and a 55 OPS+. Biggio also tallied 12 hits along with one home run and four RBIs.\n\nThe seven-year veteran reported to camp on Sunday and spoke about his excitement to get a chance with the Astros.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it was a big dream of mine, but the Astros, I loved that team more than anything growing up,” Cavan said. “Those teams growing up, I could name every player on those teams. This organization has always been very special for me, and it’s an absolute honor to don the uniform now.”\n\nCavan is the son of long-time Astors infielder, Craig Biggio. Craig played his entire 20-year career with the Astros and is the franchise’s leader in games played, at-bats, hits, runs, total bases, doubles and extra-base hits.\n\nCavan was the ball boy when Craig reached 3,000 career hits in 2007, alongside his brother, Conor.\n\n“That last year was something that obviously was truly special for us,” Craig said. “It was something that playing your whole career here with one team and one organization and being able to achieve a milestone like that in front of your fans and in front of your family and having your boys in the dugout as bat boy because they were old enough to do it, it was very special.”\n\nBiggio spent 30 games with the Dodgers in 2024. In 73 at-bats, the Houston native slashed .192/.306/.329 with a .635 OPS. He also recorded 14 hits, three home runs, 10 RBIs and 11 runs in his brief stint in L.A.\n\nHe was released in early August 2024 after he was traded to L.A. from the Toronto Blue Jays in June of that season.",

That is going to continue, and as I’ve said in the past in different contexts, anybody who underestimates the strength of the MLB Players Association does so at their own peril.”",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts belives superstar Mookie Betts will be in the MVP conversation this season.\n\nJack Vita of the Los Angeles Times shared Roberts comments via X.\n\n“Mookie [Betts] will be in the MVP conversation this year,” Roberts said.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts: “Mookie [Betts] will be in the MVP conversation this year”\n\n— Jack Vita (@JackVitaShow) February 18, 2026\n\nBetts will have some competition this season, especially on his own team. The overwhelming favorite to win MVP this season in the National League is none other than Shohei Ohtani. The 31-year-old two-way superstar is at the top of the leader board, and that comes as no surprise.\n\nBetts will have an uphill battle for that award, especially after the season he just endured. The Dodgers 2025 regular season was not magical at all, and neither was the four-time champions play.\n\nIn the season, the eight-time All-Star slashed .258/.326/.406 with a .732 OPS (the lowest of his career). Health was on Betts’ side as he played 150 games; however, he was never able to find his groove.\n\nBetts has finished inside the top 10 of MVP voting seven times in his career and in the top five five times. The Tennessee native is no stranger to MVP-level seasons; the only question is whether he can still produce at that level.\n\nThe six-time Gold Glove winner’s production has trended downward in recent seasons, and heading into Year 13, Father Time is beginning to loom. Fortunately for the Dodgers, they don’t need him to play superhero to contend.\n\nThe Dodgers are loaded with talent from top to bottom. If Betts is at least a bit better compared to last season, L.A. should have no problem cruising to their 10th title in franchise history.\n\nRoberts said on Wednesday that he is leaning towards having Betts bat No. 3 in the order against both left and right handed pitching in 2026.\n\nSince Ohtani arrived in Los Angeles, Betts was the No. 2 batter in the order. However, with a dip in productivity and the arrival of Kyle Tucker, that leaves Roberts with no choice. Still, Betts is expected to produce and play a big role for L.A.",

The first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.  “When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter.",
    "fullText": "DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the last person to leave the Toronto dugout after the Game 7 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series last fall because the star slugger wanted that to be the moment when he moved on.\n\nThe first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.\n\n“When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter. “Right then, I just turned the page.”\n\nThe Blue Jays lost the decisive game 5-4 in 11 innings, missing on a second consecutive chance to clinch the franchise's third championship at home. For manager John Schneider, this spring training is no different from a year ago.\n\n“The main message is we’re not defending anything,” Schneider said. “We’re not defending the AL East. We’re not defending the American League. We’re attacking 2026 like we did in 2025 or any year, really. You’re trying to win the division, you’re trying to win the World Series. That’s it.”\n\nGuerrero jolted the franchise at the start of the spring last year, when he said there was no deal on a new contract and that his own deadline for getting one done had passed, raising the specter of free agency in 2026.\n\nInstead, the sides settled on a $500 million, 14-year contract early last season, and the son of Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero went on to hit .292 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs.\n\nIn the postseason, Guerrero had a 1.289 OPS while hitting .397 with eight homers in 18 games and was MVP of the American League Championship Series. He didn't homer in any of his first three trips to the playoffs, and the Blue Jays lost all six of those games.\n\n“Going back to the postseason last year, I think it’s really cool for everyone to be on that heightened stage and to see how they responded,” Schneider said. “I think that kind of bleeds into this year, but (Guerrero) has been a little bit more vocal than I’ve ever seen him, a little bit more loose than I’ve ever seen him and understands that he’s one of the best players in the game.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Guerrero, a five-time All-Star, is now the longest-tenured Blue Jays player.\n\n“I don’t see myself as a leader,” Guerrero said. “I always put myself as a good teammate, and when you are a good teammate, then you become a good leader. I’m a good teammate.”\n\nHis role as the face of the franchise was cemented when Bo Bichette left the team, signing a $126 million, three-year with the New York Mets and moving from shortstop to third base.\n\n“It’s difficult not having him around,” said Guerrero, who played with Bichette through the minor leagues. “I mean, we played 10 years together. But at the same time, I understand it’s business, and he has to take care of his family as well.”\n\nThe Blue Jays signed Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto to fill the void left by Bichette while adding pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce.\n\n“I think we’re very capable,” Guerrero said. “I think it’s going to be more fun, and I’m actually more happy than last year.”\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

Now, with the offseason winding down, they could make one more move to make sure they are guaranteed to three-peat.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Mark Powell and Wynston Wilcox, that move is trading for Minnesota Twins two-time All-Star and Wilson Overall Defensive Player of the Year Byron Buxton. Buxton would anchor the outfield, and provide another All-Star bat to their lineup.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Padres trade sees San Diego land $330 million two-time MVP, would be massive upgrade from Gavin Sheets\n\n“What big-named player isn't going to have the interest of the LA Dodgers, right? They could use an upgrade on the corners in the outfield so this makes sense. And if you want to stay atop of MLB, the best way to do it is to have a bulletproof lineup. Adding Buxton just improves the bottom of their order. The only dangerous team is one that has a reputable batter, one through nine,” Powell and Wilcox wrote.\n\nThis past season, Buxton slashed .264/.327/.551/.878 with 21 doubles, 35 home runs, and 83 RBI in 126 games played. He would replace Andy Pages in the outfield, and would bring more power and a better glove as well.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Yankees trade sees New York land $330 million two-time MVP to create superstar outfield trio with Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger\n\nHe’s also incredibly cheap by the Dodgers’ standards.

    "fullText": "New York Mets owner Steve Cohen may have lost out on the Kyle Tucker sweepstakes, but he isn’t backing down from spending big on high-level free agents.\n\nAnthony DiComo, Mets beat writer for MLB.com, quoted Cohen admitting the Los Angeles Dodgers have built a high-level franchise, but he indicated he’s not intimidated.\n\n“They’re formidable,” DiComo shared on social media. “They have the ability to spend. So do I, by the way.”\n\nThe Dodgers have taken some criticism in recent years over their spending to acquire big-name free agents like Shohei Ohtani and Tucker.\n\nThe $240 million contract for Tucker in particular has renewed interest in a possible salary cap in Major League Baseball, which is the only major North American sports league without one.\n\nCohen has admitted he wanted to sign Tucker this offseason and was “annoyed” the team failed to land the prized outfielder.\n\nThe Mets also lost closer Edwin Díaz to the Dodgers, though they were able to sign infielder Bo Bichette, whom the Dodgers had targeted.\n\nIn an interview with Mets broadcaster Howie Rose, Cohen has made the case that the team ultimately is better off with Bichette over Tucker.\n\n“Frankly, once it was all done, and we got Bo to come to the Mets, (I) actually feel Bo might be a better fit for the team,” said Cohen, as reported by Tim Britton for The Athletic. “So I think things worked out for the best.”\n\nWhile fans and owners of other teams might feel like the Dodgers are bad for baseball, current players — even those who face off against the Boys in Blue regularly — love what the team is doing.\n\n“I f—ing love it,” San Diego Padre and former Dodger Manny Machado said of the Dodgers’ spending. “Every team should be doing it. …S— is f—ing great for the game. So I think every team has the ability to do it, so I hope all 30 teams can learn from that.”\n\nBryce Harper of the Philadelphia Phillies echoed that sentiment.\n\n“I love what the Dodgers do, obviously,” Harper said. “They pay the money, they spend the money. I mean, they’re a great team. They understand how to run it. They run their team like a business, and they run it the right way. They understand where they need to put their money into.”",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy cited loyalty and his desire to win when asked why he extended with the Dodgers.\n\nThe veteran has been with the Dodgers’ organization since 2017, and he has become a two-time All-Star and three-time World Series champion while playing for L.A. He signed a one-year extension for $7 million with a $10 million club option Thursday.\n\n“Part of me and who I am as a person and how I was raised, I like to be loyal to people,” Muncy said. “This organization took a chance on me when I was out of baseball, basically. That meant a lot to me. They stuck with me when things were going bad. They’ve never wavered on me at all. That means a lot to me in itself, and it’s just a place I’m very comfortable. My family’s comfortable here. We have a chance to win every single year. That’s why I play this game. I want to win.\n\n“Obviously, you make money in this game, but that’s not why I play. I play because I want to win. It’s the competitive fire that I want to go out and win as much as I can. That to me is worth more than money. I know I’m leaving money on the table, but I’m more than OK with that because I wouldn’t be OK with myself trying to chase money somewhere else, watching this team win and I’m on the sidelines. That’s just not who I am. I would rather win.\n\n“Another component to it is just the relationship I’ve built here. Like I was just saying, I like to be loyal and my relationships mean a lot. I’ve created such a relationship with the staff, the front office, the coaches, the medical and training staff, the clubhouse guys. I just don’t want to create that somewhere else. Being here for my entire career at this point would mean the world to me, and this gives me the chance to do that.”\n\nAsked Max Muncy about his latest extension, one of many team-friendly deals he has signed w/ the Dodgers since they gave him a second chance after he was released by the A's in 2017.\n\nHe knows he left money on the table, but he wouldn't be OK leaving and watching the Dodgers win: pic.twitter.com/hTyQCrCPT6\n\n— Rowan Kavner (@RowanKavner) February 13, 2026\n\nMuncy is the longest-tenured Dodger after Clayton Kershaw’s retirement, and is clearly a huge factor for the team if they’re winning to extend him though the 2028 season.\n\nHe had a great season in 2025 before struggling with injury, hitting 19 homers and tallying 67 RBIs through 100 games.\n\nThe 35-year-old also played a key role in the postseason, hitting an oft-forgotten homer in Game 7 of the World Series to cut the Toronto Blue Jays’ lead to one run in the bottom of the eighth inning.\n\nThe Dodgers clearly want Muncy to stick around, and if he can continue to produce how he has for the last several seasons at the plate, he’ll be an asset to the Dodgers’ title defense and three-peat aspirations.\n\nHow do you feel about Max Muncy’s extension?",

    "description": "The Dodgers agreed to sign infielder Santiago Espinal to a minor league deal on Monday after Tommy Edman got a bad injury update.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers agreed to sign infielder Santiago Espinal to a minor league deal on Monday, adding depth to the team as position players start reporting to Spring Training.\n\nThe Dodgers revealed that utility player Tommy Edman will not be ready to go for Opening Day, eliminating an infield piece from the roster outlook.\n\n“Tommy certainly won’t be ready for Opening Day,” manager Dave Roberts said. “He took some swings a couple days ago, both sides, he did some skipping, some light jogging, I think it was.\n\n“Getting his body into baseball shape. Obviously, he’s not going to be ready for the start of camp and he’s in that same bucket of ‘when he’s ready he’s ready.’ Each day there’s progress.”\n\nWhen healthy, Edman is counted on to be the starting second baseman who can fill in all across the field, though especially filling in at center field due to his range and mobility.\n\nWith him out of the picture, at least to start the year, the Dodgers signed Santatio Espinal, a six-year veteran who has spent time with the Toronto Blue Jays and Cincinnati Reds, more recently.\n\nEspinal has played second base, third base, shortstop, and the outfield, providing the Dodgers with the same versatility as Edman.\n\nLos Angeles has long valued versatile players under the president of baseball operations, Andrew Friedman, who has added players like Kike Hernandez, Miguel Rojas, and Chris Taylor over the years, keeping them on for multiple years.\n\nEspinal could become the latest addition to become a veteran, versatile mainstay if he can turn things around as a hitter.\n\nGot an update on Tommy Edman. Dave Roberts said he won't be ready for Opening Day:\n\n\"He took some swings a couple of days ago. Both sides. He did some skipping. Light jogging. He's not going to be ready for the start of camp. Tommy certainly won't be ready for Opening Day.\" pic.twitter.com/bpojlp1yFb\n\n— Doug McKain (@DMAC_LA) February 16, 2026\n\nFor the first four years of his career with the Toronto Blue Jays, Espinal was above replacement level, even having two seasons worth 2.4 bWAR. In 2022, he made the All-Star team with Toronto; however, 2023 was a down year for the righty.\n\nThe Blue Jays chose to move on from him, dealing the infielder to the Reds for a pitcher. In two years with the Reds, he had -1.8 bWAR, hitting .245/.294/.322. His OPS+ was a measly 68, showing how poor his overall hitting was.\n\nIf he can play as he did in 2021 and 2022, Espinal could play a key role with the Dodgers and secure a spot in the postseason platoon, ready to step up in case of an injury.\n\nDodgers fans should be excited about his arrival, as his steady presence should provide stability until Edman is ready to play.\n\nEdman did not look right for long stretches last season as he dealt with the ankle issue, though Espinal buys him more time to recover and get healthy.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani’s English may be getting better, but he doesn’t plan on getting rid of his interpreter anytime soon.\n\nAt spring training in Glendale, Arizona, on Friday, Ohtani was asked by Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register if he would continue to need the services of Will Ireton, his interpreter.\n\nEarlier this year, Ohtani accepted his National League Most Valuable Player Award, and he gave his acceptance speech in English.\n\nThe two-minute-long address prompted Plunkett to wonder if Ireton “would soon be out of a job.”\n\nLucky for Ireton, Ohtani dismissed the idea.\n\n“I still need him because there might be some bullies out there that might give me some weird questions that I’m sure he can handle,” Ohtani said\n\nPlunkett added that Ohtani then gave him “the first side-eye of the spring.”\n\nOhtani may be coming off back-to-back World Series championships, but he’s not taking his foot off the gas.\n\nNot only is the squad going for what would be the first three-peat in nearly 30 years, but Manager Dave Roberts said he expects Ohtani to compete for the Cy Young Award.\n\nOhtani last received votes for the Cy Young in 2022, when he was still with the Los Angeles Angels, but at least one other MLB superstar thinks the two-way player’s pitching may be overhyped.\n\nBlue Jay Vladimir Guerrero Jr. said Ohtani “wasn’t that tough to hit” in last year’s World Series.\n\nWhile Ohtani struggled on the mound in his two games and gave up a big home run to Guerrero, he also struck the Toronto slugger out twice.\n\nAnd the World Series may have been an aberration for Ohtani on the mound. Earlier in the playoffs, he famously hit three home runs and struck out 10 batters in the same game, the first time an MLB player has ever accomplished that feat in the playoffs.\n\nAnd that performance made waves beyond baseball, with some calling it the best single performance by a player in any sport.",

    "description": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts specifically named Tanner Scott as the most impressive pitcher after his first bullpen.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts specifically named Tanner Scott as the player who looked the best during the Dodgers’ first day of spring training.\n\nScott joined the Dodgers ahead of the 2025 season on a four-year, $72 million deal, but struggled through his first season in L.A.\n\n“Tanner Scott looked fantastic,” Roberts said. “It’s one day, but the stuff, the delivery was as good as I’ve seen from him and that includes all of last year.”\n\n“…He had a lot of stuff going on internally, with his body, that we addressed at the end of the season, so I think that might have bled into some cleaning up of some mechanics, but the ball was coming out differently than I remember it.”\n\nThe Dodgers invested in their bullpen this offseason partly due to Scott’s shortcomings. If he can show All-Star-level stuff in 2026, the Dodgers could have one of the better bullpens in MLB.\n\nScott had a 1.75 ERA through 72 appearances before coming to the Dodgers, but didn’t show any sign of his past self during the 2025 season.\n\nHe had a 4.74 ERA through 61 appearances last season, converting just 23 of his 33 save opportunities in 2025. He had only blown six saves in his previous two seasons, and had never blown more than seven in a single year.\n\nScott missed out on the postseason entirely, spending the Wild Card series off the roster and undergoing a procedure during the NLDS which kept him out for the remainder of the postseason.\n\nAfter the Dodgers signed All-Star closer Edwin Diaz in Dec. 2025, Scott effectively lost his title as the team’s closer.\n\nRoberts also commented on how the Dodgers could use the left-hander in the coming season.\n\n“Yeah, exactly,” Roberts said when asked if Scott would be used in more matchup-centric situations. “Being able to use Tanner [Scott] in any inning is going to be good for him.”\n\nHe is still a capable reliever, and will certainly play a part with the Dodgers in the coming season.\n\nDo you think Tanner Scott will improve after his rocky 2025 year?",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers appear poised to begin the 2026 season with a six-man rotation, manager Dave Roberts said Friday.\n\nSpeaking at spring training in Glendale, Arizona, Roberts confirmed that the team expects to utilize a six-man rotation, as they did last year.\n\n“I think early, it’s hard to say it won’t be,” Roberts said, as reported by Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register. “How beholden we are to that, for how long, I don’t know.”\n\nLast year, the Dodgers rotated Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Shohei Ohtani, Tyler Glasnow, Emmet Sheehan and Clayton Kershaw.\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Gomes said after the season that the team was open to another year of the six-man rotation, and five of those pitchers are back with the team in 2026.\n\nPresumably, they’ll hold their spots, but who will fill in for the retired Clayton Kershaw?\n\nGomes previously said Roki Sasaki “absolutely” will be starting again after spending much of 2025 hurt or in the bullpen, where he found more success than he’d had as a starter.\n\nHow he bounces back after a roller coaster season has led to him being considered perhaps the team’s biggest mystery of the season.\n\nWhile it’s easy to assume Sasaki will take Kershaw’s spot in an otherwise unchanged rotation, Roberts wouldn’t confirm the starters.\n\n“It’s hard to say right now who those participants are. It really is,” he said. “But I do think that with the starting pitching depth we have, it makes sense as I sit here right now.”\n\nAs Roberts implied, only time will tell. Injuries, trades, performance and many other factors will come into play, and change could come swiftly.\n\n“How that looks, end of April? I’m not sure yet,” he said.",

I just don’t see that happening. Don’t see it happening.”\n\nCaswell referenced Roberts’ previous confrontations with the Padres, perhaps the most prominent of which occurred in June.\n\nRoberts was ejected from the June 17, 2025, game with the Padres after Shohei Ohtani was plunked in the leg with a fastball.\n\nThat struck batter came one inning after Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit, and Roberts confronted the umpire after he issued warnings to both teams.\n\nThree days later, Ohtani and Tatis were hit again, prompting the benches to clear.\n\nThat night, Roberts got into it with now-former Padres manager Mike Shildt, who later seemed to admit that Ohtani was hit in retaliation for the pitch that hit Tatis.\n\nDespite the friction with his predecessor, Roberts was complimentary of Stammen, noting that despite a lack of managerial experience, his San Diego counterpart is well-regarded in the baseball world.\n\nStammen spent the last six years of his career with the Padres, prompting the San Diego Union-Tribune to dub the move “outside the box but from inside the organization.”\n\n“I was surprised in the sense of, he hasn’t coached before, but not surprised with the respect he has in the clubhouse, the game, and being familiar with the organization. Great hire,” Roberts said.\n\nFor his part, Stammen has promised the Padres will be competitive with the Dodgers, which he described as a “great team.”\n\n“We’re going to compete,” Stammen told Foul Territory earlier this year. “No doubt about that. We’re going to give them our best shot. That’s what we’ll do every year, that’s what we’re going to do every year.",

He batted .295 last season, placing third in the NL, and made his fifth consecutive appearance in the All-Star Game.\n\nHaving topped the list last year, it wouldn’t have made sense to move Freeman from the top spot when his numbers improved from 2024. Freeman’s batting average, slugging percentage and OPS all increased from two seasons ago, and he also had more homers and RBIs in the same amount of games.\n\nAs the active hits, runs and RBIs leader, it’s hard to imagine anyone claiming his spot as long as he continues producing at the level he has been.\n\nFanGraphs Depth Charts projects a slight regression from Freeman heading into his 17th season, but believes he’ll match his 24 homers from 2025.\n\nThey project he’ll bat .284 with a .849 OPS, and finish the year with a 135 wRC+.\n\nIf Freeman can maintain these numbers, as he has for most of his career, he’ll surely place towards the top, if not at the top, of the first baseman rankings come next offseason.

Snell made a name for himself in the Pacific Northwest before he was selected in the first round of the 2011 MLB Draft.\n\nThe All-Star pitcher grew up a Seattle Mariners fan and said that he will always have love for his hometown. In addition, Snell added that he will attend the Super Bowl, which is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 7 at 3:30 PM PT. The game will be held in Santa Clara, California, at Levi’s Stadium, the home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe southpaw will now enter his second season in Los Angeles after he signed a five-year, $182 million contract. His deal includes a $52 million signing bonus and a conditional $10 million option for 2030.\n\nSnell touched on a handful of different topics at Fan Fest, including his availability at the start of the 2026 season. He shared with the media that the “plan” is to be ready for Opening Day.\n\n“I’ve been playing catch, been throwing. It feels good,” Snell said. “But I’m just going to take my time. Last year, I was rushing. I wanted to pitch so bad. But I’m going to take my time. The goal is to be ready Opening Day, but I’m going to take my time. I’ll know more once I’m [at Spring Training], throwing bullpens, pitching in games.”\n\nThe two-time Cy Young winner pitched an incredible 2.35 ERA in 2025, but was limited to only 11 starts due to left shoulder inflammation that kept him out for most of the season. Still, Snell played a pivotal role for the Dodgers in their quest for back-to-back titles.\n\nHe will do the same for L.A. in the 2026 season as they seek to become the first National League team to complete a three-peat.",

    "fullText": "The Athletics claimed infielder Andy Ibañez off waivers from the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday.\n\nThe Dodgers signed Ibañez to a one-year, $1.2 million deal in January, but designated the infielder for assignment to bring back Michael Siani off waivers from the New York Yankees.\n\nIbañez came into the squad as relief for second baseman Tommy Edman, who is recovering from surgery on his ankle after struggling with injuries in 2025. He is progressing well through his injury, though, so the Dodgers may have put Ibañez on waivers believing Edman will be ready for Opening Day.\n\n“The timetable is more just kind of as I progress. So, it’s kind of hard to to say exactly when I’ll be ready to, you know, hop back in a Major League game again,” Edman said at DodgerFest Saturday. “As of right now, this past week, I just took dry swings for the first time and then started my throwing progression again.\n\n“I got the boot off like two and a half weeks ago. The last two and a half weeks I’ve been working into walking and pushing off it more. I got into like light skipping this week. Hopefully jogging next this next week. So you know, that’s kind of where I’m at right now and each step along the way, it’s kind of just being patient and making sure I’m hitting all the checkpoints with with no discomfort. And everything I’ve done so far has felt really good.”\n\nWhile Ibañez certainly met the Dodgers needs positionally, the odds he saw substantial game time as the season progressed were low.\n\nIn addition to Ibañez, the Dodgers had plenty of players available at second base, such as Miguel Rojas and Hyeseong Kim, who provide comparable numbers on both offense and defense.\n\nWith the Detroit Tigers in 2025, Ibañez played 91 games and hit four home runs while recording 21 RBIs. He slashed .239/.301/.352 for a .653 OPS last season, and profiled as a slightly above average defender.\n\nWith Ibañez now off the squad, the Dodgers have one fewer option at a logjammed second base.\n\nWho do you want to see at second come Opening Day?",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers relief pitcher Tanner Scott revealed he wants L.A. to re-sign reliever Evan Phillips.\n\nThe Dodgers non-tendered the veteran reliever earlier in the offseason due to the injury he sustained. Rather than paying him for a whole season — which he wouldn’t pitch much in after undergoing Tommy John surgery — the Dodgers released him into the free agency pool.\n\n“I do talk to Evan quite often,” Scott said at DodgerFest on Saturday. “I mean, we’ll see where it goes. I like the guy and hope he comes back.”\n\nPhillips and Scott had history before the Dodgers, playing together on the Baltimore Orioles from 2018-20 and reuniting after the Dodgers signed Scott ahead of 2025.\n\nPhillips pitched just seven games for the Dodgers last season before his injury, but had a fantastic run to kick off the year. He didn’t allow a run through 5.2 innings pitched.\n\nThe Dodgers will certainly consider bringing Phillips back, as he is a great weapon to have in the bullpen.\n\nHe had a 2.22 ERA through 201 appearances with the Dodgers, and never allowed a run for the Dodgers in the postseason. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman addressed the idea of bringing him back earlier in the offseason.\n\n“We had a number of back and forth discussions with Evan and his free agent,” Friedman said. ” It is challenging with him coming off surgery so he is going to take some time and look to sign after he throws off the mound when his rehab allows. Evan has been a big part of our past success and we will continue the conversation about bringing him back. We respect that he is taking this time to decide what is best for him and his family.”\n\nEvery team in baseball could use an arm like Phillips, and the Dodgers would likely have a leg up on the rest of the league if they were to move for the right-hander later in the season.\n\nThe post Tanner Scott Wants Dodgers to Bring Back Free Agent Reliever appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Bobby Miller is looking to return in a big way after a couple of disappointing campaigns with the Dodgers.\n\nThe right-hander began his career with the Dodgers in 2023 and served an important role in the rotation, but has struggled to perform over the past two seasons.\n\n“That’s the motivation for me right now, to get back to how I was a few years ago,” Miller said at DodgerFest on Saturday. “I know it’s still in there, and there’s more than that as well.”\n\nMiller was the Dodgers’ best pitching prospect in 2023, ranking as high as No. 2 among all players within the organization.\n\nMiller made 22 starts in his rookie season, posting an 11-4 record with a 3.76 ERA. He pitched 124.1 innings that season, striking out 119 batters in that time.\n\nThe following season, an early shoulder injury kept Miller on the sidelines from April until June. Upon returning, Miller couldn’t quite produce the results fans saw in 2023. He had a 8.52 ERA through 13 starts, walking batters and allowing home runs at more than double the rate he did in the previous season.\n\n2025 didn’t go much better for Miller, as he had a 12.60 ERA through two appearances in MLB. He spent a majority of the season in Triple-A, where he had a 5.66 ERA through 35 appearances.\n\nHe took on a new role as a reliever in Triple-A, and will likely have to continue playing that role if he wants to make his return to MLB. The Dodgers have had issues with their staff staying healthy in the past, though, so if Miller can keep himself towards the top of the pack in Triple-A, he could get another shot in The Show.\n\nThe post Bobby Miller Looking For Bounce-Back Season in 2026 appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers are World Series favorites heading into the 2026 season, but how does the organization fare in the long-term?\n\nPresident of baseball operations Andrew Friedman spoke on how the Dodgers plan to maintain their success in the future.\n\n“Infusing young players over that time is going to be really important for us to be able to maintain (this level of success),” Friedman said to Jack Harris of the California Post.\n\nThe Dodgers have featured in the playoffs for the last 13 seasons and the team doesn’t plan on messing up that streak in 2026 and beyond.\n\nDespite coming off back-to-back World Series titles in 2026, the Dodgers have the second-best farm system in the league. Their organizational depth is what should carry the Dodgers’ success in the long-term, at least that’s what Friedman hopes for.\n\nThe defending champions have several young players waiting on the sidelines for their big league opportunity, and finding a place for them will be key with an aging Dodgers roster.\n\nThe league’s current CBA is set to expire Dec . 1 and the Dodgers’ recent signing of Kyle Tucker to a four-year, $240 million deal has reportedly infuriated MLB owners heading into the expected labor battle between MLB and the players’ union.\n\nThe Tucker deal has given team owners reason to push for a salary cap, and even if that goal isn’t achieved, the result could be harsher luxury-tax penalties.\n\nThe Dodgers would inevitably be affected by both outcomes as the organization has already paid more than double for every free agent they’ve signed this winter because of tax penalties.\n\nFriedman revealed there’s really no way the Dodgers can prepare for what will ensue.\n\n“There’s just so much unknown around that,” Friedman said. “I’ve now been through a lot of CBAs and have tried to get cute leading into a CBA. Like, ‘OK, this is where it might be going.’ (Right now), we have no idea. We are sitting in the cheap seats on that. So for us, it’s about, whatever the rules are, reading and reacting to it and doing everything we can within the rules to be as good as we can be.”\n\nMore news: Former Dodgers Catcher Austin Barnes Signs With Mets on Minor League Deal",

Most players move of shortstop at the age that Mookie started playing shortstop. It's one of the most incredible developments in baseball the last couple season.\n\n— Doug McKain (@DMAC_LA) January 31, 2026\n\nBetts spent most of his career in right field, becoming a Gold Glove winner at the position and regarded as one of the best defenders in the game.\n\nHis speed allows him to cover a good amount of ground, and his glove and fundamentals are sound overall. However, in 2024, Betts was forced to cover in the infield, moving to second base and moonlighting as a shortstop.\n\nBetts did not play up to his usual defensive standard despite having a good arm and experience fielding ground balls, leading him to move back to the outfield for the close of the season once others got healthy.\n\nEver the player looking for a new challenge, the former Red Sox player spent the 2024 offseason working on his fielding to play shortstop full-time.\n\nHe delivered a standout performance in 2025, becoming a Gold Glove finalist, cutting down on his mistakes, and making highlight plays, especially during the postseason.\n\nThe biggest barrier preventing older players from playing shortstop is the loss of athleticism that comes with age.\n\nIt is rare to see a player in their mid-to-late 30s still playing shortstop, though Betts wants to buck the trend.\n\nHe seems to do a good job of maintaining his body and retaining his athleticism, though Father Time remains undefeated, and he could suffer an injury or a natural decline that limits his range to get ground balls.\n\nRealistically, if he wants to stay in the infield, Betts could end up moving over to second base, where he also played.\n\nEven if he does not stay at shortstop for the rest of his career, Betts has already achieved a special feat, moving to shortstop in his 30s and thriving.\n\n“To go out there and play Gold Glove right field for years,” manager Dave Roberts said back in October. “And to be in the Gold Glove conversation this year, rightfully so, to playing the biggest of games, biggest of stages — it’s just never been done. It takes a special brain and talent to do it.”",

He went on to miss the entirety of the 2023 MLB season.\n\nThe World Baseball Classic runs from March 5-17, so no matter how Team Puerto Rico performs, Diaz should be back in time for the beginning of the Dodgers’ regular season.\n\nThe All-Star, who signed a three-year, $69 million deal with the Dodgers this offseason, will be a key part of the roster for the upcoming year, and will look to stay healthy throughout the tournament so he can help is new team come April.\n\nDiaz is entering his age-32 season and is coming off one of his best years in MLB in 2025. The right-hander featured in 62 games last season and pitched 66.1 innings, posting a 1.63 ERA while striking out 98 batters throughout the campaign.\n\nOther than Diaz, five Dodgers are currently slated to play in the WBC. Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Shohei Ohtani headline a stacked Team Japan roster heading into the tournament as they look for their second consecutive title.\n\nWill Smith will play catcher for Team USA in the tournament and will pair up with a familiar face in Clayton Kershaw, who shockingly announced his participation after retiring at the end of the 2025 MLB season.\n\nThe final player who has declared for the WBC is Hyeseong Kim, who will play for Team Korea.\n\nMore Dodgers can still feature in the upcoming tournament, though, as teams will announce their full rosters Thursday at 4:00 p.m. PT.",

    "fullText": "Left-handed pitcher Cole Irvin agreed to a minor-league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday. The deal includes an invitation to big-league Spring Training. Irvin returns to MLB (spring training, at least) after spending the 2024 season bouncing between organizations. He then ultimately went overseas.\n\nThis move gives the Dodgers some organizational pitching depth as they sort through their options ahead of the 2026 season, looking for a third straight World Series title.\n\nIrvin last appeared in the majors in 2024 with the Minnesota Twins, where he had a brief stint. The lefty made four appearances for Minnesota, going 0-1 with a 12.27 ERA and two strikeouts across 3.2 innings. While that stint did not go well, it was just a small part of his career that has spanned multiple seasons and teams at the major-league level.\n\nThe Dodgers signed LHP Cole Irvin to a minor league deal with a spring invite, a source confirms to The Athletic. Has big league time with PHI, OAK, BAL and MIN before spending last year with the KBO’s Doosan Bears (28 GS, 4.48 ERA).@AramLeighton8 was on it.\n\n— Fabian Ardaya (@FabianArdaya) February 1, 2026\n\nAcross six MLB seasons, Irvin has logged 593 innings, tallying a 28-40 record with a 4.54 ERA and 434 strikeouts. He has appeared in 134 games (93 starts) and pitched for four different franchises during that stretch. His most notable run came with the Oakland Athletics, where he was a regular member of the rotation in 2021 and 2022, eclipsing 178 innings in each of those seasons.\n\nIrvin originally broke in with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2019 before spending time with Oakland and the Baltimore Orioles as his career progressed. His mix of starting and relief experience is part of what makes him a nice depth option for a Dodgers organization that often cycles pitchers between the majors and Triple-A throughout the season.\n\nIrvin most recently pitched overseas in the KBO with the Doosan Bears. He posted a 4.48 ERA over 144 2/3 innings while making 28 starts. That performance, while not incredible, helped put him back on the radar for the defending back-to-back champions.\n\nThe Dodgers and LHP Cole Irvin have agreed to a Minor League deal, sources tell @JustBB_Media\n\nIrvin, 32, spent last season in KBO with the Doosan Bears, where he pitched to a 4.48 ERA in 144 2/3 IP. Over parts of 6 MLB seasons (593 IP), Irvin owns a 4.54 ERA.\n\n— Aram Leighton (@AramLeighton8) February 1, 2026\n\nFor the Dodgers, Irvin is a low-risk depth option. He is not currently a projected roster piece. Los Angeles routinely stocks experienced starters on minor-league deals to protect against injuries and workload management across a long season, which could be especially important pending Blake Snell’s early-season availability. If Irvin shows enough during spring training, he could move between Triple-A and the big-league roster this season, but that would require a 40-man spot.\n\nAt 32, Irvin’s path back to major-league innings is not guaranteed, but the opportunity is a good one with the league's premier organization in the Dodgers.",

    "description": "Amid the talk about the Dodgers' spending, a special agreement between MLB and the Dodgers over L.A.'s TV money share has come up.",
    "fullText": "Amid the conversation about the team’s spending, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ TV deal with Spectrum has come up, namely, a special clause that allows the Dodgers to retain an additional portion of their TV revenue.\n\nThe signing of outfielder Kyle Tucker has sparked a total meltdown on social media, with fanbases from all over the MLB spectrum coming out of the woodwork and calling out the Dodgers for “ruining baseball.”\n\nTucker is set to earn $60 million per season, an incredibly high average annual value, which will have him among the highest-paid athletes in the sport. He is joining a team already full of stars in Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Freddie Freeman — the reigning World Series champions.\n\nAs a result, an agreement between the Dodgers’ owners, the Guggenheim Group, and MLB has begun to circulate.\n\nThe LA Times’ Bill Shaikin outlined the terms of the deal between MLB and the Dodgers that have indeed led to the team keeping a larger share of its revenue.\n\nWhile trying to oust Frank McCourt as an owner in MLB, the league blocked a $3 billion deal between the Dodgers and Fox Sports, prompting McCourt to file a suit in bankruptcy court.\n\nMcCourt was trying to sell the team for all its worth, and he needed to make sure bidders knew what to expect from a TV deal.\n\nIn bankruptcy court, MLB agreed that the fair-market value for the Dodgers’ TV deal was the Fox offer, meaning the league would take its 34 percent cut based on those terms.\n\nHowever, the Dodgers ended up striking a deal worth more than $8 billion, though MLB could not take more from the new deal.\n\nDuring an appearance on Dodgers Dougout with Doug McKain, Shakin explained how the deal materialized.\n\n“In a nutshell, in order to get Frank McCourt out, which was the objective from MLB, they had to make a deal with him in bankruptcy court,” Shakin said on the show.\n\n“And part of that deal was how are you going to value the television contract? And since a television contract did not exist at that time, because a new owner had not even been selected, they did the best they could.\n\n“And Guggenheim came out with a really great offer that I think blew even MLB’s wildest expectations away. MLB wasn’t thrilled, but they’re living by the terms of the deal, and that’s where we are.”\n\nA lot of people have been on the timeline complaining about the Dodgers “unfair TV deal”\n\nThe truth is even if the Dodgers gave up more of that money to other teams, opposing owners still wouldn’t spend ????\n\n(W/ @dmac_la) pic.twitter.com/f4wkjmBU4D\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) January 28, 2026\n\nMLB did try to push for new terms that hold the Dodgers to the same standard as other teams, but the settlement in bankruptcy court was too much of a blocker.\n\nHowever, as Shakin outlines, the Dodgers’ new owners, Guggenheim, did work with MLB to find a middle ground.\n\n“So in a normal situation, Major League Baseball would have said, this is a crazy high deal and good for you, and we’re happy, but we gotta share this money just like we share any other money.\n\n“And in this case, MLB could only push so far because Guggenheim was willing to work with MLB to a point. And then Guggenheim could have gone back to the court and said, ‘we got a deal, please, Mr. Judge, enforce the deal. That’s what you’re here for.’\n\n“And the court, as they say in legal circles, has jurisdiction over the deal, which means they run everything.\n\n“So, MLB could have been stuck with the original settlement, which was not as favorable as what they got in the negotiations with Guggenheim.\n\n“Is it equal for all other teams? Absolutely not. Is it a competitive advantage for the Dodgers? Sure. Now, is it as big a competitive advantage as some people are making it? I don’t think so ’cause the contract itself is way more than the individual amount the Dodgers are saving every year.”",

    "title": "Shaikin: In these times, Jackie Robinson's team should not grace the White House",
    "description": "Jackie Robinson was a passionate advocate for social and racial equality, and the Dodgers going to the White House again would be incompatible with his legacy.",
    "fullText": "In 1970, two years before he died, Jackie Robinson spoke at his son’s high school graduation.\n\n“In a land where we declare that we have liberty and justice for all,” Robinson said, “it seems that slogan really means liberty and justice for all as long as you do and say what some people want you to do and say.”\n\nThose words ring uncomfortably true today.\n\nRobinson often spoke out on civil rights, challenging both political parties. If you visit the Jackie Robinson Museum, as the Dodgers did when the museum opened in 2022, you see displays on civil rights and economic opportunity and social justice before you get to the baseball showcases.\n\n“Jackie’s passion was civil rights and equality, and more so than baseball,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said then. “It was more of, baseball was just a vehicle for him to use his voice, which is pretty cool to see and actually pretty inspiring.”\n\nIn these perilous times, in which “indivisible” has been replaced by “you’re with us, or you’re the enemy within,” Robinson’s team will have the opportunity to celebrate its latest World Series championship at the White House.\n\nLast month in Minneapolis, two American citizens were shot to death on American streets by agents of the American government. In this fragile moment, I asked Roberts if he would feel comfortable visiting the White House as the manager of Jackie Robinson’s team.\n\n“For me, I stand by: I’m a baseball manager,” Roberts told me Saturday at the Dodgers’ fan festival. “That’s my job.\n\n“I was raised — by a man who served our country for 30 years — to respect the highest office in our country. For me, it doesn’t matter who is in the office, I’m going to go to the White House. I’ve never tried to be political. ... For me, I am going to continue to try to do what tradition says and not try to make political statements, because I am not a politician.”\n\nNeither was Robinson. In 1944 — three years before he broke baseball’s color barrier and 11 years before Rosa Parks — Robinson refused an order to move to the back of a bus. He was an Army lieutenant, prosecuted by a military court for insubordination and then acquitted.\n\nIn the wake of the killings of Renee Good and then Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, federal officials hurried to television cameras and social media accounts. None of the usual admonitions against leveraging tragedy for political purposes. No thoughts and prayers, even, just a rush to dehumanize the dead with labels such as “domestic terrorist” before any investigation.\n\nThe last words of Good, to one of those federal agents: “I’m not mad at you.” The last words of Pretti, to someone needing assistance: “Are you OK?”\n\nJackie Robinson: “The right of every American to first-class citizenship is the most important issue of our time.”\n\nAfter the killing of Pretti last week, the BBC exhaustively checked the claims of federal authorities against video evidence from a variety of sources: “None of the videos we have analyzed show Alex Pretti holding a gun. There is no available evidence that he was an assassin who tried to murder federal agents, no available evidence he intended to massacre law enforcement, nor that it was a violent riot, no available evidence that this was an individual who arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”\n\nIn Minnesota, the immigration sweeps proceed unabated. The Star Tribune reported Saturday of a local detention facility so overcrowded that a woman had been locked inside a bathroom with three men.\n\nIn a suburban Minneapolis incident captured on video, an agent tells a man he must produce citizenship documentation “because of your accent.”\n\nThe Huffington Post reported that four children from an elementary school in a heavily Latino suburb of Minneapolis had been shipped to a detention facility in Texas.\n\nThis is what America voted for. The “Mass Deportation Now!” placards at campaign rallies in 2024 were held high.\n\nYet a judge ordered one of those children released Saturday, blasting what he called the “ill-conceived and incompetently implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”\n\nJackie Robinson: “The most luxurious possession, the richest treasure anybody has, is his personal dignity.”\n\nThis is not something the Dodgers can dismiss as an out-of-town issue. Federal immigration agents operate in Los Angeles too.\n\nAnd, since Dodger Stadium has become a must-see Japanese tourist attraction in the Shohei Ohtani era, how much might tourism drop if Japanese citizens could be forbidden from entering the United States without sharing their social media history from the preceding five years and every personal and business email address from the preceding 10 years, as federal officials have proposed?\n\nJackie Robinson: “To build for leadership, one must base his standing on what is right, not what is expedient.”\n\nI asked Dodgers president Stan Kasten whether the team had decided to visit the White House.\n\n“I don’t have any news for you on that,” he said Saturday.\n\nTo skip the trip could be uncomfortable, but the Dodgers would not have to stand on a Washington street in protest, or issue a blistering statement. All they would need to do is decline a photo opportunity.\n\nThe Dodgers are free to make their own decision, of course. They’ll be in Washington for their first road series of the season, in the first week of April. Then they’ll return to Dodger Stadium, for the annual Jackie Robinson Day festivities.\n\nFor me, going to the White House would feel more expedient than right. If the Dodgers do go, they ought to skip the tributes to Robinson’s grand courage, since they would not have been able to muster up a fraction of their own.\n\n Delivered at the start of each series.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Dodgers added experienced bullpen depth by signing right-hander Ryder Ryan to a minor league contract ahead of the 2026 season.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers have continued to reinforce their pitching depth by agreeing to a minor league contract with right-hander Ryder Ryan, according to reports, with the deal including an $800,000 salary if he reaches the Major League roster.\n\nThe Dodgers have signed the brother of RHP River Ryan, Ryder Ryan, to a minor league deal, sources tell @TheAthletic.\n\nRyan was signed to the Pittsburgh Pirates, but spent 2025 in Triple-A, posting a 4.73 ERA in 72 IP.\n\nIf he makes the majors, he will earn $800k.\n\n— Adrian Medina (@AdrianMedina_16) January 30, 2026\n\nWhile the signing does not immediately impact the Dodgers’ crowded bullpen picture, it provides the organization with another experienced arm as spring training approaches.\n\nRyan, 30, is the older brother of Dodgers right-hander River Ryan and has pitched parts of two Major League seasons. He appeared with the Seattle Mariners in 2023 and the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2024, combining for 21 2/3 innings at the big league level.\n\nDuring that stretch, Ryan posted a 5.40 ERA, allowing 13 runs on 21 hits and 10 walks while striking out 19 hitters. Though his MLB sample size is limited, he has spent much of his professional career serving as reliable upper-minors depth.\n\nThe 2025 season saw Ryan pitch exclusively at Triple-A Indianapolis in the Pirates organization. Over 72 1/3 innings, he recorded a 4.73 ERA with a 19.7 percent strikeout rate and a 12.3 percent walk rate.\n\nThat campaign marked his fifth season at the Triple-A level, where he owns a career 4.42 ERA across more than 270 innings, highlighting his role as a durable reliever capable of handling a heavy workload.\n\nFrom a pitch-mix standpoint, Ryan relies primarily on a fastball-slider combination. His four-seam fastball and sinker both averaged around 93 mph last season and were used frequently, but his slider remains his primary weapon, accounting for nearly half of his pitches. He also mixes in an occasional changeup, giving him enough variety to navigate lineups multiple times in relief appearances.\n\nCracking the Dodgers’ Major League bullpen will be a challenge. Los Angeles enters the season with several established relievers locked into roster spots, limiting immediate opportunities for non-roster invitees. As a result, Ryan is likely to begin the year at Triple-A Oklahoma City, where he could provide valuable depth alongside his younger brother.\n\nGiven the Dodgers’ history of cycling arms throughout a long season, Ryan’s signing fits a familiar pattern. While he may not be penciled into a major role early, his experience and durability could prove useful as the organization manages injuries and workload over the course of the 2026 campaign.",

The reliever began the regular season on the injured list with a shoulder injury and transferred to the 60-day injured list at the beginning of May 2025.\n\nHe returned to the team the following month, but returned to the injured shortly after with a right knee injury. Kopech returned once again at the beginning of September, but re-aggravated his knee injury at the end of the season and missed the postseason.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Sign Brother of Current LA Starter to Minor League Deal\n\nThe right-hander joined the Dodgers at the trade deadline in 2024, switching to the National League from the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe 29-year-old made an instant impact after arriving with the Dodgers, and became one of their most important weapons out of the bullpen. He had a 1.13 ERA with L.A. in 2024, and maintained a 3.00 ERA during their World Series charge in the playoffs.\n\nEven though he struggled with injury last season, the right-hander still performed will in 2025. He had a 2.45 ERA through 14 appearances with the Dodgers last season.\n\nThe Dodgers have already reinforced their bullpen this offseason so re-signing Kopech is unlikely, but whichever team grabs him will get a high-quality reliever for the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers World Series Champion Linked to Yankees appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Dodgers stuck to their guns during their negotiations with All-Star outfielder Kyle Tucker, keeping their offer short-term.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers made it clear early in the offseason they weren’t looking to sign Kyle Tucker to a long-term deal, and stuck to their guns during negotiations with the All-Star.\n\nL.A. landed the slugger with a four-year, $240 million deal despite not having the largest sum of money on the table, speaking volumes about the winning culture the Dodgers have created over the past several years.\n\nPresident of baseball operations Andrew Friedman chalked up the decision to stay with a short-term contract cto making sure the team is as good in the future as they are now.\n\n“In the short term, it’s easy to take the core talent we have in place, the nucleus that we have, and say, ‘Anything we can add to that.’ You don’t want to be flippant about what we have right now in this moment in time,” Friedman said to The Athletic. “That being said, we have to try to balance it with three, four, five years out. As the guys that are currently under contract get out … infusing young players over that time is going to be really important for us to be able to maintain.”\n\nThe short-term deal is a smart move from the Dodgers if they want to make additions from their farm system, as Tucker turned 29 earlier this month. L.A. has the oldest position player core in baseball, but can balance it out as some of their older players leave with the league’s best farm system.\n\nTucker was easily the best bat available in free agency and will do wonders for the Dodgers’ offense in the coming season.\n\nThe four-time All-Star plugged the hole L.A. had in the outfield, and as one of the best players in the game, he will surely turn one of the Dodgers’ weaknesses last season into a strength.\n\nMore news: Former Dodgers Top Pitching Prospect on Trade Block\n\nTucker has hit 20 or more home runs in each of the last five seasons, also accruing more than 4.0 bWAR in all of them. His worst season of the bunch came in 2025 — he had 22 home runs and 73 RBIs through 136 games — but he still managed a .841 OPS and played through a hairline fracture in his hand for a couple of months.\n\nWith Tucker bolstering their star-studded lineup, the Dodgers will look to claim their third consecutive World Series title — becoming the third franchise to complete a three-peat.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts praised his team for their complete buy-in during the 2025 season.\n\nThe Dodgers won their second consecutive World Series title last season, and Roberts says club culture and morale made all the difference.\n\n“Not one time was I questioned on my decision-making [by the players], which in turn would question their commitment to the team,” Roberts said to Jack Harris of the California Post. “They all felt their time was coming. They all felt that their roles were really valued. I don’t think that any head coach or manager can say that.”\n\nThe Dodgers definitely have the stars to compete with the best, but some of the biggest moments of the season came from some of the less expected players on the roster.\n\nMiguel Rojas is the best example of this, as the veteran single-handedly saved the season for L.A. in Game 7 of the World Series with his game-tying home run in the top of the ninth inning.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Fan Favorite Set to Coach in NBA All-Star Celebrity Game\n\nThe general focus and culture of the team isn’t just helping players perform, though. It’s also attracting new faces to the Dodgers. All-Star closer Edwin Diaz revealed his brother Alexis, who played for the Dodgers in 2025, played a role in his move to the NL West.\n\n“I did talk to Alexis a little bit when the conversation was getting more close to sign with the Dodgers. He told me that they are really, really good organization,” Diaz said at his introductory press conference in December. “They treat every player like they are all really good players. And that was something I looked for. You know, he told me great things about the Dodgers and made it easy for me.”\n\nWith the level of belief and the Dodgers ability already, they have themselves set up for another successful campaign in the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers’ Dave Roberts Credits Team Commitment for Success in 2025 appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

The rosters for each team have yet to be finalized, so it has yet to be determined which celebrities Betts will coach.\n\nBetts is not only a four-time World Series champion, an eight-time All-Star and the 2018 American League Most Valuable Player. But he is also a talented multi-sport athlete with hobbies such as golf, bowling and basketball.\n\nHe was seen playing basketball with NBA veteran Chris Paul in December shortly after the Los Angeles Clippers cut the future Hall of Famer. Betts also hosts an annual “Mookie Betts + Friends Bowling Tournament” to help raise money for his 50/50 Foundation and recently played a round of golf with former United States president Barack Obama at Lakeside Golf Club in December.\n\nAfter coaching the Celebrity Game, Betts will report to spring training with the Dodgers before the team’s first spraining training game against the Los Angeles Angels on Feb. 21.\n\nBetts is coming off a strong season at shortstop, winning his first Gold Glove at the position in 2025. He and the Dodgers are looking to win a third straight World Series championship in 2026, and Betts will be a crucial part of achieving that feat.\n\nBetts has the most World Series championships of any active player in MLB.\n\nWinning another title would put Betts into an exclusive group of MLB players who have won five World Series throughout their careers.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles have a very exciting young baseball team, but last season they played far worse than expected, which led to Brandon Hyde being fired early on. During the managerial search for the right fit, the position was an attractive one given the talent on the roster. Ultimately, the Orioles decided to hire Craig Albernaz.\n\n“The Orioles’ search for a new manager is over. Baltimore has hired Cleveland associate manager Craig Albernaz to become its skipper, the club announced Monday,” MLB.com’s Jake Rill wrote.\n\nThe Orioles have had a huge offseason so far, even though most of their moves came at the start of free agency. Acquiring Pete Alonso was a major coup, alongside several other additions. With some names still left on the market, Baltimore could also pursue Framber Valdez.\n\n“Baltimore has already committed $195 million to four free agents -- Pete Alonso, Ryan Helsley, Zach Eflin and Leody Taveras -- ranking sixth in spending thus far. But general manager Mike Elias, entering the final year of his contract, has one more haymaker left: Framber Valdez. With Ranger Suárez landing $130 million over five years in Boston, Valdez projects to get around six years and $180 million -- a deal that would vault the O's past the Dodgers and Blue Jays as baseball's top free agent spenders,” ESPN’s Paul Hembekides wrote.\n\nAdding Valdez would be huge for the Orioles, bolstering their rotation significantly. Part of the reason his free-agent market has dragged on is the controversy over a questionable pitch-crossing incident.\n\n“Both Framber Valdez and César Salazar were brought into the manager’s office after the game. Valdez is said to have apologized to Salazar but said the cross-up was not on purpose,” JomBoy Media wrote.\n\nIf the cross-up wasn’t intentional, then Valdez has no character concerns, allowing the Orioles to pursue the World Series–winning lefty without hesitation. Baltimore is eager to return to the playoffs after their 100-win season just a couple of years ago.\n\nValdez would likely play a major role in that push, as the Orioles aim to rebound after a disappointing 2025. While only time will tell, this move would help Baltimore compete in a stacked AL East.",

The All-Star outfielder had previously worn No. 30 throughout his entire career, but chose a new jersey number after a conversation with Roberts.\n\n“It was a fun conversation that Tuck and I had,” the Dodgers skipper said at Tucker’s introductory press conerence. “It was just more of, Maury and I have just had such a great relationship. And one of the things that he was like, ‘Gosh, before I die, I hope—or when I die, I hope that no one else wears that number.’ And so, it’s really near and dear to me.”\n\nRoberts first joined the Dodgers as a fourth-year player after playing the first three seasons of his career with the Cleveland Guardians, where he wore No. 20.\n\nRoberts was traded to the Red Sox in the midst of this third season in LA. The outfielder became a key figure for Boston’s improbable World Series run in 2004, most notably for his stolen base in Game 4 of the 2004 AL Championship Series.\n\nWhile Roberts only played 45 regular season games for the Red Sox, he became a beloved figure in Boston as his stolen base represents the turning point for the organization’s World Series title.\n\nRoberts has a .266 career batting average with 23 home runs, 213 RBIs and 243 stolen bases. He accumulated a 9.1 career bWAR over 10 MLB seasons.\n\nWhile Roberts had a respectable playing career, he is regarded as one of the best managers in baseball. Roberts will end up in Cooperstown and has already cemented his legacy as the arguably the greatest Dodgers skipper in franchise history.",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times give their thoughts on the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the Rams, the LeBron James-Jeanie Buss rift and college football.",
    "fullText": "The fury over the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker makes me wonder who's shouting the loudest?\n\nCould it be desperate, unfortunate fans whose beloved teams are owned by inheritors, nepo families, or private equity bros who celebrate their glamorous assets?\n\nSo how about a new metric in the sports page to accompany the ranking of teams and players: ownership. Not simply by wealth, but wisdom, brains and commitment. And for fun let's call it the McCourt-Moreno Index.\n\nIt's time we hold the Marge Schotts of pro sports accountable for the franchises they mismanage.\n\nThere are some alarming implications to Bill Plaschke's \"If it blows up baseball, so be it.\" Perhaps he means that MLB should be reduced to a burning garbage heap with three teams atop — Yankees, Cubs and Dodgers — because they were the only ones who went into the TV business and peddled their services for billions in the three largest TV markets.\n\nMaybe he yearns to transform MLB into the NHL of my childhood, with six teams. That was OK if you lived in a shallow arc extending between New York and Chicago — not so good for everyone else.\n\n\"So be it,\" as Plaschke would say, but I can guarantee I won't be the only one who isn't watching anymore.\n\nNaturally Dodger fans are all excited about the signing of the $60-million-a-year All-Star right fielder, Kyle Tucker. But we're not going to be happy when Dodger Stadium becomes the first MLB ballpark with a two-drink minimum.\n\nAs everyone seems to be raving about the Dodgers' acquisition of Kyle Tucker, I note the following: There is another player who was recently signed by the Yankees for less money and less signing bonus than Tucker who had higher numbers last year in average, home runs and WAR. He also plays more positions. Hadn’t the Dodgers heard of Cody Bellinger? Bellinger as a Yankee will never feel right to me.\n\nAsk a Major League Baseball owner like Arte Moreno, who sells out his ballpark whenever the Dodgers come to Anaheim, and sees Angel broadcast ratings surge whenever his team plays the Dodgers, if he thinks the Dodgers are ruining the game.\n\nThe Rams won the battle of which team gets to lose to Seattle.\n\nThe NFL needs to clarify exactly what does and doesn’t constitute pass interference. There is no consistency as to how it's called with each official seeming to have their own definition of what constitutes pass interference. It has gotten to the point where it’s worse than major league umpires and their own definition of the strike zone. NFL, you need to clean this up because these are major calls that are ruining games.\n\nBill Plaschke finally wrote a column about the Lakers with which I agree. LeBron James is the past, Austin Reaves is the future, and $50 million will help the Lakers rebuild. Yes, it's really as simple as that.\n\nWith the Lakers defense costing them multiple games, reminiscent of the coach Mike (no D)'Antoni days, the only real interesting Laker news last week were the alleged Jeanie Buss comments about the King. They sounded like they were lines taken from a scene in \"The Godfather\" .... \"What have I done to make you treat me so disrespectfully.\" My opinion is that it \"was not personal and strictly business.\"\n\nWhen asked after each game how he'd celebrate another victory, Indiana's Curt Cignetti would say, \"With a beer.\" After guiding his team to an undefeated season, and then winning the national championship, I doubt the Hoosiers' coach will ever have to buy another beer again.\n\nLincoln Riley is officially on the clock. In two years Curt Cignetti took a woebegone college team, with nary a five-star player, to an undefeated national championship. Cignetti has proven that, even in the NIL era, coaching matters. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick …\n\nCurt Cignetti and Indiana football playing in and winning the national championship was a modern-day version of the movie \"Hoosiers\" and would have made coach Norman Dale (actor Gene Hackman) proud. Now the question is, can new UCLA football coach Bob Chesney and his 40-plus transfers be the second coming of Indiana? Only time will tell.\n\nKings president Luc Robitaille appears to be happy with the Kings' status quo that appears to be getting one point every game in an overtime or shootout loss. Should we start referring to him as Luc RobitailleandthenloseinOT?\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

While they wear different uniforms, respect is all the Diamondbacks shortstop has for the Dodgers superstar.\n\n“Ohtani’s my brother,” Perdomo said. “That guy is out of this league, Ohtani’s out of this league.” (Translated from Spanish to English)\n\nSep 25, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani (17) at bat in the seventh inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field. Mandatory Credit: Allan Henry-Imagn Images\n\nPerdomo shared a story involving the reigning National League MVP from last season, detailing an exchange that highlighted both competition and camaraderie. After picking up a few Japanese phrases from a team trainer, Perdomo approached Ohtani and asked him for a signed bat.\n\n“He understood,” Perdomo recalled. “And he said, ‘If I win and get you out.'”\n\nThe Diamondbacks ultimately won the game, with Perodmo hitting the walk-off hit in the victory against Los Angeles. Despite “losing” the bet, Perdomo continued to express his awe for Ohtani’s elite talent.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers pitcher Shohei Ohtani (17) throws to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first inning at Chase Field in Phoenix on Sept. 23, 2025. © Rob Schumacher / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nOhtani doesn’t just paint corners, but also has a blazing fastball that can hit 100 mph. With a mixed arsenal at his disposal, hitters are left guessing all the time.\n\n“I was shocked when Vladdy hit a home run against him, and Vladdy is Vladdy,” Perdomo said, referring to Toronto Blue Jays star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. “With runners on base, he’s quick to the plate. Your timing has to be quick.”\n\nPerdomo’s comments reflect the intersection of rivalry and admiration that has come to define Ohtani’s presence in MLB. Even as division rivals who play high-intensity games each year at Chase Field and Dodger Stadium, moments like these show how players balance competition with mutual respect through friendly banter and bets.\n\nAug 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Arizona Diamondbacks infielder Geraldo Perdomo scores in the first inning triple against the Cincinnati Reds at Chase Field. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nOhtani’s reach is global. Often portrayed as serious and businesslike, he continues to leave an impact far beyond the field. Even without frequent trips to the desert, being part of a story that connects Arizona to the Dominican Republic underscores how his influence stretches across cultures and borders.\n\nWhile Perdomo may not have his signed Ohtani bat — yet — his respect for the reigning NL MVP serves as a reminder that baseball rivalries often transcend competition and ultimately give way to admiration.\n\n“What Ohtani does, no one else does,” Perdomo said. “As long as he’s playing and keeps putting up the numbers he does, nobody’s going to win an MVP. No one.”\n\n‘His joy is back’: Suns’ Jalen Green makes his long-awaited return in Philly",

If we put in a limit of at least 40 innings pitched, then the Cardinals’ Matt Svanson, White Sox’s Mike Vasil, Blue Jays’ Braydon Fisher, Padres’ David Morgan, Marlins’ Cade Gibson, Rays’ Ian Seymour and Rockies’ Juan Mejia all have strong cases, with adjusted ERA+ marks well above the league average.\n\n“The 26-year-old Dreyer, though, is worthy of this particular brand of love because of the large workload (72 1/3 innings) and reliable relief work (1.05 WHIP, 2.86 ERA) he’s provided for a first-place Dodgers team that has a behemoth roster but has often been scrambling in the bullpen. Dreyer has a calmness that belies his inexperience.”\n\nMore news: What Dodgers Games Will Be on NBC Prime Time in 2026?\n\nDreyer’s dominance last season stretched into the postseason as well, with the left-hander making four appearances in the playoffs. He threw 0.2 scoreless innings against the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card round, then followed that up with a scoreless inning against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS.\n\nHe made two more appearances in the World Series, and didn’t allow a run through either of them.\n\nDreyer is sure to play a big part in a Dodgers bullpen which struggled to produce towards the end of 2025, and he will hope to have a similarly solid season in 2026 as the Dodgers look to win their third consecutive World Series title.",

    "fullText": "Dodgers expected to explore trades of two players amid Kyle Tucker $240M deal originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers continued to frustrate the Major League Baseball world with their surprising agreement with Kyle Tucker for $240 million over four years.\n\nIt's a ridiculous $60 million AAV deal for Tucker, but his addition does bring more than just a big bat for the Dodgers. With a full 40-man roster, the Dodgers need to clear a spot for Tucker.\n\nAccording to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, the Dodgers have two players they're planning to explore trades for in the coming days. But neither is Teoscar Hernandez. Instead, the Dodgers are planning to move on from a different player.\n\n\"The Dodgers, however, are more likely to explore deals for outfielder Ryan Ward, a career minor leaguer who last season was MVP of the Pacific Coast League at 27, or right-hander Bobby Miller, who has been a disappointment,\" Rosenthal reports.\n\nAcquiring Tucker is a great move for the Dodgers and should make them more than simply overwhelming World Series favorites. But his addition means the departure of one player from the roster.\n\nInstead of cutting a player or trying to find a way to get a player through waivers, the Dodgers are instead exploring trades this winter with Miller and Ward.\n\nOf these two, Ward makes the most sense as a trade candidate. The lefty-hitting outfielder doesn't have a role on the Dodgers going forward with the addition of Tucker to the outfield.\n\nAnd with Hernandez going nowhere, there's even less space for Ward on the roster. Moving on from him in a trade makes the most sense, especially since there's likely a team willing to take a chance on Ward in 2026.\n\nThe 27-year-old hit .290 with a .937 in the minor leagues last season, with 36 home runs, 122 RBIs, 16 stolen bases, and 31 doubles on 164 hits with 113 runs scored.\n\nMore: Kyle Tucker contract details: How much deferred money did Dodgers give new star?\n\nSome team out there is likely to have some interest in Ward, and the Dodgers' best bet would be to find a trade partner with the outfielder who now doesn't have a clear fit on the Major League roster.\n\nMiller, on the other hand, is a disappointing righty starter who has not lived up to his potential in the Majors. Over his 37 games and 36 starts, Miller has a 5.44 ERA with a78 ERA+.\n\nWhile he had a solid 2023 season, with a 114 ERA+, his next two seasons have been major disappointments. Miller being traded would hardly be a surprise, as the 26-year-old righty doesn't have a clear spot on the roster going forward.\n\nThe Dodgers are trying to trade Ward or Miller to clear a spot for Tucker, and both being dealt makes sense for the Dodgers. There's no guarantee a deal isworked out, but ideally for the Dodgers, they trade one of these players to make room for Tucker.\n\nMets offer to Kyle Tucker before Dodgers' $240 million deal revealed by former MLB GM\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nDodgers continue to frustrate all of MLB with major Kyle Tucker signing\n\nRed Sox get big trade update on Brendan Donovan amid updated rumors\n\nFormer Cubs, Twins All-Star utilityman to sign with Rockies on two-year deal\n\nMets get bad news on free-agent Cody Bellinger amid strong Yankees offer",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section give their thoughts on the Chargers' playoff exit, the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the, Lakers, Clippers and Chloe Kim.",
    "fullText": "If there’s an important playoff game for the Chargers to win, you can bet they’re going to lose. Such was the case again against New England.\n\nWhile having a decent enough defense, the offense was pathetic. And, yes, I know their offensive line was completely depleted. But, the 49ers were banged up as well. They lost George Kittle and still won.\n\nWell, there’s always “next season.” Unfortunately, those two words still haunt the Chargers and their fans.\n\nOnce again the Chargers flop in the playoffs.\n\nThis time much of the blame should be placed at the top with Jim Harbaugh. Perhaps he did not watch or was not aware of how many times in this year's playoffs teams had failed to convert on fourth down with disastrous consequences. The psychological effect on the team from failing to convert and put points on the board early was evident. He had a team without their top running back and a very weak offensive line yet chose to go for it.\n\nHopefully he will learn from this or maybe it is time for Harbaugh to join his brother in seeking new jobs.\n\nNothing wrong with the Chargers that a new OC with a game plan can't fix. Or is there?\n\nThanks for firing your OC Greg Roman. Loyalty is great but loyalty does not get you to the promised land. In two postseason trips, one touchdown to show for it.\n\nIt needed to be done for Justin Herbert & Co.\n\nThe Yankees won 27 World Series championships by being the best team money can buy. The west coast Yankees, aka the Dodgers, are now the best team money can buy. That's capitalism, baby!\n\nAs a Dodgers fan for a Joe DiMaggio-esque 56 consecutive seasons, I am happy to have Kyle Tucker in the Dodgers' outfield in 2026. Certainly, he will be an improvement over Michael Conforto, and allow Teoscar Hernandez to go back to left field.\n\nHowever, I find it perplexing that a player who appeared in only 78 and 136 games in 2024 and 2025, and who has had only one top 10 MVP finish (fifth in 2023) in his career, would be signed for a whopping average of $60-million annually. To earn that enormous salary over the next four seasons, Tucker should be considered the best player in baseball not named Shohei Ohtani.\n\nNewsflash! The Dodgers buy another superstar, cost be damned! I'm not a Dodgers fan. I'm a Baseball fan, witnessing an organization job a system that destroys parity and fairplay. So go ahead — hop aboard the Dodgers bandwagon for another championship. While baseball fans everywhere else throw up their hands in disgust and flock to the NFL.\n\nThe Dodgers' signing of Kyle Tucker for ridiculous money now ensures a (stoppage) after this baseball season. For everyone saying other teams could do the same thing, really? As much as anyone could love the Dodgers, this just takes away from the game.\n\nIf you’re mad at the Dodgers don't stop there — might as well don a cape and be super mad because MLB has no kryptonite against them.\n\nWe should not expect too much from the Lakers. We have the same offense ran by the Dallas Mavericks for Luka Doncic transplanted to L.A. Give the ball to Luka and everyone else stands around and watch. Who is teaching these guys defense?\n\nHow many more games do fans have to endure before the Lakers hire a coach who is a defensive specialist?

    "description": "When factoring in deferrals and luxury tax payments, the Dodgers are projected to pay nearly $120 million per year to put Kyle Tucker in right field.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers were the two-time defending World Series champions and the most expensive team in MLB history. And then they landed Kyle Tucker.\n\nMore specifically, they reportedly got the former Chicago Cubs star to agree to a four-year, $240 million contract, which is effectively the most expensive deal in MLB history on a per-year basis, when taking into account the deferrals in Shohei Ohtani's $70 million-per-year deal.\n\nIt is an outrageous development. The Dodgers needed outfield help, yes, but teams with a record payroll aren't supposed to go out and grab the most expensive guy on the market, on a deal even larger than expected. MLB has tried over the past several years to discourage its biggest spenders from making the game appear even more unfair, and the Dodgers are laughing at them through a megaphone purchased with Ohtani bucks.\n\nHow big does this make the Dodgers' payroll, which was the largest in MLB last season at $416.7 million per Spotrac? It's now reportedly down to approximately $413.5 million, according to Spotrac.\n\nThat might feel like counterintuitive because, y'know, $60 million-per-year outfielder. Here's why that's the case.\n\nThe Dodgers had an enormous payroll and just added another big contract, but they saw a considerable number of contracts move off the books after 2025. And none of those contracts were for their biggest stars.\n\nMichael Conforto ($17 million), Kirby Yates ($13 million), Chris Taylor ($13 million) Clayton Kershaw ($7.5 million), Kiké Hernández ($6.5 million), Michael Kopech ($5.2 million), Evan Phillips ($6.1 million), Tony Gonsolin ($5.4 million) and Austin Barnes ($3.5 million) made a combined $77.2 million and are now off the team via free agency, trades and non-tenders.\n\nHernández was the only one of those players who made a significant contribution to the Dodgers' World Series run. Using Baseball Reference's calculation of Wins Above Replacement, that nine-man group combined for 0.3 WAR in the regular season.\n\nThe Dodgers had also been spending modestly — by their standards — until the Tucker deal. Since the start of free agency, they had signed three players to major league contracts: closer Edwin Díaz (three years, $69 million), infielder/World Series hero Miguel Rojas (one year, $5.5 million) and infielder Andy Ibañez (one year, $1.2 million).\n\nLos Angeles was on track for a less expensive team until the Tucker deal. The team opted to go moderately more expensive in order to add Yahoo Sports' No. 1 MLB free agent.\n\nLet's just go ahead and list them real quick. Here is every Dodgers contract larger than $50 million total, without factoring in deferrals:\n\nShohei Ohtani: 10 years, $700 million\n\nMookie Betts: 12 years, $365 million\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto: 12 years, $325 million\n\nKyle Tucker: four years, $240 million\n\nBlake Snell: five years, $182 million\n\nFreddie Freeman: six years, $162 million\n\nWill Smith: 10 years, $140 million\n\nTyler Glasnow: five years, $136.5 million\n\nTommy Edman: five years, $74 million\n\nTanner Scott: four years, $72 million\n\nEdwin Díaz: three years, $69 million\n\nTeoscar Hernández: thee years, $66 million\n\nEvery contract except for Betts and Freeman has been signed since the end of the 2023 season.\n\nAs for deferred money, let's get into that.\n\nHere is that same list, with the money the Dodgers will reportedly be paying for those contracts after they're over.\n\nTeoscar Hernández: $23.5 million\n\nThat adds up to $1.081 billion, and that's not even every Dodgers contract on the books. Obviously, Ohtani is doing most of the work there.\n\n[Get more Dodgers news: L.A. team feed]\n\nWe should also make a quick note about deferrals. The popular conception is that teams who sign players to contracts with deferred money are kicking the can down the line and will someday have to come up with an enormous amount of cash. We celebrate Bobby Bonilla Day for a reason.\n\nHowever, the reality is more complicated than that. Under collective bargaining agreement rules, teams still have to put up \"deferred money,\" but that cash goes to escrow accounts instead of the players. Once in those accounts, teams are under strict regulations over what they can do with it, but they are allowed to invest the cash in low-risk vehicles.\n\nSo that $680 million the Dodgers will owe Ohtani after 2033? They'll have already put that money up, while enjoying interest and modest returns. That's not nothing when the total sum of money working for you is more than $1 billion.\n\nRemember that $413 million mark above? It's not the best representation of what the 2026 roster, as currently constructed, will cost the Dodgers.\n\nLast year, the Dodgers' CBT number was $417 million. For that number, the Dodgers had to pay a $169 million luxury tax bill, which was larger than the 2025 payrolls of 12 MLB teams. In total, the Dodgers paid $586.7 million for their championship roster.\n\nFor 2026, Spotrac projects that tax bill number to go down to $161.9 million, making the total cost around $610 million.\n\nHowever, what's ridiculous is their tax bill would have been around $99.1 million without the Tucker deal, which is rated at $57.1 million per year in CBT calculations due to the deferred money. Because overages are taxed at 110% at the Dodgers' level, Tucker alone will make the Dodgers responsible for $62.8 million in tax money in 2026.\n\nSo the Dodgers are basically paying $119.9 million to put Tucker in right field. Which is larger than the current CBT payrolls of the Cleveland Guardians, Tampa Bay Rays and Miami Marlins.\n\nYou might be wondering, how did we get here? How is there a team making the George Steinbrenner Yankees look like a scrappy underdog?\n\nThe Dodgers have a lot going for them structurally. They are the dominant team in MLB's second-largest market. They have the largest stadium by capacity in MLB. They have the largest TV deal in the sport. They have a fan base with considerable spending power.\n\nThat's why the Dodgers were spending big and winning 100 games per season under their current ownership group. But this level of financial bombardment, which has now yielded back-to-back titles?\n\nIt is not hyperbole to say that Ohtani's contract is the biggest bargain in all of sports, especially when considering the deferrals. The Dodgers don't make much money from his jersey sales or the broadcast of their games in Japan (MLB divides both of those revenue streams among the 30 teams, so the Cincinnati Reds will make as much money from an Ohtani jersey as the Dodgers), but Ohtani has given them the one international star in baseball, combined with a premium brand and seemingly inevitable winning.\n\nIn the way some call Harvard a hedge fund with a university attached, the Dodgers are a Japanese advertising firm with a baseball team attached. The team has so much cultural cachet in Japan it can name its price for on-field advertisements, and will be enjoying popularity in the world's third-richest country for generations.\n\nCombine that with the usual outlay of winning a World Series, which the Dodgers have accomplished twice in as many seasons with Ohtani, and there's nothing comparable on the landscape of MLB.\n\nThe Tucker contract is going to make a lot of fans angry. It's going to make some team owners angry. And so we come to the salary cap question.\n\nWith MLB's CBA up after 2026, many observers feel a labor stoppage is inevitable. MLB has already made it clear it wants a salary cap, which has been a non-starter with the MLB Players Association for decades.\n\nThe Dodgers' dominance has been treated as an endorsement for the salary cap, to level the playing field of an unfair game. The thing is, however, MLB quite likes when the Dodgers are good. And the Yankees. And all of its biggest teams. The league has seen great ratings over the past two years and the Dodgers are a major reason why.\n\nIt's fun for some to imagine the Dodgers being forced to sell their team off if MLB gets its way with a salary cap. However, the reality will probably be less than satisfying for the biggest Dodger haters, at least in the short term. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred wants to keep labor costs down, but he's also going to want the Dodgers to keep winning, to a reasonable degree.\n\nSo what does the Tucker deal mean for the bigger picture? Maybe not much, especially when the Dodgers bringing him in only brought their payroll up to 2025 levels. And it's hard to imagine the Dodgers haven't already thought up some plans depending on how the CBA negotiations go.",

    "description": "The Mets swung for Kyle Tucker, but the outfielder ultimately took the Dodgers' $240 million offer, and New York is now trying to figure out how to salvage their offseason.",
    "fullText": "Only a couple of hours after Steve Cohen tweeted that he was looking for signs of smoke, a Vatican-style reference to the Mets waiting for an answer from Kyle Tucker, the Los Angeles Dodgers stunned him and the entire baseball world by signing the slugger to a deal worth $60 million a year on Thursday night.\n\nSo it’s almost too easy yet…the question begs to be asked: does Cohen want this smoke?\n\nOr will he, like most other MLB teams now, hold his cards close to the vest and wait for the inevitable lockout and war over a salary cap that is coming after the 2026 season?\n\nIn short, the Mets probably thought they were raising the bar into rarefied air by offering Tucker, a very good hitter but hardly a superstar, $220 million over four years. And in some ways, they were. Only for the Dodgers to swat them aside almost dismissively.\n\nSuffice to say, Cohen did no further tweeting on Thursday night.\n\nAnd I’m not blaming him or the Mets for drawing a line at $55 million a year (their final offer) for Tucker, as absurd as that sounds.\n\nYet, getting outbid must still be embarrassing in a way to Cohen. He’s a man who’s accustomed to getting what he wants, after all, even if it means spending obscene amounts of money for art pieces to add to his renowned collection.\n\nAs the richest billionaire owner in baseball, Cohen was supposed to be the death of baseball, remember?\n\nYes, the irony here is that this is what most other owners in the sport feared when Cohen said at his very first press conference as owner of the Mets that he wanted to model his organization after the Dodgers, that he might use his billions to create a new Evil Empire in Queens.\n\nRemember, at the time, the Dodgers were indeed a model organization that consistently drafted and developed home-grown talent in a way that allowed them to challenge for a championship every year without blowing the roof off the payroll.\n\nNow it’s different, of course. Helped in large part by the Shohei Ohtani connection that has attracted other Japanese stars and his willingness to defer hundreds of millions of dollars on his $700-million contract, the Dodgers are now outspending the rest of baseball in a manner that may have made even the famously impulsive George Steinbrenner look like a piker were he still alive today.\n\nEvil Empire? More like King Kong at this point.\n\nStill, Cohen has the money if he wants to compete with the big, bad Dodgers. And none of this is to excuse the Mets for what has been an underwhelming offseason.\n\nAs it is, it’s hard to tell if their sudden all-out pursuit of Tucker was part of their plan all along or more of a realization they desperately needed a big-splash move as Mets fans showed their displeasure with their wallets.\n\nDid they suddenly decide they better find someone to hit behind Juan Soto so he wouldn’t walk 150 times next season?\n\nWouldn’t it just have been easier to give Pete Alonso the $150 million over five years? He had made it clear he was willing to ease into the DH role, so I’ll never understand why the Mets drew such a hard line there.\n\nThey were willing to go three years but not five? It just never made sense, considering their need for a right-handed power hitter. And whatever their intentions at that time were regarding Tucker, they left themselves vulnerable one way or another.\n\nAnd now, even if they change course and throw crazy money at Cody Bellinger, well, sure, he’d make them better in a lot of ways, but he wouldn’t fill the huge hole in the lineup behind Soto.\n\nSo it’s hard to see how they’re going to have anything resembling a championship-caliber offense, whether they go after Bellinger or not.\n\nAnd if they were truly going all-in on run prevention, the David Stearns buzzword from the moment the 2025 season ended, why haven’t they made the expected moves to upgrade their pitching?\n\nDominant starting pitching and a lockdown bullpen would always offer hope of beating anyone, even the Dodgers, in a short series in October, yet the Mets haven’t gone that route either.\n\nAll along, I’ve said it wasn’t fair to judge Stearns until the offseason was over. And who knows, maybe now he’ll go out and trade for Freddy Peralta and sign Framber Valdez, and suddenly the Mets will have a starting rotation that can indeed beat anybody, especially if Nolan McLean blossoms into the ace everyone is now expecting.\n\nBut lest we forget, Edwin Diaz is now a Dodger, too. And while I’m laying some of that on Diaz for seemingly wanting to take the easy route to winning a championship ring, the Mets put themselves in a position to let it happen by not locking up their closer before LA ever got involved.\n\nIn truth, the most logical move at this point for Cohen might just be to hold onto his chips, save his money for Tarik Skubal next winter, or whenever the sport is open for business again, while seeing what McLean, Jonah Tong, Brandon Sproat, Carson Benge, Jett Williams and other top prospects look like by mid-summer as the trading deadline approaches.\n\nI’m not saying the Dodgers are unbeatable. The Blue Jays were one hanging slider away from beating them in the World Series.\n\nBut it’s hard to see how the Mets, without dramatic pitching upgrades at the very minimum, can realistically compete with LA for a championship in 2026.\n\nAnd right now that’s on Stearns. You can blame the Dodgers all you want for blowing up the sport and setting up a salary cap fight not only between owners and players, but owners and owners as well.\n\nYet the Mets shouldn’t be sitting here in mid-January trying to figure out how to save their offseason. If Stearns’ plan was to let the market come to him in search of the best value, which seems to be his M.O., well, it sure looks to be backfiring to the point where desperation is now part of the equation.\n\nDesperation and the LA Dodgers, that is.",

    "fullText": "A baseball field under construction in Ontario will soon welcome the newly-designated Single-A minor league affiliate for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe general manager for the Ontario Tower Buzzers says ONT Field is nearly complete and will be ready come opening day on April 2, 2026.\n\n\"The city of Ontario wanted to do some bold moves,\" said general manager Allan Benavides. \"They built arguably the best minor league stadium in the whole nation, regardless of classification.\"\n\nBenavides recently gave Eyewitness News an exclusive look at the stadium's progress, including the high-tech locker room for the home team as well as the field suite located right next to the home team's dugout.\n\n\"These dugout suites are extremely unique. I have not seen them anywhere in minor league baseball,\" he said.\n\nThe stadium will offer approximately 6,000 seats and offer patrons entrance to games as low as $5 per ticket.\n\nOfficials with the city of Ontario said the facility will not only be an attraction for tourists, but it will also provide an entertaining venue for local residents.\n\n\"We already have so many amenities in Ontario,\" said Jennifer Hiramoto, the executive director of economic development for the city of Ontario. \"We have the international airport, we have the Ontario Mills, and we have the Toyota Arena.\"\n\n\"This is just another feather in our cap,\" she added.\n\nNot only will ONT Field pay homage to the nearby international airport, with gates named with words such as \"Arrival\" and \"Boarding.\"\n\nBut the video board and outfield walls are also designed to mirror what baseball fans see at Dodger Stadium in Elysian Park.\n\n\"Ontario Airport sits two miles behind the video board,\" said Benavides. \"We have an incredible view of the San Gabriel Mountains. It's just unbelievable.\"\n\nHiramoto said it's taken years for the city of Ontario to secure the partnership with the Dodgers and build the stadium, but she said the end is in sight.\n\n\"Ontario positioned itself to be the home to the Dodger affiliate,\" said Hiramoto. \"All we needed to do was buy 200 acres, sign a contract with the team, build a stadium and all the supporting infrastructure, and do it by April 2026... and here we are. We did it.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays were just one game away from winning the World Series in 2025, but the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately prevailed. Now, the Blue Jays could be forced to part ways with Bo Bichette in free agency, especially after he significantly boosted his market value during the World Series run.\n\n“Can confirm Bo Bichette has received interest from multiple teams who view him as a second baseman or third baseman, due to the presence of an established shortstop on those rosters. Further evidence that the World Series augmented his value in the marketplace,” MLB insider Jon Morosi posted.\n\nBichette delivered a strong performance in the World Series after missing time earlier in the postseason with a knee injury. Despite the setback, his bat remained productive on the game’s biggest stage, and any team that signs him will need to make a substantial financial commitment.\n\n“The key question facing Bichette's free agency is how teams will view him positionally. If a club is willing to stomach his shortstop defense, then the comparison to Willy Adames' agreement with the Giants (seven years, $182 million) is a good reference point. I'm going to assume that will be the case, at least in the short term. I'll add in some extra coin because of Bichette's age advantage and inflation. Seven years, $189 million ($27 million AAV),” CBS Sports’ RJ Anderson wrote.\n\nNow, it’s simply a matter of where Bichette will land in free agency. Sportsnaut’s Austin Konenski believes the Los Angeles Dodgers could be his next destination.\n\n“The Los Angeles Dodgers would make sense for Bichette if he ends up with a short-term deal with a high AAV. Los Angeles doesn’t have a strong everyday option at second base, so Bichette’s willingness to move position could open the door for a partnership. If so, the free-agent infielder could join the team that beat him in the 2025 World Series,” Konenski wrote.\n\nAdding Bichette would give the Dodgers another power bat in the lineup and further strengthen an already formidable roster. It would mark yet another postseason addition of a top-tier position player for Los Angeles.\n\nBichette joining the Dodgers would only increase their World Series odds after already entering the season as favorites. Such a move would also likely shift Tommy Edman into the everyday center field role.",

    "title": "Shaikin: Should Angels fans just give up and join the Dodgers bandwagon?",
    "description": "With all the issues the Angels are facing amid a long playoff drought, should their fans abandon the team and root for the Dodgers or some other team?",
    "fullText": "Christmas is three days away, and you’re running out of time to get a gift for the Angels fan in your life. How about a Dodgers cap?\n\nIf ever a winter posed a loyalty test, this one could. The Dodgers spent $69 million on Edwin Díaz, the best closer available in free agency, and another $2 million in championship parade costs. The Angels spent $2 million on a closer who put up an 8.23 earned-run average last season.\n\nNext year the Dodgers will try to become the first National League team to win three consecutive World Series. The Angels will try to end baseball's longest postseason drought at 11 years, still without much of a plan beyond rushing first-round draft picks to the major leagues while treading the financial waters until Anthony Rendon’s contract runs out.\n\nOn Sunday they missed out on Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami, who signed with the 102-loss Chicago White Sox. Of the Angels’ five acquisitions this winter, three did not play in the majors last season, and not because they are up-and-coming prospects.\n\nIf you’re an Angels fan and you’re sick and tired of this, should you reconsider your loyalty?\n\nJim Bowden believes you should.\n\nBowden, formerly the general manager of the Cincinnati Reds and Washington Nationals, serves as a baseball insider on several media platforms. On “Foul Territory” last week he suggested fans of small-market teams have an option that might be more constructive than getting angry.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, for instance, the owner would rather complain about the lack of a salary cap than spend enough money to build a winner around generational pitcher Paul Skenes.\n\n“You don’t have to be a Pirate fan,” Bowden said. “You can retire as a Pirate fan, or trade yourself to the Dodgers.\n\n“If you want to see your team win, right now the Dodgers have got the best chance to win a World Series again. As a fan, you can root for any team you want.\n\n“You don’t have to root for the team in your home city. You can see the Dodgers play in your home city. They’ll come into Pittsburgh and beat you.\n\n“If it bothers you that much, just become a Dodger fan. It’s fine.”\n\nThe Angels no longer operate as a large-market team, and their circumstances could get even more dire in the near future.\n\nOn Sunday, Sports Business Journal reported that the parent company of FanDuel Sports Network is in jeopardy of shutting down if it cannot complete a sale to streaming service DAZN. The Angels would not disappear from your screens and streams, but it likely would mean the Angels would take a big cut in local broadcast revenue for a second consecutive year.\n\nThe Dodgers’ bandwagon shows no sign of slowing. The Dodgers set a franchise attendance record last season. They offer stadium tours in English, Spanish and Japanese. They launched a fan club in Japan.\n\nSo, as a frustrated Angels fan, you could hop on that bandwagon. Or you could try another large-market team — say, the New York Mets.\n\nMets owner Steve Cohen is worth $23 billion, according to Forbes. When Cohen bought the Mets in 2020, he said this: “If I don’t win a World Series in the next three to five years — I’d like to make it sooner — I would consider that slightly disappointing.”\n\nThe Mets still have not won a World Series since 1986. On Friday he took to social media to criticize “the usual idiots misinterpreting a Post article on Mets payroll.”\n\nOn Sunday, given the Mets’ losses of Díaz and beloved slugger Pete Alonso in free agency, New York Post columnist Mike Vaccaro shot back, comparing Cohen to greatly unloved former owner Fred Wilpon in this adaptation of a Christmas carol: “Steve’s beginning to look a lot like Wilpon/Mets fans say ‘Hell, no!’/What’s the point in being so rich/And a ruthless sonofabitch/If you don’t spend dough?”\n\nThe concept of fan free agency — essentially what Bowden suggested — is not new. Every now and then some disgruntled fan will publicly disown his favorite team, then invite rival teams to suggest why he should support them. If you’re creative enough, rival teams will send you some free swag.\n\nThat level of desperation is what many Dodgers fans felt a decade and a half ago, when former owner Frank McCourt needed a loan to cover payroll, hired a Russian physicist who channeled positive energy toward the team and “diagnosed the disconnects” among baseball operations personnel, and disparaged as “un-American” the league’s refusal to approve a television contract that he said would have provided the revenue to keep the Dodgers out of bankruptcy court.\n\nIn 2011, the year McCourt took the team into bankruptcy, the Angels outdrew the Dodgers for the only time. The Dodgers fans did not bail on their team. They waited for better days.\n\nThat is where Angels fans are now — and, for that matter, where Pirates fans are too. Bowden’s suggestion that unhappy Pirates fans exhausted by the perennial futility try the Dodgers did not go over well in Pittsburgh. At the Pirates’ fan site Rum Bunter, Emma Lingan wrote: “Fandom isn’t a streaming subscription you cancel when the content gets bad.”\n\nThis year’s World Series was the best and most dramatic I ever covered. But the one that was the most fun was the 2002 World Series: the underdog Angels, the Disney team no one projected for a happy ending, rampaging through October and toppling giants. As The Times’ headline on the Game 7 victory put it: “Fantasyland!”\n\nIf you were there in 1982 and 1986, when the Angels had six chances to win one game to clinch their first World Series appearance — and lost all six — then you could have a greater appreciation of 2002. And, if you were there for McCourt bankruptcy, you can have a greater appreciation of Guggenheim majesty.\n\nSo get that Angels fan in your life an Angels cap. That fan will be able to wear that cap proudly one of these years, and all the tears will make the cap fit that much more snugly.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the Rams, Dodgers, UCLA and Mick Cronin, as well as the NBA Cup.",
    "fullText": "Once again, Bill Plaschke has literally jinxed another Southern California sports team with his proclamation questions regarding the Rams:\n\nWho’s going to stop the unstoppable offense?\n\nWho’s going to score on the persistent defense?\n\nWho’s going to outwit the coaching genius?\n\nI have the answers, and it's not just Seattle. It's their special teams, their defensive backs and it's coach Sean McVay's play-calling. Well, maybe the referees … but that's for another day.\n\nThanks again for the poison-pen article, Bill.\n\nJust four days after Bill Plaschke promised that the Rams would win the Super Bowl, the team blew a big lead and lost in a stinker to the Seahawks. Like my mother told me when I was a kid: Be honest, respect others, and bet against Plaschke — you'll win every time!\n\nCan we quit the Rams praise now? They can’t tackle anyone that gets past the line of scrimmage. Coach Sean McKay and defensive coordinator Chris Shula went into a shell as the Rams lost the game to the Seahawks and any chance of a long playoff run.\n\nHow many more times do we need to see Emmanuel Forbes chasing a receiver because of a blown coverage or missing an assignment and giving up a big play. The secondary is the weak link in the Rams defense and he’s absolutely a broken link. Chris Shula, please put someone else back there. The mascot Rampage would be a better choice than Forbes.\n\nBill Plaschke writes of the Rams: \"Who's going to score on the persistent defense?\" Maybe the Lions with 34 points?\n\nWilliam P. Bekkala\nWest Hollywood\n\nBill Plaschke's Rams encomium is puzzling. During the course of the game I watched, Detroit moved through the Rams defense like Sherman through Georgia. This was, at best, park football. The first team that exploits the Rams defense as the Lions did and consistently moves the ball on offense will defeat the Rams.\n\nJust when the Rams thought that they solved their kicking situation, they lost another game because of a missed field goal. After the game, they must have been kicking themselves.\n\nIt looks like the Bills are going to win the Super Bowl, because Plaschke wrote, \"The Bills? Not ever.\"\n\nThose who think what the Dodgers are doing is sound financial decision-making only have to look a little in front of their noses. The Dodgers have now committed over a billion dollars in deferred salary. What happens when that bill becomes due? They will commit another billion in the same buy-it-now, pay-it-later mode.\n\nOther teams can’t and shouldn’t follow this lead, which eventually fans pay for in higher prices for everything Dodger related. We will have their management to thank for the impending 2027 MLB labor stoppage and no baseball at that time.\n\nJust when you think that things could not possibly get any worse in Westwood, UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond adds five more years to Mick Cronin’s contract.\n\nKudos to the Knicks for apparently deciding not to hang a banner to signify their NBA Cup championship, despite not winning a title since 1973, whereas the Lakers have won 11 since that time. Hopefully new ownership of the Lakers will reverse course and take down the Lakers’ barren banner for their 2023 Cup championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are on their way to becoming a true dynasty after winning back-to-back World Series wins. If they want to secure their place in history, they need to make one more move that would make them legendary.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Christopher Kline, that move is one that’s been floated around a lot recently: trading for Detroit Tigers two-time Cy Young Tarik Skubal.\n\nMORE: Red Sox receive update regarding possible Ketel Marte trade, division rival enters the mix\n\n“Maybe the Detroit Tigers decide to let Skubal finish out his contract and focus all their efforts on winning in 2026, but there's strong incentive to cash in now. The odds of Skubal, a potential $500 million pitcher, re-signing next winter are practically zero. Meanwhile, the Dodgers offer an appealing collection of MLB-ready pitching (Emmet Sheehan, River Ryan, etc.) and up-and-coming bats (Alex Freeland, Zhyir Hope, Daulton Rushing, etc.). I'm not sure another team can outbid the Dodgers if motivated,” Kline wrote.\n\nKline followed up, saying that the Dodgers could also include an All-Star to immediately replace Skubal in the Tigers’ rotation, and this deal would be appealing to Skubal for personal reasons.\n\n“L.A. can also dangle Tyler Glasnow, himself an established, All-Star ace, to sweeten the pot or to replenish prospect depth in a separate deal. The Dodgers are one of the few teams that can operate with the confidence that re-signing Skubal is a realistic end goal. He won't find a better path to multiple World Series titles. He also grew up in California, so it's a homecoming of sorts,” Kline concluded.\n\nMORE: Padres predicted to trade for $15.5 million two-time All-Star ace, would create nasty 1-2-3 punch with Michael King, Nick Pivetta\n\nThis past season, Skubal won his second Cy Young in two years, posting a 13-6 record, a 2.21 ERA, 241 Ks, and a WHIP of 0.891 over 195 innings pitched. Combine him with Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell, Shohei Ohtani, and Roki Sasaki, and the Dodgers get the most mythical rotation of all time.\n\nFor most MLB fans, hopefully this won’t come true. For Dodgers fans, pray L.A. is as committed to winning as they say they are, and get to work on negotiations ASAP.\n\nProposed blockbuster Giants trade sees San Francisco land $6.5 million All-Star ace, would create incredible 1-2 punch with Logan Webb\n\nDiamondbacks predicted to make blockbuster trade for $53 million All-Star ace to temporarily replace Corbin Burnes\n\nRed Sox receive seemingly advantageous update regarding NPB superstar, possible Alex Bregman replacement",

    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

    "description": "One last look back at the winter meetings, and what might be next",
    "fullText": "Edwin Díaz was introduced at Dodger Stadium in a brief press conference on Friday afternoon, and will wear number three with the Dodgers. He’s previously only worn 39 in his major league career, but that number is retired in Los Angeles for catcher Roy Campanella. Díaz said he chose three in part because he and his wife have three kids.\n\n“I chose the Dodgers because they are a winning organization,” Díaz said on Friday. “I’m looking to win, and I think they have everything to win.”\n\nIn his analysis this week of the Díaz signing, Michael Baumann at FanGraphs wrote, “The Dodgers know better than anyone that Díaz is not a sure thing. But, like, he’s about as close as you can get.”\n\nFrom R.J. Anderson at CBS Sports: “No one is going to feel bad for Roberts, who just won his third World Series title as a manager, but his job should be a lot easier next season now that he has an obvious ninth-inning answer at his disposal in Edwin Díaz. … Weird things can happen with relievers — even those as good as Díaz — but Roberts shouldn’t have to do as much stressing about the game’s final outs heading forward.”\n\nSpeaking of Dave Roberts, the $8.1 million average annual salary of his contract that which runs through 2029 makes him the highest-paid manager in the sport, but Jeff Passan at ESPN points out that that’s still less than half of top head coaches in the NFL and NBA, and that many new managers hired this winter are only making around $1 million.\n\nRoberts in an interview with Japanese media revealed that Shohei Ohtani in 2024 made a “very, very big contribution” to help the mother of former Dodgers reliever Gus Varland get treatment for cancer. Anthony Solorzano at the Los Angeles Times has more, including the good news that Varland’s mother is now cancer free.\n\nThe Dodgers and Blue Jays met in the World Series, and have made and are poised to make impactful deals this offseason, too, writes Alden González at ESPN. Among the Dodgers’ interests reported by González was a Kiké Hernández return, plus trade targets Steven Kwan and Brendan Donovan.\n\nBrett Pill, who was a Dodgers minor league hitting coach and coordinator for the last six seasons, was hired Friday by the Colorado Rockies as their major league hitting coach.",

    "fullText": "Tarik Skubal is the talk of the MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando. The Detroit Tigers have a decision to make as Skubal enters free agency after the 2026 season. There have been rumors suggesting the Los Angeles Dodgers could be closing in on a trade for Skubal; however, those rumors have been shut down.\n\nThe “Skubal to Dodgers” rumors at the Winter Meetings are all smoke and “not real,” as reported by FanSided’s Robert Murray on The Baseball Insiders. As of now, it doesn’t appear that Skubal will be traded from Detroit, but if an offer blows away the organization, it could entice them to pull the trigger.\n\nThe Tigers want to keep Skubal and pursue a trip to the 2026 World Series, but more needs to be done. If Detroit keeps the back-to-back AL Cy Young Award winner, it needs to make moves to maximize the 2026 season. If not, the Tigers would be better off trading Skubal to maximize his value.\n\nSkubal would demand a very, very big trade package, and unless a team is willing to meet Detroit’s demands, it doesn’t seem likely to happen this winter. The Tigers need to pick a lane on Skubal, but for now, the rumors of a trade to the Dodgers don’t seem to have any legs.\n\nBaltimore Orioles sign Pete Alonso to massive five-year contract\n\nBaltimore Orioles discussing historic trade with Washington in 2025\n\nLatest MLB Rumors on Braves Caution, Reds-Marte, Mets-Alonso, Blue Jays Trade",

    "fullText": "For the second day in a row, the New York Mets have seen a beloved star agree to terms with another team.\n\nPete Alonso, the Mets’ all-time leader in home runs, has reportedly agreed to a five-year, $155m contract with the Baltimore Orioles. The news comes a day after the Mets’ long-term closer, Edwin Díaz, reached a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe 31-year-old slugger had been unable to find a long-term deal last season and returned to the Mets on a shorter contract, which he opted out of after this year’s World Series. While the Mets were interested in re-signing him they reportedly never made an offer once other teams were willing to offer longer, more valuable deals to the the first baseman.\n\nAlonso has spent his entire MLB career with the Mets, and last season broke Darryl Strawberry’s franchise record for home runs. He ends his Mets career with 264 home runs. He was also incredibly popular with the team’s fans due to his good-nature and power, earning the nickname Polar Bear. The Mets also lost another long-term popular player, Brandon Nimmo, last month in a trade with the Texas Rangers.\n\nAlonso had one of the best offensive seasons of his career in 2025 – he hit .272 with 38 home runs and 126 RBIs – but there are concerns about his defense, a weak point for the Mets, and base running, and the Mets appeared reluctant to give him a multi-year deal when they have already have Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor on expensive, long-term contracts.",

    "fullText": "The Mets lost closer Edwin Díaz to the reigning champions Dodgers, with the reliever agreeing to a three year, $69 million contract with Los Angeles and setting a new AAV record for relievers.\n\nThe Mets’ offer to Díaz was for three years and $66 million with some deferrals, though they expressed a willingness to improve the number.\n\nA few factors impacted the Mets’ ability to retain Díaz outside of the pure dollar amount at play.\n\nThe Dodgers’ deal with Díaz also includes some deferrals, about $4.5 million deferred per year.\n\nAnthony DiComo rounded up all the important bits of the Díaz signing and the fallout for the Mets.\n\nDevin Williams was surprised that Díaz did not return, and he expressed excitement at the opportunity to earn the closer role.\n\nDíaz wasn’t the only reliever the Mets lost, as Gregory Soto signed with the Pirates on a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nThe Mets also made an offer to Kyle Schwarber before he re-signed with Philadelphia, offering around three years and $120 million for the free agent slugger.\n\nStar free agent Pete Alonso will now take up more of the spotlight with Schwarber off the board.\n\nThe Mets are reportedly reluctant to go past three years with Alonso.\n\nAnd while the Mets remain interested in a reunion with Alonso, other options exist and remain in play for the team.\n\nDespite the blows taken by the Mets, David Stearns is still optimistic about the team’s offseason.\n\nStearns still understands why Mets fans are feeling frustrated, especially in the wake of how 2025 ended.\n\nJohn Harper wrote about whether Stearns has a plan fans should trust and what things might be other valuable parts of contract decisions other than pure player value.\n\nThe Mets are willing to listen to trade offers for All-Star starter David Peterson, though the price will be considerable.\n\nThe draft lottery was held yesterday, and because the Mets landed outside of the protected top ten picks, the Mets’ pick was docked ten spots and will be 27th overall.\n\nThe Mets and Starling Marte reportedly have mutual interest in a reunion.\n\nHaving spent years with the Mets, Tommy Tanous has been hired by the Rockies as an assistant general manager.\n\nMLB.com looked at the fallout in the wake of the Díaz and Schwarber signings, including where the Mets go from here.\n\nKyle Schwarber returned to the Phillies, agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract.\n\nHis contract is an anomaly in baseball, but Jayson Stark explained why it fits such an unique player.\n\nLeft hander Alec Gamboa and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league split contract with an invite to spring training.\n\nThe Red Sox also traded infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox landed the number one pick in the 2026 draft.\n\nAfter being traded to Detroit last season, Kyle Finnegan re-signed with the Tigers on a two-year contract worth $19 million.\n\nA Pod of Their Own was back with another episode.\n\nDecember 10th is a very busy trade day in Mets history, with three major trades taking place on this date.",
