    "fullText": "Tarik Skubal is the talk of the MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando. The Detroit Tigers have a decision to make as Skubal enters free agency after the 2026 season. There have been rumors suggesting the Los Angeles Dodgers could be closing in on a trade for Skubal; however, those rumors have been shut down.\n\nThe “Skubal to Dodgers” rumors at the Winter Meetings are all smoke and “not real,” as reported by FanSided’s Robert Murray on The Baseball Insiders. As of now, it doesn’t appear that Skubal will be traded from Detroit, but if an offer blows away the organization, it could entice them to pull the trigger.\n\nThe Tigers want to keep Skubal and pursue a trip to the 2026 World Series, but more needs to be done. If Detroit keeps the back-to-back AL Cy Young Award winner, it needs to make moves to maximize the 2026 season. If not, the Tigers would be better off trading Skubal to maximize his value.\n\nSkubal would demand a very, very big trade package, and unless a team is willing to meet Detroit’s demands, it doesn’t seem likely to happen this winter. The Tigers need to pick a lane on Skubal, but for now, the rumors of a trade to the Dodgers don’t seem to have any legs.\n\nBaltimore Orioles sign Pete Alonso to massive five-year contract\n\nBaltimore Orioles discussing historic trade with Washington in 2025\n\nLatest MLB Rumors on Braves Caution, Reds-Marte, Mets-Alonso, Blue Jays Trade",

Pete Alonso, the Mets’ all-time leader in home runs, has reportedly agreed to a five-year, $155m contract with the Baltimore Orioles.

    "fullText": "For the second day in a row, the New York Mets have seen a beloved star agree to terms with another team.\n\nPete Alonso, the Mets’ all-time leader in home runs, has reportedly agreed to a five-year, $155m contract with the Baltimore Orioles. The news comes a day after the Mets’ long-term closer, Edwin Díaz, reached a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe 31-year-old slugger had been unable to find a long-term deal last season and returned to the Mets on a shorter contract, which he opted out of after this year’s World Series. While the Mets were interested in re-signing him they reportedly never made an offer once other teams were willing to offer longer, more valuable deals to the the first baseman.\n\nAlonso has spent his entire MLB career with the Mets, and last season broke Darryl Strawberry’s franchise record for home runs. He ends his Mets career with 264 home runs. He was also incredibly popular with the team’s fans due to his good-nature and power, earning the nickname Polar Bear. The Mets also lost another long-term popular player, Brandon Nimmo, last month in a trade with the Texas Rangers.\n\nAlonso had one of the best offensive seasons of his career in 2025 – he hit .272 with 38 home runs and 126 RBIs – but there are concerns about his defense, a weak point for the Mets, and base running, and the Mets appeared reluctant to give him a multi-year deal when they have already have Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor on expensive, long-term contracts.",

    "fullText": "The Mets lost closer Edwin Díaz to the reigning champions Dodgers, with the reliever agreeing to a three year, $69 million contract with Los Angeles and setting a new AAV record for relievers.\n\nThe Mets’ offer to Díaz was for three years and $66 million with some deferrals, though they expressed a willingness to improve the number.\n\nA few factors impacted the Mets’ ability to retain Díaz outside of the pure dollar amount at play.\n\nThe Dodgers’ deal with Díaz also includes some deferrals, about $4.5 million deferred per year.\n\nAnthony DiComo rounded up all the important bits of the Díaz signing and the fallout for the Mets.\n\nDevin Williams was surprised that Díaz did not return, and he expressed excitement at the opportunity to earn the closer role.\n\nDíaz wasn’t the only reliever the Mets lost, as Gregory Soto signed with the Pirates on a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nThe Mets also made an offer to Kyle Schwarber before he re-signed with Philadelphia, offering around three years and $120 million for the free agent slugger.\n\nStar free agent Pete Alonso will now take up more of the spotlight with Schwarber off the board.\n\nThe Mets are reportedly reluctant to go past three years with Alonso.\n\nAnd while the Mets remain interested in a reunion with Alonso, other options exist and remain in play for the team.\n\nDespite the blows taken by the Mets, David Stearns is still optimistic about the team’s offseason.\n\nStearns still understands why Mets fans are feeling frustrated, especially in the wake of how 2025 ended.\n\nJohn Harper wrote about whether Stearns has a plan fans should trust and what things might be other valuable parts of contract decisions other than pure player value.\n\nThe Mets are willing to listen to trade offers for All-Star starter David Peterson, though the price will be considerable.\n\nThe draft lottery was held yesterday, and because the Mets landed outside of the protected top ten picks, the Mets’ pick was docked ten spots and will be 27th overall.\n\nThe Mets and Starling Marte reportedly have mutual interest in a reunion.\n\nHaving spent years with the Mets, Tommy Tanous has been hired by the Rockies as an assistant general manager.\n\nMLB.com looked at the fallout in the wake of the Díaz and Schwarber signings, including where the Mets go from here.\n\nKyle Schwarber returned to the Phillies, agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract.\n\nHis contract is an anomaly in baseball, but Jayson Stark explained why it fits such an unique player.\n\nLeft hander Alec Gamboa and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league split contract with an invite to spring training.\n\nThe Red Sox also traded infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox landed the number one pick in the 2026 draft.\n\nAfter being traded to Detroit last season, Kyle Finnegan re-signed with the Tigers on a two-year contract worth $19 million.\n\nA Pod of Their Own was back with another episode.\n\nDecember 10th is a very busy trade day in Mets history, with three major trades taking place on this date.",
