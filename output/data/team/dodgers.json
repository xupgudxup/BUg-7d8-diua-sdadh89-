Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays were just one game away from winning the World Series in 2025, but the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately prevailed. Now, the Blue Jays could be forced to part ways with Bo Bichette in free agency, especially after he significantly boosted his market value during the World Series run.\n\n“Can confirm Bo Bichette has received interest from multiple teams who view him as a second baseman or third baseman, due to the presence of an established shortstop on those rosters. Further evidence that the World Series augmented his value in the marketplace,” MLB insider Jon Morosi posted.\n\nBichette delivered a strong performance in the World Series after missing time earlier in the postseason with a knee injury. Despite the setback, his bat remained productive on the game’s biggest stage, and any team that signs him will need to make a substantial financial commitment.\n\n“The key question facing Bichette's free agency is how teams will view him positionally. If a club is willing to stomach his shortstop defense, then the comparison to Willy Adames' agreement with the Giants (seven years, $182 million) is a good reference point. I'm going to assume that will be the case, at least in the short term. I'll add in some extra coin because of Bichette's age advantage and inflation. Seven years, $189 million ($27 million AAV),” CBS Sports’ RJ Anderson wrote.\n\nNow, it’s simply a matter of where Bichette will land in free agency. Sportsnaut’s Austin Konenski believes the Los Angeles Dodgers could be his next destination.\n\n“The Los Angeles Dodgers would make sense for Bichette if he ends up with a short-term deal with a high AAV. Los Angeles doesn’t have a strong everyday option at second base, so Bichette’s willingness to move position could open the door for a partnership. If so, the free-agent infielder could join the team that beat him in the 2025 World Series,” Konenski wrote.\n\nAdding Bichette would give the Dodgers another power bat in the lineup and further strengthen an already formidable roster. It would mark yet another postseason addition of a top-tier position player for Los Angeles.\n\nBichette joining the Dodgers would only increase their World Series odds after already entering the season as favorites. Such a move would also likely shift Tommy Edman into the everyday center field role.",

    "description": "With all the issues the Angels are facing amid a long playoff drought, should their fans abandon the team and root for the Dodgers or some other team?",
    "fullText": "Christmas is three days away, and you’re running out of time to get a gift for the Angels fan in your life. How about a Dodgers cap?\n\nIf ever a winter posed a loyalty test, this one could. The Dodgers spent $69 million on Edwin Díaz, the best closer available in free agency, and another $2 million in championship parade costs. The Angels spent $2 million on a closer who put up an 8.23 earned-run average last season.\n\nNext year the Dodgers will try to become the first National League team to win three consecutive World Series. The Angels will try to end baseball's longest postseason drought at 11 years, still without much of a plan beyond rushing first-round draft picks to the major leagues while treading the financial waters until Anthony Rendon’s contract runs out.\n\nOn Sunday they missed out on Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami, who signed with the 102-loss Chicago White Sox. Of the Angels’ five acquisitions this winter, three did not play in the majors last season, and not because they are up-and-coming prospects.\n\nIf you’re an Angels fan and you’re sick and tired of this, should you reconsider your loyalty?\n\nJim Bowden believes you should.\n\nBowden, formerly the general manager of the Cincinnati Reds and Washington Nationals, serves as a baseball insider on several media platforms. On “Foul Territory” last week he suggested fans of small-market teams have an option that might be more constructive than getting angry.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, for instance, the owner would rather complain about the lack of a salary cap than spend enough money to build a winner around generational pitcher Paul Skenes.\n\n“You don’t have to be a Pirate fan,” Bowden said. “You can retire as a Pirate fan, or trade yourself to the Dodgers.\n\n“If you want to see your team win, right now the Dodgers have got the best chance to win a World Series again. As a fan, you can root for any team you want.\n\n“You don’t have to root for the team in your home city. You can see the Dodgers play in your home city. They’ll come into Pittsburgh and beat you.\n\n“If it bothers you that much, just become a Dodger fan. It’s fine.”\n\nThe Angels no longer operate as a large-market team, and their circumstances could get even more dire in the near future.\n\nOn Sunday, Sports Business Journal reported that the parent company of FanDuel Sports Network is in jeopardy of shutting down if it cannot complete a sale to streaming service DAZN. The Angels would not disappear from your screens and streams, but it likely would mean the Angels would take a big cut in local broadcast revenue for a second consecutive year.\n\nThe Dodgers’ bandwagon shows no sign of slowing. The Dodgers set a franchise attendance record last season. They offer stadium tours in English, Spanish and Japanese. They launched a fan club in Japan.\n\nSo, as a frustrated Angels fan, you could hop on that bandwagon. Or you could try another large-market team — say, the New York Mets.\n\nMets owner Steve Cohen is worth $23 billion, according to Forbes. When Cohen bought the Mets in 2020, he said this: “If I don’t win a World Series in the next three to five years — I’d like to make it sooner — I would consider that slightly disappointing.”\n\nThe Mets still have not won a World Series since 1986. On Friday he took to social media to criticize “the usual idiots misinterpreting a Post article on Mets payroll.”\n\nOn Sunday, given the Mets’ losses of Díaz and beloved slugger Pete Alonso in free agency, New York Post columnist Mike Vaccaro shot back, comparing Cohen to greatly unloved former owner Fred Wilpon in this adaptation of a Christmas carol: “Steve’s beginning to look a lot like Wilpon/Mets fans say ‘Hell, no!’/What’s the point in being so rich/And a ruthless sonofabitch/If you don’t spend dough?”\n\nThe concept of fan free agency — essentially what Bowden suggested — is not new. Every now and then some disgruntled fan will publicly disown his favorite team, then invite rival teams to suggest why he should support them. If you’re creative enough, rival teams will send you some free swag.\n\nThat level of desperation is what many Dodgers fans felt a decade and a half ago, when former owner Frank McCourt needed a loan to cover payroll, hired a Russian physicist who channeled positive energy toward the team and “diagnosed the disconnects” among baseball operations personnel, and disparaged as “un-American” the league’s refusal to approve a television contract that he said would have provided the revenue to keep the Dodgers out of bankruptcy court.\n\nIn 2011, the year McCourt took the team into bankruptcy, the Angels outdrew the Dodgers for the only time. The Dodgers fans did not bail on their team. They waited for better days.\n\nThat is where Angels fans are now — and, for that matter, where Pirates fans are too. Bowden’s suggestion that unhappy Pirates fans exhausted by the perennial futility try the Dodgers did not go over well in Pittsburgh. At the Pirates’ fan site Rum Bunter, Emma Lingan wrote: “Fandom isn’t a streaming subscription you cancel when the content gets bad.”\n\nThis year’s World Series was the best and most dramatic I ever covered. But the one that was the most fun was the 2002 World Series: the underdog Angels, the Disney team no one projected for a happy ending, rampaging through October and toppling giants. As The Times’ headline on the Game 7 victory put it: “Fantasyland!”\n\nIf you were there in 1982 and 1986, when the Angels had six chances to win one game to clinch their first World Series appearance — and lost all six — then you could have a greater appreciation of 2002. And, if you were there for McCourt bankruptcy, you can have a greater appreciation of Guggenheim majesty.\n\nSo get that Angels fan in your life an Angels cap. That fan will be able to wear that cap proudly one of these years, and all the tears will make the cap fit that much more snugly.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the Rams, Dodgers, UCLA and Mick Cronin, as well as the NBA Cup.",
    "fullText": "Once again, Bill Plaschke has literally jinxed another Southern California sports team with his proclamation questions regarding the Rams:\n\nWho’s going to stop the unstoppable offense?\n\nWho’s going to score on the persistent defense?\n\nWho’s going to outwit the coaching genius?\n\nI have the answers, and it's not just Seattle. It's their special teams, their defensive backs and it's coach Sean McVay's play-calling. Well, maybe the referees … but that's for another day.\n\nThanks again for the poison-pen article, Bill.\n\nJust four days after Bill Plaschke promised that the Rams would win the Super Bowl, the team blew a big lead and lost in a stinker to the Seahawks. Like my mother told me when I was a kid: Be honest, respect others, and bet against Plaschke — you'll win every time!\n\nCan we quit the Rams praise now? They can’t tackle anyone that gets past the line of scrimmage. Coach Sean McKay and defensive coordinator Chris Shula went into a shell as the Rams lost the game to the Seahawks and any chance of a long playoff run.\n\nHow many more times do we need to see Emmanuel Forbes chasing a receiver because of a blown coverage or missing an assignment and giving up a big play. The secondary is the weak link in the Rams defense and he’s absolutely a broken link. Chris Shula, please put someone else back there. The mascot Rampage would be a better choice than Forbes.\n\nBill Plaschke writes of the Rams: \"Who's going to score on the persistent defense?\" Maybe the Lions with 34 points?\n\nWilliam P. Bekkala\nWest Hollywood\n\nBill Plaschke's Rams encomium is puzzling. During the course of the game I watched, Detroit moved through the Rams defense like Sherman through Georgia. This was, at best, park football. The first team that exploits the Rams defense as the Lions did and consistently moves the ball on offense will defeat the Rams.\n\nJust when the Rams thought that they solved their kicking situation, they lost another game because of a missed field goal. After the game, they must have been kicking themselves.\n\nIt looks like the Bills are going to win the Super Bowl, because Plaschke wrote, \"The Bills? Not ever.\"\n\nThose who think what the Dodgers are doing is sound financial decision-making only have to look a little in front of their noses. The Dodgers have now committed over a billion dollars in deferred salary. What happens when that bill becomes due? They will commit another billion in the same buy-it-now, pay-it-later mode.\n\nOther teams can’t and shouldn’t follow this lead, which eventually fans pay for in higher prices for everything Dodger related. We will have their management to thank for the impending 2027 MLB labor stoppage and no baseball at that time.\n\nJust when you think that things could not possibly get any worse in Westwood, UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond adds five more years to Mick Cronin’s contract.\n\nKudos to the Knicks for apparently deciding not to hang a banner to signify their NBA Cup championship, despite not winning a title since 1973, whereas the Lakers have won 11 since that time. Hopefully new ownership of the Lakers will reverse course and take down the Lakers’ barren banner for their 2023 Cup championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are on their way to becoming a true dynasty after winning back-to-back World Series wins. If they want to secure their place in history, they need to make one more move that would make them legendary.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Christopher Kline, that move is one that’s been floated around a lot recently: trading for Detroit Tigers two-time Cy Young Tarik Skubal.\n\nMORE: Red Sox receive update regarding possible Ketel Marte trade, division rival enters the mix\n\n“Maybe the Detroit Tigers decide to let Skubal finish out his contract and focus all their efforts on winning in 2026, but there's strong incentive to cash in now. The odds of Skubal, a potential $500 million pitcher, re-signing next winter are practically zero. Meanwhile, the Dodgers offer an appealing collection of MLB-ready pitching (Emmet Sheehan, River Ryan, etc.) and up-and-coming bats (Alex Freeland, Zhyir Hope, Daulton Rushing, etc.). I'm not sure another team can outbid the Dodgers if motivated,” Kline wrote.\n\nKline followed up, saying that the Dodgers could also include an All-Star to immediately replace Skubal in the Tigers’ rotation, and this deal would be appealing to Skubal for personal reasons.\n\n“L.A. can also dangle Tyler Glasnow, himself an established, All-Star ace, to sweeten the pot or to replenish prospect depth in a separate deal. The Dodgers are one of the few teams that can operate with the confidence that re-signing Skubal is a realistic end goal. He won't find a better path to multiple World Series titles. He also grew up in California, so it's a homecoming of sorts,” Kline concluded.\n\nMORE: Padres predicted to trade for $15.5 million two-time All-Star ace, would create nasty 1-2-3 punch with Michael King, Nick Pivetta\n\nThis past season, Skubal won his second Cy Young in two years, posting a 13-6 record, a 2.21 ERA, 241 Ks, and a WHIP of 0.891 over 195 innings pitched. Combine him with Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell, Shohei Ohtani, and Roki Sasaki, and the Dodgers get the most mythical rotation of all time.\n\nFor most MLB fans, hopefully this won’t come true. For Dodgers fans, pray L.A. is as committed to winning as they say they are, and get to work on negotiations ASAP.\n\nProposed blockbuster Giants trade sees San Francisco land $6.5 million All-Star ace, would create incredible 1-2 punch with Logan Webb\n\nDiamondbacks predicted to make blockbuster trade for $53 million All-Star ace to temporarily replace Corbin Burnes\n\nRed Sox receive seemingly advantageous update regarding NPB superstar, possible Alex Bregman replacement",

    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

    "description": "One last look back at the winter meetings, and what might be next",
    "fullText": "Edwin Díaz was introduced at Dodger Stadium in a brief press conference on Friday afternoon, and will wear number three with the Dodgers. He’s previously only worn 39 in his major league career, but that number is retired in Los Angeles for catcher Roy Campanella. Díaz said he chose three in part because he and his wife have three kids.\n\n“I chose the Dodgers because they are a winning organization,” Díaz said on Friday. “I’m looking to win, and I think they have everything to win.”\n\nIn his analysis this week of the Díaz signing, Michael Baumann at FanGraphs wrote, “The Dodgers know better than anyone that Díaz is not a sure thing. But, like, he’s about as close as you can get.”\n\nFrom R.J. Anderson at CBS Sports: “No one is going to feel bad for Roberts, who just won his third World Series title as a manager, but his job should be a lot easier next season now that he has an obvious ninth-inning answer at his disposal in Edwin Díaz. … Weird things can happen with relievers — even those as good as Díaz — but Roberts shouldn’t have to do as much stressing about the game’s final outs heading forward.”\n\nSpeaking of Dave Roberts, the $8.1 million average annual salary of his contract that which runs through 2029 makes him the highest-paid manager in the sport, but Jeff Passan at ESPN points out that that’s still less than half of top head coaches in the NFL and NBA, and that many new managers hired this winter are only making around $1 million.\n\nRoberts in an interview with Japanese media revealed that Shohei Ohtani in 2024 made a “very, very big contribution” to help the mother of former Dodgers reliever Gus Varland get treatment for cancer. Anthony Solorzano at the Los Angeles Times has more, including the good news that Varland’s mother is now cancer free.\n\nThe Dodgers and Blue Jays met in the World Series, and have made and are poised to make impactful deals this offseason, too, writes Alden González at ESPN. Among the Dodgers’ interests reported by González was a Kiké Hernández return, plus trade targets Steven Kwan and Brendan Donovan.\n\nBrett Pill, who was a Dodgers minor league hitting coach and coordinator for the last six seasons, was hired Friday by the Colorado Rockies as their major league hitting coach.",

    "fullText": "Tarik Skubal is the talk of the MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando. The Detroit Tigers have a decision to make as Skubal enters free agency after the 2026 season. There have been rumors suggesting the Los Angeles Dodgers could be closing in on a trade for Skubal; however, those rumors have been shut down.\n\nThe “Skubal to Dodgers” rumors at the Winter Meetings are all smoke and “not real,” as reported by FanSided’s Robert Murray on The Baseball Insiders. As of now, it doesn’t appear that Skubal will be traded from Detroit, but if an offer blows away the organization, it could entice them to pull the trigger.\n\nThe Tigers want to keep Skubal and pursue a trip to the 2026 World Series, but more needs to be done. If Detroit keeps the back-to-back AL Cy Young Award winner, it needs to make moves to maximize the 2026 season. If not, the Tigers would be better off trading Skubal to maximize his value.\n\nSkubal would demand a very, very big trade package, and unless a team is willing to meet Detroit’s demands, it doesn’t seem likely to happen this winter. The Tigers need to pick a lane on Skubal, but for now, the rumors of a trade to the Dodgers don’t seem to have any legs.\n\nBaltimore Orioles sign Pete Alonso to massive five-year contract\n\nBaltimore Orioles discussing historic trade with Washington in 2025\n\nLatest MLB Rumors on Braves Caution, Reds-Marte, Mets-Alonso, Blue Jays Trade",

    "fullText": "For the second day in a row, the New York Mets have seen a beloved star agree to terms with another team.\n\nPete Alonso, the Mets’ all-time leader in home runs, has reportedly agreed to a five-year, $155m contract with the Baltimore Orioles. The news comes a day after the Mets’ long-term closer, Edwin Díaz, reached a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe 31-year-old slugger had been unable to find a long-term deal last season and returned to the Mets on a shorter contract, which he opted out of after this year’s World Series. While the Mets were interested in re-signing him they reportedly never made an offer once other teams were willing to offer longer, more valuable deals to the the first baseman.\n\nAlonso has spent his entire MLB career with the Mets, and last season broke Darryl Strawberry’s franchise record for home runs. He ends his Mets career with 264 home runs. He was also incredibly popular with the team’s fans due to his good-nature and power, earning the nickname Polar Bear. The Mets also lost another long-term popular player, Brandon Nimmo, last month in a trade with the Texas Rangers.\n\nAlonso had one of the best offensive seasons of his career in 2025 – he hit .272 with 38 home runs and 126 RBIs – but there are concerns about his defense, a weak point for the Mets, and base running, and the Mets appeared reluctant to give him a multi-year deal when they have already have Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor on expensive, long-term contracts.",

    "fullText": "The Mets lost closer Edwin Díaz to the reigning champions Dodgers, with the reliever agreeing to a three year, $69 million contract with Los Angeles and setting a new AAV record for relievers.\n\nThe Mets’ offer to Díaz was for three years and $66 million with some deferrals, though they expressed a willingness to improve the number.\n\nA few factors impacted the Mets’ ability to retain Díaz outside of the pure dollar amount at play.\n\nThe Dodgers’ deal with Díaz also includes some deferrals, about $4.5 million deferred per year.\n\nAnthony DiComo rounded up all the important bits of the Díaz signing and the fallout for the Mets.\n\nDevin Williams was surprised that Díaz did not return, and he expressed excitement at the opportunity to earn the closer role.\n\nDíaz wasn’t the only reliever the Mets lost, as Gregory Soto signed with the Pirates on a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nThe Mets also made an offer to Kyle Schwarber before he re-signed with Philadelphia, offering around three years and $120 million for the free agent slugger.\n\nStar free agent Pete Alonso will now take up more of the spotlight with Schwarber off the board.\n\nThe Mets are reportedly reluctant to go past three years with Alonso.\n\nAnd while the Mets remain interested in a reunion with Alonso, other options exist and remain in play for the team.\n\nDespite the blows taken by the Mets, David Stearns is still optimistic about the team’s offseason.\n\nStearns still understands why Mets fans are feeling frustrated, especially in the wake of how 2025 ended.\n\nJohn Harper wrote about whether Stearns has a plan fans should trust and what things might be other valuable parts of contract decisions other than pure player value.\n\nThe Mets are willing to listen to trade offers for All-Star starter David Peterson, though the price will be considerable.\n\nThe draft lottery was held yesterday, and because the Mets landed outside of the protected top ten picks, the Mets’ pick was docked ten spots and will be 27th overall.\n\nThe Mets and Starling Marte reportedly have mutual interest in a reunion.\n\nHaving spent years with the Mets, Tommy Tanous has been hired by the Rockies as an assistant general manager.\n\nMLB.com looked at the fallout in the wake of the Díaz and Schwarber signings, including where the Mets go from here.\n\nKyle Schwarber returned to the Phillies, agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract.\n\nHis contract is an anomaly in baseball, but Jayson Stark explained why it fits such an unique player.\n\nLeft hander Alec Gamboa and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league split contract with an invite to spring training.\n\nThe Red Sox also traded infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox landed the number one pick in the 2026 draft.\n\nAfter being traded to Detroit last season, Kyle Finnegan re-signed with the Tigers on a two-year contract worth $19 million.\n\nA Pod of Their Own was back with another episode.\n\nDecember 10th is a very busy trade day in Mets history, with three major trades taking place on this date.",
