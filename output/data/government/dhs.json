    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is suspending the TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs as a partial government shutdown continues.\n\nThe programs are designed to help speed registered travelers through security lines. Suspending them could cause headaches for fliers.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement that “shutdowns have serious real world consequences.” She also said that “TSA and CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts.”\n\nThe partial government shutdown began Feb. 14 after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach a deal on legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats have been demanding changes to immigration operations that are core to President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.\n\nDemocrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security criticized the decision about airport security.\n\nThey said on social media that the administration was “kneecapping the programs that make travel smoother and secure” and accused them of “ruining your travel on purpose.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic leaders say a proposal from the White House is “incomplete and insufficient” as they are demanding new restrictions on President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and threatening a shutdown of the Homeland Security Department.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement late Monday that a White House counterproposal to the list of demands they transmitted over the weekend “included neither details nor legislative text” and does not address “the concerns Americans have about ICE’s lawless conduct.” The White House proposal was not released publicly.\n\nThe Democrats’ statement comes as time is running short, with another partial government shutdown threatening to begin Saturday. Among the Democrats’ demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use-of-force standards and a stop to racial profiling. They say such changes are necessary after two protesters were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nEarlier Monday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had expressed optimism about the rare negotiations between Democrats and the White House, saying there was “forward progress.”\n\nThune said it was a good sign that the two sides were trading papers, and “hopefully they can find some common ground here.”\n\nBut coming to an agreement on the charged issue of immigration enforcement will be difficult, especially as rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were skeptical about finding common ground.\n\nRepublicans have balked at the Democrats’ requests and some have demands of their own, including the addition of legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nAnd many Democrats who are furious about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s aggressive crackdown have said they won’t vote for another penny of Homeland Security funding until enforcement is radically scaled back.\n\n“Dramatic changes are needed at the Department of Homeland Security before a DHS funding bill moves forward,” Jeffries said earlier Monday. “Period. Full stop.”\n\nCongress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated out from a larger spending measure that became law last week. That package extended Homeland Security funding at current levels only through Feb. 13, creating a brief window for action as the two parties discuss new restrictions on ICE and other federal officers.\n\nDemocrats made the demands for new restrictions on ICE and other federal law enforcement after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans suggested that new restrictions were necessary. Renee Good was shot by ICE agents on Jan. 7.\n\nWhile he agreed to separate the funding, Trump has not publicly responded to the Democrats’ specific demands.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said late last week that the Trump administration is willing to discuss some items on the Democrats’ list, but “others don’t seem like they are grounded in any common sense, and they are nonstarters for this administration.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries have said they want immigration officers to remove their masks, to show identification and to better coordinate with local authorities. They have also demanded a stricter use-of-force policy for the federal officers, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.\n\nAmong other demands, Democrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it’s verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nRepublicans have said they support the requirement for DHS officers to have body-worn cameras — language that was in the original DHS bill — but have balked at many of the other Democratic asks.\n\n“Taking the masks off ICE officers and agents, the reason we can’t do that is that it would subject them to great harm, their families at great risk because people are doxing them and targeting them,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday. “We’ve got to talk about things that are reasonable and achievable.”\n\nTennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty said on “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats are ”trying to motivate a radical left base.”\n\n“The left has gone completely overboard, and they’re threatening the safety and security of our agents so they cannot do their job,” Hagerty said.\n\nIn addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said last week, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have suggested they could separate out funding for ICE and Border Patrol and pass the rest of it by Friday. But Thune has been cool to that idea, saying instead that Congress should pass another short-term extension for all of DHS while they negotiate the possible new restrictions.\n\n“If there’s additional time that’s needed, then hopefully Democrats would be amenable to another extension,” Thune said.\n\nMany Democrats are unlikely to vote for another extension. But Republicans could potentially win enough votes in both chambers from Democrats if they feel hopeful about negotiations.\n\n“The ball is in the Republicans’ court,” Jeffries said Monday.",

    "description": "\"You don't have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.\"",
    "fullText": "The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.\n\nAccording to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.\n\n“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”\n\nFive hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.\n\n“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.\n\nThe subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.\n\n“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.\n\nAs DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.\n\n“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”\n\nWhen uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.\n\nWhen Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.\n\n“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”\n\n“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”\n\nMore on DHS: There’s Something So Embarrassing About Homeland Security’s New Drone Video That We’re Gonna Have to Sit Down for a Minute",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that demands made by Democrats for new restrictions on federal immigration officers are “unrealistic” and warned that the Department of Homeland Security will shut down next week if they do not work with Republicans and the White House.\n\nDemocrats say they will not vote for a DHS spending bill when funding runs out unless there are “dramatic changes” at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies in the wake of the fatal shootings of two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nThe Democratic leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, released an expanded list of 10 detailed proposals on Wednesday night for restraining President Donald Trump’s aggressive campaign of immigration enforcement. Among the demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use of force standards and a stop to racial profiling.\n\nCongress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump last week agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated from a larger spending measure and extended at current levels for two weeks while the two parties negotiate. The deal came after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans agreed that new restrictions were necessary.\n\nBut with nearly a week gone, a shutdown is becoming increasingly likely starting Feb. 14 as Republicans have been cool to most of the Democrats’ requests.\n\n“This is not a blank check situation where Republicans just do agree to a list of Democrat demands,” said Thune, R-S.D. “The only way to get reforms to ICE is to agree to a bill.”\n\nAs of now, Thune said, “we aren’t anywhere close to having any sort of an agreement.”\n\nIn addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., said he is “astounded to hear” Republicans say his party’s proposals were political or unworkable.\n\n“It’s about people’s basic rights, it’s about people’s safety,” Schumer said. If Republicans do not like the ideas, he said, “they need to explain why.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries, D-N.Y., have made several demands, including no masks for officers, judicial warrants and better federal coordination with local authorities. The list they released Wednesday added several new items, including a stricter use-of-force policy, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.\n\nDemocrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it's verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nThey also want an end to racial profiling, saying DHS officers should be prohibited from stopping, questioning or searching people \"based on an individual’s presence at certain locations, their job, their spoken language and accent or their race and ethnicity.”\n\nFor officers conducting immigration enforcement, Democrats say that in addition to officers taking off their masks and showing identification, DHS should regulate and standardize uniforms and equipment to bring them in line with other law enforcement agencies.\n\nSchumer called it a “gut check moment for Congress\" as the immigration enforcement operations have rocked Minneapolis and other U.S. cities. But Republicans were dismissive.\n\nWyoming's John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican senator, said the demands are “radical and extreme” and a “far-left wish list.”\n\nSen. Katie Britt, who is helping lead negotiations, said the list is “a ridiculous Christmas list of demands\" and warned that time is running out before the deadline.\n\n“I encourage them to talk to the White House,” she said. “We only have one week left.”\n\nThune has also encouraged Democrats and the White House to talk. It is unclear whether they are or whether Democrats would be willing to back down on any of their demands.\n\nSome Republicans have demands of their own, including adding legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said it is up to Republicans to ensure the government doesn't shut down because they are in charge.\n\n“The American people want this abuse to stop,” Murphy said.\n\nSome look to limit shutdown pain\n\nOther lawmakers are searching for options to prevent another partial shutdown.\n\nOne idea being floated is to essentially fund some of the other agencies within DHS -– the Coast Guard, airport operations under TSA and disaster assistance from FEMA.\n\n“Why not take that off the table?” said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, whose state is in need of FEMA funds from recent disasters.\n\n“If it doesn’t look like they can get it done,” he said about the immigration enforcement overhaul. “I really think they should look at a la carte funding of agencies.”\n\nSome Democrats have said they agree, but Thune said Thursday that splitting apart the DHS appropriations bill to single out ICE would “defund law enforcement.”\n\nSplitting the bill would mean essentially cutting ICE loose by allowing it to go without its routine federal funding because the agency already has such a robust budget from Trump’s tax and spending cut bill from last year.\n\nICE is expected to receive about $10 billion in the annual appropriations bill, a fraction of the $175 billion-plus for homeland security for the administration’s mass deportation agenda.",

But the fight over funding for the Department of Homeland Security is far from over.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a package of funding bills on Tuesday afternoon that will end the four-day partial government shutdown.\n\nIt's still not clear how DHS will be funded in the long run.\n\nFunding for the department runs out on Friday, February 13, and Republicans have yet to agree to changes to immigration enforcement that Democrats are demanding in exchange for supporting the funding.\n\nWithout an agreement, several government agencies will go unfunded, and if no bill to fund DHS passes for a long time, workers could miss paychecks.\n\nIt would also affect other agencies funded by the DHS bill, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Coast Guard.\n\nHowever, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection would be impacted less than other agencies. Republicans voted to give $75 billion for ICE and roughly $65 billion for CBP in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" in July.\n\nIn the wake of Pretti's killing, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer laid out three key demands on ICE:\n\nIn a Tuesday statement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries backed up those points, while also calling for an \"end to the storming of sensitive locations like houses of worship, schools, and hospitals.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear whether Republicans will agree to any of those demands, leaving open the possibility that Democrats won't support a future DHS funding bill.\n\nWhile that may not be an issue in the GOP-controlled House, it would allow Democrats to block the bill in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats but 60 votes are required to advance most bills.\n\nThe partial shutdown began on Friday, after Senate Democrats demanded changes to funding for DHS in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nThe House had already passed a package of spending bills that funded DHS, along with the Department of Defense, the State Department, the Treasury Department, and other agencies.\n\nSenators came together and agreed to negotiate changes, passing a new version of the spending package that extends DHS funding for only two weeks in order to give time for negotiations.\n\nBut that bill still had to clear the House again, and with the lower chamber not scheduled to come back into session until this week, funding for those agencies ran out at midnight on Friday.\n\nThis shutdown was only partial, affecting fewer parts of the federal government than the 43-day long shutdown that occurred in the fall.\n\nThat's because lawmakers have already passed bills to fund various parts of the government, including the departments that fund SNAP and WIC payments.",

    "fullText": "CEO Alex Karp hails ‘iconic’ financial results despite criticism over contracts with ICE and homeland security\n\nPalantir celebrated its latest financial results on Monday, as the tech company blew past Wall Street expectations and continues to prop up the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants.\n\nPalantir has secured millions of dollars in federal contracts amid Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. The multibillion-dollar Denver-based firm creates tech focused on surveillance and analytics, to be used by the government agencies and private companies.\n\nPalantir’s biggest US customer is the Department of Defense; it also works with the Department of Homeland Security, and the majority of its revenue comes from deals with the federal government. Palantir reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m.\n\nPalantir has drawn further criticism over its role in the government’s immigration agenda, since federal immigration officers killed two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nPalantir chief executive Alex Karp told CNBC in an interview Monday that Palantir helps protect sensitive data. “If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir,” he said. “Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with fourth amendment data protection.”\n\nThe company beat Wall Street expectations of $1.33bn with $1.41bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025. It reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 – which also surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.23 in EPS. The company’s stocks jumped about 8% in after-hours trading after the release.\n\nKarp described the company’s growth on an earnings call as “one of the truly iconic performances in the history of corporate performance”. He wrote in a letter accompanying the earnings report that the $1.4bn in revenue generated in last year’s fourth quarter marks a new record – a 70% growth rate over the same period the year before.\n\n“We did this while supporting, in critical manner, some of the most interesting intricate, unusual, operations that the US government has been involved in – many of which we can’t comment on – but were the highlight of last year and highly motivating to all of us at Palantir,” Karp said.\n\nKarp doubled down on his data protection claim on the call, arguing that Palantir’s work with the US government, including intelligence agencies, aligns with the fourth amendment and makes sure “every institution that uses (Palantir’s) products is doing it within conformity of the law and ethics of America”.\n\nData privacy advocates are not convinced. “Palantir tools are ICE’s digital henchmen,” said Will Owen, communications director at the non-profit, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, in a statement to the Guardian. “Their revenue may be up thanks to Trump, but no one is buying that they hold ICE accountable.”\n\nLast year, ICE awarded Palantir a nearly $30m contract to build ImmigrationOS, which makes it easier to pull information about immigrants from across government databases – regardless of the accuracy of those records. 404 Media recently reported on the existence of another tool created by Palantir for the federal government: Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (Elite).\n\nElite “populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a ‘confidence score’ on the person’s current address”, according to 404 Media. The program reportedly relies on address data from the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes Medicaid.\n\nWired reported last week that the federal government has been using Palantir’s AI tools to process immigration enforcement tips. Wired also reported that the health department has been using other Palantir AI tools to screen grants and job descriptions for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and “gender ideology”.\n\nPalantir has said there is no malicious intent in its work with the federal government.\n\n“To be absolutely clear, Palantir is not working on any master database project to unify databases across federal agencies,” read a company blogpost last week. “Palantir has not proposed the US government build a ‘master list’ for the surveillance of citizens, nor have we been asked to consider building such a system for any customer.”\n\nPalantir has described 404 Media’s claims about the Elite tool as misleading; the company says it is “used for prioritized enforcement to surface the likely addresses of specific individuals, such as those with final orders of removal or with high severity criminal charges”.\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” awarded DHS and ICE huge budgets to pursue the administration’s anti-immigrant policies, including $45bn for ICE to expand its detention capabilities.\n\nIn 2025, Palantir’s federal contracts almost doubled – and increased to more than $970m; this amount was distributed across the government, mostly to the defense department, but it also includes the DHS.",

It required 7-days’ warning for visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities being funded exclusively by the “Big Beautiful Bill” that Republicans passed last summer. That bill did not include the rider.\n\nCobb rejected the policy, crediting the lawmakers’ contention that it would be logistically difficult to segregate which expenses are being funded by which law.\n\n“Defendants’ declarant provides almost no details or specifics as to how DHS and ICE would accomplish this task in the face of the practical challenges raised by Plaintiffs,” wrote Cobb, an appointee of former President Biden.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a DHS spokesperson for comment.\n\nThe suit was filed by 13 Democratic members of Congress: Joe Neguse (Colo.), Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), Robert Garcia (Calif.), Lou Correa (Calif.), Jason Crow (Colo.), Veronica Escobar (Texas), Dan Goldman (N.Y.), Jimmy Gomez (Calif.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Norma Torrez (Calif.) and Kelly Morrison (Minn.).\n\nTheir latest push in court came after the lawmakers said they tried to visit an ICE facility in Minnesota three days after the fatal shooting of Renée Good by a federal agent.\n\n“The Court’s decision today to grant a temporary restraining order against ICE’s unlawful effort to obstruct congressional oversight is a victory for the American people. We will keep fighting to ensure the rule of law prevails,” Neguse, a member of House Democratic leadership, said in a statement.\n\nThe lawmakers are represented by American Oversight and Democracy Forward Foundation, two organizations that regularly back lawsuits against the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "The father of a 5-year-old boy who was detained by immigration officers and held at an federal facility in Texas denied government accounts Monday that he abandoned his son as the pair returned to Minnesota.\n\nAdrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecudador, told ABC News that he loves his son, Liam, and would never abandon him, disputing statements from the Department of Homeland Security, which alleged that Arias had left his child in a vehicle. He also said his son got sick while in federal custody but was denied medicine.\n\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Arias fled on foot before he was arrested, “abandoning his child.” She said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stayed with the boy.\n\n“The facts in this case have NOT changed: The father who was illegally in the country chose to take his child with him to a detention center,\" she said.\n\nMcLaughlin did not address Arias' statement that his son was denied medication while in custody.\n\nArias also said he was arrested unjustly and contended he was in the country legally, with a pending court hearing for asylum.\n\nThe comments come after a federal judge ordered over the weekend that the pair be freed. They were released Sunday and returned to Minnesota, according to Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas.\n\nThe family's arrest and release unfolded during President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration, which has led to daily protests that included the shooting deaths of two American citizens by federal officers. The president last week ordered his top border adviser to oversee the crackdown days after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan suggested that mistakes have been made, but he said agents would continue to enforce federal law and called on local and state officials to cooperate with federal officers.\n\nThe boy's detention drew outrage as images of immigration officers surrounding the young boy in a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack began to surface.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE did not target or arrest the boy, and she repeated assertions that his mother refused to take him after his father’s apprehension. His father told officers he wanted Liam to be with him, she said.\n\nMcLaughlin also said last month that the child was abandoned and that officers tried to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken into custody.”\n\nNeighbors and school officials said federal officers used the child as “bait,” telling him to knock on his house’s door so his mother would come out. DHS disputed that description.\n\nMarcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father.\n\nThe government said the boy’s father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has a pending asylum claim that allows him to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe vast majority of asylum-seekers are released in the United States, with adults having eligibility for work permits, while their cases wind through a backlogged court system.\n\nEcuadorians, who left in droves in recent years as their country spiraled into violence, have fared poorly in immigration court, with judges granting asylum in 12.5% of decisions in the 12-month period through September, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research organization based at Syracuse University.\n\nIn ordering the release of Liam and his father, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery blasted the administration, writing that the case had “its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”\n\nThe Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review’s online court docket shows no future hearings for Liam’s father.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump moved quickly this week to negotiate with Democrats to try and avert a lengthy government shutdown over Department of Homeland Security funding, a sharp departure from last year’s record standoff, when he refused to budge for weeks.\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated with the deal, raising the possible of a prolonged shutdown fight when the House returns Monday to vote on the funding package. But Trump's sway over the GOP remains considerable, and he has made his position clear at a moment of mounting political strain.\n\n“The only thing that can slow our country down is another long and damaging government shutdown,” Trump wrote on social media late Thursday.\n\nThe urgency marked a clear shift from Trump’s posture during the 43-day shutdown late last year, when he publicly antagonized Democratic leaders and his team mocked them on social media. This time, with anger rising over shootings in Minneapolis and the GOP's midterm messaging on tax cuts drowned out by controversy, Trump acted quickly to make a deal with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\n“Trump and the Republicans know that this is an issue where they’re on the wrong side of the American people and it really matters,” Schumer told reporters Friday after Senate passage of the government funding deal.\n\nThe crisis caused by Minneapolis killings\n\nSenators returned to work this week dealing with the fallout from the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers, as well as the killing of Renee Good in the city weeks earlier.\n\nRepublicans were far from unified in their response. A few called for the firing of top administration officials such as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, the White House chief of staff for policy. Most GOP senators tried to strike a balance, calling for a thorough investigation into Pretti’s killing while backing the hard-line immigration approach that is central to Trump’s presidency.\n\nBut many agreed that the shootings threatened public support for Trump's immigration agenda.\n\n“I’ve never seen a political party take its best issue and turn it into its worst issue in the period of time that it has happened in the last few weeks,” said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. “Some things have to change.”\n\nDemocrats quickly coalesced around their key demands.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said there “was unanimity” around core principles of enforcing a code of conduct for immigration officers and agents, ending “roving patrols” for immigration enforcement actions and coordinating with local law enforcement on immigration arrests.\n\nIt helped that Trump himself was looking for ways to de-escalate in Minneapolis.\n\n“The world has seen the videos of those horrible abuses by DHS and rogue operations catching up innocent people, and there’s a revulsion about it,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.\n\n“The White House is asking for a ladder off the ledge,” he added.\n\nAvoiding the painful politics of a shutdown\n\nRepublicans are also trying to promote their accomplishments in office as they ready for the November elections and the difficult task of retaining control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nBut the prospect of a prolonged shutdown shifted attention away from their $4.5 trillion tax and spending cuts law, the centerpiece of their agenda. Republicans had hoped the beginning of this year's tax season on Monday would provide a political boost as voters begin to see larger tax refunds.\n\nRepublicans are also mindful of the political damage from last year's shutdown, when they took a slightly larger portion of the blame from Americans than Democrats, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n“The shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,” Trump told Republican senators at the White House in November.\n\nOn a practical level, this funding standoff threatened to destroy months of bipartisan work, including long hours over the holiday break, to craft the 12 spending bills that fund the government and many priorities back home.\n\n“We saw what happened in the last government shutdown in regards to how it hurt real, hardworking Americans,” said Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “I don’t want that to happen again.”\n\nA two-week funding battle begins\n\nThe agreement reached this week, if passed by the House, would avoid a prolonged shutdown and fund nearly every federal department through the end of the budget year in September. But it would not resolve one of the most difficult issues for Congress and the White House: DHS funding.\n\nInstead of a full-year deal, funding for the department was extended for just two weeks, giving lawmakers little time to bridge the deep divides over immigration enforcement.\n\nDemocrats are pressing for changes they say are necessary to prevent future abuses, including requiring immigration agents to wear body cameras, carry clear identification, end roving patrols in cities and coordinate more closely with local law enforcement when making arrests. Many Democrats also want tighter rules around warrants and accountability mechanisms for officers in the field.\n\nThose demands have met stiff resistance from Republicans. Some are opposed to negotiating with Democrats at all.\n\n“Republicans control the White House, Senate and House. Why are we giving an inch to Democrats?” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., wrote on social media.\n\nRepublican senators said they would take the fight to Democrats by introducing their own bills, including restrictions on “sanctuary cities,” to show their support for Trump's policies. That term is generally applied to state and local governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\n\n“We’ve let the issue get away. We’re not leading. We’re trying to avoid losing rather than winning,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who held up the spending bills until Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to give him a vote on his sanctuary cities bill at a later date.\n\nThune acknowledged the difficulty of the next two weeks, saying there are “some pretty significant views and feelings.”\n\n“We’ll stay hopeful,” Thune told reporters about the upcoming DHS fight. “But there are some pretty significant differences of opinion.”",

    "title": "Donald Trump Skips Over Kristi Noem During Cabinet Meeting After She's Sidelined from Minneapolis ICE Operation",
    "description": "Noem's actions as homeland security secretary have been under fire following recent incidents with federal immigration agents",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump skipped over Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting\n\nTrump also made the rare move of refusing questions from the press following the meeting\n\nKaitlan Collins, CNN's chief White House correspondent, suggested that Trump's actions allowed the administration to avoid addressing recent DHS controversies from Minneapolis and heightened scrutiny about Noem's leadership\n\nPresident Donald Trump added more fuel to the rumors about Kristi Noem's job security during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Jan. 29.\n\nTrump's televised Cabinet meetings — where his top advisers take turns updating him on their departments' priorities — have become opportunities to tout the administration's achievements and comment on current events, however two notable actions by Trump prevented that from happening on Thursday, as many wondered how he would acknowledge the ongoing criticism toward the Department of Homeland Security and its controversial presence in Minnesota.\n\nThe federal immigration operation in Minneapolis has been a source of great backlash for the Trump administration, including with the fatal officer-involved shootings of American citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti; distressing updates about 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, whose ICE detainment while returning home from preschool with his father went viral; and the recent attack on Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was condemning DHS Secretary Noem at a town hall.\n\nWhile Trump called on many members of his Cabinet for updates on issues like housing, the economy, the ongoing situation in Venezuela and more during Thursday's meeting, CNN chief White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins was quick to note afterward that he skipped over Noem, preventing her from addressing the criticism surrounding her leadership of federal immigration agencies.\n\nTrump also ended the meeting abruptly and, in an exceedingly rare move for the 47th president, declined to take questions from the assembled members of the White House press corps.\n\n\"There have been a ton of headlines generated around Minneapolis, what's happening there, especially with the president changing his leadership there on the ground,\" Collins said on the air immediately after the event. \"That did not come up at all during this Cabinet meeting, and we were there for over an hour and a half.\"\n\n\"Not once was Minneapolis brought up, and obviously no questions were brought up to the president because he did not take questions, despite talking during the Cabinet meeting about how he believes they are the most transparent administration ever,\" she added.\n\nNoem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino both came under fire for comments made shortly after Pretti's death on Jan. 24, in which they labeled the 37-year-old ICU nurse a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\n\"This individual who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers committed an act of domestic terrorism,\" Noem said while speaking with reporters just hours after Pretti was shot and killed. \"That’s the facts.\"\n\nVideo footage soon revealed that Pretti was holding a cell phone, not a gun, and that Border Patrol agents disarmed him before shooting him at point-blank range.\n\nCalls for Noem's impeachment have come from both Republicans and Democrats; however, when asked on Jan. 27 if Noem would be stepping down, Trump answered simply, telling reporters, \"No.\"\n\nHe has, however, sidelined Noem and Bovino from the operation in Minneapolis. In a Jan. 26 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he was sending his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, to be his new point person on the ground in the embattled city.\n\n\"I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,\" Trump, 79, wrote. \"He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.\"\n\nThe following day, The Atlantic reported that Bovino will return to his Border Patrol post in El Centro, Calif., where he is Commander Op At Large of that sector.\n\nCBS News also reported on Jan. 27 that Noem is unlikely to lose her Cabinet position outright, but is expected to shift her focus away from Minneapolis to \"securing the southern border and other priorities.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn Jan. 27, Axios reported that Noem was mounting a defense amid the growing scrutiny, reportedly placing the blame for any DHS missteps on Trump and his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.\n\n\"Everything I've done, I've done at the direction of the president and Stephen,\" Noem reportedly said, according to a person who relayed the quote to Axios.",

    "fullText": "A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans.\n\nThe decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.\n\nAn email late Wednesday night to the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.\n\nA federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day now on a request to pause the termination of TPS for Haiti while a separate lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The country’s TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3.\n\nNinth Circuit Judges Kim Wardlaw, Salvador Mendoza, Jr. and Anthony Johnstone said in Wednesday's ruling that the TPS legislation passed by Congress did not give the secretary the power to vacate an existing TPS designation. All three judges were nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\n“The statute contains numerous procedural safeguards that ensure individuals with TPS enjoy predictability and stability during periods of extraordinary and temporary conditions in their home country,” Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the panel.\n\nWardlaw said Noem's “unlawful actions have had real and significant consequences” for Venezuelans and Haitians in the United States who rely on TPS.\n\n“The record is replete with examples of hard-working, contributing members of society — who are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and partners of U.S. citizens, pay taxes, and have no criminal records — who have been deported or detained after losing their TPS,” she wrote.\n\nTemporary Protected Status, or TPS, authorized by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, allows the Homeland Security secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country.\n\nDesignations are granted for terms of six, 12 or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work, but it does not give them a path to citizenship.\n\nIn ending the protections, Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow immigrants from the two countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.\n\nMillions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.\n\nHaiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.\n\nMendoza wrote separately that there was “ample evidence of racial and national origin animus” that reinforced the lower court's conclusion that Noem's decisions were “preordained and her reasoning pretextual.”\n\n“It is clear that the Secretary’s vacatur actions were not actually grounded in substantive policy considerations or genuine differences with respect to the prior administration’s TPS procedures, but were instead rooted in a stereotype-based diagnosis of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti as dangerous criminals or mentally unwell,” he wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the government have argued the secretary has clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program and those decisions are not subject to judicial review. They have also denied that her actions were motived by racial animus.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Two federal officers fired shots during the encounter that killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis, a Customs and Border Protection official told Congress in a notice sent Tuesday, while Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs filed an objection saying immigration agents tried to enter the country's consulate in the city without permission.\n\nOfficers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle, according to a notification to Congress obtained by The Associated Press. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.\n\nA Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said.\n\nInvestigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.\n\nSeparately, a man was arrested after he sprayed an unknown liquid at U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was speaking at a town hall meeting in Minneapolis. The Democrat had just called for the abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign when she was sprayed.\n\nTrump says 'we're going to de-escalate a little bit'\n\nThe developments came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti's death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.\n\nThe president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.\n\nAs he left the White House on Tuesday, the president was asked whether Pretti’s killing was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.\n\nStephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff who had initially called Pretti “an assassin,” issued a statement suggesting CBP officers in Minneapolis “may not have been following” protocol. He said the Homeland Security Department’s initial statements about what transpired on Saturday was “based on reports from CBP on the ground.”\n\nEcuador files a protest with the US Embassy\n\nA video of the Ecuadorian consulate entry attempt posted on social media shows a staffer running to the door to turn the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” One ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.\n\nInternational law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.\n\n“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.\n\nA “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said. The State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘Maybe it wasn’t good here’\n\nImmigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.\n\nThe White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti’s killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.\n\nTrump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with the city's police chief, met with Homan on Tuesday and agreed to keep talking. Homan posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.”\n\nCourts weigh in on detained immigrants\n\nIn Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.\n\nAlso in Texas, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of ICE to appear in his courtroom, the man's attorney said.\n\nAttorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.\n\nIn an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.\n\nSchiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” he wrote.\n\nSchiltz's order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.\n\nSchiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nCatalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey and Karnowski from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis, Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.",

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s account posted the original image from Levy Armstrong's arrest before the official White House account posted an altered image that showed her crying.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Trump administration has not shied away from sharing AI-generated imagery online, embracing cartoonlike visuals and memes and promoting them on official White House channels.\n\nBut an edited — and realistic — image of civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong in tears after being arrested is raising new alarms about how the administration is blurring the lines between what is real and what is fake.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s account posted the original image from Levy Armstrong's arrest before the official White House account posted an altered image that showed her crying. The doctored picture is part of a deluge of AI-edited imagery that has been shared across the political spectrum since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by U.S. Border Patrol officers in Minneapolis\n\nHowever, the White House’s use of artificial intelligence has troubled misinformation experts who fear the spreading of AI-generated or edited images erodes public perception of the truth and sows distrust.\n\nIn response to criticism of the edited image of Levy Armstrong, White House officials doubled down on the post, with deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr writing on X that the “memes will continue.” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson also shared a post mocking the criticism.\n\nDavid Rand, a professor of information science at Cornell University, says calling the altered image a meme “certainly seems like an attempt to cast it as a joke or humorous post, like their prior cartoons. This presumably aims to shield them from criticism for posting manipulated media.” He said the purpose of sharing the altered arrest image seems “much more ambiguous” than the cartoonish images the administration has shared in the past.\n\nMemes have always carried layered messages that are funny or informative to people who understand them, but indecipherable to outsiders. AI-enhanced or edited imagery is just the latest tool the White House uses to engage the segment of Trump’s base that spends a lot of time online, said Zach Henry, a Republican communications consultant who founded Total Virality, an influencer marketing firm.\n\n“People who are terminally online will see it and instantly recognize it as a meme,” he said. “Your grandparents may see it and not understand the meme, but because it looks real, it leads them to ask their kids or grandkids about it.”\n\nAll the better if it prompts a fierce reaction, which helps it go viral, said Henry, who generally praised the work of the White House’s social media team.\n\nThe creation and dissemination of altered images, especially when they are shared by credible sources, “crystallizes an idea of what’s happening, instead of showing what is actually happening,” said Michael A. Spikes, a professor at Northwestern University and news media literacy researcher.\n\n“The government should be a place where you can trust the information, where you can say it’s accurate, because they have a responsibility to do so,\" he said. \"By sharing this kind of content, and creating this kind of content … it is eroding the trust — even though I’m always kind of skeptical of the term trust — but the trust we should have in our federal government to give us accurate, verified information. It’s a real loss, and it really worries me a lot.”\n\nSpikes said he already sees the “institutional crises” around distrust in news organizations and higher education, and feels this behavior from official channels inflames those issues.\n\nRamesh Srinivasan, a professor at UCLA and the host of the Utopias podcast, said many people are now questioning where they can turn to for “trustable information.” “AI systems are only going to exacerbate, amplify and accelerate these problems of an absence of trust, an absence of even understanding what might be considered reality or truth or evidence,” he said.\n\nSrinivasan said he feels the White House and other officials sharing AI-generated content not only invites everyday people to continue to post similar content but also grants permission to others who are in positions of credibility and power, like policymakers, to share unlabeled synthetic content. He added that given that social media platforms tend to “algorithmically privilege” extreme and conspiratorial content — which AI generation tools can create with ease — “we’ve got a big, big set of challenges on our hands.”\n\nAn influx of AI-generated videos related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement action, protests and interactions with citizens has already been proliferating on social media. After Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer while she was in her car, several AI-generated videos began circulating of women driving away from ICE officers who told them to stop. There are also many fabricated videos circulating of immigration raids and of people confronting ICE officers, often yelling at them or throwing food in their faces.\n\nJeremy Carrasco, a content creator who specializes in media literacy and debunking viral AI videos, said the bulk of these videos are likely coming from accounts that are “engagement farming,\" or looking to capitalize on clicks by generating content with popular keywords and search terms like ICE. But he also said the videos are getting views from people who oppose ICE and DHS and could be watching them as “fan fiction,” or engaging in “wishful thinking,” hoping that they're seeing real pushback against the organizations and their officers.\n\nStill, Carrasco also believes that most viewers can't tell if what they're watching is fake, and questions whether they would know \"what’s real or not when it actually matters, like when the stakes are a lot higher.\"\n\nEven when there are blatant signs of AI generation, like street signs with gibberish on them or other obvious errors, only in the “best-case scenario” would a viewer be savvy enough or be paying enough attention to register the use of AI.\n\nThis issue is, of course, not limited to news surrounding immigration enforcement and protests. Fabricated and misrepresented images following the capture of deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro exploded online earlier this month. Experts, including Carrasco, think the spread of AI-generated political content will only become more commonplace.\n\nCarrasco believes that the widespread implementation of a watermarking system that embeds information about the origin of a piece of media into its metadata layer could be a step toward a solution. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity has developed such a system, but Carrasco doesn’t think that will become extensively adopted for at least another year.\n\n“It’s going to be an issue forever now,” he said. I don’t think people understand how bad this is.”",

    "description": "Senate Democrats say they won't vote for a bill to fund DHS after the deadly ICE shooting, threatening to imperil a broader government funding effort.",
    "fullText": "Just days ago, it looked like the US would avoid a repeat of the government shutdown that took place in the fall.\n\nThen, federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nIn the span of just a few hours following the shooting on Saturday, the odds that the government will shut down later this week rose from roughly 10% to the high 70s on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.\n\nThat's because Democratic senators now say they won't vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS — the department that oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol — until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.\n\n\"What's happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Saturday. \"Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.\"\n\nThere are only two ways out of this:\n\nBut even if lawmakers go with the second option, a short shutdown through the weekend is likely.\n\nTo avoid a government shutdown after midnight late Friday evening, the Senate would need to pass the six-bill package, which funds DHS, the military, various government agencies, and a wide array of federal grants, among other things.\n\nThose six bills have already passed the House, and they've been stitched together into one larger package in the Senate.\n\nThe GOP may control the upper chamber, but they can't ignore Democrats. Due to the Senate's 60-vote \"filibuster\" rule, and the fact that Republicans hold just 53 seats, Democratic votes are necessary to advance most major bills, including this one.\n\nDemocrats are only opposed to the DHS bill, and Schumer has called on Republicans to work with Democrats to separate out the bills. But the GOP has balked so far at that idea.\n\nFurthermore, even if the bills are separated, the House would have to vote on them again to send them to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nThe House is out of session until next week, meaning a shutdown at least until then is highly likely.\n\nJust months ago, the federal government shut down for 43 days, the longest shutdown in American history. There are a few reasons why this one wouldn't be as bad.\n\nFor one, it would only be a partial shutdown, because lawmakers have already passed several bills to fund the government through September 30.\n\nSNAP and WIC payments would be unaffected, Capitol Hill staffers would still get paid, and national parks would likely remain open.\n\nAdditionally, the path out of a shutdown is more straightforward.\n\nIn the fall, Democrats were demanding changes to healthcare while holding all of government funding back. This time, Democrats are only objecting to the DHS funding.\n\nThat means it's plausible that the Senate would separate out the other five bills, the House would re-pass those bills next week, and the partial shutdown would only last a few days.\n\nStill, the DHS bill doesn't just fund ICE and border patrol. It also funds the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nThat raises the possibility of delays at airports and issues with disaster aid if the department goes unfunded for a long period of time.\n\nAdditionally, ICE will remain funded, even if the DHS bill doesn't pass for a long time.\n\nWhile the current DHS funding bill contains an additional $10 billion for ICE, the agency also received roughly $75 billion in funding via the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" in July.\n\nUnless lawmakers were to agree to rescind that funding — extremely unlikely given GOP control of Congress — that money's here to stay.",

    "description": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his caucus want the DHS funding bill stripped from the broader package, teeing up a partial government shutdown in the process.",
    "fullText": "Senate Republicans are moving ahead with a behemoth funding package in their bid to keep the government open and hope to blast through Democratic opposition in the process.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, on Monday teed up the first procedural step for the six-bill funding package, which includes the politically divisive Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spending bill, despite warnings from Senate Democrats that they would block the legislation.\n\nMonday’s action is just the first of several hurdles lawmakers will have to overcome, but important nonetheless given the extreme weather that rocked much of the country and threatened to delay the process altogether.\n\nSenate Democrats Threaten Shutdown By Blocking Dhs Funding After Minnesota Ice Shooting\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune’s, R-S.D., gamble comes as a Friday deadline to fund the government is bearing down on the Senate. Passing the package and sending it to President Donald Trump’s desk would fully fund the government until September, when lawmakers will again need to have passed a dozen spending bills to keep the lights on.\n\nBut the immediate fight and one that threatens to derail the GOP’s plan to avert yet another shutdown is over DHS funding.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his caucus have come out en masse against the broader package, including the Homeland funding bill, following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\nSchumer and Senate Democrats rapidly mobilized their opposition to the funding bill, despite maintaining a fragile truce with the GOP in their bipartisan government funding negotiations over the last two days.\n\nKey Senator Won't Fund Dhs As Ice, Federal Agents Enter His State\n\nDespite shoring up a largely unified front, including several moderate Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle to help Republicans reopen the government last year, Schumer does have one perennial defector.\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has consistently opposed any attempt to shut down the government. He notably joined Senate Republicans over a dozen times last year to reopen the government as his colleagues resisted.\n\nAnd like those times before, Fetterman is not keen on shutting the federal government down, despite agreeing with Senate Democrats that the DHS bill should be stripped from the broader package.\n\nHe noted in a statement that even shutting down the government would affect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding, given that the GOP’s colossal, \"one big, beautiful\" bill injected over $170 billion over the next several years into DHS.\n\nSenate Dems Revolt Against Dhs Funding Bill Amid Minneapolis Chaos, Hiking Government Shutdown Risk\n\n\"I reject the calls to defund or abolish ICE. I strongly disagree with many strategies and practices ICE deployed in Minneapolis, and believe that must change,\" Fetterman said. \"I want a conversation on the DHS appropriations bill and support stripping it from the minibus.\"\n\n\"It is unlikely that will happen, and our country will suffer another shutdown,\" he continued. \"We must find a way forward, and I remain committed to being a voice of reason and common sense.\"\n\nFetterman and his colleagues want the DHS bill stripped from the broader package and say that they would support those remaining five bills. But doing that would open up a procedural nightmare in the process and likely lead to a partial government shutdown, given that the House would have to return from a week-long break to weigh in.\n\nAnd like the last foray into a possible shutdown, Schumer argued that the onus was on Thune and Senate Republicans, despite Senate Democrats having negotiated the current funding package on a bipartisan basis.\n\n\"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\"\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "MAGA podcaster Tim Pool has called out President Donald Trump in the fallout of the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by Department of Homeland Security federal officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in less than three weeks.\n\nThe Culture War podcast host and longtime Trump suck-up has questioned the Trump administration’s narrative surrounding the killing of ICU nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, arguing that Trump is “weak” in the face of the ensuing chaos that is gripping the Twin Cities.\n\n“Empty hand, then gun in hand,” Pool wrote, commenting on slowed footage in the seconds surrounding Pretti’s shooting. “Appears the man may have been disarmed before being shot.”\n\n“This is a chain of events in a greater conflict. Neither side cares at this point what justifies it or doesn’t.\n\n“I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool concluded.\n\nPool, 39, heads his own independent media group, Timcast, and has some 2.5 million followers on X. His podcast covers right-wing talking points and conspiracy theories, and has hosted white supremacist Nick Fuentes and alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nDHS has said that the agents involved in the shooting acted in self-defence after the “armed suspect violently resisted.”\n\n“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” the department wrote in an official statement.\n\n“The suspect also had 2 magazines and no ID—this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\"\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference that she agrees with the White House’s statement that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.”\n\n“This individual... committed an act of domestic terrorism. That’s the facts,” Noem argued.\n\nSimilar statements have been made by Trump’s closest political allies—including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who branded Pretti an “assassin”—as the administration closes ranks to unify on its messaging.\n\nPool appears not to be buying any of it, although he has not entirely flipped sides. In a separate tweet, the commentator argued that those impeding the work of “federal agents dispatched by a duly elected government” are “fascists.”\n\n“Trump should personally go to Minneapolis and force the whole thing to shut down, no more fighting, no more partisan conflict,” Pool argued.\n\n“Trump isn’t Lincoln, he’s Buchanan.”\n\nPresident James Buchanan is frequently cited as the worst leader in U.S. history. The 15th president, serving from 1857 to 1861, failed to stop the country from tearing itself apart, leading to the Civil War.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz has also spurned the official White House narrative surrounding the events in his state’s capital, branding them “nonsense” and “lies.”\n\nPretti’s own parents have said that the Trump administration is spreading “sickening lies” about their deceased son that are “reprehensible and disgusting.”\n\nVideo analysis from news networks, including CNN and Bellingcat, has concluded that federal officers took the gun from the licensed firearm holder Pretti before shooting him at least 10 times while he was on the ground.\n\nProtests have engulfed Minnesota since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old mother of three, Renee Good, who was also killed by federal agents, not far from where today’s shooting took place.\n\nThe National Guard of Minnesota has been activated in Minneapolis as authorities work to ensure the ongoing protests remain peaceful.",

    "fullText": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) this weekend accused Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of applying a stark double standard in her comments made after the killing of Alex Pretti by a federal agent during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis, the second such death in the city this month.\n\nIn one part of an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, which has gone viral with almost 3 million views on one X post alone, Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized Noem’s suggestion that people should not attend protests with firearms, arguing the stance clashes with the Trump administration and conservatives’ fawning over previous armed protesters on the political right.\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem Slips Up With Awkward Typo In Heated Post About Immigrants In Minneapolis\n\nPretti was a legal gun owner who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon. Minnesota law allows permit holders to carry firearms in public, including at protests. The government’s claim that he was armed and provoking violence is at odds with videos and witness statements circulating publicly.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said: “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and the same administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse?”\n\n“When she [Noem] is talking about how merely showing up and inciting violence based on ideology against the government, when this administration has pardoned hundreds of Jan. 6th rioters who have then gone out into the streets and recommitted crimes of violence over and over again,” she continued.\n\nThe New York Democrat argued the message that is being sent is solely political: “What Secretary Noem is saying is not that you can’t do these things, is not that you can’t be armed, is not that you can’t attack your government. She just thinks that you can’t do that based on your political affiliation.”\n\nPolitics: 'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nThe lawmaker also warned: “The uncorking of chaos that this administration is trying to attempt against the American people is escalatory, it is dangerous and it is a complete abdication of leadership.”\n\n“We cannot go down this road,” Ocasio-Cortez added. “We cannot have countrymen against countrymen, citizen against citizen. This is not the America that we believe in. It is not the America that we stand in and we must unite together against this kind of very dangerous splintering that they are seeking to incite against people and divide us.”\n\nEconomist Sounds Alarm On Damage Trump Is Quietly Doing To The Economy\n\nKash Patel’s Viral Line About Protesters Sparks Anger Online\n\nMelania Trump Told To 'Read The Room' Over Documentary Stunt",

    "description": "Sen. Adam Schiff also argued the money funded to DHS has been “wasted hand over fist.\"",
    "fullText": "Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Ca.) declared Sunday he’s “not giving ICE or Border Patrol another dime given how these agencies are operating” as deadly sweeping Immigration and Custom Enforcement raids led by the Trump administration have sparked political and public backlash.\n\nAppearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Schiff made the statement after moderator Kristen Welker asked him if he’s “prepared to vote against Department of Homeland Security funding if it means partially shutting down the government, again, coming on the heels of an incredibly long shutdown.”\n\nPolitics: Democrats Consider Partial Government Shutdown To Curb ICE\n\nTelling Welker straight up that “Democrats are not going to fund that,” he continued, “The government will shut down if Republicans insist that that be joined with other government funding. It will be a Republican decision. They understand we’re not going to go along with this.”\n\nThe California senator noted Democrats are hoping “some of the Republicans in the Senate may see those scenes in the streets and be as repelled as we are, and vote against that continuation of violence also.”\n\nHe added: “If they don’t, it will be their decision whether they couple that funding for these ICE agents and Border Patrol agents with all these other government agencies.”\n\n“[Republicans] will make the decision. They’re in the majority if they want to shut down the government so they can perpetuate this violence,” Schiff said.\n\nPolitics: Sworn Witness Accounts Of Alex Pretti Killing Differ Sharply From DHS\n\nSchiff went on to vow he’s “not going to be a part of it.”\n\n“And I think anyone who votes to give them more money to do this will share in the responsibility and see more Americans die in our cities as a result.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker asked Schiff what the “exact impact” would be if legislators withhold funding now, considering “Republicans have already passed $170 billion in extra DHS funding through what they’ve dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Well, it would certainly, I hope, stop it from becoming even worse,” he responded. “They have thrown so much money at these agencies. They don’t know what to do with it. And there is no question that when we actually get a chance to do oversight again, which I hope will happen after this November, you are going to find all kinds of corruption [with] how that money is going out.”\n\nPolitics: House Passes Bill Funding ICE — With Help From Democrats\n\nSchiff then told Welker he believes they will find that the money has been “wasted hand over fist.”\n\n“There is going to be enormous waste, fraud and abuse in DHS given how money is being spent without any kind of real oversight,” he said.\n\nWatch Schiff’s interview on “Meet the Press” below.\n\nTrump Takes Aim At ‘Corrupt’ Adam Schiff As Next Target In His Political Retribution Tour\n\nAdam Schiff Calls Out Trump For 'Flip-Flopping' On Abortion\n\nRep.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is calling for the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, saying that she believes Noem is attempting to \"mislead the American public” about the fatal shooting of a 37 year-old protester in Minneapolis.\n\nThe call from Rosen, a moderate from Nevada who was part of the group that helped Republicans end the 43-day government shutdown last year, comes amid a growing fury from congressional Democrats who have also vowed to block funding for the Homeland Security Department. A House resolution to launch impeachment proceedings against Noem has the support of more than 100 Democrats, but few Senate Democrats have so far weighed in.\n\n“Kristi Noem has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year — and the abuses of power we’re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,” Rosen said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nRosen said Noem's conduct is “deeply shameful” and she \"must be impeached and removed from office immediately.”\n\nImpeachment proceedings are unlikely in the GOP-controlled Congress, but mounting Democratic outrage over the violence in the streets of Minneapolis is certain to disrupt Senate Republican leaders’ hopes this week to quickly approve a wide-ranging spending bill and avoid a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30.\n\nAnd while some moderate Democrats have been wary over the last year of criticizing the Trump administration on border and immigration issues, the fatal shootings in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7 have transformed the debate, even among moderates like Rosen.\n\nThe senator's call for impeachment followed Noem’s quick defense, without a full investigation, of the fatal shooting of Pretti by a Border Patrol agent. Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired “defensively” against Pretti as he “approached” them with a gun. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but he appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos.\n\nDuring the scuffle, agents discovered that he was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and opened fire with several shots, including into his back. Officials did not say if Pretti brandished the weapon.\n\nNoem said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation.”\n\n“This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” Noem said Sunday.\n\nIn her call for Noem's impeachment, Rosen cited other issues beyond the current ICE operations. She said Noem has also “violated the public trust by wasting millions in taxpayer dollars” on self promotion and cited reports that the Coast Guard purchased her two luxury jets worth $172 million.\n\nRosen’s statement follows that of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who is one of the more left-leaning members of the Senate Democratic caucus. Markey said last week that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against Noem, “who is right now actually orchestrating on the streets of our country this almost vigilantism on the part of ICE agents terrorizing cities all across the country.”\n\nAnd while other senators stopped short of calling for Noem's impeachment, several moderate Democrats who joined Rosen in voting to reopen the government last year said they would vote against Homeland Security funding this week even if it meant a government shutdown.\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that DHS is “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said that “we are not living in normal times.”\n\nAs administration officials immediately defended the shooting, several Republicans have called for a thorough investigation, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.\n\nHouse Democrats increasingly back Noem's impeachment\n\nCalls for Noem’s impeachment also grew louder in the House as the Democratic caucus had a phone call with Minnesota’s Gov. Tim Walz and the state’s Attorney General Keith Ellison, both former congressmen, according to a person familiar with the private call who requested anonymity to discuss it.\n\nMost of the House Democratic lawmakers who spoke during the meeting called for Noem's impeachment, said another person familiar with the call who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.\n\nNew York Rep. Laura Gillen, a Democrat who was one of only seven House Democrats who voted to fund the Homeland Security Department last week, said Sunday that “there must be accountability, which is why Secretary Noem must be impeached immediately.”\n\n“She is not focused on safety or border security; she’s focused on chaos and self-promotion, undermining local law enforcement and stoking violence as a result,” Gillen said in a post on X.\n\nAP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

    "description": "‘Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm,’ the former Georgia congresswoman wrote",
    "fullText": "Marjorie Taylor Greene has urged fellow MAGA supporters – and other Americans – to “take off their political blinders” over the death of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, warning that they are being “incited into civil war.”\n\n“I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement,” Greene wrote on X Sunday, the day after the fatal shooting. “However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment.\n\n“Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.”\n\nDespite video showing that 37-year-old Pretti was filming federal officers but did not have a weapon drawn, the Trump administration has claimed he had tried to assassinate agents in an act of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nThe incident was captured from multiple angles, including one that showed Pretti being sprayed with mace and wrestled to the ground while attempting to help a woman who had just been sprayed herself and had fallen to the ground. After being swarmed by around seven officers a shot rings out, followed by at least nine more, and Pretti falls still.\n\n“There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing,” Greene said.\n\nThe former Congresswoman asked MAGA to consider another scenario in which she replaced the protesters in Minnesota with those who supported the action on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\n“We lost our minds when we watched Biden’s FBI track down and aggressively carry out home invasions and arrest… peaceful J6’ers who walked in the Capitol through open doors,” she said.\n\n“Imaging [sic] if one of our MAGA independent journalists or even just a MAGA supporter stood in the street outside a J6’ers house while Biden’s FBI carried out a law enforcement operation, home invasion, and arrest.\n\n“Then Biden’s FBI goes to the MAGA guy videoing it all and shoves a woman with him to the ground and sprays them with bear spray then throws the MAGA guy to the ground as MAGA guy was trying to help the woman off the ground. Then Biden’s FBI beats MAGA guy on the ground, disarms MAGA guy, and then shoots him dead.\n\n“What would have been our reaction? Both sides need to take off their political blinders. You are all being incited into civil war, yet none of it solves any of the real problems that we all face, and tragically people are dying.”\n\nPretti’s death is the second fatal shooting to involve federal agents in Minneapolis in less than three weeks, following the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on January 7. Tensions and clashes between demonstrators have increased, as well as those between state and federal authorities.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said earlier Sunday that residents, as well as his own police department have “had enough.”\n\n“This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This has taken an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of trying to be the police department for a major city,” O’Hara told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\nO’Hara noted that he has received no official information from the federal government related to Saturday’s shooting. “Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a law enforcement-involved shooting,” he said.\n\nWhile the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was blocked from the scene of the shooting Saturday by federal officials, they were allowed access Sunday to canvas for witnesses.\n\nGreene’s comments represent the latest instance of her breaking from MAGA orthodoxy. Previously a firebrand Trump loyalist, she has publicly broken from the president in recent months over issues including the Epstein files and foreign policy. She stood down from Congress earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is keeping her de facto chief of staff for another year despite President Donald Trump refusing to make the arrangement official—or long term.\n\nCorey Lewandowski has emerged as the second most powerful person at the Department of Homeland Security after Noem herself, despite being classified as an unpaid special government employee who can only work 130 days per calendar year.\n\nHe was accused last year of vastly undercounting his work hours, prompting the White House to begin monitoring his work schedule.\n\nHe stayed in the role throughout 2025, and has now been rehired for 2026, Axios reported.\n\nThe 54-year-old secretary, dubbed “ICE Barbie” by the Daily Beast for her habit of cosplaying as an immigration agent, and Lewandowski, 52, are both married to other people but have long been rumored to be having an affair described by one Trump administration official as the “worst-kept secret” in Washington, D.C.\n\nBoth have denied being romantically involved, but the rumors have been so persistent that Trump refused to let Lewandowski serve as Noem’s official chief of staff.\n\nLewandowski has nevertheless rarely left Noem’s side since she became secretary, amassing a staggering amount of power at DHS in the process.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, he travels with Noem to meet with world leaders, participates in high-level policy meetings, advises the secretary on personnel decisions, arranges contractor meetings, reviews contracts, and schedules the secretary’s meetings with DHS officials and lobbyists.\n\n“Kristi is the face of DHS. Corey is the brains. He gets things done,” a senior administration official told Axios.\n\nLast week, an Axios reporter spotted Lewandowski standing at a gate at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where he was apparently discussing DHS vendor contracts loudly on the phone. The former Trump campaign chief specifically mentioned data company Palantir as well as a drone program, according to the outlet.\n\nA DHS spokesperson told Axios that Palantir has had a contract with the U.S. government for 14 years but that Lewandowski had never worked with Palantir and was not involved in the company’s government contract.\n\nLast year, however, The Wall Street Journal reported that Lewandowski had arranged for Noem to meet with Palantir and had told DHS officials to give the company additional work. Weeks later, DHS updated an existing contract to give Palantir an additional $29.9 million.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Lewandowski and DHS for comment.\n\nAs a special government employee, Lewandowski is allowed to maintain all of his private business interests and does not have to file a public financial disclosure form.\n\nHe is still subject to federal conflict of interest laws, but he refuses to say how he makes money, according to Axios.\n\nHe also remains close to the president, having managed Trump’s presidential campaign for part of the 2016 election cycle and later serving as an adviser to the Trump 2024 team.\n\n“No one can really control Corey,” a senior official told Axios.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Shortly after his arrest in early October, Little Village construction worker Juan Espinoza Martinez was led by three federal agents into a windowless interview room, still dressed in a green work T-shirt and carrying a small bottle of water.\n\n“You’re probably a little confused about what’s going on today, so I’m gonna try to explain it all to you,” Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Christopher Perugini told Espinoza Martinez at the outset of the Oct. 6 videotaped interview, which was played for a federal jury Wednesday. “Feel free to ask me any questions you want.”\n\nThen, the agents laid it on Espinoza Martinez, a 37-year-old father of three, why he was there.\n\n“Murder for hire?” Espinoza responded, holding up his hands questioningly.\n\n“Correct, so that’s what the charge you’re charged with,” Perugini said. “I’ll explain it to you as we’re going.”\n\nThe agents then confronted Espinoza Martinez with text messages he’d sent an acquaintance that included a photo of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who was then the face of Operation Midway Blitz, along with what agents characterized as cash bounties for Bovino’s kidnapping and murder.\n\nOver the course of the interview, the agents pressed Espinoza Martinez repeatedly on how he thought the messages looked. He said over and over he meant nothing by it, that they were nothing more than social media chatter, and that he had no intention of making any actual offer for Bovino’s killing.\n\n“I’m really confused about this,” Espinoza said at one point in the interview. “I have no gang affiliation…I’m not nowhere around there. I work for a living every day. I’m a union worker. I work concrete, so I don’t know.”\n\nPortions of the videotaped interview were played for jurors in court Wednesday as the trial of Espinoza Martinez got underway before U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who has lived in Chicago for years but is not a U.S. citizen, is charged in an indictment with a single count of solicitation of murder for hire, which carries up to 10 years in prison.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Espinoza Martinez told an acquaintance from the construction business, Adrian Jimenez, after an immigration agent shot a woman in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood on Oct. 4 “that he had dispatched members of the Latin Kings” to the area of 39th Street and Kedzie Avenue in response to the shooting.\n\nJimenez, who had worked as a government informant on and off for years, called up Homeland Security and shared the Snapchat messages that Espinoza Martinez had sent him saying, “2k on information when you get him” and “10k if u take him down,” along with Bovino’s photo, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn his opening statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Attorney Minje Shin said the case was not about someone charged with “expressing strong, even angry, views about immigration enforcement policy” or a hatred of Bovino.\n\n“Make no mistake – the evidence in this case will show that what the defendant did was not a joke, not just mouthing off, not just him blowing off steam behind a keyboard, not political discourse … what the defendant did was a solicitation of murder,” Shin said.\n\nShin said Espinoza Martinez was “fixated” on Bovino, who was “the face of the threat” to arrest, detain, and deport members of his community in Little Village, a threat that “hit close to home.”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s attorney, Jonathan Bedi, told the jurors in his opening remarks that the case was “riddled” with reasonable doubt because “the government cannot point to anything that shows Juan’s intent.”\n\n“When you cut through all of their words…all they have is their guesses and speculation,” Bedi said. “They are guessing.”\n\nBedi says there were no bags of money, no follow up, no recordings, no discussion of any plans. No location scouting, no escape route, no surveillance, no communication saying “Bovino’s here now would be a good time to act.”\n\n“Repeating neighborhood gossip is not a federal crime,” he said.\n\nBefore the Espinoza Martinez’s taped interview was played, jurors heard testimony from the informant, Jimenez, who walked slowly into court with a pronounced limp from a back issue he’s been suffering.\n\nDressed in a blue suit, with a salt-and-pepper beard, Jimenez said he’s been in construction for decades and recently started his own construction business. He also was convicted in 2000 of a felony and spent several years in prison.\n\nThough the jury did not hear details of that case, court records show Jimenez’s conviction was for an armed robbery and home invasion in Franklin Park that was charged in 2000. He was later sentenced to six years behind bars.\n\nJimenez told the jury he’s known Espinoza Martinez for “less than a year.” The defendant first reached out to him on Snapchat, looking for construction work, he said.\n\nJimenez testified he took photos of the Snapchat messages received from Espinoza Martinez on Oct. 2 and “almost immediately” contacted agents with HSI about them.\n\nJimenez testifies he had conversations about immigration with Espinoza Martinez “more than a few times.”\n\nBut when Shin attempted to ask what they talked about specifically, the defense repeatedly objected and the judge sustained it.\n\nOn cross-examination, defense attorney Dena Singer asked Jimenez a series of questions: You have a family, right? You work? You want to continue working and you want to continue staying in the U.S.? And you take care of your kids?\n\nJimenez answered “Yes” to all of them.\n\n“And you’re not somebody who commits murder-for-hire, right?” Singer asked,\n\nSinger also got Jimenez to acknowledge that Espinoza Martinez never asked him to take any action against Bovino or share the message with any wider audience.\n\nDid he ever say “Here’s where Bovino is going to be next?” Singer asked.\n\n“Did he ever say “Here’s a picture of cash,” or “I have someone who can pay you all this cash?'”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s trial is the first criminal case to stem from Operation Midway Blitz to go to trial.\n\nThough limited in scope, the case is expected to offer an important litmus test as immigration-enforcement operations continue to roil Chicago and other Democrat-led cities long targeted by President Donald Trump, including Minneapolis, where the killing of a U.S. citizen by an immigration agent earlier this month has sparked nationwide protests.\n\nThe case was held up by top Department of Homeland Security officials as an example of the violence and threats immigration agents were facing from gang members and even international drug cartels.\n\nIn the months since, however, evidence of Espinoza Martinez’s supposed gang affiliations has not materialized. Prosecutors vastly toned down that aspect of the case, first dropping mention of gang affiliation in the indictment handed up by a grand jury, then saying in a pretrial hearing they only intended to prove Espinoza Martinez had an “affinity” for the Latin Kings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the defense objected to prosecutors introducing a text string where Espinoza Martinez told an unidentified contact: “It’s going down bro my guys are ready in the vill (Little Village). Saints sd and 2Six being bitches. Kings on they ass n they scared.”\n\nProsecutors argued the conversation showed Espinoza Martinez was disappointed other gangs weren’t fighting back.\n\nBut Lefkow sided partially with the defense, saying the comments on Little Village can be shown to the jury, but not the references to the Latin Saints or Two-Six gangs.\n\nShe also excluded later text by Espinoza Martinez about “Chapo” having the Latin Kings’ back — a reference to former Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.",

    "description": "A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\n\nCobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge in Minnesota on Thursday ordered the release of a Liberian man four days after heavily armed immigration agents broke into his home using a battering ram and arrested him.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan said in his ruling that the agents violated Garrison Gibson’s Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.\n\n“To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G.’s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant,” he said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been ramping up immigration arrests in Minnesota in what the department has called its largest enforcement operation. DHS says its officers have arrested more than 2,500 people since Nov. 29.\n\nMarc Prokosch, Gibson’s attorney, said he was “thrilled” by the judge's order. He had filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal, and called the arrest a “blatant constitutional violation\" since the agents did not have a proper warrant.\n\nGibson’s wife was inside their Minneapolis home with the couple’s 9-year-old child during the raid. Prokosch said she was deeply shaken by the arrest.\n\nGibson, 37, was being held at an immigration detention center in Albert Lea after being held at a large camp on the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas, according to ICE’s detainee locator.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment on the order and has not responded to a prior email with follow-up questions about Gibson’s case.\n\nGibson, who fled the Liberian civil war as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed by the courts. He had remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.\n\nOnly days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices — the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks.\n\nBryan said in his Thursday order that he agrees with Gibson's assertions that since he had already been released on an order of supervision, officials “violated applicable regulations” by not giving him enough notice that it had been revoked and the reasoning, as well as not providing him an interview right after he was detained.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, had said that Gibson has “a lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.” She did not indicate if those were arrests, charges or convictions.\n\nCourt records indicate Gibson’s legal history shows only the one felony in 2008, along with a few traffic violations, minor drug arrests and an arrest for riding public transportation without paying the fare.\n\nThe Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — has been wracked by fear and anger in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, who was shot Jan. 7 during a confrontation with agents. On Wednesday, a man was shot and wounded by an immigration officer who had been attacked with a shovel and broom handle.",

    "fullText": "A U.S. citizen on her way to a medical appointment in Minneapolis was dragged out of her car and detained by immigration officers, according to a statement released by the woman on Thursday, after a video of her arrest drew millions of views on social media.\n\nAliya Rahman said she was brought to a detention center where she was denied medical care and lost consciousness. The Department of Homeland Security said she was an agitator who was obstructing ICE agents conducting arrests in the area.\n\nThat video is the latest in a deluge of online content that documents an intensifying immigration crackdown across the midwestern city, as thousands of federal agents execute arrests amid protests in what local officials have likened to a \"federal invasion.”\n\nRahman said that she was on her way to a routine appointment at the Traumatic Brain Injury Center when she encountered federal immigration agents at an intersection. Video appears to show federal immigration agents shouting commands over a cacophony of whistles, car horns and screams from protesters.\n\nIn the video, one masked agent smashes Rahman's passenger side window while others cut her seatbelt and drag her out of the car through the driver's side door. Numerous guards then carried her by her arms and legs towards an ICE vehicle.\n\n“I'm disabled trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I didn't move,” Rahman said, gesturing down the street as officers pulled her arms behind her back.\n\nRahman was caught in a “terrible and confusing position” and had “no where to go,” according to Alexa Van Brunt, Rahman's attorney and director of the MacArthur Justice Center.\n\n“Her only options were to move her car forward in the direction of ICE officers and risk being accused of trying to harm them—which led to Renee Good’s death—or stay stationary, which in the end led to physical violence and abuse,” Van Brunt wrote in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security disputed that account in an emailed statement on Thursday, saying that Rahman was an agitator who “ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene.” She was arrested along with six other people the department called agitators, one of whom was accused of jumping on an officer's back.\n\nThe department did not specify if Rahman was charged or respond to questions about her assertion that she was denied medical treatment.\n\nBarrage of viral videos draw scrutiny\n\nThe video of Rahman's arrest is one of many that have garnered millions of views in recent days — and been scrutinized amid conflicting accounts from federal officials and civilian eyewitnesses.\n\nOften, what's in dispute pertains to what happened just before or just after a given recording. But many contain common themes: Protesters blowing whistles, yelling or honking horns. Immigration officers breaking vehicle windows, using pepper spray on protesters and warning observers not to follow them through public spaces. Immigrants and citizens alike forcibly pulled from cars, stores or homes and detained for hours, days or longer.\n\nIn one video, heavily armed immigration agents used a battering ram to break through the front door of Garrison Gibson’s Minneapolis home, where his wife and 9-year-old child also were inside. The video shot inside the home captures a woman’s voice asking, “Where is the warrant?” and, “Can you put the guns down? There is kids in this house.”\n\nAnother video shows ICE agents, including Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, detain two employees at a Target store in Richfield, Minnesota. Both are U.S. citizens who were later released, according to social media posts from family members.\n\nMonica Bicking, 40, was leaving the homeless shelter where she works as a nurse when she took a video that appears to show a federal agent kneeing a man at least five times in the face while several other agents pin him facedown on the pavement in south Minneapolis.\n\nBicking works full time, so she says she doesn’t intentionally attend organized protests or confrontations with ICE. But she has started to carry a whistle in case she encounters ICE agents on her way to work or while running errands, which she says has become commonplace in recent weeks.\n\n“We’re hypervigilant every time we leave our houses, looking for ICE, trying to protect our neighbors, trying to support our neighbors, who are now just on lockdown,” Bicking said.\n\nRahman said in her statement that after her detainment, she felt lucky to be alive.\n\n“Masked agents dragged me from my car and bound me like an animal, even after I told them that I was disabled,\" Rahman said.\n\nWhile in custody, Rahman said she repeatedly asked for a doctor, but was instead taken to the detention center.\n\n“It was not until I lost consciousness in my cell that I was finally taken to a hospital,” Rahman said.\n\nRahman was treated for injuries consistent with assault, according to her counsel, and has been released from the hospital.\n\nShe thanked the emergency department staff for their care.\n\n“They gave me hope when I thought I was going to die.”",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Liberian man arrested over the weekend after heavily armed immigration agents used a battering ram to break through the front door of his Minneapolis home had been checking in regularly with federal authorities for years, his attorney said Tuesday.\n\nThe arrest of Garrison Gibson, 37 during a Minnesota immigration crackdown that the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest enforcement operation ever, was a “blatant constitutional violation,” since the agents did not have a proper warrant, said attorney Marc Prokosch.\n\nThe arrest Sunday came in a city increasingly on edge after an immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good last week, setting off waves of angry protests and clashes between authorities and activists.\n\n“This was an illegal search, absolutely,” said Prokosch, because agents had brought only an administrative warrant, which authorizes someone’s arrest but does not allow officers to forcibly enter private homes. Forced entry requires a criminal warrant signed by a judge.\n\nGibson, who fled the Liberian civil war as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed by the courts. But he had remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.\n\nOnly days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices — the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks.\n\n“He would have had another check-in in a couple of months,” Prokosch said. “So if he’s this dangerous person, then, why are they letting him walk around?\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said earlier this week that Gibson has “a lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.” She did not indicate if those were arrests, charges or convictions.\n\nMcLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether the agents’ use of force was justified.\n\nBut court records indicate Gibson’s legal history — dominated by a few traffic violations, minor drug arrests and an arrest for riding public transportation without paying the fare — shows only one felony, the 2008 conviction for third-degree narcotics sales that was later dismissed.\n\nProkosch said Gibson had been flown to Texas by immigration authorities in the hours after his arrest, then quickly flown back to Minnesota on a judge's order after the lawyer filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal. The courts have not yet ruled on the petition.\n\nGibson is currently being held at an immigration detention center in Albert Lea, Minnesota, after being held at a large camp on the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas. according to ICE’s detainee locator.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to an email from The Associated Press with follow-up questions about Gibson's case.\n\nGuns, activists and pepper spray\n\nGibson’s wife, Teyana Gibson Brown, a nurse who was inside the home with the couple's 9-year-old child during the raid, was deeply shaken by the arrest, Prokosch said.\n\nDuring their conversations, she “was having a hard time just completing sentences because she’s just been so distraught,” he said.\n\nActivists who had been keeping watch on the immigration agents before Gibson's arrest banged on drums, blew whistles and honked car horns in attempts to disrupt the operation and warn neighbors, some of whom poured into the streets.\n\nVideo taken at the scene by the AP shows agents pushing and pepper-spraying demonstrators.\n\nThe Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — has been convulsed by the killing of Good, who was shot Jan. 7 during a confrontation with agents.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents and that Good had “weaponized” her vehicle.\n\nCity and state officials have dismissed those explanations based on videos of the confrontation.\n\nState and local authorities are urging the public to share video and any other evidence as they seek to investigate Good’s death after federal authorities insisted they would work on their own and not share information.\n\nMore than 2,000 immigration arrests have been made in Minnesota since the enforcement operation began at the beginning of December, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News over the weekend that the administration would send additional federal agents to the state to protect immigration officers and continue enforcement.\n\nAP correspondent Elliot Spagat contributed to this report from San Diego.",

    "description": "A young protester narrowly avoided being killed but was left permanently blind after a Department of Homeland Security agent fired a nonlethal round at close range during a Santa Ana protest last week, according to family of the victim.",
    "fullText": "A young protester narrowly avoided being killed but was left permanently blind after a Department of Homeland Security agent fired a nonlethal round at close range during a Santa Ana protest last week, according to family of the victim.\n\nJeri Rees said her 21-year-old nephew underwent six hours of surgery and that doctors found shards of plastic, glass and metal embedded in his eyes and around his face, including a metal piece lodged 7 millimeters from a carotid artery.\n\n\"That could have cost him his life,\" Rees said.\n\n\"But now, for the next six weeks, he can't sneeze or cough because it could do a lot of damage.\"\n\nShe said doctors did not want to remove the shrapnel near the artery out of fear that it could kill him. She said her nephew, who is transitioning and goes by the pronoun he, also suffered a fractured skull around his eyes and nose and that doctors said he had permanently lost the vision in his left eye. She said the Homeland Security agent was a few feet from her nephew when he fired the weapon.\n\nSeveral videos of Friday's incident were shared on social media. One video shows demonstrators, who were protesting the fatal shooting in Minnesota of Renee Good, throwing orange safety cones at the agents, who were standing guard outside the Santa Ana federal building.\n\nThe video cuts to three agents approaching the group before one agent tries to take a young person into custody, prompting at least three demonstrators to try to intervene. The person taken into custody was identified by friends as Skye Jones.\n\nIn the video, at least one agent appears to fire nonlethal rounds at the crowd, hitting one woman in the leg before aiming and striking a protester in the face.\n\nThe video shows that person dropping to the ground after being shot, holding their face as the crowd retreats. The same agent then drags the protester by the hood of their jacket; they appear to be choking, grasping at the jacket binding their neck as blood pours from their left eye.\n\nAnother video shows the protester inside the building, lying on the ground bleeding while agents fire what appear to be pepper balls at the back of the head and neck of a man trying to record the incident with his cellphone.\n\nRees said her nephew told her that the agents pressed his face against the pool of blood and did not immediately call paramedics.\n\n\"The other officers were mocking him, saying, 'You're going to lose your eye,'\" she said, recalling what her nephew told her.\n\nFriday's violent clash occurred just two days after a federal immigration agent fatally shot Good, a Minnesota mother of three. The slaying sparked public outcry, nationwide protests and scrutiny of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who said the agent was acting in self-defense.\n\nFriday's incident is the latest in a number of confrontations around the country in which agents have used deadly or what experts say is excessive force.\n\n\"This constitutes as deadly force as far as the law is concerned,\" said Ed Obayashi of the video. The Modoc County sheriff's deputy and legal advisor to police agencies, who has testified in similar cases, said that \"all the training manuals and [legal] cases say you don't aim at the face because these projectiles can cause serious injury [or] death.\"\n\nObayashi said, based on law enforcement use-of-force standards, an officer can deploy deadly force if they feel their life is in imminent danger, or that they are in danger of great bodily harm.\n\n\"I just don't see that here,\" he said.\n\nIn downtown Santa Ana, hundreds had gathered that Friday night to protest the killing of Good and the Trump administration's mass deportations. Some were there to speak out against police brutality as well. Protesters marched around the downtown area, chanting \"ICE out of O.C.\" and holding signs that read \"No more raids, keep families together.\"\n\nAn earlier protest started at 3 p.m. and was organized by the social justice organization Dare to Struggle, said member Connor Atwood. Some members reconvened just before 6:30 p.m. for a demonstration outside the federal building put together by another organization, he said.\n\nAtwood, who was present during the incident, said the scene turned chaotic as the protest began to wind down and the crowd dwindled. A group of protesters are seen in a video standing near a staircase away from the building’s entrance.\n\nHomeland Security agents stepped out of the building various times throughout the night, firing nonlethal rounds toward protesters, Atwood said.\n\nProtesters had not attempted to get closer or breach the entrance of the building, Atwood said.\n\nA portion of the crowd eventually dispersed, but leaders of Dare to Struggle encouraged some protesters to stand their ground to “say we're not going to be intimidated away from expressing what we feel right now and delivering our message,” Atwood said.\n\nSome protesters then began burning an American flag. At some point after 8:30 p.m., Jones, a leader of Dare to Struggle’s Orange County chapter, was arrested, Atwood said. The other protester was then hit in the eye.\n\n“It wasn't just completely out of nowhere, but it was very sudden,” Atwood said, adding that agents “had come out of the building several times before that, but they had not tried to arrest anyone or grab anyone.”\n\nIn an email response to The Times, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, said a \"mob of 60 rioters threw rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement officers outside of the federal building.\"\n\n\"Two officers were injured. Two violent rioters were arrested and were charged with assault on federal officers and disorderly conduct,\" she wrote. \"This was a highly coordinated campaign of violence where rioters wielded shields.\"\n\nMcLaughlin did not respond to questions about protocols agents must follow when using less-lethal devices.\n\nA spokesperson for the Santa Ana Police Department said the only violence they were aware of that night were demonstrators tossing orange cones at the agents.\n\nAtwood said he didn’t witness bottles or rocks being thrown toward agents. Some firecrackers were set off near the sidewalk but away from the building entrance, he said.\n\nBoth Homeland Security agents and Santa Ana police were seen standing outside the federal building just after 10:30 p.m., according to video footage reviewed by The Times. Fire paramedics can be seen taking Rees' nephew in a gurney.\n\nAtwood said Jones had an initial hearing Monday. Rees said Jones had been released and was at the hospital with her nephew as of Monday night.\n\nAtwood said a news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday outside Santa Ana City Hall to provide more details about Friday's incident. The group is also raising money through GoFundMe to help with the protester's medical expenses.\n\nA.

    "description": "The Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have recently been deployed to the Minneapolis region.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is sending roughly 1,000 more immigration officers to Minnesota, expanding its law enforcement surge in the state and potentially escalating already tense relations between federal and local officials in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”\n\nLocal officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.\n\nOn Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”\n\nThe increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.\n\nThe Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.\n\nThe administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.\n\nThe Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",

    "fullText": "Pablo Manríquez on X/MeidasTouch\n\nRep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI) shredded “idiot” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday for immediately accusing Renee Nicole Good of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nGood was killed on Thursday in Minneapolis by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross, who shot Good in the face as she attempted to drive away from another agent who had his hand on her door handle after he told her to get out of her SUV. Good was pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting was caught on video and posted on social media.\n\nShortly after the killing, Noem quickly blamed Good for her own death and accused her of engaging in terrorism against Ross and the other agents. Noem claimed that Good had attempted to “ram them with her vehicle.”\n\nA photo taken of Good’s vehicle after the shooting shows a bloodied airbag and stuffed animals for her six-year-old, whom she dropped off at school just before she was killed, in the glove compartment.\n\nPablo Manríquez of Migrant Insider caught up with Magaziner outside the Capitol on Thursday and asked for the lawmaker’s reaction to Noem’s comments. The exchange was posted by Acyn Torabi of MeidasTouch.\n\n.@PabloReports: What do you make of Kristi Noem calling Renee Good a domestic terrorist?\n\nMagaziner: Kristi Noem is an idiot. pic.twitter.com/qhEh6tUNYT\n\n“What do you make of Kristi Noem calling Renee Good a domestic terrorist?” Manríquez asked.\n\nKristi Noem’s an idiot, right? Like, she went on TV before any of the facts were in. She made up this story on TV about ICE agents trying to dig their truck out of the snow or something, which was clearly false. Like she didn’t even realize that there was gonna be video of what happened when she went up and gave a false story.\n\nEverybody in the Trump administration lies, but she’s not even good at the lie, right? And we’ve seen that over and over again. So, you know, it would be ridiculous, it would be funny if it wasn’t so sad and tragic because actual people’s lives are being ruined and in some cases ended by the lawlessness of the administration. And, again, like, if they had just done what they said they would do and just focus on people with serious criminal records, no one would be complaining, but they can’t help themselves.\n\nAfter the shooting, President Donald Trump blamed Good for the shooting, calling her a “professional agitator.” Vice President JD Vance alleged she was a “deranged leftist.”\n\nThe post ‘Kristi Noem’s an Idiot’: Congressman Shreds DHS Secretary Who ‘Didn’t Even Realize That There Was Gonna Be Video’ of ICE Killing first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "\"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration believes you don't have the right to record Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in public. This stance is both factually wrong and an attempt to chill free speech by conflating it with violence.\n\nAt a July 2025 press conference in Tampa, Florida, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said, \"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations, encouraging other people to come and to throw things, rocks, bottles.\"\n\nIn September 2025, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin called \"videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online\" a form of doxing. She added, \"We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nThese aren't idle threats. The Trump administration strong-armed Apple into removing an app from its mobile store that tracked ICE activity and threatened criminal investigations into its creators.\n\nThe most aggressive application of this policy has come in Chicago under \"Operation Midway Blitz,\" where ICE officers have relentlessly targeted protesters, reporters, and clergy engaged in protected First Amendment activity.\n\nIn October, a group of journalists and protesters filed a lawsuit alleging \"a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians.\"\n\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs stated that federal officials' own testimony illustrated their point. For example, when ICE field director Russell Hott was asked if he agreed \"that it's unconstitutional to arrest people for being opposed to Midway Blitz,\" he answered \"No.\"\n\n\"Similarly, [U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Greg] Bovino testified that he has instructed his officers to arrest protesters who make hyperbolic comments in the heat of political demonstrations, even though such statements—which do not constitute true threats—are protected speech,\" the motion argued. (Hott and Bovino's depositions were filed under seal, and those comments were later redacted in a corrected filing by the lawsuit plaintiffs, but not before others took screenshots of them.)\n\nBased on voluminous evidence that feds in Chicago ignored her previous orders to curb their use of force, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction against DHS in early November 2025, saying the government's conduct \"shocked the conscience.\"\n\nEllis found much of the officials' testimony not credible. Bovino, for instance, testified that he never used force against a protester he was filmed tackling, and in another instance, Ellis said, he lied about being hit with a rock before firing tear gas at demonstrators. Nor did evidence support the government's claims that federal officers issued warnings before firing less-than-lethal projectiles at those protesters.\n\n\"Describing rapid response networks and neighborhood moms as professional agitators shows just how out of touch these agents are, and how extreme their views are,\" said Ellis.\n\nThe Trump administration responded by calling Ellis an \"activist judge,\" but it is squarely wrong when it comes to recording and protesting the police. Cato Institute senior fellow Walter Olson points out that, \"While the Supreme Court itself hasn't yet faced the issue squarely, the seven federal circuits that have done so…all agree that the First Amendment protects the right to record police performing their duties in public.\"\n\nLikewise, federal circuits have upheld the right to use vulgar language to oppose police without fear of retaliation, and to warn others of nearby police checkpoints or speed traps.\n\nAs Olson writes, the administration's \"attempt to alter reality by establishing new legal facts on the ground\" ultimately serves as a green light for informal repression. \"If the agents come to believe that they have blanket immunity [for] whatever they do, or that citizens have no right to record them, they are more likely to take aggressive informal action, such as grabbing phones or taking news reporters into custody on charges of obstruction (perhaps later quietly dropped).\"\n\nIt's not hard to find examples of this rotten agency culture in practice. In late October 2025, ICE officers broke out the window of a U.S. citizen's car and detained her for seven hours after she followed and photographed their unmarked vehicles. DHS accused her of reckless driving, attempting to block in officers with her car, and resisting arrest—all claims that she and her lawyer deny. Prosecutors did not charge the woman with a crime.\n\nRecording government agents is one of the few tools citizens have to hold state power accountable. Any attempt to redefine observation as \"violence\" is not only unconstitutional—it's authoritarian gaslighting. When a government fears cameras more than crimes, it isn't protecting the rule of law. It's protecting itself.\n\nThe post The Trump Administration Says It's Illegal To Record Videos of ICE. Here's What the Law Says. appeared first on Reason.com.",

    "fullText": "Fox News anchor John Roberts appeared skeptical of part of Kristi Noem’s statement about an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer killing a 37-year-old mom in Minneapolis on Wednesday.\n\nNoem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, asserted that the incident, which claimed the life of a U.S. citizen, who has since been identified as Renee Nicole Good, was related to an ICE vehicle getting stuck in the snow.\n\n“They got stuck in the snow because of the adverse weather that is in Minneapolis,” Noem, 54, insisted during a speech earlier Wednesday—a claim she reiterated during a press conference later that night.\n\n“They were attempting to push out their vehicle and a woman attacked them, and those surrounding them, and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle,” Noem said.\n\nAs for Noem’s claim about the snow, Roberts wasn’t buying it.\n\n“I’ve seen the video several times as well—kind of gone through it frame by frame. I don’t want to describe it because you can’t see the entire scene play out,“ Roberts, 69, said.\n\n“There is an area in front of the vehicle that is obscured by the vehicle itself, so we don’t know 100 percent what happened during that incident, but what I saw of it does counteract the narrative that they were trying to push their car out of the snow—the ICE agents who were involved here, because that vehicle was clearly in the middle of the street, as it was approached by a couple of federal agents before it sped off.”\n\nAs for the rest of the incident, like how the officer—who DHS claims feared for his life—fired multiple shots at Good through her driver’s side window as the mom-of-one was driving away, Roberts merely stated that there are differing opinions.\n\n“We will wait until we get clearance to look at this video and have eyes that are more expert than mine take a look at it,” he said. “Clearly, there are very, very conflicting opinions of what happened. We have the one opinion from DHS, and then we have the other opinion from the mayor and local officials.”\n\nDHS has argued that the agent fired in self-defense after Good, the mother of a now-orphaned 6-year-old son, attempted to kill him with her car, despite witnesses saying and video showing otherwise.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged the public not to buy into the “propaganda machine” from DHS, which was found to have provided a false account of an agent shooting a Chicago woman in her car in 2025, as The New Republic reported.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also pushed back on the DHS’s dubious version of events.\n\n“This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,” he said in a news conference, adding that ICE should “get the f--- out of Minneapolis.”\n\n“We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite,” he continued. “People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now somebody is dead. That’s on you, and it’s also on you to leave.”\n\nThis video is horrific. A full investigation is needed ASAP. Sure looks like ICE just killed that woman. https://t.co/nAUMjHvbkc\n\n— Jessica Tarlov (@JessicaTarlov) January 7, 2026\n\nLater on Wednesday, Fox News’ Jessica Tarlov had a stronger reaction than Roberts to the shooting, saying it looked “ICE just killed that woman.”\n\nThe Five co-host Harold Ford Jr. questioned Noem’s account as well.\n\n“I couldn’t understand when she said it was an act of ‘domestic terrorism’ and she said the car was stuck in snow, and the officers—I think her characterization, maybe she got bad information, because her characterization seemed inconsistent with what we are seeing here,” Ford said.\n\nWhen a colleague told Ford that Noem is working with Attorney General Pam Bondi to classify the act of ramming with a vehicle “domestic terrorism,” Ford said it didn’t seem to apply in this case.\n\n“Well, she might be, but those aren’t the facts,” he said. “She had the earliest comment about this. I’m just saying, her characterization of the facts doesn’t seem to be consistent with the video that we’re seeing. Maybe she’s seeing some other video.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to DHS for comment.",
