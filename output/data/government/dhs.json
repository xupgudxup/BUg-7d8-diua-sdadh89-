    "description": "A young protester narrowly avoided being killed but was left permanently blind after a Department of Homeland Security agent fired a nonlethal round at close range during a Santa Ana protest last week, according to family of the victim.",
    "fullText": "A young protester narrowly avoided being killed but was left permanently blind after a Department of Homeland Security agent fired a nonlethal round at close range during a Santa Ana protest last week, according to family of the victim.\n\nJeri Rees said her 21-year-old nephew underwent six hours of surgery and that doctors found shards of plastic, glass and metal embedded in his eyes and around his face, including a metal piece lodged 7 millimeters from a carotid artery.\n\n\"That could have cost him his life,\" Rees said.\n\n\"But now, for the next six weeks, he can't sneeze or cough because it could do a lot of damage.\"\n\nShe said doctors did not want to remove the shrapnel near the artery out of fear that it could kill him. She said her nephew, who is transitioning and goes by the pronoun he, also suffered a fractured skull around his eyes and nose and that doctors said he had permanently lost the vision in his left eye. She said the Homeland Security agent was a few feet from her nephew when he fired the weapon.\n\nSeveral videos of Friday's incident were shared on social media. One video shows demonstrators, who were protesting the fatal shooting in Minnesota of Renee Good, throwing orange safety cones at the agents, who were standing guard outside the Santa Ana federal building.\n\nThe video cuts to three agents approaching the group before one agent tries to take a young person into custody, prompting at least three demonstrators to try to intervene. The person taken into custody was identified by friends as Skye Jones.\n\nIn the video, at least one agent appears to fire nonlethal rounds at the crowd, hitting one woman in the leg before aiming and striking a protester in the face.\n\nThe video shows that person dropping to the ground after being shot, holding their face as the crowd retreats. The same agent then drags the protester by the hood of their jacket; they appear to be choking, grasping at the jacket binding their neck as blood pours from their left eye.\n\nAnother video shows the protester inside the building, lying on the ground bleeding while agents fire what appear to be pepper balls at the back of the head and neck of a man trying to record the incident with his cellphone.\n\nRees said her nephew told her that the agents pressed his face against the pool of blood and did not immediately call paramedics.\n\n\"The other officers were mocking him, saying, 'You're going to lose your eye,'\" she said, recalling what her nephew told her.\n\nFriday's violent clash occurred just two days after a federal immigration agent fatally shot Good, a Minnesota mother of three. The slaying sparked public outcry, nationwide protests and scrutiny of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who said the agent was acting in self-defense.\n\nFriday's incident is the latest in a number of confrontations around the country in which agents have used deadly or what experts say is excessive force.\n\n\"This constitutes as deadly force as far as the law is concerned,\" said Ed Obayashi of the video. The Modoc County sheriff's deputy and legal advisor to police agencies, who has testified in similar cases, said that \"all the training manuals and [legal] cases say you don't aim at the face because these projectiles can cause serious injury [or] death.\"\n\nObayashi said, based on law enforcement use-of-force standards, an officer can deploy deadly force if they feel their life is in imminent danger, or that they are in danger of great bodily harm.\n\n\"I just don't see that here,\" he said.\n\nIn downtown Santa Ana, hundreds had gathered that Friday night to protest the killing of Good and the Trump administration's mass deportations. Some were there to speak out against police brutality as well. Protesters marched around the downtown area, chanting \"ICE out of O.C.\" and holding signs that read \"No more raids, keep families together.\"\n\nAn earlier protest started at 3 p.m. and was organized by the social justice organization Dare to Struggle, said member Connor Atwood. Some members reconvened just before 6:30 p.m. for a demonstration outside the federal building put together by another organization, he said.\n\nAtwood, who was present during the incident, said the scene turned chaotic as the protest began to wind down and the crowd dwindled. A group of protesters are seen in a video standing near a staircase away from the building’s entrance.\n\nHomeland Security agents stepped out of the building various times throughout the night, firing nonlethal rounds toward protesters, Atwood said.\n\nProtesters had not attempted to get closer or breach the entrance of the building, Atwood said.\n\nA portion of the crowd eventually dispersed, but leaders of Dare to Struggle encouraged some protesters to stand their ground to “say we're not going to be intimidated away from expressing what we feel right now and delivering our message,” Atwood said.\n\nSome protesters then began burning an American flag. At some point after 8:30 p.m., Jones, a leader of Dare to Struggle’s Orange County chapter, was arrested, Atwood said. The other protester was then hit in the eye.\n\n“It wasn't just completely out of nowhere, but it was very sudden,” Atwood said, adding that agents “had come out of the building several times before that, but they had not tried to arrest anyone or grab anyone.”\n\nIn an email response to The Times, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, said a \"mob of 60 rioters threw rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement officers outside of the federal building.\"\n\n\"Two officers were injured. Two violent rioters were arrested and were charged with assault on federal officers and disorderly conduct,\" she wrote. \"This was a highly coordinated campaign of violence where rioters wielded shields.\"\n\nMcLaughlin did not respond to questions about protocols agents must follow when using less-lethal devices.\n\nA spokesperson for the Santa Ana Police Department said the only violence they were aware of that night were demonstrators tossing orange cones at the agents.\n\nAtwood said he didn’t witness bottles or rocks being thrown toward agents. Some firecrackers were set off near the sidewalk but away from the building entrance, he said.\n\nBoth Homeland Security agents and Santa Ana police were seen standing outside the federal building just after 10:30 p.m., according to video footage reviewed by The Times. Fire paramedics can be seen taking Rees' nephew in a gurney.\n\nAtwood said Jones had an initial hearing Monday. Rees said Jones had been released and was at the hospital with her nephew as of Monday night.\n\nAtwood said a news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday outside Santa Ana City Hall to provide more details about Friday's incident. The group is also raising money through GoFundMe to help with the protester's medical expenses.\n\nA.

    "description": "The Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have recently been deployed to the Minneapolis region.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is sending roughly 1,000 more immigration officers to Minnesota, expanding its law enforcement surge in the state and potentially escalating already tense relations between federal and local officials in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”\n\nLocal officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.\n\nOn Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”\n\nThe increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.\n\nThe Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.\n\nThe administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.\n\nThe Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",

    "fullText": "Pablo Manríquez on X/MeidasTouch\n\nRep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI) shredded “idiot” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday for immediately accusing Renee Nicole Good of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nGood was killed on Thursday in Minneapolis by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross, who shot Good in the face as she attempted to drive away from another agent who had his hand on her door handle after he told her to get out of her SUV. Good was pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting was caught on video and posted on social media.\n\nShortly after the killing, Noem quickly blamed Good for her own death and accused her of engaging in terrorism against Ross and the other agents. Noem claimed that Good had attempted to “ram them with her vehicle.”\n\nA photo taken of Good’s vehicle after the shooting shows a bloodied airbag and stuffed animals for her six-year-old, whom she dropped off at school just before she was killed, in the glove compartment.\n\nPablo Manríquez of Migrant Insider caught up with Magaziner outside the Capitol on Thursday and asked for the lawmaker’s reaction to Noem’s comments. The exchange was posted by Acyn Torabi of MeidasTouch.\n\n.@PabloReports: What do you make of Kristi Noem calling Renee Good a domestic terrorist?\n\nMagaziner: Kristi Noem is an idiot. pic.twitter.com/qhEh6tUNYT\n\n“What do you make of Kristi Noem calling Renee Good a domestic terrorist?” Manríquez asked.\n\nKristi Noem’s an idiot, right? Like, she went on TV before any of the facts were in. She made up this story on TV about ICE agents trying to dig their truck out of the snow or something, which was clearly false. Like she didn’t even realize that there was gonna be video of what happened when she went up and gave a false story.\n\nEverybody in the Trump administration lies, but she’s not even good at the lie, right? And we’ve seen that over and over again. So, you know, it would be ridiculous, it would be funny if it wasn’t so sad and tragic because actual people’s lives are being ruined and in some cases ended by the lawlessness of the administration. And, again, like, if they had just done what they said they would do and just focus on people with serious criminal records, no one would be complaining, but they can’t help themselves.\n\nAfter the shooting, President Donald Trump blamed Good for the shooting, calling her a “professional agitator.” Vice President JD Vance alleged she was a “deranged leftist.”\n\nThe post ‘Kristi Noem’s an Idiot’: Congressman Shreds DHS Secretary Who ‘Didn’t Even Realize That There Was Gonna Be Video’ of ICE Killing first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "\"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration believes you don't have the right to record Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in public. This stance is both factually wrong and an attempt to chill free speech by conflating it with violence.\n\nAt a July 2025 press conference in Tampa, Florida, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said, \"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations, encouraging other people to come and to throw things, rocks, bottles.\"\n\nIn September 2025, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin called \"videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online\" a form of doxing. She added, \"We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nThese aren't idle threats. The Trump administration strong-armed Apple into removing an app from its mobile store that tracked ICE activity and threatened criminal investigations into its creators.\n\nThe most aggressive application of this policy has come in Chicago under \"Operation Midway Blitz,\" where ICE officers have relentlessly targeted protesters, reporters, and clergy engaged in protected First Amendment activity.\n\nIn October, a group of journalists and protesters filed a lawsuit alleging \"a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians.\"\n\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs stated that federal officials' own testimony illustrated their point. For example, when ICE field director Russell Hott was asked if he agreed \"that it's unconstitutional to arrest people for being opposed to Midway Blitz,\" he answered \"No.\"\n\n\"Similarly, [U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Greg] Bovino testified that he has instructed his officers to arrest protesters who make hyperbolic comments in the heat of political demonstrations, even though such statements—which do not constitute true threats—are protected speech,\" the motion argued. (Hott and Bovino's depositions were filed under seal, and those comments were later redacted in a corrected filing by the lawsuit plaintiffs, but not before others took screenshots of them.)\n\nBased on voluminous evidence that feds in Chicago ignored her previous orders to curb their use of force, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction against DHS in early November 2025, saying the government's conduct \"shocked the conscience.\"\n\nEllis found much of the officials' testimony not credible. Bovino, for instance, testified that he never used force against a protester he was filmed tackling, and in another instance, Ellis said, he lied about being hit with a rock before firing tear gas at demonstrators. Nor did evidence support the government's claims that federal officers issued warnings before firing less-than-lethal projectiles at those protesters.\n\n\"Describing rapid response networks and neighborhood moms as professional agitators shows just how out of touch these agents are, and how extreme their views are,\" said Ellis.\n\nThe Trump administration responded by calling Ellis an \"activist judge,\" but it is squarely wrong when it comes to recording and protesting the police. Cato Institute senior fellow Walter Olson points out that, \"While the Supreme Court itself hasn't yet faced the issue squarely, the seven federal circuits that have done so…all agree that the First Amendment protects the right to record police performing their duties in public.\"\n\nLikewise, federal circuits have upheld the right to use vulgar language to oppose police without fear of retaliation, and to warn others of nearby police checkpoints or speed traps.\n\nAs Olson writes, the administration's \"attempt to alter reality by establishing new legal facts on the ground\" ultimately serves as a green light for informal repression. \"If the agents come to believe that they have blanket immunity [for] whatever they do, or that citizens have no right to record them, they are more likely to take aggressive informal action, such as grabbing phones or taking news reporters into custody on charges of obstruction (perhaps later quietly dropped).\"\n\nIt's not hard to find examples of this rotten agency culture in practice. In late October 2025, ICE officers broke out the window of a U.S. citizen's car and detained her for seven hours after she followed and photographed their unmarked vehicles. DHS accused her of reckless driving, attempting to block in officers with her car, and resisting arrest—all claims that she and her lawyer deny. Prosecutors did not charge the woman with a crime.\n\nRecording government agents is one of the few tools citizens have to hold state power accountable. Any attempt to redefine observation as \"violence\" is not only unconstitutional—it's authoritarian gaslighting. When a government fears cameras more than crimes, it isn't protecting the rule of law. It's protecting itself.\n\nThe post The Trump Administration Says It's Illegal To Record Videos of ICE. Here's What the Law Says. appeared first on Reason.com.",

    "fullText": "Fox News anchor John Roberts appeared skeptical of part of Kristi Noem’s statement about an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer killing a 37-year-old mom in Minneapolis on Wednesday.\n\nNoem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, asserted that the incident, which claimed the life of a U.S. citizen, who has since been identified as Renee Nicole Good, was related to an ICE vehicle getting stuck in the snow.\n\n“They got stuck in the snow because of the adverse weather that is in Minneapolis,” Noem, 54, insisted during a speech earlier Wednesday—a claim she reiterated during a press conference later that night.\n\n“They were attempting to push out their vehicle and a woman attacked them, and those surrounding them, and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle,” Noem said.\n\nAs for Noem’s claim about the snow, Roberts wasn’t buying it.\n\n“I’ve seen the video several times as well—kind of gone through it frame by frame. I don’t want to describe it because you can’t see the entire scene play out,“ Roberts, 69, said.\n\n“There is an area in front of the vehicle that is obscured by the vehicle itself, so we don’t know 100 percent what happened during that incident, but what I saw of it does counteract the narrative that they were trying to push their car out of the snow—the ICE agents who were involved here, because that vehicle was clearly in the middle of the street, as it was approached by a couple of federal agents before it sped off.”\n\nAs for the rest of the incident, like how the officer—who DHS claims feared for his life—fired multiple shots at Good through her driver’s side window as the mom-of-one was driving away, Roberts merely stated that there are differing opinions.\n\n“We will wait until we get clearance to look at this video and have eyes that are more expert than mine take a look at it,” he said. “Clearly, there are very, very conflicting opinions of what happened. We have the one opinion from DHS, and then we have the other opinion from the mayor and local officials.”\n\nDHS has argued that the agent fired in self-defense after Good, the mother of a now-orphaned 6-year-old son, attempted to kill him with her car, despite witnesses saying and video showing otherwise.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged the public not to buy into the “propaganda machine” from DHS, which was found to have provided a false account of an agent shooting a Chicago woman in her car in 2025, as The New Republic reported.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also pushed back on the DHS’s dubious version of events.\n\n“This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,” he said in a news conference, adding that ICE should “get the f--- out of Minneapolis.”\n\n“We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite,” he continued. “People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now somebody is dead. That’s on you, and it’s also on you to leave.”\n\nThis video is horrific. A full investigation is needed ASAP. Sure looks like ICE just killed that woman. https://t.co/nAUMjHvbkc\n\n— Jessica Tarlov (@JessicaTarlov) January 7, 2026\n\nLater on Wednesday, Fox News’ Jessica Tarlov had a stronger reaction than Roberts to the shooting, saying it looked “ICE just killed that woman.”\n\nThe Five co-host Harold Ford Jr. questioned Noem’s account as well.\n\n“I couldn’t understand when she said it was an act of ‘domestic terrorism’ and she said the car was stuck in snow, and the officers—I think her characterization, maybe she got bad information, because her characterization seemed inconsistent with what we are seeing here,” Ford said.\n\nWhen a colleague told Ford that Noem is working with Attorney General Pam Bondi to classify the act of ramming with a vehicle “domestic terrorism,” Ford said it didn’t seem to apply in this case.\n\n“Well, she might be, but those aren’t the facts,” he said. “She had the earliest comment about this. I’m just saying, her characterization of the facts doesn’t seem to be consistent with the video that we’re seeing. Maybe she’s seeing some other video.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to DHS for comment.",

    "description": "Chilling video of an ICE agent fatally shooting an American woman in Minneapolis has debunked much of the agency’s explanation of what occurred Wednesday morning. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claims that a woman in an SUV attempted to “ram” multiple agents. However, videos show that only the officer who opened fire was near the front of the vehicle, and he stepped to the side as he pulled the trigger. Noem, 54, further claimed that the unnamed woman “attacked” agents—plural—as they tried to push a stuck vehicle out of the snow. There is no video evidence of this.",
