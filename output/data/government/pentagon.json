    "fullText": "The Defense Department is rethinking what it means to serve your country, and it no longer necessarily involves a uniform.\n\nThrough a new initiative called the US Tech Force, the federal government is recruiting college students and Silicon Valley's brightest to spend two years modernizing government systems, working as engineers, data scientists, and technical leaders.\n\n\"We're hoping to get thousands of people out of college for a two-year stint — sort of make it, this is your service to the country as a technologist rather than as a soldier,\" Emil Michael, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering and the agency's chief technology officer, said last week on the No Priors podcast, a tech show hosted by venture capitalists Sarah Guo and Elad Gil. Michael previously worked as Uber's chief business officer.\n\n\"We're going to try to make that a badge of honor,\" he added.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, which is headed by former VC Scott Kupor, is coordinating the early-career program in partnership with other agencies, including the Department of Defense. Salaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said in December.\n\nThe program, announced in December, joins a long history of initiatives by Silicon Valley technologists to pluck students out of classrooms and into boardrooms. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency famously brought a youthful energy and move-fast-and-break-things ethos to Capitol Hill. Palantir's Meritocracy Fellowship implored high schoolers to \"skip the indoctrination\" of college and \"get the Palantir Degree.\"\n\nMichael told Guo he is personally doing some of the candidate hunting, spending what he calls \"recruiting Tuesdays,\" dialing his investor buddies for people \"on the bench\" and technologists in his network who recently left a job: \"I'm like, 'Hey, do you have a year to spare doing the coolest stuff you could possibly imagine?'\"",

    "description": "Stars and Stripes journalists worry the Pentagon's anti-\"woke\" overhaul will shatter their ability to provide the timely information troops need.",
    "fullText": "Staffers at Stars and Stripes — a military-focused publication funded in part by the Pentagon but with a remit from Congress to operate independently — are worried about an \"America First\" takeover.\n\nAfter a Pentagon spokesman posted that the paper needed to move away from what he characterized as \"woke distractions\" and \"repurposed DC gossip columns,\" the editor in chief sent a message to the anxious staff.\n\nIn the memo, obtained by Business Insider, Erik Slavin responded to the \"surprise\" announcement from the Pentagon. \"The people who risk their lives in defense of the Constitution have earned the right to the press freedoms of the First Amendment,\" he wrote. \"We will not compromise on serving them with accurate and balanced coverage, holding military officials to account when called for.\"\n\nThere's growing unease among the staff about the Pentagon's plans for the paper and its original reporting, several told Business Insider. The military has multiple avenues for press releases and other official government communications; Stars and Stripes isn't one of them.\n\nStars and Stripes is a news outlet with origins dating to the Civil War that serves active-duty troops, military families, and veterans. Half of its funding comes from the Pentagon budget. The paper is free for troops deployed to war zones, and sold for $1 at bases across Europe and the Pacific. It distributed 6.2 million papers in fiscal year 2024. The rest of its revenue comes from advertisements and online subscriptions.\n\nSome headlines from a recent issue included:\n\nStars and Stripes, which has roughly four dozen editorial staff, according to its online directory, has long operated with editorial independence, though not without pressure. It came under threat of being shut down during the first Trump administration, and now Pentagon leaders are signaling a desire to exert new control.\n\nPentagon press secretary Sean Parnell said in a statement on X that the plan is to \"refocus its content away from woke distractions;\" he did not cite specific articles by Stripes staff. These moves have rattled the editorial staff, who say the mood inside the newsroom is uncertain and that Parnell has not spoken to their newsroom or answered questions about the changes. Reporters fear that their jobs are in jeopardy.\n\nEvidence of an impending overhaul can be seen in applications with questions including how journalists would \"help advance the President's Executive Orders\" and how they would improve government efficiency.\n\nSuch job application questions emerged across the government during a blitz of DOGE-driven federal reforms early last year aimed at cutting spending and enforcing ideological alignment across federal agencies.\n\nStars and Stripes has prided itself on editorial independence from Defense Department officials, and describes its mission as \"news honestly, fairly, and objectively without personal opinion or bias.\"\n\n\"Stars & Stripes will be custom tailored to our warfighters,\" Parnell said in a X post. \"It will focus on warfighting, weapons systems, fitness, lethality, survivability, and ALL THINGS MILITARY. No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints.\"\n\nA current staffer expressed confusion at what of Stars and Stripes' content could be considered \"woke;\" Parnell didn't provide examples.\"It's just hard for me to wrap my head around,\" a current Stars and Stripes staffer shared.\n\nThe Defense Department declined to comment on questions about how the Pentagon intends to overhaul the outlet or cut its staff and referred Business Insider to Parnell's post without answering questions.\n\nWhile Stars and Stripes does cover Pentagon leadership and some Beltway politics related to US military issues, the bulk of its reporting focuses on military-specific issues that impact troops and families daily — base healthcare, military school systems, crime on base, and the lived experiences of service members stationed overseas.\n\nStars and Stripes reporters received recent accolades for reporting on the 2020 murder of Army Spc. Vannesaa Guillen, photojournalism focused on veterans, and coverage of the impacts of sexual assault and suicide on military families. The outlet received one of journalism's most prestigious awards in 2010, a George Polk Award, for coverage highlighting the Pentagon's efforts to profile journalists with external help and shift them toward more favorable coverage of the war in Afghanistan.\n\nOmbudsman Jacqueline Smith, who helps preserve the outlet's independence, told Business Insider that Parnell's statement came as \"a complete surprise.\"\n\n\"If the Department of Defense or War begins to dictate what the coverage should be, what the 'news' should be in Stars and Stripes,\" she said, then \"it loses its credibility and harms its mission to provide fair and impartial news to the military community.\"\n\nDemocratic senators wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to voice their support for Stars and Stripes' continued editorial independence.\n\n\"Congress has been clear for decades that Stars and Stripes must be governed by First Amendment principles and insulated from political influence,\" the letter said.\n\nConcerns about Stars and Stripes' independence come amid a broader crisis in military journalism, as major outlets crumble. Military Times has been hit by multiple rounds of layoffs, dramatically reducing its reporting capacity, while another online news site, Military.com, was sold to a private equity firm and its veteran-heavy staff was gutted, effectively ending its accountability-focused reporting, former Stripes staffers said.\n\nThose outlets, and Stars and Stripes, have historically covered important issues such as food scarcity on base, traumatic brain injuries, job pressures, and suicide within the ranks.\n\nStaffers at Stars and Stripes are also worried about their jobs. On Thursday, The Daily Wire reported the Pentagon plans to staff Stars and Stripes with more active-duty personnel, a change that could mean layoffs for civilian reporters and fewer stories that spotlight problems, Stripes staffers said.\n\nMembers of the editorial staff told Business Insider that they want to stay at the paper, but some have already started looking for new work.\n\n\"In my gut,\" a staffer said, \"I have a very uneasy feeling about where this is headed.\"",

    "description": "Hegseth's effort to punish a US senator \"places other retirees who have spoken up potentially in jeopardy,\" a military law expert said.",
    "fullText": "A new lawsuit from a Democratic senator and combat veteran at the heart of a free speech fight seeks to block the Pentagon's intensifying crackdown.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday, warning that the Pentagon's effort to punish him \"sends a chilling message\" to veterans who speak out against the Trump administration. \n\nHegseth accused Kelly of \"seditious\" acts after Kelly publicly reminded US service members that they are not required to follow illegal orders. The Pentagon's actions against Kelly have troubling implications for the political speech of millions of veterans, military law experts said.\n\nHegseth's effort to muzzle a US senator \"places other retirees who have spoken up potentially in jeopardy,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School who is a retired Air Force JAG. \"Not knowing whether or not he's going to come after you already has a chilling effect.\"\n\nKelly said his lawsuit is about fighting back. The Democratic lawmaker announced the federal lawsuit on Monday. His suit also named the Department of Defense, Navy Secretary John Phelan, and the Navy Department as defendants. Kelly's video urging troops not to follow illegal orders.\n\nVeterans who serve 20 years or more are eligible for a military pension, but those benefits can be revoked or reduced if retirees are found to have violated military law while in uniform. By contrast, Hegseth's move seeks to punish a veteran for his speech long after serving in uniform, an approach one expert on military law called baseless.\n\nKelly's lawsuit argues that using the military justice system to punish veterans' political speech risks setting a precedent that abuses the First Amendment rights of other retired troops.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that nothing in the law allows the Pentagon to revisit a retirement determination based on a veteran's speech. Such a move, the filing says, would raise \"serious constitutional concerns\" and leave retired service members facing a constant threat to their earned benefits.\n\nThere's no legal basis for Hegseth's pursuit, VanLandingham said. The defense secretary initially sought to court-martial Kelly, threatening him with the military equivalent of a criminal trial. It later opted for a lesser administrative punishment.\n\n\"The process is the punishment,\" said Frank Rosenblatt, a retired Army JAG and professor at Mississippi College School of Law. \"The claim against Kelly had no merit.\"\n\n\"Senator Kelly's speech is not punishable under the UCMJ,\" the National Institute of Military Justice nonprofit group said in a December statement in reference to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to halt actions that could reduce Kelly's military rank and retirement pay and characterizes that effort as \"unlawful.\"\n\nAfter filing the lawsuit, Kelly requested a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction from the federal court, seeking to halt the Pentagon's actions while the case is reviewed on its merits. Both are emergency measures that ask a judge to stop government action before permanent harm occurs.\n\nThe federal government has been increasingly pushing cases important to the Trump administration onto a \"rocket docket,\" Rosenblatt said, accelerating litigation toward higher courts. If the judge assigned to the case, US District Judge Richard Leon, issues a ruling the government doesn't like, \"this could move very quickly to the DC Circuit and potentially the Supreme Court.\"\n\nLeon has previously ruled against the military's authority over retirees.\n\n\"I am not concluding today that Congress could never authorize the court-martial of some military retirees,\" Leon wrote in a 2019 memorandum opinion that rejected the government's argument that military jurisdiction over all retirees was necessary to maintain good order and discipline of its active force. The judge noted he had not seen a clear argument for \"why the exercise of such jurisdiction over all military retirees is necessary.\"\n\nIn a post on X last week, Hegseth called Kelly's video with five other Democratic lawmakers \"reckless and seditious\" and said it was \"clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline.\"\n\nThe military justice provisions that Hegseth accused Kelly of violating — Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice — are not explicitly tied to sedition and can cover a wide range of alleged misconduct.\n\nKelly's lawsuit argues that allowing the executive branch to punish a member of Congress for speech is a threat to the Constitution and erodes congressional oversight of the armed services.\n\n\"We are aware of the litigation,\" a Pentagon spokesperson said Tuesday when asked for comment on the lawsuit. \"However, as a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.\" That same day, Hegseth took aim at Kelly's military rank in an X post: \"'Captain' Kelly knows exactly what he did, and that he will be held to account.\"",

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "fullText": "The Defense Department has spent more than a year testing a device purchased in an undercover operation that some investigators think could be the cause of a series of mysterious ailments impacting US spies, diplomats and troops that are colloquially known as Havana Syndrome, according to four sources briefed on the matter.\n\nA division of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, purchased the device for millions of dollars in the waning days of the Biden administration, using funding provided by the Defense Department, according to two of the sources. Officials paid “eight figures” for the device, these people said, declining to offer a more specific number.\n\nThe device is still being studied and there is ongoing debate — and in some quarters of government, skepticism — over its link to the roughly dozens of anomalous health incidents that remain officially unexplained.\n\nCNN has asked the Pentagon, HSI and the DHS for comment. The CIA declined to comment.\n\nThe device acquired by HSI produces pulsed radio waves, one of the sources said, which some officials and academics have speculated for years could be the cause of the incidents. Although the device is not entirely Russian in origin, it contains Russian components, this person added.\n\nOfficials have long struggled to understand how a device powerful enough to cause the kind of damage some victims have reported could be made portable; that remains a core question, according to one of the sources briefed on the device. The device could fit in a backpack, this person said.\n\nThe acquisition of the device has reignited a painful and contentious debate within the US government about Havana Syndrome, known officially as “anomalous health episodes.”\n\nThe mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of US diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including vertigo and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world.\n\nIn the subsequent decade the intelligence community and the Defense Department have sought to understand if those officials were the victims of some kind of directed energy attack by a foreign government — with senior intelligence officials saying publicly that there wasn’t enough evidence to support that conclusion and victims arguing that the US government has gaslit them and ignored important evidence that Russia was attacking American government officials.\n\nStill, defense officials considered their findings serious enough that they briefed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees late last year, including reference to the acquired device and its testing.\n\nOne key concern now for some officials is that if the technology proves viable it may have proliferated, several of the sources said, meaning that more than one country could now have access to a device that may be capable of causing career-ending injuries to US officials.\n\nCNN was not able to learn where — or from whom — HSI purchased the device, but HSI has a history of collaboration with the Defense Department for operations that take place all over the globe. The office has broad jurisdiction to investigate crimes linked to customs violations, including investigations into the proliferation of US-controlled technology or expertise overseas.\n\nThose investigations are “the single biggest collaboration point between HSI and the US military,” according to a former Homeland Security official.\n\nFor example, when the US military came across US technology in Afghanistan or Iraq that raised questions about how those components came to the region, it would turn to HSI, according to the official.\n\nIt was also not clear how the US government learned of the existence of the device in order to purchase it. Havana Syndrome — and its cause — have remained frustratingly opaque to both the intelligence community and the medical community.\n\nOne problem facing the medical community is that there is still not a clear definition of “anomalous health incidents” or AHIs. Tests were done, in some cases, long after symptoms began, making it harder to understand what physically happened.\n\nIn 2022, an intelligence panel investigating the cause of AHIs said that some of the episodes could “plausibly” have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source.\n\nBut in 2023, the intelligence community said publicly that it could not link any cases to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US. As recently as January of 2025, the broader intelligence community assessment remained that it was very unlikely that the symptoms were caused by a foreign actor — even as an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence emphasized that analysts cannot “rule out” the possibility in some small number of cases.\n\nThat stance has long incensed victims, many of whom believe strongly that intelligence exists offering black-and-white evidence that Russia is behind their symptoms, some of which have been severe enough to force retirement.\n\nSome current and former CIA officers have raised concerns that the agency soft-pedaled its investigation, CNN has previously reported.\n\nThe acquisition of the device has been treated by some victims as potential vindication.\n\n“If the [US government] has indeed uncovered such devices, then the CIA owes all the victims a f**king major and public apology for how we have been treated as pariahs,” Marc Polymeropoulos, one of the first CIA officers to go public with injuries he says he sustained in an attack in Moscow in 2017, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nCNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this story.",

    "description": "Pentagon reporting on military suicide rates is usually released each fall. Right now, it remains unpublished, with no explanation.",
    "fullText": "A critical data source for US military suicide prevention efforts is late.\n\nThe annual suicide report, which the Department of Defense typically publishes each fall, provides suicide statistics from the previous calendar year that inform Congress, researchers, and senior leaders across the services on efforts to combat military suicide, a persistent problem.\n\nThe defense department is also delayed in releasing its quarterly suicide data for 2025, with the third-quarter figures still unpublished, months later than usual.\n\nBusiness Insider queried the Pentagon in mid-December about the anticipated release date of the annual report.\n\n\"The Department has nothing to announce at this time,\" a department spokesperson replied in an email. \"We will follow up if anything changes.\" When asked again this week why the report is delayed and when it might be published, the Pentagon did not respond.\n\nBusiness Insider sent a separate email query to the Defense Suicide Prevention Office, which releases the report. The office did not respond.\n\nIt is unclear whether the delay is tied to the government shutdown.\n\nThough the data is beneficial, the monthslong delay is unlikely to significantly affect research or prevention efforts, said Ron Kessler, a principal investigator on a long-term Army suicide study and a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School. He said researchers depend more frequently on detailed data that reveals patterns and circumstances around deaths.\n\nThe bigger issue is tied to accountability, public transparency, and oversight, he said.\n\n\"Publishing is letting the outside world know what's going on,\" Keller said. \"And that's useful for holding organizations accountable.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs have each tried to improve suicide prevention efforts, Kessler said, highlighting a project he's involved in that's testing whether artificial intelligence can effectively identify people at risk of suicide. The annual reports reveal the level of progress and show where further work is needed.\n\n\"It's important for the data to be out there,\" Kessler added, \"not to ever be to a point where we say what's not being shown anymore. It's good for the public to be able to say, 'Is the military doing a good job? What's going on?'\"\n\nSuicide deaths among service members rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the most recent publicly available data — from calendar year 2023 — showed a small increase over the year prior. According to the Defense Suicide Prevention Office, military suicide deaths have increased gradually since 2011.\n\nThe 2023 report showed that young enlisted men accounted for the largest share of suicide deaths in the US military. That mirrors broader national trends. American men are nearly four times more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\nFirearms were involved in roughly half of all US suicide deaths in 2023, and previous military reports have repeatedly identified access to firearms as a risk factor, particularly for younger enlisted personnel.\n\nSome military leaders recently emphasized suicide prevention needs during the holiday season. In November, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll directed supervisors across the Army to conduct daily check-ins with their subordinates through mid-January.\n\nThough the initiative was initially lauded, some supervisors and troops online have described the mandatory directive as unintentionally burdensome.\n\nThe broader Pentagon reporting delays coincide with certain organizational changes inside the Army. A September Army memo highlighted plans to disband its directorate responsible for overseeing soldier quality-of-life issues, known as a G-9, citing \"administrative convenience.\" The responsibilities of that office have since been folded into the service's human resources directorate.\n\nArmy spokeswoman Heather J. Hagan confirmed the change to Business Insider on Thursday, adding that the service remains committed to troop and family quality of life.\n\nIt is unclear how the change may affect oversight of soldier well-being or how suicide prevention priorities are being evaluated, as the Pentagon's annual suicide data remains unpublished.",

    "description": "The military faces a new recruiting crisis as America's teen population shrinks and outreach methods fail. The Pentagon is rethinking its playbook.",
    "fullText": "Military recruiting is on the upswing, but many recruiters say it's never been harder to get young people interested in service.\n\nPhone lists of numbers that once rang a family landline now dead-end at parents' cellphones. School access can vary from one street to the next. And while a direct message might be the fastest way to reach an overly online 17-year-old, finding the right social media handle can feel like chasing ghosts. The hunt has become so grueling that the time it takes to meet quotas of up to two recruits a month is pushing some recruiters into burnout territory.\n\nThese are some of the frustrations Business Insider heard while speaking to nearly four dozen Marine recruiters, leaders, and other officials for a four-part series on recruiter welfare.\n\nThe hunt for solutions is on, and legislation and use of artificial intelligence could be on the horizon.\n\nThe Pentagon is facing steep declines in young Americans' propensity and fitness to serve and public confidence in the military, long one of the government's most-trusted institutions, according to public polling.\n\nBoosting young Americans' interest in service, and reaching them in the first place, will require more than traditional military recruiting efforts, those involved agree. Political momentum for broader measures is already building.\n\nProject 2025, the conservative policy blueprint, outlines a major expansion of recruiting in schools: increased access for recruiters, more Junior ROTC programs, and a requirement that federally funded schools administer the military entrance exam. An effort to provide recruiters with improved access to high schools was included in the national defense spending bill signed into law in December.\n\nThe office of the defense secretary, which did not respond to a request for comment, recently established a new Recruitment Task Force. The Corps' Recruiting Command, which is part of the task force, is seeking legislative changes to help \"improve the student data collected in support of recruiting,\" a Marine spokesman told Business Insider.\n\nExperts are pressing for urgent solutions as population shifts reduce pools of young people eligible for the military.\n\n\"The coming declining birth rate challenge is so pronounced, even if the services were doing everything right to get to our current requirements, the math is just going to change,\" said Kate Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security and author of a recent report on recruiting.\n\nOver the next 16 years, the total number of children turning 18 is expected to fall by 700,000, representing a 13% drop, according to Kuzminski's research.\n\n\"Recruiters' jobs are going to be made a lot more difficult by this generational decline,\" Kuzminski said. Soon, they'll be forced to contend with capturing a larger percentage of American youth than ever before to meet the same end-strength requirements.\n\nAs recruiting pools narrow, the Army and Navy have found a way to turn otherwise unqualified young people into fit recruits, with new pre-boot camp preparatory courses to help applicants raise test scores or lose weight to meet military fitness standards.\n\nThe approach has helped dramatically boost enlistments. But the effort has drawn scrutiny over whether those services are accepting too many low-scoring applicants.\n\n\"The things that have worked up until now are not going to work in the future,\" Kuzminski said of recruiting.\n\nFor now, Marines still find new recruits by canvassing malls, attending community events, visiting schools, messaging social media accounts, and making dozens of phone calls that often reach a parent who isn't thrilled about the idea of their child joining the military.\n\nHigh schools that receive federal funding are legally required to allow recruiters access to grounds for pitches to classrooms or career fairs. But several recruiters said access isn't uniformly offered, and can hinge on the relationships recruiters foster with educators.\n\nA Marine recruiting official said geography can play a role and that some areas in the Northeast are known for more regularly keeping out recruiters.\n\nMore than half a dozen recruiters said conservative or rural areas aren't necessarily more welcoming, either. In their view, new enlistees are rarely motivated by politics; they're drawn by purpose, belonging, and the promise of financial stability.\n\nEven in places where \"support the troops\" is a common refrain, recruiters said, many parents resist the idea of their children joining the military.\n\nAnother factor: With fewer Americans personally connected to the armed forces, interest in enlisting has waned. A dwindling veteran population means fewer role models to inspire the next generation, and after two decades of the Global War on Terror, some veterans discourage their own children from serving.\n\nRecruiters say this reflects a growing divide between the military and civilian America — and a misunderstanding of what daily military life can entail — not just heroic Navy SEALs, or Top Gun pilots, but also equipment maintenance, human resources management, and mundane planning for those holding senior ranks.\n\nThe result of this divide, recruiters said, isn't just apathy. Three recruiters told Business Insider they've had guns pulled on them when visiting homes. One, who remains on active duty, recalled being called a \"baby killer\" and a \"slave\" to the government by an irate parent.\n\nAs phone lists falter and school access remains inconsistent — problems compounded by falling US birth rates and shrinking pools of potential recruits — recruiters are trying to meet teens where they already are: online. Social media has become a routine part of the job; artificial intelligence, meanwhile, is only beginning to surface as a potential tool.\n\nMany recruiters already use social media to connect with young people, though with varying results. Earlier this year, the Army tried partnering with influencers already in uniform to pique interest in enlistment, an effort that was halted after running into legal hurdles.\n\nWhen it comes to contacting prospective recruits through social media, some recruiters say it can feel inappropriate, acutely aware of past misconduct cases and wary of how easily online interactions can blur boundaries.\n\nAt the same time, the military's ties with Big Tech are deepening and opening new doors. A handful of leaders from Silicon Valley, including executives from Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI, were commissioned into the US Army Reserve earlier this year. It's part of a larger Army transformation effort to prepare the service for future conflicts, which some defense experts have said will require help from Silicon Valley.\n\nIn building the manpower for the future fight, leaning on emerging technology and, particularly, artificial intelligence could help recruiters identify and contact young people who may be predisposed to service, such as athletes, gamers, or those interested in science, technology, engineering, and math fields, said retired Marine Col. Bill Gray, who led recruiting efforts across the Southeast from 2018 to 2021.\n\nRecruiting has long been one of the military's toughest jobs, and when it tanks, Gray said, the answer has long been to expect recruiters to work harder, an idea that he said feels out of date with emerging technologies.\n\nOne fix, he said, could be giving recruiters access to contact information that's publicly available but not easily accessible. He recalled once watching recruiters flip through physical copies of high school yearbooks to zero in on star athletes and other standout students, a time-suck.\n\n\"It's mind-boggling to me that we are even having this conversation because of the time that could be saved,\" he said. \"You could be processing at machine speed instead of one-human speed.\"\n\nWithout a draft, increased face time with prospective recruits would be critical if the nation were to enter a large-scale war, said one senior Marine official familiar with recruiting demands who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile AI tools have the potential to make connecting with recruits easier, the official said that effort could run up against federal laws restricting the military's ability to collect or analyze data about US citizens.\n\n\"We are recruiting children,\" the official said. \"It's good that it's hard for our recruiters to find children who want to join. It should not be easy.\"\n\n\"There's a reluctance to go down some of these paths,\" Gray, the retired colonel, said. \"People say, 'Well, we're making mission, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Some recruiters say the system is breaking them — putting them under stress and threatening to derail their military careers.\n\n\"You could make life so much easier for those guys and gals,\" Gray said.",

    "title": "Pentagon Pizza Theory",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Pentagon pizza theory is the informal observation that spikes in fast food orders, particularly pizza delivery orders, near U.S. government buildings such as The Pentagon, CIA headquarters, and the White House often occur right before a major international crisis.[1]\n\nThe theory is also referred to as the Pizza Meter[2] or the Pentagon Pizza Index.[3][4]\n\nIn 1990, Frank Meeks, a Domino's franchisee in Washington, told the Los Angeles Times about an extraordinary observation of some unusual late-night deliveries to the Pentagon, CIA and the White House. Meeks had noted that on August 1, the CIA had ordered a one-night record of 21 pizzas, and the following day Iraq invaded Kuwait, starting the Gulf War.[5] At first, Meeks thought it was just a coincidence, but he observed a similar surge in deliveries in December 1998 during the impeachment hearings of Bill Clinton.[6] In response, Wolf Blitzer, CNN's Pentagon correspondent at the time, remarked \"Bottom line for journalists: Always monitor the pizzas\".[7] Similar to the Pentagon pizza observation is the observation that gay bars in Washington, D.C. see abnormally low traffic on nights that workers stay late at the Pentagon.[8]\n\nIn August 2024, an X account was created known as the \"Pentagon Pizza Report\" which monitors live visit data on Google Maps in Arlington, though it has no insight on actual order volume or where pizzas are being delivered.[8]\n\nIn 1983 and 1989, surges in pizza orders to the Pentagon were noted by Domino's franchise owner Frank Meeks the night before the U.S. military invasions of Grenada and Panama.[8] On August 1, 1990, the CIA ordered 21 pizzas in a single night ahead of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait the following morning, which sparked the Gulf War. Meeks claimed that pizza orders in the Washington area also increased prior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm in 1991.[1] In January 1998, immediately after the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal made headlines, Meeks stated the White House placed $2,600 in orders to Domino's across three days.[9] In December 1998, during the impeachment hearings of Bill Clinton and launch of Operation Desert Fox in Iraq, the White House ordered \"32 percent more extra-cheese pizzas than normal\", with $11,600 worth of orders in Capitol Hill.[9][1]\n\nOn April 13, 2024, unusually high activity at a Papa John's in Washington D.C., according to observations of Google Maps' popular times graph, coincided with Iran's launch of drones into Israeli territory.[10] On June 12, 2025, at 7 p.m. EDT, the \"Pentagon Pizza Report\" account noted a \"huge surge in activity\" in Google's live visit data at the District Pizza Palace, which is two miles (3.2 km) away from the Pentagon. At 8 p.m. EDT, Israel conducted a bombing campaign against Iran, triggering a war between the two countries.[11][12]. On June 22, 2025, at 10:38 p.m. EDT, high levels of activity were reported at a Papa John's two miles from the Pentagon one hour before Donald Trump announced U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities.[13][14]\n\nBetween the late hours of January 2 and the early morning of January 3, 2026, unusually high activity was again observed at a Papa John's near the Pentagon. This coincided with the lead-up to the United States strikes in Venezuela.[15][16] Following the strikes, President Donald Trump announced the capture of Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were subsequently flown out of the country to face narcoterrorism charges. The surge in pizza orders preceded the official confirmation of the operation by several hours, during which Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez reported the couple as missing.[17]\n\nZenobia Homan, a senior researcher at the King's College London Centre for Science and Security Studies, responded to the theory with skepticism, pointing out the potential for confirmation bias. Homan stated \"I'm not saying [the theory is] wrong, but I want to see way more data. When else do spikes occur? How often do they have absolutely nothing to do with geopolitics?\".[11]\n\nIn a statement to Newsweek in 2025, the Department of Defense denied the theory, claiming that the Pentagon has numerous internal food vendors that are available to late-night workers. It criticized the accuracy of the timeline provided by the Pentagon Pizza Report.[18][19]",

    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth aggressively jumped in to cut off Secretary of State Marco Rubio to yell at a reporter on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe two Cabinet members had just come out of a meeting to brief senators on the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and explain the path forward.\n\nRubio had been taking a series of questions from reporters when he was asked about how much involvement in Venezuela would cost U.S. taxpayers before being cut off.\n\nThe secretary of state insisted it would not cost the U.S. any money and claimed the oil deal would not either.\n\n“None of these troops sit in a dry dock waiting for action,” Rubio said. “They’re deployed somewhere in the world. If they’re not here, they’re somewhere else.”\n\nHe argued that if the ships were not in the Caribbean, they would be ”somewhere else conducting activity.”\n\nHegseth had been standing by, at times smirking, as Rubio spoke, but then he stepped forward, forcing the Secretary of State to shift aside, so he could chime in.\n\n“I want to emphasize that question from CNN,” Hegseth said, glaring at the reporter Manu Raju before launching a verbal attack.\n\n“The questions never asked how much does it cost when they’re in the Mediterranean, or the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean or the Pacific, but now that they’re in our hemisphere and a counter cartel mission or ensuring an indicted individual comes to justice, now now you’re asking the question of cost,” Hegseth raged, gesturing his hand for emphasis. “It’s a disingenuous question to begin with.”\n\nBut the defense secretary did not stop there as he continued to rant at the reporter who tried to respond.\n\n“You’re trying to find any angle possible to undermine the success of one of the most historic military missions the world has ever seen,” Hegseth declared.\n\nThe defense secretary went on to claim that the operation in Venezuela was one that only the U.S. could accomplish and argued the world is “taking notice of that.”\n\nHe went on to tout the seizure of oil tankers being pursued by the U.S.\n\nWhile Rubio had been taking questions, Hegseth ignored follow-up attempts from reporters and instead spoke louder.\n\n“Our military is prepared to continue this as he said,” Hegseth said, gesturing back to Rubio. “The president when he speaks, he means it, means it. He’s not messing around. We’re an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”\n\nHe then quickly stepped back without taking a single question as Rubio pointed out that the officials needed to go brief members of the House.\n\nHegseth ignored questions and beat a hasty retreat as questions were yelled about whether the U.S. would put boots on the ground and more.\n\nBefore the defense secretary’s rant in front of the cameras, Rubio attempted to lay out the Trump administration’s plan for Venezuela and insisted that, despite criticism, they’re not just winging it.\n\nHe outlined that stabilizing the country relied heavily on the “quarantine” as leverage and execution of a deal to take the oil out of Venezuela. He repeated the claim that the U.S. would take out 30 to 50 million barrels of oil and sell it.\n\n“That money would then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” Rubio argued.\n\nThe secretary of state said the second phase would be making sure the U.S. has access to the Venezuelan market that’s “fair.” He said the third phase would be the transition. He did not provide a timeline.\n\nDemocratic senators coming out of the briefing slammed the Trump administration’s plan and warned many questions were left unanswered.\n\n“This is an insane plan. They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,” said Senator Chris Murphy. “The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.”",

    "description": "The DF-27, a conventional strike missile believed to be able to target ships, has an estimated range that reaches parts of the continental US.",
    "fullText": "China appears to have fielded a new intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-27, which can range the continental US and, unlike other ICBMs, serve a mix of missions, including targeting ships, a new Pentagon report says.\n\nThe Department of Defense's annual report on the Chinese military, the latest of which came out last week, is the first public assessment that the missile is operational. The missile is said to have a land-attack and anti-ship role.\n\nThe latter role is unusual for an intercontinental-range ballistic missile, as is its conventional strike role documented in the new Pentagon report. ICBMs are primarily for nuclear strike.\n\nThe latest report offers little on the new missile beyond a map showing China's \"fielded conventional strike.\" The DF-27, identified as an ICBM with a range of 5,000 to 8,000 km, shorter than some other systems built for strategic nuclear strike, is a new addition to that map showing Chinese missile ranges.\n\nThat range completely covers Hawaii and Alaska, and it also extends into parts of the continental US. The exact reach might vary depending on the launch site, but broadly, the weapon puts naval forces and US military installations across the Pacific at risk in a new way.\n\nA \"long-range\" DF-27 missile was first mentioned in the 2021 Pentagon report. It said that indications on the range hinted at either an intercontinental- or intermediate-range missile. That uncertainty persisted until the 2025 report identified it as an ICBM.\n\nThe 2024 Pentagon report notably offered the most detail, stating that the DF-27 had been \"deployed\" to the Rocket Force. It added that this weapon likely has an option for an HGV, a hypersonic glide vehicle, \"as well as conventional land-attack, conventional antiship, and nuclear capabilities.\" The 2025 report, however, did not put the weapon under \"fielded nuclear capabilities.\"\n\nAccording to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, the DF-27 carries potentially significant strategic implications.\n\nIn an early assessment of the Chinese missile published two years ago, the group cited a leaked intelligence briefing indicating the missile was tested in February 2023 and warned that it could give China another means to hold targets at risk beyond the second island chain, with a high likelihood of being able to penetrate US ballistic-missile defenses and the potential to serve as a \"carrier killer.\"\n\nChina has not publicly commented on the DF-27, though local media have at times approached the topic indirectly.\n\nFielding the new DF-27 makes China the first to have an operational, conventionally armed ICBM. The US and Russia have not fielded similar capabilities; however, both have been pursuing new intermediate-range capabilities since the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the US walked away from in 2019 after accusing Russia of non-compliance.\n\nThe DF-27 is the latest example of China's efforts to develop and field varied, flexible strike options for a potential conflict. The missile branch of its military, called the People's Liberation Army's Rocket Force, has grown exponentially, and Chinese military doctrine emphasizes the need for it to possess the ability to quickly, precisely, and, in some cases, preemptively strike targets.\n\nWith the new DF-27 ICBM, \"China became the first to field an analogous capability: a conventional ICBM—with an ASBM variant—that can conduct rapid, long-range precision strikes out to intercontinental distances, including against its 'strong enemy's' homeland and its naval forces at sea,\" Andrew Erickson, a professor at the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Inistitute, wrote last week.\n\nSince the Pentagon's annual reports cover only developments from the previous year, the newest one doesn't include other notable missile developments in China from this year. An important development in September was Beijing's reveal of the DF-61 and DF-31BJ, both ICBMs, at a military parade.\n\nIt's unclear whether those missiles are operational, but even if they're still in development, the implications of the presentation in the Chinese capital are that these missiles will eventually be additions to China's already sizable land-based ICBM arsenal.",

    "fullText": "China's missile arsenal is expanding rapidly, and new maps and data from the Pentagon show its size and reach.\n\nChina's missile branch, known as the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, has seen substantial growth in recent years as Beijing builds new platforms for conventional and nuclear strike. Its capabilities threaten US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nThe latest Pentagon report on China's military offers estimates for the number of launchers and missiles in the Chinese arsenal, including the country's intercontinental ballistic missiles, key parts of its nuclear deterrent.\n\nChinese ICBMs include missiles like the DF-5 and DF-41. The Pentagon estimates China has 550 ICBM launchers and 400 missiles with estimated ranges beyond 5,500 km, the threshold for classification as an ICBM.\n\nFor China's medium-range ballistic missiles, such as China's DF-21s or hypersonic DF-17, the Pentagon assesses that China has 300 launchers for 1,300 missiles with ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 km. The report also documented increases in the number of launchers and missiles for some notable systems. China's intermediate-range ballistic missiles, like the DF-26 missile, jumped from 250 launchers in last year's report to 300 this year, and the number of IRBMs total went from 500 to 550.\n\nThese figures illustrate how heavily Beijing has invested in a powerful, diverse missile arsenal. The Pentagon highlighted in its report that the Rocket Force could play an important role in a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or other regional conflict.\n\nAccording to the latest report, China's rocket force \"is prepared to conduct missile attacks against high-value targets, including Taiwan's C2 [command and control] facilities, air bases, and radar sites\" as well as deter or delay the US or its allies and partners from coming to Taiwan's aid.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the Rocket Force has continued to rehearse strikes in recent military exercises, including 2024 drills simulating an invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nOne map in the report shows the estimated reach of Chinese missiles that could be particularly relevant in a fight over Taiwan, weapons such as ship- and shore-launched surface-to-air missiles for knocking out hostile aircraft, as well as anti-ship cruise missiles fired from naval platforms like Chinese destroyers and land-based close- and short-range ballistic missiles.\n\nAnother Pentagon map shows the estimated reach of China's conventional strike missiles, including the DF-17 and DF-21 MRBMs, the DF-26 IRBM, and the newly fielded DF-27 ICBM, which, like the DF-26 and some DF-21s, has an anti-ship role in addition to land attack.\n\nMany of these systems can reach across the first island chain, which includes Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, while longer-range missiles extend toward the second island chain and beyond.\n\nThe DF-26 is concerning for US planners. The weapon, nicknamed the \"Guam Express,\" can be armed with either conventional or nuclear warheads and reach US installations on Guam. It can target US aircraft carriers and other surface ships as well.\n\nBombers, like China's H-6, carrying CJ-20 cruise missiles could threaten parts of Alaska. And then the ICBMs can range significantly further. The DF-27 can, for instance, range parts of the continental United States.\n\nThe Department of Defense report also looks at China's nuclear strike options, such as land-based ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.\n\nChina test-launched an ICBM, specifically a DF-31B missile, in September 2024, firing it from a position on Hainan Island into the Pacific. The test was the first beyond the country's borders since the 1980s and allowed China to verify ICBM performance. The Department of Defense suspects weapons tests like these may become more regular.\n\nThis year, at a military parade in Beijing, China unveiled new, previously unseen ICBMs, shocking China watchers. Those weapons, including the new DF-61 and DF-31BJ, are not included in the Pentagon's assessments.\n\nChina also continues to bolster its nuclear warhead count, estimated at over 600 warheads. Although 2024 saw a slower rate of production than previous years, the Pentagon still assesses that the Chinese military is on its way to 1,000 warheads by 2030, only a fraction of the US and Russian stockpiles.\n\nA Pentagon map estimating the ranges of Chinese missiles available for nuclear strike indicates that three — the DF-5, DF-41, and DF-31 — all have the continental US well within range, while the submarine-launched JL-3 missile can hit most of it from waters near China. On a submarine positioned farther out, more targets could be within striking distance.\n\nDespite these continued advancements, questions remain on the differences in quality and capabilities of Chinese weapons and training compared to the US. The Pentagon also believes China is still navigating the impacts of a vast anti-corruption campaign in the military that has particularly targeted PLARF officials.\n\nThe campaign could be detrimental if driven by political agendas, or it could deliver long-term improvements if it addresses actual problems within the force. At this point, it's unclear how the changes will affect it.",

Two others were killed in the strike, and the fourth was extradited to Colombia.\n\nThe U.S. military captured Chila, then sent him back to Ecuador to be prosecuted. However, the U.S. provided the Ecuadorian government with no evidence that could lead to Chila’s arrest. Any evidence proving that Chila was committing a crime on that boat, such as seized drugs, GPS records, or cell phones, was blasted to the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe Ecuadorian government was forced to let Chila go, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe failure to even apprehend an alleged narcoterrorist is at extreme odds with the 45-year-old Defense Secretary’s tough-on-narcoterrorism rhetoric.\n\n“If these people were drug traffickers and deserving of death, how is it that you would pick them up and just let them go?” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), a member of the House intelligence and foreign affairs committees, told the Post.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We have consistently said that our intelligence did indeed confirm these boats were trafficking narcotics destined for America. That same intelligence also confirms that the individuals involved in these drug operations are/were narco-terrorists, and we stand by that assessment,” the Pentagon stated in a statement to The Post.\n\nHegseth has staked his reputation and potentially his job on the effectiveness of the boat strikes. Hegseth recently landed in hot water for an alleged “kill them all” order on a Venezuelan drug boat, killing survivors of an initial September 2 strike that critics have labeled a potential war crime.\n\nWhen reports of the order surfaced in late November, Hegseth boasted, “Biden coddled terrorists, we kill them.”\n\nThe “double tap” incident was Hegseth’s most serious controversy in a year full of embarrassments, leading to speculation he would soon face the axe.\n\nPresident Trump, 79, dumped responsibility for the attack on Hegseth, saying, “I didn’t know about the second strike. I didn’t know anything about people. I wasn’t involved.” However, he has also vocally supported Hegseth through the ordeal.",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — The four Sioux Falls public high schools are set to compete in the third annual Presidents Bowl basketball classic at the Sanford Pentagon on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nEach day of the event will feature two girls games and two boys games for a total of eight games among crosstown rivals over the two days.\n\n“They know each other really well, so they like to winning against each other so they can have bragging rights – east side, west side, whatever you want to talk about,” Jefferson head coach Tim Reck said. “It’s always fun to see those guys compete, and then afterwards, they’re laughing and joking about the game and things like that. So that’s always fun as well.”\n\nThe action begins each day at 11 a.m. with a new game tipping off every two hours. With the girls games opening the action for each session and the boys following, it creates an opportunity to draw more eye balls to the competition.\n\n“It has, like a really good crowd for us, especially with the girls games,” Washington senior forward Rylan Kennett said. “Like when there’s all the guys games going on two, it brings more people to our game. So it’s kind of nice to be able to play in an atmosphere where we can maybe get more viewers and bring more attention to girls basketball in general.”\n\nOne of the biggest draws for the players is the chance to play at the Pentagon, which is recognized as one of the best venues in the country.\n\n“The court’s very cool,” Lincoln junior guard Brody Schafer said. “It’s like a heritage look. It’s like an old style look. It’s very cool. And then it’s just the atmosphere around it – the smoke, the view board, all that stuff is stuff you don’t always get. So it’s just when you get it, you got to embrace it and take in the moment.\n\n“When they leave high school, they talk about the state tournaments, and they’re fun memories, but this is also one that they talk about as well,” Roosevelt head coach Mitch Begeman said. “They got to play on Heritage Court and in the Sanford Pentagon, and they were treated very, very well. So, I think it’s just a special two days that we get to do this. And we’re very, very appreciative of that.”\n\nThe schedule for the two days is as follows: Lincoln and Roosevelt meet in the first two games of the Presidents Bowl on Dec. 29 with Washington and Jefferson squaring off later in the day. On Dec. 30, Jefferson and Lincoln battle in the early window, and Roosevelt and Washington close out the event.",

    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog says the Army and Navy misrepresented recruit test scores, exceeding federal limits on low scorers.",
    "fullText": "A new Pentagon Inspector General report says that the Army and Navy misrepresented the academic qualifications of some recruits, allowing both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring enlistees.\n\nThe report, released earlier this month, is based on a yearlong review of the services' Future Soldier and Future Sailor preparatory courses, which are new \"pre-boot camps\" created in recent years.\n\nThe programs have helped the Army and Navy enlist more recruits amid a national recruiting crisis by taking applicants with low entrance exam scores or fitness shortfalls and aiming to prepare them for service — addressing the deficiencies — in a matter of weeks or months.\n\nThe Defense Department Inspector General found that the Army and Navy miscalculated the number of low-scoring recruits they enlisted by counting test scores earned after applicants completed the preparatory courses, rather than the scores they received before entering those programs.\n\nThat approach allowed both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring recruits without notifying the Secretary of Defense, as required by the rule. The secretary has the authority to raise those limits, but must also inform Congress.\n\nThe Pentagon disputed the report's findings, arguing that the scores that should count are those earned at the end of the preparatory courses, not those taken beforehand.\n\n\"Improving a recruit's academic skills is a primary reason for creating the [Future Soldier and Future Sailor Preparatory Courses],\" William Fitzhugh, the acting assistant secretary of defense for manpower and reserve affairs, wrote in a memo to the inspector general. \"Improved academic skills, and the resulting AFQT scores, enable such recruits to pursue a broader range of occupations, which benefits them and the Military Services.\"\n\nFederal law caps the number of recruits who score low on the Armed Forces Qualification Test, known as Category IV applicants, at 4% of the total number of recruits who ship to boot camp each year. Category IV applicants score between the 10th and 30th percentiles on the exam, which assesses subjects such as reading comprehension, math, and mechanics.\n\nSuch recruits \"tend to exhibit below average trainability and on-the-job performance,\" the report said.\n\nThe cap is intended to ensure the services attract enough high-scoring recruits to fill technically demanding roles, such as cyber operations, intelligence, and special operations, as well as many logistics and administrative jobs that also require strong academic performance.\n\nHad the services used applicants' original test scores, the Navy would have classified more than 11% of its 2025 enlistments as Category IV recruits, compared with just over 7% when counting scores earned after the preparatory course. The Army also exceeded 10% of Category IV recruits, though the report did not say by how much.\n\nThe findings come as the Army and Navy begin to emerge from a yearslong recruiting crisis that left both services thousands of recruits short in recent years. Nearly three-quarters of American youth do not meet either the military's fitness or its academic requirements to qualify for service, and fewer than ever are likely to consider military careers, making innovative recruiting efforts critical.\n\nA previous inspector general report raised concerns about \"less restrictive testing standards\" in the Army's preparatory course and found that some participants struggled with English as a second language. The Pentagon also disputed those findings.",

    "description": "The Defense Department wants troops to have new weapons quickly. But testing processes don't include the best ways to do that, a new report documents.",
    "fullText": "The Pentagon wants to get troops new weapons faster, but its testing isn't following best practices, according to a new government watchdog report.\n\nCurrent policies have often focused on looking for problems after weapons are already developed, slowing down the process. Policy changes, the report concluded, would ultimately help the Department of Defense achieve the speed and modernization it is looking for.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said the Pentagon needed to get testers involved early on, conduct iterative testing to find problems quickly and results in gradual changes, use digital twins to mirror actual physical systems, and seek regular user feedback.\n\nThese are key principles followed by companies for product development and they are applicable to the US military as it seeks to update its policies for faster, better weapons. Currently, GAO reporting indicates, the DoD implementation appears haphazard and sloppy.\n\nFor example, the development of the Air Force's new pilot training aircraft, the T-7A Red Hawk, didn't include allowing testers to access test data in a timely manner, and the contract didn't require a complete digital system model of system. And upgrades for the F-22 Raptor haven't considered how user feedback could be incorporated into an iterative testing process.\n\nWithout revising these development and design policies, \"the Air Force is missing opportunities to ensure that testing proceeds expeditiously and that the systems under test are responsive and relevant to warfighter needs,\" the GAO said.\n\nIn the Army, the new MV-75 Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft, which will eventually replace the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, hasn't followed an iterative design approach. That could've resulted in tailoring testing to different changes in the aircraft's development, which could've gotten the system to pilots quicker, the watchdog office determined.\n\nAnd then the Navy, the GAO report said, only followed an iterative design process on its Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers for cybersecurity and didn't have a digital twin.\n\nReviews of the Department of Defense policies ultimately led the GAO to issue 13 recommendations, including that officials revise how they evaluate weapons and align their plans with better practices. The GAO said the Pentagon fully agreed with seven of those, partially agreed with five, and didn't concur with one.\n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBroadly, the defense department faces a choice, the report concluded. \"On the one hand, it could continue to treat test and evaluation as a means of identifying deficiencies in weapon systems already developed and, often, already produced,\" it said. That wouldn't require any changes to the status quo but wouldn't help the Pentagon get weapons to troops faster.\n\n\"On the other hand, DoD has an opportunity to embrace test and evaluation as a core foundation of every weapon systems acquisition program,\" the GAO report added, which would be a significant change in the short term but position the department to \"ensure that warfighter needs are consistently understood, prioritized, and met\" in the long term.\n\nHow the Pentagon builds weapons is undergoing a shift as department leadership under the Trump administration seeks to speed up the process and get new technologies to troops quickly. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo directing the department to modernize its testing, reduce test oversight, and streamline requirements.\n\n\"Speed to capability delivery is now our organizing principle: the decisive factor in maintaining deterrence and warfighting advantage,\" Hegseth wrote.\n\nEarlier this year, Hegseth gutted the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, which independently supervises the performance of weapons before they're given to US military personnel, decreasing the number of programs it oversees.\n\nHegseth said the cuts reduced bureaucracy and allowed for more rapid deployment of new weapons. Oversight experts, however, raised concerns that the cuts to DOT&E could put troops in danger and mean problems aren't identified before they hit the field.",

    "fullText": "Senate Republicans are growing increasingly uneasy with the Pentagon’s investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced his office is escalating its probe into him.\n\nThe Defense Department announced Monday the review of Kelly has risen to an “official Command Investigation,” intensifying the feud between the two sides over Kelly’s role in a video he and other congressional Democrats made to remind service members of their duty to disobey illegal orders.\n\nThe news has also given a number of Republicans pause as they question whether this is a prudent decision by the Pentagon against one of their colleagues.\n\n“I think it’s a terrible idea,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said.\n\nPaul was one of five Senate GOP members who expressed reservations about the Hegseth-led investigation into Kelly, a retired Navy captain.\n\nKelly has been under fire by the administration for nearly a month after he, Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Democratic Reps. Jason Crow (Colo.), Chris Deluzio (Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (N.H.) and Chrissy Houlahan (Pa.) appeared in the video that set off the series of comments.\n\nTrump also called for the execution of the half-dozen lawmakers — a remark he walked back.\n\nDays after the Democrats released the joint video, the Defense Department said it received “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly and that it kicked off a “thorough review” of the allegations. Hegseth ordered the Navy to finish the review and submit it to the Defense Department by Dec. 10.\n\nThe Navy submitted the report on potential punishments against Kelly to the department’s Office of General Counsel last week. The content and the scope of the report are unclear.\n\nWhat isn’t being walked back is the probe, which some Senate Republicans believe likely does not have merit.\n\n“I’m not,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said when asked whether she is comfortable with the expansion of the probe. “He is protected by the speech and debate clause.”\n\nHegseth appeared Tuesday on Capitol Hill alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio to brief lawmakers on the administration’s targeting of boats near Venezuela. Hegseth and Kelly got into a “long back-and-forth” during the briefing, according to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).\n\nAccording to one Senate Republican, the spat started with a reasonable question on Kelly’s end but eventually turned into a protracted discussion with GOP members complaining he was “filibustering” during a classified briefing when other attendees had questions.\n\nKelly said Hegseth brought up “talking points” about the video when he was asking the Pentagon chief about the strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.\n\n“I think, with regards to me, [Hegseth] kind of walked in there with a little speech that he wanted to give,” Kelly said after the briefing, adding, “I’m not going to waste my colleagues’ time with something that is specific to me.”\n\nKelly told reporters following the briefing the Pentagon still has not reached out to him about the investigation and argued the department is targeting him “for something I said that was lawful.”\n\n“This is all a bunch of bulls‑‑‑, and the reason why, I think, is because this is just about sending a message to retired service members, active duty service members, government employees: Do not speak out against this president, or there will be consequences,” he said.\n\nPaul Fishman, Kelly’s lawyer, warned that action by the Pentagon against the Democrat “would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power.”\n\n“If the executive branch were to move forward in any forum — criminal, disciplinary, or administrative — we will take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach,” Fishman wrote.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the Pentagon said it did not have further remarks and referred The Hill to Monday’s statement.\n\nSenate GOP members are concerned Hegseth’s actions are setting a precedent that could boomerang on Republicans.\n\n“These members are going to be here after this administration’s gone. We’re creating a precedent that everybody should expect could be used against them,” one GOP senator told The Hill.\n\n“Yeah — he made a video,” they continued. “But I don’t think it rises to the level that they’re trying to make it. It really seems to me like vindictive prosecutions, and that’s a bad message to send to the American people.”\n\nKelly is the only one of the six lawmakers who falls under the Defense Department’s purview. Four of the others are former military members but are not retired like Kelly is. Slotkin is an ex-CIA official.\n\nEven some Republicans who are more ardent supporters of the president indicated they have questions about whether the investigation is warranted.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters he didn’t believe taking part in the video was “very wise” on Kelly’s part.\n\n“But I don’t know if it broke any laws,” he added.\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a retired Marine, similarly criticized Kelly’s participation. Nevertheless, he cautioned he believes the investigation is not a “good use of the Pentagon’s time.”\n\n“While Senator Sullivan believes the message in the video was irresponsible and politically driven, he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly — who served honorably in the Navy — under the UCMJ [Uniform Code of Military Justice], particularly given that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause would likely take precedence over any UCMJ provision,” a spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement.\n\n“Such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military,” they continued. “After four years of Biden’s woke military, the Department of War needs to stay laser focused on lethality and war fighting.”",

    "fullText": "Pentagon leadership's intensifying scrutiny of speech that is critical of conservatives and the Trump administration is fueling anxiety in the ranks and has some service members scrambling to protect their careers.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, troops and legal advisors detailed how behavior has changed amid the recent crackdown, which has some facing administrative actions that can end a career without a court-martial.\n\n\"I had to take my pronouns off my LinkedIn. I've scrubbed everything that has ever mentioned or supported\" LGBTQ causes, the Marine sergeant told Business Insider. She said her mentor warned that Pentagon officials may be looking for \"anything that could be construed as contrary to the vision that the current administration has.\"\n\nThese individual acts of self-censorship mirror a broader chill sweeping the ranks, especially as the crackdown has burst into the open at the highest levels. Tensions flared again this week as the Defense Department said it was launching a command investigation of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly after a preliminary review of his video urging troops to defy unlawful orders.\n\nThe Trump administration says it has a prerogative to police speech it deems offensive or inappropriate, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the administration's policies are intended \"to rip out the politics\" from the services. Some experts on military law say the scrutiny and its repercussions are an abuse of the military's authority.\n\nOne of the flashpoints has been the September murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Top Pentagon leaders have said it's \"unacceptable\" for troops \"to celebrate or mock\" the killing.\n\nAfter Kirk's killing, some service members said things online like \"glad he's dead.\" Others criticized his rhetoric or, more broadly, complained about Trump administration policies or conservatives. In one case, a colonel was suspended for lamenting to friends the angry arguments that followed Kirk's death.\n\nMore than 120 service members have been investigated for political comments since Kirk's death, according to a tally reported by The Washington Post.\n\nNearly a dozen military-law experts told Business Insider the punishments generally wouldn't hold up in a military courtroom because they lack the elements of speech crimes, such as \"contemptuous\" words against an elected leader, or because the comments were unrelated to the military and not said in uniform.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is abuse of speech restrictions,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a Southwestern Law School professor and retired Air Force JAG who is an expert on military speech.\n\n\"Our service members understand that their rights are more restricted within the military. Now they're being chilled into giving up the rights they actually do have,\" she said. \"It's unprecedented.\"\n\nMilitary leaders have disclosed that they are tracking \"unprofessional\" social media use. An October message from the Navy secretary encouraged sailors and Marines to \"refrain from social media engagement\" about official government or military policies.\n\n\"This is more than just policing manners,\" said Frank Rosenblatt, a professor at the Mississippi College School of Law and a retired Army JAG. \"A wider muzzling of the military seems to really serve what they're trying to do — identify these deep state people who are not politically trustworthy.\"\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice imposes some restrictions on troops, criminalizing speech that disrespects officers and civilian leaders, or that undermines the obedience necessary to carry out orders. Troops retain many First Amendment protections; hate speech, for instance, is lawful unless it has a military connection, such as if it was uttered on a base or warship.\n\nThe hunt for speech crimes is fueling suspicion and distrust among some. The field-grade officer who shut down her Facebook said she now worries that a casual remark could brand her as liberal and thus politically suspect.\n\nShe has begun scrutinizing parts of her career she never imagined — where her office is located, who works nearby, whether to respond to articles shared in group chats, and even whether to travel with coworkers she doesn't know well.\n\n\"It just takes one person to flag you as disloyal to end your career — or worse,\" said the officer, who asked for anonymity to avoid official retaliation.\n\nDon C. King, a civilian defense attorney, said he got a call recently from a worried service member. They'd written a social media post critical of the Trump administration's lethal attacks on suspected drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela. Someone at their command saw it and told them, \"'Hey, you better be careful with your social media.'\"\n\n\"I've been in the military my entire adult life, over 30 years, and I've never seen any of the services or DoD scout social media for what it considers to be inappropriate speech,\" said King, who retired as a Navy JAG in 2022 and owns the King Military Law firm specializing in military clients.\n\nThe allegations against rank-and-file troops are unfolding in the military's administrative system, which can discipline troops and end careers outside of public court proceedings.\n\n\"These cases are early, and both the government and the affected individuals are figuring out how they want to fight,\" said Eugene R. Fidell, an influential military law expert and senior research scholar at Yale. \"The simple wear and tear of having to defend and try to overturn one of these administrative sanctions is itself a punishment.\"\n\nFirst Amendment restrictions on troops stem from the military's apolitical role and its reliance on obedience to orders. Officers can face criminal penalties for \"contemptuous\" words about the president, as can all personnel for disrespecting a senior officer. However, troops can comment politically, donate to a campaign, or display bumper stickers. Their protections are strongest when their comments are in a personal capacity, made out of uniform and without any hint of official endorsement.\n\nSocial media can amplify a service member's comments far beyond a bumper sticker, regardless of intention. That poses higher risks that the military as an institution could be seen as backing a political party or objective, said Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University who authored a 2023 book, \"Thanks For Your Service,\" about how high confidence in the military has depended on beliefs about its competence and its avoidance of partisan politics.\n\n\"The military is becoming combatants in the culture wars,\" he said. Part of the way to change that, he said, \"requires the military not to sound like they're culture warriors.\"\n\n\"So you may have a right to say it, but it wouldn't be right to say it,\" he added.\n\nMilitary law criminalizes conduct that disgraces an officer or damages good order and discipline; however, case law has set a high bar when the conduct at issue is purely private speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBrent Sadler, a defense expert at a leading conservative think tank, said speech monitoring is justified to enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\n\"The issue is more about professionalism and protecting any appearance of the military interfering with political-civil control,\" said Sadler, a retired Navy captain and senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"I do think numerous conservatives in the military have been persecuted legally and professionally,\" he said, pointing to the 8,000 troops kicked out for refusing the COVID vaccine mandate before the Pentagon rescinded it in 2023.\n\nMark Jensen, a former Army JAG who retired earlier this year, said the Pentagon's policing has expanded over the past few months from \"despicable\" speech about Kirk, to rebukes of his politics, to advocacy for transgender people, to criticism of the Trump administration.\n\nJensen represents four military clients and a civilian who face punishment for their speech. The fact that some of the allegations are public is the result of an anti-\"woke\" online army that publishes hearsay and leaked comments on sites like X.\n\nOn top of being \"smeared,\" Jensen said, these troops undergo the stress of an investigation, a relief if they're in leadership, a poor evaluation, a reprimand by a general, and face a review that can reduce their rank.\n\n\"It's like a 1-2-3-4-5 punch,\" Jensen said. \"All of it with minimal due process.\"\n\nKelly is not the only veteran to unexpectedly face punishment. In one recent case, an ex-soldier on the inactive reserve — a roster of those who can be reactivated in a national emergency — told a civilian attorney he was investigated by military officials for a private social media post, the attorney said.\n\n\"Even when people are in the normal reserves, the regulations are pretty clear that conduct in a civilian capacity shouldn't be punished in a military capacity,\" said Cody Harnish, a private defense attorney and former Army JAG who specializes in UCMJ cases.\n\n\"They're way out of their depth here.\"\n\nStaff writer Kelsey Baker contributed to this report.",
