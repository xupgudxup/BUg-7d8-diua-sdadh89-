    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog says the Army and Navy misrepresented recruit test scores, exceeding federal limits on low scorers.",
    "fullText": "A new Pentagon Inspector General report says that the Army and Navy misrepresented the academic qualifications of some recruits, allowing both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring enlistees.\n\nThe report, released earlier this month, is based on a yearlong review of the services' Future Soldier and Future Sailor preparatory courses, which are new \"pre-boot camps\" created in recent years.\n\nThe programs have helped the Army and Navy enlist more recruits amid a national recruiting crisis by taking applicants with low entrance exam scores or fitness shortfalls and aiming to prepare them for service — addressing the deficiencies — in a matter of weeks or months.\n\nThe Defense Department Inspector General found that the Army and Navy miscalculated the number of low-scoring recruits they enlisted by counting test scores earned after applicants completed the preparatory courses, rather than the scores they received before entering those programs.\n\nThat approach allowed both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring recruits without notifying the Secretary of Defense, as required by the rule. The secretary has the authority to raise those limits, but must also inform Congress.\n\nThe Pentagon disputed the report's findings, arguing that the scores that should count are those earned at the end of the preparatory courses, not those taken beforehand.\n\n\"Improving a recruit's academic skills is a primary reason for creating the [Future Soldier and Future Sailor Preparatory Courses],\" William Fitzhugh, the acting assistant secretary of defense for manpower and reserve affairs, wrote in a memo to the inspector general. \"Improved academic skills, and the resulting AFQT scores, enable such recruits to pursue a broader range of occupations, which benefits them and the Military Services.\"\n\nFederal law caps the number of recruits who score low on the Armed Forces Qualification Test, known as Category IV applicants, at 4% of the total number of recruits who ship to boot camp each year. Category IV applicants score between the 10th and 30th percentiles on the exam, which assesses subjects such as reading comprehension, math, and mechanics.\n\nSuch recruits \"tend to exhibit below average trainability and on-the-job performance,\" the report said.\n\nThe cap is intended to ensure the services attract enough high-scoring recruits to fill technically demanding roles, such as cyber operations, intelligence, and special operations, as well as many logistics and administrative jobs that also require strong academic performance.\n\nHad the services used applicants' original test scores, the Navy would have classified more than 11% of its 2025 enlistments as Category IV recruits, compared with just over 7% when counting scores earned after the preparatory course. The Army also exceeded 10% of Category IV recruits, though the report did not say by how much.\n\nThe findings come as the Army and Navy begin to emerge from a yearslong recruiting crisis that left both services thousands of recruits short in recent years. Nearly three-quarters of American youth do not meet either the military's fitness or its academic requirements to qualify for service, and fewer than ever are likely to consider military careers, making innovative recruiting efforts critical.\n\nA previous inspector general report raised concerns about \"less restrictive testing standards\" in the Army's preparatory course and found that some participants struggled with English as a second language. The Pentagon also disputed those findings.",

    "description": "The Defense Department wants troops to have new weapons quickly. But testing processes don't include the best ways to do that, a new report documents.",
    "fullText": "The Pentagon wants to get troops new weapons faster, but its testing isn't following best practices, according to a new government watchdog report.\n\nCurrent policies have often focused on looking for problems after weapons are already developed, slowing down the process. Policy changes, the report concluded, would ultimately help the Department of Defense achieve the speed and modernization it is looking for.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said the Pentagon needed to get testers involved early on, conduct iterative testing to find problems quickly and results in gradual changes, use digital twins to mirror actual physical systems, and seek regular user feedback.\n\nThese are key principles followed by companies for product development and they are applicable to the US military as it seeks to update its policies for faster, better weapons. Currently, GAO reporting indicates, the DoD implementation appears haphazard and sloppy.\n\nFor example, the development of the Air Force's new pilot training aircraft, the T-7A Red Hawk, didn't include allowing testers to access test data in a timely manner, and the contract didn't require a complete digital system model of system. And upgrades for the F-22 Raptor haven't considered how user feedback could be incorporated into an iterative testing process.\n\nWithout revising these development and design policies, \"the Air Force is missing opportunities to ensure that testing proceeds expeditiously and that the systems under test are responsive and relevant to warfighter needs,\" the GAO said.\n\nIn the Army, the new MV-75 Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft, which will eventually replace the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, hasn't followed an iterative design approach. That could've resulted in tailoring testing to different changes in the aircraft's development, which could've gotten the system to pilots quicker, the watchdog office determined.\n\nAnd then the Navy, the GAO report said, only followed an iterative design process on its Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers for cybersecurity and didn't have a digital twin.\n\nReviews of the Department of Defense policies ultimately led the GAO to issue 13 recommendations, including that officials revise how they evaluate weapons and align their plans with better practices. The GAO said the Pentagon fully agreed with seven of those, partially agreed with five, and didn't concur with one.\n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBroadly, the defense department faces a choice, the report concluded. \"On the one hand, it could continue to treat test and evaluation as a means of identifying deficiencies in weapon systems already developed and, often, already produced,\" it said. That wouldn't require any changes to the status quo but wouldn't help the Pentagon get weapons to troops faster.\n\n\"On the other hand, DoD has an opportunity to embrace test and evaluation as a core foundation of every weapon systems acquisition program,\" the GAO report added, which would be a significant change in the short term but position the department to \"ensure that warfighter needs are consistently understood, prioritized, and met\" in the long term.\n\nHow the Pentagon builds weapons is undergoing a shift as department leadership under the Trump administration seeks to speed up the process and get new technologies to troops quickly. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo directing the department to modernize its testing, reduce test oversight, and streamline requirements.\n\n\"Speed to capability delivery is now our organizing principle: the decisive factor in maintaining deterrence and warfighting advantage,\" Hegseth wrote.\n\nEarlier this year, Hegseth gutted the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, which independently supervises the performance of weapons before they're given to US military personnel, decreasing the number of programs it oversees.\n\nHegseth said the cuts reduced bureaucracy and allowed for more rapid deployment of new weapons. Oversight experts, however, raised concerns that the cuts to DOT&E could put troops in danger and mean problems aren't identified before they hit the field.",

    "fullText": "Senate Republicans are growing increasingly uneasy with the Pentagon’s investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced his office is escalating its probe into him.\n\nThe Defense Department announced Monday the review of Kelly has risen to an “official Command Investigation,” intensifying the feud between the two sides over Kelly’s role in a video he and other congressional Democrats made to remind service members of their duty to disobey illegal orders.\n\nThe news has also given a number of Republicans pause as they question whether this is a prudent decision by the Pentagon against one of their colleagues.\n\n“I think it’s a terrible idea,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said.\n\nPaul was one of five Senate GOP members who expressed reservations about the Hegseth-led investigation into Kelly, a retired Navy captain.\n\nKelly has been under fire by the administration for nearly a month after he, Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Democratic Reps. Jason Crow (Colo.), Chris Deluzio (Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (N.H.) and Chrissy Houlahan (Pa.) appeared in the video that set off the series of comments.\n\nTrump also called for the execution of the half-dozen lawmakers — a remark he walked back.\n\nDays after the Democrats released the joint video, the Defense Department said it received “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly and that it kicked off a “thorough review” of the allegations. Hegseth ordered the Navy to finish the review and submit it to the Defense Department by Dec. 10.\n\nThe Navy submitted the report on potential punishments against Kelly to the department’s Office of General Counsel last week. The content and the scope of the report are unclear.\n\nWhat isn’t being walked back is the probe, which some Senate Republicans believe likely does not have merit.\n\n“I’m not,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said when asked whether she is comfortable with the expansion of the probe. “He is protected by the speech and debate clause.”\n\nHegseth appeared Tuesday on Capitol Hill alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio to brief lawmakers on the administration’s targeting of boats near Venezuela. Hegseth and Kelly got into a “long back-and-forth” during the briefing, according to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).\n\nAccording to one Senate Republican, the spat started with a reasonable question on Kelly’s end but eventually turned into a protracted discussion with GOP members complaining he was “filibustering” during a classified briefing when other attendees had questions.\n\nKelly said Hegseth brought up “talking points” about the video when he was asking the Pentagon chief about the strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.\n\n“I think, with regards to me, [Hegseth] kind of walked in there with a little speech that he wanted to give,” Kelly said after the briefing, adding, “I’m not going to waste my colleagues’ time with something that is specific to me.”\n\nKelly told reporters following the briefing the Pentagon still has not reached out to him about the investigation and argued the department is targeting him “for something I said that was lawful.”\n\n“This is all a bunch of bulls‑‑‑, and the reason why, I think, is because this is just about sending a message to retired service members, active duty service members, government employees: Do not speak out against this president, or there will be consequences,” he said.\n\nPaul Fishman, Kelly’s lawyer, warned that action by the Pentagon against the Democrat “would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power.”\n\n“If the executive branch were to move forward in any forum — criminal, disciplinary, or administrative — we will take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach,” Fishman wrote.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the Pentagon said it did not have further remarks and referred The Hill to Monday’s statement.\n\nSenate GOP members are concerned Hegseth’s actions are setting a precedent that could boomerang on Republicans.\n\n“These members are going to be here after this administration’s gone. We’re creating a precedent that everybody should expect could be used against them,” one GOP senator told The Hill.\n\n“Yeah — he made a video,” they continued. “But I don’t think it rises to the level that they’re trying to make it. It really seems to me like vindictive prosecutions, and that’s a bad message to send to the American people.”\n\nKelly is the only one of the six lawmakers who falls under the Defense Department’s purview. Four of the others are former military members but are not retired like Kelly is. Slotkin is an ex-CIA official.\n\nEven some Republicans who are more ardent supporters of the president indicated they have questions about whether the investigation is warranted.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters he didn’t believe taking part in the video was “very wise” on Kelly’s part.\n\n“But I don’t know if it broke any laws,” he added.\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a retired Marine, similarly criticized Kelly’s participation. Nevertheless, he cautioned he believes the investigation is not a “good use of the Pentagon’s time.”\n\n“While Senator Sullivan believes the message in the video was irresponsible and politically driven, he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly — who served honorably in the Navy — under the UCMJ [Uniform Code of Military Justice], particularly given that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause would likely take precedence over any UCMJ provision,” a spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement.\n\n“Such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military,” they continued. “After four years of Biden’s woke military, the Department of War needs to stay laser focused on lethality and war fighting.”",

    "description": "The Pentagon is policing troops' speech in ways experts call an \"abuse.\" Some service members are self-censoring and scrambling to scrub social media.",
    "fullText": "Pentagon leadership's intensifying scrutiny of speech that is critical of conservatives and the Trump administration is fueling anxiety in the ranks and has some service members scrambling to protect their careers.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, troops and legal advisors detailed how behavior has changed amid the recent crackdown, which has some facing administrative actions that can end a career without a court-martial.\n\n\"I had to take my pronouns off my LinkedIn. I've scrubbed everything that has ever mentioned or supported\" LGBTQ causes, the Marine sergeant told Business Insider. She said her mentor warned that Pentagon officials may be looking for \"anything that could be construed as contrary to the vision that the current administration has.\"\n\nThese individual acts of self-censorship mirror a broader chill sweeping the ranks, especially as the crackdown has burst into the open at the highest levels. Tensions flared again this week as the Defense Department said it was launching a command investigation of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly after a preliminary review of his video urging troops to defy unlawful orders.\n\nThe Trump administration says it has a prerogative to police speech it deems offensive or inappropriate, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the administration's policies are intended \"to rip out the politics\" from the services. Some experts on military law say the scrutiny and its repercussions are an abuse of the military's authority.\n\nOne of the flashpoints has been the September murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Top Pentagon leaders have said it's \"unacceptable\" for troops \"to celebrate or mock\" the killing.\n\nAfter Kirk's killing, some service members said things online like \"glad he's dead.\" Others criticized his rhetoric or, more broadly, complained about Trump administration policies or conservatives. In one case, a colonel was suspended for lamenting to friends the angry arguments that followed Kirk's death.\n\nMore than 120 service members have been investigated for political comments since Kirk's death, according to a tally reported by The Washington Post.\n\nNearly a dozen military-law experts told Business Insider the punishments generally wouldn't hold up in a military courtroom because they lack the elements of speech crimes, such as \"contemptuous\" words against an elected leader, or because the comments were unrelated to the military and not said in uniform.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is abuse of speech restrictions,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a Southwestern Law School professor and retired Air Force JAG who is an expert on military speech.\n\n\"Our service members understand that their rights are more restricted within the military. Now they're being chilled into giving up the rights they actually do have,\" she said. \"It's unprecedented.\"\n\nMilitary leaders have disclosed that they are tracking \"unprofessional\" social media use. An October message from the Navy secretary encouraged sailors and Marines to \"refrain from social media engagement\" about official government or military policies.\n\n\"This is more than just policing manners,\" said Frank Rosenblatt, a professor at the Mississippi College School of Law and a retired Army JAG. \"A wider muzzling of the military seems to really serve what they're trying to do — identify these deep state people who are not politically trustworthy.\"\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice imposes some restrictions on troops, criminalizing speech that disrespects officers and civilian leaders, or that undermines the obedience necessary to carry out orders. Troops retain many First Amendment protections; hate speech, for instance, is lawful unless it has a military connection, such as if it was uttered on a base or warship.\n\nThe hunt for speech crimes is fueling suspicion and distrust among some. The field-grade officer who shut down her Facebook said she now worries that a casual remark could brand her as liberal and thus politically suspect.\n\nShe has begun scrutinizing parts of her career she never imagined — where her office is located, who works nearby, whether to respond to articles shared in group chats, and even whether to travel with coworkers she doesn't know well.\n\n\"It just takes one person to flag you as disloyal to end your career — or worse,\" said the officer, who asked for anonymity to avoid official retaliation.\n\nDon C. King, a civilian defense attorney, said he got a call recently from a worried service member. They'd written a social media post critical of the Trump administration's lethal attacks on suspected drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela. Someone at their command saw it and told them, \"'Hey, you better be careful with your social media.'\"\n\n\"I've been in the military my entire adult life, over 30 years, and I've never seen any of the services or DoD scout social media for what it considers to be inappropriate speech,\" said King, who retired as a Navy JAG in 2022 and owns the King Military Law firm specializing in military clients.\n\nThe allegations against rank-and-file troops are unfolding in the military's administrative system, which can discipline troops and end careers outside of public court proceedings.\n\n\"These cases are early, and both the government and the affected individuals are figuring out how they want to fight,\" said Eugene R. Fidell, an influential military law expert and senior research scholar at Yale. \"The simple wear and tear of having to defend and try to overturn one of these administrative sanctions is itself a punishment.\"\n\nFirst Amendment restrictions on troops stem from the military's apolitical role and its reliance on obedience to orders. Officers can face criminal penalties for \"contemptuous\" words about the president, as can all personnel for disrespecting a senior officer. However, troops can comment politically, donate to a campaign, or display bumper stickers. Their protections are strongest when their comments are in a personal capacity, made out of uniform and without any hint of official endorsement.\n\nSocial media can amplify a service member's comments far beyond a bumper sticker, regardless of intention. That poses higher risks that the military as an institution could be seen as backing a political party or objective, said Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University who authored a 2023 book, \"Thanks For Your Service,\" about how high confidence in the military has depended on beliefs about its competence and its avoidance of partisan politics.\n\n\"The military is becoming combatants in the culture wars,\" he said. Part of the way to change that, he said, \"requires the military not to sound like they're culture warriors.\"\n\n\"So you may have a right to say it, but it wouldn't be right to say it,\" he added.\n\nMilitary law criminalizes conduct that disgraces an officer or damages good order and discipline; however, case law has set a high bar when the conduct at issue is purely private speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBrent Sadler, a defense expert at a leading conservative think tank, said speech monitoring is justified to enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\n\"The issue is more about professionalism and protecting any appearance of the military interfering with political-civil control,\" said Sadler, a retired Navy captain and senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"I do think numerous conservatives in the military have been persecuted legally and professionally,\" he said, pointing to the 8,000 troops kicked out for refusing the COVID vaccine mandate before the Pentagon rescinded it in 2023.\n\nMark Jensen, a former Army JAG who retired earlier this year, said the Pentagon's policing has expanded over the past few months from \"despicable\" speech about Kirk, to rebukes of his politics, to advocacy for transgender people, to criticism of the Trump administration.\n\nJensen represents four military clients and a civilian who face punishment for their speech. The fact that some of the allegations are public is the result of an anti-\"woke\" online army that publishes hearsay and leaked comments on sites like X.\n\nOn top of being \"smeared,\" Jensen said, these troops undergo the stress of an investigation, a relief if they're in leadership, a poor evaluation, a reprimand by a general, and face a review that can reduce their rank.\n\n\"It's like a 1-2-3-4-5 punch,\" Jensen said. \"All of it with minimal due process.\"\n\nKelly is not the only veteran to unexpectedly face punishment. In one recent case, an ex-soldier on the inactive reserve — a roster of those who can be reactivated in a national emergency — told a civilian attorney he was investigated by military officials for a private social media post, the attorney said.\n\n\"Even when people are in the normal reserves, the regulations are pretty clear that conduct in a civilian capacity shouldn't be punished in a military capacity,\" said Cody Harnish, a private defense attorney and former Army JAG who specializes in UCMJ cases.\n\n\"They're way out of their depth here.\"\n\nStaff writer Kelsey Baker contributed to this report.",
