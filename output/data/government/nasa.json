    "fullText": "There is no GPS at the Red Planet, but a new technology called Mars Global Localization lets Perseverance determine precisely where it is — without human help.\n\nImagine you’re all alone, driving along in a rocky, unforgiving desert with no roads, no map, no GPS, and no more than one phone call a day for someone to inform you exactly where you are. That’s what NASA’s Perseverance rover has been experiencing since landing on Mars five years ago. Though it carries time-tested tools for determining its general location, the rover has needed operators on Earth to tell it precisely where it is — until now.\n\nA new technology developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California enables Perseverance to figure out its whereabouts without calling humans for help. Dubbed Mars Global Localization, the technology features an algorithm that rapidly compares panoramic images from the rover’s navigation cameras with onboard orbital terrain maps. Running on a powerful processor that Perseverance originally used to communicate with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, the algorithm takes about two minutes to pinpoint the rover’s location within some 10 inches (25 centimeters). Mars Global Localization was first used successfully in regular mission operations on Feb. 2, then again Feb. 16.\n\n“This is kind of like giving the rover GPS. Now it can determine its own location on Mars,” said JPL’s Vandi Verma, chief engineer of robotics operations for the mission. “It means the rover will be able to drive for much longer distances autonomously, so we’ll explore more of the planet and get more science. And it could be used by almost any other rover traveling fast and far.”\n\nThe upgrade is especially valuable given how well Perseverance’s auto-navigation self-driving system has been working. Enabling the rover to re-plan its path around obstacles en route to a preestablished destination, AutoNav has proved so capable that the distance Perseverance can drive without instructions from Earth is largely limited by the rover’s uncertainty about its whereabouts. Now that it can stop and determine its exact location, Perseverance can be commanded to drive to potentially unlimited distances without calling home.  Implementation of Mars Global Localization comes on the heels of another innovation from the Perseverance team: the first use of generative artificial intelligence to help plan a drive route by selecting waypoints for the rover, which are normally chosen by human rover operators. Both technologies enable Perseverance to travel farther and faster while minimizing team workload.\n\nUnlike on Earth, there is no network of GPS satellites in deep space to locate spacecraft on planetary surfaces. So missions — whether robotic or crewed — must come up with other ways to determine their location.\n\nAs with NASA’s previous Mars rovers, Perseverance tracks its position using what’s called visual odometry, analyzing geologic features in camera images taken every few feet while accounting for wheel slippage. But as tiny errors in the process add up over the course of each drive, the rover becomes increasingly unsure about its exact location. On long drives, the rover’s sense of its position can be off by more than 100 feet (up to 35 meters). Believing it may be too close to hazardous terrain, Perseverance may prematurely end its drive and wait for instructions from Earth.\n\n“Humans have to tell it, ‘You’re not lost, you’re safe. Keep going,’” Verma said. “We knew if we addressed this problem, the rover could travel much farther every day.”\n\nAfter each drive comes to a halt, the rover sends a 360-degree panorama to Earth, where mapping experts match the imagery with shots from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The team then sends the rover its location and instructions for its next drive. That process can take a day or more, but with Mars Global Localization, the rover is able to compare the images itself, determine its location, and roll ahead on its preplanned route.\n\n“We’ve given the rover a new ability,” said Jeremy Nash, a JPL robotics engineer who led the team working on the project under Verma. “This has been an open problem in robotics research for decades, and it’s been super exciting to deploy this solution in space for the first time.”\n\nThe small team began working in 2023, testing the accuracy of the algorithm they’d developed using data from 264 previous rover stops. The algorithm compared rover panoramic photos to MRO imagery and correctly pinpointed the rover’s location for every single stop.\n\nKey to Mars Global Localization is the rover’s Helicopter Base Station (HBS), which Perseverance used to communicate with the now-retired Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. Equipped with a commercial processor that powered many consumer smartphones in the mid-2010s, the HBS runs more than 100 times faster than the rover’s two main computers, which, built to survive the radiation-heavy Martian environment, are based on hardware introduced in 1997.\n\nAs a technology demonstration designed to test capabilities, the Ingenuity mission was able to risk employing more powerful commercial chips in the HBS and the helicopter even though they hadn’t been proven in space. It paid off: Expected to fly no more than five times, the rotorcraft completed 72 flights.\n\nThe power of the HBS processor inspired Verma to look for ways the Perseverance mission might harness it. “It’s almost like a gift. Ingenuity blazed the trail, proving we could use commercial processors on Mars,” Verma said.\n\nTapping into the HBS computer has had its challenges. To address reliability, the team developed a “sanity check”: The algorithm runs on the HBS multiple times before one of the rover’s main computers checks to ensure the results match. During testing, the team repeatedly found the rover’s position was off by 1 millimeter. They discovered damage to about 25 bits — a minuscule fraction of the processor’s 1 gigabyte of memory — and developed a solution to isolate those bits while the algorithm runs.\n\nAlongside the broader Mars Global Localization process, the team’s sanity check and memory solutions are expected to find new uses as faster commercial processors are employed in future missions. In the meantime, the team has already turned their sights to the Moon, where difficult lighting conditions and long, cold lunar nights make knowing exactly where spacecraft are located all the more critical.\n\nNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, as part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program portfolio.\n\nTo learn more about Perseverance:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance\n\nMelissa Pamer / DC Agle \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n626-314-4928 / 818-393-9011\nmelissa.pamer@jpl.nasa.gov / agle@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov",

    "description": "NASA says it's rolling the SLS rocket off the launch pad so it can get to the bottom of a helium flow issue it ran into over the weekend.",
    "fullText": "It looks like a March launch is no longer in the cards for Artemis II, NASA's first crewed trip to the moon's vicinity since the final Apollo mission over 50 years ago. While preparations were underway at the Kennedy Space Center for a launch as soon as March 6, the space agency says it ran into an issue with the flow of helium to its SLS rocket's upper stage this weekend and it now has to roll the rocket from the launch pad back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to figure out what's wrong and fix it. A media briefing is planned for sometime this week to discuss the problem and what's next.\n\nBut in a post on X, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman confirmed the rollback will \"take the March launch window out of consideration.\" NASA noted on its blog that the current effort \"potentially preserves the April launch window, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.\" It's a four-mile trip back to the VAB that will take hours to carefully transport the massive rocket and the Orion spacecraft. NASA says it's eyeing February 24 for this trek.\n\nThe issue occurred overnight in the early hours of February 21, when NASA says it observed \"interrupted flow of helium to the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage.\" The space agency explained:\n\nThe upper stage uses helium to maintain the proper environmental conditions for the stage’s engine and to pressurize liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant tanks. The systems worked during NASA’s Artemis II wet dress rehearsals, but teams were not able to properly flow helium during normal operations and reconfigurations following the wet dress rehearsal that concluded Feb. 19. Operators are using a backup method to maintain the environmental conditions for the upper stage engines and the rocket, which remains in a safe configuration.\n\nThe Artemis II crew — Commander Reid Wiseman, Pilot Victor Glover, Mission Specialist Christina Koch and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen, Mission Specialist — had just entered quarantine a day before the issue arose. NASA says the astronauts have since come out of quarantine.\n\nAt the start of this year, NASA announced an accelerated timeline for Artemis II, which was previously set for April 2026 after experiencing delays in 2024. For this 10-day mission, which will be the first crewed flight of the SLS rocket, the Artemis II astronauts will take a trip around the moon in the Orion spacecraft. While it initially targeted early February, the launch was pushed to March due to issues that popped up during the wet dress rehearsal. Now, we're back to the beginning with a possible April launch, but that’ll depend on the fix being a quick one.",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Grounded until at least April, NASA’s giant moon rocket is headed back to the hangar this week for more repairs before astronauts climb aboard.\n\nThe space agency said Sunday it’s targeting Tuesday for the slow, four-mile (6.4-kilometer) trek across Kennedy Space Center, weather permitting.\n\nNASA had barely finished a repeat fueling test Thursday, to ensure dangerous hydrogen fuel leaks were plugged, when another problem cropped up.\n\nThis time, the rocket’s helium system malfunctioned, further delaying astronauts’ first trip to the moon in more than half a century.\n\nEngineers had just tamed the hydrogen leaks and settled on a March 6 launch date — already a month late — when the helium issue arose. The helium flow to the rocket's upper stage was disrupted; helium is needed to purge the engines and pressurize the fuel tanks.\n\n“Returning to the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy is required to determine the cause of the issue and fix it,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nNASA said the quick rollback preps preserve an April launch attempt, but stressed that will depend on how the repairs go. The space agency has only a handful of days any given month to launch the crew of four around the moon and back.\n\nThe three Americans and one Canadian assigned to the Artemis II mission remain on standby in Houston. They will become the first people to fly to the moon since NASA's Apollo program that sent 24 astronauts there from 1968 through 1972.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "description": "Jared Isaacman critiqued engineering issues, but said leadership and decision-making was the \"most troubling failure\" of the Boeing Starliner debacle.",
    "fullText": "The head of NASA sent a scathing letter to employees on Thursday, outlining the failures of the botched Boeing Starliner mission that left a pair of astronauts stuck in space.\n\nJared Isaacman slammed \"design and engineering deficiencies\" but said the \"most troubling failure\" was decision-making and leadership.\n\n\"If left unchecked, [it] could create a culture incompatible with human spaceflight,\" he added.\n\nThe mission took place in June 2024, flying two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. However, helium leaks saw Starliner's thrusters malfunction. The mission was supposed to last eight days, but the pair ultimately spent over 90 days in space before returning to Earth on a SpaceX flight.\n\n\"We returned the crew safely, but the path we took did not reflect NASA at its best,\" Isaacman told staff.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the incident was formally designated as a \"Type A mishap\" — the most severe level, on par with the Columbia and Challenger Space Shuttle disasters.\n\nNASA defines such mishaps as those causing more than $2 million in failure costs, the loss of a vehicle or its control, or deaths.\n\nHowever, a mishap was not initially declared for Starliner, despite a loss of control and, according to Isaacman, \"cost thresholds exceeding a Type A mishap by a factor of one hundred,\" implying a loss of at least $200 million.\n\nThis decision was influenced by \"concern for the Starliner program's reputation,\" he added.\n\nIsaacman's letter wasn't entirely gloomy.\n\nHe praised the \"extraordinary professionalism\" of controllers and crew who recovered control of the spacecraft and achieved docking with the International Space Station.\n\n\"At that moment, had different decisions been made, had thrusters not been recovered, or had docking been unsuccessful, the outcome of this mission could have been very different,\" he added.\n\nThe letter coincided with the publication of the report into the Starliner mission. It's over 300 pages long and details the engineering and cultural problems.\n\nInvestigators said there were \"times of unprofessional behavior\" as NASA and Boeing butted heads on how to bring the astronauts home.\n\n\"There was yelling in meetings,\" one interviewee said. \"It was emotionally charged and unproductive.\" Another said they heard safety engineers being berated \"off muted mics.\"\n\n\"It was probably the ugliest environment that I've been in,\" said another.\n\nThe report listed three root causes for the debacle.\n\nFirstly, it said NASA had a \"hands-off approach\" to setting up the contract, leading to insufficient oversight of Boeing's design and testing.\n\nThen, Boeing didn't verify the propulsion system across all environments and use cases during the design phase, leaving Starliner exposed to conditions for which it wasn't properly certified, the report said.\n\nLastly, it said the culture at NASA's Commercial Crew Program led to greater acceptance of technical risk and a reluctance to fully challenge Boeing's analyses.\n\nIsaacman said that NASA will continue working with Boeing.\n\n\"But to be clear: NASA will not fly another crew on Starliner until technical causes are understood and corrected, the propulsion system is fully qualified, and appropriate investigation recommendations are implemented,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said it was \"grateful\" to NASA for its \"thorough investigation.\"\n\n\"In the 18 months since our test flight, Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team that directly align with the findings in the report.\"",

    "fullText": "NASA’s new boss blasted Boeing and the space agency Thursday for Starliner’s botched flight that left two astronauts stuck for months at the International Space Station.\n\nAdministrator Jared Isaacman said poor leadership and decision-making at Boeing led to Starliner’s troubles. He also blamed NASA managers for failing to intervene and get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back more quickly.\n\nThe two test pilots, now retired from NASA, spent more than nine months at the station before catching a lift back with SpaceX last March.\n\nIsaacman said Starliner’s problems must be better understood and fixed before any more astronauts strap in.\n\nIn a sweeping and emphatic move, Isaacman upgraded the seriousness of Starliner's troubled astronaut debut, declaring it a “Type A mishap,” something that could endanger a crew. Both the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters also involved cultural and leadership missteps. It is a mistake that Starliner was not designated a serious mishap right from the start, Isaacman said, citing internal pressure to keep Boeing on board and flights on track.\n\n“This is just about doing the right thing,” he said. “This is about getting the record straight.”\n\nThruster failures and other problems almost prevented Wilmore and Williams from reaching the space station following liftoff in 2024. The thruster analyses continue by Boeing.\n\n“We almost did have a really terrible day,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, referring to a potential loss of life.\n\nNASA issued its 312-page Starliner report while conducting a second fueling test of its moon rocket at Kennedy Space Center. Hydrogen fuel leaks spoiled the first dress rehearsal earlier this month and stalled astronauts' first flight to the moon since 1972.\n\nBoeing said the findings will help the company move forward in ensuring crew safety, and stressed that the Starliner program would continue. Time is running out as NASA proceeds toward decommissioning the space station in 2030, although Isaacman, a self-financed space traveler, foresees “endless demand” for multiple pathways to orbit once private outposts are booming.\n\nThere is no timeline for when Boeing can launch Starliner on a supply run, essentially another test flight to prove its safety before astronaut flights. The grounding leaves SpaceX as the only U.S. taxi service for astronauts.\n\n“Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team,” Boeing said in a statement.\n\nEven before the troubled astronaut flight, Boeing was struggling with Starliner issues. The first test flight in 2019, without anyone on board, ended up in the wrong orbit and forced a repeat mission, which had its own difficulties.\n\nNASA hired Boeing and SpaceX in 2014, in the wake of the space shuttles’ retirement, to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Their contracts are worth billions. SpaceX just delivered its 13th crew to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nKshatriya said the space agency must do better moving forward.\n\n“We have to own our part of this,” he said. As for Wilmore and Williams, “We failed them.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "In the 2000 film \"Thirteen Days\" dramatizing the Cuban Missile Crisis, the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. reprised the role of a lifetime.\n\nBack in 1962, the Gearing-class destroyer stopped a freighter heading toward Cuba that was suspected of carrying missile parts, sending a boarding party to inspect its cargo in a display of the US Navy's might.\n\nDuring the filming of \"Thirteen Days,\" the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. reenacted this pivotal mission, playing herself in a triumphant return to the open seas nearly 40 years later.\n\nHaving served in the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Cold War, the ship's ability to star in a movie is a testament to the work of museum staff and volunteers at Battleship Cove in Fall River, Massachusetts, to keep it afloat.\n\n\"There's always this constant desire to bring the ships back to their original configuration, and our volunteers are heavily involved in that,\" Christopher Nardi, Battleship Cove's chief operating officer, told Business Insider. \"We have a really good core of volunteers.\"\n\nI visited the ship — now a museum and war memorial — named for President John F. Kennedy's older brother. Take a look inside the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., whose sailors affectionately called her \"Joey P.\"\n\nCommissioned in 1945, the ship was built in just eight months as part of the Gearing-class of destroyers.\n\nAt 390 feet long, it just outstretches the length of one football field.\n\nThe crew consisted of 288 men: 18 officers and 270 enlisted. When fully loaded, it weighed 3,460 tons.\n\nThe eldest son of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and the older brother of the future President John F. Kennedy, \"Joe\" was a lieutenant in the US Navy. He and his co-pilot, Lieutenant Wilford John Willy, died during Operation Aphrodite in 1944 when the explosives aboard their plane detonated before they ejected to safety.\n\nIn attendance were Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., his wife, Rose Kennedy, and their children Patricia, Jean, Ted, and Eunice.\n\nHomeported in Newport, Rhode Island, the destroyer also traveled to Washington, DC, for Kennedy's inauguration in 1961.\n\nThe USS Joseph P. Kennedy helped recover spacecraft from the ocean during NASA's Project Mercury in 1961 and the Gemini 6 and 7 missions in 1965.\n\nThe destroyer also participated in the US naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, boarding the freighter Marcula to search it for missile components.\n\nThe USS Joseph P. Kennedy was decommissioned in 1973.\n\nLocated in Fall River, Massachusetts, Battleship Cove is also home to the battleship USS Massachusetts and the submarine USS Lionfish.\n\nI visited the museum in January and paid $25 for a general-admission adult ticket.\n\nThe 5-inch guns could fire projectiles weighing 55 pounds up to 10 miles.\n\nDASHes, smaller than regular helicopters, were deployed to drop torpedoes on unsuspecting enemy submarines.\n\nThe hangar and flight deck were added to the ship as part of the Navy's Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program in 1961.\n\nThis device was known as a \"pepperbox\" or \"matchbox\" launcher for its boxy shape. It could fire torpedoes over 5 miles away.\n\nSome parts of the deck were blocked off for preservation work as museum volunteers restored the ship.\n\nThe bridge featured navigation, steering, and communication equipment. It was situated high up with numerous windows for maximum visibility.\n\nThe wardroom featured a portrait of the ship's namesake, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.\n\nOfficers ate the same meals as the rest of the crew, but in a more elevated atmosphere.\n\nMenus included seasonal meals, such as turkey for Thanksgiving dinner, to boost crew morale.\n\nI was surprised by how narrow the hallways were, reminiscent of a submarine.\n\nCrew members who worked in this office were known as Yeomen and Personnelmen.\n\nCrew members in the supply department oversaw supplies of tactical items, such as ammunition, and other necessities, such as food.\n\nThe sick bay was also equipped for minor surgeries, complete with a folding operating table.\n\nThe oil king was the ship's fuel expert responsible for keeping the fuel tanks full and monitoring the quality of the boiler feedwater.\n\nWhen crew members were at their battle stations, the engineering department transformed into damage control central to coordinate repairs to the ship.\n\nIf the sick bay was unavailable or compromised, the barbershop could also function as a space to treat injuries sustained in combat.\n\nETs worked with everything from crucial radio and weapons systems to power tools from the ship's machine shop.\n\nThe ship store on board the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. displayed shaving cream and razors, as well as recognizable brands of snacks such as Sun-Maid raisins, Planters mixed nuts, and Ritz crackers.\n\nWith a crew of 288 men packed into a 390-foot-long ship, personal space was hard to come by.\n\nThe machine shop also occasionally assisted with servicing other ships.\n\nFresh water had many uses on the ship. The first priority was filling the boilers that kept the ship's steam-powered system running. Drinking, bathing, and cooking were secondary priorities.\n\nThe degaussing switchboard sent direct-current voltage to coils throughout the ship to reduce its magnetic signature, preventing it from setting off magnetic naval mines.\n\nAn unoccupied chair of honor, dedicated to prisoners of war and those missing in action, symbolizes that \"there will always be a place awaiting their return,\" the accompanying plaque reads.\n\nThe USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., like many retired warships, was at risk of being disassembled for spare parts until it was acquired by a museum dedicated to its preservation and restoration.\n\n\"Especially in the case of the Kennedy, she sat in Newport for a few years, and so other active ships' crews would come on board and take what they needed for their ships if it was the appropriate equipment,\" Nardi said. \"So we're very lucky compared to some other ships and stuff they lost.\"\n\nModern guided-missile destroyers, such as Arleigh Burke- and Zumwalt-class destroyers, are equipped to both launch and intercept missiles. They have recently been deployed to the Middle East in June 2025 to counter Iranian ballistic missile attacks aimed at Israel and to the Caribbean in September 2025 to combat drug cartels.",

    "description": "Yet another tantalizing clue.",
    "fullText": "Last year, NASA’s Curiosity rover made a fascinating discovery after boring into a suspected ancient lake bed on Mars: long-chain organic molecules, called alkanes, that could serve as a potential chemical relic of ancient life on the Red Planet.\n\nThe molecules, researchers suggested at the time, could have derived from fatty acids, which are common building blocks of cell membranes on Earth, once again strengthening the case that Mars could’ve been teeming with life billions of years ago.\n\nIt was just another tantalizing clue in our search for extraterrestrial life, not the smoking gun we’ve all been waiting for.\n\nNonetheless, scientists continue to be fascinated by the finding. In a paper published in the journal Astrobiology last week, a team led by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Alexander Pavlov argues that the presence of these molecules — despite the millions of years of destructive radiation that pummeled the Martian surface after it lost much of its atmosphere — “cannot be readily explained” by non-biological processes alone.\n\nOne theory is that carbon-rich dust particles and meteorites could have deposited these long-chain organic molecules on the surface, with the ancient Martian atmosphere allowing the organics to accumulate billions of years ago.\n\nHowever, Pavlov and his colleagues aren’t convinced. After studying how 80 million years’ worth of pelting radiation could have affected these molecules, they concluded that prior to the loss of the planet’s atmosphere, the concentration of these alkanes was likely much higher than previously thought. To help explain their findings, they took into account other non-biological processes in an attempt to arrive at their inferred original abundance — but couldn’t, even after combining all of them.\n\nIn other words, biological processes like the ones observed on Earth are still a leading theory, even after researchers’ best efforts to find a non-life explanation.\n\n“We argue that such high concentrations of long-chain alkanes are inconsistent with a few known abiotic sources of organic molecules on ancient Mars,” they wrote.\n\nNonetheless, they stopped well short of making any definitive statements about life on the Red Planet. After all, there could be still-unknown, non-biological processes we don’t know about that could have resulted in the observed concentration of long-chain carbon molecules on Mars.\n\n“We agree with Carl Sagan’s claim that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and understand that any purported detection of life on Mars will necessarily be met with intense scrutiny,” they concluded in their paper. “In addition, in practice with established norms in the field of astrobiology, we note that the certainty of a life detection beyond Earth will require multiple lines of evidence.”\n\nNonetheless, it’s a tantalizing waypoint in our longstanding efforts to determine whether Mars, a planet that was once covered in huge oceans, rivers, and lakes, could have supported life.\n\nPavlov and his colleagues are now calling for further research into how radiation degraded these intriguing molecules under Mars-like conditions to shed more light on the matter.\n\nMore on Mars: Scientists Find Evidence of Ancient Tropical Oasis on Mars",

    "title": "NASA's Artemis II Spacesuits Still Have One Big Problem, According To Former Astronauts",
    "description": "As NASA prepares to kick off the Artemis missions, experts have noticed a potentially dangerous issue with a crucial component: the newly designed spacesuits.",
    "fullText": "You would think that NASA has everything ironed out for its biggest mission series yet: the Artemis missions, which will eventually send a crew of astronauts to the lunar surface. But as Artemis II gears up to launch and the rocket is prepared for takeoff, NASA is still adapting, though not necessarily for the better.\n\nFor example, the Artemis II Orion craft had a potentially dangerous flaw that saw NASA adjusting its reentry trajectory to address it. That flaw was originally discovered during the Artemis I mission, when the craft's heat shield saw char loss. Meanwhile, the new spacesuits pose another big problem: They will reportedly be heavier and bulkier than those worn during the Apollo missions (dubbed the Armstrong spacesuit). After over half a century, the astronauts will be wearing suits that have taken a step backwards in the heft department. It may not seem concerning since they'll be bouncing around in zero gravity, but former astronauts put that idea to bed. Being on the moon will actually create \"extreme physical stress\" on the astronauts for several reasons.\n\nKate Rubins, former astronaut and professor of computational and systems biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, explains that during a moonwalk, physical stress is elevated. For starters, \"people are going to be sleep shifting,\" which means they'll barely rest. Moreover, the astronauts will be wearing the suits for up to nine hours and doing EVAs (extravehicular activities or spacewalks) every day. According to Rubins, the spacewalks she did outside the ISS were like doing multiple marathons in succession.\n\nAs Rubin explains, the Axiom commercial suits (aka the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or AxEMU) will create added physical exertion and stress during the moonwalks. Not exclusively from the suits, but also equipment astronauts will be wearing and carrying, like a heavy life support backpack. The suits weigh over 300 pounds in Earth's gravity, though due to the lower gravity — about 1/6 of Earth's — they're lighter on the lunar surface. They'll still be heavier than the original 185-pound Armstrong suits. Each astronaut will also have to contend with the weight of the suit, the equipment, and their body mass collectively. Artemis III will not have a rover, either, so astronauts will be taking all physical exertion upon themselves to move equipment, tools, and other gear.\n\nThe AxEMU suits do a lot of things right, per official descriptions. They're safer and built to last generations, and they offer a custom fit for everyone. NASA and the Artemis astronauts promote the increase in mobility the Axiom suits offer. With a lot of those improvements thanks to the rear-entry design. Astronauts can get in and out themselves without help. Moreover, the suit is engineered for planetary or surface walks, which means support for legs, more upper mobility, and modular support to bring various tools.\n\nEven so, the weight may pose a challenge bigger than anyone is expecting. Former astronaut Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt, from the Apollo 17 mission, once remarked he would have designed suits to have \"four times the mobility, and half the weight.\" The AxEMU may have more mobility, but it's also heavier. We'll know soon enough how it works out, as NASA is already building the Artemis 3 rocket, which will fly after Artemis II's loop around the moon.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "In a new study, researchers say that non-biological sources they considered could not fully account for the abundance of organic compounds in a sample collected on Mars by NASA’s Curiosity rover.\n\nIn March 2025, scientists reported identifying small amounts of decane, undecane, and dodecane in a rock sample analyzed in the chemistry lab aboard Curiosity. These were the largest organic compounds found on Mars, with researchers hypothesizing that they could be fragments of fatty acids preserved in the ancient mudstone in Gale Crater. On Earth, fatty acids are produced mostly by life, though they can be made through geologic processes, too.\n\nIt was not possible to determine from Curiosity’s data alone whether or not the molecules they found were made by living things, which led to a follow-on study that evaluated known non-biological sources of these organic molecules — such as delivery by meteorites smashing into the Martian surface — to see if they could account for the amounts previously found.\n\nReporting on Feb. 4 in the journal Astrobiology, researchers say that as the non-biological sources they considered could not fully explain the abundance of organic compounds, it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that living things could have formed them.\n\nTo reach their conclusion, scientists combined lab radiation experiments, mathematical modeling, and Curiosity data to “rewind the clock” about 80 million years — the length of time the rock would have been exposed on the Martian surface. This allowed them to estimate how much organic material would have been present before being destroyed by long-term exposure to cosmic radiation: far more than typical non-biological processes could produce.\n\nThe team says more study is needed to better understand how quickly organic molecules break down in Mars-like rock under Mars-like conditions — and before any conclusions can be reached about the absence or presence of life.\n\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.",

    "description": "NASA spent most of Monday trying to overcome hydrogen leaks on the Artemis II rocket.",
    "fullText": "The launch of NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first flight of astronauts to the Moon in more than 53 years, will have to wait another month after a fueling test Monday uncovered hydrogen leaks in the connection between the rocket and its launch platform at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\n“Engineers pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” NASA said in a statement following the conclusion of the mock countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), early Tuesday morning. “To allow teams to review data and conduct a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, NASA now will target March as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test.”\n\nThe practice countdown was designed to identify problems and provide NASA an opportunity to fix them before launch. Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak.\n\nNow, the second Space Launch System (SLS) rocket is on the cusp of launching a crew for the first time. The Artemis II mission will send four astronauts inside NASA’s Orion spacecraft on a loop around the far side of the Moon on the first crewed lunar flight since 1972, paving the way for future expeditions to land humans at the Moon’s south pole.\n\nGoing into the countdown rehearsal, NASA officials hoped a smooth test would clear the way to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as Sunday, February 8. NASA has only a handful of launch opportunities for Artemis II each month, when the Moon is in the right location in its orbit to allow the Orion spacecraft to fly a so-called free return trajectory and come back to Earth for a safe reentry and splashdown.\n\nThe first launch opportunity for Artemis II next month is March 6, with a two-hour launch window opening at 8:29 pm EST (01:26 UTC on March 7).\n\nArtemis II commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen have been in medical quarantine since January 21, a standard practice for astronauts preparing to fly to space. They will now be released from quarantine at their home base in Houston to resume training and await a new launch date.\n\nNASA’s Artemis launch team, stationed a few miles away from the SLS rocket on its seaside launch pad, started fueling operations around midday Monday, somewhat later than scheduled due to cold temperatures at the Florida spaceport. The launch team first detected leaking hydrogen soon after they began loading the super-cold fuel into the SLS core stage.\n\nThe leak appeared in the same location it did during the Artemis I launch campaign nearly three years ago. Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen flow from ground storage tanks into the SLS core stage through so-called Tail Service Mast Umbilicals (TSMUs), two roughly 30-foot-tall gray pods rising from the base of the rocket’s mobile launch platform. The TSMUs route propellant lines through connections near the bottom of the core stage, where umbilical plates on the rocket side and ground side meet. At liftoff, the umbilical plates disconnect as the rocket begins its climb off the launch pad.\n\nHydrogen is one of the most efficient rocket fuels, but it is notoriously difficult to handle. Liquified hydrogen must be stored at minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 253 degrees Celsius), cold enough to change the shape and size of seals and other soft goods in the fueling line. This can create leak paths not readily detectable at ambient temperatures. Hydrogen molecules are the smallest and lightest in the Universe, with the ability to find their way through the tiniest of breaches.\n\nBecause of this, NASA engineers accept that a small amount of hydrogen will escape seals in the fueling line. Agency officials said in 2022 that the safe limit was a 4 percent concentration of hydrogen gas in the housing around the fueling connector. Hydrogen levels exceeded NASA’s safety limit multiple times during the practice countdown that ran from Monday into early Tuesday.\n\n“ Attempts to resolve the issue involved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up for the seals to reseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant,” NASA said in a statement.\n\nNASA appeared to get past the problem Monday evening and fully loaded the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of propellant.\n\nWith fueling complete, managers sent a closeout crew to the launch pad around 6:00 pm EST (23:00 UTC) to close the hatch to the Orion spacecraft sitting atop the SLS rocket. The closeout team will help the Artemis II astronauts into the Orion capsule on launch day, but the crew was not part of the practice countdown Monday night.\n\nThe closeout crew took longer than anticipated to close and secure the hatch to the Orion spacecraft. A valve associated with Orion’s hatch pressurization inadvertently vented, according to NASA, requiring the closeout crew to retorque the valve. The launch team dealt with several other glitches, including audio dropouts on ground communication loops and camera problems believed to be caused by recent cold weather in Central Florida.\n\nFinally, with the closeout crew a safe distance away from the rocket, the launch team gave approval to begin the final 10 minutes of the countdown shortly after midnight Tuesday. The objective was to stop the countdown clock 33 seconds prior to launch, about the same time the rocket would take control of the countdown during a real launch attempt.\n\nInstead, the clock stopped at T-minus 5 minutes and 15 seconds. NASA said the countdown terminated “due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.” The countdown ended before the rocket switched to internal power and fully pressurized its four propellant tanks. The test also concluded before the rocket activated its auxiliary power units to run the core stage’s four main engines through a preflight steering check, all milestones engineers hoped to cross off their checklist.\n\nLaunch controllers began work to drain the SLS rocket’s propellant tanks after calling an end to the countdown. With the test incomplete, NASA managers quickly decided to hold off on launching the Artemis II mission to allow time for ground teams to “fully review data from the test, mitigate each issue, and return to testing ahead of setting an official target launch date.”\n\n“As always, safety remains our top priority, for our astronauts, our workforce, our systems, and the public,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a social media post. “We will only launch when we believe we are as ready to undertake this historic mission.”\n\nOfficials did not immediately announce when they might be ready for a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, or whether they plan to roll the rocket back to its assembly building for repairs. NASA managers plan to hold a press briefing Tuesday afternoon to discuss the results of the test in more detail.",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA ran into exasperating fuel leaks during a make-or-break test of its new moon rocket Monday, calling into question how soon astronauts could take off for a trip around the moon.\n\nThe leaks — reminiscent of the rocket's delayed debut three years ago — sprang just a couple hours into the daylong fueling operation at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nLaunch controllers began loading the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket with super-cold hydrogen and oxygen at midday. More than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million liters) had to flow into the tanks and remain on board for several hours, mimicking the final stages of an actual countdown.\n\nBut excessive hydrogen quickly built up near the bottom of the rocket. Hydrogen loading was halted at least twice as the launch team scrambled to work around the problem using techniques developed during the previous Space Launch System countdown in 2022. That first test flight was plagued by hydrogen leaks before finally soaring without a crew.\n\nThe four astronauts assigned to the mission — three Americans and one Canadian — monitored the critical dress rehearsal from nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away in Houston, home to Johnson Space Center. They have been in quarantine for the past 1½ weeks, awaiting the practice countdown's outcome.\n\nMonday's fueling demo will determine when they can blast off on the first lunar voyage by a crew in more than half a century.\n\nAt best, NASA could launch commander Reid Wiseman and his crew to the moon no sooner than Sunday. The rocket must be flying by Feb. 11 or the mission will be called off until March. The space agency only has a few days in any given month to launch the rocket, and the extreme cold already has shortened February’s launch window by two days.\n\nRunning behind because of the bitter cold snap, the countdown clocks began ticking Saturday night, giving launch controllers the chance to go through all the motions and deal with any lingering rocket problems. The clocks were set to stop a half-minute before reaching zero, just before engine ignition.\n\nThe nearly 10-day mission will send the astronauts past the moon, around the mysterious far side and then straight back to Earth, with the goal of testing the capsule's life support and other vital systems. The crew will not go into lunar orbit or attempt to land.\n\nNASA last sent astronauts to the moon during the 1960s and 1970s Apollo program. The new Artemis program aims for a more sustained lunar presence, with Wiseman’s crew setting the stage for future moon landings by other astronauts.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "description": "As the four-person crew of Artemis II prepares to launch on a historic mission around the moon as soon as February, some experts are worried about the Orion spacecraft’s heat shield.",
    "fullText": "When four astronauts begin a historic trip around the moon as soon as February 6, they’ll climb aboard NASA’s 16.5-foot-wide Orion spacecraft with the understanding that it has a known flaw — one that has some experts urging the space agency not to fly the mission with humans on board. But NASA remains confident it has a handle on the problem and the vehicle can bring the crew home safely.\n\nThe issue relates to a special coating applied to the bottom part of the spacecraft, called the heat shield. It’s a crucial piece of hardware designed to protect the astronauts from extreme temperatures as they’re descending back to Earth during the final stretch of their moon-bound mission called Artemis II.\n\nThis vital part of the Orion spacecraft is nearly identical to the heat shield flown on Artemis I, an uncrewed 2022 test flight. That prior mission’s Orion vehicle returned from space with a heat shield pockmarked by unexpected damage — prompting NASA to investigate the issue.\n\nAnd while NASA is poised to clear the heat shield for flight, even those who believe the mission is safe acknowledge there is unknown risk involved.\n\n“This is a deviant heat shield,” said Dr. Danny Olivas, a former NASA astronaut who served on a space agency-appointed independent review team that investigated the incident. “There’s no doubt about it: This is not the heat shield that NASA would want to give its astronauts.”\n\nStill, Olivas said he believes after spending years analyzing what went wrong with the heat shield, NASA “has its arms around the problem.”\n\nUpon completing the investigation about a year ago, NASA determined it would fly the Artemis II Orion capsule as is, believing it could ensure the crew’s safety by slightly altering the mission’s flight path.\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Friday, NASA said the agency “considered all aspects” when making that decision, noting there is also “uncertainty that comes with the development and qualification of the processes of changing the manufacturing process of the Avcoat ablator blocks.”\n\nBasically, NASA said, there’s uncertainty involved no matter which course of action it takes.\n\n“I think in my mind, there’s no flight that ever takes off where you don’t have a lingering doubt,” Olivas said. “But NASA really does understand what they have. They know the importance of the heat shield to crew safety, and I do believe that they’ve done the job.”\n\nLakiesha Hawkins, the acting deputy associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, echoed that sentiment in September, saying, “from a risk perspective, we feel very confident.”\n\nAnd Reid Wiseman, the astronaut set to command the Artemis II mission, has expressed his confidence.\n\n“The investigators discovered the root cause, which was the key” to understanding and solving the heat shield issue, Wiseman told reporters last July. “If we stick to the new reentry path that NASA has planned, then this heat shield will be safe to fly.”\n\n“What they’re talking about doing is crazy,” said Dr. Charlie Camarda, a heat shield expert, research scientist and former NASA astronaut.\n\nCamarda — who was also a member of the first space shuttle crew to launch after the 2003 Columbia disaster — is among a group of former NASA employees who do not believe that the space agency should put astronauts on board the upcoming lunar excursion. He said he has spent months trying to get agency leadership to heed his warnings to no avail.\n\n“We could have solved this problem way back when,” Camarda, who worked as a NASA research scientist for two decades before becoming an astronaut, said of the heat shield issue. “Instead, they keep kicking the can down the road.”\n\nNow, the agency appears on track to green-light Artemis II for takeoff, as its leaders have sought to assure the public — and the crew — the mission will be safe.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft was rolled to its launchpad atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on January 17. And a crucial milestone could be days away as Artemis program leaders gather for final risk assessments and the flight readiness review, a meeting in which top brass will determine whether the Artemis II rocket and spacecraft are ready to take off with NASA’s Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and the Canadian Space Agency’s Jeremy Hansen, on board.\n\nEven before Artemis, the Orion capsule — a $20.4 billion spacecraft that NASA spent 20 years developing — was not exactly a darling of the aerospace community. Resentment for the vehicle has been brewing in various pockets of the industry for some time.\n\nOne engineer and physicist who previously worked on advanced technology development but did not work directly on the Artemis program derided Orion as “flaming garbage.” A former employee at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he decried the capsule’s exceptionally long development timeline and cost overruns that have ballooned into the billions of dollars.\n\nLori Garver, a former deputy administrator for NASA under the Obama administration, has publicly lamented the politicking that colored the vehicle’s path to completion.\n\nBut Orion’s issues can’t be fully pinned on politics, said Dr. Ed Pope, a heat shield and material science expert who founded Matech, a California-based missile defense technology company. Pope did not participate in NASA’s heat shield investigation.\n\n“It’s not a Republican thing or a Democrat thing at all,” Pope told CNN. “It’s a bureaucrat thing.”\n\nThe decisions that led up to the heat shield issues NASA is grappling with today began early in the spacecraft’s development process, according to Pope.\n\nOrion program managers chose to make the spacecraft’s heat shield out of Avcoat material in 2009. The heat shields manufactured for NASA’s Apollo capsules all had a protective Avcoat layer, so leaders viewed it as a well-understood material with decades of data to back up its effectiveness.\n\nFor an uncrewed test flight in 2014, called EFT-1, the mission team outfitted an Orion capsule with a heat shield applied in the same manner as in the Apollo era — in an intricate honeycomb-like structure.\n\nBut that approach required a tedious manufacturing process that NASA hoped to avoid.\n\n“It was very finicky, and it was going to be really, really hard to reproduce that quickly,” said Pam Melroy, a longtime NASA employee, former astronaut and Air Force officer who once served as deputy administrator of the space agency. “That was part of the reason why we said, ‘Let’s just make this a simpler design.’ It was really all about producibility.”\n\nEven before the EFT-1 test flight launched, NASA program managers wanted to alter the design, according to Melroy. Though NASA said in a statement the final decision was made in 2015.\n\nNASA also said the honeycomb-structured Avcoat experienced issues during manufacturing for EFT-1, noting “cracks in seams appeared between the different honeycomb sections” and the material did not cure evenly and was weaker than expected. That made it “marginally acceptable” for the 2014 test flight and likely unusable for a lunar mission that requires far faster speeds and a more violent reentry process.\n\nTextron Systems, the Texas-based company that produces Avcoat, told CNN in a statement that in 2015 it “licensed the Avcoat material to Lockheed Martin, who is contracted by NASA to manufacture the heat shields for the Artemis program” and deferred further comment to the aerospace giant.\n\nBlaine Brown, director of Orion Spacecraft Mechanical Systems at Lockheed Martin Space, confirmed in a statement to CNN that the Avcoat structure was altered “to increase manufacturing and installation efficiency.”\n\n“We support NASA’s decision to fly the Artemis II mission with its current heat shield and are committed to seeing Orion safely launch and return on its historic mission to the Moon with crew onboard,” Brown said.\n\nThe Orion capsules built for the Artemis missions abandoned the Avcoat honeycomb structure in favor of a heat shield constructed using large blocks of the material.\n\n“Our experience with a block design on Mars heat shields showed us that blocks were easier to produce, test and install,” Brown said.\n\nThe first real-world test of the new Orion heat shield design, however, came with the Artemis I test flight in 2022. After that mission, NASA found chunks of the heat shield had broken off, leaving divots in the charred Avcoat material.\n\nThat is not how the heat shield is supposed to behave. The Avcoat layer is meant to erode in a controlled manner as it heats.\n\nNASA disclosed the problem months after Orion returned from space in 2022. The agency’s office of the inspector general then released images of the ravaged Artemis I heat shield in a 2024 report.\n\nFurther complicating the situation was the fact that by that point it was already too late to fix the heat shield for Artemis II.\n\nNASA did not — and could not — replace the Artemis II heat shield with a new one. The Orion capsule slated for the mission already had its heat shield installed even before Artemis I flew, and “you couldn’t just go to Billy Bob’s heat shield removal shop” to replace it, Olivas noted.\n\nThe investigation into the Artemis I heat shield issue also concluded that even though there were no astronauts on board the test flight, “flight data showed that had crew been aboard, they would have been safe.”\n\nWhen asked about NASA’s decision to move forward with the Artemis II mission without replacing the heat shield, Melroy, who oversaw the heat shield investigation as deputy administrator, said that NASA “program managers sometimes have to make these trades for cost, schedule and performance, and they certainly didn’t undertake that decision lightly.”\n\nHeat shields produced for future Artemis missions will be manufactured with upgraded techniques, NASA leaders revealed in a December 2024 news conference.\n\nSpecifically, the agency plans to alter the “billet mold loading” essentially altering how much Avcoat is loaded into a mold to ultimately produce a more permeable shield, NASA said in its Friday statement to CNN.\n\nIn the meantime, analysis of what went wrong during the 2022 test flight is informing a new approach for this year’s upcoming mission.\n\nAvcoat is ablative, meaning the material is designed to char and erode in a controlled manner as the spacecraft comes roaring back from the moon and dips back into the thick inner band of Earth’s atmosphere while still traveling more than 30 times the speed of sound.\n\nThis phase of flight, called “reentry,” causes a violent compression of air molecules that can heat the spacecraft’s exterior to more than 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius).\n\nNASA engineers designed the Orion spacecraft for a “skip reentry” — the capsule acts like a flat stone skipping atop the surface of a still lake as it dips briefly into the atmosphere and briefly raises its altitude once more before final descent. The special trajectory allows Orion to target a precise splashdown location.\n\nIn 2024, NASA twice opted to delay the timeline for the Artemis II launch in part to allow more time to collect data.\n\nThe problem, NASA concluded after months of research, was that the Avcoat material used in the Artemis I heat shield was not permeable enough. That meant that when the Orion capsule dipped into the atmosphere, gases built up in the heat shield’s interior, causing chunks of the material to break off and cracks to form.\n\nNone of the experts interviewed by CNN dispute this characterization of why the Artemis I heat shield did not perform as expected.\n\nUp for debate is how well NASA’s Artemis mission managers understand the problem and exactly how much risk the suboptimal heat shield poses to the four astronauts slated to launch in a few weeks.\n\nIn September, some of the space agency’s Artemis program leaders said they believed Orion’s heat shield would perform well on Artemis II, despite there being no substantial changes to its design.\n\nIn fact, while NASA now plans to manufacture future heat shields to be permeable, Artemis II’s heat shield is actually less permeable than the one built for Artemis I.\n\nAbout 6% of the Artemis I heat shield’s surface area was permeable, Olivas noted, and that permeable area did not suffer any cracking. But the Artemis II heat shield, he added, does not have any permeable areas, noting that change was made prior to the Artemis I test flight and before NASA realized the heat shield needed to be permeable to perform well.\n\nRick Henfling, the Artemis flight director leading reentry, said during a September news conference that the Artemis II reentry trajectory has been modified with the goal of avoiding the conditions that caused the Artemis I heat shield to crack.\n\n“We won’t go as high on that skip, it’ll just be a loft,” Henfling said.\n\nThis new reentry path, Henfling said, should allow the Avcoat material to erode normally.\n\n“We want to emphasize that safety is our top priority,” Hawkins added, repeating a long-held NASA mantra.\n\nThe decision to use an altered trajectory was made after extensive testing, NASA said in its Friday statement. And the adjusted return path is designed to create “a steeper descent angle to reduce exposure time at peak heating, thus minimizing further char loss.”\n\n“This thorough testing, analysis, simulation, and expert validation collectively formed NASA’s official flight rationale providing sufficient justification to proceed without redesigning the heat shield,” the statement reads.\n\nOther experts, however, disagree that changing Orion’s flight path is enough to guarantee that the crew will make it home safely.\n\n“The reason this is such a big deal is that when the heat shield is spalling — or you have big chunks coming off — even if the vehicle isn’t destroyed, you’re right at the point of incipient failure now,” said Dr. Dan Rasky, an expert on advanced entry systems and thermal protection materials who worked at NASA for more than 30 years.\n\n“It’s like you’re at the edge of the cliff on a foggy day,” Rasky said.\n\nRasky, like Camarda, does not believe that NASA should allow astronauts to fly on board the Artemis II Orion capsule.\n\nEven some experts who believe Artemis II is safe to fly acknowledge that the Orion heat shield will likely crack and display signs of damage upon its return from Earth, even with the modified trajectory.\n\n“Will the heat shield crack? Yes, it’s going to crack,” Olivas, the astronaut who aided NASA’s heat shield investigation, said.\n\nBut Orion has some built-in “robustness,” said Dr. Steve Scotti, a distinguished research associate at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, who served as a volunteer on an advisory team that was involved in the Artemis I heat shield investigation.\n\nUnderneath the Avcoat layer, Scotti said, lies a composite structure that during testing has been able to briefly survive the extreme temperatures of reentry. And that structure could serve as a last line of defense in the unlikely case that the Avcoat material becomes so deformed it begins to expose the underside of the spacecraft, Scotti said.\n\nThe composite structure wasn’t put there as a fail-safe or backup for the heat shield — but it’s lucky it is there, Scotti said.\n\nOlivas emphasized that NASA isn’t expecting to rely on the composite structure to keep the astronauts safe. The Avcoat material should still do that, he said. But the structure does provide an extra layer of safety, Olivas noted.\n\nAnd even if the Artemis II heat shield performs worse than it did during Artemis I, Olivas and Scotti are confident the astronauts will remain safe.\n\n“I don’t have any strong fears that the crew is in danger,” Scotti told CNN, echoing Olivas’ sentiments.\n\nBut neither Scotti’s nor Olivas’ expressions of optimism come without an asterisk. Both experts acknowledge, as Camarda argues, that engineers cannot possibly predict exactly how the heat shield will behave.\n\n“There’s very little data to be able to put into an analysis” of the heat shield, Scotti told CNN. “The material itself changes every 20 seconds or so during reentry,” he said, referring to the Avcoat layer.\n\n“We still have things we don’t know,” Scotti added. “It’s not low risk, it’s a moderate risk.”\n\nScotti’s and Olivas’ votes of confidence in the Artemis II mission were hard won.\n\nOlivas, in fact, held serious doubts about NASA’s intention to fly the Artemis II mission with crew until he sat through a three-hour meeting at the space agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC, on January 8.\n\nCNN requested and was denied access to the meeting. Only two journalists were invited to attend, and the meeting was expected to be largely off the record because confidential information was being discussed.\n\nNASA’s newly installed administrator, Jared Isaacman, convened the meeting to gauge dissenting opinions, he told CNN affiliate station WESH in Orlando.\n\nThe meeting, Isaacman said, “only reaffirmed my confidence in the decisions of the bright engineers at NASA.”\n\n“We have modified our reentry profile. We have regained margin to safety, and I feel very good about that with Artemis II,” he added.\n\nBut Olivas said his hesitations were absolved by a presentation from a “Tiger Team” — a NASA term for a specialized team brought together to solve a complex problem — at Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n“The key parameter here is: When is the heat shield going to crack? And how deep into the atmosphere are you going to be if it does crack?” Olivas said.\n\n“There’s things that we can never know until it actually happens,” he added, referring to the heat shield. But the Tiger Team’s analysis gave him confidence that NASA understood the Avcoat material well enough to be certain the crew would not be in danger.\n\n“The Tiger Team did a phenomenal job,” Olivas said. “I trust those engineers emphatically, and the program managers who are driving them.”\n\nThat, however, is where Camarda — who also attended the January 8 meeting at NASA headquarters — disagrees.\n\nCamarda takes issue, for example, with a computer program that the Tiger Team used in its heat shield analysis.\n\nCalled the Crack Indication Tool, or CIT, it was meant to model how and when the Avcoat material might begin fragmenting in various conditions.\n\nWhat if Orion were to take a smaller “skip” before making its final plunge?\n\nThe CIT is meant to churn out data about how such changes might impact the heat shield — and whether those scenarios would trigger cracking.\n\nBut the data is imperfect, Camarda argues, and the tool relies on “simplifying assumptions.”\n\n“The analysis is a simplistic model to predict gas generation, material charring and qualitatively when cracks happen,” Camarda said. “But the failure mechanism is how the cracks grow, and it definitely can’t predict that. It cannot predict the stresses and strains that cause the cracks or how they can grow.”\n\nWhen asked about Camarda’s criticisms of the CIT, Olivas acknowledged that no computer modeling program is completely accurate. And the CIT cannot predict crack growth.\n\nBut among the data points that assuaged Olivas’ concerns, he said, was the fact that the Tiger Team lined up the computer program’s predictions with real-world lab tests involving Avcoat material. The CIT was also able to correctly predict and re-create the conditions that led to the cracking on Artemis I.\n\n“That gave me a confidence that the tool itself was indeed a good predictor,” Olivas said.\n\nBut, Camarda counters, it is possible to create modeling tools that take a more interdisciplinary approach.\n\n“A multi-physics analysis can do everything in one computer code,” Camarda said. “It’s predicting the aero thermodynamic heating on the outside of the vehicle, and studying how the material changes phases and starts to burn and produces gases.”\n\nThat, he said, is the type of analysis that could give program managers a more holistic understanding of the risks this heat shield poses.\n\nTo Camarda, the heat shield problem is one symptom of a widespread ailment plaguing NASA that took root in the shuttle era. His view of the agency is informed by his experience as a young astronaut preparing to fly when the Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart during reentry in 2003, killing all seven passengers.\n\nIt marked the second tragedy for the program after the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed during ascent in 1986.\n\nIn a phone interview with CNN, Camarda highlighted that in the early 1980s, NASA had estimated that the space shuttle would have a roughly 1 in 100,000 chance of experiencing a deadly malfunction.\n\nUltimately, however, the shuttle flew a total of 135 missions with two explosions, resulting in 14 total casualties. That put the vehicle’s actual odds of experiencing a catastrophic failure at 1 in 67.5.\n\nAt one point during his NASA career, Camarda was appointed head of engineering at Johnson Space Center only, he said, to be pushed out from that role after vocally expressing concerns about mission safety in the aftermath of the Columbia disaster, he wrote in “Mission Out of Control,” a memoir and technical deep dive about his years at the agency.\n\nCamarda’s former boss did not respond to an email request for comment.\n\nCamarda ultimately left NASA in 2019 after 45 years of service.\n\nIn his view, the space agency has shifted away from a research and discovery mindset that it embodied during the Apollo era — when engineers were encouraged to identify and express concerns about potential safety issues as they picked apart engineering challenges on a fundamental level.\n\nIn today’s climate, Camarda said, he worries NASA employees are encouraged to fall in line with the assessments and goals of the agency’s management and leadership.\n\nEdgar Zapata, a retired Kennedy Space Center engineer who still serves on the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) External Council, a program that aims to fund bleeding-edge technology development, said he shares Camarda’s concerns.\n\n“I think our experiences are shaded by having seen that once this body politic decides, almost by mysterious forces, that it’s going to do something — it tends to figure out a way to move forward,” Zapata said of NASA’s decision-making process and risk assessments.\n\nNASA spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment about criticisms from Camarda regarding the agency’s culture. NASA has long maintained and emphasized that it considers safety to be its top priority.\n\nCamarda also emphasized that his opposition to Artemis II isn’t driven by a belief it will end with a catastrophic failure. He thinks it’s likely the mission will return home safely.\n\nMore than anything, Camarda told CNN, he fears that a safe flight for Artemis II will serve as validation for NASA leadership that its decision-making processes are sound. And that’s bound to lull the agency into a false sense of security, Camarda warned.\n\nThe two former astronauts and heat shield experts — Olivas and Camarda — do not share the same opinion about whether NASA should launch the Artemis II mission with crew on board. But on this point, they agree: “Sometimes we get lucky. And when we get lucky, sometimes we trade that for being good — and then we convince ourselves we’re better than we really are,” Olivas told CNN.\n\n“I think it’s valid to question what’s happening at NASA,” Olivas added, “because our history is not perfect.”\n\nNASA’s Artemis program is sending humans into deep space for the first time in five decades. \n\nEditor’s note: This story has been updated with additional information.",
