    "fullText": "Cake mix sold across the United States has been recalled over a risk of severe illness or death.\n\nA recall on Dallas-based distribution company B.C. Williams Bakery Service’s bakery mixes has recently been elevated to Class I by the FDA, meaning there is a serious health risk associated with consuming the products.\n\nThe recall was originally announced in December due to an undeclared milk allergen that was not listed on the label of various cake and bread mixes sold by the company.\n\nIt is not yet known where the mixes were sold or distributed.\n\nThe products affected by the recall are the 50-pound multi-wall bags of both the Spice Cake Mix and the Swiss Chocolate Cake Mix.\n\nLot numbers associated with the affected products include:\n\nThose who have purchased the affected products are urged to avoid using the recalled mixes, especially if they have a dairy allergy.\n\nThe Independent has contacted B.C. Williams Bakery Service for comment.\n\nMilk is identified as one of the nine major food allergies in the U.S., along with soy, wheat, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and sesame, according to the FDA. Allergic reactions to these nine foods vary but can involve “hives and lip swelling to severe, life-threatening symptoms, often called anaphylaxis, that may involve fatal respiratory problems and shock.”\n\nThere have been many different food recalls in the U.S. this year due to allergy risks. Last month, thousands of units of M&M’s products were recalled across more than a dozen states because their packaging did not include proper allergen warnings.\n\nThe recall was announced by the FDA after it emerged that more than 6,000 units had been repackaged by Beacon Promotions Inc. without advisories that they may contain milk, soy and peanuts.\n\nFirst issued January 26, the recall was elevated by the FDA to a Class II, meaning consuming the product could cause “temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences.”\n\nThe M&M’s in question were distributed in packaging that was labelled for promotional purposes, according to the FDA, and could contain any of the following promotional labels or packages listed here.\n\nThey were distributed in the following 20 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nAnyone who has the products in question and is allergic to or sensitive to nuts, soy, or milk should throw them away. Those who are not allergic or sensitive can safely consume them.",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration has refused to accept an application from Moderna to review its first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine, the company said Tuesday, in another setback for the technology that’s been a target of some Trump administration health officials.\n\nThe agency told Moderna that its application didn’t contain an “adequate and well-controlled” trial because the control arm didn’t reflect the “best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study,” according to a letter dated February 3 that Moderna posted online. It didn’t identify any safety or efficacy concerns, the company said.\n\nModerna said that the refusal was inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency and that it had requested a meeting with FDA officials to understand how to proceed.\n\n“The complete stunner here is at no point in any of this did anybody say that it was not adequate” to run its clinical trial the way it had discussed with the agency, Moderna’s president, Dr. Stephen Hoge, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said “the FDA generally does not comment on regulatory communications to individual sponsors.” It’s rare for the FDA to issue a “refuse-to-file” letter; a 2021 study of almost 2,500 applications submitted to the agency found that only 4% received such letters.\n\nModerna used a standard-dose seasonal flu vaccine called Fluarix as a comparator in a 40,700-person clinical trial to demonstrate the experimental mRNA vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The company said the FDA had agreed with that plan in April 2024 but suggested it also include data comparing its vaccine with an approved high-dose flu vaccine for people over 65, which the company said it did.\n\nModerna added that as recently as August, in a meeting before it submitted its application for approval of the vaccine, the FDA suggested that it would review the filing and assess issues with the comparator during that process. The agency did note that there could be a “significant issue” with the data “during review” of the application, according to written feedback that Moderna shared.\n\nBut last week, the agency refused to do the review at all, according to the letter. It was signed by Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine regulation.\n\nPrasad was an outspoken critic of the government’s response to Covid-19 before he was appointed to the FDA under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He claimed late last year without providing details that Covid-19 vaccines resulted in deaths of 10 children and has said the agency will change its vaccine approval process.\n\nModerna is one of three manufacturers in the US of approved Covid-19 vaccines, along with Pfizer and Novavax. Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines use mRNA technology. Pfizer also has mRNA-based flu vaccines in development.\n\nAlthough the record-speed development of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic was a chief accomplishment of Trump’s first term, his second administration has withdrawn support for mRNA technology in infectious diseases. HHS canceled 22 projects worth about $500 million focused on mRNA vaccine development in August, claiming against evidence that “these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved millions of lives. The hope behind applying mRNA technology to seasonal flu vaccines is that it could improve how well they work, enable tailoring for geographic regions where different strains are circulating and lead to combinations with Covid-19 vaccines so people would need only one shot for protection against both viruses.\n\nWith currently approved technology, experts select flu strains for each fall’s seasonal vaccines during the preceding February. Hoge pointed out that mRNA vaccines can be manufactured much faster; for Covid-19 vaccines, he said, the design is decided in May or June, for shipping by August.\n\nChoosing the strains closer to the start of flu season could potentially lead to a better match with circulating viruses, “and better matching equals, usually, better protection,” Hoge said.\n\nModerna’s phase 3 study showed in results reported in June that the mRNA-based flu shot produced efficacy that was about 27% higher than Fluarix in adults 50 and older. A separate trial that assessed safety and immune response included the comparison with a high-dose flu vaccine for people 65 and older and showed superiority, Moderna said.\n\nImmune response is assessed in the laboratory by analyzing blood samples of people who’ve been vaccinated, while efficacy assessments typically involve seeing how well a vaccine protects against cases of the disease.\n\nModerna had been awaiting the start of the review of its flu shot before it moved its experimental combination flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine into the FDA review process, Hoge said. That’s now on hold as the company awaits a meeting and further guidance from the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the combination vaccine is moving forward in other countries.\n\n“We do expect that our first approval will be … probably in Europe, and this year,” Hoge said. “So that’ll be a milestone event.”",

    "fullText": "Hims & Hers (HIMS) stock fell as much as 27% Monday after the Food and Drug Administration announced Friday that the agency planned to take \"decisive steps\" to crack down on the sale of compounded GLP-1s, such as those sold by the company.\n\nThe company is also facing a lawsuit filed on Monday by Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of Ozempic, which seeks to bar Hims & Hers from selling compounded versions of its weight-loss drugs.\n\nIn its Friday statement, the FDA announced \"its intent to take decisive steps to restrict GLP-1 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) intended for use in non-FDA-approved compounded drugs that are being mass-marketed by companies — including Hims & Hers and other compounding pharmacies — as similar alternatives to FDA-approved drugs.\"\n\nPopular GLP-1 drugs include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro, among other products on the market.\n\nShares ended the day down just over 16%.\n\nHims & Hers sells cheaper versions of these drugs directly to consumers in \"compounded\" forms, which differ slightly from FDA-approved versions but contain the same active ingredient. In a statement, Hims & Hers called Novo's lawsuit was the latest example of, \"Big Pharma...weaponizing the US judicial system to limit consumer choice.\"\n\nIn its statement on Friday, the FDA also said it was \"taking steps to combat misleading direct-to-consumer advertising and marketing following warning letters that were sent in the fall of 2025.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"In promotional materials, companies cannot claim that non-FDA-approved compounded products are generic versions or the same as drugs approved by FDA. They also cannot state compounded drugs use the same active ingredient as the FDA-approved drugs or that compounded drugs are clinically proven to produce results for the patient.\"\n\nWith Monday's decline, Hims & Hers stock is down about 50% this year.

    "fullText": "The following is the transcript of the interview with Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 8, 2026. Dr. Gottlieb also sits on the boards of Pfizer and United Health Care.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He is also on the board of Pfizer and United Healthcare. Dr Gottlieb, welcome back.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have a history of making accurate predictions that are also terrifying on this program, and it was around this time last year that you said you were very concerned about the measles outbreak and that it would spread. You're right. In South Carolina, about 900 reported cases, largest outbreak since measles was declared eliminated. You got out in Disneyland in California, two cases. Here in DC, cases detected. Should we avoid mass gatherings? How concerned should we be?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I don't think we should be worried about mass gatherings at this point. I think that this is going to get worse unfortunately, before it resolves. Last year, we had 2000 cases. This year so far, we have 750 cases reported. It's going to be a lot higher by the end of the year. I think this is going to be a long cycle right now. If you look at the people who are getting infected with measles, the majority of people are between the ages of five and 17. They're not toddlers, and we're seeing vaccination rates decline among toddlers, really, as part of a broader movement away from pediatric vaccines in this country, as those toddlers age into school age settings, the scope of the measles outbreaks are going to continue to escalate in this country. If you think back to the early 1990s, 1991 there were about 25,000 cases of measles. 1992 we had about 10,000. Vaccination rates had declined in the 1990s only about 88% of Americans children were vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella. Right now it's about 90% but in some of the states where you're seeing these outbreaks, the rate is as low as 81% in Alaska. 88% in a number of states that are having outbreaks right now. So we're starting to get down to lower levels, and I think that's going to continue to decline. And again, as these children who aren't getting vaccinated age into school age settings, they're going to start spreading broader and larger outbreaks. So I think this is a long cycle, especially now that this has gotten embedded in political psyche in this country. I think this is a generational change.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, well, and those, those percentages you point out are important because we're below herd immunity. And as I understand it, it's not just the United States, Britain, Canada, Spain, a number of European and Central Asian countries lost their measles elimination status. This is a global anti-vaccine movement, it would seem.\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think that that's right. And I think a lot of this comes out of the Covid pandemic, where people felt compelled to take vaccines that they had hesitations around through state action. I thought that was a mistake at the time. I still think its mistake we talked about in this show that would breed an anti-vaccine backlash. And I think that's what we're seeing, and it's given voice to a lot of people who are anti-vax from the outset, who are now gaining political resonance and starting to drive a lot of the policy agenda, including at the Department of Health and Human Services. So the scope of these is going to continue to grow. It's not just MMR, it's diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis as well. We're seeing pertussis outbreaks in this country. Those are going to continue to grow. So we're in a long cycle right now, and I think it's important that we continue to educate people about the importance of these vaccines, especially the MMR vaccines. Measles is very contagious, and as you said, the herd immunity rate is about 95% vaccination in a community in certain pockets of this country, we're well below that. You look at some states, there's pockets as communities where their vaccination rate is about 70% and so that's where you're seeing the outbreaks, particularly in South Carolina, Texas, Florida has an outbreak right now. There's been big outbreaks in Utah and Arizona as well. Arizona had 250 cases. Utah, about the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There was a hearing this week with Dr Jay Bhattacharya. He's the NIH director. He did say people should get their measles shot. But he was pressed about vaccines, and he was testifying under oath, and here is what he said.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Do vaccines cause autism? Tell that to the American people, yes, no.\n\nJAY BHATTACHARYA: No, I do not believe that the measles vaccine causes autism.\n\nSEN. SANDERS: I didn't ask measles. Do vaccines cause autism?\n\nJAY BHATTACHARYA: For- I have not seen a study that suggests any single vaccine causes autism.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I played those remarks because I think it's important to hear them directly. The director claimed the next day in a social media post that he was mischaracterized and that he's fully aligned with Secretary Kennedy on finding the root cause of autism. Why is the messaging so muddled here? Is it that political embeddedness you talked about?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think a lot of the appointed officials in the sdministration who work for Secretary Kennedy are reluctant to buck the secretary on this and the secretary has been a long standing anti-vaccine advocate. He really led the charge throughout the last two decades for the anti vaccine movement, and now that he's in that position, he's able to give much more voice to it and embed it in official policy. You know, Jay's comments there were very carefully worded. He said no single vaccine causes autism. The only vaccine that's been studied, as he pointed out in his Twitter post extensively is- is the MMR vaccine. So he backed away from those comments the next day, I think because he and a lot of other officials are reluctant to buck the secretary. Mehmet Oz this morning was speaking to this issue, and he was very clear, and that's what I would expect of him. He's a good physician. He was very clear on the importance of getting the MMR vaccine. I think it's important that more officials step forward with those very clear messages.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have an op-ed talking about your personal experience with cancer, and you link it to past infection with a virus. Can you explain that?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, I think a large part of the anti-vaccine dogma, if you will, is that these infections aren't that serious to begin with, and therefore any risk theoretical or actual from the vaccines themselves isn't worth it. It's not worth taking the vaccine to mitigate a virus that in and of itself is incidental. That's not true. I had Epstein-Barr Virus. It led to the development of a B cell lymphoma. We know that HSV-1 is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Enterovirus is associated with type one diabetes. We now believe EBV virus is associated with multiple sclerosis and may be a causative factor in lupus as well. So viruses do have long term sequela.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Dr. Gottlieb, it's an important read and another good point. Thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.\n\nLuigi Mangione yells out in court as judge sets New York trial for June\n\nRacist video shared by Trump depicting Obamas as apes taken down\n\n50 years later, the Eagles' greatest hits still soar",

    "fullText": "More than 38,000 gallons of distilled water have been recalled because of the presence of an unidentified black substance, according to WJW.\n\nOn Jan. 17, WJW reported that Meijer initiated a voluntary recall affecting six states: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe product in question was Meijer Steam Distilled Water, sold in one-gallon jugs. Affected items shared a lot code (39-222 #3), UPC (041250841197), and expiry date (Oct. 4, 2026).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration indicated that a \"floating black foreign substance in the product\" precipitated the multistate recall, but the agency neither identified the material nor provided any further information.\n\nDistilled water is, per WebMD, \"ideal for when purity is important,\" as it is processed to remove even traces of bacteria, minerals, contaminants, and impurities.\n\nCommon uses for distilled water include infant formula, continuous positive airway pressure machine reservoirs, and lab testing.\n\nIn medical environments, distilled water is used to clean critical equipment, such as dialysis machines.\n\nDistilled water is primarily used when even filtered water isn't sufficiently pure.\n\nConsequently, contaminated distilled water could pose a larger risk to consumers, who are likely using it in neti pots, to mix baby formula, or to provide medical care in home settings.\n\nThe FDA's official recall notice indicated Meijer recalled the product Nov. 13, but the earliest media mention was by Allrecipes on Jan. 9.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe site observed that the FDA had not yet assigned a risk classification to the recall; the FDA eventually designated it a Class 2 recall Jan. 20.\n\nAccording to the FDA, a Class 2 recall is when exposure to or use of what the agency calls a \"violative product\" may \"cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\"\n\nMeijer's distilled water recall wasn't the first with an apparent lag between the retailer's voluntary actions and the FDA's involvement; in October, the FDA took several weeks to announce a market-specific Coca-Cola recall.\n\nIn April, Reuters reported that sweeping federal civil service cuts across agencies led to a reduction in FDA \"food safety quality checks.\" In addition, cuts at the Department of Agriculture further imperiled food quality.\n\nSidelined officials warned that staff reductions could leave Americans vulnerable to risks, as the FDA announced it would no longer allocate funds to monitor milk quality.\n\nIn a Jan. 13 Guardian report, several former officials expressed alarm about delayed FDA warnings, citing a 2025 listeria outbreak that killed six people.\n\n\"I am concerned that … it's like that kids' game Jenga where you pile up all these wooden pieces. And if you pull one out from the bottom or even the middle, the whole thing falls apart,\" said Sandra Eskin, former USDA undersecretary.\n\nSeveral officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\n\"I believe that this decimation of the federal workforce will set us back as a country for decades. We are no longer a world leader in public health, and that's a scary thing,\" a former FDA employee confessed to the Guardian.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.\n\nThe device – which uses an approach called trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) - was cleared for use by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to treat ADHD in 2019 based on a small study. These new findings from a larger multicentre trial, published in the journal Nature Medicine, suggest authorities should revisit the original evidence that supported the FDA clearance. Notably, TNS is currently not recommended for use in the UK by NICE guidelines.\n\nThe trial was run in collaboration with University of Southampton and funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, a partnership between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC), with further support from the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects five to eight per cent of school-age children worldwide and is associated with age-inappropriate problems with attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that can impair everyday functioning. Stimulant medications improve symptoms in 70 per cent of those who take them in the short term but there is less evidence of their long-term effects.\n\nTo provide an alternative to medication researchers have developed and trialled approaches that use non-invasive stimulation of the brain, working on the regions that have been identified as influential in ADHD.\n\nOne of these approaches involves stimulating the trigeminal nerve (TNS), targeting a branch of this facial nerve which is thought to activate the brainstem and from there other brain regions that may be relevant to ADHD, in particular the locus coeruleus, which plays a role in arousal which is typically diminished in people with ADHD. TNS is thought to stimulate other brain regions associated with attention such as frontal and thalamic areas via the brainstem in a bottom-up manner.\n\nA previous small trial in the US with 62 children diagnosed with ADHD has shown that when TNS is applied every night for eight hours for one month it is effective in reducing symptoms – this research led to its clearance by the FDA for use in the US. However, the control condition involved no stimulation, and blinding was not tested after one month, raising questions about a potential placebo effect.\n\nThis new UK clinical trial across two sites in London and Southampton tested TNS in a wider range of 150 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD aged between eight and 18 years old and applied a more rigorous placebo condition. Half of the sample received real TNS for about 9 hours every night for four weeks through battery-powered electrodes applied to the forehead. The other half of the sample received the ‘sham’ condition where electrodes were still applied to the forehead every night for four weeks but participants only received 30 seconds of stimulation every hour at a lower frequency and pulse width, which are thought to be non-effective and hence act as a “control” condition.\n\nOur study shows how important it is to design an appropriate placebo condition in clinical trials of brain therapies. There is a large placebo effect with high-tech brain therapies, in particular for patients and families that have an expectation that they can adjust brain differences associated with ADHD. It is hence paramount to control for placebo effects in modern brain therapies to avoid false hopes.\n\nDr Aldo Conti, postdoctoral researcher at IoPPN and at Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London and first author on the study said: “This multicentre trial was designed to address key limitations of the previous pilot study that informed FDA clearance of TNS for ADHD, particularly by using a rigorously controlled sham condition that supported successful blinding across the treatment period. Unlike the earlier study, which was limited to younger children, we also included adolescents, a clinically important group given well-documented challenges with long-term medication adherence. These design choices enabled a more robust and clinically relevant evaluation of TNS.”\n\nThe trial showed that TNS was safe with no serious adverse events and most participants considered it a mild or no burden to use. However, the results showed no significant change in ADHD symptoms, objective measures of hyperactivity, attention and associated behaviours around mood and sleep.\n\nProfessor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at University of Southampton and study lead for the Southampton site, stated: “Rigorous evidence, such as that generated by this study, is essential for supporting shared decision-making regarding interventions for ADHD. It empowers individuals with ADHD and their families to make informed choices about the treatment of ADHD. Clinicians, individuals with ADHD, and their families need to know which treatments work, and which do not based on the best evidence.”\n\nThe trial was run by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit and recruitment involved the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinics within the following NHS trusts: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare (previously known as SOLENT NHS Trust), Central and North-West London NHS Foundation Trust, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and South-West London and St. George’s Mental Health NHS Trust.\n\nExternal trigeminal nerve stimulation in youth with ADHD: a randomized, sham-controlled, phase 2b trial by Conti, A.A. et al was published in Nature Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04075-x\n\nProfessor of Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate",
