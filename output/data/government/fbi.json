    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA nearly 2,000-year-old tombstone of a Roman sailor was discovered in the backyard of a New Orleans home.\n\nThe Latin inscription on the grave marker prompted a search for the origin story of the marble stone.\n\nThe buzz about the find in the local news led to the discovery of just how the ancient piece crossed the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis story is a collaboration with Biography.com.\n\nThe discovery of a nearly 2,000-year-old Roman sailor’s tombstone wasn’t so much an excavation as a backyard cleanup at a New Orleans home.\n\nWhen Daniella Santoro and her husband, Aaron Lorenz, started clearing away brush in the yard of their home, they uncovered a marble slab with what appeared to be a Latin inscription carved on it. In a strange turn of events, the slab turned out to be the grave marker of a Roman military sailor originally housed in an Italian museum. How it ended up 5,250 miles away is quite a journey.\n\nWhen Santoro, an anthropologist at Tulane University and the owner of the historic home on Cambronne Street in the Carrollton neighborhood in New Orleans, initially found the slab, she thought it could have been from one of the city’s historic cemeteries. She contacted D. Ryan Gray, professor of anthropology at the University of New Orleans.\n\n“I never feel like I’ve seen it all,” Gray wrote on the website of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans. “There are always surprises and new mysteries to solve.”\n\nThose new mysteries don’t often come with international intrigue that include World War II, garden decor, and the F.B.I.\n\nWith no cemeteries close by, Gray asked for help from a colleague at the University of Innsbruck and scholars at Tulane to decipher the Latin. They independently concluded that the stone featured a Roman funerary inscription for a sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus.\n\nThe second-century C.E. inscription read: “To the Spirits of the Dead for Sextus Congenius Verus, solider of the praetorian fleet Misenensis, from the tribe of the Bessi [of Thrace], (who) lived 42 years (and) served 22 in the military, on the trireme [warship] Asclepius. Atilius Carus and Vettius Longinus, his heirs, made (this) for him, well deserving.”\n\nMore shocking: this inscription was already known in the world of anthropology. “In fact, a stone fitting that exact description was missing from the city museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, near where it had originally been found,” Gray said. “This was a bit of a surprise, and it changed the scope of our inquiries.”\n\nAfter the backyard discovery and identification, the F.B.I.’s Art Crime Team got involved, picking up the one-foot-wide stone and keeping it in custody while the repatriation process kicked off to return the grave marker back to its original home.\n\nGetting the stone back to the Italian museum was one thing, but figuring out how it got to New Orleans was another.\n\nGray started investigating the owners of the home from the 20th century, when the house stayed in the same family for much of the 1900s. Thanks to the U.S. Census, Gray deduced that Frank Simon purchased the house for his family in 1909 while he was working at a wholesale shoe company. His daughters, working as seamstresses, later owned the home. But those facts provided no clues as to how a stone moved from Italy to Louisiana.\n\nWith that dead-end in place, Gray turned to the next-door neighbor, a U.S. Navy veteran who served in World War II. That, too, was a non-starter, showing he deployed in the Pacific and was never stationed in Italy.\n\nSusann Lusnia, associate professor of classical studies at Tulane, took the search to Italy, where she was already planning a summer research stint. She met with staff and curators at the city museum and learned the headstone’s original site, located northwest of Rome, was a major port for the Roman empire and remained a port into the 20th century. Allied bombing raids in 1943 and 1944 targeted the city in World War II, and the museum was destroyed and collections lost.\n\nLusnia discovered the marker was likely lost in the chaos after the war and confirmed the 34th division of the Fifth Army of the U.S. traveled through the town after liberating Rome, with units remaining in the area. At that point, Gray figured there had to be a connection between the soldiers of World War II and the slab, but he had no way of sifting through so many names.\n\nThat’s when crowdsourcing finished the job. As the local news picked up the story, a previous homeowner at the Cambronne Street site heard about the mysterious headstone and immediately made the connection, remembering placing the stone in the garden while planting a tree at her new house two decades ago.\n\n“I just thought it was a piece of art,” said Erin Scott O’Brien, according to Preservation in Print. “I had no idea it was a 2,000-year-old relic.”\n\nO’Brien’s grandfather, Charles Paddock Jr., served in the U.S. Army during World War II, stationed in Italy for a time. He returned to New Orleans in 1946 with his new wife, Adele, who he met in Italy. Charles taught at Loyola University and the tablet in question sat in a cabinet in his Baccich Street home. But with both grandparents passing in the 1980s, O’Brien didn’t know its significance. She ended up with what she thought was a decorative piece and added it to the backyard décor over two decades ago.\n\n“I was really thinking we’d have our list of possible people through whom it could have ended up here,” Gray said. “I didn’t really expect to actually find the actual person, so it’s pretty exciting to know how it ended up here.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "James Gagliano told CNN's Pamela Brown that he's not convinced the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie is attributable to a traditional kidnapping.",
    "fullText": "Former FBI supervisory special agent James Gagliano told CNN’s Pamela Brown that he’s not convinced the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie is attributable to a traditional kidnapping during a Monday morning interview.\n\nGuthrie, the 84-year-old mother of Today Show host Savannah Guthrie, was reported missing on February 1, and authorities have cited evidence found at the elder Guthrie’s home as reason why they’re treating the case as a likely kidnapping case.\n\nDuring their conversation on Monday, Gagliano explained to Brown why he’s not sure about the theory:\n\nBROWN: The first plea from the Guthrie family, it stressed the urgency of releasing her, their 84-year-old mother. As we know, has serious health issues, desperately needs her medications. We’re now in day nine of her presumably not having those meds. There was no mention of that in this new video. What did you make of that?\n\nGAGLIANO: Yeah, well, you mentioned it. So we have an octogenarian, a woman who’s 84 years old. She obviously has heart conditions, needs medications. And Pam, I’ll give you a stat here. Do you know the percentage of kidnappings that occur of 80-year-olds? It’s like infinitesimal. It’s less than one half of 1%. That’s why this case, again, is so baffling and confounding.\n\nBROWN: And are you convinced it’s a kidnapping?\n\nGAGLIANO: Am I convinced that this was an actual kidnapping?\n\nBROWN: Like an abduction, like they took her-\n\nGAGLIANO: No, and I’ll give you this-, yeah, and I’ll tell you this: there are numbers of ways to conduct kidnappings, right? There’s a new craze of this, and again, we saw this south of the border when I was stationed there called virtual kidnappings where they do everything they can to make you believe that they have your loved one in their quote, unquote “possession” when they don’t. And they’re acting quickly, they’re utilizing AI now, artificial intelligence, to help, you know, cause this fog of vagaries so that the families are panicked and do what they need to do. It’s just, there’s so many questions here and the fact that the kidnappers, if this was a kidnapping, had a 14-hour head start from the time she was dropped off at home, supposedly at 10 o’clock, until the family notified law enforcement sometime around noon the next day, and you see the flurry of law enforcement efforts back and forth. I don’t think there’s anything to be taken from that. People are reading too much into that. That’s the normal progression in an investigation where one lead might trick off another lead, and you move from one thing to the other. And lastly, two things are gonna solve this case: one is good detective work that’s flat footwork, knocking on doors, talking to people, canvassing, interviewing people. And the second piece of this, and the biggest one, is the digital imagery, the digital exhaust that investigators are going through right now from the kidnappers’, quote unquote, “kidnappers'” ransom note. From the door ring bell that was removed, but they might still be able to harvest some forensic evidence there. Things like that are probably gonna solve this case, and we all hope and pray it’s gonna have a good conclusion.\n\nThe post Ex-FBI Special Agent Tells CNN Why He Thinks Nancy Guthrie Disappearance May Not Be ‘Kidnapping’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI collected ample proof that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused underage girls but found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men, an Associated Press review of internal Justice Department records shows.\n\nVideos and photos seized from Epstein’s homes in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands didn’t depict victims being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.\n\nAn examination of Epstein’s financial records, including payments he made to entities linked to influential figures in academia, finance and global diplomacy, found no connection to criminal activity, said another internal memo in 2019.\n\nSummarizing the investigation in an email last July, agents said “four or five” Epstein accusers claimed other men or women had sexually abused them. But, the agents said, there “was not enough evidence to federally charge these individuals.”\n\nThe AP and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential, that the Justice Department released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act and it is possible those records contain evidence overlooked by investigators.\n\nHere are takeaways from what the documents show about the FBI investigation and why U.S. authorities ultimately decided to close it without additional charges.\n\nThe Epstein investigation began in 2005, when the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported that she had been molested at the millionaire’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. Then-Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta struck a deal letting Epstein plead guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. Sentenced to 18 months in jail, Epstein was free by mid-2009.\n\nIn 2018, a series of Miami Herald stories about the plea deal prompted federal prosecutors to take a fresh look at the accusations.\n\nEpstein was arrested in July of 2019. One month later, he killed himself in his jail cell.\n\nA year later, prosecutors charged Epstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, saying she’d recruited several of his victims and sometimes joined the sexual abuse. Convicted in 2021, Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term.\n\nLack of evidence for coconspirators\n\nProsecution memos, case summaries and other documents made public in the department’s latest release of Epstein-related records show that FBI agents and federal prosecutors diligently pursued potential coconspirators. Even seemingly outlandish and incomprehensible claims, called in to tip lines, were examined.\n\nSome allegations couldn’t be verified, investigators wrote.\n\nIn 2011 and again in 2019, investigators interviewed Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who in lawsuits and news interviews had accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with numerous men, including Britain’s former Prince Andrew.\n\nInvestigators said they confirmed that Giuffre had been sexually abused by Epstein. But other parts of her story were problematic.\n\nGiuffre acknowledged writing a partly fictionalized memoir of her time with Epstein containing descriptions of things that didn’t take place. She had also offered shifting accounts in interviews with investigators, they wrote.\n\nTwo other Epstein victims who Giuffre had claimed were also “lent out” to powerful men told investigators they had no such experience, prosecutors wrote in a 2019 internal memo.\n\nInvestigators seized a multitude of videos and photos from Epstein’s electronic devices and homes in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They found CDs, hard copy photographs and at least one videotape containing nude images of females.\n\nNo videos or photos showed Epstein victims being sexually abused, none showed any males with any of the nude females, and none contained evidence implicating anyone other than Epstein and Maxwell, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey wrote in an email for FBI officials last year.\n\nHad they existed, the government “would have pursued any leads they generated,” Comey wrote. “We did not, however, locate any such videos.”\n\nInvestigators who scoured Epstein’s bank records found payments to more than 25 women who appeared to be models — but no evidence that he was engaged in prostituting women to other men, prosecutors wrote.\n\nProsecutors weighed the possibility of charging some of Epstein’s close associates, including an assistant and business clients, but ultimately decided against it because of lack of evidence.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in February 2025 that Epstein’s never-before-seen “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now.” But FBI agents wrote superiors saying the client list didn't exist.\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2024, about three weeks before President Joe Biden left office, then-FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate reached out through subordinates to ask \"whether our investigation to date indicates the ‘client list,’ often referred to in the media, does or does not exist,” according to an email summarizing his query.\n\nA day later, an FBI official replied that the case agent had confirmed no client list existed.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2025, two days before Bondi’s Fox News appearance, an FBI supervisory special agent wrote: “While media coverage of the Jeffrey Epstein case references a ‘client list,’ investigators did not locate such a list during the course of the investigation.”\n\nAaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___ The AP is reviewing the documents released by the Justice Department in collaboration with journalists from CBS, NBC, MS NOW and CNBC. Journalists from each newsroom are working together to examine the files and share information about what is in them. Each outlet is responsible for its own independent news coverage of the documents.",

    "description": "Nancy Guthrie's disappearance has prompted growing concern as investigators work to determine the reason for her abduction.",
    "fullText": "Nancy Guthrie's disappearance has prompted growing concern as investigators work to determine whether her abduction was financially motivated or tied to her famous daughter, Savannah Guthrie.\n\nWhile an alleged ransom note demands millions in cryptocurrency, a former CIA and FBI official believes the crime may stem from fixation or resentment linked to the TV personality's visibility.\n\nAs more troubling details emerge, the case of Savannah Guthrie's mom's disappearance is being increasingly viewed as a deliberate, targeted act rather than a random crime.\n\nAccording to former CIA officer and FBI special agent Tracy Walder, Nancy Guthrie's abduction may be driven more by her daughter Savannah Guthrie's public profile than by financial motives, despite an alleged ransom note demanding millions in cryptocurrency.\n\nSpeaking to Page Six, Walder stated that while Savannah's earnings as a \"Today\" show anchor are largely public knowledge, far wealthier individuals exist.\n\n\"I am not convinced it's fully about money,\" she said. Instead, Walder suggested the abduction could be rooted in either an unhealthy fixation on Savannah or resentment tied to her work as a journalist.\n\n\"I, in my gut, feel like this is someone that either had some kind of obsession with Savannah because of how high profile she is, and this was a way to potentially get to her. Or this is a person that has some kind of beef with Savannah because of whatever story she covered or whoever she interviewed,\" Walder continued. \"I think you can kind of go two different ways. Someone who had a full obsession with her, or someone that was upset with her.\"\n\nWalder further noted that Savannah's visibility may have made her family a target in ways they never anticipated.\n\n\"Savannah is such a public person,\" the ex-FBI agent said. \"I don't think she would have ever thought something like this could happen, but I think it's a reminder to us that we need to make sure [personal information] stays private.\"\n\nWalder believes the circumstances surrounding Nancy's disappearance point to planning rather than chance.\n\nShe previously suggested Nancy may have been \"stalked for some time,\" noting the perpetrator's apparent familiarity with the home and its security systems.\n\nBased on the timeline released by authorities, Walder estimated the individual may have spent up to 45 minutes at the property.\n\n\"There's no way this is a robbery gone wrong,\" she said. \"You're not going to bring the person with you. There's no way this is random.\"\n\nAs investigators assess motive, authorities have revealed new details about the case timeline.\n\nNancy, 84, was reported missing on Sunday, February 1, after failing to attend church.\n\nPima County Sheriff Chris Nanos later confirmed that her doorbell camera went offline at approximately 1:47 a.m., and investigators believe she was taken from her home while asleep.\n\nInvestigators are now focused on a troubling gap in the surveillance timeline. Although the camera went offline shortly before 2 a.m., motion was still recorded at 2:12 a.m., leaving approximately 20 minutes unaccounted for.\n\nNBC News law enforcement analyst Tom Winter suggested the disruption may have been intentional.\n\nAccording to Winter, the person responsible may have removed the camera as a way to \"test\" whether authorities would respond immediately, returning to the property only after determining it was safe to do so.\n\nHe cautioned, however, that details about which camera detected the later motion remain unclear.\n\nDuring a Thursday press conference, Sheriff Nanos said authorities are treating the case as an active abduction and are pursuing all leads.\n\nHe also confirmed that the blood found outside the home belonged to Nancy, indicating she was harmed during the incident.\n\nFederal officials have since intensified their involvement. FBI Phoenix Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke disclosed that an alleged ransom note referenced specific items linked to Nancy, including an Apple Watch and a floodlight near her home.\n\nTMZ founder Harvey Levin, whose outlet received the letters, said it also suggested a limited geographic area around Tucson, though he emphasized that the email's origin could not be traced.\n\n\"There is a radius around Tucson, [Ariz.], that they kind of disclose in this demand letter,\" Levin noted. \"There are real reasons, based on what's written there, that I believe that this person is in the radius of the Tucson area. Authorities … have a radius, and that's something.\"\n\nAccording to the LA Times, the alleged ransom note has further intensified concern. Sources familiar with the letters described them as \"carefully crafted\" and containing details not previously made public.\n\nThe message reportedly outlines two deadlines, one on February 5 at 5 p.m. and a second on Monday, with unspecified consequences if demands are not met.\n\nAs reported by The Blast, Levin, who reviewed one of three identical letters, said the upcoming \"Monday deadline is far more consequential\" and confirmed the bitcoin address listed was valid.\n\nThe note reportedly opens by stating that Nancy is fine but \"scared\" and urges that all communication remain anonymous.",

    "title": "Apple's 'Lockdown Mode' Could Stop the Government From Breaking Into Your iPhone",
    "description": "Lockdown Mode saved a journalist's iPhone from the FBI. Do you need it?",
    "fullText": "In January, the FBI made headlines after it raided the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson. It was a shocking case of law enforcement not just overriding one journalist's privacy, but the integrity of the entire news organization. The devices the FBI seized—which included personal devices as well as a Washington Post-issued laptop—contained Natanson's personal contacts, correspondences, and the Slack channels of the Washington Post itself.\n\nBut while the FBI was able to access some of the devices, it was not able to access Natanson's iPhone. That's because the device was in Lockdown Mode, which prevented the FBI's Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) from breaking into it. This isn't a setting that is exclusive to journalists: You have this option baked into your iPhone as well, and can choose to turn it on at any time. The thing is, unless you're a high-profile target, you probably don't want to.\n\nLockdown Mode is an option on iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs, designed for users who could be the target of sophisticated cyberattacks. Think politicians, businessmen, activists, and, of course, journalists—really, anyone high-profile that works or takes action in a way that could draw the ire of powerful organizations or governments.\n\nBecause attackers target devices with spyware, the goal of Lockdown Mode is to reduce the attack surface of your device in order to prevent potential cyberattacks from working. Attackers can install spyware on a target's device in a number of ways, through links, attachments, wired connections, and file downloads, the same way you can install malware by clicking a malicious link in an email, or downloading a corrupt extension from the web. Lockdown Mode locks down these vulnerabilities and eliminates as many potential attack routes as possible.\n\nTo achieve this, Lockdown Mode severely impacts a number of functions you may use on your device every day. According to Apple, that includes the following:\n\nMessages: Lockdown Mode will block most message attachment types, other than \"certain images, video, and audio.\" Links and link previews are blocked.\n\nWeb browsing: The feature blocks \"complex web technologies,\" which could impact how certain websites load or function. You may not see certain web fonts, and you may see missing image icons in place of pictures.\n\nFaceTime: Incoming FaceTime calls are blocked, except for contacts you have called within the past 30 days. You can't use SharePlay or take Live Photos in FaceTime calls.\n\nApple services: Invitations to Apple services like invites to manage a smart home are blocked, unless you have previously invited that person. GameCenter will not work, and Focuses will not work \"as expected.\"\n\nDevice connections: Your device needs to be unlocked before it can communicate with another computer. In addition, your Mac also requires your explicit approval before the connection can be made.\n\nWireless connectivity: You won't automatically join non-secure wifi networks, and you will disconnect from existing non-secure wifi networks. Lockdown Mode also blocks 2G and 3G cellular support.\n\nConfiguration profiles: You can't install configuration profiles, and the device can't enroll in Mobile Device Management.\n\nApple makes a point to say that phone calls and \"plain text messages\" will work as normal, however incoming calls won't ring on your Apple Watch. Emergency SOS also will continue to work.\n\nThese restrictions make it much more difficult for a bad actor to install spyware on your device, though it also makes it more difficult to use your device. A shared album invite could contain malware, but by removing the feature entirely, you miss out on photos from friends and family. Any spyware coming from a malicious link or image will be blocked, but if you frequently send photos, videos, and other attachments in Messages, you'll miss out.\n\nThat's why these measures are really designed only for individuals who think they'll be targeted by sophisticated actors. It seems that could include governments secretly installing spyware on targets' devices, or the FBI stealing your device in a raid. It's worth noting that the FBI was able to access Natanson's other devices, including a MacBook Pro that unlocked with her fingerprint. The agency's warrant compelled Natanson to unlock her devices with biometrics if they were enabled. Lockdown Mode could not have prevented that, so it's not clear why the FBI didn't force Natanson to unlock the iPhone in question, too.\n\nIf you understand the restrictions, but still want to try Lockdown Mode, you'll need to be running the following software version on each of the Apple devices you want to use Lockdown Mode with:\n\nApple Watch: watchOS 10 or later\n\nApple says \"additional protections\" are available for iOS 17, iPadOS 17, or macOS Sonoma or later. In addition, you should update your device to the latest software version before turning on Lockdown Mode if you want all the latest protections.\n\nYou can turn on Lockdown Mode on any of your Apple devices, but you must do so individually on each. You'll find the option at the bottom of the \"Privacy & Security\" section in Settings (System Settings on Mac). Hit \"Turn On Lockdown Mode,\" then review the pop-up that appears and choose \"Turn On Lockdown Mode\" again. You'll need to choose to \"Turn On & Restart,\" then enter your device's password or passcode for the feature to take effect.",

    "description": "The FBI is looking into all leads.",
    "fullText": "The investigation continues into the disappearance of Today host Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nancy Guthrie, but the FBI just made their first arrest related to the case.\n\nFBI Phoenix Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke announced at a press conference on February 5 that a suspect was arrested in connection with the fake ransom note sent to news outlets on February 3, which the FBI later denied the validity of. “We have made one arrest related to an imposter ransom demand, and a complaint will be presented to a magistrate judge later today,” Janke said. “You will get more on that from the FBI and our U.S. Attorney’s office here in Arizona when it becomes available.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie's Sister Recalls Her Mom's Last Movements as Police Address Reports Her Husband Is the Prime Suspect in the Abduction Case\n\nOfficials Reveal if They Think Savannah Guthrie's Mom Is Still 'Alive' After Concerning Evidence Sparked the Involvement of Homicide Detectives\n\nHe continued, “There’s no evidence to connect this to Nancy’s case. It was someone that was trying to profit off it.”\n\nJanke also issued a warning against those planning to offer fake evidence as a way to secure the $50,000 reward for Nancy’s whereabouts. “My next message is to those imposters who are trying to take advantage and profit from this situation. We will investigate and ensure you are held accountable for your actions,” Janke said. “This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well being. You still have the time to do the right thing before this becomes a worse, much worse scenario for you.”\n\nTMZ reported on February 3 that it received an alleged ransom note demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin for the release of Savannah’s mother. According to TMZ, the note was sent on Tuesday morning and included a specific Bitcoin address for the payment to be sent, which the outlet verified was real.\n\nThe FBI’s arrest over the fake ransom note came less than a day after Mary Coleman, an anchor for Arizona’s KOLD 13 News, which also received the note via email, claimed it was “clear after a couple sentences” that it “might not be a hoax.”\n\n“A lot of it is information that only someone who was holding her for ransom would know,” she said in an appearance on CNN on February 4. “Some very sensitive information and things that people who weren’t there when she was taken captive wouldn’t know.”\n\nShe continued, “We immediately sent that information over to the sheriff’s department … One of the detectives did get back to us and asked us for some more information so that they can start searching for an IP address, things of that nature, to try and figure out what people are responsible here.”\n\nColeman added that the note “included a dollar amount, a deadline” and other dteails that only “Guthrie’s abductor might know, so that definitely raised some red flags.”\n\nThe arrest over the bogus note also comes after Savannah and her siblings, sister Annie and brother Camron, posted an Instagram video with a plea to Nancy’s potential abductor. “We too have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media,” Savannah said. “As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please, reach out to us.”\n\nSavannah went on to call Nancy “our heart and our home,” before expressing her concern for her mother’s health “She is 84 years old,” Savannah said. “Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,” she said.\n\nShe continued, “On behalf of our family, we want to thank all of you for the prayers for our beloved mom, Nancy. We feel them and we continue to believe that she feels them too. Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She is funny, spunky, and clever. She has grandchildren that adore her and crowd around her and cover her in kisses. She loves fun and adventure. She is a devoted friend. She is full of kindness and knowledge. Talk to her and you’ll see.”\n\nShe ended the video with a message to her mother, “Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God’s precious daughter, Nancy. We believe and know that even in this valley He is with you. Everyone is looking for you mommy, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again. We speak to you every moment and we pray without ceasing and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again. We love you.” She captioned the post, “Bring her home.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "title": "FBI stymied by Apple's Lockdown Mode after seizing journalist's iPhone",
    "description": "Post reporter was compelled to unlock MacBook Pro with fingerprint, however.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has so far been unable to access data from a Washington Post reporter’s iPhone because it was protected by Apple’s Lockdown Mode when agents seized the device from the reporter’s home, the US government said in a court filing.\n\nFBI agents were able to access the reporter’s work laptop by telling her to place her index finger on the MacBook Pro’s fingerprint reader, however. This occurred during the January 14 search at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson.\n\nAs previously reported, the FBI executed a search warrant at Natanson’s home as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally leaking classified data. FBI agents seized an iPhone 13 owned by the Post, one MacBook Pro owned by the Post and another MacBook Pro owned by Natanson, a 1TB portable hard drive, a voice recorder, and a Garmin watch.\n\nGovernment investigators want to read Natanson’s Signal messages, and were able to view at least some of them on her work laptop. The reporter has said she has a contact list of 1,100 current and former government employees in Signal, which she uses for encrypted chats.\n\nThe Justice Department described the search in a court filing that was submitted Friday in US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and noted in a 404 Media article today. The government filing opposes a motion in which the Post and Natanson asked the court to order the return of the seized devices. A federal magistrate judge previously issued a standstill order telling the government to stop searching the devices until the court rules on whether they must be returned.\n\n“The iPhone was found powered on and charging, and its display noted that the phone was in ‘Lockdown’ mode,” the government filing said. After the seized devices were taken to the FBI’s Washington field office, the Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) “began processing each device to preserve the information therein,” the filing said.\n\nCART couldn’t get anything from the iPhone. “Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,” the government filing said.\n\nThe government also submitted a declaration by FBI Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky that said the agency “has paused any further efforts to extract this device because of the Court’s Standstill Order.” The FBI did extract information from the SIM card “with an auto-generated HTML report created by the tool utilized by CART,” but “the data contained in the HTML was limited to the telephone number.”\n\nApple says that LockDown Mode “helps protect devices against extremely rare and highly sophisticated cyber attacks,” and is “designed for the very few individuals who, because of who they are or what they do, might be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats.”\n\nIntroduced in 2022, Lockdown Mode is available for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It must be enabled separately for each device. To enable it on an iPhone or iPad, a user would open the Settings app, tap Privacy & Security, scroll down and tap Lockdown Mode, and then tap Turn on Lockdown Mode.\n\nThe process is similar on Macs. In the System Settings app that can be accessed via the Apple menu, a user would click Privacy & Security, scroll down and click Lockdown Mode, and then click Turn On.\n\n“When Lockdown Mode is enabled, your device won’t function like it typically does,” Apple says. “To reduce the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences might not be available at all.”\n\nLockdown Mode blocks most types of message attachments, blocks FaceTime calls from people you haven’t contacted in the past 30 days, restricts the kinds of browser technologies that websites can use, limits photo sharing, and imposes other restrictions. Users can exclude specific apps and websites they trust from these restrictions, however.\n\nFBI agents had more success getting into Natanson’s other devices, though the Justice Department complained that “Ms. Natanson misled investigators about the devices that were seized. She misrepresented to officers that the devices could not be unlocked with biometrics, possibly in order to prevent the Government from reviewing materials within the scope of the search warrant.”\n\nThe Rozhavsky declaration said that during the home search, FBI agents “advised Natanson that the FBI could not compel her to provide her passcodes,” but “the warrant did give the FBI authority to use Natanson’s biometrics, such as facial recognition or fingerprints, to open her devices. Natanson stated that she did not use biometrics on her devices.”\n\nNatanson’s personal MacBook Pro was powered off when it was found by FBI agents. The Post-owned MacBook Pro was found in a backpack in the kitchen and was powered on and locked. The FBI said an agent “presented Natanson with her open laptop” and “assisted” her in unlocking the device with her finger. The declaration described what happened as follows:\n\nNatanson was reminded the FBI has authority to use her biometrics to unlock the laptop and Natanson repeated that she does not use biometrics on her devices. Natanson was told she must try, in accordance with the authorization in the warrant. The FBI assisted Natanson with applying her right index finger to the fingerprint reader which immediately unlocked the laptop.\n\nIn 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination does not prohibit police officers from forcing a suspect to unlock a phone with a thumbprint scan. That case involved a traffic stop, rather than a home search authorized by a warrant.\n\nThe FBI has so far been unable “to obtain a full physical image” of Natanson’s work laptop, but did make a “limited partial live logical image,” the government filing said. At least some of Natanson’s Signal chat messages were set for auto-deletion, so FBI agents took photos and made audio recordings of the chats, but the government filing said this was done “only for preservation purposes and no substantive review has occurred.”\n\nThe FBI apparently hasn’t gotten any data from Natanson’s personal computer. “Natanson’s personal MacBook Pro is password protected and encrypted and therefore no imaging was effected. The FBI paused any further efforts because of [the] Court’s Standstill Order. No review has occurred,” Rozhavsky wrote.\n\nThe government said it processed data from the voice recorder and 1TB hard drive but has not reviewed the data yet. The Garmin watch wasn’t processed before the court issued a standstill order; “therefore, no processing will occur until further order of the Court,” the declaration said.\n\nThe investigation’s target is Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance and was arrested after being accused of taking classified intelligence reports home. The Justice Department said Washington Post articles contained classified information from those reports, and that the government should be allowed to review the Post reporter’s seized devices in preparation for Perez-Lugones’ trial.\n\nThe government said it was able to read at least some of the Signal messages by reviewing Perez-Lugones’ device. “Prior to his arrest, the FBI consensually reviewed messages between Mr. Perez-Lugones and Ms. Natanson sent via Signal on or around January 7 and 8, 2026… The messages discussed the classification level of certain documents, set forth details about which US government agencies had produced different reports, and explained how certain documents would be referenced in forthcoming news articles,” the Justice Department court filing said.\n\nThe Post argues that a wide-ranging government search of Natanson’s various devices violates the First Amendment and that the government’s legitimate interests could be satisfied with a more limited subpoena. The government claims in response that the Washington Post wants the court “to reimagine the First Amendment as a journalist’s exception to search warrants.”\n\n“Under the reasonableness standard of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), the Government is entitled to maintain this evidence because it is relevant to an ongoing investigation and prosecution,” the Justice Department said. “In addition, the Government cannot be reasonably required to hand over to Movants devices that the Government has probable cause to believe contain its own highly classified information.”\n\nThe government said the Post’s suggestion of a subpoena for specific information from the devices “ignores the obvious risk that evidence could be lost either through a failure to preserve expiring Signal messages or bad faith conduct.” Natanson’s false claim that she did not use biometrics suggests that the Post and Natanson can’t be trusted to preserve documents, the brief said.\n\n“The record confirms the correctness of the Government’s choice to proceed with a search warrant,” the Justice Department said.\n\nThe Post/Natanson motion was supported in a brief filed by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The FBI “seiz[ed] electronic devices that contain [Natanson’s] most sensitive work product alongside confidential communications with her sources,” the brief said. “Only a fraction of the information the Department seized is even imaginably relevant to its stated basis for that intrusion: the leak investigation of a government contractor who has already been identified, charged, and arrested.” The brief urged the court to stop federal agents from searching through “unrelated newsgathering material and doing irreparable damage to the confidentiality on which effective reporting depends.”",

    "description": "Among the latest Epstein files dump is a list of wild complaints made withe the FBI that include wild allegations against President Donald Trump and others.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump arrives for the premiere of first lady Melania Trump’s movie “Melania” at The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center For The Performing Arts, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026, in Washington. \n\nAmong the latest Epstein files dump is a list of wild complaints made with the FBI that include wild allegations against President Donald Trump and others from uncorroborated tips.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced on Friday that thousands of new documents related to the case of convicted child sex predator Jeffrey Epstein were being released.\n\nThe latest drop comes as the administration has faced complaints from critics over its failure to release all the files by a December 19 deadline previously set by Congress.\n\nOn Friday, Blanche announced 3.5 million new files were being released to comply with the Epstein Transparency Act. Among them is a list of allegations made against the president, a former friend of Epstein’s. In FBI email communications — which note some of the allegations come secondhand — various allegations are listed that involve Trump, Epstein, and others.\n\nIt should be noted that these complaints are uncorroborated tips to the FBI, and the existence of those tips does not indicate eventual credibility.\n\nBlanche said the White House had no oversight on the latest documents released. He told Fox News that there has been no evidence of criminal conduct by the president found in the Epstein files.\n\n“In none of these communications, even when doing his best to disparage President Trump, did Epstein suggest President Trump had done anything criminal or had any inappropriate contact with any of his victims,” he said.\n\nTrump himself has long denied any wrongdoing in his friendship with Epstein.\n\nSince their original publication, the complaints mentioning Trump have been removed from the DOJ website with a “page not found” message being given to people trying to search for them. The complaints, however, have been widely copied and shared on social media.\n\nCNN’s Jake Tapper was among those who noted the DOJ pulling the files.\n\nDOJ has since killed this link. This is what was there: https://t.co/urnzMvyccO pic.twitter.com/qXXmQNYhu7\n\nTrump Accused of Raping Teenager\n\nIn a complaint made by a friend, the president was accused of forcing a 13-14-year-old to perform oral sex on him.\n\n“[Redacted] reported an unidentified female friend who was forced to perform oral sex on President Trump approximately 35 years ago in NJ. The friend told Alexis that she was approximately 13-14 years old when this occurred, and the friend allegedly bit President Trump while performing oral sex. The friend was allegedly hit in the face after she laughed about biting President Trump. The friend said she was also abused by Epstein,” the complaint reads.\n\nIn the “response” column, it is noted that an investigator was sent to Washington to conduct an interview.\n\nTrump Accused of Being Present While Newborn ‘Murdered’\n\nAnother in Epstein’s orbit also made allegations of “sex trafficking” and murder. The unidentified person was following up on a tip given to the NYPD in which the person alleged they were raped at 13. The person also alleged Trump regularly paid them to perform sexual acts and claimed he was present when her newborn child was murdered.\n\n“Complainant reported Donald Trump participated regularly in paying money to force her to perform sex acts with him and alleged Trump was present when her uncle murdered her newborn child,” notes on the complaint read.\n\nAccording to the paperwork, there was “no contact made.”\n\nMar-a-Lago ‘Calendar Girls’ Parties\n\nAnother complaint — for which there was no contact information provided — alleged that “calendar girls” parties at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago involved genital measurements for children.\n\n“Jeffrey Epstein would bring the children in and trump would auction them off. He measured the children’s vulva and vaginas by entering a finger and rated the children on tightness,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe person alleged people like Elon Musk, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump were present at these alleged parties.\n\nRobin Leach and Trump’s Head of Security\n\nOne complainant claimed they witnessed a “sex trafficking ring at the Trump Golf Course” in Rancho Palo Verdes, California between 1995 and 1996. The person alleged Ghislaine Maxwell, a former Epstein associate now serving 20 years for sex trafficking, was a “madam” and “broker” for deals involving girls.\n\nThe person claimed they witnessed Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous host Robin Leach “strangle a young girl” at a party. The person also alleged a threat from Trump’s head of security if she “ever talked.” She claimed she was told she would “end up as fertilizer for the back nine holes like the other c*nts” if she spoke about what she had seen.\n\nEpstein Gives Bill Gates Advice on Hiding Alleged STD From Wife\n\nAlso a part of the new file dump is a draft email Epstein was writing to himself in July 2013. In it, he addressed Bill Gates, accusing him of recently disregarding their “friendship.” In the lengthy message, he also made mention of Gates allegedly asking him to delete some past communications.\n\n“TO add insult to the injury you them (sic) implore me to please delete the emails regarding your std, your request that I provide you antibiotics that you can surreptitiously give to Melinda and the description of your penis,” he wrote.\n\nCheck out the Epstein files released so far here.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the latest changes to the available Epstein files.\n\nThe post DOJ Removes New Epstein Files That Mention Wild Trump Sex Allegations, Including Rape first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A man was arrested for pretending to be an FBI agent in an effort to break an inmate out of the Brooklyn prison housing Luigi Mangione, who's awaiting trial over the shooting of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, prosecutors said on Thursday.\n\nMark Anderson showed up at the Metropolitan Detention Center jail claiming to have a court order to let an inmate walk free, federal prosecutors said in a criminal complaint released on Thursday.\n\nAfter Bureau of Prisons officials asked Anderson to identify himself, he produced a Minnesota driver's license and said he had weapons in his backpack, according to the complaint. He also \"displayed and threw at the BOP officers numerous documents,\" the complaint said.\n\nBureau of Prisons officials found a pizza cutter and barbecue fork in the bag, the complaint said.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn have accused Anderson of impersonating an FBI agent. He was expected to appear before a magistrate judge in a federal court on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe criminal complaint does not name Mangione. A law enforcement source told Business Insider that Mangione was the inmate Anderson wanted to free from jail.\n\nAccording to the law enforcement source, Anderson had been working at a pizzeria in the New York City area.\n\nAn attorney for Anderson couldn't immediately be identified. An attorney for Mangione didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMangione has been jailed in the Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024.\n\nHe is still in jail as of Thursday afternoon despite Anderson's alleged efforts, according to Bureau of Prison records.\n\nMangione is due in federal court in Manhattan on Friday morning, when a judge may rule on pending issues, including whether he will face the death penalty at his murder trial. US District Court Judge Margaret Garnett may also rule on whether prosecutors can show jurors key evidence from Mangione's December 9 arrest — including a 9mm handgun and a journal police say they recovered from his backpack.\n\nGarnett scheduled jury selection for the federal charges against Mangione for September. The Manhattan District Attorney's office has asked for a July trial date for its own murder trial against him. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the charges in both cases.\n\nAs the only remaining federal jail in New York City, the MDC holds several high-profile defendants, including former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The MDC also holds Oren and Tal Alexander, the luxury real estate brokers who are defendants in an ongoing rape trial in Manhattan.\n\nIn recent years, the MDC has also held Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nWhile judges and defense attorneys have routinely criticized the MDC for its poor conditions, it doesn't have a history of jailbreaks.\n\nFor more than two years, the jail successfully contained Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, the Mexican drug lord who famously escaped twice from jails in Mexico, both times through tunnels dug underneath the buildings.\n\nCorrection: January 29, 2026 — An earlier version of the story incorrectly attributed the identity of the inmate to charging documents.",

    "description": "The FBI director, Kash Patel, said the inquiry followed a far-right influencer’s post about anti-ICE Signal chats",
    "fullText": "The FBI director, Kash Patel, said the inquiry followed a far-right influencer’s post about anti-ICE Signal chats\n\nThe FBI director, Kash Patel, announced on Monday he was launching a criminal investigation into group chats used by Minneapolis protesters on the Signal messaging app, based on a social media post by the far-right personality Cam Higby.\n\nPatel used the podcast of another rightwing personality, Benny Johnson, to break the news.\n\nHigby had posted on Sunday on X that he had “infiltrated” a group chat on Signal, the widely used communication app that offers effective encryption, populated by anti-ICE organizers in Minneapolis. Higby’s posts appear to show communication between Minneapolis activists in vehicles trying to locate and share the descriptions and license plates of potential ICE vehicles. He argued that the chats have “the sole intention of tracking down federal agents and impeding/assaulting/and obstructing them”.\n\nHigby pushed his disclosures on Johnson’s podcast, The Benny Show, where Johnson demanded a federal investigation.\n\n“This is clearly a coordinated infrastructure,” Johnson said, “and we’d like for the feds to take a crack at trying to get rid of this infrastructure the way they approach the mob or cartels or other terrorist networks, right?”\n\nPatel himself then joined Johnson’s podcast – where he made frequent appearances before becoming FBI director – and confirmed that he would act as suggested.\n\n“As soon as Higby put that post out, I opened an investigation on it,” Patel said.\n\n“We immediately opened up that investigation, because that sort of Signal chat – being coordinated with individuals not just locally in Minnesota, but maybe even around the country – if that leads to a break in the federal statute or a violation of some law, then we are going to arrest people.”\n\nPatel was careful to say he was not investigating peaceful protests or first amendment activity, but added: “You cannot create a scenario that illegally entraps and puts law enforcement in harm’s way.”\n\nKevin Goldberg, vice-president at the Freedom Forum, told the Guardian that impeding or obstructing law enforcement would be illegal, but that when he reviewed the Higby posts he saw nothing obviously illegal.\n\n“I got the sense the [Signal chat] group has been organized for purposes that are fully protected by the first amendment: to observe, to speak and to alert others of possible dangers. I didn’t see anything that impedes or obstructs justice. The claimed ‘doxing’ of law enforcement is not necessary illegal.”\n\nGoldberg said the supreme court in 1958 established the right to organize even in secret as long as there is no illegal activity. “I would want to know what the illegal activity is in this case,” he said.\n\nPatrick Eddington, of the libertarian Cato institute, said the FBI had no business investigating. “The use of encryption is as American as apple pie. The founders used it before during and after the revolution,” he said.\n\n“The notion that Kash Patel, who clearly failed to investigate the criminal conduct of Pete Hegseth now want to go after people for utilizing first amendment protected activity and technology to warn their neighbors about violent out-of-control so-called federal agents policing their neighborhoods is beyond outrageous.”\n\nThe FBI’s quick move to investigate activists based on a far-right provocateur’s media posts comes at the same time the bureau has insisted it is not investigating the killing of Alex Pretti, the veterans affairs nurse shot repeatedly by border patrol agents on Saturday in Minneapolis.\n\nThat investigation is being run by homeland security investigations, HSI, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, according to an interview Patel gave Fox News, and a sworn statement by an HSI official in court.\n\nNBC News reported on Monday that investigators were reviewing body-camera video from the cameras worn by the agents involved in the incident, which could provide more important footage of the killing, which was already widely captured on cellphone cameras from multiple angles.",

    "fullText": "Former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is sharing his concerns about the “media morons” he claims are distorting the truth about American safety.\n\nBongino, who stepped down from his position earlier this month after serving in his role for less than a year, went on a tangent about the media while being interviewed by Fox News on Thursday, accusing the media of having a double standard when it comes to reporting on public safety.\n\nThe topic came up while discussing a recent report from Axios, claiming that according to the Council on Criminal Justice, the U.S. murder rate has reached its lowest level since 1900.\n\nHowever, Fox News claimed that violent crime was already falling to a two-decade low during former President Joe Biden’s final year in office.\n\n“Well, there’s a thousand excuses as to why President Trump and his administration didn’t do it,” he told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “Meanwhile, I lived it. I know what we did and didn’t do for these (expletive).”\n\nBongino then cited a New York Times article, which included interviews with several current and former employees who accused Director of the FBI Kash Patel of making America less safe.\n\n“Do you dipwads even read your own headlines?” Bongino said. “Are you that stupid?\n\n“These are these media morons — people who’ve never spent a day wearing a badge. Never kicked in a door. Never arrested some child predator or some bank robber or some gang member. These morons don’t know anything about the safety status of the country,\" Bongino said.\n\nBongino said the media is a “big, full diaper,” adding that he is “tired of these idiots.”\n\n“What freaking country are these morons living in?” Bongino asked. “I mean, what are they looking at? Are they missing this stuff? These are not small items. That isn’t even — forget — I haven’t even gotten to Maduro being out of power, the Cuban leadership’s crapping their pants, we may acquire portions of Greenland.\"\n\nHannity then commented by saying that the “real Dan Bongino is back,” observing he was more restrained when he held a government title.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Hannity said. “I kind of like the real Dan being back, unfiltered.”\n\nSuffolk DA on Minneapolis: ICE’s, Border Patrol’s tactics ‘threaten citizens everywhere’\n\n‘Nasty profession’: Trump reveals why he skewers people in public he thinks are ‘nice’\n\nTrump calls vocal critic ‘incompetent’ as 2028 presidential race heats up\n\nMass.

    "fullText": "Members of a motorcycle club and a street gang clearly targeted an Indiana judge for assassination, police said Tuesday, days after officers arrested five people in connection with the attack.\n\nPolice and prosecutors at a news conference praised what they characterized as a relentless effort to track down who opened fire on Tippecanoe County Superior Court Judge Steven Meyer and his wife, Kim, at their home in Lafayette on Jan. 18. Both Meyer and his wife suffered gunshot wounds but survived.\n\nThe Lafayette Police Department, the FBI, the Indiana State Police and the Purdue University Police Department launched a search for the shooter that went on for days before apprehending five people in synchronized arrests Thursday evening, including four in Indiana and one in Lexington, Kentucky. Court appearances for the suspects were set for Wednesday in Indiana and Kentucky.\n\n“This attack was more than an assault on two citizens,” LaFayette Police Chief Scott Galloway said. “This was an assault on the rule of law itself.”\n\nProsecutors allege that the attack was designed to derail a domestic abuse case against Thomas Moss, a member of the Detroit-based Phantom MC motorcycle club with ties to the Vice Lords street gang.\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit, the Vice Lords offered the victim in the case $10,000 not to testify against Moss but she refused.\n\nWith Moss' trial set to begin on Jan. 20 in front of Meyer, another Phantom MC member, Blake Smith, purchased a shotgun. A masked man traveled to the Meyers' home armed with that shotgun on Jan. 18. He lured the couple to the door by saying he was looking for his dog, shot them through the door and fled.\n\n“(Meyer) was targeted,” Indiana State Police Lt. Col. Al Williamson said at Tuesday's news conference. “They went after him for a reason.”\n\nPolice recovered the mask, the shooter's clothing and the shotgun discarded near the Meyers' home. DNA on the mask matched Raylen Ferguson, an associate of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation from Lexington, Kentucky, according to the affidavit.\n\nSurveillance video showed a car that was parked near the Meyers' home had traveled from Kentucky toward Lafayette on Jan. 16 and traveled toward Smith's residence in the hour after the shootings, according to the affidavit.\n\nMoss, Ferguson and Smith each face multiple charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Amanda Milsap, whom prosecutors allege offered the bribe in the domestic abuse case, faces bribery and obstruction counts. Zeneda Greer, a woman Ferguson lives with, has been charged with helping a criminal and obstruction. Prosecutors have accused her of traveling to Lafayette with Ferguson.\n\nMilsap's attorney, Earl McCoy, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Online court records did not list attorneys for Moss, Ferguson or Blake. Jail records indicate Greer is being held in Lexington. Online court records in that state did not list an attorney for her.",

    "description": "Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo pushed back on the narrative being advanced by FBI Director Kash Patel about Saturday's shooting in Minneapolis.",
    "fullText": "Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo pushed back on the narrative being advanced by FBI Director Kash Patel about Saturday’s shooting death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti at the hands of a border patrol agent in Minneapolis.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday Morning Futures, Patel defended the border patrol’s tactics and questioned Pretti’s motives.\n\n“Secretary [Kristi] Noem stated perfectly, you do not get to attack law enforcement officials in this country without any repercussions,” Patel said. “You do get to do that in Minnesota, L.A., or anywhere else.”\n\nPatel added, “No one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines. That is not a peaceful protest, and you do not get to touch law enforcement. You do that anywhere, this FBI is going to be following — leading the charge to arrest those.”\n\nBartiromo, though, was skeptical of Patel’s argument.\n\n“But how was he threatening Border Patrol?!” Bartiromo asked. “You’ve collected the evidence, you said, right? You have the handgun in your possession. And how was he using that handgun in terms of threatening Border Patrol? What was the threat? He had his camera, right? He was filming it.”\n\nPatel — following the pushback — grew much more cautious in his assessment.\n\n“That’s something that I let the DHS and the prosecutors — because they are the ones investigating that case, I don’t want to stylize that evidence,” Patel said. “But I trust the men and women on the ground who are trained professionals to only use it when it’s absolutely necessary. And I trust Secretary Noem’s leadership and DHS, and HSI to do the right thing, as they’ve always done in these scenarios.”\n\nBartiromo then questioned when Border Patrol agents spotted a weapon on Pretti.\n\n“Kristi Noem said that the individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun,” Bartiromo said. “Was the gun visible, or did Border Patrol see the gun after they shot him?”\n\n“Again, all those pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS and HSI, and I don’t wanna comment on their ongoing investigation,” Patel said, demurring.\n\n“I understand,” Bartiromo replied. “But you have the evidence. What can you tell us about the evidence you collected?”\n\nThe answer, it turned out, was precious little.\n\n“It’s sent to our FBI laboratory, where it’ll be finger-pristed,” Patel said. “We’ll use ballistics examination toolkits to see if any casings were fired. And we’ll examine all the casings that were found on the scene.”\n\nThe post ‘How Was He Threatening Border Patrol?!’ Fox’s Maria Bartiromo Pushes Back On FBI Director Kash Patel’s Claims About Shooting of Alex Pretti first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding, an alleged drug kingpin who's been accused of orchestrating multiple murders, was arrested in Mexico and taken to the United States, Justice Department officials announced Friday.\n\nWedding, a 44-year-old Canadian national, was taken into custody in Mexico City on Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel said at a news conference at Southern California's Ontario International Airport east of Los Angeles. During the news conference, Patel gestured to a plane behind him and told reporters Wedding had been taken off the plane.\n\nAn FBI official in Los Angeles told CBS News the U.S. government plane carrying Wedding landed at the airport from Mexico at approximately 8 a.m. local time Friday.\n\nIn a video clip provided by the FBI, a handcuffed Wedding is seen wearing jeans, sneakers, a sweatshirt, a vest and a baseball cap walking down a stairway from the plane flanked by FBI agents. Another clip shows Wedding and authorities walking away from the plane.\n\n\"Just to tell you how bad of a guy Ryan Wedding is, he went from an Olympic snowboarder to the largest narco-trafficker in modern times,\" Patel said. \"He is a modern-day 'El Chapo,' he is a modern-day Pablo Escobar, and he thought he could evade justice.\"\n\n\"El Chapo\" is an alias for Joaquin Guzman, a onetime leader of the notorious Mexican drug ring known as the Sinaloa Cartel who is serving a life sentence in the U.S. According to the FBI, Wedding also used aliases, including \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant\" and \"Public Enemy.\"\n\nPatel also said another fugitive who was arrested in Mexico last week, Alejandro Rosales Castillo, was brought to the U.S. on the same plane as Wedding and would be taken east later Friday. Patel said Castillo's arrest wasn't related to Wedding's apprehension.\n\nPatel told reporters he was in Mexico on a previously planned trip. He said the Mexican government worked with the U.S. to apprehend Wedding.\n\n\"This was a great operation that came together through interagency success,\" Patel said.\n\nPatel said he wouldn't provide additional details about Wedding's arrest \"to safeguard the integrity of the ongoing investigation.\" He declined to comment on the $15 million reward that was being offered by the U.S. for Wedding.\n\nWhen officials increased the reward in November, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi described Wedding's alleged operation as \"one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations in this world.\"\n\nThe Justice Department said it expects Wedding's arraignment to take place on Monday afternoon in Los Angeles.\n\nAkil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said investigators worked for over a year to arrest Wedding. \"Ryan Wedding tormented several people and several families that will never be the same, but today, they get the justice that they sought,\" Davis said.\n\nWedding, who competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, has been accused of running a major drug trafficking network that moved cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the U.S. and Canada. Patel said in a social media post Friday that Wedding was running his alleged operation as a member of the Sinaloa Cartel, and that Wedding was believed to have been hiding out in Mexico for over a decade.\n\nWedding was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list last year.\n\nIn November, Wedding was accused of placing a \"multimillion-dollar bounty\" on a federal witness who was involved in a narcotics case against him.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Wedding and his second-in-command Andrew Clark, 34, allegedly also ordered the killings of two members of a Canadian family in 2023 in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment.\n\nClark was extradited to the U.S. from Mexico last year.\n\nThe pair are also accused of directing the killing of another person in 2024 over a drug debt, according to the FBI.\n\nArkansas mayor on pivoting for ice storm as weather conditions worsen\n\nPennsylvania Gov.

    "fullText": "Former Canadian Olympic snowboarder and alleged drug kingpin Ryan Wedding has been arrested in Mexico and will be extradited to the US after years on the run, FBI Director Kash Patel has said.\n\nWedding, who had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, is accused of running a transnational drug trafficking operation that moved tonnes of cocaine across international borders.\n\nWedding, 44, was also wanted on murder charges. US officials had said they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.\n\nThe head of Canada's federal police force, which assisted in the investigation, spoke alongside Patel on Friday to praise the law enforcement operation.\n\n\"No single agency or nation can combat transnational organised crime alone,\" said Mike Duheme, Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\n\"We can finally say that our communities, our countries, are much safer with the arrest of Ryan Wedding,\" he added.\n\nWedding is accused of running a vast drug trafficking operation responsible for importing some 60 metric tonnes of cocaine a year.\n\nThe organisation operated across North America, as well as several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and was also the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, bringing in an estimated $1bn a year.\n\nBefore he was arrested, Wedding was accused of killing a federal witness in a case against him. Officials say he has also ordered the murders of several others.\n\nWedding is now facing a slew of felony charges, including witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking.\n\nThe FBI had previously placed a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\nUS officials have not released any information regarding how Wedding was captured, except to say that his arrest took place on Thursday night in Mexico City.\n\nThe Associated Press, citing an unnamed Mexican Security Cabinet member, reported that Wedding turned himself in at the US embassy.\n\nIn his remarks at a news conference, Patel described Wedding as a \"modern-day Pablo Escobar\", referring to the Colombian cartel leader. US officials have also compared him to Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán in Mexico.\n\n\"When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front,\" Patel said, thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation.\n\nWedding's aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI said. He has reportedly had plastic surgery to change his appearance while on the run.\n\nOfficials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.\n\nAuthorities allege he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.\n\nPatel also spoke about the recent arrest of another man in Mexico who had been on the FBI's most wanted list.\n\nAmerican man Alejandro Castillo was wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend. According to the FBI, he has been in hiding in Mexico for nearly 10 years, and will now be extradited back to North Carolina for trial.",

    "description": "The FBI served Microsoft a warrant requesting encryption recovery keys to decrypt the hard drives of people involved in an alleged fraud case in Guam.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, Forbes reported on Friday.\n\nMany modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.\n\nBut, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.\n\nThe case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.\n\nApart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that has happened several times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.\n\n“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”",

    "description": "The 44-year-old Canadian was added to the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Ryan Wedding, the former Olympic snowboarder who was wanted by the FBI for allegedly running a violent transnational drug trafficking organization, has been arrested, the Justice Department announced on Friday.\n\nWedding, 44, was added to the FBI’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list in March.\n\n“At my direction, @FBI agents have apprehended yet another member of the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted List: Ryan Wedding, the onetime Olympian snowboarder-turned alleged violent cocaine kingpin,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X.\n\nWedding was taken into custody in Mexico City on Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel at a news conference at Ontario International Airport in Southern California. He was flown to the United States from Mexico, where U.S. authorities believe he had been living for more than a decade.\n\nPatel compared Wedding to infamous drug kingpins Pablo Escobar and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.\n\n\"Just to tell you how bad of a guy Ryan Wedding is, he went from an Olympic snowboarder to the largest narco trafficker in modern times,\" Patel said. “He is a modern-day El Chapo. He is a modern-day Pablo Escobar. He thought he could evade justice.”\n\nCiting a Mexican law enforcement official, the Associated Press reported that Wedding turned himself in at the U.S. embassy. Patel would not comment on the details of his apprehension.\n\n“Ryan Wedding is now in United States custody,” Bill Essayli, assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said in a post on X. “He will face the full force of justice for his charges.”\n\nAkil Davis, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, said that Wedding would be held over the weekend and is slated to have his initial court appearance on Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a federal indictment that was unsealed in November, Wedding was charged with nine counts, including conspiracy to distribute, possess and export cocaine, conspiracy to commit murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise, witness tampering and money laundering, among other crimes.\n\nU.S. prosecutors allege that Wedding’s drug trafficking network regularly shipped hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico and Southern California to Canada and locations in the United States. Wedding was also accused of orchestrating multiple murders as part of these drug crimes.\n\nWedding, whose aliases include “El Jefe,” “Giant” and “Public Enemy,” represented his home country, Canada, during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. He competed in the parallel giant slalom and finished in 24th place.\n\n“Wedding went from shredding powder on the slopes at the Olympics to distributing powder cocaine on the streets of U.S. cities and in his native Canada,” Davis said in a statement when he was added to the most wanted list. “The alleged murders of his competitors make Wedding a very dangerous man.”\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials had said that they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the protection of the Sinaloa drug cartel.\n\nThe U.S. State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs initially offered a $10 million reward for information that could lead to Wedding’s capture. That award was raised to $15 million in November.\n\nThe same month, the Justice Department announced 10 related arrests as part of what officials dubbed “Operation Giant Slalom.” As part of the operation, Smith said that the FBI seized a Mercedes Benz worth an estimated $15 million, dozens of motorcycles, jewelry and artwork.\n\nWedding and his co-conspirators are accused of posting a photograph of a murder witness on a Canadian website called The Dirty News so he could be identified. The man was shot and killed in a restaurant in Medellín, Colombia, in January.\n\nPatel said that another fugitive on the FBI's most wanted list — Alejandro Castillo, who was captured last week in Mexico — was transported back to the United States on the same plane as Wedding. Castillo is being extradited to North Carolina, where he faces a murder charge in the 2016 death of a woman.\n\nCastillo's arrest in Mexico was unrelated to Wedding's apprehension, Patel said.",

    "description": "Forty-five current and former employees on the changes they say are undermining the agency and making America less safe.",
    "fullText": "“You need leadership that believes in the nonpartisan independence of the agency.”\n\n“I said, People in the F.B.I. will follow the facts. We were waiting and waiting for that to happen.”\n\n“We’re losing the ability for agents to conduct their work without fear or favor because the F.B.I. won’t protect you.”\n\nForty-five current and former employees on the changes they say are undermining the agency and making America less safe.\n\nWhen he returned to office last year, President Trump called the F.B.I. a “corrupt” agency in need of overhaul. He had by then been the subject of three F.B.I. investigations: Agents examined his 2016 campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, his retention of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Though all three inquiries took place in part or entirely under Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director Trump appointed, he repeatedly accused the bureau of mounting a partisan attack against him.\n\nTo replace Wray, Trump chose Kash Patel, a former public defender and intelligence official who had never worked for the F.B.I. and had spun conspiracy theories about the bureau. Since Patel’s confirmation last February, the F.B.I. has undergone a transformation that has upended its nonpartisan rules and norms, deeply rattling many of its 38,000 employees.\n\nPatel has fired agents who worked on the Trump investigations and radically changed the bureau’s mission. More than 20 percent of the F.B.I.’s work force has been assigned to immigration enforcement, pulling agents and analysts away from investigating public corruption, cybercrime, white-collar crime, drug trafficking and terrorism. Patel has also been embroiled in controversies over his use of government resources, his temperament and missteps in high-profile investigations.\n\nWe interviewed 45 employees who work at the F.B.I. or who left during Trump’s second term, as well as many other current and former government officials. Beginning with Trump’s selection of Patel, our sources narrated the events that most troubled them over the last year. Many details of what we learned are reported here for the first time.\n\nThe F.B.I. is a rule-bound and tight-lipped institution. Bureau policies prohibit active employees from speaking to the news media without authorization. Even for former employees, speaking out is a sign of serious alarm. Some of our sources shared their stories anonymously because they feared retribution from the administration. (To protect their identities, we are not indicating whether the people we quote anonymously are still employed by the F.B.I.) We corroborated their descriptions of specific events and conversations with colleagues, contemporaneous notes and internal records.\n\nPatel and other F.B.I. leaders named in this article declined our requests for interviews, and we followed up with a detailed list of questions. In response to a request for comment, Ben Williamson, an F.B.I. spokesman, wrote: “This story is a regurgitation of fake narratives, conjecture and speculation from anonymous sources who are disconnected from reality. They can whine and peddle falsehoods all they want — but it won’t change the facts that the F.B.I. under this administration worked with partners at every level and delivered a historic 2025.”\n\nWe also asked the White House for comment. “President Trump and F.B.I. Director Kash Patel are restoring integrity to the F.B.I. by returning its focus to fighting crime and letting good cops be cops,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement.\n\nMany current and former employees fear, however, that the F.B.I. has become a weapon of the White House, and that the firings and the diversion of resources to immigration enforcement have left the country vulnerable to attack.\n\nThree weeks after winning re-election, Trump named Patel as his nominee for F.B.I. director. On a podcast, Patel had promised to shut down bureau headquarters on his first day in the post and reopen it “as a museum of the deep state.”\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: I assumed Congress would see how uniquely unqualified Kash Patel was for the job. I assumed the Senate would do its due diligence and decide not to confirm him.\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: When Kash Patel was nominated, we all knew in our bones that the bureau was going to be a very different environment than any of us had experienced before. He regularly referred to us as government gangsters. He was also the author of three children’s books in which he’s a self-styled wizard who saves King Donald Trump from the evil forces of the Justice Department.\n\nMichael Bovin, former intelligence analyst: A lot of people in the F.B.I. have faith in the country and in the job. They may come from police or military families. They think they’re doing the right thing and it will all work out. And you know, there was a kernel of truth in what Patel was saying: There are too many people in headquarters. Let’s get more people back into the field.\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: I wanted the White House to succeed. For 20 years, I collected information for the president’s daily briefing. I listened to Kash Patel on a podcast, and the way he viewed Jan. 6 aligned with the F.B.I. rank and file. Agents always thought if you assaulted officers on that day, yes, absolutely, we should investigate and prosecute you. For the rest of them, it was a massive misuse of resources.\n\nBut then I heard Patel was thinking of a mass purge of the leadership and dismissing agents wholesale.\n\nThe Trump administration decided that until Patel was confirmed, the F.B.I.’s acting director would be Rob Kissane, a veteran counterterrorism agent. The acting deputy director would be Brian Driscoll, the special agent in charge of the Newark field office. But in its announcement, the White House accidentally named Driscoll to the top position. Though it was an error, Driscoll became the acting No. 1 and Kissane became the No. 2.\n\nJacqueline Maguire, former executive assistant director: The White House reversing the announcement added to this uncertain, uncomfortable feeling — it doesn’t bode well if they didn’t get that right. But I’ve known Brian and Rob a long time, and some of the other executive assistant directors did as well. We’d all grown up in the bureau, and we wanted to work together.\n\n“They said we were being fired because we could not be trusted to carry out the president’s agenda.”\n\nAt his Senate confirmation hearing, Patel was asked whether he would fire the F.B.I. agents who worked on the investigations that led to the special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of Trump. Patel responded that “no one will be terminated for case assignments.” Later in the hearing, he also promised there would be “no retributive actions” against employees.\n\nThe next day, Trump administration officials, including Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general and Trump’s former defense attorney, forced out the bureau’s top six executives, along with the heads of the F.B.I. field offices in Washington, D.C., and Miami.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: Those firings sent shock waves.\n\nSenior executive 1: It was hundreds of years of experience in one brutal swoop. It made it easier to bring their people in, yes, but there are no people to bring in with that level of experience, because it’s so specialized. You have to cut your teeth. It’s just like the military. To lead, you have to understand headquarters and the field.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: I came back to D.C. to run the office at the end of 2022 when two special counsels, Rob Hur and Jack Smith, were appointed to investigate Biden and Trump. I did not direct those cases, but it was my job to manage the agent and analyst resources for them.\n\nWe conducted factual and effective investigations into two presidents from two political parties at the same time. To do that, you need leadership that believes in the nonpartisan independence of the agency. When I was told to retire or be fired, I was frustrated that I couldn’t protect my analysts and agents from partisan interference. I wanted to be their shield.\n\nJacqueline Maguire, former executive assistant director: At the hearing, Patel made it sound like he didn’t know they were getting rid of all the top leaders. But if he really had nothing to do with it, he would have shown up and asked, Where’d everyone go? But he didn’t ask.\n\nThey said we were being fired because we could not be trusted to carry out the president’s agenda. I asked if there was any allegation of misconduct. They said no.\n\nThis was my life, my career, my identity, my calling. It was a privilege to serve the American people. To end it so quickly, it still upsets me.\n\nWhile Patel waited to be confirmed, Bove ordered the acting F.B.I. leadership to create a list of all employees assigned to Jan. 6 investigations “to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.” In response, Driscoll and Kissane sent a survey to employees asking about their roles in those cases.\n\nMaria Ricci, former assistant special agent in charge of the Washington field office: The news hit about the list and the survey, and it was mass chaos. People who worked on real sensitive cases — Jan. 6, the special-counsel investigations, the public-corruption side of the Trump investigation — were packing up their bags and assuming they were about to be fired. People were crying, taking down family pictures from their desks because they were afraid that they wouldn’t be let back in on Monday. This was at the same time that some of the people who worked on those cases were working on the plane crash in the Potomac. They were diving out there finding dead bodies and being told that they were going to be fired.\n\nNorthwest special agent: If you really dig deep down, it’s not just the case agents. Those cases involved a whole host of other people, like surveillance, negotiators, SWAT teams. It’s hard not to have touched one of those cases in some way. Maybe even more so than 9/11, because Jan. 6 was the largest investigation in the history of the bureau.\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: Emil Bove did not care that individual agents have no say in what matters they work on. You get assigned investigations. There were many agents who ended up on that list who had misgivings about how aggressively Jan. 6 was investigated. So there was a real sense that there was a sort of random persecution going on rather than actually figuring out who was making operational decisions and assigning responsibility to senior executives.\n\nBove was viewed by the F.B.I. work force not only as somebody whose integrity could not be trusted but as this almost cartoonish figure halfway between a mob enforcer and the grim reaper.\n\n(Bove did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn response to Bove’s demand, Driscoll and Kissane handed over a list of thousands of employees, identified by only their bureau ID numbers, who worked on the Jan. 6 investigations. In response, current and former F.B.I. employees sued the Justice Department, arguing that compiling the list was a violation of privacy that would endanger agents and their families. As a result of the suit, the Justice Department agreed not to release the names of the people on the list.\n\nSenior executive 3: Bove wanted some scalps; he asked for a short list of the main folks. Driscoll and Kissane decided to give them all case participants — everybody got lumped in. They were trying to protect people by flooding the zone.\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: A source called me after Jan. 6 saying they saw people they knew posting photos on social media of themselves at the Capitol. I put this in the pipeline at the time through my squad support secretary. Now she’s on the list for pressing send to get this information to the right place.\n\nField-office leader 1: The entire F.B.I. received a bizarre email from Emil Bove. The email described “insubordination” by Acting Director Driscoll and Acting Deputy Director Kissane regarding their refusal to provide names of the Jan. 6 agents. This is part of why Driscoll is a folk hero.\n\n“‘Defend the homeland’ was now on your screen when you logged in. To me, that sounded like a far-right political slogan.”\n\nThe Senate voted 51 to 49 to confirm Patel. Almost immediately, he changed the F.B.I.’s priorities. Under Wray, the bureau had eight stated goals: combating terrorism, organized crime, espionage, public corruption, white-collar crime, cybercrime and violent crime, as well as protecting civil rights. Now Patel stressed four: defend the homeland, rebuild public trust, crush violent crime and ensure fierce organizational accountability.\n\nMichael Bovin, former intelligence analyst: “Defend the homeland” was now on your screen when you logged in. To me, that sounded like a far-right political slogan that betrays the F.B.I.’s nonpartisan mission.\n\nWe also had posters on the wall of the F.B.I.’s core values. Someone pulled the diversity poster down. A photo made the rounds of them painting over “diversity” and the other values at Quantico, the F.B.I. academy.\n\nThat was very frustrating, because we spent time on this in training at Quantico. Diversity meant the F.B.I. cared about having people from all walks of life. In Hoover’s time, it was all accountants and lawyers. Now it’s not like that. One of my classmates was a manager at a major appliance company. Others came from D.C. consulting groups. And then there were the military and the police officers.\n\nPhilip Fields, former counterterrorism analyst: The first thing they did was they disbanded our Foreign Influence Task Force. They said that we had to pull back on investigations under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, which applies to people who might be working at the direction of a foreign government without disclosing it. People that I worked with in the counterintelligence program were very upset about a lot of the investigative tools being taken away.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: Shifting priorities away from cyber means less time tracing illicit cryptocurrency transactions, unmasking the identities of cybercriminals and determining their locations around the world, and disrupting nation-state adversaries who target critical infrastructure.\n\nWhen former F.B.I. Director Christopher Wray went before Congress in January 2024, he said that even if we shifted every single F.B.I. agent and analyst to working China cyber, we would be working with one person to 50 Chinese hackers or cyberthreat actors. That’s an insane statistic — and that’s just China.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: I was responsible for the morning intelligence briefing. Every director gets to choose how they want to receive information — how often and in what form. I did everything I could, leading up to Director Patel coming on board, to provide options for how those meetings would run. What type of information do you want? Do you like graphics? Do you like to read? All of that. I wanted to set him up, from Day 1, to make effective decisions.\n\nField-office leader 1: Patel had his first director’s call with the heads of all the field offices. He had no agenda, no organized thoughts, no strategy or leadership philosophy or priorities to share. I specifically remember him saying at one point, “I don’t read.” He explained he didn’t read briefing materials.\n\nSenior executive 2: There was a feeling among many in the F.B.I. that the bureau needed to change. Some believed HQ had gotten too big; metrics and bureaucracy were inhibiting investigations, and resources needed to be better aligned to the threats.\n\nBut what Kash said was basically that every process at the F.B.I. was de facto wrong and would no longer be followed. It came across as contempt for the way former directors had done business and a statement that the former structures would not apply to him.\n\nWith Patel installed, Trump named his pick for deputy director. Rather than choosing a career agent, which had been the practice for most of the F.B.I.’s history, the president selected Dan Bongino, a right-wing podcaster and former Secret Service agent who had described F.B.I. agents as “thugs for the Democrat Party” and called for disbanding the bureau.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: The deputy director oversees daily operations, so it has always been someone who knows the bureau, who has worked their way up, knows the culture, knows policy. Patel had explicitly stated to the F.B.I. Agents Association that he would appoint an in-house F.B.I. special agent, as had been the case for over 100 years.\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: When we found out that Dan Bongino was going to be the deputy director, concern reached a fever pitch. We were going to have two people who it would not be an exaggeration to say were conspiracy theorists with very little experience in federal law enforcement.\n\nSenior executive 3: Patel stopped having his weekly meetings with the leaders of the field offices on Wednesdays. There were phone calls from one individual to another, and things were getting missed, things were getting dropped, because they didn’t want to have an email chain.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: Routine internal communications stopped. The director and the deputy got frustrated with media leaks, and they wouldn’t send anything out about people retiring and new people filling their roles or reorganization of the work force. People had to go to social media to see what was going on and who might be next on the chopping block.\n\n(In response to questions about this article, Bongino wrote in an email: “A ‘media’ enterprise that viciously propagated the most destructive political hoax in American history? You guys are jokers, relying on people we likely removed for misfeasance or malfeasance, to feed your ignorant audience the nonsense gruel they crave.”)\n\nPatel directed the F.B.I., which has no immigration-enforcement authority, to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement in conducting raids and making arrests. Field offices began assigning F.B.I. agents and analysts to work immigration shifts, pulling them away from other priorities like counterterrorism, public corruption and white-collar crime.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: We’d been told that when Trump watched footage or saw a picture of a raid, he got mad that he didn’t see F.B.I. raid jackets.\n\nICE was saying they wanted their teams to commingle with our teams. Tactically, you don’t commingle units that haven’t trained together. My bosses said, If we work on immigration, we use our teams and our case info. They put together a list of people already in F.B.I. files we had concerns about, so we’re not just targeting people over their citizenship status.\n\nThey also had to juggle Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who wanted to ride in our tactical vehicle to do her TV stuff. That makes all the operators uneasy, and it makes them less safe.\n\n(The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: I had 20 years’ experience. I was involved in undercover sensitive operations. The bureau hired me for national security, to prevent threats from Al Qaeda and other groups throughout the Near East — not to sit in a parking lot arresting immigrants.\n\nMidwest case agent: I was a grunt agent. I enjoyed trying to take apart large criminal organizations piece by piece.\n\nThey relabeled task forces from drugs to immigration and pushed us toward focusing on deportation versus convictions for actual drug offenses.\n\nUnfortunately, what used to be our focus, long-term investigations, are now short-term hits. You hit the guy carrying the bag, not the guy who made the call, because that’s how you drive up the arrest and prosecution numbers. But the guy carrying the bag, you can’t flip anymore, because he’s getting deported.\n\nBecause F.B.I. agents are posting up with Homeland Security, citizens think we’re part of ICE, which disrupts other investigations. It used to be that you could sit in front of a house, watching another house, and a lot of the time, people were OK with that. They might help you. Now they’re scared.\n\nJill Fields, former supervisory intelligence analyst for violent crime in the Los Angeles field office: They decided they were going to do a big immigration push for one week at the end of February. L.A. is a major transshipment hub for drugs, and you’re going to take people off of cartel cases? They wanted three times the normal number of people in the command post on each shift. I was like, This is too much. I was told that we’ve got to do it for optics. It was to make a show for the president.\n\nI was ordered to have members of my team run a preassessment on some anti-ICE protesters who allegedly had impeded an immigration arrest. F.B.I. policy says that an investigation can’t be opened based on First Amendment-protected activity. The investigative team who analyzed the video determined that the protesters had done nothing wrong; the officers told them to stay back, and they did.\n\nI was told they had to open an investigation anyway. I pushed back, and they said, Jill, you can either get fired today, or you can get fired in four years — meaning when another administration comes in and starts looking into constitutional violations. And I was like: Then fire me today. I’m not doing something that is fundamentally wrong.\n\nI had my squad taken away from me. I was told I was a problem. I was told that the seventh floor was aware of me — the seventh floor means the F.B.I. director’s office. My squad depended on me, and now they have absolutely no top cover anymore. When they took my squad, I was done.\n\n“I was told that we’ve got to do it for optics. It was to make a show for the president.”\n\nPam Bondi, the attorney general, sent a letter to Patel accusing the F.B.I.’s New York field office of holding back thousands of pages of documents in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Hundreds of bureau employees were diverted from their regular duties to review and process more than 100,000 pages, flagging references to Trump and other well-known people as well as redacting information about victims.\n\nMichael Bovin, former intelligence analyst: We got this email about a big redaction project — all hands on deck. I thought it was the J.F.K. assassination. Nope. It’s Epstein. Our job is to go through and make sure the computer got the right stuff redacted. We’re working around the clock.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: A member of the redaction team asked me, “Can I not work on this anymore?” They’d had a team call, and Patel jumped on the call and yelled at everyone, telling them to work faster — that he’d fire everyone who worked on the redactions if he didn’t have it when he wanted it.\n\nThe F.B.I. ordered field offices to devote a third of their time to immigration enforcement. Ramping up deportations was the highest priority for Stephen Miller, one of Patel’s key allies.\n\nField-office leader 1: Kash and Dan seemed to have no control over the immigration demands being placed on the F.B.I. Emails sent to F.B.I. field leaders with immigration staffing requirements were forwarded directly from D.O.J.\n\nICE did not have the requisite data or any semblance of a strategic plan to make the F.B.I.’s efforts effective. Each F.B.I. field office was simply told to provide the designated number of F.B.I. agents to the immigration effort.\n\nI remember praying that we didn’t have a terrorist attack, mass shooting or cyberattack slip through the cracks because my agents, who were highly trained to protect against such threats, were assigned to immigration enforcement.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: When you’re taking an agent or analyst who is an expert on the Russian F.S.B. and you have them focused on name checks for immigration enforcement, what investigations are sitting because they’ve been diverted?\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: The immigration push grew immensely, and it grew fast. Leadership was like, This isn’t going away, and all of you will now participate. HQ informed our field offices that the agents out with ICE needed to be taking pictures so they could post them to social media. I had never been asked to do that during an arrest operation before. It’s inappropriate and tactically unsound.\n\nField-office leader 2: I am a conservative. I believe in tightening our borders. I just had an issue with the execution of it. My counterparts at D.H.S. were constantly getting yelled at, being threatened and fearing for their jobs. That’s not the way to work. They literally had quotas. Each region had to have a certain amount of arrests every single day. It was completely asinine.\n\nThis is how things go sideways. For me, the No. 1 priority was agent safety. I don’t want my agent to be killed or to be responsible for somebody else getting killed. I did everything I could to make sure that headquarters is happy, but at the same time, I’m not jeopardizing my agents or my morals or the Constitution either.\n\nNorthwest special agent: In Minneapolis, agents were surveilling a bunch of Somali-run autism centers because it was a kickback scheme. The centers were recruiting kids from the community, falsely diagnosing them and giving the parents a cut of the federal dollars they received for treatment. This became front-page news when the criminal indictments came down, but back in February, agents had to stop investigating for weeks to work immigration. I did not go to law school, go to Quantico and work counterterrorism operations overseas to be doing traffic control for arrest-a-brown-person day.\n\nCentral U.S. case agent: I was working an undercover operation on a neo-Nazi group with a long history of criminal activity. The F.B.I.’s niche in the federal law enforcement community is these specialized investigations, and now we’re being pulled away from those. If I’d wanted to be a cop, I would have just done that. When I resigned from the F.B.I., I was told they’d have to close the investigation — there was no one else around to pick it up.\n\nPatel traveled to Britain to attend a secret conference of the Five Eyes, the intelligence alliance formed after World War II among the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSenior executive 2: Every May, there’s a Five Eyes conference with the head of every intelligence agency. This year it was in the U.K. Kash Patel is going. In the lead-up to that, his detail starts making crazy requests. He’s got special requirements on everything. And the Brits are getting pissed.\n\nBefore the conference, his staff says he’s unhappy because he doesn’t like meetings in office settings. What he wants is social events. He wants Premier soccer games. He wants to go jet skiing. He’d like a helicopter tour. Everyone who heard about this was like: Hold on. Is he really going to ask the MI5 director to go jet skiing instead of meeting? The schedule is set, and every Five Eyes partner is doing this. They can’t just say that he’s not participating and instead he wants to go to a Premier soccer game. This is a job, guys.\n\nHis staff only cared about three things: what his meals were, when his workouts would be and what his entertainment would be. The biggest plan is how he’s going to get his girlfriend in there so she can go to Windsor Castle. He’s got Nicole Rucker as his assistant, like a true executive concierge. And when she’s not getting the food or the workout she wants, she’ll just start screaming at people, Make it happen!\n\nHis staff was briefed multiple times that the Brits were going to want to talk about an F.B.I. position in London that has been pulled. The F.B.I. is arguably their most important partner. MI5 is 5,000 people. The F.B.I. is 38,000. If MI5 ceased to exist, it would be very bad for us. If we cease to exist, it would be an existential threat for them. That person was working on a ton of sensitive stuff, including embassy penetrations and technology, and they want this position back. So Ken McCallum, the MI5 director, goes to Kash Patel at the conference and says: Hey, we really need this position. It’s so important for our mutual benefit. And Kash says: Yep, that person’s going nowhere. She’s absolutely staying. And the Brits rejoice.\n\nTwo weeks later, he reverses himself and removes her. The Brits are outraged. Kash will make promises and he will break them, and he doesn’t worry about that.\n\nOn that trip, the heads of intelligence for the Five Eyes went to Windsor Castle and met with the king. There was a photo taken of all the Five Eyes people, some of whom are nondisclosed, meaning their affiliation with the British intelligence service isn’t public. The Brits forwarded that picture as a keepsake for the individuals. They prefaced it with, This isn’t to be shared. But Kash has decided he wants to post it on social media. They have people trying to negotiate with the Brits about whether that’s possible. They’re fighting with the director’s office, like: You cannot post this. Do not do that. And they’re arguing, He wants a picture out.\n\n(The F.B.I. did not respond to questions about this trip.)\n\n“The feeling I have more is unremitting anger at the executives who have taken an oath to the Constitution and are making moral compromises on a daily basis.”\n\nMichael Feinberg, a leader of the F.B.I.’s field office in Norfolk, Va., was forced out after Bongino discovered he was friends with Peter Strzok, an agent fired in 2018 for disparaging Trump while investigating his campaign’s ties to Russia. In a text exchange, Strzok called Trump an “idiot,” and he responded to another text about Trump’s presidential run by saying, “We’ll stop it.” (In response to a request for comment, Strzok noted that the Justice Department’s inspector general found that political bias did not influence decision-making in the Russia investigation.)\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: I was at the field office working out in the gym on a Saturday, and I got a phone call from Dominique Evans, my newly appointed special agent in charge. She was on a cruise in Europe, and I was leading the office in her absence. She told me that Dan Bongino had somehow found out that I was friends with Pete Strzok. I explained to her that Pete and I had worked together in the counterintelligence division before there was any scandal associated with his name. We discovered we were into the same bands and became friends. I wasn’t breaking any policy by going to see Nick Cave and Warren Ellis with him.\n\nDominique says she’s going to get back to Bongino. When she calls me back, she says that Bongino is not satisfied with my explanation and that he’s going to talk with Patel about it. She calls me back again later, and I ask her just to be square with me. I explain I love my job, I care deeply about the organization and, personally, I have a wife in the middle of a high-risk pregnancy. What exactly is going to happen to me?\n\nAnd she says: You’re probably going to be demoted. You should expect to get polygraphed or investigated about your relationship with Pete. And I am immediately removing you as acting special agent in charge in my absence.\n\nWithin 30 seconds of hanging up with her, I knew that I was going to quit. I took an oath to the Constitution, as idealistic as that sounds, and the point of an oath is that you follow it regardless of personal consequences. I was being targeted for blatantly political reasons. I don’t want to sound like a boy scout, but we have to be an apolitical organization that does things by the book. We have the power to deprive people of their freedom. And in some circumstances, we have the power to deprive people of their lives.\n\n(An F.B.I. spokesman said employees have been forced out only for behaving unethically or failing to deliver on the agency’s mission. He declined to comment on specific firings, including Feinberg’s.)\n\nTo be hired by the bureau and receive a security clearance, most F.B.I. personnel must pass a polygraph test, during which they are asked about foreign contacts, drug use and serious criminal conduct. The bureau also administers polygraphs to agents working on highly classified investigations and to agents accused of misconduct. The New York Times revealed that Patel was ramping up the F.B.I.’s use of polygraphs to crack down on media leaks and ensure loyalty to him personally. One question frequently asked was whether employees had said anything negative about the director.\n\nSenior leader for counterintelligence: I worked counterintelligence and espionage cases my entire career. The polygraph is voodoo science. The bureau doesn’t predicate cases on a polygraph — it’s just an indicator. People fail a poly for lots of reasons. It puts somebody in the position of being very nervous. It’s purposely stressful.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: They were polygraphing their own senior leadership team because they were so mad about media leaks. Each assistant director, as head of division, had to identify two people in our division to polygraph. Many of us volunteered ourselves and then asked one of our deputies so we wouldn’t have to put it on our people.\n\nDawn E. Morrow, former senior human-resources manager: One of my employees got polygraphed for being in a meeting where apparently something was leaked. The way they were being used when I left was as a weapon, almost a punishment.\n\nA gunman opened fire outside CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Mich. He shot and wounded one person before being killed by the church’s security staff.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: ​​Bongino called the field office in Detroit. In the normal course of business, if the deputy director calls at a moment like that, they’re asking: How can we help? What do you need? They can turn on all the resources of the organization. But Bongino called and asked, What can I tweet about this?\n\nThe field office has to be careful — this is their boss. But the body was still there. They said, We’ll get back to you. But Bongino kept calling back, asking, What can I tweet?\n\n(Bongino declined to respond to questions about this specific event and others.)\n\nTonya Ugoretz, the head of intelligence at the F.B.I., was removed from her position.\n\nHer dismissal came after Senator Chuck Grassley — an Iowa Republican and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which conducts oversight of the intelligence agencies — requested information from the F.B.I. about a years-old intelligence report. The report contained a secondhand tip that the Chinese government was creating fake IDs to cast votes for Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe F.B.I. provided Grassley with emails from agents debating the report, which was ultimately withdrawn amid doubts about its credibility. In one email, an F.B.I. employee wrongly identified Ugoretz as the official who ordered the withdrawal.\n\nIn another email, an analyst expressed concern that the report might have been suppressed for political reasons. Marshall Yates, the head of the F.B.I.’s office of congressional affairs, who provided the emails, wrote to Grassley endorsing the idea that the report was suppressed.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: For whatever reason, my name was mentioned as one of two officials who told the Albany field office, which issued that report, to recall it. It wasn’t true. I was in the cyber division then, so it wouldn’t have been my role. When I found out, I spoke to my supervisor. We met with Bongino that day. I was told it was out of his hands. I wasn’t sure what that meant.\n\nThe next afternoon, I was placed on administrative leave. I was told that was because the F.B.I. didn’t want to have to explain to Grassley’s office why the person named in the emails was the current head of intelligence.\n\nI heard that other F.B.I. leaders were stunned and asking for some kind of due process. Our inspection division contacted me and said they were going to conduct a strategic review — an internal investigation of the Albany field report and whether senior leadership, above me at the highest levels, directed this intelligence to be buried. I was interviewed twice for that and polygraphed.\n\nIn October, I got a call to discuss my options. I had to ask — What did the review show? The official I met with said he hadn’t read it, but his understanding was the review found no misconduct by me or related to the recall of the report.\n\nI asked, If the review found I did nothing wrong, why can’t I return to my position? I was given the standard line: It’s at the director’s discretion to reassign senior executives, which is true. The only options I was given were demotions. I decided to leave.\n\nI’m just one person in a series of senior officials who were disappeared. I can’t think of a better word for it. Heads of field offices would be there one day and gone the next.\n\nI’m a firm believer in the oversight function of Congress. Conducting intelligence missions in a democracy, as the F.B.I. does, requires oversight and accountability. ​​It’s hard to say that providing materials to Congress is bad. But in my case, sharing the documents without having done any work to explain whether an allegation was true or false — how does that help Congress in its oversight mission?\n\nWhat it does do is create fear among the work force. They lose the trust in their own agency to have their back.\n\n“They were polygraphing their own senior leadership team because they were so mad about media leaks.”\n\nPatel fired Brian Driscoll, the former acting director who had been leading the crisis-response group after Patel’s confirmation, and Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office. Evans had been brought to Patel’s attention by Kyle Seraphin, a podcaster and former F.B.I. agent who was suspended by the bureau in 2022.\n\n“He’s fucked.” (Driscoll and Evans have alleged wrongful termination in a pending lawsuit against the F.B.I.)\n\nPublic-corruption agent: Seraphin and other agents who have been suspended are out there on social media with the credibility of being former F.B.I. agents. If you can say, I’m the victim because of this guy Spencer Evans, and then he gets fired, it increases your credibility. People see that and think, Maybe they’re correct, and the whole system is corrupt — even if most of it is nonsense.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: The downside of having folks scared about losing their jobs is that you go from being an organization where people come in and do the work to spending time keeping their head down or on LinkedIn looking for jobs.\n\nI want to sound the alarm about how this affects Americans’ safety. I’ve seen it up close, where we have stopped stuff Americans will never know about. The F.B.I. doesn’t do a good job, in my opinion, of highlighting the number of things it stops. There’s a concern about scaring people; you don’t want to make people feel under dire threat all the time. But thousands of attacks stopped over a few years is normal. That depends, though, on people doing the work.\n\n“I assumed Congress would see how uniquely unqualified Kash Patel was for the job.”\n\nPatel fired Walter Giardina, an agent from the elite public-corruption squad in Washington known as CR-15 that ran Arctic Frost, the investigation into Trump for interference in the 2020 election.\n\nTwo months earlier, Grassley had sent Patel and Bondi a letter containing misconduct allegations against Giardina made by unnamed whistle-blowers. They included a claim that Giardina had corroborated the Steele dossier, a set of later-discredited memos about Trump’s ties to Russia in 2016.\n\nGrassley named Giardina in the letter despite the bureau’s standard practice of protecting case agents by asking Congress to redact their names from sensitive disclosures. (Clare Slattery, a spokeswoman for Grassley, said in a statement that it is his “longstanding office policy to leave names unredacted in public document productions” because “Americans deserve to know how their tax dollars are being spent.”)\n\nGiardina tried to meet with Yates, the head of the office of congressional affairs, to contest the allegations and explain that he never had access to the Steele dossier.\n\nWalter Giardina, former CR-15 agent: ​​I took a lot of pride in being trusted with difficult assignments. Until this year, public corruption was the No. 1 criminal priority of the F.B.I. The people you’re going after may be powerful, and they can come after you in asymmetric ways.\n\nWhen Senator Grassley wrote a letter naming me to the director as the person behind the Steele dossier, that was punching all the way down. I don’t know of any other time that a senator wrote a letter attacking an individual street-level agent. I’m begging my managers and the office of congressional affairs to meet with me to sort out this situation — for me personally, but also for the F.B.I. as a whole. It would take one second to look at the case access history and see that I never even had access to the Steele matter. I had nothing to do with that.\n\nMy wife was in and out of the hospital from June 5 to July 15, when she passed away. During that time, I kept trying to meet with the office of congressional affairs about responding to Grassley’s letter. On June 19, we had a meeting set at the Hoover Building. My wife had just started a new chemo medication. She had a terrible adverse reaction, and I said I was having family health concerns and asked to do the meeting via Teams, which would be pretty normal. They immediately canceled it. When I asked why, the answer was that Marshall Yates wanted to do the meeting not as an interview but as a mock hearing.\n\nI didn’t know my wife was about to pass away. I reserved a conference room at the hospital to meet the office of congressional affairs next to her room, so they could interview me. They didn’t show up. She died the next day.\n\nAt my insistence, I was finally interviewed two days after her funeral. I said: I don’t want anyone to tell me it’s too soon. I won’t be emotional. I want to get this over with. I knew the interview was messed up because Marshall Yates wasn’t present. I had a prepared statement with all the facts. I gave it to them. They didn’t ask any questions. I sent all the records they asked for. Then it was over. They’d already decided to fire me, so no one was taking the interview seriously except me.\n\nIn CR-15, we worked the cases we were assigned. It was not my idea to open Arctic Frost. We were detailed to Jack Smith. The supervisors came to us and said, You’re going to do this. We’re losing the ability for agents to conduct their work without fear or favor because the F.B.I. won’t protect you.\n\nMaria Ricci, former assistant special agent in charge of the Washington field office: Walter was one of the most heartbreaking ones, because it was the week after he buried his wife. She had cancer, and then he gets hit with this. I was at a happy hour at the Irish Channel, sitting outside with some other agents. And it was like: Oh, my god. How do we support him? How do we get food to him? Because he’s on his own with three kids.\n\nBlaire Toleman, former supervisory special agent for CR-15: My team always did the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons. But the F.B.I. fired some of them for no reason, with no internal investigation we knew of. To fire my colleagues like that was shocking. I thought, Shouldn’t it just be me, not the people I assigned to work on a case? I had huge grief about them.\n\nWe all worked in an agency where the truth was paramount. I said, People in the F.B.I. will follow the facts. We were waiting and waiting for that to happen.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: CR-15 is a storied squad. Walter and Blaire, like others, were chosen for the squad because they were exceptionally talented and experienced investigators. They could not tell you the breakdown of the political affiliations of the subjects they investigated. They were two of the best agents I’ve ever worked with, and I’ve worked with a lot of great ones.\n\nThe F.B.I. is accountable for what it accomplishes or fails to accomplish as an agency. We don’t attach responsibility to individual case agents, who don’t even get to choose what cases they’re working.\n\nCharlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a university in Utah. Hours later, Patel told his 1.8 million followers on X that a suspect had been detained, only to backtrack shortly afterward. Patel then flew to Utah to personally oversee the investigation.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: I’ve run so many command posts for major attacks. You don’t know in the initial aftermath what’s going on, but you should be able to say to bosses, “We think there are five suspects,” or “We think it’s this one person,” and know that the information won’t leave that conference room. Because it could be wrong. Often, in the beginning, it is wrong.\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: Now social media dominates and controls the perception of what we should be doing. It’s incredibly hard — whether you’re an operational support technician or a special agent or op assistant director — not to let it get to you. It’s all we’re hearing.\n\nSenior leader for counterintelligence: When he landed in Salt Lake City, Patel didn’t have a raid jacket and reportedly ordered people to go find him one. He needed a size medium. They found him a female’s jacket that didn’t have the patches that he wanted, so he had the SWAT team taking their patches off to put on his jacket before he would go to the press conference. I haven’t worn my raid jacket since Quantico, in 20 years of my career. You just don’t wear it, especially in a leadership position.\n\nSenior executive 2: Whenever there’s a critical incident, one of the first things that happens is a conference call with everybody — all the executives, most of the field offices dial in. The director rarely speaks, because someone with situational awareness is leading the call. They’ll say: Here’s what happened. Here’s what we know. Here’s what we need. But we get on, and it’s just Kash berating the special agent in charge in Salt Lake. He’s super emotional.\n\nAnd then it turns surreal. He and Bongino start talking about their Twitter strategy. And Kash is like: I’m gonna tweet this. Salt Lake, you tweet that. Dan, you come in with this. Then I’ll come back with this. They’re literally scripting out their social media, not talking about how we’re going to respond or resources or the situation. He’s screaming that he wants to put stuff out, but it’s not even vetted yet. It’s not even accurate.\n\nWhen I was an agent, I did hundreds of these cases. The initial information that comes in is always wrong. There’s too much coming in, and it takes time to vet. And it was obvious that Kash can’t understand that and doesn’t want to understand that.\n\nEveryone on the call is just like: This guy is completely out of control. On another call, he said: When a crisis happens, the only thing you need to do is call me. The most important thing in any crisis is controlling the narrative. I was like: No, no, no. We actually have to do some work here. We’re going to have to investigate, to solve this.\n\nIn a congressional hearing, Patel was questioned about his and Bongino’s decision to change the bureau’s fitness test for new agents, replacing situps with pull-ups. Senator Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, pointed out that the increased emphasis on upper-body strength could make the test disproportionately harder for women because of differences in physiology. Patel replied that the new test was appropriate for agents in the field who “have to chase down bad guys and do really hard work.” The F.B.I. went forward with adding pull-ups to the test, scoring men and women differently.\n\nSenior executive 3: Bongino wanted to establish a new physical-fitness test without any evidence-based research. He wanted to have men and women do the exact same pull-ups, which all of the data said would lead to losing a number of female recruits and potentially female agents that hadn’t been tested for pull-ups before.\n\nWhen he was informed of that, Bongino said, You can have the best female agent take down the biggest case in our history, but if on the Ring door-camera video she’s out of shape or overweight, that’s going to be the story. He was worried about whether or not they’d look good on a doorbell camera. He said it’s the way these times are.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: I score really high on the physical-fitness test. I coached sports. I can do pull-ups when I train for them. But there was still a feeling of diminished value. The test should actually be reflective of our daily duties.\n\n“Our motto is ‘Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity.’ I hope and pray one day they will have upper leadership that embodies that.”\n\nThe F.B.I. fired a group of agents who were photographed kneeling during a Black Lives Matter protest in the summer of 2020. A dozen of those agents later sued the F.B.I. for wrongful termination, claiming that the crowd had backed them against a wall and was throwing objects. They knelt, they said, “to defuse a volatile situation, not as an expressive political act.”\n\nMaria Ricci, former assistant special agent in charge of the Washington field office: Three of the people in that picture had worked for me. We’re not cops, despite what Kash Patel says. We’re investigators. We gather evidence and build cases. That summer, we were put on the street to handle riots. And we were never, ever trained to do that. Cops have batons. They have pepper spray. They have all sorts of other tools for crowd control. What we have are our voices and our guns. These agents were surrounded and made a decision to de-escalate the situation. And that was, in my opinion, the right choice.\n\nSenior leader for counterintelligence: The firings were a reaction to people online calling them Kneel Team Six. That incident was investigated by F.B.I. leadership, and the agents were cleared. Then Kash Patel comes in and reopens the whole thing. They were cleared again, but Patel fired them anyway.\n\nPatel dismissed David Maltinsky, an F.B.I. agent in training, who had displayed a Pride flag at his desk when he worked for the bureau as a tactical specialist in Los Angeles. Maltinsky was three weeks from his graduation at Quantico.\n\nDavid Maltinsky, former tactical specialist and agent trainee: My aunt and uncle are in law enforcement — my aunt is a retired special agent — and I aspired to carry out that same mission. So when I applied and was accepted at Quantico, I was accomplishing my life’s goal.\n\nI was in the dorms with my squad when I heard that my supervisor needed to talk to me. She and I were led into a conference room. Then the executives walked in and sat down. One of them said, David, there’s no other way to say this, but you are being terminated effective today. He handed me a letter that said I had “exercised poor judgment with an inappropriate display of political signage” in my work station in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2021, the F.B.I. approved Pride flags to fly in front of federal buildings. At the end of Pride month that year, the flag that had flown outside the L.A. field office was given to me by bureau leaders to maintain. Other gay F.B.I. employees texted me to say how incredible it was to see it up there. It wasn’t that long ago that being gay meant you couldn’t get a security clearance — you couldn’t have a job at the F.B.I. It was 1993 before you could serve openly.\n\nReading the letter, I was thinking this may be connected to a complaint that my supervisor got after the inauguration. An employee who worked on another floor claimed the flag was now in violation of President Trump’s executive order banning D.E.I. The flag had been on my desk for years at that point. My supervisor reassured me that it didn’t violate anything in his view. He said: Keep it up. You don’t need to take it down. But somehow word of the Pride flag reached Kash Patel.\n\nOne of the executives asked me where I was going to go that night, and I told him I had nowhere to go. It was so quiet in that room. You could see in their faces that they thought this was awful. They said, You could stay another night if you need to plan and pack. I appreciated that, but if the directive was for me to leave, I’m going to leave.\n\nGrassley released documents showing that F.B.I. agents working on Arctic Frost subpoenaed the Jan. 6 call logs of nine Republican members of Congress. The logs did not include the content of the conversations, but Grassley said that the subpoenas amounted to spying and that Arctic Frost was “arguably worse than Watergate.”\n\nPatel then fired two more agents who worked on Arctic Frost. He also shut down the CR-15 public-corruption squad. “You’re darn right I fired those agents,” Patel said that night on Fox News. “You’re darn right I blew up CR-15.”\n\nPublic-corruption agent: “Vendetta” is the best word for what they’re doing. I’ve tried to figure out where the vitriol comes from. I think it’s partisanship.\n\nFrom a basic investigative standpoint, if you’re looking into a possible conspiracy and you want to know who that person might have reached out to on a particular date or time, then seeking subpoenas for call records is a reasonable and logical step. We’re talking only about the in-and-out numbers and the date, time and length of the calls. Obtaining that information is such a basic tenet of an investigation. And sometimes you get it and you find out it means absolutely nothing. It helps you rule something out.\n\nJacqueline Maguire, former executive assistant director: There are rules surrounding grand-jury material to protect the integrity of an investigation as well as people’s privacy and civil liberties. These proceedings are normally kept secret. Documents in a case file are part of a pending investigation, and more action is needed to corroborate the evidence. It’s problematic to release this material without context.\n\nPatel flew on an F.B.I. jet to a wrestling event in Pennsylvania, where his girlfriend, the country singer Alexis Wilkins, was performing the national anthem. The pair then took the plane to Nashville, where Wilkins lives. That weekend, Patel again used the jet for personal travel, this time for a trip to Boondoggle Ranch, a hunting resort in Texas that is owned by a major Republican donor.\n\nKyle Seraphin, the former agent and podcaster who previously supported Patel, posted some of the flight records on X and criticized him for flying at taxpayer expense during a government shutdown. Patel reportedly blamed Steven Palmer, an agent who oversaw the bureau’s aviation assets, for the bad publicity and fired him.\n\nField-office leader 2: There’s a $545 million budget cut for the bureau. Meanwhile, you’re spending millions of dollars just gallivanting. How do you justify that?\n\nSenior executive 2: Whenever the girlfriend is going to sing the national anthem at some wrestling event or some National Rifle Association or Turning Point event, they’re calling the local SWAT team, saying, You’re going to guard her. Meanwhile, in Nashville, those poor bastards — their SWAT team has actually been converted to her protection. They’re not even doing their own SWAT arrests anymore. They’ve got to bring in other teams to do that, because they’re guarding her all the time.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: This is among the reasons William Sessions lost his job when he was F.B.I. director — for allegedly misusing government planes and having agents run errands for his wife. That was the 1990s. Since then, having a SWAT team protect an F.B.I. director’s family member or girlfriend — to my knowledge, that didn’t happen when the director wasn’t present. And I spent more than half my career in tactical positions, including three years in which I had programmatic control of every F.B.I. SWAT team.\n\nPatel fired four more agents who worked on Arctic Frost after Grassley released documents from whistle-blowers naming them.\n\nCoordination between Grassley and the F.B.I.’s office of congressional affairs was unusually close throughout the year. Marshall Yates, the head of the O.C.A., and his team combed through the F.B.I.’s files to identify agents they thought were biased, according to congressional aides. Former law-enforcement officials believe these agents are among those whose names Grassley is making public, bypassing the F.B.I.’s protections for employees. (A Grassley spokeswoman said his disclosures followed the rules and were thoroughly vetted over months or years.)\n\nYates and Rosemaria Marketos, a former CR-15 agent working with him, were also members of the Weaponization Working Group, a task force created by Bondi to address “abuses of the criminal-justice process” during the Biden administration.\n\nChristopher O’Leary, former senior executive in the counterterrorism division: The irony of the name “weaponization group” is rich. They are doing what they said the Biden administration did. If the weaponization group and the office of congressional affairs have merged at a certain level, that is very problematic for two reasons. First, this merger abandons the F.B.I.’s history of being unbiased. Second, O.C.A. becomes another bullhorn for this administration’s political narrative. The people paying the price are the public servants in the F.B.I. and D.O.J., and more broadly, the American people.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: It’s concerning to me that senior officials are saying agents from the Department of Homeland Security need to wear masks to avoid being doxxed, while the names of F.B.I. agents are being read aloud in Congress, which can lead to the same risks. I’ve not seen a public defense of these agents, which may be the unfortunate result of the removal of so much of the F.B.I.’s senior leadership.\n\nIn a final blow to CR-15, Patel fired Blaire Toleman, who was in charge of the squad when it investigated Trump.\n\nBlaire Toleman, former supervisory special agent for CR-15: In my years of service, I never so much as got a stern talking-to. I got a call saying I’d receive a letter by the end of the day that I was no longer employed with the F.B.I. I was at a training. I asked if I had to drive to the office to turn my stuff in. Yes, I did. My squad helped me pack up my office. My wife picked me up. Quite a few people, around 40, walked me out.\n\nOn the way home, I got a call that I might not be getting fired. Then I got another call two hours later: You’re definitely not fired. Then the next day, I got fired again. My letter of termination said I was being fired due to my lack of judgment, leading to the weaponization of the government. In reality, they were firing us because they didn’t like the case we worked.\n\nA lot of people in the bureau are pissed about what’s happening, but they will step up to try to make sure the American people remain safe, because that’s our job. When I was getting walked out, I told my squad and the other people with me: Keep your heads up. Don’t let the American people suffer.\n\nIn a leaked memo, Bondi tasked the F.B.I. with compiling a list of “domestic terrorism organizations” in response to a presidential memorandum in September that ordered federal law enforcement to prioritize domestic threats, particularly antifa.\n\n“Common threads animating this violent conduct,” the presidential memorandum stated, “include anti-Americanism, anticapitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States government; extremism on migration, race and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion and morality.”\n\nAt a congressional hearing in September, Patel testified that the bureau had increased the number of domestic terror investigations opened that year by 300 percent.\n\nPhilip Fields, former counterterrorism analyst: Antifa is not an organization. It is a loosely formulated ideology. Designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization blurs the lines between investigating national-security threats and First Amendment-protected activity. The broadness of the language suggests that the lines could get blurred between left-wing extremist groups and advocacy groups for left-aligned policies.\n\nNational-security intelligence analyst: The bureau is still dealing with the reputation it acquired under Hoover, when he oversaw a vast domestic surveillance network and the F.B.I. maintained dossiers on huge numbers of people not suspected of crimes. The malfeasance of the ’60s and ’70s is really drilled into us at Quantico. I think a lot of people reading Bondi’s memo very reasonably interpreted it as meaning they want a return to Hoover. I know that across the institution, people are very uncomfortable with that language.\n\n“People that I worked with in the counterintelligence program were very upset about a lot of the investigative tools being taken away.”\n\nAs the Trump administration approached its one-year mark, Patel promoted the bureau’s success in fighting crime under his leadership. On X, he claimed a “100% increase” in year-to-year arrests and a “210% increase” in the disruption of gangs and criminal enterprises. “This FBI is saving lives,” he wrote, “protecting innocent kids, and taking deadly drugs off our streets at levels not seen in decades.”\n\nSenior executive 3: The F.B.I. is bilking their numbers. F.B.I. agents are walking around providing support for local police and ICE. If the local police or ICE makes an arrest, the F.B.I. is counting it in their stats. One example I heard: An F.B.I. agent was walking around with a couple cops who arrested someone for shoplifting, and the F.B.I. claimed it as an arrest. It used to be that the main thing that we would capture in our own arrest stats was if the F.B.I. was the lead agency and it was a federal charge. It hurts me to say it, but they’re bullshit numbers.\n\nCentral U.S. case agent: Let’s say the Highway Patrol pulls somebody over. There’s a gun in the car. Well, then all of a sudden an F.B.I. car shows up, a D.E.A. car shows up, an A.T.F. car shows up. They run the gun and see if it’s stolen. They run the person and see if he’s a felon. Oh, he’s a felon? OK, great. Now the F.B.I. and the A.T.F. and the D.E.A. are all going to say that they got an arrest because they showed up just to balloon the numbers.\n\nField Office Leader 1: When you make F.B.I. agents street cops, you get street-cop numbers. We didn’t used to count immigration arrests, because we didn’t do immigration. Now we do. We didn’t do street patrols in D.C. in the past. Now we do.\n\nIn the past, we mostly worked the complex investigations the F.B.I. is famous for. Complicated work with wires and sophisticated techniques — all aimed at taking out the entire criminal enterprises or national security threats. Now, under Kash, we are counting stuff that has been historically left to local police departments and other agencies and saying, Wow, look at us.\n\n(An F.B.I. spokesman disputed these accounts. “The FBI ONLY counts state arrests when we work cases jointly from partners,” he wrote. “Since becoming director, Patel’s focus has been on partner engagements and joint operations, we do it together.”)\n\nIn the days after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis, the Trump administration blocked state and local officials from reviewing the evidence. Justice Department officials, including Patel, steered the F.B.I. away from a civil rights investigation into whether the ICE agent used excessive force. Instead, Patel ordered an investigation into local activist groups and Good’s wife. Six federal prosecutors resigned in protest. The Justice Department also began criminally investigating Democratic officials in the state, including Governor Tim Walz and the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: The F.B.I. has closed and cleared civil rights investigations without officers being charged when there’s no evidence to substantiate a charge. The way to ascertain the truth is to conduct a fair and impartial investigation. But when government officials communicate on social media about their perception of the events, and many agents have been fired over the outcome of cases they worked, that could have negative impact on this investigation.\n\nJill Fields, former supervisory intelligence analyst for violent crime in the Los Angeles field office: I’ve seen multiple videos of protesters being arrested who aren’t impeding immigration enforcement. Yes, they’re yelling, they’re taunting, but that’s their right. This is what I was worried about and why I pushed back when the L.A. office was asked to investigate protesters last year. It was unthinkable to me then, and now it’s happening. If you start arresting or investigating people for exercising their First Amendment rights, then they don’t have those rights.\n\nThe F.B.I. will literally open an investigation into a bureau car accident, so the idea that they haven’t opened a civil rights investigation after an agent-involved shooting — that’s shocking.\n\nChristopher Raia, a career agent who was previously in charge of the New York field office, was named to replace Bongino, who stepped down in December. Raia shares the role of deputy director with Andrew Bailey, a former Missouri attorney general who moved to the F.B.I. in September. Later, Raia posted on X: “I know the FBI will continue to accomplish great things in the year ahead.”\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: ​​What I feel is not just disappointment at the way Patel and Bongino have changed the bureau. The feeling I have more is unremitting anger at the executives who have taken an oath to the Constitution and are making moral compromises on a daily basis to advance their careers. I know some of them are undoubtedly thinking that we need to make some compromises in order to save the F.B.I. as an institution. But the F.B.I. doesn’t matter because it exists as a building on Pennsylvania Avenue. The F.B.I. matters because of the ideals and principles it is supposed to uphold. And if the building continues to exist but those principles and ideals are thrown aside, the victory in saving the F.B.I. has been completely Pyrrhic.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: I resigned when it became clear to me that F.B.I. leadership was undermining the bureau’s mission and pursuit of justice. But I don’t expect anyone to make the same decision that I did. I have the most profound respect for my colleagues that are still there. Our motto is “Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity.” I hope and pray one day they will have upper leadership that embodies that.\n\nSenior executive 1: I was one of the F.B.I.’s top recruiters. I can’t do that right now. I just got a message from someone I’d talked to about applying, saying, Wow, I got an interview. I had to say, I can no longer recommend that you go work for the F.B.I.\n\nThis isn’t my F.B.I. I don’t recognize this F.B.I.",
