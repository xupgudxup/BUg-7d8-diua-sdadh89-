    "fullText": "A union with 1.8 million members is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Apollo Global Management's past statements about Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn a letter to the SEC's head of enforcement on Tuesday, the American Federation of Teachers accused the asset manager of making \"misleading\" claims about its exposure to the convicted sex offender.\n\nThe letter says that Apollo previously suggested that its Epstein risk was largely limited to cofounder Leon Black, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 — after a law firm hired by Apollo found that Black paid Epstein millions over the years for financial advice.\n\nThe letter went on to say that the Justice Department's latest release of Epstein files suggests the firm provided an \"inaccurate and incomplete picture of the firm and its partners' connections to Epstein.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Apollo CEO Marc Rowan stood by the firm's 2021 disclosure to investors, saying that no one other than Black \"had either a business or personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\n\"There is nothing new here,\" the statement said. \"While Mr. Epstein sought to do work with the Apollo cofounders other than Mr. Black, it was declined at every turn.\"\n\nThe AFT, whose members have billions in pension money invested with Apollo, cited communications between cofounders Rowan and a third cofounder, Josh Harris, released by the DOJ on January 30. It noted communications between Rowan and Epstein spanned from 2013 to 2016, including a 2016 email showing Rowan and Epstein discussing \"Apollo calculations for a tax receivable agreement.\"\n\n\"As the Epstein files make clear, Apollo partners Rowan and Harris appear to have consulted with Epstein on numerous personal and professional matters,\" the letter said.\n\n\"Clearly, there is material risk in this association with Apollo's business, and its investors deserve to be accurately informed about that matter,\" said the letter to the SEC's Margaret Ryan.",

    "description": "Following his best game of the season, Dailyn Swain is adding to his trophy case. The transfer from Xavier was named the SEC Co-Player of the Week.",
    "fullText": "During his first season as a Texas Longhorn, Dailyn Swain has arguably been the team's most important player. Since the season opener, he has been a scoring machine for Sean Miller as Texas has inched closer to a March Madness berth. On Monday, the talented junior added to his trophy case when he was named the SEC Men's Basketball Co-Player of the Week.\n\nIn the Longhorns' latest win over Missouri on Saturday, Swain recorded a game-high 25 points and two steals in 37 minutes of action. He also added six rebounds and two assists to his resume. Regardless of where he was on the court, Swain was dangerous with the ball in his hands, going 3-6 from three-point range.\n\nTexas star Dailyn Swain has been named the SEC Co-Player of the Week, the conference announced. \n\nShares the honor with Florida guard Xaivian Lee.\n\nSwain posted 25 points, 6 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in Saturday's win vs. Missouri.#HookEm pic.twitter.com/tO7puhEhKU\n\n— Zach Dimmitt (@ZachDimmitt7) February 16, 2026\n\nFor Swain, Monday's honor was the latest in an unforgettable 2025-2026 campaign. Earlier this month, the Columbus native was named to the Midseason Watch List for the Julius Erving Small Forward of the Year Award. He currently leads the Longhorns in points per game with 17.6, rebounds per game with 7.3, and assists with 85.\n\nWith four games left in the regular season, Swain has playing his best basketball of the season at the perfect time. He has scored at least 18 points in six of his last seven games. That included a 26-point effort against Georgia who is ranked as the 21st best team in the country. For a team with national championship aspirations, that was a major win.\n\nDailyn Swain ices the game for Texas. \n\nThe Longhorns have won four straight and are 7-5 in the SEC. Big road win for Texas' NCAA Tournament chances.pic.twitter.com/cc8YIU4eLt\n\n— Zach Dimmitt (@ZachDimmitt7) February 15, 2026\n\nAdditionally, Swain has taken his game to another level in conference play. Against SEC teams, the Africentric Early College alum is averaging 20.4 points and 7.8 rebounds per game. That has helped the Longhorns hold their own against some of the best teams in the country.\n\nAs long as Swain continues his recent play, more accolades could be heading his way. His play against Missouri was just one of many examples of why he has become a fan favorite in the Forty Acres.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Longhorns Wire: Dailyn Swain wins SEC honors after Longhorns basketball streak",

    "fullText": "Michigan football has found its replacement for Lou Esposito.\n\nThe Wolverines are expected to hire Vanderbilt defensive line coach Larry Black as the school’s new defensive tackles coach, two people with knowledge of the situation but not permitted to speak publicly on the decision since it's not yet official, confirmed to the Free Press.\n\nThe hiring was first reported by ESPN's Pete Thamel.\n\nBlack, 36, served as Vanderbilt's defensive line coach for the past four seasons, with the addition of run defense coordinator duties in 2025. He was recently promoted to co-defensive coordinator heading into the 2026 season.\n\nTHE SCANDAL: Connor Stalions NCAA penalty: Appeal of 8-year ban shot down\n\nBlack played at Indiana (2009-13), where he finished with 127 tackles in 48 games. He has some Midwest ties as a coach, too, having served as both a graduate assistant and assistant defensive line coach at Notre Dame (2016-18) and then as defensive line coach for for Toledo from 2019-21.\n\nWhile much of Vanderbilt's improvement the past two seasons came on offense, there was a notable step forward on defense, too, with the Commodores' run defense going from 104th nationally in 2023 to 18th in 2025, allowing just 108.2 yards per game last season. Likewise, the Commordores' per-game sack average jumped from 1.75 (101st nationally) in 2023 to 2.39 (36th) in 2025.\n\nHe replaces Esposito, who departed for the Baltimore Ravens' defensive line job under former U-M DC Jesse Minter, now the coach in Baltimore. Esposito spent two seasons in Ann Arbor after his hiring from Memphis, producing several NFL players (including first-round NFL draft picks Mason Graham, Kenneth Grant and third-round pick Josaiah Stewart).\n\nBlack will work with edge coach Lewis Powell, who joined U-M's staff after having worked for new coach Kyle Whittingham in Utah.\n\nTony Garcia is the Wolverines beat writer for the Detroit Free Press.

    "description": "The Texas Longhorns evened up their SEC record at 5-5 with a win over South Carolina but their slow starts are still a problem area that Sean Miller must fix.",
    "fullText": "The 2025-26 Texas men's basketball team will never make it look easy.\n\nMost every game is a scrap, opponent's record be damned.\n\nAnd so it went Tuesday against South Carolina at sleepy Moody Center.\n\nThe Longhorns are smart enough to realize they can’t look past anybody, yet they were locked in the middle of a cockfight at crunch time against a team with nothing to lose. SC, now 2-8 in SEC play, isn’t a good team but a visitor from another planet would not have been able to pick which team was favored by 13 points at certain points.\n\nMORE CED: Why Texas baseball's Schlossnagle sought roster depth in the offseason\n\nThe 84-75 win had to happen at this point in the season lest the Horns were about to start wondering if they would accept the predictable NIT invitation in a couple of months.\n\n  It's called Ced’s Corner, from the mind of the American-Statesman’s resident sports columnist, the 2025 NSMA Texas Sportswriter of the Year.\n\nAs it turns out, they shook off a comatose start in front of a late-arriving crowd for the early tipoff — the student section at Moody was noticeably thin — survived 35 points from South Carolina guard Meechie Johnson and blistered the Gamecocks with 49 second-half points to win a game much closer than the final score indicated.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, the Horns, after an 0-2 start in conference play, are firmly in the NCAA Tournament mix. They’re 13-9 overall and 5-5 in the league which puts them only one win from matching last season’s conference total, though it’s obvious the SEC isn’t as strong as the 2025 group that sent 14 teams to the NCAAs.\n\nWith beatable Ole Miss coming to town Saturday and Chris Beard coming off an 84-66 beatdown courtesy of fellow former Longhorn coach Rick Barnes’ Tennessee team, there is a chance to stack a third straight win.\n\nThe Horns avoided a fate similar to what happened to the football team after it lost to a bad Florida team, effectively crippling its chances to make the College Football Playoff. In basketball’s case, they figured it out thanks to a couple of second-half 3-pointers from Cam Heide, who has emerged as a needed source of offense of late; 15 second-half points from veteran guard Tramon Mark and another 20 from All-SEC candidate Dailyn Swain.\n\nWith football coach Steve Sarkisian and baseball coach Jim Schlossnagle seated together courtside, the Horns pulled it together in front of 10,286 who rose to their feet, some of them for the first time all evening.\n\nMORE HORNS: Texas athletics lost money in 2025\n\nOne question can apply to both the fans and the team they were watching. Where was the energy?\n\nWe understand that a 6 p.m. start and Austin traffic aren’t made for one another but the fans who were there for the tip didn’t bring a whole lot of energy to a team that has a recent history of slow starts. The Horns missed seven of their first eight shots and didn’t reach double digits until the 11-minute, 14-second mark of the first half.\n\n“The message is to keep being aggressive,” Heide said. “You’ve got to go in there and set the tone. If we do that, it’s really going to help.”\n\nMORE CED: Where Texas football landed on the Ceddy Awards\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, the crowd will help too.\n\nAt one point of the second half with the game still in the balance, coach Sean Miller raised his arms to the fans, asking them to give his team some energy. If we’re being honest, the crowd was as lethargic as the guys playing even if the result turned out in Texas’ favor.\n\n“The one thing about the crowd is you have to give them something to cheer about,” Miller said. “It’s not one-sided. They're coming here. They're sacrificing. They're coming to watch Texas. They want us to win. They want to see a great game. And you’ve got to be locked in.”\n\nTexas players, coming off a big win at Oklahoma, weren't locked in for large parts of the game, particularly point guard Jordan Pope who suffered through a 26-minute nightmare.\n\nOne of the most experienced guards in the college game missed five of his six field goal attempts and finished with no assists. He went without a field goal for the first 34-plus minutes. When asked if he would consider moving Pope to the wing, Miller said “I think we’ve got him at the right spot. He told me he was a point guard.”\n\nIt’s an understatement to say Texas plays to the competition because the Horns are good enough to give a good team like Auburn a tussle and shaky enough to be locked in a 50-50 wrestling match with the No. 15 team in the 16-team SEC.\n\nThey’re never going to be a shutdown defense as evidenced by the No. 96 defensive ranking per kenpom.com will attest. More important was a move up to No. 33 in Ken's NCAA NET ratings, seventh among SEC teams.\n\nSeven-foot sophomore post Matas Vokietaitis is going through some growing pains on both ends. He continues to commit careless fouls on defense and continues to get stripped by smaller players because he brings the ball down in traffic despite being only three feet from the bucket. He is second on the team with 53 turnovers, a huge number for the position. Worse yet, he missed more point-blank looks than his coaches care to count.\n\nLooking ahead, the Horns are in play to make a realistic run at the Big Dance but they can’t afford to give away winnable games. Ole Miss, at 11-11 overall and 3-6 in the SEC, represents a nice chance to move over .500 after 11 games for the first time since Rodney Terry took over the 2023 team after Beard’s firing. Texas started 8-3 and advanced to the Elite Eight with a win over Miller’s Xavier team that season.\n\nLots has changed since then and if you ask Miller, more change is needed — particularly on defense.\n\nIf anything, they’re in a good place considering where they started.",

    "description": "When the SEC’s membership voted to add a ninth conference game, you must wonder whether they thought a 16-team playoff would be in place in 2026.",
    "fullText": "When the SEC’s membership voted to add a ninth conference game, you must wonder whether they thought a 16-team playoff would be in place by the time the expanded conference schedule went into effect.\n\nYou also must wonder whether those SEC members still would’ve voted to expand the conference schedule, if they’d known the 12-team playoff would endure for the 2026 season.\n\nOn this edition of “SEC Football Unfiltered,” a podcast from the USA TODAY Network, hosts Blake Toppmeyer and John Adams unpack the SEC’s inability to strike a compromise with the Big Ten to reach on playoff expansion — and why the nine-game conference schedule might work to the SEC’s detriment in 2026.\n\nThey also debate whether the SEC should have gotten on board with the Big Ten’s plan for a 24-team playoff.\n\nAdams: I’ve long advocated for the SEC expanding its conference schedule to create a better product. However, I’m skeptical that the extra conference game will help the SEC’s playoff pursuits in 2026. You must ask: How much will the selection committee reward strength of schedule? Answer: Probably not as much as the SEC desires.\n\nA nine-game SEC schedule would have paired neatly with a 16-team playoff. SEC teams that finished 9-3 would’ve been prime candidates for at-large selection, in a 16-team field.\n\nThe selection committee still places a lot of value win-loss record, and an extra conference game will make it more difficult for SEC teams to reach 10-2.\n\nToppmeyer: The SEC needed a 16-team bracket for its nine-game conference schedule to pay off. The playoff committee has never selected a 9-3 team for a spot in the 12-team playoff, consistently rejecting SEC teams that pair nine wins with a lofty strength of schedule. Will the committee suddenly start admitting 9-3 SEC teams just because the conference added another league game? I’m skeptical of that.\n\nKudos to the Big Ten’s maneuvering. It argued for the SEC to add a ninth conference game, then threw up a roadblock toward expanding to a 5+11 playoff bracket that the SEC, Big 12 and ACC favored.\n\nWithout Big Ten support, the 5+11 playoff idea could not get approved. So, the SEC strengthened its schedule without successfully creating any more playoff bids. A 12-team playoff that’s worked well for the Big Ten persists.\n\nUnlike the SEC, the Big Ten does not require its members to play either a Power Four opponent or Notre Dame in the non-conference schedule, although many do.\n\nOverall, the Big Ten played the SEC like a fiddle.\n\nAdams: No. This combination of a nine-game SEC schedule with a 12-team playoff might not work to the SEC’s benefit, but that’s not enough reason to get lured into a 24-team playoff. A playoff of such size would turn the sport on its head and devalue the regular season.\n\nWhen we’re talking about almost the entire US LBM Coaches Poll Top 25 making the playoff, it's gotten too big.\n\nToppmeyer: No. If the SEC wants 16, then continue negotiating to try to bring that into effect in subsequent years.\n\nCommitting to 24, when three of the four power conferences want 16, just wouldn’t make sense. College football’s regular season is its greatest attribute. I’m skeptical of any playoff format that would dilute the regular season. The Big Team’s 24-team proposal would do that.\n\nBlake Toppmeyer is the USA TODAY Network's national college football columnist. John Adams is the senior sports columnist for the Knoxville News Sentinel. \n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

    "description": "The Longhorns hope to take advantage of three of the next four games at home against weaker conference opponents.",
    "fullText": "The Longhorns hope to take advantage of three of the next four games at home against weaker conference opponents.\n\nAt the midway point of SEC play, the Texas Longhorns are firmly on the NCAA Tournament bubble as the last team in the field of Joe Lunardi’s Bracketology after opening a winnable stretch of games with Saturday’s 10-point victory over the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman prior to hosting the South Carolina Gamecocks at the Moody Center on Tuesday.\n\nNext Saturday, disgraced former head coach Chris Beard brings his scuffling Ole Miss team to the Forty Acres, followed by a road game against Missouri and a home matchup against LSU. A win probability of 50 percent for the game in Columbia the lowest of that stretch for the Longhorns, creating an imperative for first-year head coach Sean Miller’s team to at least protect home court at the Moody Center.\n\nEven a win on Tuesday would represent just the second time in conference play that Texas has won back-to-back games and the only winning streak longer than that came early in the season when the Longhorns notched four straight games against some of the worst teams in the country.\n\nBut since the 14-point loss to Tennessee in Knoxville in which Texas struggled to compete, Miller’s team has had chances to win every other game, including in hostile environments like Rupp Arena in Lexington and Neville Arena in Auburn.\n\nAfter taking an eight-point lead into halftime against the Tigers, however, the game got away from the Longhorns in the second half because Texas committed 18 fouls that led to 28 free-throw attempts for Auburn.\n\n“Not a lot else changed, but what really changed is their free-throw attempts,” Miller said in an appearance on On Texas Football. “It’s not eight fouls that we’re trying to get rid of, it’s the two, three, or four undisciplined fouls that we can correct, that we are working hard to correct.”\n\nThose several undisciplined fouls add up quickly in close games — in the four SEC loses outside of the poor effort against the Volunteers, the Longhorns have lost by an average of 4.5 points.\n\n“That’s four free-throw attempts. They didn’t get into bonus as early. There’s a huge swing when you can foul less in college basketball, and I think that’s plagued our defense, and we could be a better overall defensive team. I’ve told our guys on a daily basis, if the number goes in the right direction defensively for us, a lot of the things that we’re hunting and going after will come true, but we’re only going to go as far on this path as our defensive improvement allows us,” Miller said.\n\nTexas currently ranks 297th in opposing free-throw rate.\n\nThe single player Miller needs to make strides in fouling less over the final nine SEC games is sophomore center Matas Vokietaitis, who is averaging 5.2 fouls per 40 minutes.\n\n“He gets fouled as much as any player that plays college basketball, so the spotlight is always on him — that means you have to be even more disciplined and smarter when it’s your turn to defend. There are times to be physical and there’s times to let it go, and there’s times that you have to show your hands and go vertical, and there’s times when you have to do a lot of work with your legs and your chest, your torso, and not your hands. We’ve had a hard time, truth be told, with Matas in that area, but he’s better than he was, for example, when we played in the Maui Invitational,” Miller said.\n\nVokietaitis is also better than he was last year as a freshman at Florida Atlantic in his first season playing basketball in the United States, cutting his fouling by almost a full foul per 40 minutes.\n\nFor the Texas team, however, a worse forced turnover rate than opposing free-throw rate is a bad duo.\n\n“We don’t force turnovers and we foul — that’s a wicked combination. Teams that don’t force turnovers can win big, but you cannot foul,” Miller said on Monday.\n\nThe other area defensively that the Longhorns need to improve in is three-point defense. Texas is limiting opponents to a three-point rate of 35.6 percent, 60th nationally, but allowing opponents to make 35.4 percent of those attempts 258th nationally.\n\nBecause the Horns have a low three-point rate and an even lower assist rate, the degree of difficulty for those three-point attempts is heightened because they often come off the dribble, and the combination of allowing that level of efficiency from opponents and not making up for it in volume can create large margins like the Hoos notching a 24-point edge in points off threes in their 19-point win in December.\n\nBut despite those weaknesses offensively, Miller and his staff have managed to create the most efficient offense at Texas since DJ Augustin and Damion James led the Longhorns to the Elite Eight in 2007-08, an attack built primarily on getting to the free-throw line and scoring in the paint.\n\nAnd it’s not just Vokietaitis buoying those areas of success — junior wing Dailyn Swain has also attempted more than 100 free throws so far this season and taken even more shots around the rim than the big Lithuanian.\n\nOver the last four games, Swain has been sensational, averaging 25.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 2.5 steals while shooting 64.9 percent from the floor, 44.4 percent from three, and 87.5 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nAlready one of the most dangerous players in the country off the bounce, Swain’s ability to shoot threes effectively is a force multiplier for his game, especially in bailing Texas out of poor possessions in late-clock situations.\n\nThe shooting improvement has taken a lot of hard work behind the scenes from Swain, whose high-major interest out of high school in Columbus was limited by his lack of shooting range.\n\n“It wasn’t that he couldn’t shoot or you didn’t like the way his shot looked like, he basically ignored that part of the game. He did it really almost through his entire time in high school,” Miller said.\n\nAfter signing with Xavier, Swain was 4-of-26 shooting from three as a freshman (15.4 percent) before showing some signs of improvement in making seven of his 28 attempts last season (25 percent). In practice, Miller and his staff spent a year and a half forcing the talented wing to shoot open threes, leading to enough improvement that he gained the confidence to take and make them in games — he’s now a 31.7-percent shooter this season and at 35.5 percent in SEC play.\n\nAs an almost 80 percent career shooter from the free-throw line, Swain’s ability to convert those opportunities gave Miller hope that he could eventually add a three-point shot to his game. Now he has, and it’s made him one of the most efficient scorers in the nation’s best basketball conference.\n\nSouth Carolina arrives in Austin with just two SEC wins, coming against LSU on the road and Oklahoma at home, leaving the Gamecocks at 15th in the conference in adjusted efficiency. But as the overtime loss to Mississippi State in the conference opener revealed a month ago, Texas can play poorly enough to lose to anyone, especially if the team is giving up a lot of three-pointers to opposing guards or debilitated by its fouling virus.\n\nSo Miller is emphasizing what the Longhorns need to do to win rather than focusing on the opponent specifically.\n\n“We just have to be at our best. Period. I think it’s like a nameless, faceless league. On your end, your preparation, your readiness, how you attack the game, how you play, you’ve got to be at your best, and the more you can be at your best, the better opportunity you have for success. So the only thing that’s different about this week is we have back-to-back home games. Other than that, I think we have to look at this — this is an SEC team and we all know what that is,” Miller said.\n\nTip is at 6 p.m. Central on SEC Network with Texas boasting an 85-percent win probability, according to Bart Torvik.",

    "description": "CBS Sports has Florida football 10th in its SEC power rankings because of the uncertainty surrounding the Gators as Jon Sumrall enters his first year.",
    "fullText": "Florida football finds itself right in the middle of the SEC pack in CBS Sports' power rankings for the 2026 season, a reflection of both uncertainty and quiet optimism surrounding the program entering Jon Sumrall's first year with the Orange and Blue.\n\nCBS Sports' Brandon Marcello slotted the Gators 10th in the SEC, placing Florida firmly in the conference's crowded middle tier following a chaotic transfer portal cycle and a full coaching reset.\n\nSumrall inherited a group that needed significant turnover, and that context matters. Florida lost key contributors to the portal, rebuilt large portions of its depth chart and is still sorting out several position battles heading into spring practice.\n\nCBS Sports pointed specifically to quarterback uncertainty, noting the compeition between Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo and Tramell Jones Jr. as a storyline that could ultimately swing Florida's ceiling one way or another.\n\nIt's simply too early to make definitive judgements. Spring practices, sumeer development and continued roster movement will reshape the conference landscape before fall arrives. For Florida, that means the current ranking by CBS Sports should be viewed more as a snapshot than a verdict.\n\nFor now, the Gators are positioned as a team with something to prove.\n\nHere is everything Marcello wrote about Florida and why he ranked them at No. 10 in the SEC power rankings.\n\n\"Jon Sumrall arrives with a major rebuild on his hands in Gainesville. The former Tulane and Troy coach has never won less than 10 games in a single season, but make sure to temper your expectations for Year 1 in the SEC. He had to overhaul a roster depleted by transfers, and we don't quite know what to expect with Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo battling Tramell Jones Jr. at quarterback.\n\n\"Still, Sumrall has the magic touch and knows how to build rosters. He also hired a top-tier staff. The Gators could be in the top half of the SEC this season, but we need to see more this spring and summer to better gauge the Gators.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.",

Tied with Tennessee and Kentucky, here are the SEC teams with more than one Quad 1A win.\n\nOver the next four games against Alabama (road), Florida (home), Missouri (road), and Vanderbilt (road), Texas A&M will have three Quad 1A opportunities, and winning one, or two of these tough matchups would likely guarentee the Aggies an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament, especially given the fact that McMillan's squad is a perfect 12-0 in Quad 3 and Quad 3 games.\n\nAfter Florida blew out Alabama 100-77 on Sunday night, Texas A&M has a chance to take advantage of the Crimson Tide's short turnaround before playing on Wednesday, but needs to play with the same mentality, and shoot at least 45% from the field, and hit free throws to have a chance at pulling off the upset.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M basketball's three Quad 1A wins tied for most in the SEC",

Auburn will also look to improve its conference record to 3-3 after starting conference play with a 1-3 record. Ole Miss enters the game with a record of 11-7, and they are 3-2 in the SEC. Auburn got a bounce-back win on Saturday, defeating South Carolina 71-67 to improve their overall record to 11-7.\n\nThe ESPN Matchup Predictor gives Auburn a slight edge in this game, with a 53.9% chance of winning. They have Ole Miss at 46.1% chance of winning.\n\nAuburn had to hold on late to gain its victory over South Carolina on Saturday night. Filip Jovic had his best game as an Auburn Tiger, scoring 23 points and was 9 of 12 from the floor. Jovic also pulled down six rebounds to lead the Tigers to a much-needed victory. Auburn needed the performance with Keyshawn Hall and Tahaad Pettiford struggling once again. Auburn's two stars combined for 17 points and were 4 of 15 on field goals. It was the second consecutive game where they both struggled to find their offense. The Tigers will need to play better in this road matchup.\n\nLike Auburn, Ole Miss started their SEC schedule 0-2 after losses to Oklahoma and Arkansas. They followed that up with three straight wins against Missouri, Georgia, and Mississippi State. The Rebels do rank last in the SEC, scoring just 76 points per game. However, they are third in the conference, allowing 70.8 points per game, and have held their opponents to 42% shooting. The Rebels' leading scorer is forward Malik Dia with 14.2 points per game. He has struggled over the previous two games and has not scored over double figures. Their other option is senior guard AJ Storr, who is averaging 13.3 points per game. He had 17 points in the Rebels' 68-67 win over rival Mississippi State on Saturday.\n\nThe Auburn Tigers will face the Ole Miss Rebels on the road for a Tuesday night contest scheduled for a start time of 8 p.m. CT.

    "fullText": "Cardinals urged to replace Kyler Murray with 30-TD SEC star originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals are undergoing some big changes this offseason.\n\nThe team endured a terrible season in 2025 and moved on from head coach Jonathan Gannon as a result. Now, the team is looking for a new coaching staff and could potentially be looking for a new quarterback as well.\n\nKyler Murray, who's been the team's passer since 2019, played in just five games this year. Even when Murray played, the results were underwhelming, and his massive contract isn't conducive to being a backup.\n\nAs a result, Jacob Infante of PFSN recently published a full seven-round mock draft that has the Cardinals taking a rookie quarterback.\n\nInfante has the Cardinals waiting until the third round and selecting Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss. Chambliss is currently in a legal battle to get one more year of college eligibility, but the expectation is that he will enter the draft.\n\nRegarding Chambliss and the Cardinals, Infante offered the following:\n\nThere are valid concerns with Trinidad Chambliss: he has an average arm, he’s undersized, and he started at the D1 level for only one year. That said, there’s also a lot to like. He’s a naturally accurate passer with impressive anticipation behind his throws, and he came in clutch in key situations for Ole Miss this year.\n\nSomeone will take a chance on him early, given how many NFL teams need quarterbacks this offseason.\n\nAs Infante mentioned, Chambliss only has one year of starting experience at the D1 level, but that one year was incredibly impressive.\n\nIn 2025 with Ole Miss, Chambliss threw for 3,937 yards with 22 touchdowns and just three interceptions. The quarterback also rushed for 527 yards and eight touchdowns, accounting for 30 total scores in 13 starts.\n\nBefore 2025, Chambliss played at DII Ferris State, where he won two national championships. The quarterback isn't the biggest, but he is bigger than Murray, and has a strong arm and nice mobility.\n\nIt wouldn't be easy to move on from Murray, though. The only way the team wouldn't have to eat a ton of dead money is if they traded Murray after June 1. In that scenario, the team would free up about $35 million in cap space.\n\nPatrick Mahomes comments on offensive coordinator Matt Nagy\n\nSteelers urged to replace Aaron Rodgers with SEC star\n\nSteelers could find new coach in a familiar place\n\nCould Steelers trade for former first-round pick?\n\nStephen A. Smith ripped by Jets reporter for controversial comments\n\nMike McDaniel could find a new job soon",

    "fullText": "The Texas A&M basketball team enters rivalry weekend looking to reset after a grueling double‑overtime loss to Tennessee. It was a tough shooting night across the board, and the Aggies will aim to get back on track Saturday when they travel to Austin to face the Texas Longhorns.\n\nFor head coach Bucky McMillan, it marks his first experience in the Lone Star Showdown — and an opportunity to do something no A&M coach has accomplished since 2001: win in Austin. He understands exactly what this rivalry means to Aggies everywhere, but he’s also pushing his team to stay grounded and avoid getting swept up in the noise.\n\n\" ...our players got to block out all the noise and just know that our success going to in this game is going to be on their ability to focus on the things that equate to winning basketball\"\n\nIt’s not about minimizing the rivalry, McMillan emphasized, but recognizing the bigger picture. The SEC grind is long, and every conference game carries weight. That perspective has been reinforced by A&M’s 3–1 start in league play — a stretch that has boosted the team’s confidence despite the close calls.\n\n\"it's been great and that's why I say we can get caught up like a game slips away here or there where you're right there to win it. But there's also a lot of games on the flipside of that that we executed and won,\"\n\nA win on Saturday would move the Aggies to 4–1 in SEC play, a meaningful early‑season marker that could pay dividends later in the year. For McMillan, the message remains simple: play their style, trust their habits, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nBelow, you can watch the full press conference with Coach Bucky.\n\nTexas A&M will face the Texas Longhorns in Austin at the Moody Center on Saturday, January 17, at 5 p.m. CT. The matchup will air on ESPN.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers in default might not face smaller paychecks — yet.\n\nEducation Sec. Linda McMahon told reporters at a visit to a Rhode Island school earlier this week that wage garnishment for defaulted student-loan borrowers has been put on pause.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter how the garnishment would impact borrowers, McMahon responded: \"Well, actually, there is a pause.\"\n\n\"We've now collected about $500 million,\" McMahon said. \"The next phase to go into a place was garnishment, and that's been put on pause for a bit.\"\n\nThe Department of Education did not make a formal announcement on this pause and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt follows an announcement from the department in December saying that it would begin sending wage garnishment notices to about 1,000 defaulted borrowers in early January, with the intent to increase the scale of those notices each month.\n\nIn May, the department resumed collections on defaulted student loans after a five-year pause. Defaulting on student loans, which typically happens after 270 days of missed payments, can have significant consequences in addition to wage garnishment, including seizure of federal benefits like Social Security and tax refunds.\n\nAissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at advocacy group Protect Borrowers, said in a statement that the administration's plans to garnish wages \"would have been economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf it were up to college football podcaster and analyst Josh Pate, the Big Ten-SEC debate as to which conference holds the cards isn't even close.\n\nPate said on a recent edition of \"Josh Pate's College Football Show\" that the Big Ten deserves the same respect, if not more, than the SEC in this current era of college football.\n\n“The SEC is lagging behind the Big Ten, at the top,\" Pate said. \"I would even venture to suggest the middle-tier now is at least comparable if not slightly lagging behind. That’s probably where my perception has changed of late, moreso than at the top. So I’m not beating that drum.”\n\nPate made an interesting follow-up point: it doesn't even matter that the Indiana Hoosiers are currently the class of the league. It's the psychological framework about what makes those players more polished than those from the SEC. And it's greater than just mental and physical toughness, Pate said.\n\nMore: Todd McShay passionately defends Dante Moore's decision to return to Oregon Ducks\n\n“Maybe the average Big Ten player is wired a little bit differently, maybe they focus a little more on the football aspect, the mean-and-potatoes aspect of football, instead of the more highlight-ish, branding aspect of football,” Pate said.\n\nThat \"wired\" approach is the most unique part. It can't be taught. It can't be studied.\n\n“If you think that’s ridiculous, it’s because it is,” Pate said. “But that’s been standard practice in the SEC for awhile. And I don’t find it to be the case in the Big Ten.”\n\nMore: Inside the special moment Indiana's Curt Cignetti will never forget\n\nWhether the narrative returns in favor of the SEC is unclear, but right now, the Big Ten can keep chasing excellence.\n\nEntering Monday night's game, a potential Hoosiers victory over the Miami Hurricanes may further validate Pate's argument while the SEC watches from the sidelines.\n\nWhat Dylan Raiola's commitment to Oregon Ducks signals for Dante Moore's NFL future\n\nCollege football analyst bashes SEC in defense of Big Ten as Indiana clinches title berth\n\nTodd McShay shares massive advice for Oregon QB Dante Moore on heels of NFL Draft decision\n\nIndiana QB Fernando Mendoza gets massive kudos from ex-NFL coach with interesting pro comp",
