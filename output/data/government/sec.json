    "fullText": "The Texas A&M basketball team enters rivalry weekend looking to reset after a grueling double‑overtime loss to Tennessee. It was a tough shooting night across the board, and the Aggies will aim to get back on track Saturday when they travel to Austin to face the Texas Longhorns.\n\nFor head coach Bucky McMillan, it marks his first experience in the Lone Star Showdown — and an opportunity to do something no A&M coach has accomplished since 2001: win in Austin. He understands exactly what this rivalry means to Aggies everywhere, but he’s also pushing his team to stay grounded and avoid getting swept up in the noise.\n\n\" ...our players got to block out all the noise and just know that our success going to in this game is going to be on their ability to focus on the things that equate to winning basketball\"\n\nIt’s not about minimizing the rivalry, McMillan emphasized, but recognizing the bigger picture. The SEC grind is long, and every conference game carries weight. That perspective has been reinforced by A&M’s 3–1 start in league play — a stretch that has boosted the team’s confidence despite the close calls.\n\n\"it's been great and that's why I say we can get caught up like a game slips away here or there where you're right there to win it. But there's also a lot of games on the flipside of that that we executed and won,\"\n\nA win on Saturday would move the Aggies to 4–1 in SEC play, a meaningful early‑season marker that could pay dividends later in the year. For McMillan, the message remains simple: play their style, trust their habits, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nBelow, you can watch the full press conference with Coach Bucky.\n\nTexas A&M will face the Texas Longhorns in Austin at the Moody Center on Saturday, January 17, at 5 p.m. CT. The matchup will air on ESPN.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers in default might not face smaller paychecks — yet.\n\nEducation Sec. Linda McMahon told reporters at a visit to a Rhode Island school earlier this week that wage garnishment for defaulted student-loan borrowers has been put on pause.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter how the garnishment would impact borrowers, McMahon responded: \"Well, actually, there is a pause.\"\n\n\"We've now collected about $500 million,\" McMahon said. \"The next phase to go into a place was garnishment, and that's been put on pause for a bit.\"\n\nThe Department of Education did not make a formal announcement on this pause and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt follows an announcement from the department in December saying that it would begin sending wage garnishment notices to about 1,000 defaulted borrowers in early January, with the intent to increase the scale of those notices each month.\n\nIn May, the department resumed collections on defaulted student loans after a five-year pause. Defaulting on student loans, which typically happens after 270 days of missed payments, can have significant consequences in addition to wage garnishment, including seizure of federal benefits like Social Security and tax refunds.\n\nAissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at advocacy group Protect Borrowers, said in a statement that the administration's plans to garnish wages \"would have been economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt.\"",

    "fullText": "Josh Pate declares whether Big Ten has overtaken SEC in college football moving forward originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf it were up to college football podcaster and analyst Josh Pate, the Big Ten-SEC debate as to which conference holds the cards isn't even close.\n\nPate said on a recent edition of \"Josh Pate's College Football Show\" that the Big Ten deserves the same respect, if not more, than the SEC in this current era of college football.\n\n“The SEC is lagging behind the Big Ten, at the top,\" Pate said. \"I would even venture to suggest the middle-tier now is at least comparable if not slightly lagging behind. That’s probably where my perception has changed of late, moreso than at the top. So I’m not beating that drum.”\n\nPate made an interesting follow-up point: it doesn't even matter that the Indiana Hoosiers are currently the class of the league. It's the psychological framework about what makes those players more polished than those from the SEC. And it's greater than just mental and physical toughness, Pate said.\n\nMore: Todd McShay passionately defends Dante Moore's decision to return to Oregon Ducks\n\n“Maybe the average Big Ten player is wired a little bit differently, maybe they focus a little more on the football aspect, the mean-and-potatoes aspect of football, instead of the more highlight-ish, branding aspect of football,” Pate said.\n\nThat \"wired\" approach is the most unique part. It can't be taught. It can't be studied.\n\n“If you think that’s ridiculous, it’s because it is,” Pate said. “But that’s been standard practice in the SEC for awhile. And I don’t find it to be the case in the Big Ten.”\n\nMore: Inside the special moment Indiana's Curt Cignetti will never forget\n\nWhether the narrative returns in favor of the SEC is unclear, but right now, the Big Ten can keep chasing excellence.\n\nEntering Monday night's game, a potential Hoosiers victory over the Miami Hurricanes may further validate Pate's argument while the SEC watches from the sidelines.\n\nWhat Dylan Raiola's commitment to Oregon Ducks signals for Dante Moore's NFL future\n\nCollege football analyst bashes SEC in defense of Big Ten as Indiana clinches title berth\n\nTodd McShay shares massive advice for Oregon QB Dante Moore on heels of NFL Draft decision\n\nIndiana QB Fernando Mendoza gets massive kudos from ex-NFL coach with interesting pro comp",
