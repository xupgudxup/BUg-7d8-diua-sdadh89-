    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — The U.S. State Department said Thursday that it would pay up to $10 million for information leading to the arrests or convictions of two brothers identified as leaders of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel in the state of Baja California, which includes Tijuana.\n\nThe reward offer came the same day that authorities announced a new indictment against Rene Arzate Garcia, 42, known as “La Rana\" (\"The Frog\"). He was initially charged with drug crimes in San Diego. The superseding indictment includes charges of conspiracy, narcoterrorism and material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.\n\nThe U. S. is offering $5 million each for information on Rene Arzate Garcia and Alfonso Arzate Garcia, 52, known as “Aquiles” (\"Achilles\"). Their whereabouts are unknown.\n\n“As controllers of a critical trafficking node in Tijuana at the U.S. border, the Arzate-Garcia brothers have become key essential components of the cartel’s command-and-control structure,” the State Department said. “Their control of the Tijuana Plaza offers the Sinaloa Cartel a tactical advantage in maintaining dominance over rival organizations, ensuring no interruption to the busiest border crossing in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nCalifornia's border with Mexico has been a battleground between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels.\n\nThe rewards were announced four days after the Mexican army killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, “El Mencho,” decapitating what had become Mexico’s most powerful cartel. The drug lord was the Mexican government’s biggest prize yet to show the Trump administration in its efforts to crack down on the cartels.",

    "fullText": "NORWICH, Conn. (AP) — The U.S. State Department has ordered certain public libraries nationwide to cease processing passport applications, disrupting a long-standing service that librarians say their communities have come to rely on and that has run smoothly for years.\n\nThe agency, which regulates U.S. passports, began issuing cease and desist orders to not-for-profit libraries in late fall, informing them they were no longer authorized to participate in the Passport Acceptance Facility program as of Friday.\n\n“We still get calls daily seeking that service,” said Cathleen Special, executive director of the Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut, where passport services were offered for 18 years but ceased in November after receiving the letter. “Our community was so used to us offering this.”\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the order was given because federal law and regulations “clearly prohibit non-governmental organizations” from collecting and retaining fees for a passport application. Government-run libraries are not impacted.\n\nThe spokesperson did not respond to questions as to why it has become an issue now and exactly how many libraries are impacted by the cease and desist order. In a statement, they said, “passport services has over 7,500 acceptance facilities nationwide and the number of libraries found ineligible makes up less than one percent of our total network.”\n\nThe American Library Association estimates about 1,400 mostly non-profit public libraries nationwide could potentially be affected, or about 15% of all public libraries, depending on how many offer passport services.\n\nDemocratic and Republican members of Congress from Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Maryland are pushing back, sending a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month asking him to extend the existing program until Congress finds a permanent solution.\n\n\"In a time when demand for passports is surging, libraries are among the most accessible passport acceptance facilities, particularly for working families and rural residents,” the members wrote.\n\nThe lawmakers' letter said people will have to travel long distances, take unpaid time off from work or forgo getting a passport when demand is surging due to Real ID requirements. If Republicans in Congress impose strict new voting rules, citizens could need their passport or birth certificate to register. People fearing immigration agents are also increasingly carrying passports to confirm their citizenship.\n\nThey said the change is particularly disruptive to their states, where many public libraries are structured as nonprofit entities. They predicted some libraries, which benefit financially from passport processing fees, will have to lay off staff, cut programs or close their doors if not allowed to continue providing passport services.\n\nPublic libraries are organized differently in each state. In Pennsylvania 85% of public libraries are non-profit organizations, versus being a department of a local municipal government. In Maine, it's 56%; Rhode Island, 54%, New York, 47% and Connecticut, 46%, according to the American Library Association.\n\nPennsylvania Reps. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat, and John Joyce, a Republican, have proposed bipartisan legislation that would allow 501(c)(3) non-profit public libraries to continue to serve as passport acceptance facilities by amending the Passport Act of 1920. A similar companion bill is pending in the Senate.\n\nDean, who first learned about the policy change from a library in her district that has provided passport services for 20 years, called the State Department's interpretation of the law “nonsense.”\n\nIn Joyce's rural, south-central Pennsylvania district, the Marysville-Rye Library is one of only two passport facilities serving the 556-square-mile Perry County, according to the letter to Rubio. Now the county courthouse will be the only remaining option.\n\nThe State Department noted that 99% of the U.S. population lives within 20 miles of a designated passport processing location, such as a post office, county clerk's office or government-run library authorized to accept in-person passport applications.\n\n“Should the removal of an ineligible facility affect passport services, we will work to identify new eligible program partners in the impacted area,” the agency spokesperson said.\n\nBut Special said the Norwich post office had often referred people to her library for passports when someone needed service outside regular hours or had children who needed to be watched and entertained while their parent filled out the paperwork. Library staff also assisted applicants with language barriers.\n\n“And now the burden falls on them to do all of it and that’s tough on them,\" she said of the post office down the street. \"I don’t know how they’re keeping up, to be honest, because it was such a popular service with us.”",

    "description": "The US State Department warns Americans not to travel to these 21 countries due to risks like terrorism, kidnapping, and limited embassy support.",
    "fullText": "Overseas travel can be an immensely enriching experience, from learning about different cultures to seeing some of the world's greatest sights, but in some countries, it can also come with risks.\n\nThe US State Department ranks 21 countries around the world as a travel advisory level four, \"Do Not Travel\" due to risks like terrorism and kidnapping.\n\n\"All countries will rank destinations slightly differently,\" Alan Fyall, a professor of tourism at the University of Central Florida, told Business Insider.\n\nWhile they frequently overlap, the US and the UK don't have identical lists, for example. Historical and cultural ties, proximity, and level of familiarity may all play a role in shaping these lists, he said.\n\nFor some of these countries, the US has suspended embassy operations. That makes it difficult for it to assist travelers when they're in trouble, and that's part of the reason the warnings can be stringent, said Fyall.\n\n\"Do you really want to go and rescue your citizens from a country that, really, they're not that advised to go to in the first place?\" he said.\n\nThe US and UK governments also issue warnings for specific areas in some countries, such as near the Thailand-Malaysia border, the Western Desert in Egypt, or parts of Israel. In July 2025, the US State Department changed Israel and the West Bank's travel advisory from a \"do-not-travel\" to a \"reconsider travel\" country, but the level four advisory has remained for Gaza as well as the Israeli regions near the Lebanese, Syrian, or Egyptian borders.\n\nWhile some risk-takers travel to these countries for a thrill, others visit family or for business.\n\n\"Some people think the perceived risk is overstated,\" Edward Dramberger, a University of South Carolina tourism and hospitality professor, told Business Insider.\n\nFor those who travel to level-four countries, the US State Department often offers routine advice, including staying aware of your surroundings, keeping your travel documents on hand, drafting a will before travel, creating a plan to leave the country without the aid of the US government, and monitoring local news for emergency situations.\n\nNations and regions can change travel advisory levels on the US' list based on changing circumstances, but these are the 21 countries the State Department considers \"do-not-travel\" zones as of January 2026.\n\nSitting between Iran and Pakistan, mountainous Afghanistan has rugged terrain and an arid climate.\n\n\"People perceive Afghanistan as just a desolate, mountain desert country with no attributes, no culture, which is wrong,\" Dramberger said.\n\nDecades of coups, civil wars, and invasions have made the country difficult for travelers to get to know, except via the news.\n\nThe US State Department lists crime, civil unrest, terrorism, wrongful detention, health, and kidnapping among the safety concerns when traveling to Afghanistan. Medical care may be more difficult to obtain in rural areas.\n\nIn 2021, the US Embassy in Kabul closed its operations in the country.\n\nThe agency recommends that American visitors keep a low profile while in the country.\n\nOnce part of the Soviet Union, Belarus maintains close ties with its neighbor, Russia. From Gothic architecture to rare near-endangered species, Belarus has attractions for castle seekers and nature enthusiasts.\n\nIn recent years, Belarus has allowed Russia to use some of its territory to invade Ukraine.\n\nThe risk of civil unrest makes visits to Belarus unwise, according to the State Department. The US Embassy suspended operations there in 2022.\n\nAmericans traveling to Belarus should exercise the usual precautions for visiting high-risk countries and consider leaving their phones, computers, and other electronic devices behind. The State Department also recommends not accessing social media accounts while in Belarus because they may be monitored.\n\nOuagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, is a West African hub of culture and arts, and the country also has an incredible wildlife refuge, Réserve de Nazinga, near its border with Ghana.\n\nDespite the country's positive attributes, the US State Department advises that travelers avoid visiting the country.\n\nThe country's government has declared a state of emergency for several regions.\n\nTerrorism, crime, and other threats have displaced over 2 million residents, as reported by the United Nations. While the displacement crisis has been slowly decreasing, the country still finds itself engulfed in a deep humanitarian crisis.\n\nSince 2015, several citizens of countries like the US have been kidnapped in Burkina Faso, according to the US Overseas Security Advisory Council, which classifies the situation in the country as \"critical.\"\n\nWhile the US Embassy still operates in Ouagadougou, government employees are unable to travel to many parts of the country due to safety concerns, which include the threat of terrorist violence.\n\nIn January 2026, the US government began suspending visas and limiting entry for citizens of 39 countries, including Burkina Faso. As a response measure, the West African country also suspended visas for US citizens.\n\nThe US government's recommendations for lowering risk while traveling in Burkina Faso include avoiding areas where Westerners typically travel and not resisting if someone attempts to rob you.\n\nThe Central African Republic touches several other level-four countries, including Sudan and South Sudan, and is home to incredibly rich biodiversity in its national parks, including Dzanga-Sangha National Park and Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park.\n\nMany of the country's species are endangered, and its citizens have faced decades of instability, according to the United Nations.\n\nRecently, armed groups have targeted Muslims and refugees.\n\nThe US State Department considers CAR a dangerous travel destination due to threats of terrorism, crime, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, and kidnapping, as well as health concerns. US citizens can expect limited help from the US Embassy in Bangui, CAR's capital.\n\nDue to the threat of kidnapping, the US' travel advisory website suggests travelers leave DNA samples with their doctor and establish proof-of-life protocols with family or friends so they can assist you if you're abducted. The State Department also suggests keeping a low profile, avoiding travel to rebel-controlled areas, and not resisting robbery attempts.\n\nThe Caribbean country of Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. The country, which won its independence from France in 1804, maintains some of its historic monuments, like its Citadelle Laferrière.\n\nIn recent years, the country has fallen under a state of emergency. In July 2023, the US ordered government employees to leave the country, and since 2025, the US government has enforced a ban on flights to Port-au-Prince, its capital, due to gang violence. The ban has since been extended to March 2026, and the country's capital remains cut off from US travel.\n\nIn addition to the flight ban, the country is also under a travel ban to the US, meaning that its citizens cannot enter the country, and that new visas are not being issued.\n\nIn the capital city of Port-au-Prince, local authorities have enforced curfews and \"shelter-in-place\" advisories since the beginning of the state of emergency.\n\nThe State Department has warned that armed robberies, sexual assaults, and kidnappings are among the reasons to reconsider travel to Haiti.\n\nAnyone who does go should avoid walking in the streets when possible, travel in groups, and keep vehicle doors and windows locked when driving, according to the State Department.\n\nOne way to see over 800 miles of this Middle Eastern country is the Trans-Iranian Railway, which runs from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf. Tehran, the capital, lies along the route.\n\nSome of the country's natural wonders include dormant volcanoes and the stunning limestone formations of Badab-e Surt.\n\nRight now, it's not safe for US citizens to travel to the country, according to the State Department.\n\nFollowing protests in 2022, thousands of people were arrested and tortured by Iranian authorities, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSince December 2025, massive anti-government protests have broken out in the country yet again and have recently resulted in violent crackdowns by state actors, with thousands of deaths and arrests in the tens of thousands. The Iranian government has also imposed an internet blackout in efforts to censor information about the protests.\n\nThe US government has cautioned that Iranian officials may wrongfully and arbitrarily detain or imprison US nationals and other foreigners.\n\nThe travel advisory also warns of terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nThe US doesn't have a physical embassy in Iran. The American government's travel advisory site states that visitors should have a means of leaving Iran that doesn't depend on its assistance, as it cannot provide consular support or facilitate departure from the country.\n\nFrom the Tigris and Euphrates to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Iraq holds sites that many remember from their ancient history textbooks. Sadly, some of its artifacts were lost to looting during the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\nSince the US invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Iraq has faced threats from terrorist groups such as ISIS.\n\nTerrorism, kidnapping, and civil unrest are enough of a risk that the State Department considers Iraq a level-four country.\n\nAs of August 2025, ISIS was still active in parts of Iraq, according to OSAC. Armed conflict and terrorist threats are dangerous at the northern borders, per the State Department.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US travelers should avoid the country's northern border and consider making arrangements with a professional security organization for any visits. US employees in the country are also forbidden from using Baghdad International Airport for travel due to security concerns.\n\nAt just over 4,000 square miles, Lebanon is just a bit bigger than Puerto Rico.\n\nA lengthy civil war from 1975 to 1990 left scars in its capital city of Beirut and beyond. In recent years, an economic crisis has taken a toll. Meanwhile, conflicts in neighboring Israel and Syria have also affected Lebanon.\n\nThe US government has said that terrorist groups operating in Lebanon put travelers at risk. There have been suicide bombings, and a gunman opened fire at the embassy in Beirut in June 2024.\n\nThe country's level four travel advisory warns of crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, armed conflict, and unexploded land mines.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US citizens should especially avoid Southern Lebanon, the country's border with Syria, and refugee settlements, urging them to depart if they are there.\n\nVisitors should take the advised security measures for high-risk countries and have a kidnapping protocol in place with family members, per the State Department.\n\nSituated between Egypt and Algeria, Libya has a coastline along the gorgeous Mediterranean Sea. Roman emperor Septimius Severus was born in Leptis Magna, an UNESCO World Heritage site with striking ruins of large, impressive buildings.\n\nViolence, including two recent civil wars, has marred the country. Armed groups have attacked hotels and airports in Tripoli, Sruman, and other cities, according to the State Department. The US Embassy hasn't been active in Tripoli since 2014.\n\nThe State Department warns of violent crime, terrorism, unexploded land mines, civil unrest, widespread kidnapping, and armed conflict throughout the country, and suggests that US citizens draft a will and consult with a professional security organization if traveling to the country.\n\nThe agency urges US citizens in the country to depart as soon as possible via commercial means, even though US commercial flights aren't allowed to operate within the country's airspace.\n\nCenturies-old mosques can be found in Mali's Timbuktu, symbols of its history as a seat of Islamic culture and learning. Its marketplace drew travelers and traders during the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nTo the southwest of Timbuktu is Bamako, Mali's capital. Outside the city and in other parts of the country, terrorists and kidnappers target foreign visitors in the hopes of getting a ransom, according to OSAC. US personnel aren't allowed to visit nightclubs or attend concerts for safety reasons.\n\nThe State Department's advisory warns of terrorism, civil unrest, inadequate health services, and violent crime, including kidnapping, throughout the country.\n\nSome advice for traveling in Mali includes avoiding walking deserted streets at night, carrying minimal cash, not leaving valuables in your hotel, and looking for a well-lit area when stopped by police.\n\nUS citizens are also advised to avoid travel outside Bamako and to have a plan to leave an emergency plan that doesn't require help from the US government.\n\nLocated on the Bay of Bengal in Southeast Asia, Myanmar boasts a fascinating mix of architecture, from pagodas and palaces to colonial hotels and government offices. One stupa, or pagoda, the Shwedagon, is the country's most sacred Buddhist site.\n\nA coup in 2021 sparked demonstrations. The military detained protestors and used force against them and bystanders, according to the State Department.\n\nThe risk of continued civil unrest and wrongful detentions, and arbitrary arrests, as well as poor health infrastructure, land mines, and crime, makes it unwise to travel to the country, according to the US State Department travel advisory.\n\nSome armed groups have used improvised explosive devices in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, while NGOs have reported land mines in Shan State, Chin State, and Kachin State.\n\nVisitors to the landlocked African country of Niger can explore the ancient mud-brick mosque of Grande Mosquée d'Agadez and the storied old town of Agadez, as well as see the Sahara Desert and the country's unique wildlife.\n\nIn October 2025, the US authorized that all government employees leave the country due to widespread safety concerns. Parts of the country have been under a state of emergency for over a decade, and local authorities \"require military escorts for any foreigners\" traveling outside the capital, Niamey, per the US State Department.\n\nThe agency warns of violent crime, civil unrest, terrorism, limited health services, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nIf they choose to visit anyway, US citizens are advised by the government to draft a will and have an emergency plan that doesn't depend on support from the US Embassy.\n\nOne of the world's most mysterious and isolated countries, North Korea shares borders with South Korea, China, and Russia. Kim Jong-Un took over the presidency in 2011, continuing a family dynasty that's been in power since the 1950s.\n\nIn 2025, North Korea reopened to Western tourists for the first time since the pandemic. The State Department warns that US nationals may be arrested and held for extended periods.\n\nIt warns that it cannot provide emergency services to its citizens who are detained, as the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.\n\nRussia's cities contain dazzling buildings, and its landscape is breathtaking. Siberia's Lake Baikal is the planet's oldest and deepest. The world's last woolly mammoths lived and died out on Wrangel Island, where polar bears, musk oxen, and walruses now congregate.\n\nDue to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US State Department has declared it unsafe for US citizens, who may face harassment or detention. The US State Department urges every US citizen in the country to leave immediately, and notes that authorities might not inform the US government if an American is arrested.\n\nThe US' travel advisory also cited drone attacks and explosions in Moscow, St. Petersburg, locations near the Ukrainian border, and other areas.\n\nThe State Department notes there may be risks for those with dual US-Russian nationality. Because the situation is volatile, travelers should stay informed about the latest local news while visiting.\n\nDigital communications also pose a risk, and the agency advises US citizens to reconsider bringing any electronic devices into the country, as the Russian government's security services closely monitor electronic communications and can use them to arrest foreign nationals.\n\nThose who still choose to travel to the country are advised by the government to prepare for wrongful detention, draft a will, and leave DNA samples with a medical provider.\n\nLocated in the Horn of Africa, Somalia's lengthy coastline borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. Somali archaeologist Sada Mire has called the capital, Mogadishu, an \"unbreakable pearl,\" tracing its history as a trade center back to the first century AD.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Somalia experienced famine and civil war. Instability continued in the form of terror attacks, including a suicide bombing on a popular beach in 2024.\n\nDue to the possibility of kidnapping, terrorism, and civil unrest, the US has issued a do-not-travel advisory. The State Department notes that the US also has very limited consular services in the country and that health services in Somalia can be limited and absent in rural areas.\n\nThe State Department also advised against sailing near Somalia's coast due to piracy.\n\nIt was only during the 21st century that South Sudan declared its independence and was recognized as a sovereign state. Its neighbors include Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIts short history was dominated by a civil war, and a new conflict is brewing between the military and an opposition force, which clashed near the Ethiopian border. NGOs, the UN, and others have found it difficult to accurately assess crime levels, but firearms easily cross the border from Sudan, according to OSAC.\n\nThe US State Department warns of civil unrest, violent crimes, kidnapping, unexploded land mines, and limited health services in the country and urges US citizens not to travel to the country for any reason.\n\nAnyone traveling in South Sudan should avoid its border areas and adhere to restrictions around public photography and videography, the State Department says.\n\nKhartoum, Sudan, is where the Blue and White Niles meet. Meroë is further north, where ancient Kushite rulers lived and were buried in pyramids. Some date back to the third century BCE; several have collapsed but others retain decorative carvings.\n\nCivil war threatens not only the archaeological history but locals and travelers. Officials at the US Embassy hastily evacuated Khartoum in 2023, soon after the conflict broke out. Various groups frequently engage in violent fighting, the State Department says.\n\nThe Darfur, Khartoum, and Kordofan regions have all been sites for kidnappings, according to OSAC. The Khartoum International Airport is closed.\n\nThe State Department warns of widespread violent crime, kidnapping, terrorism, unrest, unexploded land mines, and extremely limited health services in the country.\n\nThe US travel advisory suggests travelers be aware of their surroundings, especially in locations where Westerners typically visit, and that they draft a proof-of-life protocol with loved ones in case of kidnapping.\n\nNot only is Damascus the capital of Syria, but it's also the seat of cultural history. Established over 2,000 years ago, it's one of the oldest cities in the Middle East. Evidence of its Roman and Byzantine past exists alongside important Islamic monuments such as the Umayyad Mosque.\n\nDespite the allure of these ancient sites, the US doesn't recommend travel to Syria. A lengthy civil war broke out in 2011, with efforts to oust Bashar Assad from power. Since Assad resigned at the end of 2024, violence has continued to erupt in parts of western Syria.\n\nThe State Department has also warned that terrorism, kidnapping and hostage-taking, and unjust detention are risks in Syria, saying that \"no part of Syria is safe from violence.\"\n\nThe agency recommends visitors set up proof-of-life protocols with loved ones, among other precautions, before and during travel.\n\nMuch like Istanbul's Hagia Sofia, for which it was named, the Saint Sophia Cathedral serves as an eye-catching landmark in Kyiv. It's just one of the Ukrainian capital's architectural treasures.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and years of fighting have ensued, mainly in the east, where the border lies. Belarusian troops are also present along its border with Ukraine.\n\nThe ongoing conflict is the principal reason the US government cautions against visiting. Areas that aren't on the frontline of fighting could still experience drone and missile attacks, the State Department notes.\n\nDrafting a will, coordinating a security plan, and creating a communication protocol with loved ones are just a few of the steps suggested on the travel advisory website.\n\nWith its dizzying height of over 3,000 feet, the Salto Ángel waterfall has drawn tourists for decades, though it's notoriously tricky to access. It's found in the southeast of Venezuela, in the Canaima National Park, in the Amazon rainforest near the border with Brazil and Guyana.\n\nThe country is in the midst of an economic and political crisis. Heavily reliant on oil for income, it suffered years of recession. In 2024, the US and several other countries refused to recognize the results of its presidential election, calling it fraudulent, BBC News reported at the time.\n\nSince then, the US has launched a multifaceted military presence that has increased naval posture and tensions in the Caribbean and led to the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by US military forces in January.\n\nThe US Embassy ceased operations in Caracas in 2019 amid the country's deep economic crisis. The State Department has issued warnings about arbitrary detentions and unpredictable enforcement of local laws. In 2023 and 2025, Venezuela released several Americans, some of whom were \"wrongfully detained,\" according to the US government.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory emphasizes the \"extreme danger to US citizens living in or traveling to Venezuela\" and urges all US citizens and lawful permanent residents to leave the country immediately.\n\nThe travel advisory warns of wrongful detention and torture, arbitrary law enforcement, civil unrest, widespread violent crime, including kidnapping, and poor health services throughout the country.\n\nTravelers who still choose to visit the country may want to hire a professional security team during their stay and prepare a will before their trip, according to the US travel advisory site.\n\nBeautiful gypsum patterns adorn red fired-brick buildings in the Old City of Sana'a. People have lived in this area of Yemen for over 2,500 years. The country is located on the Arabian Peninsula next to Saudi Arabia and Oman.\n\nYemen's civil war started over a decade ago and continues today. The threat of armed conflict continues, according to OSAC. Detained US citizens have not been allowed to contact their families or the embassy, which suspended its operations in 2015.\n\nThe US travel advisory says US citizens should avoid travel to the country due to the threat of terrorism, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, crime, including kidnapping, and health risks.\n\nThe State Department warns against visiting the Yemeni island of Socotra. Some travel companies have offered trips there with unofficial visas, which puts travelers at risk, according to the travel advisory website.",

The risk of harassment or wrongful detention, arbitrary enforcement of local laws and the possibility of terrorism were also cited.\n\nAmericans who are in Russia are advised to leave immediately.\n\n“The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has reduced its staff. The Russian government has also restricted travel for embassy personnel. All U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services,” the State Department said in its warning.\n\nViolence is a continual threat in the country, officials warned.\n\nThere have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg and other large cities and, in 2024, ISIS Khorasan claimed responsibility for an attack at Crocus Music Hall in Moscow that killed 130 people. Places of worship have also been targeted.\n\nU.S. citizens could also become victims of harassment, mistreatment and extortion.\n\n“Russian officials have questioned, threatened, and detained U.S. citizens without reason. This includes both former and current U.S. government and military personnel, as well as private U.S. citizens. Russian authorities have a history of wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals and using them as bargaining chips,” the State Department warned.\n\nOther counties on the State Department’s “Do Not Travel” list include Afghanistan, Belarus, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Niger, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Ukraine.\n\nIf you must travel to Russia, the State Department has a list of safety precautions.

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Imran Ahmed says US companies are ‘corrupting the system’ of politics by seeking to avoid accountability\n\nA British anti-disinformation campaigner told by the Trump administration that he faces possible removal from the US has said he is being targeted by arrogant and “sociopathic” tech companies for trying to hold them to account.\n\nImran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), is among five European nationals barred from the US by the state department after being accused of seeking to push tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nAhmed lives lawfully in Washington DC with his American wife and daughter, meaning he is at risk of deportation. Late on Thursday a court granted him a temporary restraining order to block any attempt to remove him from the US or detain him.\n\nAhmed told the Guardian he believed he had been singled out for his work seeking greater accountability and transparency for social media and AI firms, which has led to Elon Musk’s X unsuccessfully suing CCDH.\n\nAhmed, who is a friend of Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, said it was another attempt to deflect accountability and transparency.\n\n“This has never been about politics,” he said, adding that his organisation had worked successfully with the first Trump administration and would do so again if asked.\n\n“What it has been about is companies that simply do not want to be held accountable and, because of the influence of big money in Washington, are corrupting the system and trying to bend it to their will, and their will is to be unable to be held accountable,” he said.\n\n“There is no other industry, that acts with such arrogance, indifference and a lack of humility and sociopathic greed at the expense of people.”\n\nAs well as Ahmed, the state department has barred the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accused the five people of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.\n\nSarah Rogers, an official at the state department, posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”\n\nThe sanctions are being seen as the latest attack on European regulations that target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have said the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.\n\nAhmed, who began his career working with Labour politicians in Westminster, said he had not yet formally received any notification from the US government, and that he believed its case against him was unfounded. “I’m very confident that our first amendment rights will be upheld by the court,” he said.\n\nThe next court hearing, due on Monday, is expected to confirm the protective order that prevents the US government from detaining him, said Ahmed, who spent Christmas away from his wife and infant daughter amid the legal battle.\n\nHe said this was “a rational thing for us to do, given that in every other case to date where someone has had a green card withdrawn in the last few months, they have been arrested and detained and often spirited hundreds or thousands of miles away from their friends, family and support networks.”\n\nThe CCDH has previously angered Musk over reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took it over. Musk tried unsuccessfully to sue the CCDH last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”.\n\nMore recently, the CCDH released a report warning about harmful answers produced by the latest version of ChatGPT when asked about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.\n\n“We’ve seen that social media and AI companies are increasingly under pressure as a result of organisations like mine,” Ahmed said. “No one likes being exposed as mendacious or hypocritical, but they call their friends in government or they call their pitbull litigation lawyers and start suing.”\n\nAhmed said it was particularly jarring to be targeted given that hate speech and misinformation was increasingly a bipartisan issue, raised as a concern by some Republican politicians as well as Democrats.\n\nHe said he was nonetheless ready to respond with a swift legal response when he heard the news. “When you take on the world’s biggest corporations and when you’ve had the experiences we’ve had, being sued by the world’s richest man, you dissociate and compartmentalise immediately.”\n\nThere had been a cost already, he said. “Nothing I’m going through compares to any of the parents I sit with who’ve lost their children,” Ahmed said. “I chose to take on the biggest companies in the world, to hold them accountable, to speak truth to power. There is a cost attached to that. My family understands that.\n\n“The only time I felt any sadness at all is last night when my wife told me that our child said her sixth word, and then I cried a bit.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, those targeted will generally be barred from entering the US, and some may face removal proceedings if already in the country.\n\nRubio did not name those targeted, but under secretary for public diplomacy Sarah Rogers identified them on X, accusing the individuals of “fomenting censorship of American speech”.\n\nThe five named were: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index’; and former EU commissioner Breton.\n\nThe visa bans come after the administration’s National Security Strategy this month said European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk “civilisational erasure” for the continent.\n\nRogers called Breton – who served as the European Commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024 – “a mastermind” of the DSA.\n\nMelford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), said in a video posted online in 2024 that she co-founded the organisation “to try to break the business model of harmful online content” by reviewing online news websites to allow advertisers to “choose whether or not they want to fund content that is polarising and divisive and harmful, or whether they want to steer their advertising back towards more quality journalism.”\n\nA spokesperson for GDI called the US action “immoral, unlawful, and un-American” and “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”\n\nMost Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don’t necessarily need visas to come into the US. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.\n\nWith Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive on Wednesday warned that it would take action against any “unjustified measures” after the U.S. State Department barred five Europeans it accuses of pressuring U.S. technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nThe Europeans were characterized by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations. They include the former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton.\n\nBreton, a businessman and former French finance minister, clashed last year on social media with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with Donald Trump in the months leading up to the U.S. election.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s powerful executive branch and which supervises tech regulation in Europe, said that it “strongly condemns the U.S. decision to impose travel restrictions” and that it has requested clarification about the move. French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned it.\n\n“If needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures,” the commission said in a statement, without elaborating.\n\nRubio wrote in an X post on Tuesday that “for far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship,” he posted.\n\nThe European Commission countered that “the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.”\n\n“Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination,” it said.\n\nMacron said that the visa restrictions “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,” he posted on X.\n\nMacron said that the EU’s digital rules were adopted by “a democratic and sovereign process” involving all member countries and the European Parliament. He said that the rules “ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country.”\n\nHe underlined that “the rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe.”\n\nBreton and the group of Europeans fell afoul of a new visa policy announced in May to restrict the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for censorship of protected speech in the United States.\n\nThe four others are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index.\n\nRubio said the five had advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the United States.\n\nThe action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or penalties.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Sarah Rogers, the U.S. under secretary of state for public diplomacy, called Breton the “mastermind” behind the EU’s Digital Services Act, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. This includes flagging harmful or illegal content like hate speech.\n\nBreton responded on X by noting that all 27 EU member countries voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he wrote.\n\nAngela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin woman who almost killed her sixth-grade classmate to please the fictional horror villain known as Slender Man was ordered back to a state psychiatric hospital Tuesday after she escaped from her group home last month.\n\nWaukesha County Circuit Judge K. Scott Wagner granted a state Department of Health Services request to revoke 23-year-old Morgan Geyser’s release privileges. Geyser told the judge through her attorney, Tony Cotton, last week that she would not fight revocation. Wagner then approved the request during a short hearing.\n\nCotton didn't immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.\n\nGeyser and her friend Anissa Weier lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a Waukesha park in 2014. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier cheered her on. A passing bicyclist discovered Leutner, who barely survived. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.\n\nGeyser and Weier later told investigators they attacked Leutner in hopes of impressing Slender Man enough that he would make them his servants and wouldn't hurt their families. Both of them were eventually committed to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute — Geyser for 40 years and Weier for 25 years.\n\nWeier earned conditional release in 2021. Wagner granted Geyser conditional release this past September despite warnings from state Department of Health Services officials that she couldn't be trusted.\n\nGeyser was placed in a Madison group home. Authorities say that on Nov. 22 she cut off her GPS monitor and fled the state with a 43-year-old companion. Police arrested both of them the next day at a truck stop outside Chicago, about 170 miles (274 kilometers) south of Madison.\n\nGeyser's companion told WKOW-TV that the two of them became friends at church and had been seeing each other daily for the last month. Geyser decided to escape because she was afraid the group home would no longer allow them to see each other, the companion said.\n\nSlender Man was created online by Eric Knudsen in 2009 as a mysterious figure photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He grew into a popular boogeyman, appearing in video games, online stories and a 2018 movie.",
