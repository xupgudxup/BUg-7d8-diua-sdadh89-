    "fullText": "U.S. citizens in Russia are urged to leave immediately as the State Department reissued its highest-level warning against traveling to the country.\n\nIn an update issued Dec. 29, 2025,State Department the U.S. State Department said Russia remains under a “Level 4: Do Not Travel” advisory due to dangers associated with the continuing war between Russia and Ukraine. The risk of harassment or wrongful detention, arbitrary enforcement of local laws and the possibility of terrorism were also cited.\n\nAmericans who are in Russia are advised to leave immediately.\n\n“The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has reduced its staff. The Russian government has also restricted travel for embassy personnel. All U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services,” the State Department said in its warning.\n\nViolence is a continual threat in the country, officials warned.\n\nThere have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg and other large cities and, in 2024, ISIS Khorasan claimed responsibility for an attack at Crocus Music Hall in Moscow that killed 130 people. Places of worship have also been targeted.\n\nU.S. citizens could also become victims of harassment, mistreatment and extortion.\n\n“Russian officials have questioned, threatened, and detained U.S. citizens without reason. This includes both former and current U.S. government and military personnel, as well as private U.S. citizens. Russian authorities have a history of wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals and using them as bargaining chips,” the State Department warned.\n\nOther counties on the State Department’s “Do Not Travel” list include Afghanistan, Belarus, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Niger, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Ukraine.\n\nIf you must travel to Russia, the State Department has a list of safety precautions. You can see those here.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Imran Ahmed says US companies are ‘corrupting the system’ of politics by seeking to avoid accountability\n\nA British anti-disinformation campaigner told by the Trump administration that he faces possible removal from the US has said he is being targeted by arrogant and “sociopathic” tech companies for trying to hold them to account.\n\nImran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), is among five European nationals barred from the US by the state department after being accused of seeking to push tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nAhmed lives lawfully in Washington DC with his American wife and daughter, meaning he is at risk of deportation. Late on Thursday a court granted him a temporary restraining order to block any attempt to remove him from the US or detain him.\n\nAhmed told the Guardian he believed he had been singled out for his work seeking greater accountability and transparency for social media and AI firms, which has led to Elon Musk’s X unsuccessfully suing CCDH.\n\nAhmed, who is a friend of Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, said it was another attempt to deflect accountability and transparency.\n\n“This has never been about politics,” he said, adding that his organisation had worked successfully with the first Trump administration and would do so again if asked.\n\n“What it has been about is companies that simply do not want to be held accountable and, because of the influence of big money in Washington, are corrupting the system and trying to bend it to their will, and their will is to be unable to be held accountable,” he said.\n\n“There is no other industry, that acts with such arrogance, indifference and a lack of humility and sociopathic greed at the expense of people.”\n\nAs well as Ahmed, the state department has barred the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accused the five people of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.\n\nSarah Rogers, an official at the state department, posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”\n\nThe sanctions are being seen as the latest attack on European regulations that target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have said the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.\n\nAhmed, who began his career working with Labour politicians in Westminster, said he had not yet formally received any notification from the US government, and that he believed its case against him was unfounded. “I’m very confident that our first amendment rights will be upheld by the court,” he said.\n\nThe next court hearing, due on Monday, is expected to confirm the protective order that prevents the US government from detaining him, said Ahmed, who spent Christmas away from his wife and infant daughter amid the legal battle.\n\nHe said this was “a rational thing for us to do, given that in every other case to date where someone has had a green card withdrawn in the last few months, they have been arrested and detained and often spirited hundreds or thousands of miles away from their friends, family and support networks.”\n\nThe CCDH has previously angered Musk over reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took it over. Musk tried unsuccessfully to sue the CCDH last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”.\n\nMore recently, the CCDH released a report warning about harmful answers produced by the latest version of ChatGPT when asked about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.\n\n“We’ve seen that social media and AI companies are increasingly under pressure as a result of organisations like mine,” Ahmed said. “No one likes being exposed as mendacious or hypocritical, but they call their friends in government or they call their pitbull litigation lawyers and start suing.”\n\nAhmed said it was particularly jarring to be targeted given that hate speech and misinformation was increasingly a bipartisan issue, raised as a concern by some Republican politicians as well as Democrats.\n\nHe said he was nonetheless ready to respond with a swift legal response when he heard the news. “When you take on the world’s biggest corporations and when you’ve had the experiences we’ve had, being sued by the world’s richest man, you dissociate and compartmentalise immediately.”\n\nThere had been a cost already, he said. “Nothing I’m going through compares to any of the parents I sit with who’ve lost their children,” Ahmed said. “I chose to take on the biggest companies in the world, to hold them accountable, to speak truth to power. There is a cost attached to that. My family understands that.\n\n“The only time I felt any sadness at all is last night when my wife told me that our child said her sixth word, and then I cried a bit.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, those targeted will generally be barred from entering the US, and some may face removal proceedings if already in the country.\n\nRubio did not name those targeted, but under secretary for public diplomacy Sarah Rogers identified them on X, accusing the individuals of “fomenting censorship of American speech”.\n\nThe five named were: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index’; and former EU commissioner Breton.\n\nThe visa bans come after the administration’s National Security Strategy this month said European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk “civilisational erasure” for the continent.\n\nRogers called Breton – who served as the European Commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024 – “a mastermind” of the DSA.\n\nMelford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), said in a video posted online in 2024 that she co-founded the organisation “to try to break the business model of harmful online content” by reviewing online news websites to allow advertisers to “choose whether or not they want to fund content that is polarising and divisive and harmful, or whether they want to steer their advertising back towards more quality journalism.”\n\nA spokesperson for GDI called the US action “immoral, unlawful, and un-American” and “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”\n\nMost Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don’t necessarily need visas to come into the US. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.\n\nWith Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive on Wednesday warned that it would take action against any “unjustified measures” after the U.S. State Department barred five Europeans it accuses of pressuring U.S. technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nThe Europeans were characterized by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations. They include the former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton.\n\nBreton, a businessman and former French finance minister, clashed last year on social media with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with Donald Trump in the months leading up to the U.S. election.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s powerful executive branch and which supervises tech regulation in Europe, said that it “strongly condemns the U.S. decision to impose travel restrictions” and that it has requested clarification about the move. French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned it.\n\n“If needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures,” the commission said in a statement, without elaborating.\n\nRubio wrote in an X post on Tuesday that “for far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship,” he posted.\n\nThe European Commission countered that “the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.”\n\n“Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination,” it said.\n\nMacron said that the visa restrictions “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,” he posted on X.\n\nMacron said that the EU’s digital rules were adopted by “a democratic and sovereign process” involving all member countries and the European Parliament. He said that the rules “ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country.”\n\nHe underlined that “the rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe.”\n\nBreton and the group of Europeans fell afoul of a new visa policy announced in May to restrict the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for censorship of protected speech in the United States.\n\nThe four others are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index.\n\nRubio said the five had advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the United States.\n\nThe action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or penalties.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Sarah Rogers, the U.S. under secretary of state for public diplomacy, called Breton the “mastermind” behind the EU’s Digital Services Act, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. This includes flagging harmful or illegal content like hate speech.\n\nBreton responded on X by noting that all 27 EU member countries voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he wrote.\n\nAngela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin woman who almost killed her sixth-grade classmate to please the fictional horror villain known as Slender Man was ordered back to a state psychiatric hospital Tuesday after she escaped from her group home last month.\n\nWaukesha County Circuit Judge K. Scott Wagner granted a state Department of Health Services request to revoke 23-year-old Morgan Geyser’s release privileges. Geyser told the judge through her attorney, Tony Cotton, last week that she would not fight revocation. Wagner then approved the request during a short hearing.\n\nCotton didn't immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.\n\nGeyser and her friend Anissa Weier lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a Waukesha park in 2014. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier cheered her on. A passing bicyclist discovered Leutner, who barely survived. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.\n\nGeyser and Weier later told investigators they attacked Leutner in hopes of impressing Slender Man enough that he would make them his servants and wouldn't hurt their families. Both of them were eventually committed to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute — Geyser for 40 years and Weier for 25 years.\n\nWeier earned conditional release in 2021. Wagner granted Geyser conditional release this past September despite warnings from state Department of Health Services officials that she couldn't be trusted.\n\nGeyser was placed in a Madison group home. Authorities say that on Nov. 22 she cut off her GPS monitor and fled the state with a 43-year-old companion. Police arrested both of them the next day at a truck stop outside Chicago, about 170 miles (274 kilometers) south of Madison.\n\nGeyser's companion told WKOW-TV that the two of them became friends at church and had been seeing each other daily for the last month. Geyser decided to escape because she was afraid the group home would no longer allow them to see each other, the companion said.\n\nSlender Man was created online by Eric Knudsen in 2009 as a mysterious figure photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He grew into a popular boogeyman, appearing in video games, online stories and a 2018 movie.",
