    "description": "30 years of Windows widgets - from Active Desktop to the Widget Board. Six implementations, six deaths, and the scar tissue that shapes the platform you'd build on today.",
    "fullText": "The full history of Windows widgets, from 1997 to today.\n\nEvery constraint you'll hit today exists because of a specific past disaster.\n\nMicrosoft has been trying to solve the same UX problem since 1997: how to surface live information without making you launch an app. They've shipped six different implementations across nearly 30 years. Each one died from a different fundamental flaw - performance, security, screen space, privacy, engagement. And each death triggered the same reflex: containment.\n\nThe pattern goes like this. Microsoft releases widgets into the wild. Users or attackers find the breaking point. Microsoft panics, kills the feature, and ships the next version locked inside a tighter box. Active Desktop splashed HTML across the wallpaper - performance collapsed, so Vista contained widgets in a rigid sidebar. Users hated losing screen space, so Windows 7 freed gadgets to float anywhere - then a security exploit blew the whole platform apart. Windows 8 responded by locking widgets into a full-screen Start Screen nobody wanted. The cycle repeats: build, ship, backlash, kill, rebuild with more walls.\n\nUnderstanding why each containment failed tells you exactly what constraints shape the platform you'd build on today. Every design decision in the current architecture - the declarative Adaptive Cards format, the native WinUI 3 renderer, the overlay-instead-of-dock layout - exists because of a specific past disaster. The constraints you'll hit when building widgets today aren't arbitrary. They're scar tissue.\n\nInternet Explorer 4.0 shipped in 1997 with a component called the Windows Desktop Update. It fused the Trident rendering engine into explorer.exe, turning the Windows wallpaper from a static bitmap into a live HTML surface. Microsoft called it Active Desktop.\n\nThe most visible piece was the Active Channel Bar - a vertical strip docked to the right edge of the screen, populated with branded buttons for Disney, MSNBC, Warner Bros, and CNN. Each button represented a \"Channel,\" a website that pushed content to your machine for offline reading. The backbone was Channel Definition Format (CDF), an XML standard that told your PC which pages to download and when.\n\nA small red sparkle called the \"Gleam\" appeared on a channel's icon when new content arrived. It was an early attempt at the notification patterns we now take for granted. The handpicked channel lineup drew antitrust complaints, but the real killer was more mundane.\n\nPentium I/II processors with 16–32 MB of RAM buckled under a constantly running HTML renderer. Because Trident was fused into the shell, a crash in Active Desktop crashed all of explorer.exe. Users saw a white HTML recovery screen where their wallpaper should have been. Disk I/O from background syncs ground hard drives to a halt, degrading everything else running on the machine.\n\n\"Disable Active Desktop\" became the top tuning tip for Windows 98.\n\nMicrosoft had discovered its first widget lesson: ambient information cannot cost performance.\n\nThe widget concept went dormant during the XP years, then resurfaced inside the troubled \"Longhorn\" project. The original 2002 vision was ambitious - a translucent sidebar meant to replace the system tray entirely. After Longhorn collapsed and was reset in 2004, the scope shrank. What shipped with Windows Vista in January 2007 was a supplementary pane: a dark, semi-transparent strip running the full height of the right edge of the screen.\n\nThe sidebar was a showcase for Aero Glass. The default clock gadget had a sweeping red second hand behind a reflective glass face. The CPU meter mimicked luxury car dashboard dials - metallic bezels, needles that jittered physically as load spiked, turning red as they approached 100%. Eleven gadgets shipped in total, and thousands more followed.\n\nThe problem was physical. Most monitors in 2007 were 4:3 or 5:4, and the sidebar permanently consumed around 150 pixels of horizontal space. On a 1280x1024 display, that's over 10% of your workspace. Power users disabled it on day one. The sidebar.exe process compounded the issue - it leaked memory steadily, consuming 50–100 MB on systems where 1 GB of RAM was the minimum spec.\n\nMicrosoft had attempted containment: give widgets a fixed home, keep things tidy. But rigid docking doesn't work when screen space is scarce.\n\nWindows 7 freed the gadgets. Microsoft dropped the sidebar container entirely, renamed the feature Desktop Gadgets, and let users drag widgets anywhere on screen. Gadgets snapped magnetically to screen edges and to each other. A new \"Aero Peek\" button in the taskbar made all windows transparent on hover, so you could glance at your gadgets without minimizing your work.\n\nThe third-party ecosystem exploded. DeviantArt and WinCustomize communities produced GPU temperature monitors, Winamp remote controls, elaborate calendar suites. It was the golden age of desktop customization.\n\nIt was also a security catastrophe hiding in plain sight.\n\nDesktop gadgets ran as HTML Applications with full local machine trust. No sandbox. A gadget could read files, write to the registry, and execute system commands.\n\nIn July 2012, at Black Hat in Las Vegas, researchers Mickey Shkatov and Toby Kohlenberg presented \"We Have You By The Gadgets.\" The attack chain was elegant and devastating: intercept the HTTP traffic of a weather gadget on a shared network, inject JavaScript into the XML data stream, use that JavaScript to instantiate an ActiveX control like WScript.Shell, then execute arbitrary code on the target machine. A weather widget became a backdoor.\n\n▶ Black Hat 2012: \"We Have You By The Gadgets\" - the presentation that killed Desktop Gadgets.\n\nThe researchers also demonstrated a distribution vector - since .gadget files were just renamed ZIPs, an attacker could package a trojan inside a seemingly innocent clock skin. Users would install it without triggering antivirus warnings, because the code executed within the trusted sidebar.exe process.\n\nMicrosoft's response was nuclear. By the time Windows 8 launched in October 2012, the entire gadget engine was ripped from the codebase. Freedom without a sandbox was a death sentence. Everything Microsoft built after this moment was shaped by the security lesson. The move to declarative Adaptive Cards - JSON that describes a UI, never executes code - exists because of Black Hat 2012.\n\nWindows 8 made a radical bet: tiles ARE the launcher. The Start Menu disappeared, replaced by a full-screen Start Screen - a grid of rectangular tiles that doubled as widgets. When \"live,\" a tile flipped or slid to reveal content: unread email counts, weather forecasts, news headlines.\n\nThe technology was elegant. Apps pushed tiny XML payloads through Windows Notification Services (WNS) to update their tiles without running a background process. Battery impact was near zero. Developers chose from a predefined catalog of XML templates - TileWideSmallImageAndText03 and friends - which enforced visual consistency but prevented any custom layout.\n\nThe user experience was a disaster. On a desktop PC, checking your weather tile meant leaving your work, entering the full-screen Start Screen, then navigating back. That context switch enraged productivity users. Enterprise customers called it a dealbreaker.\n\nThere was a deeper problem. Tiles were read-only. You couldn't check off a to-do, pause a song, or reply to a message from the tile. Clicking always launched the full app. Compared to the interactive gadgets of Windows 7 - where you could type notes, adjust sliders, and control media players directly on the desktop - this felt like a clear regression.\n\nWindows 10 tried a compromise - tiles went back into a traditional Start Menu. But third-party developers never invested in WNS backends. Building a live tile meant setting up a cloud service to format XML payloads and push them through Microsoft's notification infrastructure - a nontrivial cost for a feature most users barely noticed. By 2020, Start Menus were filled with static, lifeless squares. When Windows 11 launched in 2021, Live Tiles were gone.\n\nContainment attempt number two, even more extreme than Vista's sidebar. Widgets must live alongside your work, not in a separate universe.\n\nBefore the current Widget Board, Microsoft tried two half-measures.\n\nCortana Cards (2015–2020) were the most capable widgets Microsoft ever shipped. The assistant scraped your email for flight confirmations and showed gate info. It read your calendar and estimated commute times. It tracked packages automatically. It surfaced sports scores for teams you followed, restaurant suggestions based on your location, and weather forecasts tuned to your daily routine. Users managed these through a settings panel called the \"Notebook,\" where they explicitly declared their interests.\n\nAll of this required deep access to your email, location, and calendar data. Users saw a company reading their emails. Most disabled Cortana entirely.\n\nThe catch: disabling Cortana left the dashboard empty - a blank panel with nothing to show. In May 2020, Microsoft pivoted Cortana to a productivity chatbot and removed the cards.\n\nNews and Interests (April 2021) took a simpler approach - a weather icon on the Windows 10 taskbar that expanded into a news flyout on hover. The hover trigger was the problem. Users moving their mouse toward the system tray accidentally opened a panel of headlines. IT administrators scrambled to disable it via Group Policy. The feature was labeled bloatware within weeks of launch.\n\n▶ News and Interests - the accidental hover trigger that got it labeled bloatware within weeks.\n\nBoth attempts proved a consistent pattern: users want glanceable information but reject anything that feels invasive or disruptive. These two failures directly shaped what came next.\n\nWindows 11 shipped in October 2021 with a dedicated Widgets Board - a panel that slides out from the left edge of the screen when you press Win + W or click the weather icon on the taskbar. The board is an overlay, not a docked sidebar, so it claims zero permanent screen space.\n\nThe Widget Board rendered everything through Edge WebView2, the Chromium-based web control shipped as part of the Windows Web Experience Pack. Widget providers implemented the IWidgetProvider COM interface and defined their UI using Adaptive Cards - a JSON format that describes layout declaratively. No executable code, no scripts. The host parses data, never runs it. This eliminated the entire class of remote code execution attacks that killed Desktop Gadgets in 2012. But the rendering was still web-based. Users could see msedgewebview2.exe processes in Task Manager when the board opened, often consuming hundreds of megabytes of RAM.\n\nMicrosoft opened the board to third-party developers in 2023. Spotify added playback controls. Facebook Messenger shows recent conversations. Phone Link surfaces mobile notifications. Xbox Game Pass highlights new releases. Unlike Live Tiles, these widgets are interactive - you can pause a track, check a box, or reply to a message without leaving the board. For web developers, the PWA widget path is the most accessible entry point. Define widgets in your web app manifest, and they appear natively on the board. No Win32 code, no UWP packaging - your existing web stack works. That low barrier to entry is a deliberate correction from the Live Tiles era, where standing up a WNS backend cost more effort than most developers were willing to spend.\n\nThe architecture was secure - sandboxed web content can't touch your file system. But the WebView2 rendering layer, the forced MSN news feed, and the lack of user control over the board's content drew persistent criticism. Something had to change.\n\nIn mid-2024, Microsoft began rebuilding the board. The forcing function was the EU's Digital Markets Act, which required Microsoft to open the Widget Board to third-party feed providers in the European Economic Area. To comply, Microsoft separated the MSN content pipeline into a replaceable Store-updatable component - the Microsoft Start Experiences app - making it one feed provider among many rather than a hardwired default. The compliance overhaul gave Microsoft the opportunity to rebuild the rendering layer too: widget rendering moved from WebView2 to native WinUI 3.\n\nAdaptive Card JSON now maps directly to WinUI 3 XAML controls: a TextBlock in your card becomes an actual Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.TextBlock on screen. Widgets inherit Fluent Design theming, high-contrast modes, and accessibility automatically. The memory footprint dropped - a native WinUI 3 control is far lighter than a DOM element inside a Chromium instance.\n\nThe latest evolution arrived in early 2026: Lock Screen widgets. Weather, sports scores, and traffic now appear before you log in. Third-party apps can participate too. It's a full conceptual circle back to the \"glance and go\" vision that started this story in 1997 - except now the hardware can handle it, the sandbox keeps it safe, and the user stays in control. Microsoft appears to have realized that widgets shouldn't compete with applications for desktop space. They belong in the liminal moments of computing - the glance before you unlock, the pause between tasks.\n\nWith 250+ million monthly active Windows users, the potential reach for widget developers is enormous. Whether the platform delivers depends on how Microsoft navigates the tensions that killed every previous attempt.\n\nThe current Widget Board is the scar tissue made manifest. Declarative JSON with no executable code (security). Native WinUI 3 rendering, migrated off the original WebView2 pipeline (performance). An overlay, not a dock (screen space). Interactive widgets (engagement). Opt-in data access (privacy). Every lesson encoded in architecture.\n\nBut it's not perfect. The developer API has constraints that limit what you can build. The discoverability problem - most Windows users have never pressed Win + W - remains unsolved. And while the news feed is finally optional, the tension between Microsoft's desire to monetize the Discover surface and users' desire for a clean utility board is far from resolved.\n\nThose constraints, and how to work within them to ship something useful, are what the rest of this series will cover.",

    "title": "The Windows PC is dying, thanks to cloud-based services and AI",
    "description": "The rise of AI tools and services has added a new twist to the decline and fall of standalone Windows PCs.",
    "fullText": "For years, I’ve been watching the slow evolution of classic Windows PCs into cloud-based Windows and Office services. Sure, you can still buy a PC with Windows on it, but you’re not really “buying” Windows as much as renting it.\n\nWindows cloud PCs have gone from Microsoft’s side project to the centerpiece of its post‑Windows‑10 strategy. But the story in 2026 is less “death of the PC” and more “merger of PC, cloud, and AI under Microsoft’s terms.” Today, the most interesting question is not whether Windows moves to the cloud, but how much local control users are willing to surrender in exchange for AI‑infused desktops.\n\nFor the longest time, Microsoft had planned on the Windows 365 Cloud PC to shift users from a PC‑centric world to Desktop‑as‑a‑Service, with Windows 11 acting as the on‑ramp. Microsoft’s own internal slideware later made that explicit: the plan is to “move Windows 11 increasingly to the cloud… to enable a full Windows operating system streamed from the cloud to any device.” What started as the Business and Enterprise editions of Windows 365, running on Azure with per‑user monthly pricing in the $30-to-$60 range, has since been productized and polished as if it were the “real” Windows roadmap rather than a side hustle.\n\nOther harbingers included Windows 365 Boot, which bypassed the local operating system entirely and dropped you straight into a personalized cloud desktop on shared or BYOD hardware. And Windows 365 Switch blurs the boundary between local and hosted sessions, turning a cloud PC into “just another desktop.”\n\nAt the same time, Windows App enables you to run Azure Virtual Desktop, Windows 365, Microsoft Dev Box, Remote Desktop Services, and remote PCs from, well, pretty much any computing device. Specifically, you can use Windows App to run Windows on Macs, iPhones, iPads, other Windows machines, even in web browsers. That last means you can now run Windows on Linux-powered PCs, Chromebooks, and Android phones and tablets.\n\nHeck, you can even run Windows using a Meta Quest VR headset!\n\nA funny thing happened on the way to this cloud-based subscription service. AI came along. Microsoft, which has gone whole-hog into AI — if I see one more Copilot tie-in, I’m going to scream — decided that AI PCs would be the future. It’s wrong.\n\nAs Kevin Terwilliger, Dell’s head of product, said of PC customers, “They’re not buying based on AI. I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them.” (Ya think?)\n\nThat’s not to say people aren’t using AI. They are. But, no one’s managed to sell them yet on the idea of agentic AI PCs, even with the special sauce of Neural Processing Units (NPUs), Intel Panther Lake chips, and super-duper GPUs. Most analysts, and at least one cranky Computerworld columnist (guess who), think the Copilot+ PC hype needs to end.\n\nJeff Bezos — remember him? he knows a thing or two about the cloud — suggested that the PC is never going to be able to deliver the AI goods. Instead, “AI will be in everything,” but compute will be delivered via the cloud. In case you missed it, at the last Ignite conference, Microsoft highlighted its Windows 365 cloud PC concept, with AI agents, not AI PCs.\n\nGoing forward, Microsoft will want you not to buy and run your own applications, AI-infused or not, on a PC. They’ll want you to subscribe and run “your” AI-enabled programs on their cloud services.\n\nThis will not be cheap. Today, the bottom-end Windows 365 Cloud PC with 2 virtual CPUs, 4GB RAM, and 64GB of storage will cost you $28 a month. Good luck running Windows 11 on its own, never mind with any application, on 4 gigs of RAM. The absolute minimum for a useful cloud desktop with 8GB of RAM is $41. Add in AI functionality, an instance of Office, and you’re talking real money.\n\nFor companies, math is being reframed. Instead of comparing Windows 365 to the sunk cost of a once‑every‑five‑years PC purchase, vendors pitch it against the fully burdened price of securing, patching, and managing a distributed fleet in a hybrid‑work world. In that context, a per‑seat cloud desktop subscription stops looking like a weird outlier and just another SKU on the Microsoft subscription treadmill.\n\nI’m old enough to recall the transition from centralized computers you used via a terminal to the locally owned PC revolution. Then, we controlled the “horizontal and the vertical.” The AI-enabled cloud desktop puts Microsoft in charge of the entire application stack and your online identity.\n\nIt might be 2026, but Microsoft’s business model going forward looks a lot like the ones I saw in 1976. Maybe you’re comfortable with that. I’m not.\n\nMicrosoft frames Windows 365 as the sane way to keep corporate data off home PCs shared with kids and games, which is hard to argue with if you are a CSO signing audit reports. But the shift to cloud PCs plus on‑device AI also deepens lock‑in. Sure, you can run Windows 365 from anything, but it runs best when paired with Windows 11 hardware.\n\nThe old Windows desktop is dying. The 2026 twist is that its successor does not live only in Microsoft’s cloud. It also lives on your desk, in your laptop, and in the NPU you did not ask for, all stitched together into a Windows that is becoming less an operating system and more a metered utility.\n\nMe? You know my bias. If you want control over your privacy, your data, how much you’re paying for compute, and your PC, Linux is the best way forward.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nQuestion: do sleep with your bedroom door open or closed at night? If you shut it, and you're constantly waking up through the night, then leaving it open instead could be the instant solution to your frequent wake-ups.\n\nYes, scientists are saying that sleeping in an unventilated room leads to an increase in levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), which leads to broken and disrupted sleep. \n\nTo learn more, I spoke to mold and air quality expert and founder of HomeCleanse Michael Rubino, and to Dr. William Lu, MD, a sleep medicine physician.\n\nHere these certified experts explain what happens to the air we breathe when we're sleeping in an unventilated room, and what that means for our sleep.\n\nExperts maintain that sleeping with your bedroom door closed won't lead to CO2 poisoning\n\nHowever, sleeping in an unventilated bedroom can cause CO2 levels to rapidly increase, leading to sleep disturbances\n\nCigarette smoke, candles and incense sticks also release CO2, contributing to rising levels of the gas\n\nHere in the northern hemisphere it’s the middle of winter, which often means freezing nighttime temperatures. So it makes sense to close up your windows and doors in a bid to stay cozy at night. \n\nHowever, by removing the ventilation in your bedroom you are effectively creating a CO2 bubble, warn experts. That’s because when we breathe, we breathe in oxygen and exhale CO2. \n\n\"If the bedroom door is closed, you’re usually cutting down air exchange,\" explains Michael, who is also Chair of the Change the Air Foundation, a non profit organization that promotes safer indoor air quality for everyone.\n\n\"The bedroom becomes its own little 'air bubble.' That matters because the air in that room changes over the night,\" says Michael. \"You’re exhaling CO2 for hours.\" \n\nAs well as increased levels of CO2, moisture from your breath builds up, which can lead to mold growth (investing in one for the best dehumidifiers will help with this).\n\nPlus, any VOCs from furniture, bedding, fragrances, candles, cleaning residues will linger for longer in a closed room, with evidence suggesting that this, along with rising CO2 levels, can also impact sleep quality.\n\nIf CO2 is high, it usually means the room isn’t getting enough fresh air for the number of people in it\n\nMichael Rubino, indoor air quality expert\n\nAs the source of increasing levels of CO2 is our breathing, levels can rise quicker than we expect, especially over the course of a night's sleep,says Michael. The size of your bedroom and the number of people sleeping in it can also impact the rise that CO2 rises.\n\nThere is some research to suggest that overnight CO2 levels can land in the 1,620 to 3,300ppm range under low-ventilation conditions. However, these levels are show to drop below 1,000ppm when ventilation is increased.\n\nMichael emphasizes that the levels of CO2 indicated above aren't cause for alarm, but they should prompt you to improve your air circulation. \n\n\"Just to be clear, the CO2 levels we’re talking about in most bedrooms aren’t 'you’re being poisoned,'\" says Michael. \"CO2 is mainly a clue. If it’s high, it usually means the room isn’t getting enough fresh air for the number of people breathing in it.\"\n\nClosing the bedroom door behind you is probably one of the last things you do before climbing into bed. However, sleeping in an unventilated bedroom leads to increased levels of CO2, which scientific research indicates can disturb your sleep.\n\nWhen carbon dioxide levels increase, our sleep often becomes lighter and more fragmented\n\nDr William Lu, sleep medicine physician\n\n“When carbon dioxide levels increase, our sleep often becomes lighter and more fragmented,” explains Dr Lu, a Medical Director at digital sleep clinic Dreem Health.\n\n“You are not likely to have trouble falling asleep, but it is likely you will get less deep, restorative sleep.\"\n\nStudies suggest that increased levels of CO2 in the air can translate to higher levels of CO2 in our bloodstream.\n\n“As there is an element of carbon dioxide homeostasis in our bodies, the response to the carbon dioxide elevation can be less deep sleep, more light sleep, and more awakenings,” continues the sleep medicine physician.\n\nIn contrast, sleeping in a well ventilated bedroom means you can achieve deeper, more restful sleep, with fewer bouts of waking up at night.\n\n“A well-ventilated bedroom helps keep our carbon dioxide levels steady and supports the body’s carbon dioxide homeostasis level,” says Dr Lu. “This becomes an improved environment conducive to more restorative sleep.”\n\nOpening your bedroom door or window, even just ajar to allow in a steady flow of fresh air, is the obvious step to improving the ventilation of your bedroom. \n\nHowever, as Michael acknowledges, that's not always an option for everyone. \"A closed door can be a fire safety benefit. So I don’t treat this like 'door open is always best.' I treat it like: if you sleep with the door closed, you should be more intentional about how the room gets fresh air,\" he explains.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s three other ways to reduce CO2 levels of your bedroom for better sleep.\n\nBedroom burping is a slightly repulsive term but essentially describes the practice of ventilating your bedroom for a 5-10 minute period. In Germany, they call this practice ‘luften’, which means to air out. \n\nRegardless of what you call it, opening your bedroom window wide before going to bed, even in the middle of winter, allows fresh air to flood your bedroom and forces stale air to leave. \n\nPockets of shock ventilation like the above is especially important during the winter months, during which time most of us have our bedrooms sealed tight for warmth. This results in CO2 levels rising throughout the day.\n\nCO2 levels increase steadily while we sleep, as we exhale it when breathing. However, there are other contributors of rising CO2 levels in the bedroom, which includes any product or appliance that burns fuel. \n\nThese could be candles or incense sticks, which release CO2 when burnt. What’s more, these products likely contain harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can harm your respiratory health. \n\n\"Plug-ins, heavily scented sprays, candles, incense, even strong laundry fragrance sitting in bedding. If someone is already sleeping poorly and the room is under-ventilated, adding more scent or smoke is not doing them any favors,\" says Michael.\n\nSo, unless you can open your door or window while burning them, hold off on the candles and incense sticks before bed.\n\nIn order to keep CO2 levels down while you sleep, air needs to be able to move in and out of your bedroom. Opening the door or window, even just a crack, provides much needed ventilation. \n\nIf security is an issue, consider a door chain for safety. Or, alternatively, look at products such as a window restrictor. These lock your window open but at a reduced angle. \n\n\"If the door stays closed, fine. Just make sure the room still has a way to move air,\" concludes Michael.\n\n\"Sometimes that’s simple clearance under the door. Other times it’s a properly designed transfer opening. The point is not the hardware. The point is that air has to be able to move through the room, not just sit in it.\"\n\nFollow Tom's Guide on Google News and add us as a preferred source to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.",

    "fullText": "New RADV Code Can Deliver 10x Faster Ray-Tracing Pipeline Compilation For Some Games\n\nA new merge request opened today for Mesa's Radeon Vulkan driver \"RADV\" by Valve contractor Natalie Vock provides another significant boost for the Vulkan ray-tracing performance in multiple titles.\r\nOver the past year RADV ray-tracing performance improved a lot as one of the lingering areas where RADV remained behind the now defunct AMDVLK driver and where NVIDIA has long had a performance advantage with ray-traced games. Already this year there have been some nice performance improvements while another exciting merge request is pending for bringing more gains.\r\nThe key takeaway for AMD Radeon Linux gamers with today's pull request:\r\n\"Compiling RT pipelines in UE4 games with raytracing (e.g. Ghostwire Tokyo, The Callisto Protocol) becomes 10 times faster. Yes, an order of magnitude! In one Ghostwire Tokyo Fossilize capture I gathered, time to replay went from 4 minutes and 20 seconds to just 20 seconds. These UE games also tended to have quite terrible stuttering whenever a new RT pipeline was compiled. That stuttering is gone completely.\"\r\nThe merge request now uses function calls to separate out any-hit/intersection shader compilation. Function calls for ray-tracing are now used for \"really cool stuff\" in building off this now-merged code that hit Mesa Git earlier today.\r\nNatalie Vock added in today's new merge request:\r\n\"On top of that, runtime performance improves by a lot [in affected applications] as well. Who knew that inlining hundreds of shaders into an incredibly hot loop might be bad for performance?! From quick napkin math, I think the pure RT performance in Ghostwire Tokyo improves by over 2x. In any case, FPS goes from ~30 to ~40 on my 7900XTX.\r\nIt seems like with the MR, we roughly match Windows performance in the Ghostwire Tokyo scene I tested, as well. Performance improvements on different apps/non-UE4 titles may vary, but I'm pretty sure quite a few apps should benefit. (Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't, though. It only really uses 1 any-hit shader at the maximum and is therefore unaffected by this MR.)\"\r\nIt seems RADV is off to a really great 2026.\r\nThe code is now under review. With Mesa 26.0 code branching / feature freeze imminent, it might not be merged in time for this quarter's Mesa 26.0 release in which case it may not be found in a stable release until Mesa 26.1 in Q2.\n\n 1 Comment",

    "description": "Time to supercharge your Mac.",
    "fullText": "As someone who regularly switches between the Mac and PC, I really can't live without the PowerToys app on Windows. It adds little missing features that I really like on the Mac, like a Spotlight Search alternative, auto dark mode, screen awake, on-screen OCR (which lets you pull text from images), and more.\n\nBut the reverse is also true. When I'm on MacOS, I start to miss the little features and commands that I've been used to Windows having for decades now (I started using Windows in school, but was only exposed to macOS when I was in college).\n\nIt's the little things, like not being able to cut and paste files in Finder. And why must I accidentally open the Music app every time I press the play button? This is just the beginning.\n\nEnter Supercharge, a utility from prolific indie developer Sindre Sorhus. Think of it not as a single app, but as a Swiss army knife for your menu bar—a collection of micro-utilities designed to patch the specific usability holes that Apple has left open, many of which Microsoft has already plugged. The app offers an unlimited free trial (with a prompt to upgrade every 12 hours), or you can buy it outright for $18. It's also available as part of a Setapp subscription.\n\nThe Supercharge app works in two ways. The first is by giving you a set-and-forget settings menu. Secondly, it adds a menu bar app where you can quickly access small features on the fly.\n\nThe tweaks part, to me, is a lot more interesting. Once the app is installed, open the menu bar app and go to Settings. Go to the Tweaks tab and take some time to customize your Mac's behavior.\n\nThe Finder is where Supercharge shines, fixing legacy behaviors that have frustrated Windows switchers for years. The first thing I enabled was the \"Cut and Paste\" functionality. Finally, you can use Cmd+X to cut a file and Cmd+V to move it, eliminating the awkward Cmd+C followed by Cmd+Option+V dance required by default.\n\nBeyond moving files, the app allows you to enable the Option+N shortcut to instantly create a new text file in your current folder—another Windows muscle memory I've had for decades. Additional tweaks include toggling the Enter key to open a file instead of renaming it, and an option to show hidden files by default.\n\nApple's Mission Control provides a bird's-eye view of all your windows, but it's hardly interactive. Supercharge changes that by adding window management buttons directly to the overlay. You can now add dedicated Close, Minimize, and Quit buttons for every window inside Mission Control, helping you clear cluttered app windows in seconds, and in a fairly visual way.\n\nSupercharge also brings much-needed flexibility to the Dock, making it more like the taskbar on Windows or Linux. Enable the Click-to-Hide feature, and you can minimize or hide an app simply by clicking on the app icon. My favorite, though, is the option to open folders directly in the Finder from the Dock. You can also set Supercharge to add spacers to the Dock, and quit apps using the middle-click mouse button.\n\nPerhaps the most useful fix in the entire suite is the ability to stop Apple Music from launching automatically. This feature stops the app from popping up when you press Play on your keyboard or Bluetooth headphones. If you are a dedicated Spotify user or simply dislike it when your headphones accidentally wake up Apple Music, this feature alone makes a Supercharge installation worth it.\n\nThe Supercharge app includes several other quality-of-life improvements. The Notification Nuke feature allows you to set a global hotkey to instantly clear all notifications from Notification Center, acting as a panic button for focus. To prevent accidents, you can also enable Accidental Quit Prevention, which requires a double-press or a Shift + Cmd + Q combo to actually quit an application.\n\nThe second part of the equation here is the menu bar app. Here, you can add small missing features that usually require downloading separate apps. There are more than two dozen options. Go to Settings > General > Show Menu Items to see the whole list.\n\nHere, you can add options to quickly capture and copy any text from an image (or translate it). There are one-click options for hiding all windows, showing the desktop, quitting all apps except the current one, clearing all notifications, and more. There's also a simple Keep Awake feature that will keep your Mac active even when the screen is off.\n\nAnd there's also a simple default browser switcher built-in, though I prefer using Sindre's dedicated Default Browser app.",

    "description": "macOS 26 comes with an interesting (and frustrating) quirk.",
    "fullText": "Apple's latest crop of updates was met with a bit of a mixed reaction. While some users love the new Liquid Glass design across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, others decidedly do not—which is likely what led Apple to introduce a dedicated setting to control the intensity of the effect. I'm partial to it, but I understand for some users, it's a tad too much, especially if it makes certain UI elements more difficult to see.\n\nBut Liquid Glass isn't the only thing Apple users have complained about, especially with regards to macOS Tahoe. Mac users reported various problems with performance and stability across macOS 26.0 and macOS 26.1, and have criticized design choices like overly rounded corners. Myself, I held out on updating my M3 Pro Mac until macOS 26.2, where many of these issues appeared to be fixed, but my M1 iMac is still on macOS Sequoia for the time being. All that to say, macOS 26 hasn't had the smoothest start compared to some of Apple's previous Mac updates. If you've been noticing, for example, that your Mac's window management isn't as cooperative as it's been in the past, you're not alone. In fact, there seems to be a clear explanation for what's behind the issues.\n\nAs with other versions of macOS, you can resize and adjust your Mac apps' windows by clicking and dragging from the bottom corners. The issue, however, is that as of Apple's newest update, it can be fairly difficult to grab the corner of the window. You might, instead, find you click on the bottom corner of the app or website instead, leading to unintended actions. Clicking the top right corner of Chrome, for example, will drag the whole app window, rather than resize it. Clicking the bottom left corner and dragging will start to highlight everything in the app window instead, perhaps sending you all around the screen as well.\n\nIf you slowly hover your cursor over the corner of the window, eventually you'll find a spot that turns your cursor into a resize icon, and you'll know you're good to click and drag to resize. But why is this so much more difficult to do quickly than it was in macOS Sequoia or beyond?\n\nNorbert Heger, a software developer, seemingly has an answer. In a blog post on Sunday, Heger explains that those rounded corners Apple designed for Tahoe are having a negative impact on the clickable area of the window. With a square corner, most of the clickable area—Heger says 62% of it—lies within the corner of the window itself. That gives users a relatively large area to click within the corner in order to grab onto the window, and a little bit of room outside the window to click, as well. But these new rounded corners don't seem to take that into consideration. Instead, they're relying on the same click area as before, but because there's less corner to work with now, the actual clickable area of the window is far less. Heger says about 75% of the clickable area now exists outside the window itself, giving users just 25% to work with in the actual corner of the window.\n\nIf you're running macOS Tahoe, you can try this out for yourself right now: Move your cursor to the corner of the window, and wait for it to change into the resize icon. If you're hovering within the window itself, it won't change until you're just about to move outside the window. You can keep going a bit, and see you can get pretty darn far outside the window before the cursor changes back.\n\nThis seems like a relatively easy fix on Apple's part, assuming they're aware of the issue. Maybe a patch will even make it into macOS 26.3. That said, the company has not publicly acknowledged the quirk, so it's anyone's guess. Until a potential fix, those of us on macOS Tahoe will just need to retrain our muscle memories around window resizing. For anyone who hasn't upgraded yet, you can simply carry on as usual.",

Also not recognized.\n\nWindows Media Player - guess the album - Click to enlarge\n\nWe asked Microsoft if the service had indeed been retired or if there might be a reprieve or workaround, but we were met with equal indifference from the tech giant's PR organ.\n\nA message on a Reddit forum purporting to be a chat with a Microsoft support representative suggested that the servers have indeed been shut down, and that a third-party alternative should be sourced.\n\nAlternatively, customers can manually enter the information, like it's the 1990s all over again.\n\nThe timing is unfortunate. Tired of content vanishing from streaming services or disappearing into algorithmic feeds, consumers are returning to physical media like CDs.\n\nPhysical media drives have yet to completely disappear from Windows devices, but the default service used by Windows Media Player for album information, musicmatch-ssl.xboxlive.com, does not appear to serve up any metadata.\n\nWindows Media Player has a long history with Windows. First released as part of the Multimedia Extensions for Windows 3.0, it evolved over the years, gaining support for streaming, ripping, and burning CDs. It survived Microsoft's Zune experiment and remains in Windows 11 - though now branded \"Legacy\" as Microsoft pushes users toward its modern Media Player app.\n\nMicrosoft does not share its device telemetry, but it clearly concluded too few users still play CDs to justify maintaining the metadata services.\n\nApple's iTunes, on the other hand, recognized every CD we threw at it. ®",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have brought in some of the most legendary players ever to play the game, but they’ve also seen plenty of big names slip through their fingers during transfer windows.\n\nManchester United are linked with plenty of potential signings every year, and 2026 is no different.\n\nWith the January window open, United haven’t been quick to make any new signings. Ineos appears content to wait until summer for their main targets.\n\nThey missed out on Antoine Semenyo, who joined Manchester City earlier this week.\n\nIn midfield, Carlos Baleba was a failed target from Brighton and most of the other midfielders they are looking at aren’t available yet.\n\nIf anyone does end up leaving during the season, United may look to bring someone in. Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte have both been mentioned as potential departures as they look for more playing time ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nUnited have had several big near misses when it comes to transfers.\n\nFrom Wesley Sneijder and Thiago Alcantara to Ronaldinho and Patrick Kluivert, United have missed out on many top players down the years.\n\nJavier Zanetti, who spent 19 seasons with Inter Milan, has now shared his experience of turning down an approach from Sir Alex Ferguson. Speaking to the Daily Mail, the Argentina legend recalled:\n\n“We met at an airport,” said Zanetti. “He told me that he wanted me to go to Manchester United and I thanked him.”\n\n“Manchester United is one of the most important clubs in the world and Ferguson one of the most important coaches in the history of football,” he added. “But I told him that my footballing life would be through Inter, I wanted to play for them until the end of my career. And he understood that.”\n\nZanetti stayed loyal to Inter throughout his career, becoming a club icon much like how Ferguson valued loyalty within his own squads.\n\nZanetti won five consecutive Serie A titles with Inter from 2005/06 to 2009/10. The club also lifted the Champions League trophy in 2010 under Jose Mourinho, along with a FIFA Club World Cup title.\n\nMourinho clearly valued their time together too. When he picked his all-time best XI from players he’d managed, Zanetti was named as his right-back:\n\nZanetti ranks Mourinho highly among the managers he played for during his career.\n\nUnder Mourinho, Inter achieved a historic treble in 2010, featuring one of the strongest squads in the club’s history.\n\nWhen asked about Mourinho, Zanetti described him as one of the best he’d worked with.\n\nHe said: “We won everything with him but beyond winning it was his personality, his ability, his intelligence, his capacity as a coach. He was very important in my career.”",

    "description": "PowerToys really should come pre-installed for every Windows 11 user.",
    "fullText": "I'm someone who routinely switches between Mac and Windows. It's a hazard of being a tech writer. But the thing is, I'm so used to the user friendliness in macOS that whenever I shift to Windows mode, there are some hiccups. Windows tends to throw up walls where there really shouldn't be any. I used to just white-knuckle through it, but that was before I fully embraced PowerToys.\n\nPowerToys is a collection of utilities made by Microsoft itself. It's free to download on GitHub, or a myriad of other places, and unlike with Windows 11, Microsoft actually adds useful and interesting features to it every couple of weeks. You can download and install PowerToys from the GitHub page, the Microsoft Store, or using Windows Package Manager.\n\nHere are a few of PowerToys utilities that have become a must for me (after installing the app, you really should browse all that it offers to see what strikes your fancy). If you took them away, I wouldn't be sure how to use my Windows PC anymore—this thing should really come pre-installed.\n\nThese days, Windows Search can come across a little heavy and bloated, just like the Start menu. While it’s fine for opening apps once in a while, I can’t really use it for anything more than that. Plus, I’m a macOS user, so I’m used to Spotlight Search’s lightning-fast keyboard launcher. While you can use third-party keyboard launchers on Windows now (Raycast being the latest addition), my favorite option is actually Microsoft’s own keyboard launcher, the Command Palette that’s included in PowerToys.\n\nLike Spotlight Search, it’s light and fast, and you can assign any shortcut to it. I use it to quickly launch apps, search for files, and even search for open windows. Command Palette even has a really helpful Bookmarks feature that I use a lot. I’ve created bookmarks for quickly opening frequently used folders like Downloads and Screenshots, and even websites. A Bookmark can be triggered by searching for a keyword, or through its own dedicated keyboard shortcut (I’ve set one up for my Downloads folder, which is really handy). For more, I’ve got a detailed guide on setting up Command Palette that you should check out.\n\nIt's mind-boggling that Windows 11 still does not have an automatic dark mode. Over the years, Windows 11's dark theme has slowly expanded to cover all the apps you care about. But there's no easy way to toggle it on, and there's no way to automatically turn it on in evening, or on a schedule.\n\nSo, of course, there's a PowerToys utility for that. The recently added Light Switch utility lets you create a global custom keyboard shortcut for turning on the dark theme. For the Schedule section in the Light Switch utility, you can set up an automated schedule based on fixed hours, or using the local sunset time, which is how I use it.\n\nI shuffle between macOS and Windows 11 all the time, and there are some creature comforts in macOS that I now have a hard time living without. One of them is the ability to quickly preview any file in Finder by pressing the Space button. There is no such option in Windows, and until now, you needed a third-party app to enable it, which wasn't always reliable. Now, Microsoft has included a similar feature in PowerToys' Peek utility. Once enabled, you can press the Space bar after selecting any file to preview it. You can then use the arrow keys to navigate to other files in the folder as well. Press Enter to open the file in the default app.\n\nWindows has a built-in OCR (or text extractor) feature for images that can be accessed via the Snipping Tool. But it's really slow. When I'm in a pinch and I need to copy text from an image, I prefer to use the Text Extractor utility in PowerToys instead. It's much faster. Use the dedicated shortcut Windows + Shift + T to see an overlay on the screen. Use the mouse to highlight the area that you want to transcribe. Once you let go of the cursor, the text will be saved to your clipboard automatically.\n\nThis is one of those PowerToys utilities that really should be a default Windows 11 feature by now. Resizing an image, or a batch of them, is something that I need to do often, as someone who writes online for a living. But you might need it too, from time to time, to compress or resize images for an online upload, or a presentation. Instead of opening a heavy image editing program and manually resizing images one by one, use this plugin instead.\n\nOnce enabled, it will show up in the right-click menu in File Explorer. Select one or multiple images, click Resize with Image Resizer, choose one of the size presets (you can add more presets from the PowerToys app) or create a custom resolution, click the Resize button, and that's it.\n\nI can't imagine using Windows without PowerToys' Awake utility. It adds a handy little tray icon that I can click to keep my PC awake longer than the default sleep settings would allow for. I have a custom-built PC with a big honking power supply, so I take my auto-sleep settings quite seriously. But there are times when I'm downloading a large file in the background, or I have a long AI task running, when I want the PC to stay on. That's where the Awake utility really helps. You can choose to keep your PC awake indefinitely, or for 30 minutes, 1 hour, or any custom duration.\n\nThe built-in window management in Windows is quite impressive in its own right, but it falls short for my workflow. I usually like working with my text editor, a browser, and Slack open at all times. Because I have a large monitor, I have my writing app and Slack on one side and a browser on another. But it can take me a while to get everything set up. This is where FancyZones really helps. I can create custom zones for each app I use that helps me puts them where I want them, and resizes them, too.\n\nTo set this up for yourself, first go to the FancyZones section in PowerToys utilities. Here, open the Zones Editor and create a new custom layout. You can now use the mouse to move the zones around and to add a new zone. Once a layout is enabled, all you have to do is move a window around and hold down the Shift key. Dropping the window in any designated zone to instantly resize it.",

    "description": "Tired of all the Microsoft AI slop? You can remove it entirely.",
    "fullText": "Some people love AI. If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.\n\nIf you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out \nRemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).\n\nTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\n\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n\nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.",
