    "description": "StarCraft may be set for a comeback, with a new report indicating a third-person shooter set in Blizzard's sci-fi franchise will be revealed at this year's BlizzCon.\nAccording to a report from Windows Central's Jez Corden on what to expect from Xbox this year, a StarCraft shooter could headline Blizzard's fan convention in September.\nDetails about the game, including whether or not it will be a multiplayer title, are light, but it was first reported to exist in 2024 by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schrierer in his book Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. Former Far Cry lead Dan Hay is said to be leading the project. Corden said he's confirmed the game's existence with his own sources, but did not share any additional information on what the game will look like.",
