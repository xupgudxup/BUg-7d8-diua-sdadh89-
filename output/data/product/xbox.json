    "fullText": "PC, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox; Bitmap Bureau/Reef Entertainment\nArcade specialists Bitmap Bureau ply their craft in this retro remake of James Cameron’s action film. But Terminator 2D is at its strongest when colouring outside the director’s lines\n\nLike Arnie’s pulverised cyborg at the end of T2, the Terminator franchise has lumbered on long past the point of being properly functional. Every film since Judgment Day has been a disappointment or an outright disaster, and its video game spinoffs haven’t fared much better. While some half-decent ones have emerged, such as 2019’s Terminator: Resistance, there hasn’t been a great Terminator game in about 30 years.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense for Terminator 2D: No Fate to attempt to fix our broken future by travelling back to the past. Developer Bitmap Bureau appeals to the series’ heyday by retelling the story of Judgment Day through a medley of retro 80s and 90s playstyles. The result is a charming and frequently thrilling action throwback, though ironically it is at its strongest when it strays furthest from James Cameron’s film.\n\nTerminator 2D begins several years before the events of the film, charting Sarah Connor’s doomed attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne systems before her incarceration at Pescadero Hospital. These early levels, which see Sarah running and gunning her way through a gang of outlaws, police, and hazmat-wearing researchers, are among the game’s best. Bitmap Bureau does a remarkable job capturing Linda Hamilton’s gritty performance in a handful of pixels, while the scenarios eke impressive variety from simple arcade fundamentals.\n\nThe momentum carries on into the future, where you spend a couple of levels fighting the armies of Skynet as adult John Connor in nuclear-blasted LA. Terminator 2D ramps up the spectacle here, with laser weapons and incendiary grenades deployed against Chrome-plated T-800s and several enormous mini-bosses. The section culminates in a thrilling boss fight against a flying Hunter-Killer drone, at which Bitmap Bureau throws all the fireworks its 16-bit aesthetic allows.\n\nNo Fate loses some of its thrust once it catches up with Judgment Day. The midsection replicates key scenes from the film in playable form, such as the chase sequences that bookend the story. But these feel overly constrained by the game’s self-imposed limitations and aren’t very exciting to play. Better served are Arnie’s bar-fight scene and Sarah Connor’s escape from Pescadero, which employ beat ’em up principles and stealth respectively. While stylish and capably designed, these ideas deserve more room to breathe.\n\nT2D regains its earlier verve in its concluding levels, though the story reaches its denouement quicker than the actual film. Fortunately, as is always the case in Terminator, the end is not really the end. Like its arcade forebears, No Fate places heavy emphasis on replay value. Not only do its harder modes challenge you with adjusted enemy placements, completing the story mode unlocks new pathways that explore alternate futures hinging on Sarah’s choices.\n\nWhile No Fate doesn’t move the needle for Terminator games as much as I’d like, it succeeds in resetting the clock for the series’ interactive arm. It’s a pointed reminder that Terminator has gaming greatness within it.\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate is out now; £24.99",

    "description": "While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had a very strong showing in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii \"problem.\"\nNearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.",

    "description": "It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the PlayStation Wrap-Up, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?\nWhile it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to Windows Central, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.\nThe Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40.",

    "description": "Arkansas State completes mission of winning season and unlocks a new achievement in Frisco, TX.",
    "fullText": "Arkansas State unlocked a significant achievement Thursday night in Frisco, TX.\n\nThe Red Wolves emerged victorious in the inaugural Xbox Bowl, taking down first-year FBS program Missouri State 34-28 in the first college football game played at the Ford Center inside The Star — the practice facility of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nImmediately after Master Chief from Halo handled the coin toss, Arkansas State wasted no time in completing a successful mission, pouncing on its competition to manufacture a lead as great as 31-7. Missouri State stared down the red ring of death but didn’t disconnect its controller. The Bears’ instead fought to the finish but failed to recover a late onside kick, watching a successful inaugural season conclude in heartbreaking fashion.\n\nArkansas State relied on the arm of veteran quarterback Jaylen Raynor, whose passing attributes looked maxed out at 99 overall for much of Thursday night. The junior finished 17-of-31 with 288 yards, delivering three touchdowns to three different targets. On the Red Wolves’ opening series, he delivered a strike to a 7-yard touchdown Jaylen Bonelli. He continued his rampage with a 71-yard sideline deep shot to sixth-year senior receiver Corey Rucker — a longtime Arkansas State standout playing his final collegiate game. Then to manufacture a 24-7 halftime lead, the quarterback played pitch and catch with Chauncy Cobb, who caught a 4-yard touchdown set up by one of Raynor’s several successful deep balls.\n\nRucker, who exceeded 100 yards in Arkansas State’s 2024 bowl victory, concluded his college career on a spectacular note. He posted 166 yards and a touchdown on six catches, exceeding 160 for the fifth time in Red Wolves colors. Rucker already held designation as the program’s career leader in receiving yards, but on his lone touchdown, he moved into sole possession of first place on Arkansas State’s all-time receiving touchdowns list, breaking a tie with Omar Bayless.\n\nMissouri State’s seventh-year quarterback Jacob Clark also saw a noble sendoff despite a losing effort, firing for 349 yards and four touchdowns against the Sun Belt opponent. However, the quarterback — who had been sacked more than any other QB in the FBS this year — was upended in the backfield all game long by an Arkansas State defense which generated nine sacks. Missouri State’s offensive line looked like it accidentally set the difficulty to Heisman mode, as Arkansas State defensive linemen Ethan Hassler, Demarcus Hendricks, and Cody Silger all frequented the hit stick to register multiple sacks in a pure domination.\n\nWith that immense pressure, Missouri State’s offense severely lagged, punting on seven of its first eight possessions. Because its lone touchdown over that 8-drive span was a 39-yard completion to Dash Luke, the Bears never snapped the ball inside the Arkansas State 35-yard line until roughly one minute remained in the third quarter. With Luke thriving in the second half behind a 7-reception, 169-yard, 2-touchdown performance, Missouri State’s offense surged late, but the Bears were in too deep of a hole with too time to fully climb out.\n\nMissouri State (7-6, 5-3 CUSA) still finished its first FBS season above .500 — a remarkable accomplishment for the program. Now that the Bears checked off their first box of playing in a bowl game, in 2026 they’ll look to move one step further by managing a bowl victory. Leading the charge will be SMU offensive coordinator Casey Woods, who is slated to accept the Missouri State head coaching position later in the week, as the team transitions to year two.\n\nArkansas State (7-6, 5-3 Sun Belt) wins its second-straight bowl game under head coach Butch Jones. The Red Wolves never won a single bowl until 2012, but now six bowl trophies will reside in their facilities when they return to Jonesboro. With the win, Arkansas State clinched back-to-back winning campaigns for the first time since its fruitful 2011-19 stretch, concluding the 2025 season with a new achievement in the inaugural Xbox Bowl.",

From this simple premise comes a joyful game of mindfulness and social interaction, as Alta learns how to serve up witty conversation and decent hot drinks. Colourful and highly stylised, it is a thoughtful study of burnout and recovery.\n\nInkle/Nintendo Switch, iPhone/iPad, Mac, PC\nAn attempted-murder mystery set in an a 1920s all-girls private school reveals itself to also be an eviscerating takedown of British class politics. Witty and beautifully drawn, it is full of amusing boarding-school stereotypes, from self-interested prefects to a terrifying matron, whose motivations and personal grievances must be slowly unpicked. It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.\n\nSupergiant Games, PC, Switch\n\n A stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.\n\nSokpop Collectiv, PC\n\n A gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.\n\nMegagon Industries, PC, Xbox\n\n All is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.\n\nCapcom, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n Capcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.\n\nHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Two aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.\n\n11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n After crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.\n\nPanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Set at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.\n\nTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n The Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.\n\nSucker Punch/Sony, PS5\n\n A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing the shamisen or wielding a sumi-e ink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.\n\nKojima Productions/Sony, PS5\n\n Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.\n\nSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n An extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.\n\nHexecutable, PC \n\n A satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funny and has a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.\n\nSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PC\n\n It’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.\n\nNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n In 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.\n\nTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n Even the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.\n\nDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n A young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.",

Two of the older titles featured are Ark: Survival Ascended and The Forgotten City, the latter of which is available on both console and PC.\n\nTo get access to these titles, you will need to visit the Microsoft Store while signed into your account. If you already have a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, or Essential membership, then all you need to do is click on the Subscriptions tab in the Xbox Store. All of the games will be listed under the Free Play Days collection for both Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S.\n\nIf you decide you want to keep the games and any Achievements you've earned while playing them, these titles will be getting a limited-time discount.\n\nAll of this year's Xbox Free Play Days games are listed below, and the event will run until Sunday, December 21.\n\nYou won't need to be a Game Pass subscriber to check out Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This is one of the two titles that fall under the Free Play Days For All banner.\n\nFrom December 16-22, players can check out a limited selection of Black Ops 7's Multiplayer and Zombies content, as well as the remastered Nuketown 2025 map.\n\nIn a nod to the holiday season, Black Ops 7 is celebrating CODMAS with the Sleighjacked MP Map that has festive-themed decorations.\n\nFallout 76 is the second and final game under the Free Play Days For All classification. From now until December 23, players can explore the game for free.\n\nThe latest expansion, Burning Springs, is included as well, and it features Walton Goggins reprising his role as the Ghoul from the Prime Video Fallout TV series.\n\nA Game Pass membership is required to play NBA 2K26 during the Free Play Days, as well as all of the other games below it on this list.\n\nThis game includes a new MyCareer storyline on current-gen consoles and online play to challenge other players.\n\nWWE 2K25 is only available though the weekend for Free Play Days. However, 2K Games is offering fans some incentive to stick around for Xbox players in the US and Canada.\n\nAnyone who purchases WWE 2K25 between now and January 7 will get a $5 Xbox gift card as well as 15,000 VC Pack.\n\nIf you're looking for a little less action, PGA Tour 2K25 lets players work on their swing while rising through the MyCareer and MyPlayer mode. Multiplayer modes are also available.\n\nBeyond Free Play Days, PGA Tour 2K25 is offering fans 12 days of daily free rewards.\n\nArk: Survival Ascended is one of two Xbox Play Anywhere games that are part of this year's Free Play Days.\n\nThis game drops players into an enigmatic island where futuristic technology exists side-by-side with dinosaurs. If you want to live in this world, you'll have to master both.\n\nThe Forgotten City also supports Xbox Play Anywhere. This title is an adventure that sends players to an underground city that lies in ruins in the present. But after discovering a portal to the past, players can see what the city was like when the people there were still alive.\n\nWhether they stay that way will depend on the choices made by the player.",

    "fullText": "on December 18, 2025 at 3:29AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThe best co-op Xbox games should get you yelling, cheering, and strategizing your way to a shared victory. Whether you’re sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with a friend or coordinating online across continents, there’s something uniquely enjoyable about overcoming challenges together.\n\nXbox’s ecosystem, bolstered by Game Pass and cross-platform support, has become a standout destination for cooperative play of all kinds. From story-driven adventures built entirely around teamwork to sprawling survival sandboxes that let players create their own world, the platform offers one of the richest selections of co-op experiences anywhere--often without the need to break the bank.\n\nThis list isn’t about the biggest names; it’s about games that foster connection. Some push innovation in engaging cooperative gameplay, others are great drop-in titles for visiting friends, and a few provide you with enough ridiculous moments to break ice of any thickness. Whatever your preferred genre or style of co-op play, you'll find something on this list that'll have you coordinating, competing, and celebrating with your pals.\n\nFew games embody the spirit of cooperation as fully as It Takes Two. Designed from the ground up to require two players, this award-winning adventure blends platforming, puzzle-solving, and genre-hopping creativity into one of the most joyful (but also emotionally-devastating) couch co-op experiences available.\n\nEvery chapter introduces new mechanics, from magnet-powered abilities to time-manipulation sequences. These developments often echo the emotional journey of the two emotionally fraught characters, and progress demands communication, synchronization, and trust. It Takes Two's Friend’s Pass makes it even more accessible, allowing one purchase to cover both players, or to experience a demo if you've not yet taken the plunge. Whether you’re battling giant squirrels in the wild or navigating miniature worlds inside a child’s room, the adventure confronts you with themes of unity, loyalty, and the depths of familial love. It Takes Two remains one of the best co-op experiences not just on Xbox, but in gaming as a whole.\n\nHalo has long defined cooperative shooting on Xbox, with many entries in the series still regarded as the best shooters by many, and The Master Chief Collection stands as the definitive way to experience the franchise with friends. This massive compilation includes six full campaigns, all playable cooperatively (although cross-play only works for Halo 3-4 main campaign and ODST).\n\nEach entry offers a slightly different flavour of teamwork, from the tense corridors of the original to the squad-based vehicular chaos of later games, and offers more than 120 multiplayer maps as well as community-created co-op content.\n\nOnline co-op allows up to four players in many campaigns, while local play supports two, making it ideal for both couch and online sessions. While still a good nostalgic time, performance improvements and quality-of-life updates have polished the experience significantly since launch. Whether you’re revisiting the series or discovering it for the first time, The Master Chief Collection remains a benchmark for cooperative FPS gameplay and an essential piece of Xbox history. Why not play it on the console it was made for?\n\nPowerwash Simulator 2 builds on the surprisingly addictive formula of the original by expanding environments, tools, and multiplayer options into a full-fledged shared experience in online, shared, and split-screen co-op. The premise is simple (you just clean things) but the game's simplicity gives way to relaxing, collaborative gameplay that'll see hours pass by as if they were minutes. Working together to restore derelict vehicles, muddied murals, and crusty old houses, turns into a calming blend of methodical cleaning and quiet teamwork. You could even use it to catch up about the day's events.\n\nThe sequel features more intricate multi-stage jobs, improved water physics, and new powerwasher customization options. Co-op lets you divide and conquer or tackle hard-to-reach angles together, and communication naturally emerges as you and your partner strategize how to approach each mess. It’s the kind of game that encourages conversation, turning long sessions into both a chill hangout and a satisfying completionist exercise. If you’re looking for low-stress, feel-good co-op where you can yap over low-stakes gameplay, Powerwash Simulator 2 is an excellent choice. Keep an eye out for new DLC, updates, and free content coming in 2026.\n\nChaotic, unpredictable, and consistently hilarious, Totally Reliable Delivery Service is a physics-based sandbox where the goal of delivering packages is often less central than the floppy hijinks that happen along the way.\n\nUp to four players can join forces to race, tumble, awkwardly grapple, and ragdoll their way through a world packed with toys, vehicles, and interactive objects. The intentionally wobbly controls mean getting just about anything done is a bit of an adventure, whether you're desperately hanging onto a helicopter carrying a fragile box or launching your team into orbit with explosive machinery. Have you delivered anything in one piece? Probably not. Did you have fun doing it? Absolutely. Totally Reliable Delivery Service rarely punishes failure; in fact, failure is often the best part. It's a reliably funny pick for friend groups who are happiest when embracing the absurd.\n\nWhile Formula 1 might initially seem like a solitary sport, what with being alone in the cockpit of a car for most of it, F1 25 brings in an element of competitive and cooperative racing thanks to solid online functionality and couch co-op modes.\n\nWhether you want to compete on the same team or join a full multiplayer grid, the sense of shared progression makes the game a bit more immersive than just blasting through countless races on your own. Although we missed an F1 game in 2026, the game’s refined physics, snappy circuits, and broadcast-quality vibe make it feel every bit the modern game. It's not bad for first-time drivers, either, with accessible assists ensuring new players can keep up. F1 25 can also be played in VR, so if you're a fan of great VR games, you can literally put yourself in the driver's seat for this one.\n\nWe don't often give games 10/10 but in our Split Fiction review, we had to award this highest of accolades. This game truly is an unmissable co-op experience on Xbox. It has to be played to be believed.\n\nSplit Fiction is a two-player adventure from the creators of It Takes Two, another that made the list. Like the studio’s earlier title, every element--from puzzle design to narrative progression--requires genuine teamwork. It's not just a slapped on multiplayer mode, but a game built for two.\n\nProtagonists Mio and Zoe are full of character and charm, traversing beautifully realized realities that shift between sci-fi structures, fantastical landscapes, and surreal dream spaces, each introducing new mechanics that emphasize collaboration, and each written or imagined by the leads themselves. It's a literary tale of friendship and creative identity, bringing together two disparate characters and their inner worlds. Whether you're manipulating time, controlling gravity, or using asymmetric abilities to bridge gaps, both players remain equally essential throughout the experience. We can't sing its praises enough.\n\nThe Hazelight Friend Pass returns, allowing two people to play with only one copy of the game, and lowering the barrier to entry. You've really got no excuse not to play one of 2025's best games on Xbox.\n\nGrounded 2 is still in development so while you can play it on Xbox GamePass, and it's one of the best current Xbox GamePass games, it might have plenty of… bugs (sorry). It's a tried and tested formula, though, by shrinking players to insect size and dropping them into a backyard teeming with danger, Grounded 2 transforms everyday blades of grass into towering forests and ants into territorial predators, expanding on the groundwork established by the original game.\n\nCo-op is where the game's survival-crafting elements truly shine. Up to four players can work together to build bases, craft survival tools, and explore the expansive yard, discovering secrets and confronting increasingly hostile creatures. The dynamics of survival feel more approachable and enjoyable when shared, and it's a nice light-hearted alternative to usually gloomy survival games. With ongoing updates until the game leaves early access, Grounded 2 continues to expand its world, so now is the perfect time to jump in with both feet.\n\nVampire Survivors lets up to four players combine chaotic builds as they face endless waves of monsters in increasingly wild arenas. Cooperative play drastically alters the game’s single-stick shooter rhythm--abilities overlap, bullets multiply, and strategic synergy becomes more important as enemies flood the screen. It. Is. Chaos.\n\nLocal co-op for up to 4 players makes it easy to team up and introduce new friends to this bullet storm breakthrough. You can revive each other, share pickups, and lean into different upgrade paths to balance damage, defense, or support roles. The game’s quick sessions make it ideal for players looking to jump in for fast, intense runs without heavy time commitments. Despite its simple, retro aesthetic, Vampire Survivors delivers one of the most engaging co-op loops on Xbox thanks to its unpredictability, progression system, and endlessly satisfying power curve. Also: big walls of bullets are always fun.\n\nOvercooked! remains one of the definitive couch co-op series thanks to its frantic kitchen chaos, escalating absurdity, and teamwork that pushes friendships to their limits. Overcooked! All You Can Eat combines both games into one delicious dish, along with plenty of new content and a full remaster.\n\nUp to four players must coordinate to chop ingredients, cook dishes, wash plates, and serve recipes under increasingly ridiculous scenarios--just try not to lose your cool, it's surprisingly easy to do so. Communication becomes both your greatest weapon and source of silliness as plans fall apart and the group scrambles to salvage orders before the timer runs out. The addition of online multiplayer broadens accessibility, while new recipes, mechanics, and cooperative abilities enhance the game's replayability. Whether you’re cooperating to serve a dish you'd be proud of, or accidentally sabotaging each other in the heat of the moment, Overcooked! is one of the best value for money party games on Xbox where just about anyone can instantly enjoy.\n\nSet within a sprawling, disaster-stricken research facility, Abiotic Factor blends survival, crafting, base-building, and exploration. Up to six players can work together as brilliant scientists navigating dangerous anomalies, otherworldly creatures, and the remnants of failed experiments. The game encourages players to take on complementary roles, from security teams and engineers to phytogenic botanists, each contributing unique skills to group survival.\n\nCo-op builds naturally as you divide tasks like defending choke points, researching new tools, or expanding secure safe rooms--remember, you do have to live here too. Environmental puzzles and randomized threats keep sessions unpredictable, while its emphasis on exploration rewards groups who communicate and plan. Abiotic Factor is a co-op Xbox game that'll have you hooked right from the start with its ridiculous tongue-in-cheek humor and limitless possibilities.\n\nA timeless sandbox classic and all-round cozy game, Terraria transforms into an entirely different experience when played cooperatively. With friends, its vast 2D world becomes a shared playground where you can collaborate on ambitious structures, share resources, and tackle bosses that benefit from coordinated combat. The Paladin's Shield accessory, for example, functions best in multiplayer, bolstering the team's defences with a buff that pulls damage onto the wearer.\n\nThe game’s progression system encourages players to split up tasks--mining for ores, exploring biomes, gathering rare items, or defending home bases, for example--while coming together for major milestones like defeating the Wall of Flesh and advancing into Hardmode. Co-op amplifies the game’s sense of discovery as players uncover secrets and generate shared stories, structures, and in-game lives. Even more than a decade after release, Terraria remains endlessly replayable thanks to frequent updates, deep crafting systems, and open-ended creativity.",

The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season. Overall, video game hardware sales were pretty bleak, reaching a low not seen since November 1995.",

Xbox boss Matt Booty told Variety that \"a relationship came about\" between people at Paramount and senior executives working on Call of Duty. \"They felt like they found a partner who understands the game, people who play the game, and shared a vision of what it could be to bring that forward,\" Booty said.",

The only change to the release model is that the series will no longer release back-to-back installments of the same subseries, as Modern Warfare and Black Ops have both done.",
