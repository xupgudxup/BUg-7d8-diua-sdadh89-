    "fullText": "and \n Darryn Bonthuys\n on January 12, 2026 at 3:40AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, narrowing down the best Xbox Game Pass games currently available can be a challenge. The subscription service has grown in size, offering a massive library of big AAA games, new day-one releases, and even overlooked gems--like one of 2025's best games, Blue Prince. The library is so expansive that you're almost guaranteed to find at least a few games you'll love and classics from yesteryear, thanks to the recent addition of Retro Classics.\n\nTo help you navigate the ever-shifting landscape, we've rounded up the very best Game Pass games available now. There are plenty more excellent games on Xbox Game Pass than the ones we’ve listed below--the service is loaded with worthy games. These are just the games we think every Xbox owner should play, and we regularly review this list to make sure we stand by our choices and rotate in newer releases. We'll continue to update this list as the Game Pass library adds new selections. Every month brings new games as well, and in case you missed it, here's what you can download and play in December.\n\nKeep in mind that Xbox Game Pass comes in various tiers at different pricing levels, which were increased in November 2025: Essential, Premium, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass Essential offers a catalogue of 50+ games and online multiplayer, while Premium bumps the number of playable games to 200. Game Pass Ultimate is the top-tier service that provides access to all games on day one, cloud streaming, and several more perks.\n\nFor the purposes of this list, we looked at the whole Xbox Game Pass library available in the Ultimate tier, so if you're subscribed to one of the other tiers--especially Essential--not every recommendation may be available. And while this list is a good place to get started, the library of games is even more expansive, and more games will be added throughout the year. Be sure to check back for updated recommendations.\n\nSome of the best games on Game Pass are the ones that push the limits on what a genre is capable of, letting you sample ambitious ideas for the cost of your subscription. In the case of The Alters, you're getting a fascinating blend of survival, base-building, and resource management. The catch here are the human resources you have to work with, as protagonist Jan Dolski's mission to escape an inhospitable planet is aided by his alternate selves, reflections of who he could have been if he'd made a different choice in life. The end result is both mechanically and narratively fascinating in this ambitious fusion of ideas from the studio behind This War of Mine.\n\nWho knows when Fallout 5 will ever emerge from a vault to see the light of day, but until then, games like Atomfall are proudly carrying the survival-action torch in its place. Inspired by the classic Bethesda series and the real-life Windscale Power Plant fire, Atomfall wastes no time throwing you into a weird and mysterious world. Full of existential dread and British charm, you're free to chart your own path as you either journey deeper into the unknown or find yourself taking a detour from the golden path in this delightfully open-ended game.\n\nFollowing a dip into sci-fi with The Outer Worlds, Obsidian's return to an RPG fantasy setting is one of this year's biggest surprises. Set in the Pillars of Eternity universe, you play as a godlike--one who has been touched by a god leaving you marked in a way that's visually distinct to everyone around you. Your journey through the Living Lands makes a point to streamline some classic RPG systems, while giving you an incredible amount of flexibility in others. Combat is a particular standout, as you can mix and match just about any variety of weapons and abilities, and easily respec to experiment with new combinations.\n\nBalatro was a breakout release last year--in fact, it was one of our favorite games of 2024--and the one-more-round roguelike poker game has only gotten better with subsequent updates. It's now available on Xbox Game Pass, and came alongside a new Friends of Jimbo pack that lets you change the face cards to crossovers with games like Civilization VII, Assassin's Creed, Fallout, Bugsnax, and more. If you've never caught up with the incredibly compelling and clever game, now is the time.\n\nYou've never played a game quite like Blue Prince. The first-person puzzle game has you exploring an empty mansion, but this particular manor house has a special quality: It's never the same from day to day, as the rooms appear as you \"draft\" them from a selection whenever you come to a door. The ultimate goal is to explore the mansion and reach the hidden Room 46, but the game's many puzzles and mysteries unfold and interlock in ways that feel constantly enthralling. And since it's on Game Pass, it's easy to recommend with your existing subscription.\n\nThe Call of Duty series has been among the top sellers for years, but some CoD games are clearly better than others. This year's iteration, Black Ops 6, is the best the series has been in some time, and the first time that a new Call of Duty game has been available on Game Pass at launch. The campaign is a smart and varied action spectacle that keeps you on your toes as it explores paranoid thriller tropes set against global events in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the multiplayer's new omni-movement makes matches feel fast and fluid, especially with the addition of inventive new maps that let you explore the space in a variety of ways. A revision to the perks system helps you specialize in interesting ways. Call of Duty has earned its reputation for a reason, and this latest release shows why.\n\nRead our Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign review and multiplayer review.\n\nAn impeccably crafted indie platformer, Celeste is known for its tough-but-fair difficulty and surprisingly emotionally engaging story. As you climb the mountain you'll come face to face with devilish platforming challenges that will test your skill, all while discovering a subtle story of self-discovery and overcoming depression. It has a stellar 94 score on Metacritic, so don't sleep on this one. And don't worry if you aren't a platforming pro, as Celeste has a full suite of difficulty modifiers that let you experience the climb on your own terms.\n\nWhen Microsoft finalized its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it seemed like only a matter of time before the studio's massive library started to come to Game Pass. We're still waiting on a lot of the catalog, but it started with a big one. The latest in the beloved dungeon-crawling RPG series Diablo, Diablo IV, lets you delve into the deep and macabre world of Sanctuary to protect it from Lillith, the demon mother. With deep and immersive character building and a regular cadence of seasonal content to let you further expand your characters with new abilities, Diablo IV is not to be missed.\n\nBigger, bolder, and more brutal than ever, Id Software unleashed hell on Earth with Doom Eternal, much to the delight of everyone who played this sequel. Pure action from start to finish and unrelenting when the armies of the damned were thrown at you, Doom Eternal is a metal journey through the apocalypse that takes no prisoners.\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages feels like a return to form for id Software's iconic series. While Doom Eternal would regularly leave you breathless with its hyper-kinetic gameplay and resource-juggling, The Dark Ages keeps the action grounded by transforming the Doom Slayer into an overpowered engine of destruction. The stand-and-fight mantra guiding this prequel works wonders, while the bullet-hell challenge and shield-bashing gameplay makes ripping and tearing through demonic hordes feel more satisfying than ever.\n\nRead our Doom: The Dark Ages review.\n\nFBC: Firebreak takes a while to get going, but once all of its pieces fall into place, this co-op first-person-shooter is an exciting stab at the live-service genre. The Control spin-off also makes a statement to the current hamster wheel of FOMO that live-service games attempt to force players to run on, making it a breath of fresh air in an industry where your attention span has become a valuable commodity.\n\nRead our FBC: Firebreak review.\n\nBetween its amazing visuals, myriad gameplay options, and bevy of content, Forza Horizon 5 is a racing game that anyone can enjoy. From a technical standpoint, it’s remarkable what the team at Playground Games achieved--everything from the meticulously detailed vehicle models to the lush virtual recreations of Mexico’s landscapes are visually engrossing.. Better yet, the gameplay is some of the best in the racing genre. Unlike the simulation-heavy Forza Motorsport line, the Forza Horizon series lean towards arcade racing, emphasizing player freedom in vast open worlds. Forza Horizon 5 doubles down on the philosophy, letting players focus on the type of experience they want--be that tense races against other players, single-player challenges and story content, or just chilling out and cruising the open road.\n\nRead our Forza Horizon 5 review.\n\nForza Motorsport goes back to the series' roots as a simulation track racer, with stunning recreations of high performance vehicles. Car progression and upgrades are streamlined enough for fans to understand, but with the ability to get your hands dirty under the hood with precise fine-tuning. It's a graphical showpiece for the Xbox, making it a great game to try on Game Pass regardless of whether you're a gear-head.\n\nRead our Forza Motorsport review.\n\nThe original Gears of War landed on Xbox 360 almost 20 years ago, and in a testament to its enduring popularity, this updated version of the classic still feels as fun to play today as it was in 2006. The game is still a tightly constructed shooter with plenty of blockbuster moments and one of the best weapons in gaming history, the Lancer chainsaw-rifle. This version polishes it up for modern-day hardware, but the gameplay remains as polished as ever while you work your way through encounters with the Locust army. Or as protagonist Marcus Fenix would say, nice.\n\nGears Tactics cleverly applies the aesthetic and atmosphere of the franchise to a tactics game. Despite being a totally different genre, Gears Tactics still feels like a natural addition to the iconic franchise thanks to sound mechanics and great level design. Many of the notable Gears of War gameplay systems and quirks are adapted into the top-down tactical spin on the genre. With a meaningful progression system, deep but approachable tactical encounters, and a number of great boss battles, Gears Tactics is a can’t-miss experience for Gears aficionados and strategy game fans alike.\n\nObsidian's survival-crafting sequel builds on the strong foundation established by the first game to deliver a vibrant alternative to all of the gloomy survival games on the market today. It's still in an early access phase, but if history repeats itself, we're expecting Grounded 2 to be a bigger and better sequel that remains fun to play while Obsidian continues to fine-tune it.\n\nIf you’ve never played the Halo franchise before, Halo: The Master Chief Collection is the perfect place to start. The Master Chief Collection comes with six Halo games, including remastered versions of the first two original Xbox entries. Halo features some of the very best single-player campaigns in the genre as well as extremely solid online multiplayer, at least after years of fixes and improvements. Back when the collection was originally released, the online multiplayer was spotty to say the least, but it has come a long way. Halo: The Master Chief Collection offers the best way to play some of the most heralded first-person shooters ever created.\n\nRead our Halo: The Master Chief Collection review.\n\nHi-Fi Rush is a bright, popcorn animated adventure from the studio that brought you… The Evil Within? As surprising as that is, what may be even more impressive is that this is an absolute gem of a rhythm-action game. The original IP follows Chai, a good-hearted doofus who signs up for free cybernetic surgery and ends up with a Zune grafted into his chest. He comes out of the other side with the power to defeat corporate ne'er-do-wells to the gyrating beat of the world. It's like Elite Beat Agents mashed together with Devil May Cry.\n\nEnchanting and utterly engrossing, Hollow Knight is one of the best metroidvanias ever made. Team Cherry’s adventure stars a nameless knight armed with a nail who explores a labyrinthine world known as Hallownest. With a gorgeous art style and an incredible amount of variation in the environments, Hollow Knight’s expansive world is a constant joy to explore. Challenging combat rewards those with patience and perseverance. Hollow Knight truly stands out in a fairly crowded genre. If you haven’t waded through Hallownest yet, now’s a great time to slay some insect ahead of the sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong.\n\nAfter years of waiting--and several summoning circles--Hollow Knight: Silksong has finally arrived and it's turning out to be an overwhelming follow-up to its predecessor. Team Cherry's Hollow Knight follow-up builds on a successful formula, evolving it to a near-perfect state where you get to explore labyrinthine worlds, challenge powerful foes, and master a nuanced combat system as the protagonist, Hornet.\n\nOne of 2024'sbest shooters, I Am Your Beast is the kind of game you boot up when you're looking for quick but satisfying fun. Developed by Strange Scaffold, the studio behind another cult-classic,El Paso, Elsewhere, I Am Your Beast reinvents the movie trope of a retired special forces agent being called in for one last job and transforms it into a stylish gauntlet of danger as you sprint, slide, and shoot your way through entire armies of goons. The fast-paced nature of the game means that you have to think quickly if you want to avoid a bullet to the head, and each successful run is an exhilarating experience.\n\nMachineGames' take on Indiana Jones is a masterful take on the famous relic hunter. The action is a tightly designed clockwork of action, stealth, and immersive-sim elements that capture Indy's famous improvisational style. The story is rich and engaging and belongs right on the shelf next to some of Indy's other great adventures. And the character and worldbuilding are all top-notch, which helps to sell Troy Baker's take on the famous character popularized by actor Harrison Ford. It's the complete package, and a great reason to \n\nRead our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review.\n\nKeeper is exactly the kind of game that Game Pass needs. A weird and experimental title from Double Fine, Keeper is an artistic triumph with a heartfelt tale at its core. Constantly interesting on a visual level and frequently reinventing itself with new gameplay hooks, Keeper is a strong example of why video games can be considered art.\n\nLost in Random: The Eternal Die wears its Hades influence proudly on its sleeve, but this roguelike action game also has several novel ideas of its own. The roll of the dice plays a crucial part in determining just how well--or poorly-- your next run will go, and with a gripping story to boot, the game puts a fun spin on a familiar genre.\n\nThough it's still in early access, Manor Lords has quickly gained a following as a deep and engrossing strategy game that encompasses several different types of strategy at once. You'll build a city with complex social and economic systems at play, as well as take part in huge tactical battles against rival lords. Building your civilization from almost nothing and helping it manage trials like an unforgiving winter is so satisfying, and the depth of the game is made even more impressive by it being the work of just one developer.\n\nManagement sims are--by design--a stressful time. Sure, the sense of victory that comes from braving an administrative adventure is second to none, but Minami Lane puts a cozy spin on this genre so that your blood pressure doesn't spike. It's a digestible city-builder with a wholesome vibe that is worth checking out.\n\nSave the Spire saw a new wave of roguelike deckbuilders follow in its wake, and Monster Train was easily one of the best. The bar was set high for the sequel, but Monster Train 2 is a confident follow-up to the first game that builds on its solid foundation and adds a few new twists and a tremendous amount of replayability.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong is dominating the metroidvania charts right now, but don't sleep on Nine Sols. Beautifully crafted and featuring a rich hand-drawn art style, the game combines its metroidvania influences with Sekiro-inspired combat to create tense and exciting moments in every level you explore. The smooth animation combined with the responsive controls makes for a winning formula, while the \"Taopunk\" setting gives the game a unique look and feel.\n\nWhen all the pieces fall together, Ninja Gaiden 4 offers an intoxicating blend of action and challenge. The first mainline entry in many years, Ninja Gaiden 4 is focused purely on gameplay and over-the-top boss fights that'll push you to the very edge of your seat. It's the purest lean-forward game out there, a fast-paced meat-grinder that requires your utmost concentration, but being in the zone with this game is an absolute treat once you start dishing out gruesome combos. The story and its lead protagonist are instantly forgettable, but the experience of scraping through battles against ultra-aggressive enemies and tanky bosses will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nRead our Ninja Gaiden 4 review.\n\nBoth games in Moon Studios’ incredible Ori series are worth playing. Ori and the Blind Forest and its 2020 sequel Ori and the Will of the Wisps are two of the best platformers available on Xbox. Both have stunning visuals and tell emotionally gripping stories that feed off of the atmosphere and well-drawn characters. While they are similar in terms of aesthetic and feel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is more action-oriented, whereas the Blind Forest largely focuses on platforming and exploration. The Will of the Wisps gives Ori new abilities that help them square off against daunting bosses. Both games are brilliant in their own right, and are must-play platformers on Xbox. You should play them in order to get the full emotional weight of the story.\n\nRead our Ori and Will of the Wisps review.\n\nWho knows when Fallout will make its grand return, but until then, The Outer Worlds continues to be a fine substitute for Bethesda's series. To its credit, The Outer Worlds 2 makes great strides in cementing its own identity, as this tongue-in-cheek take on sci-fi adventures from a bygone era and late-stage capitalism run amok puts its own spin on a familiar formula. With combat options that feel more flexible, a quirky cast of characters to meet, and a distinct sense of satire that allows it to poke the corporate space-bear, Obsidian's sequel is a spacefaring delight.\n\nRead our The Outer Wilds 2 review.\n\nOne of the most unusual games on Game Pass, or anywhere, Pentiment is an adventure game set in 16th century Bavaria. As a manuscript illustrator sent to an Abbey, you're caught up in a series of murders. The decades-spanning story explores the idea of historical narrative and how truth is recorded and remembered across generations. It's really unlike anything else.\n\nThe first Pillars of Eternity was a thrilling study in old school RPG gameplay with a modern makeover, but its sequel outdoes the original in almost every way possible. A more confident follow-up that doubles down on its strengths while further refining its formula, Obsidian Entertainment's sophomore effort is an entertaining game filled with rich writing and easily-accessible gameplay for newcomers to the genre.\n\nRead our Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire review.\n\nIt's safe to say that there's no game like Psychonauts 2 on the market, as Double Fine's return to the cult-classic world of Razputin Aquato and the titular psychic peacekeeping agency is an absolute mind-blast of imaginative design. Fun to play and packing an emotional wallop with its exploration of several characters and a deep dive into their respective psyches, Psychonauts 2 is both a hilarious and heartfelt effort.\n\nThe first Plague Tale was an unexpected hit from a relatively small developer punching above its weight. The sequel could have expanded its scope, but instead, Asobo Studio kept its narrative tightly focused on telling a human story set in an alternative French history. Though the rat-controlling mechanics have been expanded, the story is still concerned primarily with the family dynamics between Hugo and his protective older sister, Amicia. It's also a downright beautiful game, with lush environments that rival those from the biggest AAA studios.\n\nRead our A Plague Tale: Requiem review.\n\nFootball fans don't have much to choose from in the genre, thanks to EA dominating the scene with its annual EA Sports FC series. But in 2025, Sifu developer Sloclap hit the field with a game that felt and played like the polar opposite of EA's franchise. A refreshing skill-based approach to football, Rematch keeps things simple, engaging, and exciting with every footie match. Fun to learn and satisfying to master, recent improvements have addressed the rougher parts of the game, transforming it into a thrilling spectacle of five-a-side football.\n\nUsing the momentum from Resident Evil 7 to push the franchise to gory new heights, 2021's Resident Evil Village continues the terrifying journey of protagonist Ethan Winters. Venturing into a mysterious European village teeming with all manner of new bioweapon horrors, Resident Evil Village plays like a highlight reel of the series with its grotesque monster designs, action-packed horror gameplay, and suspense-fueled design that keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times.\n\nRead our Resident Evil Village review.\n\nIt's a great time to be a Prince of Persia fan, as not only have we gotten the superb metroidvania The Lost Crown, but also Evil Empire's fun roguelike The Rogue Prince of Persia. After spending several months in Steam Early Access, the full game is a terrific love-letter to classic Prince of Persia action, mixing the influences of the older platforming games with plenty of Dead Cells DNA. Where The Rogue Prince of Persia sets itself apart is in its movement and storytelling, as the game is at its best when you're using parkour to smoothly dodge traps and acrobatic combat to weave between enemies as you build up strength for a glorious run.\n\nA live-service game that's not all about the shooting, Sea of Thieves is Rare's quirky take on a pirate simulator. It's gone through a lot of iterations since it was first released in 2018, so nowadays it's a full-fledged pirate simulator. You can crew your ship and sail the high seas, plunder other ships, find hidden treasure, and even deal with otherworldly pirate ghosts.\n\nRead our Sea of Thieves review.\n\nSlay the Spire marries deck-building with roguelike systems to create one of the best indies in recent years. Throughout your journey up the Spire, you square off against monsters, uncover treasures, and expand your deck of cards. Slay the Spire's card-based combat is easy to get the hang of but requires trial and error to find success. While you have to start back at the beginning each time you die, you gradually earn new cards, which help you advance further the next time. It’s an intoxicating loop that makes it easy to want to try “one more time” before putting down the controller. Each of Slay the Spire’s four playable characters have unique decks, adding a ton of incentive to brave the Spire for subsequent runs after the credits roll.\n\nRead our Slay the Spire review.\n\nCompulsion Games has repeatedly designed incredible worlds that are rich in atmosphere and intrigue, and South of Midnight is no exception. Set in the American Deep South and inspired by the myths told by the people who live there, South of Midnight encapsulates the sights, sounds, and culture of a place rarely explored in video games and doesn't shy away from delving into the community's hardships and traumas to weave together a fantastical and oftentimes chilling gothic horror tale. The whole experience is brought to life with superb voice acting and a poignant soundtrack, transforming otherwise ordinary moments of combat and platforming into a cinematic experience that's well-worth experiencing.\n\nRead our South of Midnight review.\n\nStar Wars Outlaws might be a one-and-done game, but Ubisoft's dive into the seedier underbelly of that famous sci-fi franchise is a thrill ride. Ditching lightsabers for blasters and a shoot-first attitude, Outlaws succeeds in making you feel like a scoundrel as you explore planets, double-cross crime cartels regularly, and do your best to stay off the radar of the Galactic Empire and its seemingly limitless supply of Stormtroopers. Come for the interstellar adventure and stay for the high-stakes Sabacc table in this open-world gem.\n\nRead our Star Wars Outlaws review.\n\nWhat's old is new again, as the best Tony Hawk games are kick-flipping their way back into relevance. While we're still not sold on the changes made to THPS4 in this two-for-one special, there's no denying that the subtle changes under the hood and the new coat have paint have helped to successfully bring the series into the modern age of gaming. There's also a healthy amount of new content here that doesn't detract from the nostalgic appeal of these games, making it a must-play for veterans and newcomers alike.\n\nRead our Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4 review.\n\nTunic, the long-awaited adventure starring a fox with a sword, is more than just a great Zelda-like. While it harks back to old-school Zelda games in terms of not guiding players toward the objectives, Tunic has its own approach to creating mystery and intrigue. All throughout the world you'll find pages of an instruction manual--really does look like one that would've been packaged with a game in the early '90s--that you have to piece together to learn about the world around you. It does a wonderful job replicating the thrill of discovery found in early Zelda games. Tunic is much harder than Zelda games from a combat perspective, but overcoming each challenge feels like a great triumph. Plus, any combat pains you may have are made worthwhile by gorgeous world that is a joy to explore.\n\nWhen it comes to gaming, there's nothing in the rulebook that says a cycling game can't cover topics like the apocalypse and ghosts. Wheel World is a prime example of this, as developer Messhof's delightful tour across a colorful world features multiple elements that mesh together well, like gears on an obscenely priced bicycle. Not only does the cycling feel great, but you're given a chance to pedal your way through gorgeous realms with it, ignite your competitive spirit, and trick it out before you save the world from total ruin.\n\nObsidian Entertainment's The Outer Worlds was introduced as a spiritual sci-fi successor to Fallout, but the studio has successfully crafted an identity for its spacefaring action-RPG. Combat has been polished up, and choices feel more meaningful than ever, but the real hook is in how you approach the game and build your own legend. Whether you're a bumbling adventurer who fails upwards or an operative who wields sharp blades and even sharper wit, it's all up to you to figure out who you want to be in a solar system ripped apart by factional wars and corporate takeovers.\n\nRead our The Outer Worlds 2 review.",

    "fullText": "PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, Xbox, PC; Square-Enix\nThis landmark role-playing game remains a revolutionary tour de force\n\nAt first glance, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, first released in 1997 and now available in newly remastered guise, does little to separate itself from other boilerplate fantasy fiction. There is a hero, Ramza – an idealistic nobleman with luscious blond hair who cavorts about the medieval-inspired realm of Ivalice in search of high adventure. But quickly, and with narrative elegance, the picture complicates: peasant revolutionaries duke it out with gilded monarchists; machiavellian plots plunge the kingdom into chaos. Ramza must navigate this knotty political matrix, all while experiencing his own ideological awakening.\n\nThere is a strong case to be made that Final Fantasy Tactics tells a better story than the landmark Final Fantasy VII (which saw Cloud Strife and a ragtag bunch of eco-terrorist pals taking on the shady megacorporation Shinra). And with our real-world political focus shifting from the looming threat of the climate crisis to the more pressing rise of fascism (though the two are inextricably linked), one can make the argument that Tactics is now also the more timely game.\n\nIn this remastered version, the plot still sparkles. Shakespearean dialogue is now fully voice-acted with delightfully hammy performances: you can practically feel the spittle on your face as one of the game’s royalist rotters delivers an incandescent tirade against the common folk.\n\nWithin this terrific political tapestry, you engage in the real meat of the game: turn-based combat of rare malleability. Each of your party – Ramza, lowborn Delita, and many more – has their own “job” (essentially, a character class), and these can be changed and subsequently remixed with few limitations (want to create a gun-toting mage? No problem!). This level of customisation, coupled with the exquisite diorama levels where the skirmishes take place, results in a symphonic take on chess.\n\nThese battles aren’t just riotous fun; they are also poetic. “I’ve been dealt a hand. I simply play it,” says one foe during a dramatic showdown at a cascading waterfall. The line speaks to the tragedy that gradually surfaces as you play through these square-gridded encounters – the sense that every character has been thrust into a maelstrom of events bigger than themselves. Heroes, villains, and everyone in between are but pawns on the battlefield, hurtling towards their own prefigured date with destiny.\n\nThe Ivalice Chronicles is not interested in narrative flexibility; its plot does not bend to the whims of the player like other RPGs. The story’s framing – recounted as a historical account in the distant future – makes this abundantly clear. As such, the game is less about fantasy and fairytales than history itself. Forget easy resolutions: here, events simply produce yet more events; trauma begets trauma. It is one battle after another for Ramza and his comrades.\n\nThis might sound doom-laden, and, in truth, it frequently is. Yet there is no mistaking the moral principles that suffuse writer Yasumi Matsuno’s stirring story of inequality, division, and pig-headed elites who seek to consolidate their already mighty power. Matsuno, who studied foreign policy before becoming an economic reporter, has described Final Fantasy Tactics as a work of “class struggle”. Now, in the time of No Kings protests in the US, the erosion of political rights in the UK, and the further enriching of the world’s hyperwealthy, the game feels even more resonant.\n\nRamza offers a model for resistance, and also a commentary on the struggle of opposition in such turbulent times. He is principled, uncompromising and always seeks to do right – and his reward is to be deemed a heretic by the most powerful institutions of his time.",

Starting the collection after receiving their Xbox 360 and Neversoft's Western shooter Gun on Christmas Day in 2005, uncleseeth then went on a mad hunt for every single game ever released on Microsoft's seventh-generation console. From standard editions to different variants, uncleseeth said their collection topped at 1,353 games--well over the 1,256 needed for a \"complete set,\" which doesn't include the variants of various games.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Hisense Just Announced the RGB MiniLED Evo",
    "description": "The company also revealed that Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to its TVs.",
    "fullText": "Hisense is all about TVs at this year's CES—specifically, how those TVs display color. If the company's keynote is any indication, Hisense is extremely invested in leading the charge in color reproduction. Though its tagline this year is \"Innovating a Brighter Life,\" the pitch is less on how bright their TVs are, and more on how true to life their colors are, especially when it comes to accurately displaying the filmmakers' original intent. Will consumers buy a TV because their favorite movie looks a bit more how the director intended it to be? I'm not sure. But that's largely the idea behind Hisense's new RGB MiniLED Evo.\n\nHisense's biggest announcement of the day is its RGB MiniLED Evo. This iteration of the company's RGB MiniLED technology comes with three key upgrades: First, there's the \"Chromagic\" precision backlight. The company says this technology helps avoid color bleeding and tint shifting when watching content. It also boosts the colors offered by existing RGB MiniLED technology: Hisense says this new standard can display 110% of the BT.2020 color gamut with four-primary colors (red, green, blue, and sky blue, or cyan), while RGB MiniLED can achieve 100% BT.2020 with the standard three primary colors. The company says Evo also comes with AI-powered RGB color dimming with \"134 bit precision.\"\n\nSecond, RGB MiniLED Evo has a \"Hi-View AI engine,\" to sync color across the TV's backlight. This engine comes with a three-core RISC CPU and a 2TOPS NPU for AI processing. Hisense claims the chip provides a 40% boost in computing performance, a 70% improvement in scenario recognition computing power, and 100% upgrade in scenario adaption computing capability. The company says the RGB MiniLED Evo can help display shows and movies as the original creators intended them to look. Hisense compared it to OLED, which it says displays content with too little brightness, and QD MiniLED, which it says compromises the color by being too bright.\n\nHisense's RGB MiniLED—not necessarily just Evo—also supposedly cuts down on blue light. Hisense says its new display tech emits 60% \"less harmful\" blue light than QD OLED, though the science doesn't necessarily support the claims that blue light is any worse for you than other light colors. The company also says RGB MiniLED is 30% more energy-efficient than QD OLED, though it didn't include any references to back up those claims in the keynote. Finally, Evo comes with an AI calibration feature, which Hisense touts as a way for users to turn their TVs into professional reference monitors.\n\nThe company says RGB MiniLED evo is coming to its product lineup, including the U8, UX, U9, and U7 series, this year.\n\nWhile the RGB MiniLED Evo was undoubtedly Hisense's biggest announcement this year, the company also ran through some other news at the keynote. First, there's the XR10, a new projector that can reach up to 300 inches. It comes with liquid cooling, lens shift supporting a 4K projection, and 6,000 lumens of brightness.\n\nThe company also announced the MXS MicroLED TV, which can scale up to 163 inches. Despite devoting only a moment to the TV, company says the MXS won an CES 2026 Innovation Award. Hisense also made some announcements about its TV OS, including features like weather, calendar, and integrations with other smart home devices. But perhaps most notably, Hisense announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring both Copilot and Xbox Cloud Gaming to its TVs. That's pretty big news.\n\nFinally, if you're both a Hisense and a FIFA fan, you can buy products from the \"Hisense Elite Collection,\" which are designed specifically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. I'm not sure how big that crossover is, nor do I think I'd buy a TV because it was made for one soccer event, but it was part of Hisense's announcement.",

    "fullText": "PC, Xbox, PlayStation 5; Embark Studios\nThe breakout hit, which has players coming together (or turning on each other) to battle intimidating robots in an apocalyptic future, is worth the hype\n\nArc Raiders is an extraction shooter from Embark Studios – so, a game where you deploy into a map full of other players and do as much shooting and looting as you can before making an escape. This is my first real go at the genre, and it’s excellent. It has smooth, only occasionally cumbersome combat, sound design that scratches the brain just right and robotic enemies that genuinely terrify. And it satisfies my constant need to sift through my inventory and rifle through every drawer.\n\nBut I have to keep my head on a swivel: Arc Raider’s player v player element means I can get jumped for my precious cargo by a malicious rival at any moment. And also, the knowledge that this game was made with the help of generative AI voice acting makes me slightly ashamed of how much I enjoy it. I play every game sheepishly looking over my shoulder (and my character’s) in case someone in-game takes my sought-after blueprint, or someone in real life kicks down my door to call me a hypocrite.\n\nIt’s ever more difficult to avoid AI in everyday life. Arc Raiders has become my guilty pleasure. In it, you play as a raider in post-apocalyptic Italy, living underground but regularly heading topside to scrounge for supplies, after a massive ecological event destroyed human civilisation and strange autonomous robots showed up shortly afterwards to scour the scarred landscape. These ARC can fly overhead, roll around on the ground, or leap extraordinary distances on four mechanical legs. Each is uniquely deadly.\n\nYou are woefully inadequate in a battle against most of Arc Raiders’ enemies, which means you’ll need to scurry around to avoid them, throw noisemakers to distract them, or attack as a team, with either the squad you deployed alongside or other players you convince to join you over chat. All of this is in service of the game’s one true god: loot, which you need in order to perform everything from repairing your weapons to crafting medical supplies to training your pet rooster so he can fetch items for you on the surface. And you can only keep what you successfully escape with, so if you die mid-match or fail to get to an elevator or metro car before the timer runs out, it’s all gone.\n\nThough my first few rounds of Arc Raiders were supremely difficult and punishing (in my third match, I found several pieces of rare loot and was then ruthlessly murdered by a squad all clad in red), Embark has ensured that you can make progress fast. You can upgrade your raider’s mobility, stamina and stealthiness every time you level up, and you can earn experience through playing rounds and successfully extracting. You can recycle things into crafting materials to upgrade your weapons and shield, or sell trinkets to merchants for extra cash that will help you buy better equipment. Even after a bad round, you still get somewhere.\n\nAfter every successful extraction, I want to jump right back in for more. I want more close calls, accidental explosions and terrifying sprints through ruined cities. I want to hurl more expletives over chat so that other squads know I’m in the thick of it, walk past another player blasting A Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carlton through their microphone, usher another half-dozen more people into an elevator hatch before I press the button to close the door at the last second.\n\nArc Raiders isn’t just fun to play. It’s a straight-up shot of serotonin.",

    "description": "A shakeup at an Xbox Game Studio suggests that AI will play a major role in Halo games like Campaign Evolved. The new Chief of Staff stresses enhancing workflows with machine learning on her resume. Other employees could use AI tools creatively rather than to improve efficiency.",
    "fullText": "Halo Studios has undergone dramatic changes in recent months, amid a turbulent 2025 for Xbox games. Rebs Gaming has been tracking new hires who all share experience with AI tools. With an AI consultant replacing Melissa Boone as Chief of Staff, the technology looks poised to infiltrate game development.\n\nScanning LinkedIn and job listings, the YouTuber noticed a familiar pattern. The most significant recent change was the arrival of Angela Hession at Halo Studios. The new Chief of Staff previously led the Gaming Safety and Trust team at Microsoft. However, she also founded a company specializing in AI-driven productivity enhancement.\n\nAnother new job ad at Xbox Game Studios seeks an Applied Scientist focused on machine learning. Not only would the employee work on Halo games, but also on other Microsoft franchises like Forza and Gears of War. Several current Halo developers in key roles have added qualifications related to generative AI.\n\nHow studios will employ artificial intelligence has become a point of controversy. Many companies argue that it’s a resource that boosts the output of developers. Yet, critics worry that human artists will lose creative control and, ultimately, their jobs.\n\nPerhaps the best indication of how Halo Studios will employ the tools came from a 2024 job posting. The studio was searching for a Senior AI Engineer to “leverage generative AI and ML to augment in-game experiences and to improve how we make games.” The description implied that the technology will aid more than rudimentary office tasks.\n\nRebs Gaming stresses the distinction between AI as a tool vs an author. Either way, it wouldn’t be surprising if Halo: Campaign Evolved or a follow-up title ushers in a new era of development. Microsoft has fully embraced artificial intelligence, building hundreds of data centers. Some analysts have attributed the closure of other Xbox Game Studios to that monumental investment.\n\nRebs Gaming YouTube, Microsoft Careers, Rebs Gaming X account",

Here are the best games you weren’t playing this year\n\n The 20 best video games of 2025\n\n More on the best culture of 2025\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nHave you ever wanted to romance your record player? Date Everything! offers players the chance to develop relationships with everyday objects around your house, in a fully voiced sandbox romp featuring over 100 anthropomorphised characters. Wonderfully meta; you can put the moves on the textbox, or even “Michael Transaction” (microtransaction – get it?) himself. Meghan Ellis\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nA raucous debut by indie studio à la mode games, Sorry We’re Closed is a survival horror where the monster is love and the dungeon is a dingy London neighbourhood. Fight demons, fend off unwanted admirers and survive work shifts in this queer, neon homage to 1990s PlayStation-era horror. ME\n\nWeb browser\nThe trick of this daily logic puzzle is that you can’t guess, or make wrong answers. Presented with a grid of characters, you must identify the “innocent” and the “criminal” based on clues revealed with each correct answer. But the game will only accept an answer if it’s sure you know it for a fact. An idealistic vision of a criminal justice system. Duncan Fyfe\n\nSwitch, Playdate, PC\nBlippo+ is a channel surfing simulator that rides the line between video game and absurd cable subscription service. Experienced entirely by trawling through the interface of a virtual TV guide, you can tune into intergalactic music videos, curious cooking shows, and psychic weather reports, learning an alien culture through charming live-action skits that evoke the sketch comedy of Tim and Eric. Sarah Thwaites\n\nSwitch, PC\nA sequel in all but name to Love-de-Lic’s 1997 role-playing game satire Moon, Stray Children is a monster-taming adventure where you whisper away the worries of troubled “Olders” that have come to dominate the inhabitants of an unfinished video game. Finessed by a crunchy pixel art style and a combat system inspired by Undertale, this nostalgic odyssey will pull on your heartstrings while testing your reflexes at the same time. ST\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nA fiendish, almost cruelly addictive mashup of Vampire Survivors-esque monster horde control and Breakout-style ball-bouncing. Descend into a pit full of demons and shoot a continuous stream of richocheting, burning, poisonous and otherwise deadly balls at them until the screen is just a brain-melting confusion of visual effects. Keza MacDonald\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nYou are a cheerful pubescent boy with a unique problem: your arms are stuck out in a T-pose. How do you navigate school, family, friendships and brushing your teeth when you can’t bend your arms? A sweet, family friendly slice-of-life physical comedy game with an unexpectedly affecting message, and excellent songs sung by a gourmand giraffe. KM\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nJust a chill bike-racing game where your ride is possessed by an ancient speed spirit. Wheel around a soothingly minimalist island of cycling obsessives, picking up new swappable bike parts and blasting past local gangs of racers on downhill courses. Uncomplicated, good looking and thoughtfully put together. KM\n\nPC\nPowerhoof’s excellent pixelated point-and-click game teases its dystopian plot throughout, mixing influences such as The Thing, Michael Crichton’s Coma and Total Recall. It’s an intriguing mix: combined with a heartfelt story full of painful human emotions and some fantastic audio, it’s a tense yet warming tale, guaranteed to coil its way around your heart. Graeme Mason\n\nXbox, PC\nWhile the combat mechanics are familiar, it’s South of Midnight’s evocative backdrop that marks it apart. Set in an overgrown and misty American deep south, it stars Hazel, a young woman thrust into the aftermath of a hurricane and forced to battle the evil manifestations of deep-rooted sorrows. Beautiful and engaging, its soundtrack is also wonderful, perfectly complementing the uncanny scenery. GM\n\nPC\nYour task is simple in the brilliantly silly Skin Deep: save a bunch of talking cats from marauding space pirates. The execution is anything but as you crouch in vents, pull glass from your feet, and deploy sneezing powder and slippery soap bars to incapacitate your foes. Like Metal Gear Solid meets a Looney Tunes cartoon, the pleasure here lies in pushing the game’s miniature sandboxes to their slapstick limit. Lewis Gordon\n\nPS5, PC\nCasting you as a knight with a hoverboard, Sword of the Sea is a mystical journey through a desert which roils like an ocean. You pull grab tricks and get big air on cresting dunes, but the greater enjoyment stems from simply soaking up the game’s breathtaking, nature-infused landscapes at high speed. A gorgeously dreamy, new age take on extreme sport. LG\n\nPC\nIf ancestry.com has yet to reveal your hidden royal lineage, try digging into the Roottree clan instead. Armed with a 1998 web browser, you have to deduce the loves, losses and lies of a sprawling candy dynasty (no relation to Rowntree). A compelling blend of Her Story and Who Do You Think You Are? Matthew Castle\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nShakespearean dialogue, bruising boss battles and a tale steeped in class struggle make this a refreshingly different Final Fantasy. As you command a troupe of society’s most downtrodden, excellent voice acting lends this once silent PlayStation 1 game new life. As rewarding to play as it is affecting, in 2025, Yasumi Matsuno’s tale of inequality and division has never felt more relevant. Tom Regan\n\nPS4/5, Switch, PC\nCombining the best parts of Hades with the immediacy of Streets of Rage, this colourful co-operative caper is an endless delight. As you roam Talamh’s lived-in fantasy world, this roguelike rewards you with satisfying new powers and beguiling side quests. With precise combat and varied movesets, Absolum adds some much-needed depth to the oft shallow beat ’em up genre. A co-op classic. TR\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nIf the prospect of a disgraced mobster tooling around small-town Japan accompanied by a giant depraved thumb doesn’t intrigue you, keep moving. But give Promise Mascot Agency some time and you’ll discover this compact open-world adventure is filled with chaotic charm. At its heart it’s a story of redemption, as you manage a gang of weirdo mascots and restore a dilapidated community, all while driving the best pickup truck in any video game. Christian Donlan\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nHere’s a fantasy role-playing game that’s happy to embrace elemental powers, even if it leads to pinwheeling chaos. In a world where fire attacks can spread uncontrollably and ice can lead to giant dragons dropping out of the sky as their wings freeze up, this colourful piece of whimsy offers fun that genuinely scales to your own imagination. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nMatt Newell’s hymn to photography is also a gorgeous investigation into the creative power of solitude and of paying attention to your surroundings. Learn your way around a beautifully simulated digital camera, but also explore the visual potential of a range of exquisitely crafted 3D landscapes. There are no puzzles and not much in the way of scoring, just you and your ever-developing eye. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nA football game that’s closer to the likes of Rocket League than it is Fifa, Rematch has you feeling as if you’re playing an actual match of five-a-side: developer Sloclap have utterly mastered the sensation and pace of charging up a field and passing between your mates before knocking the ball into the back of the net. Daniella Lucas\n\nPS5, PC\nProof that love and hate can be two sides of the same coin, this ridiculous adventure has you taking control of a grown man in a onesie trying to remember how to walk. You have to separately control each of your legs over a series of obstacles that lead to some absurdly funny moments, but equally has you kneeling in despair as you fall, yet again, off a wooden plank while trying to get a stupid hat. Worth it though. DL\n\nSwitch, PC\nA game all about slowing life down, While Waiting takes mundane situations – from breaking down in your car to waiting for a delayed train – and gives you multiple choices on how to handle them. Due to the way it rewards experimentation, and squeezing the fun out of everyday moments, While Waiting has taught me how to be more patient – and that wasting time by fiddling around with things is the key to a healthy life-balance. Thomas Hobbs\n\nSwitch, PC\nOne for the Halloween-loving girlies and ghoulies, this companion to Strange Horticulture has you dealing in occult objects rather than plants. Explore gothic Cumbrian locales to find artefacts, identify them via vague tomes, solve puzzles and occasionally divert the plot by giving a customer something other than what they wanted. Jordan Erica Webber\n\nSwitch, PC\nDeveloper Wadjet Eye keeps the point-and-click adventure genre alive in an apt tale of time-travelling tourism. As punters pay to revisit lost loves and settle scores, it’s your job to protect the timeline. From a timeloop farce to an urgent visit to pre-9/11 New York, Old Skies unfolds like a short story anthology. A surprise on every page. MC\n\nSwitch, PC, iOS, Android\nSudoku meets speed dating. This charming puzzle game sees you play matchmaker via seating plans, seating cute little characters together based on their hilarious pet peeves and preferences in a host of fun settings. Its puzzles are cosy, relaxing and never frustrating. Bex April May\n\nPC\nWhat if your friendly neighbourhood turned into a waking nightmare? That’s the premise of this RPG-style survival horror set in an apartment complex where unspeakable horrors are going on right outside your window – but whatever you do, you mustn’t look at them, or you risk mutating like your poor, revolting neighbours. Best enjoyed with the curtains drawn. BAM\n\nPS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nFrom its tongue-in-cheek writing to its ridiculous creatures, Toby Fox’s episodic role-playing game is charming and witty. Like Undertale before it, Deltarune flips the genre on its head with humour and heart, leaving you itching for more. (The game’s next chapter isn’t until the second half of 2026 at the earliest.) We dare you not to crack a smile at this one. Vic Hood\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nThis psychological horror immediately tells you what to expect: “This is a story about death.” As Sam, you attempt to escape your home, an increasingly twisted labyrinth of puzzles and memories. Channelling the unsettling atmosphere of Hideo Kojima’s PT, Luto delivers a powerful message about grief and life after loss. VH\n\nPS5, Switch, PC\nYou play as a fly in Time Flies, buzzing around different environments – a home or a museum, for instance – doing fly things, such as tickling people’s feet or avoiding lightbulbs. The time you have to complete the fly’s bucket list depends on your actual location, leaving just minutes or seconds to get everything done. Who knew speedrunning a fly’s life could be so delightful? Nicole Carpenter\n\nSwitch, PC\nAnd Roger is disorienting, devastating and one of the most emotional games to be released this year. From developer TearyHand Studio, And Roger’s evocative story and simple-yet-distinct art is reminiscent of Mountains’ 2018 release Florence. Within three chapters, a mystery unfolds: Who is this man in the house? Where’s my father? The answers reveal a tragic, beautiful story of love and family. NC\n\nXbox, PC\nSoft Not Weak’s Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To is a visual novel, dating simulator, and match-three game all in one. While it’s driven by its classic puzzle gameplay,this is a masterclass in characters and character design: Each individual you meetis just as interesting and well-developed as the last. It’s a must-play for both puzzle fanatics and visual novel lovers. NC",

    "fullText": "PC, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox; Bitmap Bureau/Reef Entertainment\nArcade specialists Bitmap Bureau ply their craft in this retro remake of James Cameron’s action film. But Terminator 2D is at its strongest when colouring outside the director’s lines\n\nLike Arnie’s pulverised cyborg at the end of T2, the Terminator franchise has lumbered on long past the point of being properly functional. Every film since Judgment Day has been a disappointment or an outright disaster, and its video game spinoffs haven’t fared much better. While some half-decent ones have emerged, such as 2019’s Terminator: Resistance, there hasn’t been a great Terminator game in about 30 years.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense for Terminator 2D: No Fate to attempt to fix our broken future by travelling back to the past. Developer Bitmap Bureau appeals to the series’ heyday by retelling the story of Judgment Day through a medley of retro 80s and 90s playstyles. The result is a charming and frequently thrilling action throwback, though ironically it is at its strongest when it strays furthest from James Cameron’s film.\n\nTerminator 2D begins several years before the events of the film, charting Sarah Connor’s doomed attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne systems before her incarceration at Pescadero Hospital. These early levels, which see Sarah running and gunning her way through a gang of outlaws, police, and hazmat-wearing researchers, are among the game’s best. Bitmap Bureau does a remarkable job capturing Linda Hamilton’s gritty performance in a handful of pixels, while the scenarios eke impressive variety from simple arcade fundamentals.\n\nThe momentum carries on into the future, where you spend a couple of levels fighting the armies of Skynet as adult John Connor in nuclear-blasted LA. Terminator 2D ramps up the spectacle here, with laser weapons and incendiary grenades deployed against Chrome-plated T-800s and several enormous mini-bosses. The section culminates in a thrilling boss fight against a flying Hunter-Killer drone, at which Bitmap Bureau throws all the fireworks its 16-bit aesthetic allows.\n\nNo Fate loses some of its thrust once it catches up with Judgment Day. The midsection replicates key scenes from the film in playable form, such as the chase sequences that bookend the story. But these feel overly constrained by the game’s self-imposed limitations and aren’t very exciting to play. Better served are Arnie’s bar-fight scene and Sarah Connor’s escape from Pescadero, which employ beat ’em up principles and stealth respectively. While stylish and capably designed, these ideas deserve more room to breathe.\n\nT2D regains its earlier verve in its concluding levels, though the story reaches its denouement quicker than the actual film. Fortunately, as is always the case in Terminator, the end is not really the end. Like its arcade forebears, No Fate places heavy emphasis on replay value. Not only do its harder modes challenge you with adjusted enemy placements, completing the story mode unlocks new pathways that explore alternate futures hinging on Sarah’s choices.\n\nWhile No Fate doesn’t move the needle for Terminator games as much as I’d like, it succeeds in resetting the clock for the series’ interactive arm. It’s a pointed reminder that Terminator has gaming greatness within it.\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate is out now; £24.99",

The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii \"problem.\"\nNearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.",

    "description": "It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the PlayStation Wrap-Up, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?\nWhile it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to Windows Central, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.\nThe Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40.",

    "description": "Arkansas State completes mission of winning season and unlocks a new achievement in Frisco, TX.",
    "fullText": "Arkansas State unlocked a significant achievement Thursday night in Frisco, TX.\n\nThe Red Wolves emerged victorious in the inaugural Xbox Bowl, taking down first-year FBS program Missouri State 34-28 in the first college football game played at the Ford Center inside The Star — the practice facility of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nImmediately after Master Chief from Halo handled the coin toss, Arkansas State wasted no time in completing a successful mission, pouncing on its competition to manufacture a lead as great as 31-7. Missouri State stared down the red ring of death but didn’t disconnect its controller. The Bears’ instead fought to the finish but failed to recover a late onside kick, watching a successful inaugural season conclude in heartbreaking fashion.\n\nArkansas State relied on the arm of veteran quarterback Jaylen Raynor, whose passing attributes looked maxed out at 99 overall for much of Thursday night. The junior finished 17-of-31 with 288 yards, delivering three touchdowns to three different targets. On the Red Wolves’ opening series, he delivered a strike to a 7-yard touchdown Jaylen Bonelli. He continued his rampage with a 71-yard sideline deep shot to sixth-year senior receiver Corey Rucker — a longtime Arkansas State standout playing his final collegiate game. Then to manufacture a 24-7 halftime lead, the quarterback played pitch and catch with Chauncy Cobb, who caught a 4-yard touchdown set up by one of Raynor’s several successful deep balls.\n\nRucker, who exceeded 100 yards in Arkansas State’s 2024 bowl victory, concluded his college career on a spectacular note. He posted 166 yards and a touchdown on six catches, exceeding 160 for the fifth time in Red Wolves colors. Rucker already held designation as the program’s career leader in receiving yards, but on his lone touchdown, he moved into sole possession of first place on Arkansas State’s all-time receiving touchdowns list, breaking a tie with Omar Bayless.\n\nMissouri State’s seventh-year quarterback Jacob Clark also saw a noble sendoff despite a losing effort, firing for 349 yards and four touchdowns against the Sun Belt opponent. However, the quarterback — who had been sacked more than any other QB in the FBS this year — was upended in the backfield all game long by an Arkansas State defense which generated nine sacks. Missouri State’s offensive line looked like it accidentally set the difficulty to Heisman mode, as Arkansas State defensive linemen Ethan Hassler, Demarcus Hendricks, and Cody Silger all frequented the hit stick to register multiple sacks in a pure domination.\n\nWith that immense pressure, Missouri State’s offense severely lagged, punting on seven of its first eight possessions. Because its lone touchdown over that 8-drive span was a 39-yard completion to Dash Luke, the Bears never snapped the ball inside the Arkansas State 35-yard line until roughly one minute remained in the third quarter. With Luke thriving in the second half behind a 7-reception, 169-yard, 2-touchdown performance, Missouri State’s offense surged late, but the Bears were in too deep of a hole with too time to fully climb out.\n\nMissouri State (7-6, 5-3 CUSA) still finished its first FBS season above .500 — a remarkable accomplishment for the program. Now that the Bears checked off their first box of playing in a bowl game, in 2026 they’ll look to move one step further by managing a bowl victory. Leading the charge will be SMU offensive coordinator Casey Woods, who is slated to accept the Missouri State head coaching position later in the week, as the team transitions to year two.\n\nArkansas State (7-6, 5-3 Sun Belt) wins its second-straight bowl game under head coach Butch Jones. The Red Wolves never won a single bowl until 2012, but now six bowl trophies will reside in their facilities when they return to Jonesboro. With the win, Arkansas State clinched back-to-back winning campaigns for the first time since its fruitful 2011-19 stretch, concluding the 2025 season with a new achievement in the inaugural Xbox Bowl.",

    "fullText": "A family classic reborn in a wide open world, a satirical adventure through teenage life and a mystery puzzler for the ages – our critics on the year’s best fun\n\n More on the best culture of 2025\n\nIvy Road/Annapurna Interactive; PC, PS5, Xbox\nAn arena warrior on a losing streak takes refuge in a vast forest where she discovers the joy of working in a cosy teashop. From this simple premise comes a joyful game of mindfulness and social interaction, as Alta learns how to serve up witty conversation and decent hot drinks. Colourful and highly stylised, it is a thoughtful study of burnout and recovery.\n\nInkle/Nintendo Switch, iPhone/iPad, Mac, PC\nAn attempted-murder mystery set in an a 1920s all-girls private school reveals itself to also be an eviscerating takedown of British class politics. Witty and beautifully drawn, it is full of amusing boarding-school stereotypes, from self-interested prefects to a terrifying matron, whose motivations and personal grievances must be slowly unpicked. It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.\n\nSupergiant Games, PC, Switch\n\n A stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.\n\nSokpop Collectiv, PC\n\n A gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.\n\nMegagon Industries, PC, Xbox\n\n All is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.\n\nCapcom, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n Capcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.\n\nHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Two aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.\n\n11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n After crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.\n\nPanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Set at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.\n\nTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n The Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.\n\nSucker Punch/Sony, PS5\n\n A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing the shamisen or wielding a sumi-e ink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.\n\nKojima Productions/Sony, PS5\n\n Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.\n\nSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n An extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.\n\nHexecutable, PC \n\n A satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funny and has a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.\n\nSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PC\n\n It’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.\n\nNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n In 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.\n\nTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n Even the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.\n\nDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n A young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.",

Whether you’re sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with a friend or coordinating online across continents, there’s something uniquely enjoyable about overcoming challenges together.\n\nXbox’s ecosystem, bolstered by Game Pass and cross-platform support, has become a standout destination for cooperative play of all kinds. From story-driven adventures built entirely around teamwork to sprawling survival sandboxes that let players create their own world, the platform offers one of the richest selections of co-op experiences anywhere--often without the need to break the bank.\n\nThis list isn’t about the biggest names; it’s about games that foster connection. Some push innovation in engaging cooperative gameplay, others are great drop-in titles for visiting friends, and a few provide you with enough ridiculous moments to break ice of any thickness. Whatever your preferred genre or style of co-op play, you'll find something on this list that'll have you coordinating, competing, and celebrating with your pals.\n\nFew games embody the spirit of cooperation as fully as It Takes Two. Designed from the ground up to require two players, this award-winning adventure blends platforming, puzzle-solving, and genre-hopping creativity into one of the most joyful (but also emotionally-devastating) couch co-op experiences available.\n\nEvery chapter introduces new mechanics, from magnet-powered abilities to time-manipulation sequences. These developments often echo the emotional journey of the two emotionally fraught characters, and progress demands communication, synchronization, and trust. It Takes Two's Friend’s Pass makes it even more accessible, allowing one purchase to cover both players, or to experience a demo if you've not yet taken the plunge. Whether you’re battling giant squirrels in the wild or navigating miniature worlds inside a child’s room, the adventure confronts you with themes of unity, loyalty, and the depths of familial love. It Takes Two remains one of the best co-op experiences not just on Xbox, but in gaming as a whole.\n\nHalo has long defined cooperative shooting on Xbox, with many entries in the series still regarded as the best shooters by many, and The Master Chief Collection stands as the definitive way to experience the franchise with friends. This massive compilation includes six full campaigns, all playable cooperatively (although cross-play only works for Halo 3-4 main campaign and ODST).\n\nEach entry offers a slightly different flavour of teamwork, from the tense corridors of the original to the squad-based vehicular chaos of later games, and offers more than 120 multiplayer maps as well as community-created co-op content.\n\nOnline co-op allows up to four players in many campaigns, while local play supports two, making it ideal for both couch and online sessions. While still a good nostalgic time, performance improvements and quality-of-life updates have polished the experience significantly since launch. Whether you’re revisiting the series or discovering it for the first time, The Master Chief Collection remains a benchmark for cooperative FPS gameplay and an essential piece of Xbox history. Why not play it on the console it was made for?\n\nPowerwash Simulator 2 builds on the surprisingly addictive formula of the original by expanding environments, tools, and multiplayer options into a full-fledged shared experience in online, shared, and split-screen co-op. The premise is simple (you just clean things) but the game's simplicity gives way to relaxing, collaborative gameplay that'll see hours pass by as if they were minutes. Working together to restore derelict vehicles, muddied murals, and crusty old houses, turns into a calming blend of methodical cleaning and quiet teamwork. You could even use it to catch up about the day's events.\n\nThe sequel features more intricate multi-stage jobs, improved water physics, and new powerwasher customization options. Co-op lets you divide and conquer or tackle hard-to-reach angles together, and communication naturally emerges as you and your partner strategize how to approach each mess. It’s the kind of game that encourages conversation, turning long sessions into both a chill hangout and a satisfying completionist exercise. If you’re looking for low-stress, feel-good co-op where you can yap over low-stakes gameplay, Powerwash Simulator 2 is an excellent choice. Keep an eye out for new DLC, updates, and free content coming in 2026.\n\nChaotic, unpredictable, and consistently hilarious, Totally Reliable Delivery Service is a physics-based sandbox where the goal of delivering packages is often less central than the floppy hijinks that happen along the way.\n\nUp to four players can join forces to race, tumble, awkwardly grapple, and ragdoll their way through a world packed with toys, vehicles, and interactive objects. The intentionally wobbly controls mean getting just about anything done is a bit of an adventure, whether you're desperately hanging onto a helicopter carrying a fragile box or launching your team into orbit with explosive machinery. Have you delivered anything in one piece? Probably not. Did you have fun doing it? Absolutely. Totally Reliable Delivery Service rarely punishes failure; in fact, failure is often the best part. It's a reliably funny pick for friend groups who are happiest when embracing the absurd.\n\nWhile Formula 1 might initially seem like a solitary sport, what with being alone in the cockpit of a car for most of it, F1 25 brings in an element of competitive and cooperative racing thanks to solid online functionality and couch co-op modes.\n\nWhether you want to compete on the same team or join a full multiplayer grid, the sense of shared progression makes the game a bit more immersive than just blasting through countless races on your own. Although we missed an F1 game in 2026, the game’s refined physics, snappy circuits, and broadcast-quality vibe make it feel every bit the modern game. It's not bad for first-time drivers, either, with accessible assists ensuring new players can keep up. F1 25 can also be played in VR, so if you're a fan of great VR games, you can literally put yourself in the driver's seat for this one.\n\nWe don't often give games 10/10 but in our Split Fiction review, we had to award this highest of accolades. This game truly is an unmissable co-op experience on Xbox. It has to be played to be believed.\n\nSplit Fiction is a two-player adventure from the creators of It Takes Two, another that made the list. Like the studio’s earlier title, every element--from puzzle design to narrative progression--requires genuine teamwork. It's not just a slapped on multiplayer mode, but a game built for two.\n\nProtagonists Mio and Zoe are full of character and charm, traversing beautifully realized realities that shift between sci-fi structures, fantastical landscapes, and surreal dream spaces, each introducing new mechanics that emphasize collaboration, and each written or imagined by the leads themselves. It's a literary tale of friendship and creative identity, bringing together two disparate characters and their inner worlds. Whether you're manipulating time, controlling gravity, or using asymmetric abilities to bridge gaps, both players remain equally essential throughout the experience. We can't sing its praises enough.\n\nThe Hazelight Friend Pass returns, allowing two people to play with only one copy of the game, and lowering the barrier to entry. You've really got no excuse not to play one of 2025's best games on Xbox.\n\nGrounded 2 is still in development so while you can play it on Xbox GamePass, and it's one of the best current Xbox GamePass games, it might have plenty of… bugs (sorry). It's a tried and tested formula, though, by shrinking players to insect size and dropping them into a backyard teeming with danger, Grounded 2 transforms everyday blades of grass into towering forests and ants into territorial predators, expanding on the groundwork established by the original game.\n\nCo-op is where the game's survival-crafting elements truly shine. Up to four players can work together to build bases, craft survival tools, and explore the expansive yard, discovering secrets and confronting increasingly hostile creatures. The dynamics of survival feel more approachable and enjoyable when shared, and it's a nice light-hearted alternative to usually gloomy survival games. With ongoing updates until the game leaves early access, Grounded 2 continues to expand its world, so now is the perfect time to jump in with both feet.\n\nVampire Survivors lets up to four players combine chaotic builds as they face endless waves of monsters in increasingly wild arenas. Cooperative play drastically alters the game’s single-stick shooter rhythm--abilities overlap, bullets multiply, and strategic synergy becomes more important as enemies flood the screen. It. Is. Chaos.\n\nLocal co-op for up to 4 players makes it easy to team up and introduce new friends to this bullet storm breakthrough. You can revive each other, share pickups, and lean into different upgrade paths to balance damage, defense, or support roles. The game’s quick sessions make it ideal for players looking to jump in for fast, intense runs without heavy time commitments. Despite its simple, retro aesthetic, Vampire Survivors delivers one of the most engaging co-op loops on Xbox thanks to its unpredictability, progression system, and endlessly satisfying power curve. Also: big walls of bullets are always fun.\n\nOvercooked! remains one of the definitive couch co-op series thanks to its frantic kitchen chaos, escalating absurdity, and teamwork that pushes friendships to their limits. Overcooked! All You Can Eat combines both games into one delicious dish, along with plenty of new content and a full remaster.\n\nUp to four players must coordinate to chop ingredients, cook dishes, wash plates, and serve recipes under increasingly ridiculous scenarios--just try not to lose your cool, it's surprisingly easy to do so. Communication becomes both your greatest weapon and source of silliness as plans fall apart and the group scrambles to salvage orders before the timer runs out. The addition of online multiplayer broadens accessibility, while new recipes, mechanics, and cooperative abilities enhance the game's replayability. Whether you’re cooperating to serve a dish you'd be proud of, or accidentally sabotaging each other in the heat of the moment, Overcooked! is one of the best value for money party games on Xbox where just about anyone can instantly enjoy.\n\nSet within a sprawling, disaster-stricken research facility, Abiotic Factor blends survival, crafting, base-building, and exploration. Up to six players can work together as brilliant scientists navigating dangerous anomalies, otherworldly creatures, and the remnants of failed experiments. The game encourages players to take on complementary roles, from security teams and engineers to phytogenic botanists, each contributing unique skills to group survival.\n\nCo-op builds naturally as you divide tasks like defending choke points, researching new tools, or expanding secure safe rooms--remember, you do have to live here too. Environmental puzzles and randomized threats keep sessions unpredictable, while its emphasis on exploration rewards groups who communicate and plan. Abiotic Factor is a co-op Xbox game that'll have you hooked right from the start with its ridiculous tongue-in-cheek humor and limitless possibilities.\n\nA timeless sandbox classic and all-round cozy game, Terraria transforms into an entirely different experience when played cooperatively. With friends, its vast 2D world becomes a shared playground where you can collaborate on ambitious structures, share resources, and tackle bosses that benefit from coordinated combat. The Paladin's Shield accessory, for example, functions best in multiplayer, bolstering the team's defences with a buff that pulls damage onto the wearer.\n\nThe game’s progression system encourages players to split up tasks--mining for ores, exploring biomes, gathering rare items, or defending home bases, for example--while coming together for major milestones like defeating the Wall of Flesh and advancing into Hardmode. Co-op amplifies the game’s sense of discovery as players uncover secrets and generate shared stories, structures, and in-game lives. Even more than a decade after release, Terraria remains endlessly replayable thanks to frequent updates, deep crafting systems, and open-ended creativity.",

The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season. Overall, video game hardware sales were pretty bleak, reaching a low not seen since November 1995.",
