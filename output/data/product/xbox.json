    "description": "A movie based on Activision's Call of Duty series is in the works now at Paramount, which is now led by billionaire and Call of Duty superfan David Ellison. Prolific writer and director Taylor Sheridan is writing the script for the film, with Lone Survivor director Peter Berg attached to direct.\nActivision had been trying to make Call of Duty movies for years, so why is it finally happening now? Xbox boss Matt Booty told Variety that \"a relationship came about\" between people at Paramount and senior executives working on Call of Duty. \"They felt like they found a partner who understands the game, people who play the game, and shared a vision of what it could be to bring that forward,\" Booty said.",

    "description": "This hasn't been the best year for Call of Duty, with sales for Black Ops 7 faltering compared to 2024's Black Ops 6. Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty touched on this year's installment of the military shooter series, and although he didn't address sales numbers directly, he did acknowledge the hardships of the franchise's annual model.\nSpeaking to Variety, Booty said that \"shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way.\"\nA new Call of Duty game has been released every year since the franchise's beginning in 2003, and it doesn't appear that Xbox-owned publisher Activision will stop this pattern any time soon. The only change to the release model is that the series will no longer release back-to-back installments of the same subseries, as Modern Warfare and Black Ops have both done.",

    "description": "One of the biggest surprises of 2025 was Microsoft's push to bring even more of its games to PlayStation, its longtime rival in the console gaming space. Not only have those ports been well received, but they've also been best-sellers, and next year will see the arrival of Halo and Forza Horizon on PlayStation. In a new interview, Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, spoke about the success of Xbox games on PS5 and the reaction to Halo's announcement for PS5.\n\"We had a bit of a moment earlier in the summer from end of April to end of June, where we had six of the top 10 games on PlayStation were our Xbox games,\" Booty said to Variety. \"I look at that as validation for the teams, but most importantly, it's an opportunity for more players to engage with our content, to come into our worlds.",
