    "description": "For reminders you really shouldn't forget.",
    "fullText": "Apple’s various apps and utilities are finally starting to talk to each other, and it’s great news for iPhone users. Last year, Apple added the ability to sync Reminders with Calendar, which added time-based reminders directly into your Calendar view—a feature I now regularly use. Now, with iOS 26.2, Apple is finally integrating Reminders with the Alarms app; you'll be able to set an accompanying alarm for any reminder.\n\nIf, like me, you tend to be forgetful—if you need a reminder for your reminder—this will be a handy feature. The alarm will sound, taking up your entire screen until you dismiss it. And yes, you can snooze it.\n\nTo get started, open the Reminder app, navigate to a task list, and either create a new reminder, or edit it. When you’re adding a date and time, you’ll see a new Urgent toggle. When you enable the Urgent mode, it will turn on an alarm that will go off when the reminder is due. The alarm will trigger even when your iPhone is in silent mode or in a Do Not Disturb Focus mode, so be careful when setting it up.\n\nWhen you enable this for the first time, you’ll get a connection request for integrating Reminders with Alarms. Here, tap Allow. If you don’t see this popup, or if you’ve dismissed it before, go to Settings > Apps > Reminders, and in the \"Allow Reminders to Access\" section, enable the Alarms toggle.\n\nWhen the reminder is due, you’ll see a full-screen reminder interface, with the reminder up top, and an option to slide to stop (using Apple’s new sliding interface for dismissing alarms, which you can disable if you want). You’ll also see a big blue Snooze button. This will snooze the reminder for nine minutes.\n\nWhether you hit the Snooze button or you use the slider to stop the alarm, Apple will add the Reminder to the top of the notifications list, as a Live Activity. You’ll see the reminder, with the snooze duration (if enabled), and the task. To actually complete the task, you’ll have to check it off from the Live Activity or the Reminders app.\n\nUnlike in the new alarm feature, there’s no way to edit the Snooze duration for reminders, or to disable the slider. If you don’t like the Snooze feature or the two-tap approach to completing reminders, you can switch it out for a Complete button instead. Go to Settings > Apps > Reminders and in the \"Urgent Reminders\" section, enable the Complete from Alarm feature. Now, when the alarm goes off, you’ll see two buttons instead: Slide to Stop and Complete. When you tap Complete, the alarm will disappear, and the task will be marked as Complete.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more\n\nThe iPhone 17 is loaded with new features, one of the best being improved scratch resistance. Regardless, we still recommend using a case to protect your device from major drops and dents. Not all are created equal; some boast military-grade cushioning while others offer a stylish flair. After years of testing and using various designs, we've developed some trusted favorite brands in the industry — keep reading to find our list of the best iPhone 17 cases you can trust for the job.\n\nWith years of tech and accessory testing under our belts, we've developed some favorites when it comes to case brands you can choose from. For especially clumsy owners with a need for extreme protection, Otterbox offers layers of shielding for the iPhone 17 with integrated buttons that make it easy to use. More style-forward owners might prefer the purse-like cases from Bandolier, which allow you to wear your device like a crossbody bag. Minimalists could opt for Apple or Zagg, which prioritize low-profile coverage with a splash of color.\n\nRead on to find our list of the best iPhone 17 cases available now. These fit the base iPhone 17, so if you're opting for a different model, be sure to read our guide to the best iPhone 17 Pro cases and the best iPhone Air cases.\n\nThe best case for your iPhone 17 ultimately depends on your needs. While one person may prefer a slim and affordable option like the Mkeke Clear Case, users who often misplace their device might like the convenience and style of a Bandolier Crossbody case. If you're looking for a solid all-rounder, I recommend the Zagg Crystal Palace Snap for its reliable protection, MagSafe compatibility, compact stand, and slim profile.\n\nDespite their similarities, the iPhone 17 is slightly larger than the iPhone 16, meaning that cases fitting the 16 will not fit the new device.\n\nLuckily, as soon as the iPhone 17 was announced, screen shields flooded online stores for the new device. If you're interested in protecting your phone's display, check out our guide to the best iPhone 17 screen protectors — even though the new device boasts better scratch resistance, it's better to be safe than sorry. I've personally loved the affordable protection of AmFilm's multipacks.",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",
