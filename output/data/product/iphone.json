    "fullText": "If appeal fails, every person in UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to compensation\n\nApple is seeking to overturn a landmark £1.5bn court ruling on behalf of millions of UK customers, which found the company overcharged them for years in its App Store.\n\nThe iPhone maker has applied to the court of appeal to challenge a verdict that campaigners heralded as the start of a “tidal shift against big tech”.\n\nIt is one of a cluster of cases heading towards trial in 2026 as consumers realise the mounting cost of paying up to 30% commission – what campaigners call the “Apple tax” – on apps and in-app purchases, which more people rely on for activities from fitness to dating.\n\nThe appeal, if allowed, involves one of several class action suits against Apple and Google in which consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs are demanding over £6bn in combined compensation. The class action cases use an opt-out system that means millions of people can be represented at once in claims of breaches of competition law.\n\n“It’s definitely a tipping point,” said Dr Rachael Kent, an academic at King’s College London who won the £1.5bn case against Apple on behalf of 36 million UK consumers. “People are pushing back against the harms from digital worlds, which they have to be living in and through every day and the financial implications of that,” she said.\n\nKent added that the win in October still felt “a bit pinch me”. If Apple’s appeal fails, every person in the UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a payout.\n\nIn the suite of class action cases, Apple and Google are accused of overcharging British consumers and developers in their app stores and, in the case of Apple, of “trapping” and overcharging customers with its iCloud data storage service.\n\nInstead of up to 30%, Apple should be charging commission of 17.5% when selling apps and 10% on in-app purchases, while app developers should pay 10%, the competition appeal tribunal found in Kent’s case.\n\nAnother of the cases is being brought by Barry Rodger, a law professor at the University of Strathclyde, on behalf of more than 2,000 app developers who he argues are collectively entitled to up to £1bn in compensation.\n\n“Small and medium-sized app developer businesses have suffered as the result of excessive profiteering by the App Store and Google Play,” he said. His case alleges Google Play has charged “excessive, arbitrary and discriminatory commissions” against developers, with the makers of dating and games apps particularly affected.\n\nHis suit is expected to reach trial at the competitions appeal tribunal in October 2026, and will be jointly managed with a claim for about £1bn on behalf of 19 million Google Play customers, who are alleged to have been overcharged. That case is being brought by the consumer activist Liz Coll and accuses Google of “excluding competition and/or charging an unlawfully high level of commission on digital purchases”, breaching competition law.\n\nColl said: “These types of large collective proceedings are new in the UK, but I’m really excited about the potential of the Kent decision to not only make people aware they were paying too much for apps through opaque commission but also that there is now a clear route to getting that put right. Where we need consumers to get really active now is in claiming back the money they’re owed.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “Android provides more choice than any other platform and our fees are the lowest of any major app platform. We’ll defend these cases vigorously.”\n\nGoogle argues that the class action cases seek to upend a system that has lowered prices and increased choice and that, if successful, would make downloading and using apps on Android phones more complicated and less safe.\n\nAnd in the largest of all the claims, November saw the consumer campaign group Which? announce a £3bn claim against Apple over its iCloud services, claiming it is “trapping” customers with Apple devices into using it.\n\nApple called the Which? claims unfounded and said no customers are required to use iCloud. The company said it strongly disagrees with the ruling in Kent’s case over the App Store, and the tribunal took a flawed view of the “thriving and competitive app economy”, with other platforms providing “vigorous competition”. It said most apps are subject to a 15% commission, and the App Store helps drive the UK’s digital economy, facilitating billings and sales of over $55bn (£41bn) in the UK in 2024.\n\nKent said that people are “waking up to the harms of digital life and how it can be detrimental mentally, physically and financially”.\n\n“There is a tidal shift that is happening against big tech,” she said. “Consumers are looking at all of the tools that they have to use every day. Covid really accelerated our reliance on technology and many of us went from using five apps in a week to perhaps 10 apps in a day to manage food shopping, food delivery, retail, fitness and diet tracking, keeping in close communication with friends and family, much more social media, increased screen time.\n\n“A big part of the last six years working the case has been about educating people that this is actually happening. That’s what tech giants and marketeers like Apple are so brilliant at. It’s creating an ecosystem where we are foreclosed into decision making and we don’t even realise that this is actually how it’s happening.”",

    "description": "Julia Angwin turns her iPhone screen to gray and learns a lot about her relationship with her phone.",
    "fullText": "I have long been skeptical of the current hysteria about how our phones are addictive machines destroying our previously pristine analog world. But a few months ago, even I began to be vaguely worried that I was devoting too many hours to an embarrassing medley of political commentary and makeup application TikTok videos. So when I spied an article about the benefits of switching one’s phone to a black-and-white color scheme, I figured I’d give it a whirl.\n\nThe result was shocking. The moment I switched, I no longer felt an urgent need to look at my iPhone — an urge that I hadn’t known was so strong until it was gone. I experienced a full- bodied sense of relief when the colors faded to gray.\n\nAn invisible cord had been severed. I would leave my phone in my room when I walked from my home office to the kitchen. I would forget to check it for hours instead of minutes. When I did check it, I put it down quickly as soon as the task was done. The number of hours I spent per day on the phone plummeted 40 percent, to an average of four hours and 40 minutes per day — still embarrassingly high, but not the vertiginous eight-plus hours I was averaging.\n\nI am still not a subscriber to the current moral panic about phone dependency, an over-the-top overreaction that has led to ill-conceived laws banning phones in school, banning kids from social media, requiring website visitors to prove their age before accessing certain sites and even requiring scanning of text messages for illegal content. I believe those laws are largely just dangerous restrictions on our freedom of speech and freedom of association clad in child-safety garb. But my adventures in greyscale have led me to the unfortunate conclusion that my own phone usage was a bit more compulsive than I had realized — and that we could all use a little help fighting our compulsions.\n\nScientists are increasingly embracing the concept called “problematic smartphone use,” which is defined as “the recurrent craving to use a smartphone in a way that is difficult to control and leads to impaired daily functioning,” in a 2020 analysis of hundreds of papers on the topic.\n\nAnd within this rubric, some describe problematic smartphone use as less an addiction and more like an obsessive compulsive behavior. Addicts are initially chasing pleasure; obsessive compulsives are chasing relief, researchers say.\n\nThat resonated. For me, checking my phone is often a way to relieve my anxiety that perhaps there was a crisis I needed to jump on.\n\nThere are some small downsides to my black-and-white online life. Because the answer and decline buttons on my phone are both gray, I’ll sometimes hang up on a call I want to answer. Fortunately, these days, nobody minds if you just call them back. Games weren’t as fun, so I started playing them on my iPad and discovered that I liked the separation between work and play that it enforced: iPhone for boring stuff; iPad for fun. TikTok is weird on the iPad, so I still try to watch it on my phone occasionally, but in black and white it’s just not as compelling.\n\nThe hardest adjustment was photos. My husband sent me gray pictures of a beautiful sunset. My daughter texted me a selfie in her Halloween outfit dressed as a ladybug. She just looked odd and slightly goth until I checked on my computer and saw her decked out in red. Eventually, I figured out a shortcut that allows me to briefly switch to color by clicking the side button three times.\n\nBut I’ve found that whenever I return to color, even briefly, I am desperate to turn it off again as quickly as possible. With my eyes no longer accustomed to the brightness, I now find the phone’s colors to be too vivid, too blinding — kind of like I’m staring into a Times Square LED billboard.\n\nTwo and half months into this journey, my phone usage remains about four hours per day. And I’m pretty sure I’ll never go back to color on my phone.\n\nIt may sound cheesy, but to be honest, I feel like turning off color on my phone made me more aware and more appreciative of the color and beauty in real life. Now that I am no longer turning to my phone for fun, I find myself seeking it out in other ways — reading more books, watching more movies, planning more gatherings with friends, hanging out with my kids. And that’s something I do want to be addicted to.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

    "description": "The YouTuber doesn't seem fazed by Apple's threats.",
    "fullText": "There are a few people that Apple would love to delete from the face of the planet.\n\nBloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who’s consistently divulging Apple’s plans, is one. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is always sharing information based on his supply chain checks, is high up on the list, too. But YouTuber Jon Prosser is public enemy number one that Apple is trying to truly silence. And for good reason: the man who Apple sued in July for leaking iOS 26 and Liquid Glass keeps spoiling Apple’s unreleased products with high-quality 3D renders in his videos—like the foldable iPhone that’s not expected to be announced until next year.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Prosser gave the world an early gift: a video revealing what he claims is Apple’s foldable iPhone in all of its book-style glory. Watch for yourself:\n\nIn his video, Prosser confidently states the foldable iPhone, which is rumored to launch next fall alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and 18 Pro Max, will have a 5.5-inch external display with a hole-punch camera. The inside foldable screen will measure 7.8 inches with a hole-punch camera in the upper left corner. His renders show dual cameras sitting on an oblong camera plateau much like the one on the iPhone Air; an LED flash sits on the opposite side.\n\nProsser says the foldable iPhone will be 9mm thick when closed, which means each half will likely be 4.5mm. That’d over a whole millimeter thinner than the 5.6mm iPhone Air, which is already barely thicker than a USB-C port and feels impossibly thin in the hand.\n\nThe dimensions do align with the rumored footprint from multiple previous reports. However, it conflicts with a recent leak that claimed the foldable iPhone would have an external screen that’s about 5.25 inches, which would be smaller than the 5.4-inch iPhone 13 mini.\n\nProsser’s 3D renders do appear to depict a foldable iPhone that’s wider than it is tall when folded and open. Side-by-side with a first-gen Pixel Fold, minus the thicker bezels on Google’s foldable, the foldable iPhone might look similar, down to the location of the hole-punch cameras. Other reports have suggested the foldable iPhone would have an “invisible” under-panel camera (UDC) in the folding display.\n\nThe big question will be whether or not Apple can make the crease less visible. Several previous reports said that Apple had figured it out, but the latest leak suggests that might not be the case after all.\n\nUltimately, a foldable iPhone will undoubtedly get lots of buzz if Apple does launch it next year. But the real indicator of its success will be whether consumers buy it. The iPhone Air is a state-of-the-art phone with impressive miniaturization that could be a glimpse of what’s to come in a future pair of Apple smart glasses, and yet it’s reportedly been a commercial failure. It’s been such a sales flop that there may not be an iPhone Air 2 next year. More consumers have purchased the iPhone 17 and 17 Pros than the super-skinny iPhone Air that has fewer cameras and less battery life.\n\nWill consumers see the value of a foldable iPhone, especially if it comes with an exorbitant price tag that could start at over $2,000? I’d say never bet against the iPhone, but then again, the iPhone mini, iPhone Plus, and now the iPhone Air reportedly didn’t sell enough.",

    "description": "Apple, Michigan taxpayers, and one of Detroit’s wealthiest families spent roughly $30 million training hundreds of people to build iPhone apps. Not everyone lands coding jobs right away.",
    "fullText": "Lizmary Fernandez took a detour from studying to be an immigration attorney to join a free Apple course for making iPhone apps. The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit launched as part of the company’s $200 million response to the Black Lives Matter protests and aims to expand opportunities for people of color in the country’s poorest big city.\n\nBut Fernandez found the program’s cost-of-living stipend lacking—“A lot of us got on food stamps,” she says—and the coursework insufficient for landing a coding job. “I didn’t have the experience or portfolio,” says the 25-year-old, who is now a flight attendant and preparing to apply to law school. “Coding is not something I got back to.”\n\nSince 2021, the academy has welcomed over 1,700 students, a racially diverse mix with varying levels of tech literacy and financial flexibility. About 600 students, including Fernandez, have completed its 10-month course of half-days at Michigan State University, which cosponsors the Apple-branded and Apple-focused program.\n\nWIRED reviewed contracts and budgets and spoke with officials and graduates for the first in-depth examination of the nearly $30 million invested in the academy over the past four years—almost 30 percent of which came from Michigan taxpayers and the university’s regular students. As tech giants begin pouring billions of dollars into AI-related job training courses across the country, the Apple academy offers lessons on the challenges of uplifting diverse communities.\n\nSeven graduates who spoke with WIRED said they had good experiences at the academy, citing benefits such as receiving mentorship from past students. Fernandez says she was impressed by a focus on developing inclusive apps and a series of speakers from Apple who were genuinely willing to help and share frank lessons. “Their heart was in the right place,” she says.\n\nThe program does expose people of color to new possibilities. “It changed my life,” says Min Thu Khine, who’s now mentoring coding students and working at an Apple Store Genius Bar. “My dream is to be a software engineer at Apple.”\n\nThe academy also draws positive grades from some researchers who study tech education, such as Quinn Burke. He says its fully subsidized in-person instruction surpasses the quality of many coding boot camps, which proliferated over the past decade and sometimes left students in debt and with narrow skills.\n\nBut the academy being open to all can complicate instruction and how to measure success. One entire family attended together, and at least two mothers have come with their daughters. Students on average are in their thirties, ranging from 18-year-olds to, for example, a grandfather in his seventies who wanted to develop a photo app for his grandchild, according to Sarah Gretter, the academy leader for Michigan State.",

    "description": "T-Mobile's holiday deal gets you four free iPhone 17s when you open four new lines on its Essentials plan. We're breaking down the details.",
    "fullText": "Getting a new phone is a great way to start the new year, especially if it's one of Apple's latest iPhone models. But why get an upgrade for just yourself when you can upgrade the entire family in one go? T-Mobile's current holiday deal makes it worthwhile by handing out four free iPhone 17s when you open four new lines on its Essentials 4 Line Plan.\n\nT-Mobile's Essentials Plan is already one of the best cell phone plans we've ever tested for those looking to open multiple lines on a budget, so we highly recommend it at any time. But with four free iPhones to sweeten the deal, it's a particularly good time to switch.\n\nNot only does T-Mobile's current deal get you a suite of the most sophisticated iPhones yet for free, but it also gets you an excellent service plan. Compared to other major carriers like Verizon and AT&T, T-Mobile's phone plans offer the best value for their quality, especially if you're opening multiple lines, like in this promotion.\n\nFor more on plan offerings, coverage, and speeds, check out our full T-Mobile review.\n\nIt's worth noting that you won't be getting the four phones for free up front. You'll earn back the cost of the devices via 24 monthly billing credits, which means you'll be locked into a two-year contract with T-Mobile before the phones are officially paid off. You'll also have to pay a $35 activation fee for each device. Still, this is less of a commitment compared to other carriers, which typically lock you into a 36-month contract for this type of deal. It's certainly a small price to pay for upgrades for the whole family.\n\nIf you don't need a new phone, you can still upgrade to T-Mobile's network. The carrier is also running a promotion that gets new customers up to $800 back when they keep their current phone and switch to T-Mobile from another carrier. Learn \n\nThe terms and conditions can be hard to follow for these phone carrier deals, so we're breaking down exactly how to get your free phones. Here are the steps to follow.\n\nT-Mobile's four free iPhone 17s promotion isn't the only one the carrier is running ahead of the holidays. If you're on the hunt for a Samsung or Google smartphone, a different iPhone model, a smartwatch, or even a tablet, there's a deal for you. Explore some of T-Mobile's current promotions below.",

    "title": "10 of the Best iPhone Privacy Hacks Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "Stop as much tracking as you can.",
    "fullText": "When you're using devices that are always connected to the internet, it's difficult to completely protect your privacy. Luckily, there are plenty of great privacy hacks for your iPhone, which you can use to make it hard for trackers and spies to collect your data and snoop on your business. From built-in solutions, like adjusting app permissions, to purchasing privacy screen protectors, here are 10 hacks every iPhone user should consider to protect their privacy.\n\nNo software privacy hack can protect you from people looking over your shoulder to memorize your password, or from peeking to see what you're up to. What can protect you, however, is a privacy screen protector. I saw this first-hand: One of my friends recently tried to show me something on her iPhone, and I realized that I couldn't see anything at all until her phone was directly in front of me.\n\nThese screen protectors can make it easier to use your phone in public spaces without worrying about who's looking at its screen. That said, there are a few potential dealbreakers. These screen protectors are rather plasticky, and don't feel as nice or smooth as your iPhone's touchscreen. These products also lower your screen's brightness. I don't mind, but it can be a problem if you're trying to use your phone in bright lighting. If you can live with these cons though, this is a cheap privacy hack that's definitely worth considering.\n\nApple is known for its privacy policies, but in recent years, its resolve seems to be weakening a bit. The company is pushing ads into its apps and your notifications, and it's aggressively encouraging iPhone users to There's not much you can do to block promotional materials coming from the company directly, but it's still worth changing a few settings to limit Apple's own ads. This includes reducing Apple's data collection, too. Many of these options are available under Settings > Privacy & Security on your iPhone. On that page, you can navigate to these pages to disable quite a bit of tracking:\n\nLocation Services > System Services\n\nCarefully reviewing all options on these pages and disabling unnecessary features goes a long way in limiting Apple's data collection.\n\nI used to allow all permissions an app requested when I first opened it. Over time, I realized that this led to a lot of notification spam, unnecessary data collection, and significant battery drain if the app was tracking my location. That's why I developed a new strategy: deny all permissions unless an app absolutely needs it. In general, I almost always deny permission to send notifications, access to contacts, location, camera, microphone, and photos.\n\nNewer versions of iOS allow you to share just a few contacts or photos, and even restrict GPS access to an approximate location instead of a precise marker. All of these are available under Settings > Privacy & Security in case you missed them while setting up an app.\n\nWhile the App Tracking Transparency option on your iPhone does reduce data collection from many apps, it's far from foolproof. In general, apps have access to far more data than their web versions, so if you can, you should try switching from apps to mobile websites wherever possible. If you delete apps such as Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok, and switch to logging in via Safari, you'll give away much less data, and some of the data you would otherwise give to the web apps will be blocked or spiked by Safari's privacy features, further protecting your data. As an added bonus, since web apps are generally a worse experience than dedicated apps, you're also far less likely to fall into a doomscrolling trap. I've used this fairly effectively with social media apps, but you can't always delete apps, like WhatsApp.\n\nInstalling an adblocker and a DNS app can do wonders for your iPhone privacy. Adblockers such as uBlock Origin are pretty good at blocking invasive tracking on your iPhone, but their effect is limited to Safari. To enhance the privacy of your internet traffic, you should consider installing an encrypted DNS app such as NextDNS, AdGuard DNS, or ControlD. All of these will block ads or trackers in most apps on your iPhone and safeguard you from some types of online security threats as well.\n\nEveryone should be using Safety Check on iPhone. This feature immediately lets you identify who you're sharing what with, including passwords, fitness activity, your current location, calendars, notes, and other data. To check on it, head to Settings > Privacy & Security > Safety Check > Manage Sharing & Access. You can go through the prompts to review app permissions, and set up an emergency contact, which ensures that your data (and you) are safe. While you can manually access all these options in the Settings app, the Safety Check prompt lets you find all features without combing through multiple pages, which will save you a lot of time.\n\nA good password manager is also a must. Free password managers, such as the built-in Passwords app or BitWarden allow you to create unique, strong passwords for each website, which makes it far less likely to compromise your accounts. You can also use these apps to store your two-factor authentication codes to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.\n\nEven better, these apps can manage passkeys to help you log in to your online accounts. Passkeys eliminate the need to remember passwords, and are far more resistant to phishing attacks that could compromise your accounts. \n\nYou should strongly consider enabling encryption on your data backups. This includes your iCloud Backup, and backups of your messaging apps such as Telegram or WhatsApp. Encryption makes it far less likely for an unauthorized party to read what's on your iPhone, as the data is totally scrambled without the key—which, in this case, is either your password or PIN. However, this is also where the danger lies. If you forget your backup password, even you won't be able to access the backup to restore data if you need to. Again, use a password manager to store these passwords so you'll never really forget.\n\nThis isn't necessarily an iPhone privacy tip as much as it is a general privacy hack, but it's worth mentioning. These days, trackers and hackers effectively use social media posts, photos, and videos to profile you. While there are plenty of steps you can take to limit the data you share on social media, you might not know you can remove identifying data from photos you post online. \"Exif\" data includes a host of stats about the hardware that took the image, including your camera make and model, shutter speed, focal length, and, perhaps most importantly, location. You don't have to avoid sharing photos to protect this data, however: just remove the exif data before posting.\n\nMost people are never going to need to use Lockdown Mode, because it's designed to protect your data when it's under attack from government surveillance or from espionage. That said, it's still worth knowing about this tool in case you ever face a cyberattack or if you suspect that your iPhone has been infected with spyware. Lockdown Mode disables message attachments, links and link previews, most incoming FaceTime calls, many Apple services, certain web technologies and fonts in Safari, and many other features.\n\nI repeat that this level of extreme protection is unnecessary for most people, but if you do need it one day, you can go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode to enable it.",

    "fullText": "Looking for a new iPhone or a good deal on a refurbished one? Samuel Gibbs has tested and rated Apple’s smartphones, including the new iPhone 17\n\nHow to make your smartphone last longer\n\nThe best iPhone may be the one you already own. There’s generally no need to buy a fresh phone just because new models have been released, as hardware updates are broadly iterative, adding small bits to an already accomplished package. But if you do want a replacement handset, whether new or refurbished, here are the best devices of the current crop of Apple smartphones.\n\nMany other smartphones are available besides the iPhone, but if you’re an Apple user and don’t fancy switching to Android, there are still a few choices to make. Whether your priority is the longest battery life, the best camera, the biggest screen or simply the optimal balance of features and price, there’s more to choose from in the Apple ecosystem than you may expect, especially after the release of the cheaper iPhone 16e and super-thin iPhone Air.\n\nWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us evaluate a phone, measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.\n\nWe use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.\n\nThe findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nBest iPhone for most people:\n\n iPhone 17\n\nBest iPhone for camera:\n\n iPhone 17 Pro\n\nBest iPhone for battery:\n\n iPhone 17 Pro Max\n\nBest thin and light iPhone:\n\n iPhone Air\n\nCheapest new iPhone:\n\n iPhone 16e\n\nThe base-model iPhone has been the best for most people for years, but this year the iPhone 17 is closer to the Pro models in features than ever before, making it an instant recommendation.\n\nWhile it may not look that different from last year’s iPhone 16, the screen has finally been upgraded to bring it up to par with the Pro iPhones. It is a 6.3in super-bright OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate – double previous standard iPhones – and ensures day-to-day scrolling and animations are smoother and more fluid than ever before. The screen’s glass is stated as being three times tougher than previous models, while the always-on display mode shows the time, notifications and music when idle – another feature that was Pro-only until now.\n\nThe rest of the iPhone 17 is fairly standard. It has the latest rapid A19 chip, but with twice the starting storage at 256GB of its predecessor – which should be more than enough for most people. The battery lasts just shy of two days between charges, and it fast-charges via USB-C or MagSafe/Qi2 wireless charging.\n\nThe phone is still relatively light and compact for a modern smartphone, with aluminium sides and a glass front and back, and it arrives with an IP68 water-resistance rating (down to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes). Along the edge of the device you’ll find the recently added action and camera control buttons, as well as the standard power and volume buttons.\n\nSporting main and ultra-wide options, the iPhone 17’s dual 48MP rear camera shoots great photos and videos across a range of lighting conditions, including automatic portrait capture and a fun macrophotography mode for closeups. It lacks a telephoto camera, however, limited to a 2x crop zoom on the main camera with digital zoom on top.\n\nA new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera on the front has some fancy tricks. It can automatically pan and zoom to fit in everyone for group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies while being held in portrait orientation.\n\nThe iPhone 17 runs the same iOS 26 as the rest of the iPhone family, which introduces Apple’s new glass-like design, improved spam filters and several other features. It also has Apple’s AI tools, which still lag behind the competition.\n\nThe biggest downside is that in a year where every other iPhone has had a redesign, the iPhone 17 looks the same as last year’s model.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe iPhone 17 offers almost everything that’s great about Apple’s Pro phones, including 256GB of storage, solid battery life, a fancy new screen and rapid performance, but in a lighter, cheaper package.\n\nBuy if: you want a great iPhone experience \nDon’t buy if: you want optical zoom on your camera or a new design\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 review: the Apple smartphone to get this year\n\nScreen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19\nStorage: 256 or 512GB\nCamera: 48MP main+UW; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 71.5 x 7.95 x 149.6mm (WDH)\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro takes all the good bits from the standard iPhone 17 and slaps them into a new design that stands out over years of similar-looking models from Apple.\n\nIt shares the same super-bright, 120Hz 6.3in OLED screen as the iPhone 17, but in a new aluminium unibody with smoother edges. A new camera “plateau” covers the full width of the top quarter of the phone’s rear, with a glass panel inlaid below it for wireless charging and magnetic accessories. New dark blue and bright orange colour options help it stand out, and despite its 204g weight, the 17 Pro remains pretty compact for a phone this capable.\n\nHousing Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip with a cooling system to allow it to run at peak performance for longer, the new Pro is great for games and other intensive tasks. Basic storage starts at 256GB, and the battery lasts about 42 hours between charges with general use. It fast-charges to 70% in 30 minutes via USB-C and supports 25W Qi2 wireless charging.\n\nThe biggest feature upgrade over the regular iPhone 17 is the Pro’s camera system. It’s made up of three 48MP sensors, including a larger main camera and a new 4x telephoto camera, which offers a 2x crop zoom to hit an effective 8x optical zoom to close the distance to objects. Combined, they capture excellent photos across a range of lighting conditions and environments. On the front, you’ll find the 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera for easy group shots.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThis is Apple’s best phone, with a new aluminium unibody design, its most powerful camera and top performance, all in a device that’s still easy to fit in a pocket.\n\nBuy if: you want a new design and the best camera in an iPhone but don’t want a huge display\nDon’t buy if: you want the longest battery life or biggest display on an iPhone\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 Pro review: different looks but still all about the zoom\n\nScreen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro\nStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\nCamera: 48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 71.9 x 8.75 x 150mm (WDH)\nWeight: 204g\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest and most expensive model this year. Super-sizing the regular 17 Pro, it has a massive 6.9in OLED screen on the front and a huge battery in the back.\n\nDesign-wise, it sports the same new aluminium unibody and top-performing A19 Pro chip of the new models, and a glorious screen that makes it excellent for gaming. It comes with at least 256GB of storage with options up to 2TB, great for those who want to use its triple rear camera for movie-making.\n\nStandout, though, is the Pro Max’s battery life, which at about 55 hours of general use will see the phone last well into a third day without needing a top-up.\n\nThe result of that extra capacity is that the 17 Pro Max is both huge and heavy. It would definitely benefit from using a Popsocket, handle, lanyard or other strap to help keep hold of it.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nApple’s longest-lasting, largest phone comes packing a powerful camera, top performance and everything good from the regular-sized 17 Pro.\n\nBuy if: you want super-long battery life and a massive screen \nDon’t buy if: you want a smaller, lighter or cheaper device\n\nScreen: 6.9in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro\nStorage: 256, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB\nCamera: 48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 78 x 8.75 x. 163.4mm (WDH)\nWeight: 231g\n\nThe iPhone Air is a bit of a wildcard in the current Apple phone lineup. It is an entirely new model built to be the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever made. The bulk of the body is just 5.64mm thick, although it feels even thinner thanks to its rounded titanium sides.\n\nIt weighs only 165g – 12g lighter than the already light iPhone 17 – but it also has a large, bright and 120Hz-smooth 6.5in OLED screen. It’s the kind of device that deserves to be used without a case, immediately feeling special the moment you pick it up.\n\nOn the rear, the camera plateau that stretches across the top of the device is also home to the phone’s components, with the rest of the body dedicated to the battery. It still has a version of Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip, at least 256GB of storage, and runs iOS 26 with all the features.\n\nThe super-slender frame creates three downsides for the Air. First, its battery lasts about 40 hours of general use, which isn’t terrible, but it’s shorter than other iPhones.\n\nSecond, it doesn’t have a nano Sim slot, relying entirely on downloadable eSims for connection to a phone provider. While most of the major networks support eSims, not all in the UK do, especially the more budget-friendly providers.\n\nHowever, the biggest compromise is that it only has a single 48MP camera on the rear, with no ultra-wide or telephoto options. While it still takes excellent photos, if you can’t walk back and forth to zoom in or out from your subject, you won’t be able to get the shot. You still get the new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera as the rest of the iPhone 17 line, though.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe iPhone Air is an exquisite piece of hardware that offers a big screen without the bulk or weight.\n\nBuy if: you want thinness above all else \nDon’t buy if: you want long battery life, multiple cameras or you can’t get an eSim\n\nRead our full iPhone Air review: Apple’s pursuit of absolute thinness\n\nScreen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU)\nStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\nCamera: 48MP rear; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 74.7 x 5.64 x 156.2mm (WDH)\nWeight: 165g\n\nThe cheapest new phone sold by Apple is the iPhone 16e, the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, but with a more modern design and chip.\n\nIt has an aluminium body, glass front and back, and a decent 6.1in OLED screen with the older-style notch from 2022’s iPhone 14. It’s thin, light and pretty compact for a modern phone, and is water-resistant like the rest of Apple’s iPhones.\n\nInside sits 2024’s A18 chip, paired with at least 128GB of storage. This hardware enables the Apple Intelligence features found across the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup – capabilities that won’t run on the iPhone 15 and older models – although none have as yet emerged as true killer features.\n\nThe iPhone 16e will last up to two days of general use and charges via USB-C. However, it lacks a few features common to other iPhones, including the Camera Control button, MagSafe on the back for accessories and charging, Wifi 7, and a handful of other specs. A bigger deal-breaker might be the single camera on the back, which is decent but lacks any ultra-wide or telephoto options.\n\nDespite costing about 25% less than the regular iPhone 17, the 16e still isn’t cheap, so better options can be found refurbished for similar or less money.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe 16e offers the modern iPhone experience with a fast chip and AI, but with features such as a dual camera and MagSafe missing to hit a lower price.\n\nBuy if: you want the cheapest new iPhone from Apple\nDon’t buy if: you are at all into photography or have MagSafe accessories\n\nRead our full iPhone 16e review: Apple’s cheapest new phone\n\nScreen: 6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A18\nStorage: 128, 256 or 512GB\nCamera: 48MP rear; 12MP front-facing\nDimensions: 71.5 x 7.8 x 146.7mm (WDH)\nWeight: 167g\n\nThe iPhone 16, released in 2024, sports the same design as the current iPhone 17, but misses the new Pro-grade screen and Centre Stage selfie camera. The rear camera is slightly lower grade, and storage capacity is smaller too. It was good on release and will continue to receive about five to six years of software support – but it’s fairly expensive at an RRP of £699 (128GB), so look for refurbished models or deals.\n\nIf your iPhone is running slow or the battery doesn’t last as long as it used to, there may be something you can do. Check your battery health in settings. If it’s past its best, a replacement costs £65 to £109 from Apple, or cheaper through third parties, and will give your iPhone a new lease of life. To speed things up, check you have enough free storage and clear out any unused apps or content, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music. Aim for at least 2GB of free space.\n\nIf your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’s iPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receive occasional security updates from Apple.\n\nBuying refurbished phones is better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.\n\nThere are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished and sold directly by Apple that come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chains CeX and Game and online stores such as musicMagpie and Envirofone. Marketplaces like Amazon and eBay and refurb specialist Back Market also have a wide range. And some phone operators, including O2, giffgaff, EE and Vodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.\n\nThe condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:\n\nGrade A – virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.\n\nGrade B – in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.\n\nGrade C – in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.\n\nGrade D – also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:\n\nBattery health – batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?\n\nCharging port – check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.\n\nButtons – do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.\n\nFingerprint scanner – is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.\n\nNetwork locks – check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.\n\nUnauthorised parts – not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.\n\nCheck it isn’t stolen – check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against a database of stolen devices through a service such as CheckMEND or similar.\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?\n\nAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.\n\nAn iPhone 13 mini, unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.\n\nFor more, read how to make your smartphone last longer and the best phone straps\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

User engagement crossed milestones, too, with more than 100,000 new devices activated on a daily basis, as well as over 88 million daily downloads and updates recorded for applications, according to the company.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

The privately held firm has since expanded HarmonyOS beyond smartphones and tablets.\n\nHuawei Pura 80 smartphones are displayed at the company's flagship store in Beijing, June 11, 2025.

That came roughly a year after it launched HarmonyOS 5 in late 2024.\n\nNotably, the latest version features a new function similar to Apple's AirDrop, which enables direct file transfers between Huawei and Apple devices for the first time.\n\nHarmonyOS accounted for 17 per cent of China's smartphone operating systems in the second quarter of the year, ahead of iOS's 16 per cent, maintaining its lead over Apple for the sixth consecutive quarter, according to data released by Counterpoint Research in September.\n\nHarmonyOS was China's second-largest mobile operating system behind Android, which had a dominant 66 per cent share in the quarter, according to Counterpoint.\n\nThe increasing adoption of HarmonyOS was largely attributed to Huawei's rebound in the domestic smartphone market.\n\nAccording to the latest data from research firm BCI, Huawei reclaimed its spot as China's top smartphone vendor in the last week of November and first week of December, overtaking Apple, following the launch of its flagship Mate 80 series.\n\nThe Mate 80 series, including the basic Mate 80, Mate 80 Pro, Mate 80 Pro Max and Mate 80 RS models, as well as the foldable Mate X7, was released in late November.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

    "description": "A downgrade in features and an upgrade in quality of life.",
    "fullText": "My concentration is shot. I know this because I've checked my phone four times while writing this opening paragraph. I'm addicted to my phone in a way that feels both embarrassing and completely normal, which is perhaps the most damning part. My phone feels essential for everything: my job requires Slack and email responsiveness, my hobbies live in apps and group chats, and even my downtime involves scrolling through feeds I don't actually enjoy.\n\nThese days, we tend to think of upgrades (in life, in tech, wherever) as adding features, but sometimes the real upgrade is eliminating. So I did something a little radical this year: I bricked my iPhone. Well, sort of. And it's been the best tech decision I've made in years.\n\nWe talk about phone addiction like it's a personal failing, but cut yourself some slack. Every app, every notification, every infinite scroll is designed by engineers whose job is to keep us locked in. As such, we've eliminated almost all empty space from our lives, filling every waiting moment with content consumption. Waiting for the train? Scroll. In line at the store? Scroll. Between tasks at work? Scroll.\n\nI can't afford to go full \"dumb-phone\", so I took a middle path: \"demoting\" my smartphone, so it functions like a dumb phone while retaining genuinely useful features like navigation, ride shares, and FaceTime. Here's what I did:\n\nI turned on grayscale mode. It's amazing how boring your phone becomes when it looks like an old newspaper. That dopamine-triggering red notification badge? Just gray. Instagram's carefully curated visual feast? Gray. Suddenly my phone looked as exciting as a filing cabinet.\n\nI deleted the time-consuming apps. I got rid of the primary social media apps, any news apps that were really just anxiety delivery systems, and more social media apps. If I wanted to check something, I'd have to do it on my computer, which added just enough friction to make me reconsider whether I actually cared.\n\nI turned off non-essential notifications. Actually, I turned off almost all notifications. No badges, no banners, no sounds. My phone became silent unless someone was actually calling me or texting me directly.\n\nI started physically separating myself from my phone during focused work. It went in another room, face down in a drawer, anywhere but within arm's reach. Out of sight, out of the dopamine loop.\n\nThis might sound embarrassing, but it's honest: at first, it felt like phantom limb syndrome. My thumb kept reaching for apps that weren't there. I'd pull out my phone in line at the coffee shop only to stare at a blank screen and think, \"Now what?\" The answer, it turned out, was nothing. And that nothing was exactly what I needed.\n\nThe first week was genuinely uncomfortable. My brain kept expecting hits that weren't coming. I felt anxious, ashamed, humbled, understimulated, almost itchy—which pretty much told me everything I needed to know about how deep the addiction ran.\n\nLuckily, the benefits rolled in faster than I expected. Within two weeks, I noticed I could read for longer stretches. I also think my work as a creative improved. Deep work—the kind where you're tackling genuinely hard problems—requires getting into a flow state. I need at least 20 minutes of uninterrupted focus to even enter that zone, and for me, an Instagram notification shatters it instantly. By removing the interruption infrastructure from my phone, I suddenly had whole mornings where I could think clearly.\n\nAlong with dumbing down my phone, I set an intention to become more observational again. I'd be waiting somewhere and instead of reaching for my phone, I'd just...look around. Watch people. Notice architectural details. Eavesdrop on conversations. Observe the weather shifting. It sounds small, but it completely changed my relationship with being in public spaces.\n\nI believe boredom is where creativity lives. When your mind isn't being constantly fed, it starts generating its own entertainment. I had ideas in the shower again. Real ideas, not just fragments borrowed from something I read online; I had original thoughts that surprised me, connections my brain made when it wasn't being force-fed content. This sounds mundane, but I promise, it's the opposite. This is how thinking actually works when you let it.\n\nEspecially with social media, I'd settled into this constant need to perform my life. While I still find this performance necessary to \"make it\" as a creative these days, I learned that most of my FOMO was an algorithm problem. You're not actually missing out on anything important; you're being shown a curated highlight reel designed to make you feel inadequate. Once you step out of that stream, you realize how much of it was manufactured anxiety. The things I thought I needed to keep up with turned out to be completely forgettable.\n\nMy bricked iPhone is a downgrade in features and an upgrade in life quality. That's the whole story, really.\n\nWe frame phone usage as a personal responsibility issue, but that's like blaming people for getting hooked on substances that were engineered to be addictive. Companies build their algorithms around persuasive technologies. They run A/B tests on features to maximize engagement. They know exactly what they're doing, and what they're doing is turning your attention into profit.\n\nLook, I'd love to go more radical with it, but I have limits. For work, I need to be responsive—Slack messages can't wait three hours. And I genuinely adore getting laughs in a group chat, which is a timely thing. Those moments of connection matter, and I'm not interested in becoming a total digital hermit.\n\nBut going forward, I'm desperate to keep getting my brain back. My ability to think deeply, pay attention, create meaningfully, and connect authentically—these aren't optional luxuries. They're the whole point.\n\nIf your phone feels like it owns you more than you own it, maybe your next upgrade isn't a new model. Maybe it's just making your current one a little more boring, a little less exciting, and a lot more brick-like. Your brain will thank you for it.",

    "fullText": "I wrote earlier this week about the important security updates Apple just rolled out in its 26.2 operating system updates. Among the security fixes are two zero-day bugs affecting WebKit, the browser engine that drives Safari. According to Apple, “this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.”\n\nPretty serious. There are also many other security fixes, including (as I mentioned) a major Messages privacy leak. When a serious security update comes out, users should update. It’s just the smart move.\n\nApple generally tries not to leave behind users who haven’t updated or can’t update to the latest OS version. Apple also usually offers security updates for past OS versions, and indeed, the company also released iOS 18.7.3 to address the same issues.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s an ugly catch: Numerous iPhone users have reported that if your iPhone is capable of running iOS 26 but you’re still back on iOS 18, you won’t be offered iOS 18.7.3. Instead, the only update option you’ll be given is iOS 26.2.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to avoid updating to iOS 26, from a dislike of Liquid Glass to software compatibility to a general wariness to install major updates for a while. This move effectively forces users to take the iOS 26 upgrade if they want the security updates. (iPhones not capable of running iOS 26 are offered the 18.7.3 update. iPads seem to be unaffected.)\n\nThis isn’t great. Apple shouldn’t be withholding a security update from people not willing to upgrade to the next OS version. I don’t know if this is an error, bug, or policy decision, and as of this writing, Apple hasn’t responded to my questions about this issue.\n\nSeveral users have reported to me that a workaround is to 7.3. Seems like a long way to go just to get security fixes.\n\nIn general, Apple is very good about supplying security updates to older operating systems, so all its users can stay protected. But in cases like this, users should never be forced to choose between ignoring a security update and updating to an OS version they’re not ready for.\n\nIf you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

    "title": "Apple's Latest iOS Update Includes a New Way to Receive Notifications",
    "description": "If your display turns bright, you have a new notification.",
    "fullText": "There are fewer and fewer hardware differences between iPhones and Androids as the years go on, but back in the day, that was far from the case. At one point, many major Android devices came with dedicated LEDs that would shine whenever you received a notification. It was a passive way to know whether you had something on your phone to attend to, without having to actually wake up the display and risk getting unnecessarily sucked into your device.\n\niPhones have never had this specific feature, but Apple included a workaround for anyone interested in a similar experience. For years, you've been able to dive into Accessibility settings to turn your iPhone's LED flash into a notification light. Any time you received a text, app notification, or call, your camera flash would go off, ensuring you didn't miss an important update. This can be helpful both those who are hard of hearing, and who wouldn't be able to rely on audible alerts, or anyone who keeps their phone on silent, but would like a visual cue that they have a new notification.\n\nFor the first time in years, Apple is updating its flash alerts feature. With iOS 26.2, which the company released on Friday, you now have the option to have your iPhone's display itself flash for new alerts. You can choose to make the display the only light that flashes, or to use the feature in tandem with the LED flash, which I think makes the most sense for people who like this option. That way, it won't matter whether your iPhone is face up or face down: You'll always see a light flash for new alerts one way or another.\n\nDisplay flash doesn't work like you might expect, especially if you've used LED flashes before. I thought my iPhone would flash a bright light on and off again a few times, mimicking how LED flash alerts works. Instead, when you get a new notification, the screen instantly increases the brightness for a few seconds, before lowering it again. It works—you're bound to notice your display jump in brightness if it isn't already maxed out—but it doesn't quite grab your attention as well as the LED flash.\n\nTo start, open the Settings app on your iPhone, then head to Accessibility. Scroll down to Hearing, then choose Audio & Visual. Scroll to the bottom of this page, then tap Flash for Alerts.\n\nIf you're running an older version of iOS, you'll only have the option to enable \"LED Flash.\" However, those running iOS 26.2 and newer will also see an option for \"Screen.\" Choose that option if you want the display to flash for new alerts, or \"Both\" to have both lights enabled.\n\nYou'll also find two choices that affect when these flash alerts go off, no matter which of the above options you pick. First, you can choose whether your iPhone will use flash alerts while locked. If you disable this option, you'll only see these light alerts when your iPhone is unlocked. Second, you can choose whether to use flash alerts in Silent Mode. I'd keep that setting enabled, since it seems most useful when your iPhone has no other way to alert you to new notifications.\n\nIt's also important to note that using an Apple Watch can complicate this feature a bit, at least in my experience. While giving this option a test, I had trouble getting alerts to come through on my locked phone without first going to my watch. If you have an Apple Watch, and its notifications mirror your iPhone's, you'll get the most out of this feature when your iPhone is unlocked.",

Mashing their names together to form a portmanteau, Flesser and Gardebäck became Simogo, and a consistently wonderful and forward-thinking games studios was born.\n\nSimogo Legacy Collection represents the Swedish indie studio’s first seven games, released across its first five years. Originally released for iPhone and iPad from 2010 to 2015, Apple’s constantly changing standards meant that Simogo, like all iOS developers, had to either regularly update their games to comply with the latest specifications, or see their games rendered unplayable. The only solutions are either to perpetually issue updates, or find a way to bring the mobile game experience to other platforms.\n\nThank goodness Simogo decided on the latter. Like all of the studio’s work, this anthology of games is smartly designed, its contents arranged on a homescreen made to look like a smartphone’s – except, you know, full of wonderful little games and not horrid social media apps. Care has been taken to make sure you can play the games no matter your setup – on a screen with a controller, at a PC with mouse and keyboard, in portrait or landscape orientations. (My preference was to play on a Switch, with the Joy-Cons removed to replicate the original mobile phone experience.)\n\nAnd oh, these games remain remarkable, all these years later. Things begin humbly with Kosmo Spin – a cute little arcade diversion, your only goal a high score. But Simogo’s ambition immediately begins to take shape with its next game, Bumpy Road, another arcade-style game about an old couple on a road trip, but infused with surprising whimsy and melancholy, a minimalist love story there for those who look for it. After this, the studio is off to the races, on an incredible streak of games that extends to this day – the devilish glee of Beat Sneak Bandit giving way to the melancholic, frightening folklore of Year Walk and the slick flair of Device 6.\n\nSimogo’s interests are wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. Flesser and Gardebäck have made a tradition of writing about the influences that inform each of their games, chronicling every project’s origin on their website. As a result, playing a Simogo game feels like getting a letter from some of your most eccentric friends, who, after spending a lot of time thinking about Patrick McGoohan’s The Prisoner, the work of graphic designer Sam Suliman, and Nintendo’s Virtual Boy, can’t help but write to you with a prose puzzle riffing on all these things using the typographic experimentation of House of Leaves.\n\nTimes have changed, and Simogo has expanded beyond Flesser and Gardebäck as their ambition has grown and brought them back to the realm of console games – such as the playable pop album Sayonara Wild Hearts, and their puzzle-mystery magnum opus Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. The brief, heady days of App Store brilliance are over; the world that allowed Simogo to flourish is now extinct. How fortunate it was that Simogo got the chance they did; that they’re still with us, and able to assemble this inspiring little collection we can play in perpetuity. These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.",

    "description": "There is a workaround for this bizarre bug.",
    "fullText": "If you open a picture in the Photos app on your iPhone, and it inexplicably starts turning red, I wouldn't blame you for being a bit concerned. After all, that's not supposed to happen, and out of all the colors your photos could randomly fade into, red is among the creepiest.\n\nWhile you contemplate what angry and vengeful god you might have crossed recently, understand that this isn't necessarily a problem affecting all, or even most, iPhone users and their photos. In fact, it doesn't appear to be affecting photos taken on iPhones at all. Rather, the users reporting this issue see it when zooming in on photos taken on Android devices. It seems a new hue has been added to the iPhone/Android divide: green bubbles, red pictures.\n\nIf this isn't happening on your own iPhone, you can see the issue play out in this Reddit post. User djenki0119 posted a screen recording of themself browsing photos on their iPhone that they had originally taken on a Samsung Galaxy S24. At first, the pictures appears totally normal. But once djenki0119 zooms in on each, it quickly turns a deep shade of red—almost as if you were looking at film developing in a dark room. This user has the same issue, only they took their photo on a Motorola Razr.\n\nAt this time, it's unclear what is actually causing the issue to occur. It usually doesn't matter what type of device took any particular image: Once it's in the Photos app, it should display normally. But there must be something about Android files that the iOS Photos app isn't reading correctly, at least when users zoom in on the image. As 9to5Mac highlights, it appears that something is adding a red filter to these images in the Photos app. Since this issue is only popping up recently, my guess is there's a bug within iOS 26, though there could be an issue with Android instead.\n\nFor what it's worth, I wasn't able to replicate the problem with photos I sent from my Pixel 8 Pro over to my iPhone. But perhaps there is some strange combination of hardware and software that results in this tinting: Maybe a photo taken on a certain type of Android device running a specific version of Android turns red on a certain iPhone model running a specific version of iOS.\n\nLuckily, you don't have to wait for Apple, Google, Samsung, or Motorola to issue a fix, depending on where the actual issue is coming from. To return your image to its proper color scheme, open it in the Photos app, tap \"Edit,\" then choose \"Revert.\" This restores the image to its original state, and removes the red filter that was unnecessarily overlayed on top of it.",

    "title": "These Two New iPhone Features Are Coming to iOS 26.3",
    "description": "Apple is already working on the sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "Just three days after Apple released iOS 26.2 to iPhones everywhere, the company is back at it with a new update. iOS 26.3 is official, though only for beta testers. Those brave enough to install Apple's unfinished software on their devices won't find an update packed to the brim with new features and changes, but they will stumble upon two key new features. The thing is, we already knew both of them were on the way.\n\nThis isn't the end all be all for the update, however: Since iOS 26.3 is so new, it's possible testers will discover additional features hidden within the update. In addition, Apple may add new changes in subsequent beta versions. I'll continue to update this article to reflect any new features that reveal themselves, but, until then, here are the two new features we know about.\n\nBack in September, we learned that Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the EU, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAfter three months, we are now getting our first official look at this feature. In this first iOS 26.3 beta, there is now a \"Notification Forwarding\" option in Notification settings. While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nKnowledge of iOS 26.3's second feature is not quite so old. In fact, we only learned about it last week. As it happens, Apple is working directly with Google on an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless.\n\nAs of last week, Google had already rolled out its first test of the feature to Android Canary, but it was nowhere to be found in Apple's betas. Now, we know what to expect: In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Here, iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device, where you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nThis isn't the flashiest beta Apple has ever shipped, but it is possible to install right now. Both the developer and public betas are now available, which means anyone interested can enroll their device in Apple's beta program to give 26.3 a try.\n\nHowever, know the risks before you do. Unfinished software could come with bugs and glitches that could impact your experience using your iPhone. If the software is particularly glitchy, you could lose data when downgrading back to iOS 26.2. If you do decide to install the beta, make a complete backup of your iPhone to a Mac or PC before you do.",

    "title": "How to Set Up Your Own Custom Focus Modes on iPhone",
    "description": "Don't sleep on this powerful iPhone feature.",
    "fullText": "The iPhone's Focus modes are perhaps its most underrated feature. Once customized, they can become incredibly powerful tools that put you in control of how your iPhone can grab your attention. They can take some time to set up, but it’s worth it. Once you've got everything squared away, you'll have timed boundaries from certain apps, people, and even your work, for that mythical work-life balance. Forget having a personal phone and a work phone—a couple of well-tuned Focus modes might be enough.\n\nWhat used to be Do Not Disturb on iPhone is now Focus mode, which comes with many more options. Open the Control Center and tap the Focus button to see a list of all available Focus modes. The familiar Do Not Disturb option will be up top, but you’ll also see helpful Focus modes premade by Apple, Sleep being a prominent example. If you have a device that supports Apple Intelligence, you’ll also see a mode called Reduce Interruptions, which automatically mutes all notifications except the really important ones. Other premade modes include Personal, Work, and Sleep, which you can all customize to your own liking.\n\nTo get the most out of Focus Modes, you should set some Focus modes for yourself. One for work and one for personal time would be a great place to start. Go to Settings > Focus and tap the Plus button at the top. Here, choose the Custom mode option to get the most flexibility. Give it a name, icon, and tap Next. Then, tap Customize Focus.\n\nThis is where you'll do most of your work. First, tap Choose People and select if you want to allow notifications from only a couple of people, or if you want to silence notifications from particular folks. If you’re setting up a Focus mode for personal time, you might want to stop notifications only from your boss and colleagues. Choose the people to allow, and tap Next. Then, choose who is allowed to call you. You can limit it to just your Favorites, or only a handful of people.\n\nThen, tap Choose Apps and follow the same process for apps as well, either allowing notifications from some apps, or only silencing notifications from particular apps. For example, if you’re setting up a Focus mode for personal time, you might want to disable notifications from work apps like Slack, Teams, Gmail, and more. Tap into the Options menu, and you can also choose to show silenced notifications on the Lock Screen, or to dim the lock screen every time that Focus mode is enabled.\n\nNext, take some time to customize what you see when a Focus mode is enabled. Apple will let you choose a distinct Lock screen, Home screen and even an Apple Watch watch face per Focus mode. For example, your work Focus can feature just your calendar and to do list. This will go a long way towards cementing the Focus state in your mind. For example, when I’m in my Writing Focus mode, my home screen is devoid of everything, including my tasks widget and communication apps.\n\nThen, you’ll see a Set a Schedule section. Here, you can turn on a Smart Activation feature that will automatically enable a Focus mode depending on your location, app usage and so on. This has been hit or miss for me, so I would advise you to avoid it for the most reliable results. But you can definitely create a manual schedule using the Add Schedule button. Here, You can trigger a Focus mode to automatically start or stop at a certain time of day.\n\nYou can even use Focus Filters to further customize exactly what apps can show you when you’re in a Focus mode. For example, you can choose to only see your work calendar when you’re in your work Focus, but not your other calendars. These filters work for Apple’s apps and even third-party apps.\n\nLastly, you can choose to enable the Intelligent Breakthrough & Silencing feature that's found at the top of the Focus page. If you have an iPhone with Apple Intelligence enabled, you'll see this setting. It uses on-device intelligence to allow priority notifications to interrupt you even when you're in silent mode. This goes over all other customizations that you might've done. But, being an Apple Intelligence feature, its reliability can be a bit iffy. Based on personal experience, I would recommend you take the time to fully customize the Focus mode to your liking instead of handing some of that work over to Apple Intelligence, as it gets things wrong for me fairly often.",

    "fullText": "On Friday, Apple dropped iOS 26.2. Despite being the third update in the iOS 26 era, 26.2 still adds some interesting and useful new features, like alarms for reminders and refinements to the Sleep Score on Apple Watch.\n\nUpdates aren't all about the features, however. Apple typically includes a number of security patches with its software releases as well, which makes each update important to install. You don't always need to install the latest version of iOS or macOS to benefit from these security patches, either: Apple usually releases important security patches for some older versions of its software. iPhones running iOS 18 can install the same security patches as those running iOS 26, as can Mac users running macOS Sequoia or Sonoma, rather than Tahoe.\n\nAll that to say, Apple's update today comes with a series of patches you'll want to install on your iPhone—no matter what software version you're currently running. This particular release ships with 25 patches, and while some of them seem only pertinent to software developers, others are plainly serious.\n\nPerhaps most importantly from a security perspective, this release includes two patches for potential zero-day vulnerabilities. Zero-day flaws are especially dangerous as they are either publicly disclosed or actively exploited before a developer has a chance to issue a patch—leaving users vulnerable to attack.\n\nBoth flaws (CVE-2025-43529 and CVE-2025-14174) affect WebKit, Apple's platform for developing Safari and web browsers on iPhone. Before Apple patched these issues, bad actors could present users with malicious web content. Once the user processes it on their iPhone, it could lead to arbitrary code execution, which, essentially, allows the bad actor to run whatever code they want on your iPhone. Apple says it is aware of reports that these two flaws may have been exploited in \"an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals\" in versions of iOS older than iOS 26.\n\nThis is not the first time Apple has patched flaws with this warning. Due to the iPhone's popularity, these flaws are valuable to governments and other large-scale actors that target high-profile individuals, like journalists and politicians. Apple will even send these users warnings when their iPhone has been identified in such an attack. While the risk is low that the average iPhone user will be targeted in one of these campaigns, it's not impossible, which means it's important to update as soon as a patch is available. These apply to other Apple devices too, like Macs, so update all devices as soon as possible.\n\nWhile those two flaws are the most important of the bunch to fix, there are others here that you'll want to fix ASAP. One of the first to jump out at me was a \"Calling Framework\" flaw that allows bad actors to spoof their FaceTime caller ID. With the rise of AI scams, bad actors could create an AI voice that sounds like someone you know, and spoof their contact so it looks like they're calling you over FaceTime audio. This update patches that possibility—at least, as far as spoofing is concerned.\n\nSpeaking of FaceTime, this update also patches a flaw that sometimes reveals password fields when remotely controlling a device over FaceTime. If you were sharing your screen with someone over a video call, they might be able to see when you typed in your password and use that against you. There's also a patch for an issue that allowed an app to see other apps you had installed on your device—a major privacy and security vulnerability.\n\nIf you use the Photos' app Hidden feature to hide sensitive pictures you don't want others to see, you'll want to install this update ASAP, too: Previous versions of iOS contained a bug that made it possible to view these hidden photos without authentication.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing all of Apple's security patches in this update, the full release notes are as follows:\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: An app may be able to access sensitive payment tokens\n\nDescription: A permissions issue was addressed with additional restrictions.\n\nCVE-2025-46288: floeki, Zhongcheng Li from IES Red Team of ByteDance\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: Processing a file may lead to memory corruption\n\nDescription: The issue was addressed with improved bounds checks.\n\nCVE-2025-43539: Michael Reeves (@IntegralPilot)\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: An attacker may be able to spoof their FaceTime caller ID\n\nDescription: An inconsistent user interface issue was addressed with improved state management.\n\nCVE-2025-46287: an anonymous researcher, Riley Walz\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: Multiple issues in curl\n\nDescription: This is a vulnerability in open source code and Apple Software is among the affected projects.

    "title": "All the New Features in iOS 26.2",
    "description": "Apple's latest update for your iPhone is now available.",
    "fullText": "Apple dropped iOS 26.1 on Nov. 3, introducing some small but meaningful changes to iPhones. But after changing how alarms work, and adding options to adjust the look of Liquid Glass, the company is back at it with another update: iOS 26.2.\n\nAs you might expect, iOS 26.2 isn't a major update. Apple clearly added most of the features and changes it had in mind with iOS 26, and a handful of new features and adjustments with iOS 26.1. Still, iOS 26.2 does bring some changes. Here's what's new:\n\nWith iOS 26.1, Apple added an option to adjust the look of Liquid Glass. With it, you can choose from two options: \"Clear,\" the iconic Liquid Glass look, or \"Tinted,\" which increases opacity of the elements, and turns Liquid Glass into more of a Frosted Glass.\n\nWhile this is a helpful addition for users who didn't like the look of Liquid Glass, some wanted Apple to go a step further, and add a slider to more finely adjust the look of the glassy design. It seems Apple has done just that with iOS 26.2, but not for the system-wide Liquid Glass UI. Instead, with this new version, you get a slider to adjust the look of your Lock Screen clock:\n\nIn addition, it looks like Apple adjusted the Liquid Glass animations throughout iOS. As you can see from the post below, the animation is responsive and bouncy, a bit closer to the demos we saw back in June:\n\nApple is also continuing to update its apps with Liquid Glass. With 26.2, the Measure app is next. The new update adds Liquid Glass bubbles to the app's Level function, which replaces the existing solid white circles.\n\nReminders are an indispensable part of my iPhone. I rely on them on a daily basis to make sure I keep up with important tasks. However, reminder alerts are as present as any other notification on your iPhone. If you frequently watch your notifications, that's just fine, but if you don't check your iPhone so much, or you use Focuses or Do Not Disturb, it can be easy to miss a reminder—and easy to forget to do the thing you were reminding yourself to do.\n\niOS 26.2 has a solution: alarms for reminders. When you set a reminder as \"Urgent\" while running iOS 26.2, you'll see a pop-up asking for permission to to schedule alarms and timers. The idea is, rather than rely on a simple alert, the Reminders app can play an alarm when your reminder is due. I imagine that will help avoid forgotten reminders: You might miss a short ping, but you probably will hear if your iPhone is continuously blaring.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch running watchOS 26, you can take advantage of Apple's new Sleep Score feature. Sleep Score looks at your sleep duration, bedtime, and sleep interruptions to assign you a score to summarize how well you slept. Duration can go up to 50 points, bedtime up to 30, and interruptions up to 20, culminating in a highest possible score of 100.\n\nWith iOS 26.2 and watchOS 26.2, Apple is adjusting the Sleep Score metrics, which should hopefully make it a bit more accurate for users at a glance. Here's how it changed, as noted by MacRumors:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nIn addition, \"Excellent\" is now \"Very High,\" to keep the naming scheme more consistent.\n\niOS 26.2 introduces a new \"Manage Known AirDrop Contacts\" section, that reads: \"You will automatically appear for 30 days to people you have shared a one-time code with.\" As this setting suggests, you may be able to share a one-time code with another user, after which time you will be able to easily find each other over AirDrop for 30 days.\n\nThis new iOS 26.2 feature can update you about \"imminent threats,\" like floods, emergencies, and natural disasters. You'll see maps of affected locations, and links to relevant safety information. This feature is also available on watchOS 26.2.\n\nApple added a new feature to Accessibility Settings that lets you choose to have the device screen flash whenever you receive a notification.\n\nFreeform, Apple's digital whiteboard app, doesn't get the attention it deserves. With iOS 26.2, tables in Freeform can now store text, images, documents, and drawings. Cells also \"intelligently\" resize to fit.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.1, Apple brought back Slide Over. This useful multitasking feature lets you assign one app window that you can easily bring forward or dismiss from the side of the screen. It's great for quick glances at apps like Messages, Music, or social media platforms—things you don't always need on-screen.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.2, Apple is continuing to bring back Slide Over functionality. The company brought back drop and drop, which lets you pick up an app and drop it on top of your active Slide Over window to instantly turn that chosen app to a Slide Over view.\n\nApple is introducing three new changes for the Podcasts app in iOS 26.2. You'll see all three in a pop-up menu the first time you open the app post-update.\n\nFirst, all Podcasts in English will come with chapters by default. Podcasters can include these chapters themselves, or, if none are available, the app will generate them automatically with AI. If podcasters don't want their episodes to have chapters, they can disable the feature on their end. The app will also collect any podcasts mentioned during the show you're listening to in one location, so you can easily find those other podcasts if interested. Similarly, podcasters can roundup any links they want to share in one place, including with timestamped entries in the transcript of the episode. The app may automatically create these links too, based on the contents of the episode.\n\nWhen you update your iPhone to 26.2, you might notice three changes in the Games app. First there are new sorting options, including filters that sort by game size, show what games your friends are playing, and which games support challenges. In addition, the app now has expanded controller compatibility for navigating the app, so you should be able to continue using the controller rather than touch controls when in Games. Finally, your challenge scores will update in real-time as you play games.\n\nFor the last five years, Apple has let you pin your favorite contacts and group chats to the top of the Messages app. With iOS 26, Apple updated CarPlay to support this feature, but didn't give you any say in the matter. If you had pinned chats on your iPhone, CarPlay would mirror that, even if you would prefer to drive without the pinned chats on your car's display.\n\nWith 26.2, however, Apple is giving you the option to disable pinned messages for CarPlay. The option appears as a simple \"Pinned Conversations\" toggle in CarPlay settings.\n\nLive Translation is a promising new feature for AirPods owners running iOS 26. When you're wearing your AirPods, and you start talking to someone who speaks a different language than you do, your iPhone will translate their words on the fly, and you'll hear what they're saying in your target language through your AirPods. Apple isn't the first company to offer this feature and it isn't perfect, but it's great to have it nonetheless.\n\nHowever, EU users running iOS 26 or iOS 26.1 can't use Live Translation. Apple cited the region's Digital Markets Act as the reason it couldn't bring Live Translation to the EU, but the company seems to have sorted out whatever logistical and bureaucratic issues it had been dealing with: Now that iOS 26.2 is here, AirPods users in the EU will be able to use Live Translation, too.\n\nWhile not technically an iOS 26.2 feature, Apple has one major update to macOS with version 26.2: The company has added an \"Edge Light\" feature, which adds a ring of light around your video call window. Apple says the feature uses your Mac's Neural Engine to identify your face and analyze your movements, which allows the light to adjust as needed. If you move your cursor to access something else on your screen, for example, the light will dim so you can see what you're doing. You can also change the light's hue, if you prefer something warmer or cooler for your calls.\n\nWhether this feature will be good enough to replace a dedicated light, like the popular Ring Light, remains to be seen. But this is an interesting and unexpected feature from Apple, and I'm curious to try it for myself when it launches.",

    "title": "Google Maps Will Now Automatically Save Your Parking Spot on iPhone",
    "description": "Wasn't this a thing already?",
    "fullText": "Forgetting where you parked your car isn't just a sitcom trope—though it does make for classic TV. Even in the age of the smartphone, it's all too easy to walk away from your car and retain zero memory of where you left it. As it happens, Google Maps has a solution—provided you have an iPhone.\n\nSo long as you're running the app on an Apple device, Google Maps can automatically remember where you parked and display that information on the map. There's no need to mark the location yourself, tell the app to save your spot, or take a picture of the cross streets in case you forget: You can simply glance at the screen to find a \"You parked here\" label.\n\nThe thing is, while some are reporting this feature is relatively new to them, others suggest it's been out for a while. What gives?\n\nThis feature works if you connect your iPhone to your car, whether via Bluetooth, CarPlay, or a USB cable. When you disconnect your iPhone from your car, Google Maps will assume you've parked, and will automatically mark that location on the map. The feature will also work if you give Google Maps permission to access your Motion & Fitness data, which allows the app to tell when you've started and stopped driving. (You can check on this setting from Google Maps' in-app settings: Head to Navigation, then, under \"Automatically save parking,\" tap Let maps use your motion to save your parking.)\n\nYou can also choose to set Google Maps' location permissions to \"Always,\" which gives the app persistent access to your location data, and also lets it figure out when you've stopped your car. You can change this option on your iPhone by navigating t0 Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Google Maps.\n\nThis feature is genuinely great, and I'm happy Google Maps supports it—even if Android users are inexplicably being excluded for now. But you might also be wondering to yourself, wasn't this already a feature? It doesn't sound all that new. Yet you might have even seen a flurry articles like this one today, all reporting on this \"new\" Google Maps parking feature.\n\nAs it turns out, the answer is a bit complicated. The coverage today all references this announcement on LinkedIn from Google Maps senior product manager Rio Akasaka—only that post is, according to LinkedIn, a month old. Some of the comments are more recent, but others appear to be from the original posting date.\n\nPotentially adding to the confusion, other navigation apps, like Apple Maps, already support automatically saving your parking spot, and while Google Maps has also had an option to save your parking spot for some time, it previously wasn't automatic. If you wanted the app to remember where you stopped, you needed to tap your blue dot on the map and choose \"Save your parking.\" That's how it still is on Android, since the automatic feature only works on iOS.\n\nLooking through the comment sections on articles from outlets like The Verge or MacRumors, some users insist they've had this feature for some time—well before that month-old LinkedIn announcement. This commenter says they've had the feature for years, while this one claims they've had it for \"ages.\" So what gives? Have at least some iPhone users have had this feature for years? It is possible Google has been testing out the feature with smaller subsets of users and only recently rolled it out en masse, but whether or not that actually happened is unclear at this time.\n\nI've reached out to Google for clarification about the timeline of this feature's implementation, and I will update this article if I get an answer. Until then, I can only hope Google is actively working on rolling out the feature to Android, as that really would be something new.",

    "description": "The EU welcomes Apple and Google's plans to enable a more seamless data transfer between iPhone and Android devices.",
    "fullText": "Apple and Google want to simplify data transfer between their iOS and Android platforms, support more data formats, and enable wireless transfer. The EU welcomes this step, stating: The Digital Markets Act is showing its effect.\n\nThe EU Commission has sent a statement to 9to5Mac. In it, a Commission spokesperson says about Apple and Google's cooperation in this area that it is an \"example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) benefits users and developers\".\n\nThe EU further states that this solution allows users to easily transfer data from iPhone to Android and vice versa when setting up a new device. According to the report, the transfer is intended to support \"many types of data\" – including contacts, calendar events, messages, photos, documents, Wi-Fi networks, passwords, and also data from third-party apps. Unlike previous solutions, the optimized method will also be wireless.\n\nAccording to the EU, the more seamless cross-platform data transfer follows the introduction of eSIM transfer by Apple and Google last October. Currently, however, this solution is only supported by a few network operators, but also by some outside the EU.\n\nBoth solutions are the direct result of the DMA, which \"requires effective data portability\" from certain services – including iOS and Android, the EU statement continues. Apple has summarized its work on this project in its DMA compliance reports from March 2024 and March 2025. Furthermore, the solutions are possible through extensive technical work and collaboration between Apple and Google, as well as through intensive discussions with the Commission over the past two years, according to the EU spokesperson.\n\nUnlike numerous features that Apple offers exclusively to its customers in the EU, such as alternative marketplaces, the seamless data transfer between platforms will be provided worldwide. For Apple, the solution is likely to be a win to attract new customers from Google's Android. This could, of course, also happen the other way around, with Google poaching from Apple. For consumers, the new solution means no longer being necessarily trapped in one of the two platform worlds.\n\nIncidentally, Apple will have to open up its iOS and iPadOS even further in the future, so that headphones and smartwatches, for example, work more seamlessly with the operating systems. These requirements are not at all to the company's liking, and it wanted to prevent this. The iPhone maker and Google are also not big fans of the Digital Markets Act: Apple would prefer to abolish the law, Google wishes for a reset, as it causes significant collateral damage in its current form.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every iPhone User Should Know",
    "description": "Time to power up.",
    "fullText": "I'm routinely surprised by just how much technology Apple has managed to pack into the iPhone that I can carry in the palm of my hand. What's even more surprising is that underneath the layers, there's even more than what meets the eye. There's a better, faster way to use the keyboard, there's a faster way to select unread emails to archive, there are better ways to browse the web than just the usual Safari experience, and you can get way better photos out of the iPhone Pro cameras than what the stock Camera app shows you.\n\nThe iPhone has become such a default product in all our lives that we just take it for granted. Yes, it's a great way to stay in touch with friends and coworkers, to capture moments, and to doomscroll the night away. But spend some more time, and there's a whole new iPhone experience just waiting for you that will truly transform how your iPhone looks and works.\n\nApple installs the Shortcuts app on every device and even offers pre-built shortcut automations that you can install from the Gallery. But the fun starts when you explore the very active Shortcuts community online and start to integrate Automations into the mix.\n\nApple’s Shortcuts app lets you create automations that automatically follow pre-defined steps. They can be used to resize images, compress files, convert data, and even control aspects of your smartphone. For example, you can create an automation that automatically enables a VPN when you step out of your home, or sends a message to your partner when you leave work. Looking to get started? We have a list of seven automations that I feel every iPhone user should install.\n\nI’m a huge fan of custom widgets. Whenever someone picks up my iPhone, the response is usually something like, \"Your iPhone doesn’t look like a regular iPhone.\" That’s down to custom widgets that show the time, day, my appointments, the weather, my tasks, and more. The world of custom iPhone widgets is huge, and if you just want to dip your toes in, I would suggest you start with the Widgetsmith app, which lets you customize multiple widgets with the same theme and fonts. All together, it looks really aesthetically pleasing. When you’re ready, you can dive in with the Widgy app, where you can import and customize thousands of interactive widgets.\n\nThe iPhone has a hidden button, and it’s on the back of your iPhone. It’s an accessibility feature that you can access via Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap. You can then assign any app, shortcut, or action to either the Double Tap or Triple Tap gesture. It’s a great way to trigger Shortcuts automations, or to simply bring up the selfie camera. I personally find that the double-tap gesture has a tendency to misfire sometimes, and the triple-tap gesture is a lot more reliable.\n\nIf you don’t use Safari extensions, you’re sleeping on unrealized potential. Just like on the Mac, the Safari browser on the iPhone also supports extensions. And you can use extensions to do some really cool things, like blocking all ads and trackers (of course), but also to force every website to be in dark mode, all the time. You’ll also find extensions to improve the Reddit browsing experience and to take complete control of all the elements on the websites you use frequently.\n\nUsing a third-party browser, like Vivaldi, is a very power-user move. All third-party browsers on iOS are technically variations of Safari, as Apple forces developers to build their browsers on Safari's WebKit platform. However, these third-party browsers can include unique features that Safari doesn't. Vivaldi, for example, offers desktop-class tab browsing, including tab groups and pinned tabs. Then there’s Orion, which can run desktop-class extensions from Firefox and Chrome Web Store on your iPhone (something that Safari can’t do). And if you don’t like Safari’s new interface, try out Quiche, which is a completely customizable browser.\n\nFocuses have the potential to transform how your iPhone looks and works, based on your location, time, day, or the task at hand. It’s time to go beyond Do Not Disturb and embrace everything that Apple's Focuses can do.\n\nIt would be a good idea for you to set up Focuses for Work, Personal Time, and Sleep. In each Focus, you can decide which apps can send notifications, and which friends or family members can contact you. You can even choose which home screens to show in particular Focus, choosing to hide widgets and apps depending on the Focus (no work stuff at all in Personal Time Focus, for example). Focus also integrates with Shortcuts and Automations, so you can trigger a Focus when you start a video call on your Mac or reach a particular location (like your workplace). Go to Settings > Focus to get started.\n\nYou’ll be familiar with all the usual iPhone gestures, like swiping up from the Home bar, or tapping the top edge of the iPhone to instantly scroll to the top. But the iPhone has a lot more hidden gestures that can really speed things up. If you see a long list, try to swipe down with two fingers to instantly start selecting items. This works really well in Mail, Phone, and other Apple apps, but is also supported by third-party apps. Next, in iOS 26, Apple added back gesture support that’s arguably better than Android. You can swipe in from anywhere on the left edge to quickly go back.\n\nYou can also cut, copy, and paste with a three-finger gesture. To copy something, pinch it with three fingers. To cut, do it twice. To paste something, do a three-finger spread gesture (opposite of the pinch).\n\nThe iPhone keyboard is more than what meets the eye. It has a built-in Slide to Type feature where you can glide your finger over the keys to type words. It works really well, especially when using the phone one-handed. There’s a virtual trackpad built in, too. Just tap and hold the Space bar and move your finger to move the cursor around.\n\nIf you find your keyboard too large to type on, you can also enable the one-handed keyboard from the Keyboard Settings button (tap and hold the Globe icon). From here, you can go to Keyboard Settings to enable a multi-lingual keyboard and to try out Text Replacement, where you can create shortcuts for expanding your frequently used text snippets. For example, you can type “adrs” to expand to your full home address.\n\nYou might not know this, but there’s a really neat document scanner built into the Notes app and the Files app. I prefer to use the Files app for this because I get to save a PDF directly in the folder that I want. Open the Files app, go to any folder, tap the three-dotted Menu icon, and choose the Scan Documents feature. There’s an Auto Shutter feature that’s enabled by default that will automatically scan each new page you put in front of your camera (if you find this annoying, you can disable it as well). Scan as many pages as you want, and tap the Done button. Then, give the document a name. And it’s now stored as a PDF in the folder. You can now send it to where it needs to go, or back it up using iCloud Drive.\n\nThe cameras on the iPhone Pro are truly stellar. But the Camera app is not. The default Camera app does too much computational photography for my taste, and has trouble focusing on elements exactly when I need to capture something small. Plus, the Pro cameras can shoot in Log in ProRes, and to fully take control of the visuals from your iPhone, you’ll need to step out of the Camera app.\n\nFor shooting video in the best light, Blackmagic is a great choice. Here, you get full manual control over both photos and videos, with film-grade presets (including the ability to create your own custom ones).\n\nIf that feels a bit too Pro, try using a third-party app to capture much better photos. My colleague Pranay has highlighted a couple of great options, with Halide Mark II topping the list (I agree, as well). Halide gives you a lot more control over the look of your photos. There’s also a Process Zero feature that removes all of Apple’s computational processes from the photos.",

    "description": "For reminders you really shouldn't forget.",
    "fullText": "Apple’s various apps and utilities are finally starting to talk to each other, and it’s great news for iPhone users. Last year, Apple added the ability to sync Reminders with Calendar, which added time-based reminders directly into your Calendar view—a feature I now regularly use. Now, with iOS 26.2, Apple is finally integrating Reminders with the Alarms app; you'll be able to set an accompanying alarm for any reminder.\n\nIf, like me, you tend to be forgetful—if you need a reminder for your reminder—this will be a handy feature. The alarm will sound, taking up your entire screen until you dismiss it. And yes, you can snooze it.\n\nTo get started, open the Reminder app, navigate to a task list, and either create a new reminder, or edit it. When you’re adding a date and time, you’ll see a new Urgent toggle. When you enable the Urgent mode, it will turn on an alarm that will go off when the reminder is due. The alarm will trigger even when your iPhone is in silent mode or in a Do Not Disturb Focus mode, so be careful when setting it up.\n\nWhen you enable this for the first time, you’ll get a connection request for integrating Reminders with Alarms. Here, tap Allow. If you don’t see this popup, or if you’ve dismissed it before, go to Settings > Apps > Reminders, and in the \"Allow Reminders to Access\" section, enable the Alarms toggle.\n\nWhen the reminder is due, you’ll see a full-screen reminder interface, with the reminder up top, and an option to slide to stop (using Apple’s new sliding interface for dismissing alarms, which you can disable if you want). You’ll also see a big blue Snooze button. This will snooze the reminder for nine minutes.\n\nWhether you hit the Snooze button or you use the slider to stop the alarm, Apple will add the Reminder to the top of the notifications list, as a Live Activity. You’ll see the reminder, with the snooze duration (if enabled), and the task. To actually complete the task, you’ll have to check it off from the Live Activity or the Reminders app.\n\nUnlike in the new alarm feature, there’s no way to edit the Snooze duration for reminders, or to disable the slider. If you don’t like the Snooze feature or the two-tap approach to completing reminders, you can switch it out for a Complete button instead. Go to Settings > Apps > Reminders and in the \"Urgent Reminders\" section, enable the Complete from Alarm feature. Now, when the alarm goes off, you’ll see two buttons instead: Slide to Stop and Complete. When you tap Complete, the alarm will disappear, and the task will be marked as Complete.",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",
