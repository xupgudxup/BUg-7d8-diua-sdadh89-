    "fullText": "HarmonyOS, Huawei Technologies' self-developed operating system, has crossed the threshold of 27 million users, a sign that the company's efforts to take on Apple's iOS and Google's Android are paying off.\n\nIn announcing the user numbers for its latest iterations - HarmonyOS 5 and HarmonyOS 6 - the Shenzhen-based tech giant referred to the milestone as a \"survival line\" for the company.\n\nThe platform also boasted an ecosystem of over 10 million developers. User engagement crossed milestones, too, with more than 100,000 new devices activated on a daily basis, as well as over 88 million daily downloads and updates recorded for applications, according to the company.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe latest figures, which come six years after the company first launched the operating system to counter Washington's sanctions on its access to Android, reflected how Huawei's efforts to develop an alternative for the world's largest smartphone manufacturers were paying off.\n\nHuawei has been transitioning its own devices to the operating system since 2021, ramping up efforts after the US placed the company on its Entity List in 2019 over national security concerns. The privately held firm has since expanded HarmonyOS beyond smartphones and tablets.\n\nHuawei Pura 80 smartphones are displayed at the company's flagship store in Beijing, June 11, 2025.

That came roughly a year after it launched HarmonyOS 5 in late 2024.\n\nNotably, the latest version features a new function similar to Apple's AirDrop, which enables direct file transfers between Huawei and Apple devices for the first time.\n\nHarmonyOS accounted for 17 per cent of China's smartphone operating systems in the second quarter of the year, ahead of iOS's 16 per cent, maintaining its lead over Apple for the sixth consecutive quarter, according to data released by Counterpoint Research in September.\n\nHarmonyOS was China's second-largest mobile operating system behind Android, which had a dominant 66 per cent share in the quarter, according to Counterpoint.\n\nThe increasing adoption of HarmonyOS was largely attributed to Huawei's rebound in the domestic smartphone market.\n\nAccording to the latest data from research firm BCI, Huawei reclaimed its spot as China's top smartphone vendor in the last week of November and first week of December, overtaking Apple, following the launch of its flagship Mate 80 series.\n\nThe Mate 80 series, including the basic Mate 80, Mate 80 Pro, Mate 80 Pro Max and Mate 80 RS models, as well as the foldable Mate X7, was released in late November.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

    "description": "A downgrade in features and an upgrade in quality of life.",
    "fullText": "My concentration is shot. I know this because I've checked my phone four times while writing this opening paragraph. I'm addicted to my phone in a way that feels both embarrassing and completely normal, which is perhaps the most damning part. My phone feels essential for everything: my job requires Slack and email responsiveness, my hobbies live in apps and group chats, and even my downtime involves scrolling through feeds I don't actually enjoy.\n\nThese days, we tend to think of upgrades (in life, in tech, wherever) as adding features, but sometimes the real upgrade is eliminating. So I did something a little radical this year: I bricked my iPhone. Well, sort of. And it's been the best tech decision I've made in years.\n\nWe talk about phone addiction like it's a personal failing, but cut yourself some slack. Every app, every notification, every infinite scroll is designed by engineers whose job is to keep us locked in. As such, we've eliminated almost all empty space from our lives, filling every waiting moment with content consumption. Waiting for the train? Scroll. In line at the store? Scroll. Between tasks at work? Scroll.\n\nI can't afford to go full \"dumb-phone\", so I took a middle path: \"demoting\" my smartphone, so it functions like a dumb phone while retaining genuinely useful features like navigation, ride shares, and FaceTime. Here's what I did:\n\nI turned on grayscale mode. It's amazing how boring your phone becomes when it looks like an old newspaper. That dopamine-triggering red notification badge? Just gray. Instagram's carefully curated visual feast? Gray. Suddenly my phone looked as exciting as a filing cabinet.\n\nI deleted the time-consuming apps. I got rid of the primary social media apps, any news apps that were really just anxiety delivery systems, and more social media apps. If I wanted to check something, I'd have to do it on my computer, which added just enough friction to make me reconsider whether I actually cared.\n\nI turned off non-essential notifications. Actually, I turned off almost all notifications. No badges, no banners, no sounds. My phone became silent unless someone was actually calling me or texting me directly.\n\nI started physically separating myself from my phone during focused work. It went in another room, face down in a drawer, anywhere but within arm's reach. Out of sight, out of the dopamine loop.\n\nThis might sound embarrassing, but it's honest: at first, it felt like phantom limb syndrome. My thumb kept reaching for apps that weren't there. I'd pull out my phone in line at the coffee shop only to stare at a blank screen and think, \"Now what?\" The answer, it turned out, was nothing. And that nothing was exactly what I needed.\n\nThe first week was genuinely uncomfortable. My brain kept expecting hits that weren't coming. I felt anxious, ashamed, humbled, understimulated, almost itchy—which pretty much told me everything I needed to know about how deep the addiction ran.\n\nLuckily, the benefits rolled in faster than I expected. Within two weeks, I noticed I could read for longer stretches. I also think my work as a creative improved. Deep work—the kind where you're tackling genuinely hard problems—requires getting into a flow state. I need at least 20 minutes of uninterrupted focus to even enter that zone, and for me, an Instagram notification shatters it instantly. By removing the interruption infrastructure from my phone, I suddenly had whole mornings where I could think clearly.\n\nAlong with dumbing down my phone, I set an intention to become more observational again. I'd be waiting somewhere and instead of reaching for my phone, I'd just...look around. Watch people. Notice architectural details. Eavesdrop on conversations. Observe the weather shifting. It sounds small, but it completely changed my relationship with being in public spaces.\n\nI believe boredom is where creativity lives. When your mind isn't being constantly fed, it starts generating its own entertainment. I had ideas in the shower again. Real ideas, not just fragments borrowed from something I read online; I had original thoughts that surprised me, connections my brain made when it wasn't being force-fed content. This sounds mundane, but I promise, it's the opposite. This is how thinking actually works when you let it.\n\nEspecially with social media, I'd settled into this constant need to perform my life. While I still find this performance necessary to \"make it\" as a creative these days, I learned that most of my FOMO was an algorithm problem. You're not actually missing out on anything important; you're being shown a curated highlight reel designed to make you feel inadequate. Once you step out of that stream, you realize how much of it was manufactured anxiety. The things I thought I needed to keep up with turned out to be completely forgettable.\n\nMy bricked iPhone is a downgrade in features and an upgrade in life quality. That's the whole story, really.\n\nWe frame phone usage as a personal responsibility issue, but that's like blaming people for getting hooked on substances that were engineered to be addictive. Companies build their algorithms around persuasive technologies. They run A/B tests on features to maximize engagement. They know exactly what they're doing, and what they're doing is turning your attention into profit.\n\nLook, I'd love to go more radical with it, but I have limits. For work, I need to be responsive—Slack messages can't wait three hours. And I genuinely adore getting laughs in a group chat, which is a timely thing. Those moments of connection matter, and I'm not interested in becoming a total digital hermit.\n\nBut going forward, I'm desperate to keep getting my brain back. My ability to think deeply, pay attention, create meaningfully, and connect authentically—these aren't optional luxuries. They're the whole point.\n\nIf your phone feels like it owns you more than you own it, maybe your next upgrade isn't a new model. Maybe it's just making your current one a little more boring, a little less exciting, and a lot more brick-like. Your brain will thank you for it.",

    "fullText": "I wrote earlier this week about the important security updates Apple just rolled out in its 26.2 operating system updates. Among the security fixes are two zero-day bugs affecting WebKit, the browser engine that drives Safari. According to Apple, “this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.”\n\nPretty serious. There are also many other security fixes, including (as I mentioned) a major Messages privacy leak. When a serious security update comes out, users should update. It’s just the smart move.\n\nApple generally tries not to leave behind users who haven’t updated or can’t update to the latest OS version. Apple also usually offers security updates for past OS versions, and indeed, the company also released iOS 18.7.3 to address the same issues.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s an ugly catch: Numerous iPhone users have reported that if your iPhone is capable of running iOS 26 but you’re still back on iOS 18, you won’t be offered iOS 18.7.3. Instead, the only update option you’ll be given is iOS 26.2.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to avoid updating to iOS 26, from a dislike of Liquid Glass to software compatibility to a general wariness to install major updates for a while. This move effectively forces users to take the iOS 26 upgrade if they want the security updates. (iPhones not capable of running iOS 26 are offered the 18.7.3 update. iPads seem to be unaffected.)\n\nThis isn’t great. Apple shouldn’t be withholding a security update from people not willing to upgrade to the next OS version. I don’t know if this is an error, bug, or policy decision, and as of this writing, Apple hasn’t responded to my questions about this issue.\n\nSeveral users have reported to me that a workaround is to 7.3. Seems like a long way to go just to get security fixes.\n\nIn general, Apple is very good about supplying security updates to older operating systems, so all its users can stay protected. But in cases like this, users should never be forced to choose between ignoring a security update and updating to an OS version they’re not ready for.\n\nIf you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

    "title": "Apple's Latest iOS Update Includes a New Way to Receive Notifications",
    "description": "If your display turns bright, you have a new notification.",
    "fullText": "There are fewer and fewer hardware differences between iPhones and Androids as the years go on, but back in the day, that was far from the case. At one point, many major Android devices came with dedicated LEDs that would shine whenever you received a notification. It was a passive way to know whether you had something on your phone to attend to, without having to actually wake up the display and risk getting unnecessarily sucked into your device.\n\niPhones have never had this specific feature, but Apple included a workaround for anyone interested in a similar experience. For years, you've been able to dive into Accessibility settings to turn your iPhone's LED flash into a notification light. Any time you received a text, app notification, or call, your camera flash would go off, ensuring you didn't miss an important update. This can be helpful both those who are hard of hearing, and who wouldn't be able to rely on audible alerts, or anyone who keeps their phone on silent, but would like a visual cue that they have a new notification.\n\nFor the first time in years, Apple is updating its flash alerts feature. With iOS 26.2, which the company released on Friday, you now have the option to have your iPhone's display itself flash for new alerts. You can choose to make the display the only light that flashes, or to use the feature in tandem with the LED flash, which I think makes the most sense for people who like this option. That way, it won't matter whether your iPhone is face up or face down: You'll always see a light flash for new alerts one way or another.\n\nDisplay flash doesn't work like you might expect, especially if you've used LED flashes before. I thought my iPhone would flash a bright light on and off again a few times, mimicking how LED flash alerts works. Instead, when you get a new notification, the screen instantly increases the brightness for a few seconds, before lowering it again. It works—you're bound to notice your display jump in brightness if it isn't already maxed out—but it doesn't quite grab your attention as well as the LED flash.\n\nTo start, open the Settings app on your iPhone, then head to Accessibility. Scroll down to Hearing, then choose Audio & Visual. Scroll to the bottom of this page, then tap Flash for Alerts.\n\nIf you're running an older version of iOS, you'll only have the option to enable \"LED Flash.\" However, those running iOS 26.2 and newer will also see an option for \"Screen.\" Choose that option if you want the display to flash for new alerts, or \"Both\" to have both lights enabled.\n\nYou'll also find two choices that affect when these flash alerts go off, no matter which of the above options you pick. First, you can choose whether your iPhone will use flash alerts while locked. If you disable this option, you'll only see these light alerts when your iPhone is unlocked. Second, you can choose whether to use flash alerts in Silent Mode. I'd keep that setting enabled, since it seems most useful when your iPhone has no other way to alert you to new notifications.\n\nIt's also important to note that using an Apple Watch can complicate this feature a bit, at least in my experience. While giving this option a test, I had trouble getting alerts to come through on my locked phone without first going to my watch. If you have an Apple Watch, and its notifications mirror your iPhone's, you'll get the most out of this feature when your iPhone is unlocked.",

Tired of the fussy nature of console development, the pair would stake their claim on Apple’s App Store, which in 2010 was regarded as one of the most exciting frontiers in games. Mashing their names together to form a portmanteau, Flesser and Gardebäck became Simogo, and a consistently wonderful and forward-thinking games studios was born.\n\nSimogo Legacy Collection represents the Swedish indie studio’s first seven games, released across its first five years. Originally released for iPhone and iPad from 2010 to 2015, Apple’s constantly changing standards meant that Simogo, like all iOS developers, had to either regularly update their games to comply with the latest specifications, or see their games rendered unplayable. The only solutions are either to perpetually issue updates, or find a way to bring the mobile game experience to other platforms.\n\nThank goodness Simogo decided on the latter. Like all of the studio’s work, this anthology of games is smartly designed, its contents arranged on a homescreen made to look like a smartphone’s – except, you know, full of wonderful little games and not horrid social media apps. Care has been taken to make sure you can play the games no matter your setup – on a screen with a controller, at a PC with mouse and keyboard, in portrait or landscape orientations. (My preference was to play on a Switch, with the Joy-Cons removed to replicate the original mobile phone experience.)\n\nAnd oh, these games remain remarkable, all these years later. Things begin humbly with Kosmo Spin – a cute little arcade diversion, your only goal a high score. But Simogo’s ambition immediately begins to take shape with its next game, Bumpy Road, another arcade-style game about an old couple on a road trip, but infused with surprising whimsy and melancholy, a minimalist love story there for those who look for it. After this, the studio is off to the races, on an incredible streak of games that extends to this day – the devilish glee of Beat Sneak Bandit giving way to the melancholic, frightening folklore of Year Walk and the slick flair of Device 6.\n\nSimogo’s interests are wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. Flesser and Gardebäck have made a tradition of writing about the influences that inform each of their games, chronicling every project’s origin on their website. As a result, playing a Simogo game feels like getting a letter from some of your most eccentric friends, who, after spending a lot of time thinking about Patrick McGoohan’s The Prisoner, the work of graphic designer Sam Suliman, and Nintendo’s Virtual Boy, can’t help but write to you with a prose puzzle riffing on all these things using the typographic experimentation of House of Leaves.\n\nTimes have changed, and Simogo has expanded beyond Flesser and Gardebäck as their ambition has grown and brought them back to the realm of console games – such as the playable pop album Sayonara Wild Hearts, and their puzzle-mystery magnum opus Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. The brief, heady days of App Store brilliance are over; the world that allowed Simogo to flourish is now extinct. How fortunate it was that Simogo got the chance they did; that they’re still with us, and able to assemble this inspiring little collection we can play in perpetuity. These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.",

    "description": "There is a workaround for this bizarre bug.",
    "fullText": "If you open a picture in the Photos app on your iPhone, and it inexplicably starts turning red, I wouldn't blame you for being a bit concerned. After all, that's not supposed to happen, and out of all the colors your photos could randomly fade into, red is among the creepiest.\n\nWhile you contemplate what angry and vengeful god you might have crossed recently, understand that this isn't necessarily a problem affecting all, or even most, iPhone users and their photos. In fact, it doesn't appear to be affecting photos taken on iPhones at all. Rather, the users reporting this issue see it when zooming in on photos taken on Android devices. It seems a new hue has been added to the iPhone/Android divide: green bubbles, red pictures.\n\nIf this isn't happening on your own iPhone, you can see the issue play out in this Reddit post. User djenki0119 posted a screen recording of themself browsing photos on their iPhone that they had originally taken on a Samsung Galaxy S24. At first, the pictures appears totally normal. But once djenki0119 zooms in on each, it quickly turns a deep shade of red—almost as if you were looking at film developing in a dark room. This user has the same issue, only they took their photo on a Motorola Razr.\n\nAt this time, it's unclear what is actually causing the issue to occur. It usually doesn't matter what type of device took any particular image: Once it's in the Photos app, it should display normally. But there must be something about Android files that the iOS Photos app isn't reading correctly, at least when users zoom in on the image. As 9to5Mac highlights, it appears that something is adding a red filter to these images in the Photos app. Since this issue is only popping up recently, my guess is there's a bug within iOS 26, though there could be an issue with Android instead.\n\nFor what it's worth, I wasn't able to replicate the problem with photos I sent from my Pixel 8 Pro over to my iPhone. But perhaps there is some strange combination of hardware and software that results in this tinting: Maybe a photo taken on a certain type of Android device running a specific version of Android turns red on a certain iPhone model running a specific version of iOS.\n\nLuckily, you don't have to wait for Apple, Google, Samsung, or Motorola to issue a fix, depending on where the actual issue is coming from. To return your image to its proper color scheme, open it in the Photos app, tap \"Edit,\" then choose \"Revert.\" This restores the image to its original state, and removes the red filter that was unnecessarily overlayed on top of it.",

    "title": "These Two New iPhone Features Are Coming to iOS 26.3",
    "description": "Apple is already working on the sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "Just three days after Apple released iOS 26.2 to iPhones everywhere, the company is back at it with a new update. iOS 26.3 is official, though only for beta testers. Those brave enough to install Apple's unfinished software on their devices won't find an update packed to the brim with new features and changes, but they will stumble upon two key new features. The thing is, we already knew both of them were on the way.\n\nThis isn't the end all be all for the update, however: Since iOS 26.3 is so new, it's possible testers will discover additional features hidden within the update. In addition, Apple may add new changes in subsequent beta versions. I'll continue to update this article to reflect any new features that reveal themselves, but, until then, here are the two new features we know about.\n\nBack in September, we learned that Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the EU, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAfter three months, we are now getting our first official look at this feature. In this first iOS 26.3 beta, there is now a \"Notification Forwarding\" option in Notification settings. While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nKnowledge of iOS 26.3's second feature is not quite so old. In fact, we only learned about it last week. As it happens, Apple is working directly with Google on an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless.\n\nAs of last week, Google had already rolled out its first test of the feature to Android Canary, but it was nowhere to be found in Apple's betas. Now, we know what to expect: In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Here, iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device, where you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nThis isn't the flashiest beta Apple has ever shipped, but it is possible to install right now. Both the developer and public betas are now available, which means anyone interested can enroll their device in Apple's beta program to give 26.3 a try.\n\nHowever, know the risks before you do. Unfinished software could come with bugs and glitches that could impact your experience using your iPhone. If the software is particularly glitchy, you could lose data when downgrading back to iOS 26.2. If you do decide to install the beta, make a complete backup of your iPhone to a Mac or PC before you do.",

    "title": "How to Set Up Your Own Custom Focus Modes on iPhone",
    "description": "Don't sleep on this powerful iPhone feature.",
    "fullText": "The iPhone's Focus modes are perhaps its most underrated feature. Once customized, they can become incredibly powerful tools that put you in control of how your iPhone can grab your attention. They can take some time to set up, but it’s worth it. Once you've got everything squared away, you'll have timed boundaries from certain apps, people, and even your work, for that mythical work-life balance. Forget having a personal phone and a work phone—a couple of well-tuned Focus modes might be enough.\n\nWhat used to be Do Not Disturb on iPhone is now Focus mode, which comes with many more options. Open the Control Center and tap the Focus button to see a list of all available Focus modes. The familiar Do Not Disturb option will be up top, but you’ll also see helpful Focus modes premade by Apple, Sleep being a prominent example. If you have a device that supports Apple Intelligence, you’ll also see a mode called Reduce Interruptions, which automatically mutes all notifications except the really important ones. Other premade modes include Personal, Work, and Sleep, which you can all customize to your own liking.\n\nTo get the most out of Focus Modes, you should set some Focus modes for yourself. One for work and one for personal time would be a great place to start. Go to Settings > Focus and tap the Plus button at the top. Here, choose the Custom mode option to get the most flexibility. Give it a name, icon, and tap Next. Then, tap Customize Focus.\n\nThis is where you'll do most of your work. First, tap Choose People and select if you want to allow notifications from only a couple of people, or if you want to silence notifications from particular folks. If you’re setting up a Focus mode for personal time, you might want to stop notifications only from your boss and colleagues. Choose the people to allow, and tap Next. Then, choose who is allowed to call you. You can limit it to just your Favorites, or only a handful of people.\n\nThen, tap Choose Apps and follow the same process for apps as well, either allowing notifications from some apps, or only silencing notifications from particular apps. For example, if you’re setting up a Focus mode for personal time, you might want to disable notifications from work apps like Slack, Teams, Gmail, and more. Tap into the Options menu, and you can also choose to show silenced notifications on the Lock Screen, or to dim the lock screen every time that Focus mode is enabled.\n\nNext, take some time to customize what you see when a Focus mode is enabled. Apple will let you choose a distinct Lock screen, Home screen and even an Apple Watch watch face per Focus mode. For example, your work Focus can feature just your calendar and to do list. This will go a long way towards cementing the Focus state in your mind. For example, when I’m in my Writing Focus mode, my home screen is devoid of everything, including my tasks widget and communication apps.\n\nThen, you’ll see a Set a Schedule section. Here, you can turn on a Smart Activation feature that will automatically enable a Focus mode depending on your location, app usage and so on. This has been hit or miss for me, so I would advise you to avoid it for the most reliable results. But you can definitely create a manual schedule using the Add Schedule button. Here, You can trigger a Focus mode to automatically start or stop at a certain time of day.\n\nYou can even use Focus Filters to further customize exactly what apps can show you when you’re in a Focus mode. For example, you can choose to only see your work calendar when you’re in your work Focus, but not your other calendars. These filters work for Apple’s apps and even third-party apps.\n\nLastly, you can choose to enable the Intelligent Breakthrough & Silencing feature that's found at the top of the Focus page. If you have an iPhone with Apple Intelligence enabled, you'll see this setting. It uses on-device intelligence to allow priority notifications to interrupt you even when you're in silent mode. This goes over all other customizations that you might've done. But, being an Apple Intelligence feature, its reliability can be a bit iffy. Based on personal experience, I would recommend you take the time to fully customize the Focus mode to your liking instead of handing some of that work over to Apple Intelligence, as it gets things wrong for me fairly often.",

    "fullText": "On Friday, Apple dropped iOS 26.2. Despite being the third update in the iOS 26 era, 26.2 still adds some interesting and useful new features, like alarms for reminders and refinements to the Sleep Score on Apple Watch.\n\nUpdates aren't all about the features, however. Apple typically includes a number of security patches with its software releases as well, which makes each update important to install. You don't always need to install the latest version of iOS or macOS to benefit from these security patches, either: Apple usually releases important security patches for some older versions of its software. iPhones running iOS 18 can install the same security patches as those running iOS 26, as can Mac users running macOS Sequoia or Sonoma, rather than Tahoe.\n\nAll that to say, Apple's update today comes with a series of patches you'll want to install on your iPhone—no matter what software version you're currently running. This particular release ships with 25 patches, and while some of them seem only pertinent to software developers, others are plainly serious.\n\nPerhaps most importantly from a security perspective, this release includes two patches for potential zero-day vulnerabilities. Zero-day flaws are especially dangerous as they are either publicly disclosed or actively exploited before a developer has a chance to issue a patch—leaving users vulnerable to attack.\n\nBoth flaws (CVE-2025-43529 and CVE-2025-14174) affect WebKit, Apple's platform for developing Safari and web browsers on iPhone. Before Apple patched these issues, bad actors could present users with malicious web content. Once the user processes it on their iPhone, it could lead to arbitrary code execution, which, essentially, allows the bad actor to run whatever code they want on your iPhone. Apple says it is aware of reports that these two flaws may have been exploited in \"an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals\" in versions of iOS older than iOS 26.\n\nThis is not the first time Apple has patched flaws with this warning. Due to the iPhone's popularity, these flaws are valuable to governments and other large-scale actors that target high-profile individuals, like journalists and politicians. Apple will even send these users warnings when their iPhone has been identified in such an attack. While the risk is low that the average iPhone user will be targeted in one of these campaigns, it's not impossible, which means it's important to update as soon as a patch is available. These apply to other Apple devices too, like Macs, so update all devices as soon as possible.\n\nWhile those two flaws are the most important of the bunch to fix, there are others here that you'll want to fix ASAP. One of the first to jump out at me was a \"Calling Framework\" flaw that allows bad actors to spoof their FaceTime caller ID. With the rise of AI scams, bad actors could create an AI voice that sounds like someone you know, and spoof their contact so it looks like they're calling you over FaceTime audio. This update patches that possibility—at least, as far as spoofing is concerned.\n\nSpeaking of FaceTime, this update also patches a flaw that sometimes reveals password fields when remotely controlling a device over FaceTime. If you were sharing your screen with someone over a video call, they might be able to see when you typed in your password and use that against you. There's also a patch for an issue that allowed an app to see other apps you had installed on your device—a major privacy and security vulnerability.\n\nIf you use the Photos' app Hidden feature to hide sensitive pictures you don't want others to see, you'll want to install this update ASAP, too: Previous versions of iOS contained a bug that made it possible to view these hidden photos without authentication.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing all of Apple's security patches in this update, the full release notes are as follows:\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: An app may be able to access sensitive payment tokens\n\nDescription: A permissions issue was addressed with additional restrictions.\n\nCVE-2025-46288: floeki, Zhongcheng Li from IES Red Team of ByteDance\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: Processing a file may lead to memory corruption\n\nDescription: The issue was addressed with improved bounds checks.\n\nCVE-2025-43539: Michael Reeves (@IntegralPilot)\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: An attacker may be able to spoof their FaceTime caller ID\n\nDescription: An inconsistent user interface issue was addressed with improved state management.\n\nCVE-2025-46287: an anonymous researcher, Riley Walz\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: Multiple issues in curl\n\nDescription: This is a vulnerability in open source code and Apple Software is among the affected projects.

    "title": "All the New Features in iOS 26.2",
    "description": "Apple's latest update for your iPhone is now available.",
    "fullText": "Apple dropped iOS 26.1 on Nov. 3, introducing some small but meaningful changes to iPhones. But after changing how alarms work, and adding options to adjust the look of Liquid Glass, the company is back at it with another update: iOS 26.2.\n\nAs you might expect, iOS 26.2 isn't a major update. Apple clearly added most of the features and changes it had in mind with iOS 26, and a handful of new features and adjustments with iOS 26.1. Still, iOS 26.2 does bring some changes. Here's what's new:\n\nWith iOS 26.1, Apple added an option to adjust the look of Liquid Glass. With it, you can choose from two options: \"Clear,\" the iconic Liquid Glass look, or \"Tinted,\" which increases opacity of the elements, and turns Liquid Glass into more of a Frosted Glass.\n\nWhile this is a helpful addition for users who didn't like the look of Liquid Glass, some wanted Apple to go a step further, and add a slider to more finely adjust the look of the glassy design. It seems Apple has done just that with iOS 26.2, but not for the system-wide Liquid Glass UI. Instead, with this new version, you get a slider to adjust the look of your Lock Screen clock:\n\nIn addition, it looks like Apple adjusted the Liquid Glass animations throughout iOS. As you can see from the post below, the animation is responsive and bouncy, a bit closer to the demos we saw back in June:\n\nApple is also continuing to update its apps with Liquid Glass. With 26.2, the Measure app is next. The new update adds Liquid Glass bubbles to the app's Level function, which replaces the existing solid white circles.\n\nReminders are an indispensable part of my iPhone. I rely on them on a daily basis to make sure I keep up with important tasks. However, reminder alerts are as present as any other notification on your iPhone. If you frequently watch your notifications, that's just fine, but if you don't check your iPhone so much, or you use Focuses or Do Not Disturb, it can be easy to miss a reminder—and easy to forget to do the thing you were reminding yourself to do.\n\niOS 26.2 has a solution: alarms for reminders. When you set a reminder as \"Urgent\" while running iOS 26.2, you'll see a pop-up asking for permission to to schedule alarms and timers. The idea is, rather than rely on a simple alert, the Reminders app can play an alarm when your reminder is due. I imagine that will help avoid forgotten reminders: You might miss a short ping, but you probably will hear if your iPhone is continuously blaring.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch running watchOS 26, you can take advantage of Apple's new Sleep Score feature. Sleep Score looks at your sleep duration, bedtime, and sleep interruptions to assign you a score to summarize how well you slept. Duration can go up to 50 points, bedtime up to 30, and interruptions up to 20, culminating in a highest possible score of 100.\n\nWith iOS 26.2 and watchOS 26.2, Apple is adjusting the Sleep Score metrics, which should hopefully make it a bit more accurate for users at a glance. Here's how it changed, as noted by MacRumors:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nIn addition, \"Excellent\" is now \"Very High,\" to keep the naming scheme more consistent.\n\niOS 26.2 introduces a new \"Manage Known AirDrop Contacts\" section, that reads: \"You will automatically appear for 30 days to people you have shared a one-time code with.\" As this setting suggests, you may be able to share a one-time code with another user, after which time you will be able to easily find each other over AirDrop for 30 days.\n\nThis new iOS 26.2 feature can update you about \"imminent threats,\" like floods, emergencies, and natural disasters. You'll see maps of affected locations, and links to relevant safety information. This feature is also available on watchOS 26.2.\n\nApple added a new feature to Accessibility Settings that lets you choose to have the device screen flash whenever you receive a notification.\n\nFreeform, Apple's digital whiteboard app, doesn't get the attention it deserves. With iOS 26.2, tables in Freeform can now store text, images, documents, and drawings. Cells also \"intelligently\" resize to fit.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.1, Apple brought back Slide Over. This useful multitasking feature lets you assign one app window that you can easily bring forward or dismiss from the side of the screen. It's great for quick glances at apps like Messages, Music, or social media platforms—things you don't always need on-screen.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.2, Apple is continuing to bring back Slide Over functionality. The company brought back drop and drop, which lets you pick up an app and drop it on top of your active Slide Over window to instantly turn that chosen app to a Slide Over view.\n\nApple is introducing three new changes for the Podcasts app in iOS 26.2. You'll see all three in a pop-up menu the first time you open the app post-update.\n\nFirst, all Podcasts in English will come with chapters by default. Podcasters can include these chapters themselves, or, if none are available, the app will generate them automatically with AI. If podcasters don't want their episodes to have chapters, they can disable the feature on their end. The app will also collect any podcasts mentioned during the show you're listening to in one location, so you can easily find those other podcasts if interested. Similarly, podcasters can roundup any links they want to share in one place, including with timestamped entries in the transcript of the episode. The app may automatically create these links too, based on the contents of the episode.\n\nWhen you update your iPhone to 26.2, you might notice three changes in the Games app. First there are new sorting options, including filters that sort by game size, show what games your friends are playing, and which games support challenges. In addition, the app now has expanded controller compatibility for navigating the app, so you should be able to continue using the controller rather than touch controls when in Games. Finally, your challenge scores will update in real-time as you play games.\n\nFor the last five years, Apple has let you pin your favorite contacts and group chats to the top of the Messages app. With iOS 26, Apple updated CarPlay to support this feature, but didn't give you any say in the matter. If you had pinned chats on your iPhone, CarPlay would mirror that, even if you would prefer to drive without the pinned chats on your car's display.\n\nWith 26.2, however, Apple is giving you the option to disable pinned messages for CarPlay. The option appears as a simple \"Pinned Conversations\" toggle in CarPlay settings.\n\nLive Translation is a promising new feature for AirPods owners running iOS 26. When you're wearing your AirPods, and you start talking to someone who speaks a different language than you do, your iPhone will translate their words on the fly, and you'll hear what they're saying in your target language through your AirPods. Apple isn't the first company to offer this feature and it isn't perfect, but it's great to have it nonetheless.\n\nHowever, EU users running iOS 26 or iOS 26.1 can't use Live Translation. Apple cited the region's Digital Markets Act as the reason it couldn't bring Live Translation to the EU, but the company seems to have sorted out whatever logistical and bureaucratic issues it had been dealing with: Now that iOS 26.2 is here, AirPods users in the EU will be able to use Live Translation, too.\n\nWhile not technically an iOS 26.2 feature, Apple has one major update to macOS with version 26.2: The company has added an \"Edge Light\" feature, which adds a ring of light around your video call window. Apple says the feature uses your Mac's Neural Engine to identify your face and analyze your movements, which allows the light to adjust as needed. If you move your cursor to access something else on your screen, for example, the light will dim so you can see what you're doing. You can also change the light's hue, if you prefer something warmer or cooler for your calls.\n\nWhether this feature will be good enough to replace a dedicated light, like the popular Ring Light, remains to be seen. But this is an interesting and unexpected feature from Apple, and I'm curious to try it for myself when it launches.",

    "title": "Google Maps Will Now Automatically Save Your Parking Spot on iPhone",
    "description": "Wasn't this a thing already?",
    "fullText": "Forgetting where you parked your car isn't just a sitcom trope—though it does make for classic TV. Even in the age of the smartphone, it's all too easy to walk away from your car and retain zero memory of where you left it. As it happens, Google Maps has a solution—provided you have an iPhone.\n\nSo long as you're running the app on an Apple device, Google Maps can automatically remember where you parked and display that information on the map. There's no need to mark the location yourself, tell the app to save your spot, or take a picture of the cross streets in case you forget: You can simply glance at the screen to find a \"You parked here\" label.\n\nThe thing is, while some are reporting this feature is relatively new to them, others suggest it's been out for a while. What gives?\n\nThis feature works if you connect your iPhone to your car, whether via Bluetooth, CarPlay, or a USB cable. When you disconnect your iPhone from your car, Google Maps will assume you've parked, and will automatically mark that location on the map. The feature will also work if you give Google Maps permission to access your Motion & Fitness data, which allows the app to tell when you've started and stopped driving. (You can check on this setting from Google Maps' in-app settings: Head to Navigation, then, under \"Automatically save parking,\" tap Let maps use your motion to save your parking.)\n\nYou can also choose to set Google Maps' location permissions to \"Always,\" which gives the app persistent access to your location data, and also lets it figure out when you've stopped your car. You can change this option on your iPhone by navigating t0 Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Google Maps.\n\nThis feature is genuinely great, and I'm happy Google Maps supports it—even if Android users are inexplicably being excluded for now. But you might also be wondering to yourself, wasn't this already a feature? It doesn't sound all that new. Yet you might have even seen a flurry articles like this one today, all reporting on this \"new\" Google Maps parking feature.\n\nAs it turns out, the answer is a bit complicated. The coverage today all references this announcement on LinkedIn from Google Maps senior product manager Rio Akasaka—only that post is, according to LinkedIn, a month old. Some of the comments are more recent, but others appear to be from the original posting date.\n\nPotentially adding to the confusion, other navigation apps, like Apple Maps, already support automatically saving your parking spot, and while Google Maps has also had an option to save your parking spot for some time, it previously wasn't automatic. If you wanted the app to remember where you stopped, you needed to tap your blue dot on the map and choose \"Save your parking.\" That's how it still is on Android, since the automatic feature only works on iOS.\n\nLooking through the comment sections on articles from outlets like The Verge or MacRumors, some users insist they've had this feature for some time—well before that month-old LinkedIn announcement. This commenter says they've had the feature for years, while this one claims they've had it for \"ages.\" So what gives? Have at least some iPhone users have had this feature for years? It is possible Google has been testing out the feature with smaller subsets of users and only recently rolled it out en masse, but whether or not that actually happened is unclear at this time.\n\nI've reached out to Google for clarification about the timeline of this feature's implementation, and I will update this article if I get an answer. Until then, I can only hope Google is actively working on rolling out the feature to Android, as that really would be something new.",

    "description": "The EU welcomes Apple and Google's plans to enable a more seamless data transfer between iPhone and Android devices.",
    "fullText": "Apple and Google want to simplify data transfer between their iOS and Android platforms, support more data formats, and enable wireless transfer. The EU welcomes this step, stating: The Digital Markets Act is showing its effect.\n\nThe EU Commission has sent a statement to 9to5Mac. In it, a Commission spokesperson says about Apple and Google's cooperation in this area that it is an \"example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) benefits users and developers\".\n\nThe EU further states that this solution allows users to easily transfer data from iPhone to Android and vice versa when setting up a new device. According to the report, the transfer is intended to support \"many types of data\" – including contacts, calendar events, messages, photos, documents, Wi-Fi networks, passwords, and also data from third-party apps. Unlike previous solutions, the optimized method will also be wireless.\n\nAccording to the EU, the more seamless cross-platform data transfer follows the introduction of eSIM transfer by Apple and Google last October. Currently, however, this solution is only supported by a few network operators, but also by some outside the EU.\n\nBoth solutions are the direct result of the DMA, which \"requires effective data portability\" from certain services – including iOS and Android, the EU statement continues. Apple has summarized its work on this project in its DMA compliance reports from March 2024 and March 2025. Furthermore, the solutions are possible through extensive technical work and collaboration between Apple and Google, as well as through intensive discussions with the Commission over the past two years, according to the EU spokesperson.\n\nUnlike numerous features that Apple offers exclusively to its customers in the EU, such as alternative marketplaces, the seamless data transfer between platforms will be provided worldwide. For Apple, the solution is likely to be a win to attract new customers from Google's Android. This could, of course, also happen the other way around, with Google poaching from Apple. For consumers, the new solution means no longer being necessarily trapped in one of the two platform worlds.\n\nIncidentally, Apple will have to open up its iOS and iPadOS even further in the future, so that headphones and smartwatches, for example, work more seamlessly with the operating systems. These requirements are not at all to the company's liking, and it wanted to prevent this. The iPhone maker and Google are also not big fans of the Digital Markets Act: Apple would prefer to abolish the law, Google wishes for a reset, as it causes significant collateral damage in its current form.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "Time to power up.",
    "fullText": "I'm routinely surprised by just how much technology Apple has managed to pack into the iPhone that I can carry in the palm of my hand. What's even more surprising is that underneath the layers, there's even more than what meets the eye. There's a better, faster way to use the keyboard, there's a faster way to select unread emails to archive, there are better ways to browse the web than just the usual Safari experience, and you can get way better photos out of the iPhone Pro cameras than what the stock Camera app shows you.\n\nThe iPhone has become such a default product in all our lives that we just take it for granted. Yes, it's a great way to stay in touch with friends and coworkers, to capture moments, and to doomscroll the night away. But spend some more time, and there's a whole new iPhone experience just waiting for you that will truly transform how your iPhone looks and works.\n\nApple installs the Shortcuts app on every device and even offers pre-built shortcut automations that you can install from the Gallery. But the fun starts when you explore the very active Shortcuts community online and start to integrate Automations into the mix.\n\nApple’s Shortcuts app lets you create automations that automatically follow pre-defined steps. They can be used to resize images, compress files, convert data, and even control aspects of your smartphone. For example, you can create an automation that automatically enables a VPN when you step out of your home, or sends a message to your partner when you leave work. Looking to get started? We have a list of seven automations that I feel every iPhone user should install.\n\nI’m a huge fan of custom widgets. Whenever someone picks up my iPhone, the response is usually something like, \"Your iPhone doesn’t look like a regular iPhone.\" That’s down to custom widgets that show the time, day, my appointments, the weather, my tasks, and more. The world of custom iPhone widgets is huge, and if you just want to dip your toes in, I would suggest you start with the Widgetsmith app, which lets you customize multiple widgets with the same theme and fonts. All together, it looks really aesthetically pleasing. When you’re ready, you can dive in with the Widgy app, where you can import and customize thousands of interactive widgets.\n\nThe iPhone has a hidden button, and it’s on the back of your iPhone. It’s an accessibility feature that you can access via Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap. You can then assign any app, shortcut, or action to either the Double Tap or Triple Tap gesture. It’s a great way to trigger Shortcuts automations, or to simply bring up the selfie camera. I personally find that the double-tap gesture has a tendency to misfire sometimes, and the triple-tap gesture is a lot more reliable.\n\nIf you don’t use Safari extensions, you’re sleeping on unrealized potential. Just like on the Mac, the Safari browser on the iPhone also supports extensions. And you can use extensions to do some really cool things, like blocking all ads and trackers (of course), but also to force every website to be in dark mode, all the time. You’ll also find extensions to improve the Reddit browsing experience and to take complete control of all the elements on the websites you use frequently.\n\nUsing a third-party browser, like Vivaldi, is a very power-user move. All third-party browsers on iOS are technically variations of Safari, as Apple forces developers to build their browsers on Safari's WebKit platform. However, these third-party browsers can include unique features that Safari doesn't. Vivaldi, for example, offers desktop-class tab browsing, including tab groups and pinned tabs. Then there’s Orion, which can run desktop-class extensions from Firefox and Chrome Web Store on your iPhone (something that Safari can’t do). And if you don’t like Safari’s new interface, try out Quiche, which is a completely customizable browser.\n\nFocuses have the potential to transform how your iPhone looks and works, based on your location, time, day, or the task at hand. It’s time to go beyond Do Not Disturb and embrace everything that Apple's Focuses can do.\n\nIt would be a good idea for you to set up Focuses for Work, Personal Time, and Sleep. In each Focus, you can decide which apps can send notifications, and which friends or family members can contact you. You can even choose which home screens to show in particular Focus, choosing to hide widgets and apps depending on the Focus (no work stuff at all in Personal Time Focus, for example). Focus also integrates with Shortcuts and Automations, so you can trigger a Focus when you start a video call on your Mac or reach a particular location (like your workplace). Go to Settings > Focus to get started.\n\nYou’ll be familiar with all the usual iPhone gestures, like swiping up from the Home bar, or tapping the top edge of the iPhone to instantly scroll to the top. But the iPhone has a lot more hidden gestures that can really speed things up. If you see a long list, try to swipe down with two fingers to instantly start selecting items. This works really well in Mail, Phone, and other Apple apps, but is also supported by third-party apps. Next, in iOS 26, Apple added back gesture support that’s arguably better than Android. You can swipe in from anywhere on the left edge to quickly go back.\n\nYou can also cut, copy, and paste with a three-finger gesture. To copy something, pinch it with three fingers. To cut, do it twice. To paste something, do a three-finger spread gesture (opposite of the pinch).\n\nThe iPhone keyboard is more than what meets the eye. It has a built-in Slide to Type feature where you can glide your finger over the keys to type words. It works really well, especially when using the phone one-handed. There’s a virtual trackpad built in, too. Just tap and hold the Space bar and move your finger to move the cursor around.\n\nIf you find your keyboard too large to type on, you can also enable the one-handed keyboard from the Keyboard Settings button (tap and hold the Globe icon). From here, you can go to Keyboard Settings to enable a multi-lingual keyboard and to try out Text Replacement, where you can create shortcuts for expanding your frequently used text snippets. For example, you can type “adrs” to expand to your full home address.\n\nYou might not know this, but there’s a really neat document scanner built into the Notes app and the Files app. I prefer to use the Files app for this because I get to save a PDF directly in the folder that I want. Open the Files app, go to any folder, tap the three-dotted Menu icon, and choose the Scan Documents feature. There’s an Auto Shutter feature that’s enabled by default that will automatically scan each new page you put in front of your camera (if you find this annoying, you can disable it as well). Scan as many pages as you want, and tap the Done button. Then, give the document a name. And it’s now stored as a PDF in the folder. You can now send it to where it needs to go, or back it up using iCloud Drive.\n\nThe cameras on the iPhone Pro are truly stellar. But the Camera app is not. The default Camera app does too much computational photography for my taste, and has trouble focusing on elements exactly when I need to capture something small. Plus, the Pro cameras can shoot in Log in ProRes, and to fully take control of the visuals from your iPhone, you’ll need to step out of the Camera app.\n\nFor shooting video in the best light, Blackmagic is a great choice. Here, you get full manual control over both photos and videos, with film-grade presets (including the ability to create your own custom ones).\n\nIf that feels a bit too Pro, try using a third-party app to capture much better photos. My colleague Pranay has highlighted a couple of great options, with Halide Mark II topping the list (I agree, as well). Halide gives you a lot more control over the look of your photos. There’s also a Process Zero feature that removes all of Apple’s computational processes from the photos.",

    "description": "For reminders you really shouldn't forget.",
    "fullText": "Apple’s various apps and utilities are finally starting to talk to each other, and it’s great news for iPhone users. Last year, Apple added the ability to sync Reminders with Calendar, which added time-based reminders directly into your Calendar view—a feature I now regularly use. Now, with iOS 26.2, Apple is finally integrating Reminders with the Alarms app; you'll be able to set an accompanying alarm for any reminder.\n\nIf, like me, you tend to be forgetful—if you need a reminder for your reminder—this will be a handy feature. The alarm will sound, taking up your entire screen until you dismiss it. And yes, you can snooze it.\n\nTo get started, open the Reminder app, navigate to a task list, and either create a new reminder, or edit it. When you’re adding a date and time, you’ll see a new Urgent toggle. When you enable the Urgent mode, it will turn on an alarm that will go off when the reminder is due. The alarm will trigger even when your iPhone is in silent mode or in a Do Not Disturb Focus mode, so be careful when setting it up.\n\nWhen you enable this for the first time, you’ll get a connection request for integrating Reminders with Alarms. Here, tap Allow. If you don’t see this popup, or if you’ve dismissed it before, go to Settings > Apps > Reminders, and in the \"Allow Reminders to Access\" section, enable the Alarms toggle.\n\nWhen the reminder is due, you’ll see a full-screen reminder interface, with the reminder up top, and an option to slide to stop (using Apple’s new sliding interface for dismissing alarms, which you can disable if you want). You’ll also see a big blue Snooze button. This will snooze the reminder for nine minutes.\n\nWhether you hit the Snooze button or you use the slider to stop the alarm, Apple will add the Reminder to the top of the notifications list, as a Live Activity. You’ll see the reminder, with the snooze duration (if enabled), and the task. To actually complete the task, you’ll have to check it off from the Live Activity or the Reminders app.\n\nUnlike in the new alarm feature, there’s no way to edit the Snooze duration for reminders, or to disable the slider. If you don’t like the Snooze feature or the two-tap approach to completing reminders, you can switch it out for a Complete button instead. Go to Settings > Apps > Reminders and in the \"Urgent Reminders\" section, enable the Complete from Alarm feature. Now, when the alarm goes off, you’ll see two buttons instead: Slide to Stop and Complete. When you tap Complete, the alarm will disappear, and the task will be marked as Complete.",

    "title": "Apple and Google Are Making It Easier to Switch Between iPhone and Android",
    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",
