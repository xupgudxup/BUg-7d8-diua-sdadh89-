    "description": "I was convinced AI was ruining human connection. Then my husband used it to write the most heartfelt anniversary card I've ever received.",
    "fullText": "As a geriatric millennial and a licensed psychologist, I often lament technological changes that I see as threatening to human interactions, such as AI.\n\nEven though I try to find the gray in all areas of life, I've been rather black-and-white about AI because I worry it's diminishing our ability to relate to one another.\n\nHowever, a recent experience with my husband has made me more curious about AI.\n\nWe recently celebrated our ninth wedding anniversary, and unbeknownst to me at the time, my husband used GenAI to write my card. He was traveling at the time, so he sent flowers and chocolate, with a card attached. The flowers were severely underwhelming, and I'm not just being a brat. My husband even called the company upon returning to express his frustration with how different they appeared in person.\n\nBut when I read the note accompanying the tiny arrangement, I teared up right away. It was heartwarming, meaningful, and really on the nose.\n\nMy husband's lack of romantic effusiveness has historically been frustrating to me. He has made steady progress in this area, and even ending cards with \"love\" more frequently marks such improvement. So, this note felt in line with his desire to share more emotionality, and I was touched that he'd taken that step just because he knew it would make me happy.\n\nMy husband knows about my big feelings about AI, and he shares many of them. It seems like everyone relies on ChatGPT for relationship advice, and the most common use of META AI right now is to ask for guidance about difficult conversations with loved ones or bosses. I see it in my therapy practice all the time, and I'm skeptical about how sound the AI advice my clients receive actually is.\n\nSo, when I, a historically staunch critic of all things AI, found out that my husband had used ChatGPT to create our anniversary card, I admit I had some strong feelings.\n\nAs lacking in the sentimental department as my husband can be, I am at the opposite end of the spectrum — a hopeless romantic, as they say. I save just about every card I get, tucked into a neat little box. When I reread my husband's card before putting it away, I found myself lingering on some of the words. \"…life we built together\" especially sat with me. It's a common phrase, but it's not in my husband's emotional lexicon. It almost sounded like somebody else's voice. And given that we can't go more than a few days without reading about how AI will ruin people's ability to think for themselves, I had that thought. \"Did AI write one of the sweetest parts of my anniversary card?\"\n\nI was delicate. I reiterated how much I'd enjoyed our belated anniversary celebration before I asked: \"Did you use AI to write our anniversary card?\" He copped to it, grinning from ear to ear.\n\nShockingly to me, I wasn't mad. This discovery actually opened a door for us to talk about how useful it is to get a little help writing a card. The pre-printed messages often feel overly mushy, and the \"blank inside\" cards ask us to get vulnerable in expressing our emotions. For many, including my husband, that's incredibly difficult. The result is often a message that neither the giver nor the receiver feels particularly happy about.\n\nBut this year's note was perfectly balanced. The right amount of gush without the melodrama. I felt seen, and I felt it captured our relationship well.\n\nIf AI can help people express their love for one another, that can't be a bad thing, right? Besides, is asking ChatGPT for help any less authentic than using a pre-printed Hallmark message? ChatGPT provided more accurate information about our relationship than a Hallmark writer ever could, and it offered guidance for a note that made me feel loved and appreciated.\n\nWhile the idea of a world in which chatbots replace our friends and therapists is still deeply concerning to me, this recent experience has helped me find the gray in my previously black-and-white view: I don't know that I'll ever come around to AI replacing human connection, but I do see the utility now in using AI to help us enhance our existing human connections.\n\nAt the very least, I look forward to more anniversaries with really accurate love notes.",

OpenAI included screenshots of these kinds of videos in its press release, indicating how the two companies expect people to use the app’s new cast. Sora already allows users to generate videos that include their own likenesses.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, said the licensing deal would place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”.\n\nThey may even offer a chance at wide viewership, with some fan-made videos being displayed on the Disney+ streaming service, a move seemingly designed to compete with TikTok’s and YouTube Shorts’ infinite feeds, which themselves often include clips of popular TV shows and movies.",

    "title": "How OpenAI's Latest Model Will Impact ChatGPT",
    "description": "GPT-5.2 is here, and, according to OpenAI, better than ever.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is having a hell of a day. First, the company announced a $1 billion equity investment from Disney, alongside a licensing deal that will let Sora users generate videos with characters like Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker, and Simba. Shortly after, OpenAI revealed its latest large language model: GPT-5.2.\n\nOpenAI says that this new GPT model is particularly useful for \"professional knowledge work.\" The company advertises how GPT-5.2 is better than previous models at making spreadsheets, putting together presentations, writing code, analyzing pictures, and working through multi-step projects. For this model, the company also gathered insights from tech companies: Supposedly, Notion, Box Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom all find GPT-5.2 to have \"state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning,\" while Databricks, Hex, and Triple Whale believe GPT-5.2 to be \"exceptional\" with both agentic data science and document analysis tasks.\n\nBut most of OpenAI's user base aren't professionals. Most of the users who will interact with GPT-5.2 are using ChatGPT, and many of those for free, at that. What can those users expect when OpenAI upgrades the free version of ChatGPT with these new models?\n\nOpenAI says that GPT-5.2 will improve ChatGPT's \"day to day\" functionality. The new model supposedly makes the chatbot more structured, reliable, and \"enjoyable to talk to,\" though I've never found the last part to be necessarily true.\n\nGPT-5.2 will impact the ChatGPT experience differently depending on which of the three models you happen to be using. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Instant is for \"everyday work and learning.\" It's apparently better for questions seeking information about certain subjects, how-to questions and walkthroughs, technical writing, and translations—maybe ChatGPT will get you to give up your Duolingo obsession.\n\nGPT-5.2 Thinking, however, is supposedly made for \"deeper work.\" OpenAI wants you using this model for coding, summarizing lengthy documents, answering queries about files you send to ChatGPT, solving math and logic problems, and decision making. Finally, there's GPT-5.2 Pro, OpenAI's \"smartest and most trustworthy option\" for the most complicated questions. The company says 5.2 Pro produces fewer errors and stronger performance compared to previous models.\n\nOpenAI says that this latest update improves how the models responds to distressing prompts, such as those showing signs of suicide, self-harm, or emotional dependence on the AI. As such, the company says this model has \"fewer undesirable responses\" in GPT-5.2 Instant and Thinking compared to GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking. In addition, the company is working on an \"age prediction model,\" which will automatically place content restrictions on users who the model think are under 18.\n\nThese safety improvements are important—critical, even—as we start to understand the correlations between chatbots and mental health. The company has admitted its failure in \"recognizing signs of delusion,\" as users turned to the tool for emotional support. In some cases, ChatGPT fed into delusional thinking, encouraging people's dangerous beliefs. Some families have even sued companies like OpenAI over claims that their chatbots helped or encouraged victims commit suicide.\n\nActively acknowledging improvements to user safety is undoubtedly a good thing, but I think companies like OpenAI still have a lot to reckon with—and a long way to go.\n\nOpenAI says GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro will all roll out today, Thursday, Dec. 11, to paid plans. Developers can access the new models in the API today, as well.\n\nDisclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "description": "Darth Vader and other Disney characters are coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app as part of a three-year licensing deal.",
    "fullText": "Darth Vader is coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app.\n\nThe House of Mouse and OpenAI struck a three-year licensing agreement on Thursday to make Disney \"the first major content licensing partner on Sora.\"\n\nIt's also investing $1 billion into the AI pioneer and receiving warrants to purchase additional equity.\n\nShares of Disney climbed over 2% after the opening bell.\n\n\"As part of this new, three-year licensing agreement, Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that can be viewed and shared by fans, drawing from a set of more than 200 animated, masked and creature characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, including costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments,\" OpenAI said in a Thursday announcement.\n\nIn addition to striking a licensing deal, Disney is also becoming a \"major customer\" of the AI company, according to the announcement, and buying ChatGPT enterprise licenses for its employees.\n\nWhile Sora, OpenAI's TikTok-like AI video app, has been generating buzz and downloads since its launch earlier this year, users of the company's more popular product, ChatGPT, will also have access to AI versions of Disney's characters as part of the deal.\n\nThe AI-generated Disney characters will be available starting in early 2026.\n\nThe move is likely to prove controversial in Hollywood, where many actors have publicly voiced concern about AI use and concerns over how their likeness is used. Disney and OpenAI stated that \"the agreement does not include any talent likenesses or voices.\"\n\nCreators are core to Disney, and its CEO Bob Iger stressed that the deal represented no threat to creators.\n\n\"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday.\n\n\"The other thing it does is it enables us to be comfortable that Open AI is putting guardrails essentially around how these are used, so that really there's nothing for us to be concerned about from a consumer perspective, meaning this will be a safe environment and a safe way for consumers to engage with our founders in a new way,\" he added.\n\nIger hinted at such a transaction during the company's most recent earnings call, making extensive comments about the potential he sees for AI to enhance Disney's direct-to-consumer strategy. He said the company was having extensive talks with AI companies to protect its IP as well as generate more engagement with users.\n\nHis comments demonstrate how Disney — like other Hollywood players — is looking for new ways for people to interact with its platforms and brands as user-generated content platforms and independent creators gain popularity.\n\nDisney, like those other players, has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content, while YouTube has grown. The bet with AI is that it can get people to spend more time on its platforms by giving them more ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nThe companies hinted as much in the announcement, saying that they would \"collaborate to utilize OpenAI's models to power new experiences for Disney + subscribers.\"\n\nDisney is also wary of the tech's risk to its IP. In June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. The suit is ongoing.\n\nDisney's $1 billion cash infusion comes at a critical time for OpenAI, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $1.4 trillion the AI company has pledged to spend over the next eight years on data centers.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously said that large rights holders would ultimately welcome their content being used on Sora, provided it was done with proper guardrails in place. His comments came after OpenAI stepped up restrictions on the Sora app in the wake of viral user-generated videos depicting SpongeBob as Walter White and Pikachu in \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\n\n\"Most of the rights holders that I've spoken to are actually extremely excited to get their content in here,\" Altman told tech analyst Ben Thompson in October. \"They just want to be able to set more restrictions than they would need for images because videos feel different.\"",

    "description": "You can now get Adobe's AI image editor inside OpenAI's AI chatbot.",
    "fullText": "Generative AI tools continue to improve in terms of their photo editing capabilities, and OpenAI's latest upgrade brings Adobe Photoshop right inside your ChatGPT app window (alongside Adobe Acrobat for handling PDFs, and Adobe Express for graphic design). It's available to everyone, for free—you just need a ChatGPT account and an Adobe account.\n\nAs per Adobe, the idea is to make \"creativity accessible for everyone\" by plugging Photoshop tools directly into ChatGPT. The desktop version of Photoshop already comes with plenty of generative AI features of its own, so this is AI layered on top of more AI—but is it actually useful?\n\nAdobe Photoshop, Adobe Express and Adobe Acrobat are available now inside ChatGPT on the desktop, on the web, and on iOS. At the time of writing, you can also get Adobe Express inside ChatGPT for Android, with Photoshop and Acrobat \"coming soon.\" To weigh the capabilities of the new integration, I tested it in a desktop web browser.\n\nTo get started, all you need to do is type \"Photoshop\" at the start of your prompt: ChatGPT should recognize what you're trying to do, and select Adobe Photoshop as the tool to use for the next prompt. You'll also need to click through a couple of confirmation dialog boxes, and connect an Adobe account (if you don't have one, you can make one for free).\n\nWith all the connections and logins completed, Photoshop is then added to the overflow menu in the prompt box, so just click on the + (plus) to select it. You can start describing what you want to happen using the same natural, conversational language you'd use for any other ChatGPT prompt. You do need to also upload an image or provide a public link to one—if you don't do this before you submit your prompt, you'll be asked to do it after.\n\nYou don't need to know the names of all the Photoshop tools: Just describe what you want to happen and the relevant tools will be selected for you. One example Adobe gives is using the prompt \"make my image pop,\" which brings up the Bloom, Grain, and Lens Distortion effects—and each one can be adjusted via sliders on screen. It's actually quite simple to use.\n\nIf you do know the name of the tools you want, you can call them up by name, and the classic brightness and contrast sliders are a good place to start. You can either say something like \"make the picture brighter\" or \"adjust the image brightness\"—both will bring up an overlay you can use to make brightness adjustments, but if you use the former prompt, the image will already have been made a little brighter.\n\nChatGPT and Photoshop let you add edit upon edit as needed, and you can save the image at any stage. There's also the option to open your processed file in the Photoshop web app whenever you like: This web app uses a freemium model, with advanced features requiring a subscription, and seems to be what the ChatGPT integration is largely based on.\n\nAdobe offers a handy ChatGPT prompts cheat sheet you can browse through, which gives you a good idea of what's possible, and what you're still going to need Photoshop proper for. Note that you can specify certain parts of the image to focus on (like \"the face\" or \"the car\") but this depends on Photoshop-in-ChatGPT being able to correctly figure out where you want your selection to be. It needs to be pretty obvious and well delineated.\n\nWhen I tried cutting out objects and removing backgrounds, this worked well—but then I had to turn to Photoshop on the web to actually drop in a different background. There's no way to work with layers or masks here, and you can't remove people or objects from photos, either. Sometimes, however, you do get a spool of \"thinking\" from ChatGPT about how it can't do what the user is asking for.\n\nI was able to apply some nice colorizations here, via prompts like \"turn all the hues in this image to blue,\" and I like the way ChatGPT will give you further instructions on how to get the effect you want. You can even say \"show some examples\" and it gives you a few presets to choose from—all of which can be adjusted via the sliders again.\n\nThe ability to run prompts like \"turn this into an oil painting\" or \"turn this into a cartoon\" are useful too, though the plug-in is limited by the effects available in Photoshop for the web: You'll be directed to the closest effect and advised how to tweak it to get the look you want.\n\nActually, some of these effects work better in ChatGPT's native image editor, which maybe explains why Adobe wanted to get involved here.\n\nIf ChatGPT's image manipulation gets good enough, then Photoshop is no longer going to be needed by a substantial number of users: ChatGPT can already remove people and objects from photos, for example, quite effectively. What it's not quite as good at is some of the basic adjustments (like colors and contrast) that Adobe software has been managing for years.\n\nFor quick, basic edits you want to type out in natural language—especially where you want to adjust the edits manually and need advice on what to do next—Photoshop inside ChatGPT is a handy tool to be able to turn to, especially as it's free. For serious edits, though, you're still going to want to fire up the main Photoshop app, or maybe even shun Adobe altogether and make use of ChatGPT's steadily improving editing tools.",

    "description": "OpenAI is in a far less commanding position than it was following the public release of ChatGPT a few short years ago.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is in a far less commanding position than it was following the public release of ChatGPT a few short years ago.\n\nBack in 2022, the sudden popularity of ChatGPT sent Google into a panic. The company was so worried about the possibility of the upstart chatbot disrupting its Search business, executives sounded a \"code red\" alert inside of the company and called Sergey Brin and Larry Page out of retirement to help it formulate a response to OpenAI. It then rushed out Bard, announcing its first commercial chatbot on February 6, 2023. Google's stock tanked days later when the AI incorrectly answered a question about NASA's James Webb Space Telescope during a public demo.\n\nBut it wasn't just Google that wanted a piece of OpenAI, while the search giant sought to compete with it, others — including Microsoft and Apple — made deals with the company to bring its technology to their products and services, all the promise that AI would eventually revolutionize every facet of the economy.\n\nSince then, OpenAI has seen its lead against Google and much of the AI industry evaporate, culminating in a series of successive blows throughout 2025. On January 20, the same day Altman was busy rubbing shoulders with other tech oligarchs at Donald Trump’s inauguration, China’s DeepSeek quietly released its R1 chain-of-thought model. A week later, the startup's chatbot surpassed ChatGPT as the most-download free app on the US App Store. The overnight success of DeepSeek eliminated $1 trillion worth of stock market value, and almost certainly left OpenAI blindsided.\n\nIn response, the company showed a newfound urgency. In one week, for instance, OpenAI released both o3-mini and Deep Research. It even went so far as to announce the latter on a Sunday evening. But for all its new urgency, OpenAI's biggest, most important release of the year was a miss.\n\nIt's safe to say GPT-5 hasn't lived up to anyone's expectations, including OpenAI's own. The company touted the system as smarter, faster and better than all of its previous models, but after users got their hands on it, they complained of a chatbot that made surprisingly dumb mistakes and didn't have much of a personality. For many, GPT-5 felt like a downgrade compared to the older, simpler GPT-4o. That's a position no AI company wants to be in, let alone one that has taken on as much investment as OpenAI.\n\nAnthropic was quick to take advantage of the weakness, signing a deal with Microsoft to bring its Claude models to Copilot 365. Previously, Microsoft depended exclusively on OpenAI for partner models in Copilot. Before the company announced the integration, reporting from The Informationsaid Microsoft made the decision based on the strength of Anthropic's Sonnet 4.0 model, judging it \"perform[ed] better in subtle but important ways\" relative to OpenAI's offerings.\n\nHowever, what will likely go down as the defining moment occurred a few short weeks after OpenAI announced the conclusion of its restructuring. On November 18, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, and immediately the new model leap-frogged the competition, including GPT-5. As of the writing of this article, Google's new model is at the top of LMArena, the site where humans compare outputs from different AI systems and vote on the best one. GPT-5, by contrast, is currently ranked sixth overall, behind models from Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nAccording to a December 2 report from TheWall Street Journal, Sam Altman sent a companywide memo following the release of Gemini 3 Pro. Echoing the words Google used to describe the situation it found itself against OpenAI in 2023, he called for a \"code red\" effort to improve ChatGPT. Altman reportedly told employees there would be temporary reassignments and that the company would delay some products, all in an effort to catch up to Google and Anthropic.\n\nThe few numbers these companies are willing to share don't paint a promising picture for OpenAI. Each month, about 800 million people use ChatGPT. On paper, that's impressive, but Google is catching up there too. In October, the company said the Gemini app had 650 million users, up from 450 million just a few months earlier in July, thanks to the popularity of its Nano Banana Pro image generator.\n\nMore importantly, OpenAI has an inherent disadvantage against Google. For the search giant, AI may touch everything the company does now, but Gemini is just one product in an extensive portfolio that includes many other popular services. Google can fund its AI advancements with money it makes elsewhere. OpenAI cannot say the same. The company is constantly raising money to stay afloat, and according to a financial roadmap obtained by The Journal, it will need its revenue to grow to about $200 billion annually to become profitable by 2030. In November, Altman said on X the company was on track to hit above $20 billion in annualized revenue this year.\n\nIn an effort to grow revenue, Altman and company have adopted an incredibly risky strategy. In recent months, OpenAI has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition that is already beating it. Many of those agreements can only be described as circular, and I think the fears about a financial bubble are real. In the first half of 2025, investment in data centers accounted for nearly all of US GDP growth. Even if there's not a repeat of the 2008 housing market crisis or the dot-com crash, the AI boom is at the very least poised to make everyday electronics (and utilities) more expensive for regular people in the short term.\n\nSince late October, demand for server-grade computer components, including memory and storage, has sent the price of consumer PC parts skyrocketing as manufacturers devote more of their production capacity and wafers to high-margin customers like OpenAI and Google. Since late October, the cost of most RAM kits has doubled and tripled. In November, the price of some SSDs went up by as much as 60 percent. Next year, the cost of LPDDR5X memory, which is used in both smartphones and NVIDIA servers, is expected to climb as well.\n\n\"Be it carmakers, smartphones or consumer electronics, everyone that uses memory is facing pressure from price hikes and supply constraints in the coming year,\" Zhao Haijun, the co-CEO of memory manufacturer SMIC told analysts, per Bloomberg.\n\nGita Gopinath, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, recently estimated that if the AI bubble were to burst, it would wipe out $20 trillion in wealth held by American households. The Great Recession, considered the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression, reduced US household net worth by $11.5 trillion, and it took years before for American families to rebuild their wealth to pre-recession levels.\n\nThe modern AI bubble may have been started by ChatGPT, but given the crowded field of chatbots and LLMs, it won't necessarily pop should OpenAI go bust. With novelty and technical prowess no longer on its side though, it's now on Altman to prove in short order why his company still deserves such unprecedented levels of investment.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says his most famous product has helped him manage life as an actual parent.\n\n\"I cannot imagine having gone through, figuring out how to raise a newborn without ChatGPT,\" Altman told Jimmy Fallon during an interview on NBC's flagship late-night talk show. \"Clearly, people did it for a long time — no problem.\"\n\nAltman said he feels \"kind of bad\" asking a technology that boasts such wide-knowledge questions like, \"Why does my kid stop dropping pizza on the floor and laughing?\"\n\nAnother example, Altman said, was a couple of months ago when he was at a party talking to someone who was also raising a newborn. Altman recalled that the parents said their six-month-old was \"crawling everywhere.\" Altman said he grew concerned that his son was not at the same stage.\n\n\"I ran to the bathroom, and I was like, do I need to take my kid to the doctor tomorrow morning?\" Altman said, describing what he typed into ChatGPT: \"Is this okay?\"\n\nAltman said OpenAI's chatbot responded \"with a great answer, which was of course,\" his son's development was \"normal.\"\n\n\"It is personalized, like ChatGPT gets to know you, and by the way, you're the CEO of OpenAI, you probably are around all these high-achieving people, maybe you don't want to project that onto your kid, and you should just relax, and he'll be fine, whatever,\" Altman told Fallon of the answer.\n\nFallon didn't touch on OpenAI's recent struggles. Last week, Altman reportedly declared a \"code red\" in a private message to employees, ordering a greater focus on ChatGPT as competitors like Google make significant advancements with their competing AI models.\n\nInstead, Altman's late-night debut featured the lighthearted fare that's standard on late-night TV. At one point, Fallon asked Altman to explain what ChatGPT is in case viewers who were unaware, including the host's dad, might be watching.\n\nAltman has spoken in the past about how becoming a parent has added another lens to his outlook on AI.\n\n\"My kid is never going to grow up being smarter than AI,\" Altman said during a January episode of the \"Re:Thinking\" podcast with Adam Grant. \"Children in the future will only know a world with AI in it.\"\n\nThe OpenAI CEO and his husband, Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their son in February with an announcement on X. Despite Altman's stature, the couple has led a relatively private life.\n\nFallon, who has two daughters, also joked with Altman about when their kids reached certain developmental milestones, like crawling.\n\n\"Mine was on Dancing with the Stars at seven months,\" Fallon said. \"Semi-finalist.\"",

    "fullText": "Experts warn of dangers as England and Wales study shows 13- to 17-year-olds consulting AI amid long waiting lists for services\n\nIt was after one friend was shot and another stabbed, both fatally, that Shan asked ChatGPT for help. She had tried conventional mental health services but “chat”, as she came to know her AI “friend”, felt safer, less intimidating and, crucially, more available when it came to handling the trauma from the deaths of her young friends.\n\nAs she started consulting the AI model, the Tottenham teenager joined about 40% of 13- to 17-year-olds in England and Wales affected by youth violence who are turning to AI chatbots for mental health support, according to research among more than 11,000 young people.\n\nIt found that both victims and perpetrators of violence were markedly more likely to be using AI for such support than other teenagers. The findings, from the Youth Endowment Fund, have sparked warnings from youth leaders that children at risk “need a human not a bot”.\n\nThe results suggest chatbots are fulfilling demand unmet by conventional mental health services, which have long waiting lists and which some young users find lacking in empathy. The supposed privacy of the chatbot is another key factor in driving use by victims or perpetrators of crimes.\n\nAfter her friends were killed Shan, 18, not her real name, started using Snapchat’s AI before switching to ChatGPT, which she can talk to at any time of day or night with two clicks on her smartphone.\n\n“I feel like it definitely is a friend,” she said, adding that it was less intimidating, more private and less judgmental than her experience with conventional NHS and charity mental health support.\n\n“The more you talk to it like a friend it will be talking to you like a friend back. If I say to chat ‘Hey bestie, I need some advice’. Chat will talk back to me like it’s my best friend, she’ll say, ‘Hey bestie, I got you girl’.”\n\nOne in four of 13- to 17-year-olds have used an AI chatbot for mental health support in the past year, with black children twice as likely as white children to have done so, the study found. Teenagers were more likely to go online for support, including using AI, if they were on a waiting list for treatment or diagnosis or had been denied, than if they were already receiving in-person support.\n\nCrucially, Shan said, the AI was “accessible 24/7” and would not tell teachers or parents about what she had disclosed. She felt this was a considerable advantage over telling a school therapist, after her own experience of what she thought were confidences being shared with teachers and her mother.\n\nBoys who were involved in gang activities felt safer asking chatbots for advice about other safer ways to make money than a teacher or parent who might leak the information to police or other gang members, putting them in danger, she said.\n\nAnother young person, who has been using AI for mental health support but asked not to be named, told the Guardian: “The current system is so broken for offering help for young people. Chatbots provide immediate answers. If you’re going to be on the waiting list for one to two years to get anything, or you can have an immediate answer within a few minutes … that’s where the desire to use AI comes from.”\n\nJon Yates, the chief executive of the Youth Endowment Fund, which commissioned the research, said: “Too many young people are struggling with their mental health and can’t get the support they need. It’s no surprise that some are turning to technology for help. We have to do better for our children, especially those most at risk. They need a human not a bot.”\n\nThere have been growing concerns about the dangers of chatbots when children engage with them at length. OpenAI, the US company behind ChatGPT, is facing several lawsuits including from families of young people who have killed themselves after long engagements.\n\nIn the case of the Californian 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his life in April, OpenAI has denied it was caused by the chatbot. It has said it has been improving its technology “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.”. The startup said in September it could start contacting authorities in cases where users start talking seriously about suicide.\n\nHanna Jones, a youth violence and mental health researcher in London, said: “To have this tool that could tell you technically anything – it’s almost like a fairytale. You’ve got this magic book that can solve all your problems. That sounds incredible.”\n\nBut she is worried about the lack of regulation.\n\n“People are using ChatGPT for mental health support, when it’s not designed for that,” she said. “What we need now is to increase regulations that are evidence-backed but also youth-led. This is not going to be solved by adults making decisions for young people. Young people need to be in the driving seat to make decisions around ChatGPT and mental health support that uses AI, because it’s so different to our world. We didn’t grow up with this. We can’t even imagine what it is to be a young person today.”",
