    "fullText": "After a frustrating draw with NYCFC that felt more like a loss Sunday, the LA Galaxy are back in action at Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday night. This time, for the second leg of their Concacaf Champions Cup opening round against Sporting San Miguelito.\n\nAfter the first leg, LA hold the advantage, last week's 1-1 draw in Panama means a win, or any scoreless draw, sends the Galaxy through to the round of 16, where Jamaican club Mt. Pleasant, the 2025 Caribbean Cup champion, awaits.\n\nIn Concacaf Champions Cup play, the away goals rule acts as the primary tiebreaker for two-legged knockout rounds (Round One through Semifinals). If the aggregate score is tied after two legs, the team with more away goals advances. If away goals are also equal, the tie goes directly to penalties.\n\nBut as head coach Greg Vanney made clear, the away goal conceded in the first leg makes this a precarious lead.\n\n“I think it's really up to them. It's a catch-22,” Vanney said of San Miguelito’s approach. “Ninety minutes is a long time, so I don't think you necessarily have to come out flying... It's really up to us to have the solution to whichever way they come.”\n\nFor a Galaxy side still trying to find its rhythm, that unpredictability is the central challenge. The team returned from Panama and looked sharp early against NYCFC, with new striker João Klauss scoring inside two minutes. But as Vanney noted, that sharpness faded.\n\nYour @LARiotSquad Player of the Match, João Klauss ⭐️ pic.twitter.com/2uKGPBkqbA\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 24, 2026\n\n“We haven't had two back-to-back training sessions in a row since somewhere in Coachella,” Vanney explained. “We're actually trying to evolve a little bit inside of these games and solve some different looks.”\n\nThe \"look\" in Panama was a disciplined, bunkered approach from San Miguelito that the Galaxy couldn't fully break down, surrendering a goal that gave the visitors a precious away tally.\n\nThe \"look\" against NYCFC was a high press that the Galaxy solved early, only to stall after going down to ten men following a lengthy VAR review. The result was another draw, leaving the Galaxy with more questions than answers.\n\nNext up: @TheChampions at home on wednesday ⏭️ pic.twitter.com/aUmWrPJrLN\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 23, 2026\n\n“We got off to a great start, and we just didn't deal with the ball well. I thought we defended really well for large stretches,” Vanney reflected on the NYCFC match. “We're evolving, and tomorrow is another opportunity to take a step.”\n\nThat step will require the Galaxy to dictate the tempo against a San Miguelito team that now has a clear objective: find a goal and hunker down defensively.\n\nVanney believes these dense, high-stakes fixtures are the perfect classroom for his squad.\n\n“What's beautiful about these moments is the team is facing different challenges,” he said. “Playing against a low block in Panama, your team has to change its mentality because they have to add speed into the game with the ball... These are great opportunities for our guys that are going to build a solid foundation.”\n\nThe Galaxy's midfield is slowly getting replenished, Vanney told reporters Isaiah Parente and Elijah Wynder are progressing and could be \"part of the group\" on Wednesday. He added Erik Thommy could make his debut Saturday against Charlotte and defender Chris Rindov was \"a little further behind\"\n\nKickoff is set for 8:30 p.m. from Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nLocation: Dignity Health Sports Park, Carson, Calif.\n\nRadio: LA Galaxy Youtube Channel.",

    "description": "These Galaxy devices can install Samsung's latest patches.",
    "fullText": "This is going to be a big week for Samsung. The company is making some major announcements at Galaxy Unpacked 2026 on Wednesday, revealing the next generation Galaxy S Series devices (which almost assuredly means the Galaxy S26), as well as some new AI updates. In the lead up to this event, Samsung is also now rolling out its latest security updates for its Galaxy devices—at least, some of its devices.\n\nSamsung's February security update contains 37 patches for issues the company discovered since the January update. This time, there are no critical patches, but there are plenty of fixes for \"High\" severity issues. According to SamMobile, 25 of these patches were provided by Google, which fix issues with Android in general, while the other 12 were specific to Samsung to patch issues within its own ecosystem. That includes issues for Emergency Sharing, Knox Guard Manager, Samsung Dialer, Samsung's Settings app, face and fingerprint authentication systems, and the PACM module—things that only apply to Samsung's own OS.\n\nNot all Galaxy phones are getting this update right away. Samsung is kicking things off with its Galaxy S25 series, meaning the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. It also appears to be rolling out to its latest foldable devices as well, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and Z TriFold. If you bought Samsung's latest and greatest—at least until the S26 series launches—you'll likely see the update in your Settings app imminently. If your Galaxy device is on the older side (or even one year older than the S25 series), you may need to wait a bit before the patches appear.\n\nSpeaking of waiting, Samsung started rolling this update out to Korean users first, so if you're in another region, you might not see it right away. But it does seem evident the patch is on its way, especially with Unpacked airing Wednesday.\n\nOnce the security update hits your device, open the Settings app, then choose either Software update or System updates. (This may differ depending on your device.) From here, depending on your carrier, tap either Download and install, Check for system updates, or Check for software updates. The latest update may begin downloading automatically, but if it doesn't, tap Download now. Finally, follow the on-screen instructions to install the update.",

    "fullText": "Samsung Unpacked 2026 is nearly upon us. On Wednesday, Feb. 25, Samsung will take the stage in San Francisco to make some pretty major product and feature announcements. Unlike some other big tech companies, however, Samsung isn't being 100% secretive here. The company has already told us that it will reveal the next Galaxy S Series, and while they haven't said exactly what it will be called, it's pretty safe to assume this will be the Galaxy S26 series. The rumors suggest Samsung has plenty of other updates up its sleeve, too, including the new Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy AI announcements.\n\nBased on the leaks and rumors, it seems the S26 series will likely be a small year-over-year update to the S25 series, which is largely to be expected from a smartphone OEM as big as Samsung. While there may not be too much incentive to update from the S25 series, users of older Galaxy devices, or older smartphones in general, may find the processor and camera upgrades worthwhile. There may also be unique features, like Privacy Display, which can make it more difficult for others to see your screen when they're not looking at it head-on. We'll have to see exactly which rumors pan out to know for sure.\n\nYou don't need to be seated in San Francisco in order to keep up with all the Samsung news, though. We'll be covering the event live as it happens, posting to this live blog throughout the day. That means we'll be reporting when Samsung reveals the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra; all the new features those devices come with; and any new accessories and AI advancements you can expect from the Samsung ecosystem. For all the latest Samsung Unpacked 2026 news, keep checking this live blog throughout Wednesday.",
