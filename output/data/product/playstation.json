    "title": "There Is No Xbox Wrapped This Year -- Here’s Why It Might Not Be Happening",
    "description": "It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the PlayStation Wrap-Up, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?\nWhile it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to Windows Central, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.\nThe Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40.",

From this simple premise comes a joyful game of mindfulness and social interaction, as Alta learns how to serve up witty conversation and decent hot drinks. Colourful and highly stylised, it is a thoughtful study of burnout and recovery.\n\nInkle/Nintendo Switch, iPhone/iPad, Mac, PC\nAn attempted-murder mystery set in an a 1920s all-girls private school reveals itself to also be an eviscerating takedown of British class politics. Witty and beautifully drawn, it is full of amusing boarding-school stereotypes, from self-interested prefects to a terrifying matron, whose motivations and personal grievances must be slowly unpicked. It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.\n\nSupergiant Games, PC, Switch\n\n A stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.\n\nSokpop Collectiv, PC\n\n A gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.\n\nMegagon Industries, PC, Xbox\n\n All is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.\n\nCapcom, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n Capcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.\n\nHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Two aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.\n\n11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n After crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.\n\nPanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Set at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.\n\nTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n The Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.\n\nSucker Punch/Sony, PS5\n\n A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing the shamisen or wielding a sumi-e ink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.\n\nKojima Productions/Sony, PS5\n\n Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.\n\nSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n An extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.\n\nHexecutable, PC \n\n A satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funny and has a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.\n\nSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PC\n\n It’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.\n\nNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n In 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.\n\nTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n Even the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.\n\nDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n A young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.",

    "title": "Tomb Raider Remake Will Be Easier To Cater For \"Modern Player Tastes\"",
    "description": "Crystal Dynamics announced Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis last week at The Game Awards, calling it a reimagining of the original 1996 Tomb Raider. While the studio wants to stay faithful to the original, it has also said it plans to tone down the brutal difficulty of the nearly 30-year-old PlayStation 1 game.\nSpeaking in a press conference, as reported by GamesRadar, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked about adapting the original PS1 game specifically when it comes to difficulty. Like many games of its era, the 1996 game was known to have its punishingly difficult sections, including insta-kill death traps that were often near-impossible to avoid without the benefit of hindsight.\n\"Part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes,\" Kerslake said, and though he doesn't explicitly mention difficulty it seems safe to say that Legacy of Atlantis will have far fewer insta-kills.",

    "fullText": "How can you possibly squeeze a 32-bit PlayStation CD ROM game into a small Game Boy Color Cartridge? Well, HotGen would attempt to do just that with a conversion of Resident Evil in mid-1999 and to make it as close as possible with similar 3D perspectives using scaled sprites.\n\nThere were delays and a lot of struggles to cram everything in. There were of course a number of restrictions and tweaks made along the way, but HotGen had a pretty decent stab at it and had a title which was certainly pushing the 8-bit hardware.\n\nRetained were the original game’s locations, viewpoints, puzzles, pre-rendered backgrounds and dialogue. Characters and enemies were software-scaled, with technical compromises required due to the GBC’s limited CPU power and storage. Speech was replaced with text windows, but the structure of the PlayStation original remained largely intact.\n\nWhen we spoke to developer Nigel Speight as part of our book coverage in 2020, he had the following recollections about the development:\n\n“If I remember correctly I would say the game was about 75-85% complete. Originally the game was supposed to be about 35% of the original PlayStation version and we were going to elongate the storyline to keep reusing the rooms. However, as time went along Virgin kept upping the cartridge size and wanting more of the original content in. If I remember correctly I’d created an editor that allowed the 3d to be aligned to the screens and objects placed etc and I think that the last build we made didn’t include the final amount of content me and the artist Martin Smith had created.”\n\nThe game had been shown at places like E3 in 1999, and had been planned for release by the Christmas of that year – though delays meant it slipped into early 2000. By February 2000, the game was nearing completion and was being tested. However, Capcom decided to cancel the title, feeling that the game wasn’t up to scratch.\n\nAssistant programmer Pete Frith (back in 2020 when questioned by us) couldn’t recall the completion state, but felt it was more 98% finished, as there was a lot of communications between the team and QA testers at the end. He also recalls that the story they were told regarding the cancellation, was that the original creator of Resident Evil didn’t feel the GBC was worthy of his creation, and that he had personally instructed the cancellation. He also informed that the lead artist Martin Smith had sadly passed away.\n\nWhere Martin focused on the backgrounds, Simon Butler did the sprite work on the game. Mark Cooksey was then on hand to create all the music and sound effects, though many would not get properly integrated it seems.\n\nThankfully, in 2011 – two separate builds were preserved thanks to Kiff Storey and Bowker. One version was quite near to completion, but was missing intro titles and had debug screens on and was felt to be around 90% complete. A long-play online confirmed that the game wasn’t completable either for both characters.\n\nIn late 2025 however, Games That Weren’t have now preserved a final version of game at the point of cancellation and we have it here for you today to check out thanks to Pete Frith providing everything. Again, it isn’t 100% complete (perhaps now 98% – based on Pete’s estimates) – but there is more content and it *might* actually now be completable. Due to time constraints, we’ve not been able to sit and play through the title fully to confirm, as there might be scenes that glitch/bug out – if you find that it is, please do let us know!\n\nCrucially, we know that the Tyrant seems to be present at the end (see below) and its possible to trigger the end sequence compared to the earlier builds. We have a hack further below that jumps you near the end, so that you can see this for yourself.\n\nThe debug data present in other builds has been removed in the final build, and there are a set of introduction credit screens present in this version. Also, hacking through the game – the end sequences are in place too, which gives promise that the game may be completable in its current final state. Just in case it isn’t, we’ve created a few hacks which allow the following to unlock some unseen content:\n\n1) ResiEvilHack-EndingSelector: This allows you to just select either character and jump straight to the end sequences for both.\n\n2) ResiEvilHack-TyrantSegments: This hack jumps near towards the end of the game, where the tyrant is now walking around the final outside scene if you select Chris Redfield. If you select Jill Valentine, it starts you in the lab with the tyrant moving around (though its just their silloette).\n\nYou can’t seem to kill the Tyrant with the knife with Chris (though you might be able to find a weapon nearby). However, if you play with Jill and navigate towards the outside helicopter pad – the tyrant is there, and you can use your gun to kill them – triggering the end sequence.\n\n3) ResiEvilHack-SceneNMusicPlayer: This is quite a cool hack. Firstly, if you select either character – it will play through all the animated scenes for that player in sequence. It is likely there will be a few scenes here which were not used in the game or integrated. Then if you press “B” on the same selector screen, you will be able to play through all the SFX and pressing “SELECT” will cycle through all the tunes created by Mark Cooksey.\n\nIn a note found to the developers, Mark listed all the music and SFX as follows (with his original descriptions):\n\n0 Silence tune (Skipped in selector)\n 1 Long Background tune #1\n 2 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #1\n 3 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #2 *modified tune *\n 4 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #3 *new tune to replace old one *\n 5 Short Dramatic danger loop tune #4 * modified tune *\n 6 BG00 from res evil\n 7 Long Background tune #2\n 8 Long Background tune #3\n 9 Moonlight sonata correct\n 10 Moonlight sonata played badly correct\n 11 Long background tune #4\n 12 Girly end of game tune * new tune *\n\n0 Police card (char) select\n 1 Option move from one to another\n 2 select (highlight option)\n 3 Cancel\n 4 Wooden door open\n 5 Wooden door close\n 6 clock ticking VERSION 1 Looping\n 7 Stop clock 1 ticking\n 8 clock ticking VERSION 2 BETTER THAN 1 Lp\n 9 Stop clock 2 ticking\n 10 Footstep #1 on carpet\n 11 Single hard footstep\n 12 Double footstep #1 Gravel use together\n 13 Double footstep #2 left foot then RFoot\n 14 Long Footstep for wading through water\n 15 Gun shot #1 n\n 16 Gun shot #2\n 17 Knife swipe 1 Shorter\n 18 Knife swipe 2 Longer\n 19 Zombie Moan 1 (1 channel fx)\n 20 Zombie Moan 2 (2 channel fx more real)\n 21 Zombie Chomp (bite)\n 22 Teleprinter type sound 1 shot\n 23 Go on to next screen after pick char\n 24 Page Turn\n 25 Gun Reload 1 REVOLVER\n 26 Gun reload 2 Shotgun\n 27 Gun Reload 3 ???\n 28 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 29 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 30 Bloke Aaah being attacked.\n 31 Girl Aaah being attacked.\n 32 Push Furniture (continuous)\n 33 Stop push furniture\n 34 Bees\n 35 Break stone\n 36 Gate Noise\n 37 Lift start (loops)\n 38 Lift stop\n 39 Key open (key apar)\n 40 Power on\n 41 Computer key click\n\nIn addition to this, we have extracted out a set of assets used for the game – which may contain sprites/sequences not used in the final game. Also, the original WAV samples that Pete Frith created from his voice to make the speech on the title screen – including some versions that were not used :)\n\nWhat else have we established so far?\n\nIf you spot anything else – please feel free to get in touch or leave something in the comments and we’ll update the page over time. For now, we hope you enjoy taking a look at what has been recovered and enjoy the findings so far. We have also included two bonus builds that we also located which will have some minor differences too.\n\nWith a huge thank you to Pete Frith for allowing us to preserve and for the assets and to Nigel Speight for his recollections.",

    "description": "Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is having a remarkable second run this month after winning Game of the Year at The Game Awards. It was already one of the top hits of the year, but that added exposure has pushed Expedition 33 even higher than before.\nAccording to Alinea Analytics, sales of Expedition 33 jumped 21% on PlayStation 5 and 76% on Steam. The bump was a considerably smaller 3% on Xbox, likely because Expedition 33 is on Game Pass. Regardless, the combined sales across PC and consoles post-The Game Awards is estimated to be over 200,000 additional copies.",

Not only have those ports been well received, but they've also been best-sellers, and next year will see the arrival of Halo and Forza Horizon on PlayStation. In a new interview, Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, spoke about the success of Xbox games on PS5 and the reaction to Halo's announcement for PS5.\n\"We had a bit of a moment earlier in the summer from end of April to end of June, where we had six of the top 10 games on PlayStation were our Xbox games,\" Booty said to Variety. \"I look at that as validation for the teams, but most importantly, it's an opportunity for more players to engage with our content, to come into our worlds.",

We then cut to some actual gameplay of our protagonist, the elite assassin Soul, as he travels around various environments, enters various cutscenes, and engages in various battles. It's not quite a souls-like, but based on combat encounters and enemy designs, you'd think it was one.

And if you're more interested in staying in the modern era, we also have a list of the best games to play with a PlayStation Plus Extra or Premium membership. For a full look at the new PS Plus service, take a look at our roundup of every game available in the PS Plus library.\n\nAlthough it’s been somewhat overshadowed by the games that came after it, Fallout 3 was a major turning point for the franchise. This was the first 3D Fallout game, and many of the gameplay mechanics have been celebrated in its successors. Bethesda also attracted some top-notch voice talent for this one, including Liam Neeson, who voices the father of the player’s character.\n\nAfter emerging from a Vault, players get to explore the Washington D.C. area and follow the primary and side missions to enjoy up to 100 hours or \n\nNinja Theory’s Heavenly Sword felt like it was meant to be the beginning of the next great franchise. Instead, it was a one-and-done with fantastic graphics and gameplay that put players in the role of Nariko, a woman who dares to take up the Heavenly Sword to protect her family and clan even though it will slowly overtake her body and destroy her.\n\nThe combat is fluid and a hell of a lot of fun when using the sword to take a large number of enemies on-screen. There are also a few times when players control Nariko’s closest friend, Kai, who has projectile weapons that you can aim and glide towards an enemy with the turn of a controller. This game doesn’t just deserve a modern remaster, it needs a sequel.\n\nRead our Heavenly Sword review.\n\nKonami has left the Castlevania franchise on the shelf for over a decade, and the only way to revisit the reboot, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, is by diving into it on PS Plus Premium. Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima was one of the producers for this title, which reimagined the entire Castlevania mythos and gave the gameplay the 3D makeover it needed.\n\nIn this version of the story, players take control of Gabriel Belmont, a holy warrior for the Brotherhood of Light. Gabriel’s wife, Marie, has been murdered by one of the supernatural creatures he was born to fight. But because Marie’s soul is trapped, she serves as Gabriel’s guide as he takes up a quest to not only save the world, but restore his wife to life. This is a wildly underrated title, and we need more Castlevania games like this.\n\nRead our Castlevania: Lords of Shadow review.\n\nGamers of a certain age should remember Sly Cooper, the anthropomorphic raccoon and master thief who was the main character of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus on PlayStation 2. That game and its first two sequels--Sly 2: Band of Thieves and Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves--were remastered for PlayStation 3 as part of The Sly Collection, and they have withstood the test of time.\n\nThe original versions of the trilogy were developed by Sucker Punch before the studio went on to release Infamous and Ghost of Tsushima. You’ll recognize the DNA of those games by the way Sly moves on rooftops and the way he utilizes stealth to remain undetected. Now, someone just needs to pull off a heist so Sly can get the comeback he deserves.\n\nWhile Arkham Origins game may not have been helmed by Rocksteady Games, developer Warner Bros. Montreal still did an admirable job with this prequel. Featuring all the combat, stealth, and detective work you'd expect from a Batman game, this Arkham title hit all three bat-nails on the bat-heads.\n\nRead our Batman Arkham Origins review.\n\nDecades after they were first released, the Devil May Cry games--yes, even the controversial second one--still stand tall as excellent action romps. Demonic hordes, stylish combat, and a protagonist with a devil-may-care attitude are just some of the reasons why Capcom's classic trilogy deserves a revisit. We recommend playing them in order, but if time is an issue, Devil May Cry 3 holds up better than its predecessors.\n\nRead our Devil May Cry HD Collection review.\n\nA cult-classic Japanese tactics series, you can grab several Disgaea games on PS Plus and feel what it's like to deliver ridiculous numbers of damage, forge relationships, and master exotic weapons within the fantasy frame of these titles. Just the Disgaea games alone offer hundreds of hours of compelling PS3 streaming content.\n\nA technical achievement at the time, The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion's open-world design was nothing short of stunning when it first released in 2006. 16 years later, the game is still a treat, with its in-your-face swords and sorcery action, excellent voice-acting, and dark fantasy tale centered around a Daedra invasion.\n\nRead our The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion review.\n\nBefore it was developing an underrated Devil May Cry reboot or the Senua's Saga series, developer Ninja Theory was making a name for itself with Enslaved. A new take on the classic tale, Enslaved pivots from ancient China to the far future for a thrilling tale of action in a robot post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nRead our Enslaved: Odyssey to the West review.\n\nFallout 3 brought the Bethesda series into a new dimension, but Obsidian Entertainment's spin-off is arguably the most well-remembered entry in the series. The gameplay was largely the same, but the extra improvements, incredible characters, and a fascinating new region made this Fallout the gold standard of the post-apocalyptic franchise. Fallout 3 is also on PS Plus Premium, and it's still worth playing, too.\n\nRead our Fallout New Vegas review.\n\nLiving up to its name, FEAR was part first-person shooter and part psychological horror that combined to create an effective package of high-caliber thrills. Everything from the sound design to the atmospheric levels was a showcase of how to give your audience multiple heart attacks, and even with several sequels, the first FEAR is still the cold standard for terror.\n\nThe original Greek adventures that set a new benchmark for games with brutal combat and quick-time events, the first two God of War games are fascinating throwbacks to the past that introduced the world to Kratos and his undying rage. The HD versions of these PS2 classics are still a treat to play in 2022.\n\nWhile there certainly wasn't a shortage of official PGA games during the PS3 era, but Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational was easily the best arcade golf game on the console. Originally released on the PS Vita, this port spruced up the product and made it feel even better with PS Move features that put you right in the game. Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds is also available to stream on PS Plus, so if you get bored of the courses in World Invitational, there's plenty more golfing fun to be had in Out of Bounds.\n\nRead our Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational review.\n\nIn an era where the PS2 was home to a regular influx of hit games, Ico stood out from the pack with its more tranquil puzzle gameplay and novel storytelling methods. Fast-forward a few years into the future, and an HD remaster brought all of that magic back in a new light.\n\nBefore it was developing an incredible samurai sandbox in Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch was known as the Infamous studio for good reason. An absolute power fantasy trip with fascinating consequences depending on your morality, the Infamous games still make for electrifying entertainment.\n\nReleased at a time when Mega Man had been absent from home consoles for years, the ninth and tenth installments in the series showed that the Blue Bomber hadn't lost his charm during his hiatus. Challenging and colorful, these Mega Man games were some of the best that the franchise had to offer. They captured the nostalgia of early Mega Man games by replicating the pixelated visuals while taking advantage of modern advancements in technology.\n\nThe fourth time was the charm for the Motorstorm series, as Apocalypse upped the ante with its rich selection of vehicles, well-designed tracks, and destructible environments that made each race a nail-biting sprint across hostile terrain.\n\nRead our Motorstorm: Apocalypse review.\n\nShinobi style cranked up to the maximum, Ryu Hayabusa's PS3 adventures were nothing short of effortlessly cool action mixed with devastating difficult gameplay. The Sigma games are harder than a freshly forged kunai, but they're still rewarding to play.\n\nRead our Ninja Gaiden Sigma review.\n\nVisually striking, PixelJunk Eden's Encore edition is a strange but fascinating game of platforming mixed with gardening. Sometimes serene, sometimes intense when the timer starts counting down; the lush visuals, distinct score, and surreal maneuverability makes for an unforgettable game.\n\nRead our PixelJunk Eden Encore review.\n\nPuppeteering might be the creepiest form of entertainment ever devised, but in the hands of SCE Japan, it's a medium that packs charm and imagination into a package of pure charm. Throw in some wonderful platforming, epic boss battles, and a killer soundtrack, and you've got a winner right here.\n\nA great Ratchet and Clank game is pure digital comfort food, and these two titles were simply delicious to dig into. Charming, witty, and full of great level design, PS Plus has a one-two punch of nostalgic fun waiting to be experienced in this pair of games. There are a couple other Ratchet games available to stream, but this pair keeps the traditional Ratchet & Clank gameplay.\n\nRead our Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus review.\n\nTaking a detour from the Grand Theft Auto series into wild west territory, Red Dead Redemption will amaze you with its cowboy sandbox and break your heart with its story. The standalone expansion, Undead Nightmare, is also plenty of fun as it adds a zombie mode that turns the entire game upside down.\n\nRead our Red Dead Redemption review.\n\nBefore the remake arrives, dive into Resident Evil 4 and marvel at how the series underwent a massive shift in tone and style. The controls might take some getting used to, but the rest of the game puts a terrific action spin on Resident Evil's trademark undead horror.\n\nRead our Resident Evil 4 review.\n\nThe final chapter in the Resistance saga is all action, alien devastation, and peak FPS fun from its era. Toss in some stomach-churning terror and a story that constantly increases in tension, and you'll be on the edge of your seat from the main menu through to the end credits.\n\nWhen Sam and Max made their return, it was nothing short of triumphant at the time. Reborn with a fancy new 3D aesthetic and 4D humor, these collections are perfect examples of hilarious storytelling and ingenious puzzles.\n\nRead our Sam and Max: Beyond Time and Space review.\n\nIf you ever wondered what would happen if Michael Bay decided to make a racing game, then Split/Second is your answer to that question. A solid arcade-style racing game, the real attention-grabber here was a selection of tracks that featured explosive turns and plenty of mayhem in every single race.\n\nThe tale of Darth Vader's secret apprentice may have been expunged from Star Wars continuity, but back then, these games were massively ambitious entries that sought to flesh out the years between the prequel and original trilogies. Living up to its name, the Force truly was unleashed in Starkiller's adventures across a galaxy far, far away.\n\nRead our Star Wars: The Force Unleashed review.\n\nStill revered as one of the most influential fighting games of all time, Street Fighter II also set a standard with several enhanced versions of the game that would be released over the years. Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is that legendary game at its best, packed with a great roster of characters, well-oiled fighting mechanics, and plenty of modern touches.\n\nRead our Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nFor a change of pace, grab a quick stream of the delightful puzzle-punching Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix. It's cute, captivating, and still plays like a dream.\n\nRead our Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nIn the mood for a dual-stick spaceship game that lets you see wonderfully colorful worlds as you turn enemy vessels into an explosive collection of pixels? Super Stardust HD has you covered with this stylish blast from the past.\n\nRead our Super Stardust HD review.\n\nPlatforming action starring a small blob might not sound too enticing, but this little gelatinous fellow combined magnetic traversal with relaxing puzzles and comfortable levels to explore. Two games, two adventures that can easily be enjoyed over a weekend.\n\nRead our Tales from Space: About a Blob review.\n\nEasily the weirdest title on this list, Tokyo Jungle is an examination of what life would be like for our beloved pets if humanity decided to just vanish off the face of the planet one day. It's a flawed gem, but one that sparkles with its absurd ideas and lively world.\n\nRevived for a new generation, Firaxis' XCOM was a welcome sight for anyone who felt that The Bureau had derailed the XCOM name. Pure tactical action and layered squad-building, this XCOM modernized the series for a new audience while keeping veterans engaged with its strategic content.\n\nRead our XCOM Enemy Within review.",

It was the first 3D outing for Ubisoft's mascot and received acclaim from critics, rivaling Crash Bandicoot, Banjo-Kazooie, and even Super Mario 64.\nTonic Trouble is also an Ubisoft original, though decidedly with a lesser reputation compared to Rayman 2.",

In case you missed it, the December free games for PS Plus subscribers--Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White--are also available to claim, so make certain to do so before January 5, 2026.\n\nIf you're curious to see just how much time you spent playing games this year, you can also check out the 2025 PlayStation Wrap-Up for a breakdown on which games you were focused on.\n\nFirst released in 2023, Assassin's Creed Mirage was billed as a return to the stealth-focused roots of the series. Set in ancient Baghdad, the game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq after he is recruited into the Hidden Ones and joins the fight against the Order of the Ancients.\n\nDeveloped by Team Ninja--the studio behind the Nioh games and co-developer of Ninja Gaiden 4--Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty is a fast-paced action game with parry-based combat that'll appeal to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice fans. Set during China's Three Kingdoms period of history, the game puts a dark fantasy and souls-like spin on this era of Chinese history.\n\nA day-one release, Skate Story puts you in control of a demon who makes a deal with the devil to swallow the moon. As if that didn't sound challenging enough, your demonic avatar also happens to be constructed from glass and pain, so any fumble is going to hurt really badly. Not only do you have to master your skateboard, but you also have to use it to overcome other demons, save tormented souls with your sick tricks, and discover the secrets of hell without taking a tumble.\n\nAs the captain of a skyfaring crew, you've got free rein to explore the floating archipelago of the Sky Realm in Granblue Fantasy: Relink and find the legendary island of Estalucia. That's easier said than done, as between enemy gangs and a growing plot in the background that threatens the entire Sky Realm, you'll have your work cut out for you in this fantasy game.\n\nLooking to become a theme park master? Then you'll want to grab a download of Planet Coaster 2 and start building some attention-grabbing rides. Building on the foundation set by its predecessor, Planet Coaster 2 offers more tools and resources to not only construct exciting water rides and coasters, but also the facilities to keep your park guests happy when they've got their feet firmly planted on the ground.\n\nThe Cat Quest games are delightful adventures full of terrific puns, and Cat Quest 3 doesn't disappoint. An open-world action-RPG set in a fantastical pirate-themed world known as the Purribean, the threequel sees players search for a long-lost mythical treasure and battle Pi-rats on the high seas. The game is also playable in solo or co-op modes.\n\nWe've seen Aloy's debut adventure on PS4 and remastered for PS5, but the Lego version puts a lighthearted spin on a familiar tale. Set in a world where humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain following a robot uprising, Lego Horizon Adventures follows Aloy as she sets out to prove herself and discover the lost secrets of the planet. You can hunt machines as Aloy, or you can play as her allies Varl, Teersa, and Erend in this colorful Lego game.\n\nFor the younger members of the family, you can boot up not one but two Paw Patrol games for them. The first one is a kart-racer featuring the gang, as they compete to win the Pup Cup.\n\nThe second Paw Patrol game is an action-adventure where you can play as the pups. Just like the animated series, you can drive their signature vehicles, engage in rescue missions, and explore Adventure Bay to help out citizens in need.\n\nPlayStation Plus Premium subscription required\n\nThe timeless tale of swords and souls is back, as Soulcalibur 3 joins the classics library this month. Originally released in 2005 for PS2, Soulcalibur 3 on PS5 and PS4 has been upgraded with enhanced visuals, quick-save and rewind functionality, and custom video filters.",

    "fullText": "Sam Eng/Devolver Digital, PC, PS5, Switch 2\nAn exquisitely fluid game of tricks, grinds and manuals is framed by a story that uncovers the poignancy of the infamously painful pastime\n\nSkateboarding video games live and die by their vibe. The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s beloved Skate franchise offered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.\n\nThe premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.\n\nThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.\n\nThe vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.\n\nThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.\n\nGradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.\n\nThese questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is \n\nThe result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.",

That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann.\nHe told XDA-Developers that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5.\nThe 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud.",
