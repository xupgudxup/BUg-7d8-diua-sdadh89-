    "description": "In 2012, programmer Chris Oberth passed away after a career that spanned from the dawn of video games in the late '70s to the PlayStation 2 era. Now, one of Oberth's unfinished games, Xcavator 2025, has been completed and it's slated for a physical release on the console it was originally intended for: the NES.\nThe Video Game History Foundation--with the permission and support of Oberth's family--found the source code for Xcavator 2025 in Oberth's development archives. It was originally developed by Incredible Technologies Inc., the company behind the Golden Tee Golf and Big Buck Hunter arcade games.",

From high-definition visuals to a plug-and-play setup for connecting to the Internet, the PS3 opened up a new world for gamers to explore. Plus, it had some terrific titles that could be played on it. Now that Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription service has been overhauled, you can dive into a library of PS3 classics with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. We've rounded up the best PS3 games to stream on PlayStation Plus.\n\nOur list includes games across a wide variety of genres. Some are well-known PlayStation exclusives that have been given new life on the PS5, while others are unsung gems that you may have missed out on during the PS3 era. Keep in mind that unlike other platforms in the new PS Plus library, you can only stream PlayStation 3 titles; you can't download them onto your console. That means you need a stable Wi-Fi connection or a hardwired ethernet connection (recommended) to play them.\n\nYou'll notice that our list includes several remakes and remasters from older PlayStation platforms that were added to the PS3 library. Any game that's streaming-only was eligible for this list. If you want to go further back in time, check out our list of the best classic PS1/PS2/PSP games to play with a PS Plus Premium subscription--classics and PS3 games are limited to Premium subscribers. And if you're more interested in staying in the modern era, we also have a list of the best games to play with a PlayStation Plus Extra or Premium membership. For a full look at the new PS Plus service, take a look at our roundup of every game available in the PS Plus library.\n\nAlthough it’s been somewhat overshadowed by the games that came after it, Fallout 3 was a major turning point for the franchise. This was the first 3D Fallout game, and many of the gameplay mechanics have been celebrated in its successors. Bethesda also attracted some top-notch voice talent for this one, including Liam Neeson, who voices the father of the player’s character.\n\nAfter emerging from a Vault, players get to explore the Washington D.C. area and follow the primary and side missions to enjoy up to 100 hours or \n\nNinja Theory’s Heavenly Sword felt like it was meant to be the beginning of the next great franchise. Instead, it was a one-and-done with fantastic graphics and gameplay that put players in the role of Nariko, a woman who dares to take up the Heavenly Sword to protect her family and clan even though it will slowly overtake her body and destroy her.\n\nThe combat is fluid and a hell of a lot of fun when using the sword to take a large number of enemies on-screen. There are also a few times when players control Nariko’s closest friend, Kai, who has projectile weapons that you can aim and glide towards an enemy with the turn of a controller. This game doesn’t just deserve a modern remaster, it needs a sequel.\n\nRead our Heavenly Sword review.\n\nKonami has left the Castlevania franchise on the shelf for over a decade, and the only way to revisit the reboot, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, is by diving into it on PS Plus Premium. Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima was one of the producers for this title, which reimagined the entire Castlevania mythos and gave the gameplay the 3D makeover it needed.\n\nIn this version of the story, players take control of Gabriel Belmont, a holy warrior for the Brotherhood of Light. Gabriel’s wife, Marie, has been murdered by one of the supernatural creatures he was born to fight. But because Marie’s soul is trapped, she serves as Gabriel’s guide as he takes up a quest to not only save the world, but restore his wife to life. This is a wildly underrated title, and we need more Castlevania games like this.\n\nRead our Castlevania: Lords of Shadow review.\n\nGamers of a certain age should remember Sly Cooper, the anthropomorphic raccoon and master thief who was the main character of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus on PlayStation 2. That game and its first two sequels--Sly 2: Band of Thieves and Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves--were remastered for PlayStation 3 as part of The Sly Collection, and they have withstood the test of time.\n\nThe original versions of the trilogy were developed by Sucker Punch before the studio went on to release Infamous and Ghost of Tsushima. You’ll recognize the DNA of those games by the way Sly moves on rooftops and the way he utilizes stealth to remain undetected. Now, someone just needs to pull off a heist so Sly can get the comeback he deserves.\n\nWhile Arkham Origins game may not have been helmed by Rocksteady Games, developer Warner Bros. Montreal still did an admirable job with this prequel. Featuring all the combat, stealth, and detective work you'd expect from a Batman game, this Arkham title hit all three bat-nails on the bat-heads.\n\nRead our Batman Arkham Origins review.\n\nDecades after they were first released, the Devil May Cry games--yes, even the controversial second one--still stand tall as excellent action romps. Demonic hordes, stylish combat, and a protagonist with a devil-may-care attitude are just some of the reasons why Capcom's classic trilogy deserves a revisit. We recommend playing them in order, but if time is an issue, Devil May Cry 3 holds up better than its predecessors.\n\nRead our Devil May Cry HD Collection review.\n\nA cult-classic Japanese tactics series, you can grab several Disgaea games on PS Plus and feel what it's like to deliver ridiculous numbers of damage, forge relationships, and master exotic weapons within the fantasy frame of these titles. Just the Disgaea games alone offer hundreds of hours of compelling PS3 streaming content.\n\nA technical achievement at the time, The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion's open-world design was nothing short of stunning when it first released in 2006. 16 years later, the game is still a treat, with its in-your-face swords and sorcery action, excellent voice-acting, and dark fantasy tale centered around a Daedra invasion.\n\nRead our The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion review.\n\nBefore it was developing an underrated Devil May Cry reboot or the Senua's Saga series, developer Ninja Theory was making a name for itself with Enslaved. A new take on the classic tale, Enslaved pivots from ancient China to the far future for a thrilling tale of action in a robot post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nRead our Enslaved: Odyssey to the West review.\n\nFallout 3 brought the Bethesda series into a new dimension, but Obsidian Entertainment's spin-off is arguably the most well-remembered entry in the series. The gameplay was largely the same, but the extra improvements, incredible characters, and a fascinating new region made this Fallout the gold standard of the post-apocalyptic franchise. Fallout 3 is also on PS Plus Premium, and it's still worth playing, too.\n\nRead our Fallout New Vegas review.\n\nLiving up to its name, FEAR was part first-person shooter and part psychological horror that combined to create an effective package of high-caliber thrills. Everything from the sound design to the atmospheric levels was a showcase of how to give your audience multiple heart attacks, and even with several sequels, the first FEAR is still the cold standard for terror.\n\nThe original Greek adventures that set a new benchmark for games with brutal combat and quick-time events, the first two God of War games are fascinating throwbacks to the past that introduced the world to Kratos and his undying rage. The HD versions of these PS2 classics are still a treat to play in 2022.\n\nWhile there certainly wasn't a shortage of official PGA games during the PS3 era, but Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational was easily the best arcade golf game on the console. Originally released on the PS Vita, this port spruced up the product and made it feel even better with PS Move features that put you right in the game. Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds is also available to stream on PS Plus, so if you get bored of the courses in World Invitational, there's plenty more golfing fun to be had in Out of Bounds.\n\nRead our Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational review.\n\nIn an era where the PS2 was home to a regular influx of hit games, Ico stood out from the pack with its more tranquil puzzle gameplay and novel storytelling methods. Fast-forward a few years into the future, and an HD remaster brought all of that magic back in a new light.\n\nBefore it was developing an incredible samurai sandbox in Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch was known as the Infamous studio for good reason. An absolute power fantasy trip with fascinating consequences depending on your morality, the Infamous games still make for electrifying entertainment.\n\nReleased at a time when Mega Man had been absent from home consoles for years, the ninth and tenth installments in the series showed that the Blue Bomber hadn't lost his charm during his hiatus. Challenging and colorful, these Mega Man games were some of the best that the franchise had to offer. They captured the nostalgia of early Mega Man games by replicating the pixelated visuals while taking advantage of modern advancements in technology.\n\nThe fourth time was the charm for the Motorstorm series, as Apocalypse upped the ante with its rich selection of vehicles, well-designed tracks, and destructible environments that made each race a nail-biting sprint across hostile terrain.\n\nRead our Motorstorm: Apocalypse review.\n\nShinobi style cranked up to the maximum, Ryu Hayabusa's PS3 adventures were nothing short of effortlessly cool action mixed with devastating difficult gameplay. The Sigma games are harder than a freshly forged kunai, but they're still rewarding to play.\n\nRead our Ninja Gaiden Sigma review.\n\nVisually striking, PixelJunk Eden's Encore edition is a strange but fascinating game of platforming mixed with gardening. Sometimes serene, sometimes intense when the timer starts counting down; the lush visuals, distinct score, and surreal maneuverability makes for an unforgettable game.\n\nRead our PixelJunk Eden Encore review.\n\nPuppeteering might be the creepiest form of entertainment ever devised, but in the hands of SCE Japan, it's a medium that packs charm and imagination into a package of pure charm. Throw in some wonderful platforming, epic boss battles, and a killer soundtrack, and you've got a winner right here.\n\nA great Ratchet and Clank game is pure digital comfort food, and these two titles were simply delicious to dig into. Charming, witty, and full of great level design, PS Plus has a one-two punch of nostalgic fun waiting to be experienced in this pair of games. There are a couple other Ratchet games available to stream, but this pair keeps the traditional Ratchet & Clank gameplay.\n\nRead our Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus review.\n\nTaking a detour from the Grand Theft Auto series into wild west territory, Red Dead Redemption will amaze you with its cowboy sandbox and break your heart with its story. The standalone expansion, Undead Nightmare, is also plenty of fun as it adds a zombie mode that turns the entire game upside down.\n\nRead our Red Dead Redemption review.\n\nBefore the remake arrives, dive into Resident Evil 4 and marvel at how the series underwent a massive shift in tone and style. The controls might take some getting used to, but the rest of the game puts a terrific action spin on Resident Evil's trademark undead horror.\n\nRead our Resident Evil 4 review.\n\nThe final chapter in the Resistance saga is all action, alien devastation, and peak FPS fun from its era. Toss in some stomach-churning terror and a story that constantly increases in tension, and you'll be on the edge of your seat from the main menu through to the end credits.\n\nWhen Sam and Max made their return, it was nothing short of triumphant at the time. Reborn with a fancy new 3D aesthetic and 4D humor, these collections are perfect examples of hilarious storytelling and ingenious puzzles.\n\nRead our Sam and Max: Beyond Time and Space review.\n\nIf you ever wondered what would happen if Michael Bay decided to make a racing game, then Split/Second is your answer to that question. A solid arcade-style racing game, the real attention-grabber here was a selection of tracks that featured explosive turns and plenty of mayhem in every single race.\n\nThe tale of Darth Vader's secret apprentice may have been expunged from Star Wars continuity, but back then, these games were massively ambitious entries that sought to flesh out the years between the prequel and original trilogies. Living up to its name, the Force truly was unleashed in Starkiller's adventures across a galaxy far, far away.\n\nRead our Star Wars: The Force Unleashed review.\n\nStill revered as one of the most influential fighting games of all time, Street Fighter II also set a standard with several enhanced versions of the game that would be released over the years. Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is that legendary game at its best, packed with a great roster of characters, well-oiled fighting mechanics, and plenty of modern touches.\n\nRead our Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nFor a change of pace, grab a quick stream of the delightful puzzle-punching Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix. It's cute, captivating, and still plays like a dream.\n\nRead our Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nIn the mood for a dual-stick spaceship game that lets you see wonderfully colorful worlds as you turn enemy vessels into an explosive collection of pixels? Super Stardust HD has you covered with this stylish blast from the past.\n\nRead our Super Stardust HD review.\n\nPlatforming action starring a small blob might not sound too enticing, but this little gelatinous fellow combined magnetic traversal with relaxing puzzles and comfortable levels to explore. Two games, two adventures that can easily be enjoyed over a weekend.\n\nRead our Tales from Space: About a Blob review.\n\nEasily the weirdest title on this list, Tokyo Jungle is an examination of what life would be like for our beloved pets if humanity decided to just vanish off the face of the planet one day. It's a flawed gem, but one that sparkles with its absurd ideas and lively world.\n\nRevived for a new generation, Firaxis' XCOM was a welcome sight for anyone who felt that The Bureau had derailed the XCOM name. Pure tactical action and layered squad-building, this XCOM modernized the series for a new audience while keeping veterans engaged with its strategic content.\n\nRead our XCOM Enemy Within review.",

    "description": "An absolute classic is one of two Nintendo 64 games set to join the Nintendo Classics library this month. Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble, both from Ubisoft, will be available to play for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers starting December 17.\nRayman 2 was originally released in 1999 for Nintendo 64 and PC, with ports on Dreamcast, PlayStation, and other platforms following in subsequent years. It was the first 3D outing for Ubisoft's mascot and received acclaim from critics, rivaling Crash Bandicoot, Banjo-Kazooie, and even Super Mario 64.\nTonic Trouble is also an Ubisoft original, though decidedly with a lesser reputation compared to Rayman 2.",

In case you missed it, the December free games for PS Plus subscribers--Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White--are also available to claim, so make certain to do so before January 5, 2026.\n\nIf you're curious to see just how much time you spent playing games this year, you can also check out the 2025 PlayStation Wrap-Up for a breakdown on which games you were focused on.\n\nFirst released in 2023, Assassin's Creed Mirage was billed as a return to the stealth-focused roots of the series. Set in ancient Baghdad, the game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq after he is recruited into the Hidden Ones and joins the fight against the Order of the Ancients.\n\nDeveloped by Team Ninja--the studio behind the Nioh games and co-developer of Ninja Gaiden 4--Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty is a fast-paced action game with parry-based combat that'll appeal to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice fans. Set during China's Three Kingdoms period of history, the game puts a dark fantasy and souls-like spin on this era of Chinese history.\n\nA day-one release, Skate Story puts you in control of a demon who makes a deal with the devil to swallow the moon. As if that didn't sound challenging enough, your demonic avatar also happens to be constructed from glass and pain, so any fumble is going to hurt really badly. Not only do you have to master your skateboard, but you also have to use it to overcome other demons, save tormented souls with your sick tricks, and discover the secrets of hell without taking a tumble.\n\nAs the captain of a skyfaring crew, you've got free rein to explore the floating archipelago of the Sky Realm in Granblue Fantasy: Relink and find the legendary island of Estalucia. That's easier said than done, as between enemy gangs and a growing plot in the background that threatens the entire Sky Realm, you'll have your work cut out for you in this fantasy game.\n\nLooking to become a theme park master? Then you'll want to grab a download of Planet Coaster 2 and start building some attention-grabbing rides. Building on the foundation set by its predecessor, Planet Coaster 2 offers more tools and resources to not only construct exciting water rides and coasters, but also the facilities to keep your park guests happy when they've got their feet firmly planted on the ground.\n\nThe Cat Quest games are delightful adventures full of terrific puns, and Cat Quest 3 doesn't disappoint. An open-world action-RPG set in a fantastical pirate-themed world known as the Purribean, the threequel sees players search for a long-lost mythical treasure and battle Pi-rats on the high seas. The game is also playable in solo or co-op modes.\n\nWe've seen Aloy's debut adventure on PS4 and remastered for PS5, but the Lego version puts a lighthearted spin on a familiar tale. Set in a world where humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain following a robot uprising, Lego Horizon Adventures follows Aloy as she sets out to prove herself and discover the lost secrets of the planet. You can hunt machines as Aloy, or you can play as her allies Varl, Teersa, and Erend in this colorful Lego game.\n\nFor the younger members of the family, you can boot up not one but two Paw Patrol games for them. The first one is a kart-racer featuring the gang, as they compete to win the Pup Cup.\n\nThe second Paw Patrol game is an action-adventure where you can play as the pups. Just like the animated series, you can drive their signature vehicles, engage in rescue missions, and explore Adventure Bay to help out citizens in need.\n\nPlayStation Plus Premium subscription required\n\nThe timeless tale of swords and souls is back, as Soulcalibur 3 joins the classics library this month. Originally released in 2005 for PS2, Soulcalibur 3 on PS5 and PS4 has been upgraded with enhanced visuals, quick-save and rewind functionality, and custom video filters.",

PlayStation 5 players noticed the art on the pre-download screen for owners of the standard (non-Deluxe) version of the game.\nIGN later confirmed the art, which showed a stubbled and haggard-looking Leon hovering over Requiem's other main protagonist, Grace Ashcroft. Leon appeared similar to his Resident Evil 4 look, with his fur-lined leather jacket, albeit a bit more grizzled.",

The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s beloved Skate franchise offered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.\n\nThe premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.\n\nThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.\n\nThe vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.\n\nThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.\n\nGradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.\n\nThese questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is \n\nThe result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.",

    "description": "Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a \"whole avalanche\" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann.\nHe told XDA-Developers that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5.\nThe 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud.",
