Here are the best games you weren’t playing this year\n\n The 20 best video games of 2025\n\n More on the best culture of 2025\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nHave you ever wanted to romance your record player? Date Everything! offers players the chance to develop relationships with everyday objects around your house, in a fully voiced sandbox romp featuring over 100 anthropomorphised characters. Wonderfully meta; you can put the moves on the textbox, or even “Michael Transaction” (microtransaction – get it?) himself. Meghan Ellis\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nA raucous debut by indie studio à la mode games, Sorry We’re Closed is a survival horror where the monster is love and the dungeon is a dingy London neighbourhood. Fight demons, fend off unwanted admirers and survive work shifts in this queer, neon homage to 1990s PlayStation-era horror. ME\n\nWeb browser\nThe trick of this daily logic puzzle is that you can’t guess, or make wrong answers. Presented with a grid of characters, you must identify the “innocent” and the “criminal” based on clues revealed with each correct answer. But the game will only accept an answer if it’s sure you know it for a fact. An idealistic vision of a criminal justice system. Duncan Fyfe\n\nSwitch, Playdate, PC\nBlippo+ is a channel surfing simulator that rides the line between video game and absurd cable subscription service. Experienced entirely by trawling through the interface of a virtual TV guide, you can tune into intergalactic music videos, curious cooking shows, and psychic weather reports, learning an alien culture through charming live-action skits that evoke the sketch comedy of Tim and Eric. Sarah Thwaites\n\nSwitch, PC\nA sequel in all but name to Love-de-Lic’s 1997 role-playing game satire Moon, Stray Children is a monster-taming adventure where you whisper away the worries of troubled “Olders” that have come to dominate the inhabitants of an unfinished video game. Finessed by a crunchy pixel art style and a combat system inspired by Undertale, this nostalgic odyssey will pull on your heartstrings while testing your reflexes at the same time. ST\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nA fiendish, almost cruelly addictive mashup of Vampire Survivors-esque monster horde control and Breakout-style ball-bouncing. Descend into a pit full of demons and shoot a continuous stream of richocheting, burning, poisonous and otherwise deadly balls at them until the screen is just a brain-melting confusion of visual effects. Keza MacDonald\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nYou are a cheerful pubescent boy with a unique problem: your arms are stuck out in a T-pose. How do you navigate school, family, friendships and brushing your teeth when you can’t bend your arms? A sweet, family friendly slice-of-life physical comedy game with an unexpectedly affecting message, and excellent songs sung by a gourmand giraffe. KM\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nJust a chill bike-racing game where your ride is possessed by an ancient speed spirit. Wheel around a soothingly minimalist island of cycling obsessives, picking up new swappable bike parts and blasting past local gangs of racers on downhill courses. Uncomplicated, good looking and thoughtfully put together. KM\n\nPC\nPowerhoof’s excellent pixelated point-and-click game teases its dystopian plot throughout, mixing influences such as The Thing, Michael Crichton’s Coma and Total Recall. It’s an intriguing mix: combined with a heartfelt story full of painful human emotions and some fantastic audio, it’s a tense yet warming tale, guaranteed to coil its way around your heart. Graeme Mason\n\nXbox, PC\nWhile the combat mechanics are familiar, it’s South of Midnight’s evocative backdrop that marks it apart. Set in an overgrown and misty American deep south, it stars Hazel, a young woman thrust into the aftermath of a hurricane and forced to battle the evil manifestations of deep-rooted sorrows. Beautiful and engaging, its soundtrack is also wonderful, perfectly complementing the uncanny scenery. GM\n\nPC\nYour task is simple in the brilliantly silly Skin Deep: save a bunch of talking cats from marauding space pirates. The execution is anything but as you crouch in vents, pull glass from your feet, and deploy sneezing powder and slippery soap bars to incapacitate your foes. Like Metal Gear Solid meets a Looney Tunes cartoon, the pleasure here lies in pushing the game’s miniature sandboxes to their slapstick limit. Lewis Gordon\n\nPS5, PC\nCasting you as a knight with a hoverboard, Sword of the Sea is a mystical journey through a desert which roils like an ocean. You pull grab tricks and get big air on cresting dunes, but the greater enjoyment stems from simply soaking up the game’s breathtaking, nature-infused landscapes at high speed. A gorgeously dreamy, new age take on extreme sport. LG\n\nPC\nIf ancestry.com has yet to reveal your hidden royal lineage, try digging into the Roottree clan instead. Armed with a 1998 web browser, you have to deduce the loves, losses and lies of a sprawling candy dynasty (no relation to Rowntree). A compelling blend of Her Story and Who Do You Think You Are? Matthew Castle\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nShakespearean dialogue, bruising boss battles and a tale steeped in class struggle make this a refreshingly different Final Fantasy. As you command a troupe of society’s most downtrodden, excellent voice acting lends this once silent PlayStation 1 game new life. As rewarding to play as it is affecting, in 2025, Yasumi Matsuno’s tale of inequality and division has never felt more relevant. Tom Regan\n\nPS4/5, Switch, PC\nCombining the best parts of Hades with the immediacy of Streets of Rage, this colourful co-operative caper is an endless delight. As you roam Talamh’s lived-in fantasy world, this roguelike rewards you with satisfying new powers and beguiling side quests. With precise combat and varied movesets, Absolum adds some much-needed depth to the oft shallow beat ’em up genre. A co-op classic. TR\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nIf the prospect of a disgraced mobster tooling around small-town Japan accompanied by a giant depraved thumb doesn’t intrigue you, keep moving. But give Promise Mascot Agency some time and you’ll discover this compact open-world adventure is filled with chaotic charm. At its heart it’s a story of redemption, as you manage a gang of weirdo mascots and restore a dilapidated community, all while driving the best pickup truck in any video game. Christian Donlan\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nHere’s a fantasy role-playing game that’s happy to embrace elemental powers, even if it leads to pinwheeling chaos. In a world where fire attacks can spread uncontrollably and ice can lead to giant dragons dropping out of the sky as their wings freeze up, this colourful piece of whimsy offers fun that genuinely scales to your own imagination. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nMatt Newell’s hymn to photography is also a gorgeous investigation into the creative power of solitude and of paying attention to your surroundings. Learn your way around a beautifully simulated digital camera, but also explore the visual potential of a range of exquisitely crafted 3D landscapes. There are no puzzles and not much in the way of scoring, just you and your ever-developing eye. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nA football game that’s closer to the likes of Rocket League than it is Fifa, Rematch has you feeling as if you’re playing an actual match of five-a-side: developer Sloclap have utterly mastered the sensation and pace of charging up a field and passing between your mates before knocking the ball into the back of the net. Daniella Lucas\n\nPS5, PC\nProof that love and hate can be two sides of the same coin, this ridiculous adventure has you taking control of a grown man in a onesie trying to remember how to walk. You have to separately control each of your legs over a series of obstacles that lead to some absurdly funny moments, but equally has you kneeling in despair as you fall, yet again, off a wooden plank while trying to get a stupid hat. Worth it though. DL\n\nSwitch, PC\nA game all about slowing life down, While Waiting takes mundane situations – from breaking down in your car to waiting for a delayed train – and gives you multiple choices on how to handle them. Due to the way it rewards experimentation, and squeezing the fun out of everyday moments, While Waiting has taught me how to be more patient – and that wasting time by fiddling around with things is the key to a healthy life-balance. Thomas Hobbs\n\nSwitch, PC\nOne for the Halloween-loving girlies and ghoulies, this companion to Strange Horticulture has you dealing in occult objects rather than plants. Explore gothic Cumbrian locales to find artefacts, identify them via vague tomes, solve puzzles and occasionally divert the plot by giving a customer something other than what they wanted. Jordan Erica Webber\n\nSwitch, PC\nDeveloper Wadjet Eye keeps the point-and-click adventure genre alive in an apt tale of time-travelling tourism. As punters pay to revisit lost loves and settle scores, it’s your job to protect the timeline. From a timeloop farce to an urgent visit to pre-9/11 New York, Old Skies unfolds like a short story anthology. A surprise on every page. MC\n\nSwitch, PC, iOS, Android\nSudoku meets speed dating. This charming puzzle game sees you play matchmaker via seating plans, seating cute little characters together based on their hilarious pet peeves and preferences in a host of fun settings. Its puzzles are cosy, relaxing and never frustrating. Bex April May\n\nPC\nWhat if your friendly neighbourhood turned into a waking nightmare? That’s the premise of this RPG-style survival horror set in an apartment complex where unspeakable horrors are going on right outside your window – but whatever you do, you mustn’t look at them, or you risk mutating like your poor, revolting neighbours. Best enjoyed with the curtains drawn. BAM\n\nPS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nFrom its tongue-in-cheek writing to its ridiculous creatures, Toby Fox’s episodic role-playing game is charming and witty. Like Undertale before it, Deltarune flips the genre on its head with humour and heart, leaving you itching for more. (The game’s next chapter isn’t until the second half of 2026 at the earliest.) We dare you not to crack a smile at this one. Vic Hood\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nThis psychological horror immediately tells you what to expect: “This is a story about death.” As Sam, you attempt to escape your home, an increasingly twisted labyrinth of puzzles and memories. Channelling the unsettling atmosphere of Hideo Kojima’s PT, Luto delivers a powerful message about grief and life after loss. VH\n\nPS5, Switch, PC\nYou play as a fly in Time Flies, buzzing around different environments – a home or a museum, for instance – doing fly things, such as tickling people’s feet or avoiding lightbulbs. The time you have to complete the fly’s bucket list depends on your actual location, leaving just minutes or seconds to get everything done. Who knew speedrunning a fly’s life could be so delightful? Nicole Carpenter\n\nSwitch, PC\nAnd Roger is disorienting, devastating and one of the most emotional games to be released this year. From developer TearyHand Studio, And Roger’s evocative story and simple-yet-distinct art is reminiscent of Mountains’ 2018 release Florence. Within three chapters, a mystery unfolds: Who is this man in the house? Where’s my father? The answers reveal a tragic, beautiful story of love and family. NC\n\nXbox, PC\nSoft Not Weak’s Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To is a visual novel, dating simulator, and match-three game all in one. While it’s driven by its classic puzzle gameplay,this is a masterclass in characters and character design: Each individual you meetis just as interesting and well-developed as the last. It’s a must-play for both puzzle fanatics and visual novel lovers. NC",

    "fullText": "PC, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox; Bitmap Bureau/Reef Entertainment\nArcade specialists Bitmap Bureau ply their craft in this retro remake of James Cameron’s action film. But Terminator 2D is at its strongest when colouring outside the director’s lines\n\nLike Arnie’s pulverised cyborg at the end of T2, the Terminator franchise has lumbered on long past the point of being properly functional. Every film since Judgment Day has been a disappointment or an outright disaster, and its video game spinoffs haven’t fared much better. While some half-decent ones have emerged, such as 2019’s Terminator: Resistance, there hasn’t been a great Terminator game in about 30 years.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense for Terminator 2D: No Fate to attempt to fix our broken future by travelling back to the past. Developer Bitmap Bureau appeals to the series’ heyday by retelling the story of Judgment Day through a medley of retro 80s and 90s playstyles. The result is a charming and frequently thrilling action throwback, though ironically it is at its strongest when it strays furthest from James Cameron’s film.\n\nTerminator 2D begins several years before the events of the film, charting Sarah Connor’s doomed attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne systems before her incarceration at Pescadero Hospital. These early levels, which see Sarah running and gunning her way through a gang of outlaws, police, and hazmat-wearing researchers, are among the game’s best. Bitmap Bureau does a remarkable job capturing Linda Hamilton’s gritty performance in a handful of pixels, while the scenarios eke impressive variety from simple arcade fundamentals.\n\nThe momentum carries on into the future, where you spend a couple of levels fighting the armies of Skynet as adult John Connor in nuclear-blasted LA. Terminator 2D ramps up the spectacle here, with laser weapons and incendiary grenades deployed against Chrome-plated T-800s and several enormous mini-bosses. The section culminates in a thrilling boss fight against a flying Hunter-Killer drone, at which Bitmap Bureau throws all the fireworks its 16-bit aesthetic allows.\n\nNo Fate loses some of its thrust once it catches up with Judgment Day. The midsection replicates key scenes from the film in playable form, such as the chase sequences that bookend the story. But these feel overly constrained by the game’s self-imposed limitations and aren’t very exciting to play. Better served are Arnie’s bar-fight scene and Sarah Connor’s escape from Pescadero, which employ beat ’em up principles and stealth respectively. While stylish and capably designed, these ideas deserve more room to breathe.\n\nT2D regains its earlier verve in its concluding levels, though the story reaches its denouement quicker than the actual film. Fortunately, as is always the case in Terminator, the end is not really the end. Like its arcade forebears, No Fate places heavy emphasis on replay value. Not only do its harder modes challenge you with adjusted enemy placements, completing the story mode unlocks new pathways that explore alternate futures hinging on Sarah’s choices.\n\nWhile No Fate doesn’t move the needle for Terminator games as much as I’d like, it succeeds in resetting the clock for the series’ interactive arm. It’s a pointed reminder that Terminator has gaming greatness within it.\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate is out now; £24.99",

    "fullText": "on December 19, 2025 at 11:47AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThis may seem unimaginable for gamers of a certain age, but once upon a time, the best and most reliable way to try out a game before it launched was by going directly to an Electronics Boutique, a KB Toys, or any major department store with an electronics department, and playing it on a kiosk. And as a gamer of that certain age, this was exactly how I played Super Nintendo and Game Boy games for years, long before my mother could afford to buy us either (during the console wars, we were staunchly in the Sega camp). It was perfect. We would go to Sears, mom would go buy her clothes and various things for the house, and I and/or my best friend would hang out and play Mario Land, Mario World, or Donkey Kong Country for an hour at a mostly empty kiosk.\n\nAnd then there was the weekend that there was a crowd. The Nintendo kiosk was gone, and in its place was something gray and alien. And there were dozens huddled around it. We got closer, and we found out why: It was a kiosk for something called a PlayStation, and the screen showed a fighting game made up of polygons moving in and around the background in 3D. And a crowd of people were beholding their first glimpse of the future.\n\nOn September 9, 1995, the original PlayStation was released in North America, and a new era of gaming had finally begun. But for many folks at the time, that new era had a herald. The hardcore folks who preordered the PS1 got the fancier disc with the T-Rex tech demo, but much of the general public got their first taste of the PS1 with the PlayStation Picks disc, which came bundled with the console at launch and was playing non-stop on kiosks across America. These were the games and demo videos meant to sell the PS1 to the unconverted, the ambassadors Sony would send to show the world pixels were on notice, polygons were the way forward.\n\nWhat's fascinating now, though, is looking at that roster of games and comparing it to the games people call out in 2025 as the games that defined the era, at least in the way early-adopter killer-app titles like the original Super Mario Bros did for the NES, Altered Beast and Revenge of Shinobi did for the Genesis, or Mario World and F-Zero did for the SNES. While the PlayStation all-stars (no, not those ones) on that disc are easy to account for (Twisted Metal, Tekken, Wipeout, Air Combat), there are 12 games represented on that disc--eight preview videos, and four playable demos--and not all of them are as widely remembered as, say, Tekken or Ridge Racer. So, what exactly happened to the PlayStation class of 1995? Some went on to be all-time classics, while others, not so much. Let's go through them, one by one, and find out.\n\nESPN Extreme walked--er, well, biked and luged, really--so that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater could run. Right as \"extreme sports\" was becoming a thing culturally, PlayStation were right there at the forefront with the first game making a solemn attempt to tap in. ESPN Extreme itself owes a lot to EA's Road Rash far as mechanics go--racing but being able to whack people off their vehicles. But where Road Rash was still beholden to leathery biker aesthetics (though the 3DO/Sega CD ports did inject grunge back into the mix), throwing roller blading, mountain biking, and street luges in with a punkier soundtrack got it closer to the zeitgeist. That official ESPN X-Games license only helped in that regard.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: After the ESPN license dropped, Sony churned out two more sequels under the names 2Xtreme and 3Xtreme (with the original even getting re-released as 1Xtreme) with more tracks, stages, and official partnership with real-life athletes. Once that third game hit, though, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater basically carried the extreme sports standard forward, and that was that.\n\nAs for the devs, Sony Interactive Studios was, essentially, one of Sony's A-teams in the early days of the PlayStation, either directly developing or helping produce some of the biggest hits of the early days. They'd eventually splinter off and operate as 989 Studios for a while, and while most of their output wound up being Sony's first-party sports titles, their name is on some serious heavy hitters. A couple of those will be showing up later in this list, but a few others include the first two Syphon Filters, JetMoto, and even the first Everquest. They also made Spawn: The Eternal. (We forgive them.) The studio was eventually folded back into being Sony Interactive again in 2005.\n\nJumping Flash is one of the true unsung heroes of the 32-bit era. Folks love to argue about which of the big groundbreaking 3D platformers was best between Nights: Into Dreams, Crash Bandicoot, and Mario 64, but Jumping Flash was first, and while graphically threadbare, it's still best in a few areas. There's nothing terribly special about the plot: An evil real estate mogul named Baron Aloha who looks like a Funko Pop of Ted Turner steals chunks from a planet to develop as exclusive property for himself, and a space council sends a giant, adorable robot rabbit named Robbit to save the world. The core gameplay is little more than a simple collect-a-thon, and yet, that collection is dependent on Robbit making death-defying jumps across wide-open stages, all while using FPS mechanics to take down anything in his way with lasers and fireworks.\n\nMechanically, it plays less like a Mario 64, and more like Baby's First Metroid Prime. Aside from the lack of dual analog stick controls (it was 1995, after all), it's doing so many things other developers wouldn't figure out about running and jumping in 3D for years. The cherry on top is one of the finest soundtracks the PS1 had to offer, which is saying a lot. Spoiler alert, but arguably, this is the title that's held up the best from the PS1's entire launch library, and yet, it's right down there with Philosoma and Kileak as the titles we talk about the least.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Jumping Flash was at least successful enough to warrant a couple of sequels: the equally-as-good Jumping Flash 2 and Robbit Mon Dieu, which never even got a Western release.. According to former Sony Interactive president Shuhei Yoshida, the team behind PS2 launch title Fantavision once tried to grab the license for some sort of PSVR remake of the game, but the project simply fell through. The series has been dead in the water ever since. Though, shout outs to Team Asobi for giving poor, neglected Robbit some love with prominent cameos in Astro's Playroom and 2024's Astro Bot, even putting some extra respect on his name by labeling his VIP Bot in the latter \"A true 3D platforming pioneer.\"\n\nEven though Virtua Fighter had existed for about a year prior to the PlayStation, that series, to this day, has just never caught on in the West the way it's damn near an institution in Japan, at a time when the much flashier Street Fighters and Mortal Kombats ruled arcades. As such, Toshinden very quickly became the de facto ambassador for 3D fighters for quite a lot of folks, and as a first look at 3D graphics in early 1995, it was, for a time, breathtaking. Sure, it almost immediately began to age like a fine milk the second people got their hands on Tekken, but hey, it was also a snazzy, fluid (for the time), stylish 3D weapon-based fighting game with an eclectic roster, at a time when there wouldn't be any legitimate competition in that sphere until Bushido Blade and Soul Edge two years later.\n\nFor a hot second, it even felt like whip-wielding Russian dominatrix Sophia might actually be the game's breakout star. Oh, but nooo, that scene-stealing tramp Lara Croft had to come along a year later and blow up her spot. In 2025, it's a sluggish mess to play, though, still gotta hand it to ‘em that final boss Sho's stage--taking place in front of an ominous Tower of Babel while Bach's Toccata and Fugue plays during a wind storm--is a pure aura farm if ever there was.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Oh, Takara/Tamsoft tried so very hard to milk Toshinden for all it was worth before its 15 minutes were up. The original game got a Remix version on Saturn, and a shockingly great Game Boy port. There were three progressively worse sequels. There was even an anime OVA directed by Masami Obari of Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture fame. But as mentioned, Tekken, Soul Blade, even Virtua Fighter all had juice that Toshinden just didn't, and after those four sequels failed to win any additional hearts and minds, the series has been effectively dead since 1999, and nobody's really clamoring for a comeback.\n\nThe original Wipeout gets a lot right, really. There were lightning fast futuristic racing games before this, but by and large, the future they envisioned looks more like The Jetsons. Wipeout, on the other hand, looked and sounded like the inside of a London rave, 200 years from now, and that phenomenal art direction gave it an older, edgier fanbase than just about anything else on the system at launch. The vibes were absolutely immaculate. The actual game, on the other hand…well, it was fast, certainly, but it was just far too easy in that original game to scrape a wall and have all your momentum grind to a halt, in a way that made it way more unsatisfying than it should've been. These are problems that would be eradicated a year later, when Psygnosis dropped the utterly flawless Wipeout XL, a game so influential it basically kicked the door down for hardcore EDM to become a mainstream genre in the late 90s.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Like EDM itself, Wipeout was never a blockbuster franchise, but the fans who stuck with it remained loyal as hell over the subsequent 30 years. There would be a new title on every PlayStation platform (as well as a just-okay N64 version nobody talks about), each one pushing the envelope of speed to the maximum limit of the hardware. And it would remain like this until Psygnosis--then having changed names to Studio Liverpool--was restructured in 2010, then fully shut down in 2012. The series would, at least, get something of an Irish funeral in 2017 with much of the original team contributing to Wipeout Omega Collection, which remastered tracks from Wipeout HD, Fury, and 2048 into 4K/60fps. But the real kicker was a patch in 2018 which added PSVR support. The game went from being a nice, polished package for the PS4, to one of the most breathtaking, adrenaline-spiking experiences you can have in any VR headset.\n\n….so naturally, the PSVR2 is incompatible with original PSVR titles, and they still haven't given Wipeout a new port, and just what are we even doing with that headset, Sony.\n\nOut of the launch lineup, Destruction Derby is the title that feels the most redundant. Not that it's a bad game, per se. For the time, it was actually one of the more technically impressive titles in the lineup, with the car destruction physics being surprisingly detailed in particular, as well as the fact that you could have almost two dozen cars on the road at one time. Thing is, if you wanted to drive around blowing up cars, Twisted Metal came out a week before this did. If you wanted a straight driving experience, Ridge Racer launched with the console. If you just plain wanted an alternative racing game, Wipeout and ESPN Extreme were there. That didn't stop the game from being a success, but it definitely limited how much of a tail the thing would have after launch.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: The immediate sequel, Destruction Derby 2, was a pretty big improvement, leaning harder into the more southern fried, thrashy chaos vibes demolition derbies have in the U.S. The N64 version was even better still, taking some of the sluggish racing sim controls out of the equation. Real talk, I didn't even realize there was a fourth game on PS1, Destruction Derby Raw, until writing this article. That apparently released in 2000, a month before the PS2 came out, and a general look at the critical reception shows that nobody missed a whole lot. The last game in the series, Destruction Derby Arenas, would release on PS2 in 2004, only notable for being one of the few, proud PS2 games you could play online, but it was completely immemorable otherwise, and Burnout 3: Takedown would eat its lunch in every single aspect later that year.\n\nIn the same way that Tekken would be the PlayStation's answer to Sega's Virtua Fighter, Ridge Racer was their answer to Virtua Racing and Daytona USA. Ridge Racer was faster, cooler, and just saying, one of these games let you play Galaga while the game loaded. Daytona may have had the banger theme song, but the counterpoint is the little secret that because Ridge Racer loaded the entire game while you actually played Galaga, once the game loaded, you could take the disc out, and put in any CD you wanted. If you weren't zooming around tracks to the Mortal Kombat soundtrack in ‘95, you missed a golden opportunity. The point being, while Ridge Racer was a bit basic, the little things added up, and if you just wanted a straightforward racer for PS1, this was an easy, no-brainer purchase.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: You'd think, looking at the series timeline, that Namco had basically put out a new Ridge Racer every six months until about 2012, but in reality, a lot of what passes for new releases in Ridge Racer are the types of updates that would basically be free downloadable content nowadays. The major releases that mattered would be the excellent Ridge Racer Type 4, Ridge Racer V (a PS2 launch title), Ridge Racer on PSP, and Ridge Racer 6 (a 360 launch title). Those are the ones actually pushing the series forward, adding new features, and changing the mechanical focus (from arcade driving to drifting, mostly).\n\nThe others are generally various forms of remixes and riffs on those four. As mentioned, Bandai Namco has largely pumped the brakes on the series since around 2012, with the last release being a mobile title called Draw & Drift in 2016. Still, as long as there's still somebody out there simping over Reiko Nagase, the series will never truly die.\n\nWell we can keep this one brief. If all of these games represent a high school graduating class, Tekken is the class president who went on to become a Hollywood director. No other game on the disk has maintained the staying power or popularity Tekken has. If anything, it's just astonishing just how fast we went from the relatively timid Battle Arena Toshinden to the hard-hitting Tekken within two months, and the two-hit combo of Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 3 would take the whole 3D fighter genre into lightspeed not even a year later. Namco evolved this formula so fast in such a short period, and while the moves would get flashier, and Kazuya Mishima would get tossed into bigger and bigger volcanoes, the foundation of everything Tekken would become was already there in 1995.\n\nWhere Are They Now?:As of the time of writing, the Tekken series as a whole has sold over 60 million copies, 2024's Tekken 8 has sold about 4 million copies, and it's Bandai Namco's best selling franchise by a wide margin (though the fact that Elden Ring is #2 at 40 million copies sold between only two games in the series is bananas).\n\nSo, yeah, they're doing fair-to-middlin'.\n\nIf Tekken was the class president of that first demo disc class, Air Combat gets the \"Most Likely To Succeed\" trophy. The first title in the series isn't even a particularly great game--great soundtrack aside, it's sparse and bland much of the time, at a time when your average arcade had the likes of G-LOC and After Burner. But the foundation of a great game is in there, and Namco would just keep building on that foundation slowly but steadily over the years, delivering consistently on a premise that, weirdly, you don't really see much of outside this series. But they had to start somewhere, and the original Air Combat is more of an academic curiosity nowadays than a graphical showcase.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Bandai Namco has basically dropped a new Ace Combat every 2-3 years since 1995, and aside from the free-to-play experiment we don't talk about anymore, you can pick up any of them past the first, and be in for a solid time flying the unfriendly skies. The eighth installment was formally announced at the 2025 Game Awards, and it was genuinely one of the highlights of the night.\n\nFor some reason, Sony decided that they needed two vehicular combat games during their launch window, and for some reason didn't immediately decide to just run with the one with the evil ice cream truck in it. To be fair, the first Twisted Metal doesn't go nearly as buck wild with its roster and features as the subsequent games would outside of old Sweet Tooth, but the game's edgelord attitude still made it stand out, and the addition of guns and bombs to the mix makes it a little more freewheeling than Destruction Derby was. It's not the best the series would have to offer, but there's plenty of what the series would become right there from the start.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: As a game series, Twisted Metal has had kind of a rough time of it. Twisted Metal 2 is a stone-cold classic, while the series just kinda spins its wheels for 3 and 4. Twisted Metal: Black was a grim(m) and gritty triumph that got the series back on track, only for Sony to put the series on ice for another four years. Twisted Metal: Head-On on PSP is mediocre on its own, though it did get a director's cut of sorts on PS2 that offered way more bang for the buck. The franchise goes back to sleep again until 2012, and a pretty great PS3 reboot.\n\nIt's now been 13 years, and if one were to hazard a guess what the hold up is, the, uh… well,let's usethe word\"colorful\"... reputation of series creator David Jaffe in the industry probably has something to do with why Sony hasn't decided to give the property another shot as a game. Instead, all the focus is now on the small screen, with Twisted Metal getting a live-action TV show adaptation on Peacock, and stunning everybody by actually being really, really fun, enough to get renewed for a third season, in fact.\n\nWhat's really striking as this list goes is just how many studios pulled double duty with the PS1's launch, putting two games out, and trying to suss out what actually sticks. The other thing is how many of these games end up cannibalized by the others in the same genre. In this case, despite being a better, more dynamic aerial combat title than Air Combat, and the tongue-in-cheek tone granting it a grim charm, Warhawk is kind of a distant memory. While yes, we can maybe blame Twisted Metal for pulling SingleTrac's focus away from The Little VTOL That Could, there were enough hard hitting, pulse pounding dog fights going on here to warrant more than being largely forsaken mere months after launch.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: The game wasn't completely forgotten, in fairness. Sony did put out a pretty decent and successful multiplayer-only reboot in 2007, which holds the distinction of being the first physical game to ever get a digital release on the PlayStation Network. That, in turn, got a sci-fi spinoff called Starhawk which was also rock solid, though after so many complaints about Warhawk ‘07 being multiplayer-only, Starhawk got a single-player campaign that feels like a monkey's paw curling on those complaints.\n\nEven compared to Jumping Flash, Philosoma is the genuine buried treasure of that first demo disc. At the time of its release, it was torn apart by critics for not being next-gen enough. It's not hard to see why, really. Philosoma is, essentially, a Whitman's Sampler of every single type of scrolling space shooter ever made up to that point. One stage will scroll left to right. The next will shift to a behind-the-ship POV. The next may take an isometric Zaxxon angle. While they're all well done, and the array of weapon variants is a highlight, in 1995, scrolling shooters were the epitome of a played-out genre. It'd be the equivalent of putting out a new hero shooter now. In 2025, a cool, straightforward space shooter would be a pretty welcome sight by itself. But it wouldn't be the decent gameplay that would make Philosoma stand out.\n\nSee, the story is that you play a pilot sent down to a colonized planet with a squadron led by a tactical AI, after the colonists put out a distress call. The planet seems deserted, but there's a whole lot of insectoid creatures running around, many of which seem to have infected the colonists' technology. As your crew starts scouring the planet for the colonists, one by one, the team's AI starts pulling a HAL 9000 on your teammates, while still leading you deeper into the planet's core. Eventually you find the colonists: liquified and strung up from the ceiling in a massive insect's hive like something out of a Junji Ito book. And you find out that not only is the planet alive, but your ship has been commandeered to fertilize the planet so the alien life form at the core can be born. It is DEEPLY horrifying, but easily one of the most memorable space shooters of the generation because of it. At least, for the maybe dozens of folks who actually played it.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: So, weird enough, Philosoma does technically have a sequel: a survival horror/visual novel game on PS2 called Phase Paradox that never saw Western shores. Funny enough, despite never making it out of Japan, it's fully voiced in English. It's not great, but it does in fact pick up where Philosoma left off, and it's honestly rather ambitious for the time, kind of a proto-David Cage game mixed with Parasite Eve.\n\nAs for the developers, they'd go on to do far less horrifying projects after. Two years later, G-Artists would be responsible for the extremely fun Intelligent Qube. Ten years later, the game's composer, Kow Otani, would go on to score Shadow of the Colossus. One of the folks who worked on visual effects for Phase Paradox is some dude named Yoko Taro. Wonder if he ever went on to do anything. Anyway, safe to say, a third go-around for this universe isn't in the cards. But what a ride.\n\nLast and most definitely least. FPS titles were still a pretty new genre in ‘95, especially on consoles, which makes it miraculous Jumping Flash got so much right. But even with that grace afforded, Kileak being miles and miles of copy/pasted hallways with the occasional robot to break things up is just the absolute worst, and the reward being a dozen or so audio logs from a mad scientist who thinks he found \"the real Adam\" isn't nearly enough to keep going. If you hated Ridley Scott's Prometheus, now imagine it was rendered on a PS1, but also they couldn't afford Michael Fassbender, so they hired a malfunctioning Disneyland robot from the Hall of Presidents. That's the level of production value you're working with here. Unsurprisingly, the video that comes on the demo disc shows none of that, just the cool CG cutscenes of mechs arriving at the South Pole to take down a mad scientist, with a techno song bumping over it.\n\nWhere Are They Now?: Somehow, Kileak also got a sequel, called Epidemic (it goes by the far more ostentatious Kileak: The Blood 2: Reason in Madness in Japan) a year later. The big improvement is that now the hallways have texture. The emptiness problem is still very much in place, the acting is still abysmal, the shooting is still uninspiring. By the time it released, Doom, Hexen, and Alien Trilogy would all be on PS1. There is no excuse for an empty FPS map at this point. The developers, Genki, would go on to have a very long career pumping out consistent 6/10 games, but the only familiar names on their resume for Westerners would be the Tokyo Xtreme Racer games on Dreamcast/PS2, and, oddly enough, Katamari Forever on PS3, which was largely made of remixed stages from the previous games. Still, it netted them the best review scores of their career with near-universal 7s. Yay progress?",

Sony got the ball rolling with the PlayStation Wrap-Up, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?\nWhile it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025.

From this simple premise comes a joyful game of mindfulness and social interaction, as Alta learns how to serve up witty conversation and decent hot drinks. Colourful and highly stylised, it is a thoughtful study of burnout and recovery.\n\nInkle/Nintendo Switch, iPhone/iPad, Mac, PC\nAn attempted-murder mystery set in an a 1920s all-girls private school reveals itself to also be an eviscerating takedown of British class politics. Witty and beautifully drawn, it is full of amusing boarding-school stereotypes, from self-interested prefects to a terrifying matron, whose motivations and personal grievances must be slowly unpicked. It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.\n\nSupergiant Games, PC, Switch\n\n A stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.\n\nSokpop Collectiv, PC\n\n A gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.\n\nMegagon Industries, PC, Xbox\n\n All is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.\n\nCapcom, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n Capcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.\n\nHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Two aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.\n\n11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n After crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.\n\nPanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Set at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.\n\nTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n The Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.\n\nSucker Punch/Sony, PS5\n\n A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing the shamisen or wielding a sumi-e ink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.\n\nKojima Productions/Sony, PS5\n\n Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.\n\nSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n An extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.\n\nHexecutable, PC \n\n A satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funny and has a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.\n\nSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PC\n\n It’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.\n\nNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n In 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.\n\nTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n Even the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.\n\nDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n A young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.",

    "title": "Tomb Raider Remake Will Be Easier To Cater For \"Modern Player Tastes\"",
    "description": "Crystal Dynamics announced Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis last week at The Game Awards, calling it a reimagining of the original 1996 Tomb Raider. While the studio wants to stay faithful to the original, it has also said it plans to tone down the brutal difficulty of the nearly 30-year-old PlayStation 1 game.\nSpeaking in a press conference, as reported by GamesRadar, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked about adapting the original PS1 game specifically when it comes to difficulty. Like many games of its era, the 1996 game was known to have its punishingly difficult sections, including insta-kill death traps that were often near-impossible to avoid without the benefit of hindsight.\n\"Part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes,\" Kerslake said, and though he doesn't explicitly mention difficulty it seems safe to say that Legacy of Atlantis will have far fewer insta-kills.",

    "fullText": "How can you possibly squeeze a 32-bit PlayStation CD ROM game into a small Game Boy Color Cartridge? Well, HotGen would attempt to do just that with a conversion of Resident Evil in mid-1999 and to make it as close as possible with similar 3D perspectives using scaled sprites.\n\nThere were delays and a lot of struggles to cram everything in. There were of course a number of restrictions and tweaks made along the way, but HotGen had a pretty decent stab at it and had a title which was certainly pushing the 8-bit hardware.\n\nRetained were the original game’s locations, viewpoints, puzzles, pre-rendered backgrounds and dialogue. Characters and enemies were software-scaled, with technical compromises required due to the GBC’s limited CPU power and storage. Speech was replaced with text windows, but the structure of the PlayStation original remained largely intact.\n\nWhen we spoke to developer Nigel Speight as part of our book coverage in 2020, he had the following recollections about the development:\n\n“If I remember correctly I would say the game was about 75-85% complete. Originally the game was supposed to be about 35% of the original PlayStation version and we were going to elongate the storyline to keep reusing the rooms. However, as time went along Virgin kept upping the cartridge size and wanting more of the original content in. If I remember correctly I’d created an editor that allowed the 3d to be aligned to the screens and objects placed etc and I think that the last build we made didn’t include the final amount of content me and the artist Martin Smith had created.”\n\nThe game had been shown at places like E3 in 1999, and had been planned for release by the Christmas of that year – though delays meant it slipped into early 2000. By February 2000, the game was nearing completion and was being tested. However, Capcom decided to cancel the title, feeling that the game wasn’t up to scratch.\n\nAssistant programmer Pete Frith (back in 2020 when questioned by us) couldn’t recall the completion state, but felt it was more 98% finished, as there was a lot of communications between the team and QA testers at the end. He also recalls that the story they were told regarding the cancellation, was that the original creator of Resident Evil didn’t feel the GBC was worthy of his creation, and that he had personally instructed the cancellation. He also informed that the lead artist Martin Smith had sadly passed away.\n\nWhere Martin focused on the backgrounds, Simon Butler did the sprite work on the game. Mark Cooksey was then on hand to create all the music and sound effects, though many would not get properly integrated it seems.\n\nThankfully, in 2011 – two separate builds were preserved thanks to Kiff Storey and Bowker. One version was quite near to completion, but was missing intro titles and had debug screens on and was felt to be around 90% complete. A long-play online confirmed that the game wasn’t completable either for both characters.\n\nIn late 2025 however, Games That Weren’t have now preserved a final version of game at the point of cancellation and we have it here for you today to check out thanks to Pete Frith providing everything. Again, it isn’t 100% complete (perhaps now 98% – based on Pete’s estimates) – but there is more content and it *might* actually now be completable. Due to time constraints, we’ve not been able to sit and play through the title fully to confirm, as there might be scenes that glitch/bug out – if you find that it is, please do let us know!\n\nCrucially, we know that the Tyrant seems to be present at the end (see below) and its possible to trigger the end sequence compared to the earlier builds. We have a hack further below that jumps you near the end, so that you can see this for yourself.\n\nThe debug data present in other builds has been removed in the final build, and there are a set of introduction credit screens present in this version. Also, hacking through the game – the end sequences are in place too, which gives promise that the game may be completable in its current final state. Just in case it isn’t, we’ve created a few hacks which allow the following to unlock some unseen content:\n\n1) ResiEvilHack-EndingSelector: This allows you to just select either character and jump straight to the end sequences for both.\n\n2) ResiEvilHack-TyrantSegments: This hack jumps near towards the end of the game, where the tyrant is now walking around the final outside scene if you select Chris Redfield. If you select Jill Valentine, it starts you in the lab with the tyrant moving around (though its just their silloette).\n\nYou can’t seem to kill the Tyrant with the knife with Chris (though you might be able to find a weapon nearby). However, if you play with Jill and navigate towards the outside helicopter pad – the tyrant is there, and you can use your gun to kill them – triggering the end sequence.\n\n3) ResiEvilHack-SceneNMusicPlayer: This is quite a cool hack. Firstly, if you select either character – it will play through all the animated scenes for that player in sequence. It is likely there will be a few scenes here which were not used in the game or integrated. Then if you press “B” on the same selector screen, you will be able to play through all the SFX and pressing “SELECT” will cycle through all the tunes created by Mark Cooksey.\n\nIn a note found to the developers, Mark listed all the music and SFX as follows (with his original descriptions):\n\n0 Silence tune (Skipped in selector)\n 1 Long Background tune #1\n 2 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #1\n 3 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #2 *modified tune *\n 4 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #3 *new tune to replace old one *\n 5 Short Dramatic danger loop tune #4 * modified tune *\n 6 BG00 from res evil\n 7 Long Background tune #2\n 8 Long Background tune #3\n 9 Moonlight sonata correct\n 10 Moonlight sonata played badly correct\n 11 Long background tune #4\n 12 Girly end of game tune * new tune *\n\n0 Police card (char) select\n 1 Option move from one to another\n 2 select (highlight option)\n 3 Cancel\n 4 Wooden door open\n 5 Wooden door close\n 6 clock ticking VERSION 1 Looping\n 7 Stop clock 1 ticking\n 8 clock ticking VERSION 2 BETTER THAN 1 Lp\n 9 Stop clock 2 ticking\n 10 Footstep #1 on carpet\n 11 Single hard footstep\n 12 Double footstep #1 Gravel use together\n 13 Double footstep #2 left foot then RFoot\n 14 Long Footstep for wading through water\n 15 Gun shot #1 n\n 16 Gun shot #2\n 17 Knife swipe 1 Shorter\n 18 Knife swipe 2 Longer\n 19 Zombie Moan 1 (1 channel fx)\n 20 Zombie Moan 2 (2 channel fx more real)\n 21 Zombie Chomp (bite)\n 22 Teleprinter type sound 1 shot\n 23 Go on to next screen after pick char\n 24 Page Turn\n 25 Gun Reload 1 REVOLVER\n 26 Gun reload 2 Shotgun\n 27 Gun Reload 3 ???\n 28 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 29 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 30 Bloke Aaah being attacked.\n 31 Girl Aaah being attacked.\n 32 Push Furniture (continuous)\n 33 Stop push furniture\n 34 Bees\n 35 Break stone\n 36 Gate Noise\n 37 Lift start (loops)\n 38 Lift stop\n 39 Key open (key apar)\n 40 Power on\n 41 Computer key click\n\nIn addition to this, we have extracted out a set of assets used for the game – which may contain sprites/sequences not used in the final game. Also, the original WAV samples that Pete Frith created from his voice to make the speech on the title screen – including some versions that were not used :)\n\nWhat else have we established so far?\n\nIf you spot anything else – please feel free to get in touch or leave something in the comments and we’ll update the page over time. For now, we hope you enjoy taking a look at what has been recovered and enjoy the findings so far. We have also included two bonus builds that we also located which will have some minor differences too.\n\nWith a huge thank you to Pete Frith for allowing us to preserve and for the assets and to Nigel Speight for his recollections.",

    "description": "At The Game Awards, developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, confirming a release date of September 9, 2026 on PC and PlayStation 5.\nThe trailer was pretty epic, starting with some CGI of a martial artist crossing swords with some thugs while carrying a baby in some Death Stranding kind of way. We then cut to some actual gameplay of our protagonist, the elite assassin Soul, as he travels around various environments, enters various cutscenes, and engages in various battles. It's not quite a souls-like, but based on combat encounters and enemy designs, you'd think it was one. Actually, it looks like a cool mix between Where Winds Meet, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.",

Now that Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription service has been overhauled, you can dive into a library of PS3 classics with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. We've rounded up the best PS3 games to stream on PlayStation Plus.\n\nOur list includes games across a wide variety of genres. Some are well-known PlayStation exclusives that have been given new life on the PS5, while others are unsung gems that you may have missed out on during the PS3 era. Keep in mind that unlike other platforms in the new PS Plus library, you can only stream PlayStation 3 titles; you can't download them onto your console. That means you need a stable Wi-Fi connection or a hardwired ethernet connection (recommended) to play them.\n\nYou'll notice that our list includes several remakes and remasters from older PlayStation platforms that were added to the PS3 library. Any game that's streaming-only was eligible for this list. If you want to go further back in time, check out our list of the best classic PS1/PS2/PSP games to play with a PS Plus Premium subscription--classics and PS3 games are limited to Premium subscribers. And if you're more interested in staying in the modern era, we also have a list of the best games to play with a PlayStation Plus Extra or Premium membership. For a full look at the new PS Plus service, take a look at our roundup of every game available in the PS Plus library.\n\nAlthough it’s been somewhat overshadowed by the games that came after it, Fallout 3 was a major turning point for the franchise. This was the first 3D Fallout game, and many of the gameplay mechanics have been celebrated in its successors. Bethesda also attracted some top-notch voice talent for this one, including Liam Neeson, who voices the father of the player’s character.\n\nAfter emerging from a Vault, players get to explore the Washington D.C. area and follow the primary and side missions to enjoy up to 100 hours or \n\nNinja Theory’s Heavenly Sword felt like it was meant to be the beginning of the next great franchise. Instead, it was a one-and-done with fantastic graphics and gameplay that put players in the role of Nariko, a woman who dares to take up the Heavenly Sword to protect her family and clan even though it will slowly overtake her body and destroy her.\n\nThe combat is fluid and a hell of a lot of fun when using the sword to take a large number of enemies on-screen. There are also a few times when players control Nariko’s closest friend, Kai, who has projectile weapons that you can aim and glide towards an enemy with the turn of a controller. This game doesn’t just deserve a modern remaster, it needs a sequel.\n\nRead our Heavenly Sword review.\n\nKonami has left the Castlevania franchise on the shelf for over a decade, and the only way to revisit the reboot, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, is by diving into it on PS Plus Premium. Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima was one of the producers for this title, which reimagined the entire Castlevania mythos and gave the gameplay the 3D makeover it needed.\n\nIn this version of the story, players take control of Gabriel Belmont, a holy warrior for the Brotherhood of Light. Gabriel’s wife, Marie, has been murdered by one of the supernatural creatures he was born to fight. But because Marie’s soul is trapped, she serves as Gabriel’s guide as he takes up a quest to not only save the world, but restore his wife to life. This is a wildly underrated title, and we need more Castlevania games like this.\n\nRead our Castlevania: Lords of Shadow review.\n\nGamers of a certain age should remember Sly Cooper, the anthropomorphic raccoon and master thief who was the main character of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus on PlayStation 2. That game and its first two sequels--Sly 2: Band of Thieves and Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves--were remastered for PlayStation 3 as part of The Sly Collection, and they have withstood the test of time.\n\nThe original versions of the trilogy were developed by Sucker Punch before the studio went on to release Infamous and Ghost of Tsushima. You’ll recognize the DNA of those games by the way Sly moves on rooftops and the way he utilizes stealth to remain undetected. Now, someone just needs to pull off a heist so Sly can get the comeback he deserves.\n\nWhile Arkham Origins game may not have been helmed by Rocksteady Games, developer Warner Bros. Montreal still did an admirable job with this prequel. Featuring all the combat, stealth, and detective work you'd expect from a Batman game, this Arkham title hit all three bat-nails on the bat-heads.\n\nRead our Batman Arkham Origins review.\n\nDecades after they were first released, the Devil May Cry games--yes, even the controversial second one--still stand tall as excellent action romps. Demonic hordes, stylish combat, and a protagonist with a devil-may-care attitude are just some of the reasons why Capcom's classic trilogy deserves a revisit. We recommend playing them in order, but if time is an issue, Devil May Cry 3 holds up better than its predecessors.\n\nRead our Devil May Cry HD Collection review.\n\nA cult-classic Japanese tactics series, you can grab several Disgaea games on PS Plus and feel what it's like to deliver ridiculous numbers of damage, forge relationships, and master exotic weapons within the fantasy frame of these titles. Just the Disgaea games alone offer hundreds of hours of compelling PS3 streaming content.\n\nA technical achievement at the time, The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion's open-world design was nothing short of stunning when it first released in 2006. 16 years later, the game is still a treat, with its in-your-face swords and sorcery action, excellent voice-acting, and dark fantasy tale centered around a Daedra invasion.\n\nRead our The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion review.\n\nBefore it was developing an underrated Devil May Cry reboot or the Senua's Saga series, developer Ninja Theory was making a name for itself with Enslaved. A new take on the classic tale, Enslaved pivots from ancient China to the far future for a thrilling tale of action in a robot post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nRead our Enslaved: Odyssey to the West review.\n\nFallout 3 brought the Bethesda series into a new dimension, but Obsidian Entertainment's spin-off is arguably the most well-remembered entry in the series. The gameplay was largely the same, but the extra improvements, incredible characters, and a fascinating new region made this Fallout the gold standard of the post-apocalyptic franchise. Fallout 3 is also on PS Plus Premium, and it's still worth playing, too.\n\nRead our Fallout New Vegas review.\n\nLiving up to its name, FEAR was part first-person shooter and part psychological horror that combined to create an effective package of high-caliber thrills. Everything from the sound design to the atmospheric levels was a showcase of how to give your audience multiple heart attacks, and even with several sequels, the first FEAR is still the cold standard for terror.\n\nThe original Greek adventures that set a new benchmark for games with brutal combat and quick-time events, the first two God of War games are fascinating throwbacks to the past that introduced the world to Kratos and his undying rage. The HD versions of these PS2 classics are still a treat to play in 2022.\n\nWhile there certainly wasn't a shortage of official PGA games during the PS3 era, but Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational was easily the best arcade golf game on the console. Originally released on the PS Vita, this port spruced up the product and made it feel even better with PS Move features that put you right in the game. Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds is also available to stream on PS Plus, so if you get bored of the courses in World Invitational, there's plenty more golfing fun to be had in Out of Bounds.\n\nRead our Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational review.\n\nIn an era where the PS2 was home to a regular influx of hit games, Ico stood out from the pack with its more tranquil puzzle gameplay and novel storytelling methods. Fast-forward a few years into the future, and an HD remaster brought all of that magic back in a new light.\n\nBefore it was developing an incredible samurai sandbox in Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch was known as the Infamous studio for good reason. An absolute power fantasy trip with fascinating consequences depending on your morality, the Infamous games still make for electrifying entertainment.\n\nReleased at a time when Mega Man had been absent from home consoles for years, the ninth and tenth installments in the series showed that the Blue Bomber hadn't lost his charm during his hiatus. Challenging and colorful, these Mega Man games were some of the best that the franchise had to offer. They captured the nostalgia of early Mega Man games by replicating the pixelated visuals while taking advantage of modern advancements in technology.\n\nThe fourth time was the charm for the Motorstorm series, as Apocalypse upped the ante with its rich selection of vehicles, well-designed tracks, and destructible environments that made each race a nail-biting sprint across hostile terrain.\n\nRead our Motorstorm: Apocalypse review.\n\nShinobi style cranked up to the maximum, Ryu Hayabusa's PS3 adventures were nothing short of effortlessly cool action mixed with devastating difficult gameplay. The Sigma games are harder than a freshly forged kunai, but they're still rewarding to play.\n\nRead our Ninja Gaiden Sigma review.\n\nVisually striking, PixelJunk Eden's Encore edition is a strange but fascinating game of platforming mixed with gardening. Sometimes serene, sometimes intense when the timer starts counting down; the lush visuals, distinct score, and surreal maneuverability makes for an unforgettable game.\n\nRead our PixelJunk Eden Encore review.\n\nPuppeteering might be the creepiest form of entertainment ever devised, but in the hands of SCE Japan, it's a medium that packs charm and imagination into a package of pure charm. Throw in some wonderful platforming, epic boss battles, and a killer soundtrack, and you've got a winner right here.\n\nA great Ratchet and Clank game is pure digital comfort food, and these two titles were simply delicious to dig into. Charming, witty, and full of great level design, PS Plus has a one-two punch of nostalgic fun waiting to be experienced in this pair of games. There are a couple other Ratchet games available to stream, but this pair keeps the traditional Ratchet & Clank gameplay.\n\nRead our Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus review.\n\nTaking a detour from the Grand Theft Auto series into wild west territory, Red Dead Redemption will amaze you with its cowboy sandbox and break your heart with its story. The standalone expansion, Undead Nightmare, is also plenty of fun as it adds a zombie mode that turns the entire game upside down.\n\nRead our Red Dead Redemption review.\n\nBefore the remake arrives, dive into Resident Evil 4 and marvel at how the series underwent a massive shift in tone and style. The controls might take some getting used to, but the rest of the game puts a terrific action spin on Resident Evil's trademark undead horror.\n\nRead our Resident Evil 4 review.\n\nThe final chapter in the Resistance saga is all action, alien devastation, and peak FPS fun from its era. Toss in some stomach-churning terror and a story that constantly increases in tension, and you'll be on the edge of your seat from the main menu through to the end credits.\n\nWhen Sam and Max made their return, it was nothing short of triumphant at the time. Reborn with a fancy new 3D aesthetic and 4D humor, these collections are perfect examples of hilarious storytelling and ingenious puzzles.\n\nRead our Sam and Max: Beyond Time and Space review.\n\nIf you ever wondered what would happen if Michael Bay decided to make a racing game, then Split/Second is your answer to that question. A solid arcade-style racing game, the real attention-grabber here was a selection of tracks that featured explosive turns and plenty of mayhem in every single race.\n\nThe tale of Darth Vader's secret apprentice may have been expunged from Star Wars continuity, but back then, these games were massively ambitious entries that sought to flesh out the years between the prequel and original trilogies. Living up to its name, the Force truly was unleashed in Starkiller's adventures across a galaxy far, far away.\n\nRead our Star Wars: The Force Unleashed review.\n\nStill revered as one of the most influential fighting games of all time, Street Fighter II also set a standard with several enhanced versions of the game that would be released over the years. Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is that legendary game at its best, packed with a great roster of characters, well-oiled fighting mechanics, and plenty of modern touches.\n\nRead our Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nFor a change of pace, grab a quick stream of the delightful puzzle-punching Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix. It's cute, captivating, and still plays like a dream.\n\nRead our Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nIn the mood for a dual-stick spaceship game that lets you see wonderfully colorful worlds as you turn enemy vessels into an explosive collection of pixels? Super Stardust HD has you covered with this stylish blast from the past.\n\nRead our Super Stardust HD review.\n\nPlatforming action starring a small blob might not sound too enticing, but this little gelatinous fellow combined magnetic traversal with relaxing puzzles and comfortable levels to explore. Two games, two adventures that can easily be enjoyed over a weekend.\n\nRead our Tales from Space: About a Blob review.\n\nEasily the weirdest title on this list, Tokyo Jungle is an examination of what life would be like for our beloved pets if humanity decided to just vanish off the face of the planet one day. It's a flawed gem, but one that sparkles with its absurd ideas and lively world.\n\nRevived for a new generation, Firaxis' XCOM was a welcome sight for anyone who felt that The Bureau had derailed the XCOM name. Pure tactical action and layered squad-building, this XCOM modernized the series for a new audience while keeping veterans engaged with its strategic content.\n\nRead our XCOM Enemy Within review.",

Set in ancient Baghdad, the game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq after he is recruited into the Hidden Ones and joins the fight against the Order of the Ancients.\n\nDeveloped by Team Ninja--the studio behind the Nioh games and co-developer of Ninja Gaiden 4--Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty is a fast-paced action game with parry-based combat that'll appeal to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice fans. Set during China's Three Kingdoms period of history, the game puts a dark fantasy and souls-like spin on this era of Chinese history.\n\nA day-one release, Skate Story puts you in control of a demon who makes a deal with the devil to swallow the moon. As if that didn't sound challenging enough, your demonic avatar also happens to be constructed from glass and pain, so any fumble is going to hurt really badly. Not only do you have to master your skateboard, but you also have to use it to overcome other demons, save tormented souls with your sick tricks, and discover the secrets of hell without taking a tumble.\n\nAs the captain of a skyfaring crew, you've got free rein to explore the floating archipelago of the Sky Realm in Granblue Fantasy: Relink and find the legendary island of Estalucia. That's easier said than done, as between enemy gangs and a growing plot in the background that threatens the entire Sky Realm, you'll have your work cut out for you in this fantasy game.\n\nLooking to become a theme park master? Then you'll want to grab a download of Planet Coaster 2 and start building some attention-grabbing rides. Building on the foundation set by its predecessor, Planet Coaster 2 offers more tools and resources to not only construct exciting water rides and coasters, but also the facilities to keep your park guests happy when they've got their feet firmly planted on the ground.\n\nThe Cat Quest games are delightful adventures full of terrific puns, and Cat Quest 3 doesn't disappoint. An open-world action-RPG set in a fantastical pirate-themed world known as the Purribean, the threequel sees players search for a long-lost mythical treasure and battle Pi-rats on the high seas. The game is also playable in solo or co-op modes.\n\nWe've seen Aloy's debut adventure on PS4 and remastered for PS5, but the Lego version puts a lighthearted spin on a familiar tale. Set in a world where humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain following a robot uprising, Lego Horizon Adventures follows Aloy as she sets out to prove herself and discover the lost secrets of the planet. You can hunt machines as Aloy, or you can play as her allies Varl, Teersa, and Erend in this colorful Lego game.\n\nFor the younger members of the family, you can boot up not one but two Paw Patrol games for them. The first one is a kart-racer featuring the gang, as they compete to win the Pup Cup.\n\nThe second Paw Patrol game is an action-adventure where you can play as the pups. Just like the animated series, you can drive their signature vehicles, engage in rescue missions, and explore Adventure Bay to help out citizens in need.\n\nPlayStation Plus Premium subscription required\n\nThe timeless tale of swords and souls is back, as Soulcalibur 3 joins the classics library this month. Originally released in 2005 for PS2, Soulcalibur 3 on PS5 and PS4 has been upgraded with enhanced visuals, quick-save and rewind functionality, and custom video filters.",

Microsoft Flight Simulator 24's collab with Stranger Things has arrived today on Steam, cloud, Xbox, and, despite initial pushback, PS5. The crossover is more than skins; it even features Murray Bauman (Brett Gelman) from the original cast as you help the citizens of Hawkins escape the encroaching darkness.\n\"Enter the world of Netflix’s Stranger Things to help Hawkins, a town under lockdown, heavy patrols, and supernatural threats,\" it reads on the official PlayStation Blog. \"And, if you’re ready to visit Hawkins, Indiana, even after the credits roll on the crew’s last strange adventure, you will be able to explore a highly detailed map and recreation of the town with more than 40 iconic locations made famous by the show.",

    "description": "While we're still a couple of months away from Resident Evil Requiem's release, it looks like there could be a surprise return awaiting fans. Before it was removed, the PlayStation Store revealed new cover art for the game that featured longtime Resident Evil protagonist Leon Kennedy. PlayStation 5 players noticed the art on the pre-download screen for owners of the standard (non-Deluxe) version of the game.\nIGN later confirmed the art, which showed a stubbled and haggard-looking Leon hovering over Requiem's other main protagonist, Grace Ashcroft. Leon appeared similar to his Resident Evil 4 look, with his fur-lined leather jacket, albeit a bit more grizzled.",

    "fullText": "Sam Eng/Devolver Digital, PC, PS5, Switch 2\nAn exquisitely fluid game of tricks, grinds and manuals is framed by a story that uncovers the poignancy of the infamously painful pastime\n\nSkateboarding video games live and die by their vibe. The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s beloved Skate franchise offered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.\n\nThe premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.\n\nThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.\n\nThe vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.\n\nThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.\n\nGradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.\n\nThese questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is \n\nThe result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.",

    "description": "Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a \"whole avalanche\" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann.\nHe told XDA-Developers that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5.\nThe 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud.",
