    "fullText": "In BBC Sport's Eat & Yap series, Alex Scott meets some of the best WSL players to share the food they love and to chat about life on and off the pitch.\n\nWatch the interview in full now on BBC iPlayer\n\nKerstin Casparij has been setting the pace down the flanks for league leaders Manchester City all season.\n\nOn the latest episode of Eat & Yap, while teaching Alex Scott how to create the Dutch delicacy oliebollen, she reveals how she ended up with a cat tattoo, why her girlfriend thought she was a gardener and why team-mate Vivianne Miedema causes her to swear in Dutch.\n\nAlex: OK, so talk to me, what's on the menu.\n\nKerstin: All right, so you'll see a massive pan of oil, which I know doesn't look too nice, but I've been able to prep some butter and this is for a snack called oliebollen.\n\nAlex: So this is a bit of home?\n\nKerstin: It is very Dutch and we only have them around New Year's. You can only get the packaging around New Year's as well. Don't look at the calories actually, because that's why we don't have them all year round!\n\nAlex: Some recipes had currants and raisins for this...\n\nKerstin: I don't like the raisins!\n\nAlex: We're on the same wavelength there! I'll warn you, I'm not very good at hiding things if I don't like them.\n\nKerstin: Alex, I'm Dutch. Do I look like the type that hides it?\n\nAlex: Talk to me a bit more about life at home because you grew up in what, a remote part of the Netherlands?\n\nKerstin: So I'm a northern girl. I'm from a province called the Friesland and I'm very lucky that I grew up in a small town where a lot of sports are available. Playing was like a two-minute walk from where I used to live, which was perfect.\n\nAlex: I feel like it was always definite you were going to go on and be an athlete then?\n\nKerstin: Well, my parents met both playing for the Dutch national team and they both did judo, so there was no choice other for us than to do sports.\n\nAlex: How did the people back home describe you back then?\n\nKerstin: People mostly described me as loud, very chatty - I'm raging ADHD. I've calmed down a little bit now but as a child I was all over the shop. It was such a good thing, growing up and wanting to become an athlete, because I was so hyper-focused on football.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's hard to navigate, so how did you do that?\n\nKerstin: At that time I was really struggling to keep up in school, to get ready for tests and also do all my football. Once I had the diagnosis, I was speaking to psychologists and my parents were very supportive. It takes time and I still have a lot of things to learn about myself.\n\nAlex: Would you say Manchester feels like home for you now?\n\nKerstin: Definitely. I think the people here are so nice. That's one of the things I heard when I was going to join. I live here with my girlfriend - we've got our cats.\n\nAlex: So you met your girlfriend in Manchester?\n\nKerstin: We met on Tinder in Manchester. It was great for me because I was a bit lonely, living on my own and I was just excited to meet other people outside my team-mates. I love my team-mates but sometimes you want to see other people as well.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's the part that's hard to explain. Yes, you are fully immersed in football but it's equally as important to have other hobbies.\n\nKerstin: My girlfriend always says: 'You've got such a football perspective' and also just work-life balance. It's so different than she has, working nine to five and being off at weekends. Your work is not your life, not your personality and it doesn't define who you are. Being able to see that side of it and her allowing me to step away is really nice.\n\nAlex: You said you met on Tinder?\n\nKerstin: Yeah and to be fair, I was debating whether to go on Tinder. This was at the point in my career where I wasn't that known.\n\nAlex: Did I read you didn't put any photos up on Tinder of you in football kit?\n\nKerstin: I didn't put any bio - I didn't put any pictures of football. So Ruth had no idea that I was even sporty. She thought I was a gardener because I was tanned… She had no idea about football so it was fun to introduce her to the world and now she's a massive fan. She knows all the gossip! Sometimes she comes home and she tells me these things and I'm like: 'How do you know this?'\n\nAlex: So you've got Ruth, and now two cats?\n\nKerstin: Kiwi and Mango. Both fruits. I got Kiwi because I was on my own and I was very lonely. Then I met Ruth a couple of months later and we're both away quite a lot so we thought we should get Kiwi a brother.\n\nAlex: And next level, you have a tattoo.\n\nKerstin: Yes, I've got a tattoo of them. Should I show you? I've got a tattoo of them looking into a wine glass just because they're cute and silly.\n\nAlex: Are you fully immersed in Manc life? What kind of slang words?\n\nKerstin: I kinda just copy everyone else.\n\nAlex: What about when you're back with the Dutch team?\n\nKerstin: I definitely struggle having to switch to Dutch again, like finding the words because I only speak Dutch with my mum.\n\nAlex: What are the team meetings like in Manchester City then? Is it fully English or do you have translators?\n\nKerstin: It's all English. I know some that do struggle a little bit and when they have a meeting with the coach, they do have a translator to make sure they're being heard. To be fair, team meetings are really good. Andree [Jeglertz] really made a point about it being really open. We're all in a massive circle rather than an auditorium so when you speak you can actually look directly at each other. We really work together and everybody has a voice.\n\nAlex: You do team bonding stuff?\n\nKerstin: We've made it a very big thing to have a lot of team activities this year. So I'm captain of the team activity crew together with Laura Coombs. We went to Crystal Maze the other day with players and staff, which we've made a big thing. We want to get together with the staff as well, just to get that connection.\n\nAlex: It's how they know you away from the field as well.\n\nKerstin: Yeah, exactly. More of your personality. Sometimes it can be a bit of a step to approach someone in a leadership role and to get everybody together and just do something fun away from the club in your own clothes creates such a nice bond. You actually have conversations that you might not have at the club.\n\nAlex: I think you've done a cooking class didn't you? How did that go?\n\nKerstin: It was a success - it was Italian dishes. Some people made amazing risotto, they were getting the lemon in and it looked unreal. Some people burned it and some people were screaming that it was sticking to the pan.\n\nAlex: Come on, name names. Who's the bad cook?\n\nKerstin: I'm not going to expose my team-mates.\n\nAlex: Let's talk about temptations and cravings, because people are starting to talk about Manchester City potentially lifting the WSL trophy this season. Are you believing? Why are you laughing at me?\n\nKerstin: I mean, it's kind of funny because we were in such an underdog position going into this season. I felt like everybody was talking about Chelsea, Arsenal, [Manchester] United. It was kind of nice being left out of the conversation and I think we really took that as motivation.\n\nAlex: What do you think has changed?\n\nKerstin: It's little tweaks that matter the most, and also Andree's playing style. We get so much freedom, and also trust and responsibility. Previously it was a good system but a bit robotic at times. We do all the analysis and he gives us everything we need but if something's a bit different, he can't change that from the side. Leaving that space allows us to be adaptable on the pitch.\n\nAlex: What do you put your form down to?\n\nKerstin: I've got such a strong desire to show everybody what I can do and be the best that I can be. I'm really enjoying our offensive style of play this year and linking up with Bunny [Shaw] and Kerolin and all the other incredible forwards that we have. It's just been a joy to work. I go every day with a smile on my face.\n\nAlex: I've always wanted to learn about different cultures and I suppose you have that at Manchester City?\n\nKerstin: That's one of the things I love about football in general. We travel to these amazing places, but also my team-mates are from many different continents and cultures. It's been an eye-opener because I'm from a northern town in the Netherlands. We didn't have a lot of diversity growing up, so meeting these incredible people has been really inspiring.\n\nAlex: There are some cheeky elements to your game, which I absolutely love. Is this you trying to put the opposition off?\n\nKerstin: To be fair, I'm a bit annoying when I'm marking, like trying to push away. I'm not the tallest, I'm not the best at heading so I'm a blocker. Just be the annoying little fly, the little mosquito that doesn't let them head the ball.\n\nAlex: You've now got Dutch team-mate Vivianne Miedama at the club - what's it like having her at club level?\n\nKerstin: She's a fantastic player. In training, it looks so easy and she looks like she's putting in minimum effort and she bangs it into top bins. I swear at her in Dutch - no-one knows what I'm saying! She's such a good player to have with all her experience. A little bit of Dutchness can do wonders.\n\nWatch: Manchester City v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Sunday, 1 February (14:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

It makes it fun and exciting.\n\n\"If Manchester City were to lose the league now it's seen as a negative. If Chelsea were to bridge that gap, that's a huge positive.\n\n\"That mentality is easier as a club to digest. It would be nice to be at the top.

    "title": "BREAKING: BBC Confirms Authenticity of Viral Video Appearing to Show Alex Pretti Kicking Agents’ Car 11 Days Before Shooting",
    "description": "After much speculation online, the BBC has confirmed the authenticity of new viral footage appearing to show Alex Pretti kicking an agent's car on Jan. 13 — 11 days before he was shot to death by Border Patrol agents.",
    "fullText": "Footage published on Wednesday appeared to show Alex Pretti kicking an immigration agent’s car before getting thrown to the ground during a confrontation less than two weeks before he was shot and killed in Minneapolis.\n\nThe News Movement was the outlet that captured the incident on Jan. 13. It said in an X post that it “appears to be Alex Pretti interacting with federal immigration agents” and that it had the clip analyzed by the BBC, “whose facial recognition technology confirmed his identify to a 97% degree of accuracy.”\n\nThe BBC confirmed the authenticity of the video in their 10 p.m. GMT news broadcast. Reporter Ros Atkins said the man in the video “has the same coat, facial hair and gait as Alex Pretti and a facial recognition tool suggests a 97% match. We see him shouting abuse at the agents.” Separately, a spokesperson for the BBC confirmed to Mediaite that they reviewed the footage and verified its team did use facial recognition technology on the video.\n\nYou can watch the BBC footage below, or watch the footage on their website (the relevant portion begins at the :50 mark):\n\nCNN, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, and other outlets have also now confirmed with the Pretti family that the man in the video is Alex Pretti.\n\nA narrator for the video said TNM’s team — comprised of reporters Dallin Mello and Dan Ming — received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street in Minneapolis around 10:15 a.m. When they arrived, they recorded a man who looked like Pretti spitting on a Ford SUV and shouting at immigration agents that they were  “f*cking trash!”\n\nThe man who looked like Pretti was wearing a black hat, brown coat, and had a beard; the narrator noted it was similar to the outfit Pretti wore when he was killed on January 24. He then smashed the right tail light by kicking it two times and flipped the middle finger at the vehicle.\n\nAt that point, “An agent then got out of the vehicle, grabbed him, and pushed him to the ground,” the voiceover said.\n\nThe man who appeared to be Pretti could be seen trying to scurry away from one agent before another agent grabbed him and they both threw him down.\n\n“During the altercation, agents fired tear gas and pepper balls into the crowd,” the narrator continued. “They continued to hold the man down before they retreat and he walks away.”\n\nThe narrator said there appears to be a gun “visible above his waistband” in the footage.\n\nWe were filming a documentary about ICE activity in Minneapolis when we received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street, and captured this footage.\n\nReporting by @danming, Dallin Mello, and BBC Verify.https://t.co/sZcpUBQOpr\n\n— The News Movement (@thenewsmovement) January 28, 2026\n\nThe footage quickly went viral on X shortly after it was posted on Wednesday. Republican communications adviser Steve Guest posted the clip and it pulled in 1.4 million views in its first two hours. He incorrectly said it was a “bombshell report from the BBC” — a mistake several other users made.\n\n“Important context: Pretti was not a peaceful protester,” Guest added.\n\nMUST WATCH: Footage of an a man who looks like Alex Pretti with a gun in his waistband, spitting on and attacking federal law enforcement officers and kicking the tail light of their vehicle on January 13.\n\nImportant context: Pretti was not a… pic.twitter.com/snzEO8rU8w\n\n— Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) January 28, 2026\n\nGreg Price — who lists “Rapid Response Manager” for President Donald Trump’s White House as one of his jobs on LinkedIn — also shared the clip.\n\n“Alex Pretti spits on a federal agent and then kicks out his taillight in footage released by the BBC from 11 days before his death,” he posted.\n\nAlex Pretti spits on a federal agent and then kicks out his taillight in footage released by the BBC from 11 days before his death.pic.twitter.com/64hg4FXv1a\n\n— Greg Price (@greg_price11) January 28, 2026\n\nMegyn Kelly shared the clip and said it showed Pretti had been “itching for another confrontation with Border Patrol, whom he’d been stalking, harassing and terrorizing.”\n\nShe continued, “HE had been victimizing THEM. His felonies are on tape. He was reckless, and it cost him his life. Find another post boy, illegal-loving Leftists.”\n\nAlex Pretti was itching for another confrontation with Border Patrol, whom he’d been stalking, harassing and terrorizing.

Wicketkeepers under the age of 18 also have to wear a helmet when standing up to the stumps.\n\n\"The cricket ball can cause significant injury and it is extremely important that players take the appropriate precautions when batting, keeping wicket or fielding close to the stumps,\" said ECB chief medical officer Dr Nick Peirce when the regulations were introduced in 2015.\n\nThe ECB also advises players to wear neck protectors, but they are not mandatory. In Australia they have been compulsory for all batters facing fast or medium pace in Cricket Australia competitions since the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe regulation was brought in following the death of Phillip Hughes in 2014.\n\nHughes was struck on the top of the neck by a ball during a Sheffield Shield match in Sydney.\n\nHe collapsed and was taken to hospital, where he died two days later.\n\nThe neck protectors attach to helmets to provide extra protection at the back of the head and neck.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhat is Curran's ultra-slow 'moon ball?'\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?\n\nWhat difference does grass make to a cricket pitch?",

Bangladesh had cited safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nScotland were given the spot courtesy of being the highest-ranked team - in 14th - not already at the event.\n\nCricket Scotland officials have been working around the clock since Lindblade picked up a call from ICC chief executive Sanjog Gupta at the start of last weekend.\n\nThere is still a tight turnaround to get all of their players, including seamer Safyaan Sharif who has Pakistani heritage, visas in time to enter India.\n\n\"We're absolutely delighted to have been invited, but it is certainly in unique and challenging circumstances,\" Lindblade told BBC Stumped.\n\n\"We're all confident at the moment we can get everybody out there.\"\n\nScotland are hoping to bring on board a major sponsor and are optimistic a new playing kit for the tournament will arrive before they leave.\n\n\"If we've got kits, that's a bonus. If not, you might see us in our regular Cricket Scotland playing kits,\" Lindblade said.\n\n\"We've got seven days to turn around a sponsor.\"\n\nScotland have effectively inherited Bangladesh's itinerary for the World Cup and will initially be based in Bengaluru.\n\nThey are expected to play warm-up matches against Afghanistan and Namibia on 2 and 4 February at the Board of Control for Cricket in India centre of excellence in nearby Singahalli.\n\nScotland are scheduled to play West Indies on the opening day of the tournament at Eden Gardens in Kolkata and do not envisage that fixture being pushed back at this stage.\n\n\"I think if we were getting worried, we would certainly talk to the ICC about what options are available to us,\" Lindblade added.",

But football is a results business, we all know that, and we have to get back to him and help him quickly to find a solution.\"\n\nWhen pressed about his backing for Cifuentes, the owner added: \"I hope to talk and will assess with him, and the whole club together, and then hope we can find a solution.\"",

Women's players have been allowed to use them by the WTA since 2021.\n\nBut health analytical devices, known as wearables, are not currently permitted at Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n\"Athletes have a fundamental right to understand their own performance and health - including during competition at events like the Australian Open,\" said Whoop, the brand worn by Alcaraz.\n\n\"Blocking access to personal health data does not protect sport.\"\n\nThe Australian Open says it is \"involved in ongoing discussions\" about players wearing the devices in future. But it is unclear why they are not allowed now.\n\nWhoop founder Will Ahmed described the Alcaraz decision as \"ridiculous\" in a post on X, adding: \"Let the athletes measure their bodies.\"",

He was an unused substitute in four of those matches.\n\nThe England international was signed from Crystal Palace in August for £67m to add creativity to Arsenal's attack - he shoots freely, while his ability to open a defence in a flash means he adds an element of flair to the forward line that not many others in the squad have.\n\nThat makes the fact that he played just over 10 minutes in each of the recent 0-0 draws with Nottingham Forest and Liverpool, when Arsenal did not allow either of those teams to have a shot on target, even stranger.\n\nIf Eze is not allowed to showcase his ability when Arsenal need a breakthrough, the questions about where he fits into Mikel Arteta's team will keep coming.",

    "fullText": "There has been open criticism of Michael Carrick's backroom staff appointments at Manchester United, which is one of the most important issues any manager has to address when joining a new club.\n\nUsing my experience of that situation, I want to try to explain his thinking with the people he has brought in since he was named interim head coach, and how I believe what he has done can only be viewed as sensible. It's certainly a long way removed from the accusation that he has just brought in a bunch of his mates.\n\nMichael's aim at United is the same as every manager when you first arrive in a job. You want to establish quickly a clear and defined alignment between yourself and the different football departments within the organisation that you have just inherited.\n\nYou have to be clear on your objectives and set certain principles in the first few days - like a work ethic, for example - that are non-negotiable and must be made absolutely clear to players and staff members who have not worked with you before.\n\nBuilding a strong base with everyone pulling in the same direction takes time and, initially, it can lead to some forms of confrontation with existing members of the playing and coaching staff.\n\nTo be absolutely clear in communicating your intended direction for the club, I believe the manager has to appoint his own members of staff. I always wanted to bring in people I could trust and who were competent in the responsibilities I would delegate to them.\n\nA manager's job is fraught with pressures and if the most important aspects are not prioritised, the amount of work needed in other areas of the club can become a drain on his ability to perform, on game days or away from those match situations.\n\nThis is where your backroom staff is all-important, and it is the same at every club.\n\nI am sure Michael understands that winning games is the be-all and end-all of what supporters want but, behind the scenes, work has to be performed to generate a togetherness and belief in a way that will produce those winning performances.",

He had been experiencing heart palpitations since childhood, and they were only worsening as his athletic career blossomed.\n\nMany could have lived with the condition, but Bukauskas was not just anyone.\n\nHe was a kid who wanted to make his Lithuanian father proud and become a UFC fighter.\n\nAnd here he was having the operation he hoped would make that possible.\n\n\"It was pretty brutal,\" Bukauskas tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"I was awake the whole time. They literally had wires going up my groin into my heart and they were trying to induce palpitations.\n\n\"Then they had to basically burn off an external circuit in my heart to basically fix my heart.\"\n\nThe experience fortified Bukauskas. He would push himself to the limit in training, and a two-year spell playing basketball in Louisiana resulted in him being on the verge of fainting during sessions in 40-degree Celsius heat.\n\nHe was already a British kickboxing champion by the time he had the heart operation, with the palpitations having had him worried.\n\n\"It was very dangerous. I was lucky it never happened in any of my kickboxing fights,\" says Bukauskas.\n\n\"But I think that was a little starting point as to all the hardships I'd have to go through.\n\n\"That was the first steps to being able to overcome anything else that came later on in life.\"\n\nNow aged 31, Bukauskas faces the most important fight of his sporting life when he takes on Nikita Krylov on Saturday evening at UFC 324.",

    "fullText": "Editor’s note: This article contains spoilers for each series of the UK and U.S. editions of The Traitors\n\nThe winner of the fourth series of Traitors UK will not be the psychologist, either of the two barristers — one turned bestselling crime author — or the retired police detective.\n\nThe wild irony of The Traitors, the final of which will be aired on the BBC this evening, is that a social deduction game based around reading people, gathering evidence, and presenting a case never seems to favour people who have spent a career building those skills.\n\nThe aforementioned detective got the whole thing so spectacularly wrong that the only player she pledged her trust to was a traitor.\n\nHow can you look away? Almost 12 million people watched the series four premiere in the UK this month, and the U.S. fourth season has already beaten the premiere of season three. Outwardly, Traitors is a game of deception — the titular ‘traitors’ must eliminate the ‘faithfuls’, by murder and manipulation, while faithfuls must hunt out the traitors and vote to banish them — but it is really a proving ground for every soft skill ever listed on LinkedIn.\n\nEach year, contestants from scores of different industries — diplomacy, medicine, politics, military, teaching — profess theirs has equipped them best to succeed on a show which offers a cash prize to the winning contestant. Which raises the question: how well would football prepare you for the Traitors?\n\nThere are parallels between both, according to Traitors UK series one contestant Dr Amos Ogunkoya, a GP and sports medicine doctor who was previously the club doctor at Luton Town (then in the Premier League) and Colchester United.\n\n“When you’re in the castle, there’s so much noise,” he told The Athletic. “Everyone is throwing out theories. (The edit) focuses on one or two, but there are 10, 30, 50 every day.\n\n“You have to trust your gut a lot more. When you’re working in the Premier League, I can’t explain to you how much noise there is. It’s global noise, and inside, everyone’s got people in their ear. Comfort in that noise and comfort in who you are is really important.\n\n“Football environments are difficult things because, especially at the higher level, they induce — quite similar to The Traitors — a level of paranoia. For a lot of people at the top level, there’s a lot of competition: is (there) someone else in the shadows that wants to take that position from you? The people who rise to the top tend to be the people whom people like.\n\n“The best faithfuls are the ones who adopt the siege mentality. It’s almost like a relegation scrap: ‘We know who we are, and everyone thinks we’re stupid, and everyone thinks we’re gonna go down’. That’s the best way you quickly suss out who’s on your side. I probably got murdered because I was (valuing) cohesion and leadership.”\n\nSuch is the cruelty of The Traitors, the game does not always reward those players the audience perceives as having worked the hardest.\n\nContestants must constantly walk the tightrope between self-preservation and confrontation. Some, like faithful Harriet in UK series 4, swiftly go in two-footed with their accusations, while others hide their suspicions from the traitors to stay in the game. That exercise in diplomacy — how and when to speak — takes place every day in dressing rooms up and down the country.\n\n“Sometimes, there’s no other option other than to go for someone and really say: ‘That’s not on, you’re not behaving in the right way’,” said Wales Women centurion Helen Ward, now head of women’s football at Watford. “You have to bring it up, particularly if you are captain or head coach. You’ve got a responsibility to the rest of the group to call it out.\n\n“I’ve really been lucky to have some brilliant team-mates, but there’s always the occasion where you think: what are they doing behind my back? If it’s another striker, are they trying to bring me down to other people to make themselves look better?\n\n“There’s competition for places, but then there’s being a little bit sneaky about it.\n\n“You know they’re doing things to elevate their own career, and that maybe comes with some behaviours that not everybody would necessarily agree with or do themselves. That certainly would come up from time to time in teams. If you’ve been around that and you’ve picked up on things that people do when they think no one’s watching, that could be a trait that lends itself well to solving The Traitors.”\n\nJake Brown, winner of UK series three, attributed his victory in part to skills gained as a Para Lion with the England cerebral palsy football team. Brown represented England at European and world championships and trained at England’s base at St George’s Park in Staffordshire. That ingrained consistency was crucial in the show, he said.\n\n“If you change your behaviour or character a lot, that’s often seen as traitor behaviour,” he said. “I always used to think: one day, be loud; one day, be quiet. I was trying to get that see-saw balance.\n\n“One of my managers at England used to tell me: ‘KISS — Keep it simple, stupid’. I took that saying into the castle with me. The first couple of days: don’t do anything complicated. Normally, the first thing you think about is the best. That saying goes on the football pitch: the first pass or the first action you see is normally the best course of action.\n\n“When people start to get banished and murdered, that’s when you need to think outside the box, and think a couple of days ahead. If I say this, how will people react? If you’re saying something without a long-term goal in mind, you might get caught out.”\n\nCoaches and managers, of course, must be alert to the moment the courage of their convictions tips into delusion. By the same token, the most galling reverse came in the UK final of The Celebrity Traitors. Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed formed an early alliance with former England rugby union player Joe Marler based on their shared suspicions of comedian and traitor Alan Carr, only to falter and banish Marler at the final round table in favour of Carr.\n\n“My jaw dropped when that happened,” said Jay Sadler, the head coach of WSL 2 side Portsmouth Women. “I couldn’t believe he changed and switched on someone that he formed an alliance with.\n\n“Elite managers have that strength in their convictions and they know exactly what they’re chasing. Sometimes, you look and think, do we stick? Do we need to have more adaptability to win? I’d rather look back and be glad I made a bold move that I felt strategically was the right one than stick with the same, hoping for a different result.\n\n“The difference is I’ve got a multidisciplinary team that I can lean on — analysts and assistant coaches that I know are here for the right reasons. Can you trust everyone on The Traitors? That’s why I think you have to be a little bit more cut-throat with sticking to your own game and your own guns than in football. If you are going off limited information, stick to what you know and stick to your gut.”\n\nThe most galling example of misplaced trust came in the UK series two finale, when disability model Mollie Pearce’s friendship with traitor and eventual winner Harry Clark won out over a more logical alliance with faithful Jaz Singh.\n\n“The interesting thing is they all think, after being together for three or four days, that they know each other inside out,” said Stephen Warnock, the former Liverpool and Blackburn defender turned BBC and Sky pundit.\n\n“You haven’t got a clue who you’re talking to, but people do get blinkers on and forget it’s a game. That’s the one thing that footballers would definitely remember, and I think they’d be quite cut-throat if it meant axing someone or calling someone out. The other side of it is if you had someone who is an ex-captain or a senior player going into the Traitors, they could be seen as a little bit bossy, commanding and trying to lead people. That could be seen as a positive or a negative.”\n\nWarnock pointed out that footballers may have years together compared to the weeks Traitors contestants spend in the Scottish castle. That makes for a more delicate and significant balancing of emotions. Equally, football coaches tread a constant line: building an honest environment while protecting the group, which sometimes necessitates a kind of deception.\n\n“What I’ve learned now is that football management is a bit like acting,” continued Sadler. “You’re going up in front of the cameras and the media want to talk to you, but you already know what you want to tell them — you just manipulate whatever questions are asked and give the answer that you want to portray to the players, staff, and stakeholders.\n\n“The biggest thing in leadership is being honest and being able to build trust. Deception kind of conflicts with that. (In the game), the balance will be key.”\n\nIt is rare that a post-game interview will be as confrontational as a Traitors roundtable, but journalists must be able to ask the hard questions while preserving long-term relationships.\n\n“With football, you know it is just a game, but when it starts getting nasty, or things aren’t going their way, (managers) are still people, so it’s a fine line to tread,” said Sky Sports presenter Michelle Owen.\n\n“(With) The Traitors, I can’t believe this year how there have been so many things (discussed at the roundtable) and then the next day, no one mentions them. You need to bank stuff in your memory. In our job, those little things are so important.”\n\nUltimately, though, The Traitors remains such a difficult show to navigate. Everyone thinks they’re good at reading people until somebody proves them wrong — a bad business partner, a dishonest spouse — and those instincts are tested in a game whose premise often feels illogical.\n\n“You have to be comfortable being wrong,” said Ogunkoya, which sums up the irony of the game. “In any professional sport, you make mistakes, adjust and you don’t have an ego when it comes to it. People can go in (the show) and think they’re good at reading people, become really rigid, and that makes them easy to trick.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSoccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa are monitoring the situation of Fulham attacker Harry Wilson ahead of the winter transfer window deadline, according to the BBC. Aston Villa manager Unai Emery wants to bolster his options in the final third at the Villa Park club and would love to sign the Wales international. Wilson is out of contract at the end of the season, and Fulham are desperate to get the 28-year-old to extend his deal. However, the Villans target prefers to get clarity on the future of Fulham head coach Marco Silva, who is also out of contract in the summer, before deciding over any new deal.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Craven Cottage club will be open to selling Wilson this window, but he could be available for a decent fee if they do. He will be a free agent at the end of the season if he does not extend his deal and more clubs will join the Villans if he becomes available by then. The former Liverpool star has been involved in 13 goals so far this term, with eight goals and five assists to his name in 25 games. Wilson ended last term with six goals and two assists in 25 league games and Villa could do with his quality and experience as they target a top-four finish this season.\n\nGetting him this window could prove tricky for the Midlands club as Fulham are unlikely to be open to losing such a player midway through the season. Villa will also be facing competition from the likes of Brentford, Everton and Crystal Palace for Wilson if he becomes available by any chance this month.\n\nThey have signed Brazilian forward Alysson from Gremio in a £10 million deal, while Leon Bailey has been recalled from his loan at AS Roma, with Donyell Malen joining the Serie A club.",

It is in cinemas from Friday.\n\nNaturally, we asked AI who would play Sutton if a film were ever made about him.\n\nThe best fit, apparently, is Hollywood heartthrob Tom Hardy - who is four inches shorter than BBC Sport football expert Sutton but is AI's top choice for the role because he is \"known for portraying tough, brooding characters with emotional depth\".\n\n\"That just shows how way off the mark AI is,\" said Sutton.\n\n\"But I'm happy with Tom Hardy, even though he is not tall enough. Most people would probably say I am more like Laurel and Hardy though.\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHardwicke, who supports Aston Villa, is his guest for week 23.\n\nDo you agree with their scores?

    "fullText": "In BBC Sport's new Eat & Yap series, Alex Scott meets some of the best Women's Super League players to share the food they love and grew up eating, and talk about life on and off the pitch.\n\nWatch the interview in full now on BBC iPlayer\n\nOlivia Smith will forever be the women's game's first seven-figure player.\n\nAged 15, she won her first senior Canada cap while playing college football in her homeland.\n\nAged 18, she signed her first professional contract with Portuguese club Sporting, announcing her arrival with a goal and an assist on her debut.\n\nAged 19, she moved to the Women's Super League (WSL) to play for fallen giants Liverpool, starring on the right wing as the two-time champions avoided relegation back to the second tier.\n\nIn July 2025, European champions Arsenal broke the broke the world record to bring 20-year-old Smith to north London.\n\nIn the first episode of Eat & Yap the Arsenal and Canada superstar sat down with Alex Scott to tuck into some tasty dishes that reflect her life growing up in Canada and her Caribbean roots, while revealing her footballing idols, a love of Yorkshire puddings and much more.\n\nAlex Scott: So I was told I have to bring maple syrup.\n\nOlivia Smith: Yeah, you're a gem. Maple syrup. Lovely. First of all, I always have, for example, pancakes before a match. I just like pancakes and I always need to have maple syrup. Honestly, I eat this with everything.\n\nAlex: When was the last time you were actually at home in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Oh - probably in the summer, as I spent my Christmas here.\n\nAlex: What do you think of home? Can you build a picture for me of what life was like for you growing up back home?\n\nOlivia: I have a younger sister, so we grew up together. My family were all kind of goofballs I would say. So just playing games a lot, we're always outside, we have dogs as well. So I've grown up with dogs and just go to the park, play football, play with the dogs. That's kind of like what a typical day would look like.\n\nAlex: So your sister plays football?\n\nAlex: What position does she play?\n\nOlivia: Midfielder, winger, striker.\n\nAlex: So does she look up to you and want to follow in your footsteps?\n\nOlivia: I hope so, but she claims she's better than me!\n\nAlex: Does she literally watch your games and say \"You should have been doing this\" or \"You should have scored that goal\"?\n\nOlivia: Yes - she sends me snapchats of my game and says \"Why did you do that?\" I'm like, well, \"What would you have done?\"\n\nAlex: What did she think when you made your move to Arsenal?\n\nOlivia: She was so excited. I mean she also looks up to a team like Arsenal, she loves watching me play so then for me to get the opportunity and really be a role model for her playing with girls like Alessia [Russo] and Leah [Williamson], it's amazing. She's really excited for me.\n\nAlex: Who do you look up to back in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Christine Sinclair. She's a huge legend in the game of course, and also Marta. Then I love watching the men's game as well, so I was always looking up to Neymar, Ronaldinho, Messi, players like that.\n\nAlex: What did your family make of you playing football?\n\nOlivia: I think my dad really grew me into football and he kind of paved the way for me. He made so many sacrifices for me to be where I am today. I also wanted it and he could see that.\n\nAlex: How would your family and friends describe you?\n\nOlivia: Oh, ambitious, crazy... just attacking-minded. My dad always described me whenever I'd play as I'd just take the ball off my own team-mates to go score a goal!\n\nAlex: What was it like for you to make that transition when you finally moved away from Canada playing football?\n\nOlivia: It was quite tough, although I had been away from home for a bit before that. But going to Portugal, for example, it's a whole new world. Different language, different style of football. So having to learn that really on my own was quite tough. But the support system that I had around me was great, so I was able to adapt, I'd say, quite quickly, which is nice.\n\nAnd then, obviously, coming over to England, then that's a whole other environment, style of play, different kinds of people. And obviously it just takes a little bit [of time] to get comfortable. Once you make friends and you're happy, it makes a world of difference on the pitch and off the pitch.\n\nAlex: What would you say is the biggest thing you've learned about yourself?\n\nOlivia: I would say I always thought I was quite independent, but coming here and my ability to make relationships with people on my team and outside of football as well, it has really helped me to acclimatise to what life is like here.\n\nAlex: So we need to explain your background. The Jamaican food - your dad - Jamaican roots, right? And I learned your mum has Chilean and Peruvian roots. What was dinner like at home?\n\nOlivia: Dinner looks different pretty much every day and especially when my grandparents would come by to cook. That's when you know it's on top. So we'd have jerk chicken and my grandpa would make oxtail and my grandmother would make something called seco.\n\nOlivia: It's like a [Peruvian] meat stew and rice, and it's in a green sauce - it's really nice.\n\nAlex: And your grandads played football?\n\nAlex: So when they come round, were there football matches? Were you watching them?\n\nOlivia: I was always playing with them when we went on vacation to the Dominican - we always found a pitch and then we would play pick-up games with random people. My grandparents would join, I would join, my dad and my sister - it was always fun.\n\nAlex: What's your typical day off looking like?\n\nOlivia: It depends on the day and how I feel, but I do pretty much like to stay at home. I like to watch movies, binge watch, I also play video games as well. So, yeah, games, probably a little bit of shopping because I love to shop.\n\nAlex: Right. So if you're not playing football, you are..?\n\nAlex: If one song could be playing when you score a goal, what would it be?\n\nOlivia: I'm going to go with A Milli [by Lil Wayne] because I have that on my pre-match playlists. I think every game.\n\nAlex: The last thing you wrote in your phone notes was?\n\nOlivia: Oh. A bunch of numbers. I was playing an escape room game, so I needed to write down all these numbers so I could put it into a code.\n\nAlex: Since moving to England, what's one thing that you're just like \"I absolutely love this\"?\n\nOlivia: I fell in love with Yorkshire puddings and a Sunday dinner. It's my favourite thing - I absolutely love them now.\n\nAlex: Not many people love Yorkshire puddings.\n\nOlivia: Well, initially I wasn't sure. I was very hesitant because I had in my mind, like gravy on bread. And when I tried it for the first time I thought - how do you even describe Yorkshire puddings?\n\nAlex: Let's think about when we're looking ahead to the season, what are your goals and ambitions?\n\nOlivia: Ultimately, I want to become a better version of myself as a player. I know there's a lot of things I need to develop on, and being at Arsenal that will definitely help me. And ultimately I want to win things.\n\nAlex: Do you feel that you've settled in and the reasons that made you want to come to the club are starting to open up to you?\n\nOlivia: Yeah, 100%. I think the first couple of months it was a lot to really take in, but the girls have been amazing making me feel comfortable.\n\nAlex: Talk me through that first day when you arrived at Arsenal.\n\nOlivia: I was absolutely terrified, yeah, because every time we played Arsenal it was just a massive game. Obviously you never know what the environment is like from the outside, and I didn't know what to expect. And walking in, it was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be - everyone was just so welcoming.\n\nAlex: Who's the MVP, the person that if they weren't there tomorrow you'd be thinking \"this feels strange\"?\n\nOlivia: Less [Russo] really. She just has that personality and that vibe that you can feel at the training ground. It's just very comfortable and you can speak to her about anything. She's just very sweet.\n\nAlex: Renee [Slegers] has just signed a new three-year contract. In terms of the other managers that you've played for, how is she different?\n\nOlivia: She's just very ambitious and I feel like that goes for all around the club. Her values match [the club] and match the players as well, so I think that's just a really great thing to have, and also stability - knowing that she's going to be here for the next three years. To have a female empower us - I think that's her big thing as well, that she wants the players to feel empowered and use our voices - which every time that I've spoken to her I'm like, yeah, that's impressive.\n\nAlex: Do you know about my history with Renee? I used to be her teacher when she first came over. I was a teacher at the Arsenal Academy at the time so it's kind of full circle to see her go on to manage the team. She knows what being at the club means for everyone.\n\nAlex: Talking of the next thing, when you're looking at you and your career, what is it that you want to tick off? What do you want to achieve?\n\nOlivia: Oh, there's plenty of things I want to achieve. I want to win everything, ultimately. And again, the biggest thing is I just want to keep developing and growing as a person and a player. I think that's really important to me, just continue to develop my character, meeting more people and just learning.\n\nAlex: You said meeting more people. How have the Arsenal fans embraced you?\n\nOlivia: They've been amazing. I attended the [Arsenal Women fan engagement project] Block by Block, external consultation a couple of weeks ago where we discussed how we can make matchdays better.\n\nIt was really fun because I got to interact with the fans more on a personal level rather than them being up in the stands and just clapping - actually having a conversation and seeing what we can do to make the experience better for them, but also for us as players. Whether that's music, fireworks, just making it more fun.\n\nAlex: I bet the fans must have been buzzing. Did they know that you were turning up?\n\nOlivia: I'm actually not sure, but they seemed quite shocked when I pulled up!\n\nWatch: Arsenal v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Saturday, 24 June (12:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

There are also bonus points on offer for every round reached across the three competitions, although more points are given to teams competing in the Champions League than in the other competitions.\n\nIn the qualification rounds, these points are halved.\n\nPoints earned are then divided by how many teams from that country entered European competitions at the start of the season.\n\nIn the 2025-26 season, England have nine teams competing in Europe. That means all points are divided by nine.\n\nScotland started the season with five teams competing in Europe. Although Hibernian and Dundee United failed to progress out of the qualifying rounds, three teams remain - but Scotland's points are still divided by five.\n\nFor this season, England and Spain were given one extra spot each as they were the two best-performing nations across the 2024-25 campaign. That meant entry to the Champions League was given to Newcastle and Athletic Club.\n\nFor the 2024-25 season, Italy and Germany were given the two places, known as European Performances Spots (EPS). Bologna and Borussia Dortmund were the teams granted entry.",

The 2024 world champion struggled at the UK Championship, saying he was close to having a \"mental breakdown\" during a 6-4 defeat by Elliot Slessor.\n\nBut he looked sharp on Tuesday when beating Si Jiahui and then came through a classic against two-time winner Neil Robertson to reach the last four.\n\nRobertson leads the one-year ranking list thanks to notable wins at the lucrative Saudi Masters and the World Grand Prix.\n\nMark Williams, one part of snooker's famous 'Class of 92' alongside, Higgins and O'Sullivan lost in round one to Northern Ireland's Allen.\n\nSelby looked back to his formidable best at the UK Championship but fell to Xiao Guodong on Sunday to end his 2026 Masters hopes.\n\nWilson and wife Sophie setting up family support network\n\nWhy snooker's golden generation are still shining at 50\n\nWhat's behind snooker's 147 boom?\n\nBBC Sport has comprehensive live coverage of every shot across BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nYou can also watch the live streams and follow text updates on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nAll times GMT.

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at a dramatic 24 hours for Crystal Palace as captain Marc Guehi agrees to join Manchester City and manager Oliver Glasner confirms he is leaving in the summer.",
    "fullText": "Losing your manager and captain in the same day are two heavy blows that will require time to recover from.\n\nNo sooner had Manchester City struck an initial £20m deal to sign Crystal Palace's captain Marc Guehi was head coach Oliver Glasner confirming he would be leaving Selhurst Park at the end of the season.\n\nNeither development comes as a shock. BBC Sport revealed that City had accelerated their move for Guehi last Monday in light of Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias suffering injuries.\n\nOn Thursday night, following talks between City and Palace, the England defender's move to Etihad Stadium was agreed in principle.\n\nEven if City had failed in their pursuit to sign Guehi this month, the centre-back's contract expires in June and he was leaving regardless.\n\nSimilarly, with Glasner, while his announcement on Friday was unexpected, the fact he has decided to leave Selhurst Park is far from unanticipated.\n\nGlasner said he had communicated his decision to chairman Steve Parish in October, the same month BBC Sport reported that Palace's hopes of keeping him beyond this season were remote at best.\n\nThe pair, according to Glasner, had made a pact to keep the news a secret until they both decided to make their parting public.\n\nThat did not prevent speculation over Glasner, whose decision to leave Palace had become one of the worst kept secrets in English football.\n\nDid the club's decision to sell Guehi to City prove the catalyst behind Glasner's surprising admission in his weekly press conference? Sources have indicated it was a factor.\n\nBut in many ways, the motivation behind Glasner's bombshell media briefing, in which he also admitted the club are open to selling star striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, is neither here nor there for Palace.\n\nThe real narrative for them is preparing for life without their most successful manager and captain in history.",

    "fullText": "Trevoh Chalobah has a big Match of the Day interview coming up this weekend, and the BBC have been teasing little bits of it in advance.\n\nThey asked Trevoh to name his top 3 centre backs and why he liked them so much. His answers tell you a lot about the kind of players he wants to be.\n\n“Number three, Thiago Silva. I used to watch him back in school on Youtube and get in trouble. For me he just has everything. He can head, he can play, when he was in his prime he was quick, he was strong, a leader. I’ve always loved Thiago.”\n\n“Number two I’d go for Sergio Ramos, just a winner. A leader. Always wants to put his body on the line. I used to watch a lot of El Clasico and he would stand out,” the defender continued.\n\n“Number one? John Terry, legend of the club. What he did in the Premier League, what he did for the club. He helped me out a lot when I was younger and I would train with the first team. He would be the one to put his arm around the young players, to help them gain a bit of confidence, you know.”\n\nA very good set of answers there. It never ceases to amaze us how many nice things you’ll find everyone saying about JT who has worked at Chelsea.\n\nYou can see Chalobah speaking in the clip embedded here:\n\nWhile Chelsea delay, their sister club is getting into gear. Strasbourg have already agreed a €7m deal for a talented attacking midfielder who will apparently take his medical today.\n\nChelsea are suddenly seemingly interested in January transfer moves, and Matt Law of the Daily Telegraph has a big update on a potential sale the Blues could made.",

Everyone will know me one day.\"\n\nHis mother may have thought he did not really know what he was talking about. But he knew.\n\nHowever, his path to success has not been straightforward.\n\nHe had to wait until he was 17 to sign for a club, having faced several rejections at trials around Brazil.\n\n\"Thiago would call me late at night in tears to say that football wasn't for him,\" Sergio Goncalves, his mentor from his early years at Gremio Ocidental, a local community football initiative, tells BBC Sport. \"But he was born to score goals.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old has found the back of the net 16 times in the Premier League this season.\n\nHe is on target to reach the 20-goal mark once again in his career - having done so in three of his four seasons in Europe, the only exception being his debut campaign with Brentford, which was disrupted by a serious injury.\n\nThiago's next stop is Saturday's west London derby against Chelsea.",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick has been tasked with saving Manchester United's Premier League season after being named as caretaker manager for the rest of the campaign.\n\nIt is not uncharted territory for United or Carrick, with the former England midfielder having taken charge of three United games following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021.\n\nUnited have considerable experience of operating with an interim head coach. They turned to Solskjaer after sacking Jose Mourinho in December 2018, later offering the Norwegian the full-time position after he lost only once in 13 league games in charge.\n\nThe club also hired Ralf Rangnick to lead the team for six months after Solskjaer's dismissal and Carrick's brief stint, but the Austrian struggled to implement his gameplan and battled with the hierarchy over recruitment - winning 11 games, drawing 10 and losing eight as the Red Devils finished sixth in the Premier League and without a trophy.\n\nUnited will be hoping Carrick can succeed in the same manner as Guus Hiddink, who delivered the FA Cup at Chelsea in 2009 as an interim, and Roberto di Matteo, who led the Blues to FA Cup and Champions League glory in 2012.\n\nBut what does an interim coach do? How is the job different to a full-time position? And is hiring an interim manager a good idea?",

She says Greenland is not a big deal (a “second-order issue” is how she described it to the BBC) – it is a big deal. She says net zero is too expensive – the opposite is true: net-anything-but-zero is a cost we can’t afford.\n\nBut her promise to ban under-16s from using social media, echoing Australia’s recent move, is hard to write off completely; people across the spectrum, including Andy Burnham, agree with it. Nobody who has ever met a teenager, or read the news, will be completely at ease with the role of social media in young lives. There are horrific effects, which have been well documented and inadequately addressed ever since the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing suicide and self-harm content online.\n\nMany platforms, even those that seem anodyne, are purpose-built to spur anxiety, self-doubt, self-harm, anything that delivers attention. We have this completely contradictory environment in which a nine-year-old can’t walk to school alone without turning into grist for a radio phone-in about parental neglect, and yet tech companies with a record of generating emotional distress for profit are allowed access to children’s bedrooms. Grok can generate sexualised images of children on demand, and the UK government calls it a matter for Ofcom.\n\nThe asymmetry of acceptable risk between the real world and the virtual, even while we can see that online harms show up soon enough in lived experience, is inexplicable. It must be more baffling still if you happen to be under 16, working on the assumption that the adults telling you what to do must know what they’re talking about.\n\nEven at the milder end, a lot of social media apps seem designed to mess with a young mind. Take the problems created by location services, whereby kids are able to see one another’s whereabouts 24/7, so discovering in real time what they haven’t been invited to and what their ex-best friend is up to; or the intolerable body-image pressure of a life lived in selfies; or the stress of the streak (a chain of back-and-forth messages or pictures), friendships torched by a slow reply.\n\nIn short, not everything is wrong with Badenoch’s idea; only two things. First, if there’s one thing more ridiculous than taking a corporate failure and throwing it to the individual to solve, by self-discipline reinforced by legislation, it is doing so to under-16s. If a corporation is selling radical misogyny and methods for self-harm – because what else are they going to do, disappoint shareholders? – that is not for a 12-year-old to fix by turning off their phone and taking up crochet. It’s not for a parent to fix, either, by instituting a load of screen limits and parental blocks; even if you enjoy that side of things, it shouldn’t be up to you to fill late-capitalism’s moral void. You could make the case for government intervention, but only if it had time on its hands after tackling the problem at source.\n\nSecond, while young people are unarguably the target of so much manipulative content, to discuss online risks without mentioning older people is frankly perverse. An X user recently asked Grok to identify misinformation super-spreaders on the site from the UK, and probably the youngest among them were Tommy Robinson, 43, and Darren Grimes, 32.. This was data crunched from Amnesty, Global Witness and the BBC, among others, and helpfully built a list of accounts most likely to promulgate untruth or conspiracy, with the caveat it was “subjective and depends on sources”: Nigel Farage, Laurence Fox, Julia Hartley-Brewer, George Galloway, Katie Hopkins, David Icke. None are of a tender age. Between Gen X miscreants and hyper-credulous boomers, there are generations that pose a greater risk to, and are themselves at risk from, the informational ecosystem. Any thinking politician needs to work out how to deal with them.",

    "fullText": "The FA Cup is still the greatest cup competition in the world and the third round is still a special weekend in the football calendar but, speaking from a manager's perspective, it has become more complicated over the years than it used to be.\n\nThe Premier League now overrides the fixture schedule, and I'm afraid the importance of the FA Cup has diminished somewhat because of that, especially when your club's top-flight status and entire financial footing is at stake.\n\nLike most things in life today, money talks and the Premier League without doubt now does most of the talking.\n\nWith three European league competitions as well, and the number of games and teams involved there, the FA Cup has fallen even further down the pecking order.\n\nWith the number of games now being played, something has to give and it is usually the FA Cup. As a manager, I understood why - even though I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when it was considered very special by everyone - and this year will be no different.\n\nAfter a busy festive period and another round of games in midweek this week, the games this weekend will be looked on by the Premier League teams as a chance to rest some of their players, and in some cases all of them!\n\nIt's sad to see, even if it could lead to opportunities for smaller clubs to join the band of giantkillers which the competition has become famous for down the years.\n\nI have experienced both sides of the coin. When we were promoted to the Premier League in 2008, Stoke initially struggled and at the turn of the year, when we came to a third-round tie at League One side Hartlepool, I changed practically the whole team.",

    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has made his predictions for all 32 FA Cup third-round ties.\n\nHe is up against DJ and producer Shadow Child, aka Simon Neale, and AI.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\n\nShadow Child is a Portsmouth fan who has fond memories of the FA Cup that go back much further than when Pompey won it in 2008.\n\n\"That was huge, and so was when we lost narrowly in the final two years later,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But my favourite FA Cup memory was actually 1992, when we had a run to the semi-finals and lost to eventual winners Liverpool in a replay.\n\n\"I was 15, stood on the Clock End at Highbury for the first of those games, and that is when I fully understood the emotion that goes with football.\n\n\"I'd been going to Fratton Park since I was five, but that was the moment for me. That's the power of the FA Cup, and a run like that can resonate with you for your whole life.\n\n\"The year we won it, all five games from round three to the final were 1-0 wins. You take them all, obviously, but most of those ties were not that glamorous.\n\n\"The really memorable game that year was our 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Rio Ferdinand ended up in goal when we scored our winner from the penalty spot, which sounds crazy talking about it now. Again, I will never forget it.\"\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\n5th in League Two v 23rd in Championship\n\nOxford must be short of confidence going into this one. They are in a relegation battle, have lost four of their past five games and are still without a manager after sacking Gary Rowett before Christmas.\n\nCraig Short is in interim charge and, like all teams fighting the drop, I'm sure Championship survival is his priority over the FA Cup.\n\nMK Dons boss Paul Warne is an old team-mate of mine from my village team, Horsford Under-12s, and he learnt a lot from playing alongside me.\n\nThey are going well under him in the league and I have got faith in Paul to deliver an FA Cup shock.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, MK Dons to win on penalties\n\nSimon's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n24th in League One v 13th in League Two\n\nPort Vale are struggling and they are another team who have just changed their manager. This will be Jon Brady's first game in charge, after they sacked Darren Moore at the end of December.\n\nVale got a big win over Blackpool on New Year's Day but they have still got the worst home record in League One, with only two wins there all season.\n\nFleetwood knocked out another League One side, Luton, on penalties in round two which was a great result - so the Cod Army won't be afraid of Vale, either.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Port Vale win on penalties\n\n4th in Championship v 15th in League One\n\nPaul Heckingbottom is doing a fine job at Preston but, with them chasing promotion, he is probably weighing up whether he wants another FA Cup run after his side reached the quarter-finals last year.\n\nWigan have come through two penalty shootouts to reach round three. Their boss Ryan Lowe will be desperate to get one over his former club but, even if Preston make changes, I still think they will edge this.\n\n9th in Championship v 17th in Premier League\n\nMoney-bags Wrexham have picked up a bit of form in the Championship, with one of my colleagues from the Monday Night Club, Conor Coady, their rock at the back.\n\nNottingham Forest got a huge win at West Ham on Tuesday and Sean Dyche will want to carry that momentum on here.\n\nI suspect this will be tight, because Wrexham are unbeaten in 10 games at home, but Forest should have a little bit too much quality.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\n\nEV Charger Points Stadium, 12:15 GMT\n\n18th in League Two v 12th in Championship\n\nI know Cheltenham aren't having a great time of it because one of their fans is a regular caller on 606.\n\nLeicester are having a poor season too, though, and their supporters were expecting a lot more from them following their relegation from the Premier League.\n\nThis is a must-win game for Foxes boss Marti Cifuentes, who is coming under a bit of pressure because his side are toiling in mid-table.\n\nCheltenham will be really up for this, but I think Cifuentes will get the result he needs.\n\n12th in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI'd like to think these teams will have a real go at the FA Cup this season, because neither of them have got relegation to worry about, but they both come into this tie off the back of poor results.\n\nThe Black Cats' defeat at Brentford was a very un-Sunderland like performance compared to what we've seen from them this season, while Everton will be very disappointed to have only drawn at home to Wolves.\n\nThe last time Sunderland reached the final, when they lost to Liverpool in 1992, they broke my heart on the way when they beat my Norwich side in the semi-final. I missed a great chance in that game too, when I ballooned a shot over the bar.\n\nIt still haunts me how we didn't make it to Wembley that year - we deserved to. Sunderland are due another FA Cup run because they have only made it to round four once in the past 10 years, but I don't think this is their year either.\n\nI can see this going to penalties, and Jordan Pickford will win it for the Toffees.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Everton win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I don't see this being a great game, more a battle of attrition. 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n14th in National League North v 13th in Premier League\n\nWhat a tie this is. My 606 co-host Robbie Savage built the foundations for this Macclesfield side and they have gone on an amazing run under John Rooney to get this far.\n\nIt started with a win over Atherton Laburnum Rovers in the second qualifying round in September.\n\nOne of their scorers that day was Ethan McLeod, who died in a car accident before Christmas on his way back from a game, which puts everything in perspective.\n\nThis would be the biggest shock in FA Cup history if Macclesfield won, because no sixth-tier side has ever beaten one from the top flight since the FA Cup started in 1871, but I don't think that will happen.\n\nPalace have not been in good form recently but they played well in their draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday when they defended strongly.\n\nThe holders are solid even when they don't fire up front, and they should win this pretty comfortably.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I'd love this to be different because we all love a giant-killing, but I can't see it. 0-4\n\n20th in Premier League v 22nd in League Two\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards is starting to get a tune out of his players and Mateus Mane is really shining for them.\n\nDoes Edwards change things up here, or does he look to build more momentum?\n\nThis is a local derby but he has played for both clubs so he will get what the tie is all about, and Shrewsbury don't really look like they are in the kind of shape to spring a surprise at Molineux, either.\n\nThey have not won any of their past eight league games and staying in the Football League will be the main thing on their manager Michael Appleton's mind.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n2nd in National League v 21st in League One\n\nBoreham Wood are flying and Robbie Savage always tells me how strong they are - he really rates them.\n\nThey reached the fifth round in 2022 under Luke Garrard, when they lost at Everton, and I think their run will continue this year too.\n\nI know Garrard's focus might be on promotion to the Football League, because getting out of the National League is brutal, but his side are up against a Burton team who are bang out of form at the bottom of League One.\n\nWood will have to stop the top scorer in the FA Cup this season, Tyrese Shade, who has scored five goals in two games for Burton so far - but I am backing them to put Shade in the shade.\n\n19th in Premier League v 5th in Championship\n\nI have a feeling this will be quite close. Millwall are really well organised under Alex Neil and I am not surprised they are doing well this season.\n\nBurnley have started picking up a few draws, but they still haven't won since the end of October.\n\nThis could be the day that changes, although Scott Parker's side will have to work hard to finish Millwall off.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Burnley win on penalties\n\n23rd in League One v 15th in Championship\n\nSouthampton have dropped off after making a good start under Tonda Eckert. He won his first four games after replacing Will Still at the start of November, but has not won any of his past six matches.\n\nDoncaster are on a similar run in League One, taking one point from a possible 18, and with both teams in such poor form, it might take penalties to separate them.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Southampton to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: Putting our south-coast differences aside, Southampton will probably win... but come on Doncaster! 2-0\n\n9th in Premier League v 2nd in Championship\n\nIt will be interesting to see what Fulham boss Marco Silva does here, with his team on such a good run of Premier League results. I hope he goes strong, to try to keep their momentum going.\n\nSilva has good record in the FA Cup anyhow, reaching the quarter-final twice in the past three years. He has also never lost a third-round tie with any of the four English clubs he has managed, and I don't see that changing this weekend.\n\nMiddlesbrough got back on track with a big win over Southampton on Sunday but they hit a sticky patch over Christmas when their goals dried up and it is pretty obvious that their promotion bid will be the priority for their manager Kim Hellberg.\n\n3rd in Championship v 18th in League One\n\nIpswich have started to hit their stride in the Championship and have only lost one of their past eight games.\n\nLike Hellberg at Boro, I suspect Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna will make full use of his squad here but they should still have too much for a Blackpool side who are struggling in League One.\n\nIt is nice to be able to predict an Ipswich result again, and it would be good if their fans had something to cheer about after they had such a miserable time in the Premier League last season.\n\nMcKenna is such a good manager, I think they will get one of the automatic promotion spots, sadly. They won't win the FA Cup though!\n\n2nd in Premier League v 14th in League One\n\nManchester City have reached the final in the past two seasons and they are my pick to win the FA Cup this year. Pep Guardiola always takes the competition seriously and that won't change whatever happens in the title race.\n\nGuardiola's side have paid the price for not putting games to bed in the past few days and those dropped points are making things easier for Arsenal at the top of the table.\n\nI don't see Manchester City having any problems here, though, even if they field a second-string side.\n\nExeter City boss Gary Caldwell lifted the FA Cup in 2013 when he was part of the Wigan team that upset Manchester City in the final. What a great memory that must be for him, but his side are going out on Saturday.\n\n6th in Premier League v 15th in Premier League\n\nI just wonder how much Wednesday night's epic game against Leeds will have taken out of Newcastle, who have got the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final with Manchester City coming up next week too.\n\nThere was also plenty of late drama in Bournemouth's win over Tottenham, but my concern with the Cherries is more about the effect of Antoine Semenyo's departure, because it appears he has played his last game for them.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe does not have a great record against his old club in the Premier League, where he has not got the better of them in seven attempts, but he did beat them in the Carabao Cup in 2022.\n\nI was tempted to go for a Bournemouth win here, but I am not sure how many changes Andoni Iraola will make either.\n\nThe one thing I am sure of is that there will be a few goals flying in, because of the way both teams play. Let's go for another thriller, with a shootout to settle it.\n\nSutton's prediction: 3-3 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\n4th in League Two v 2nd in League Two\n\nThese teams meet each other again in the league next week, and I suspect the points will matter more to Swindon boss Ian Holloway and Salford manager Karl Robinson than this tie.\n\nSalford beat Swindon 3-2 here in September but Holloway's side have the best away record in the division and I'm going with them to nick it in extra time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Salford win on penalties\n\n24th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nIt is really sad to see what has happened at Sheffield Wednesday and there is no way for them to salvage their season now.\n\nBrentford are flying at the moment under Keith Andrews and they are another club who I'd love to see have a real go at the FA Cup this season.\n\nThe Bees have never got past the quarter-finals in their history, and have not even got that far since 1989. You only have to look at Palace last year to find a team winning it for the first time so it is definitely doable for them too.\n\n8th in Championship v 1st in Championship\n\nCoventry are having a little wobble. They are still top of the Championship, but Sunday's defeat at Birmingham means they have only one win in their past five matches.\n\nThat just makes me think Sky Blues boss Frank Lampard will rest players here, and it is a real opportunity for my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins against his former club.\n\nRobins had that great run to the semi-finals with Coventry a couple of years back, and you can imagine he will be absolutely determined that Stoke get through this tie.\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Stoke win on penalties\n\n10th in Championship v 6th in Championship\n\nWatford have really hit form and come into this on the back of four wins in a row.\n\nBristol City, in contrast, have been patchy but again I think both sides will make changes.\n\nIt finished 1-1 at Ashton Gate in November, and I'm going for the same scoreline again, with City winning on penalties.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Bristol City to win on penalties\n\n6th in League Two v 14th in Championship\n\nCambridge are on a heck of a run, and have gone 14 games unbeaten in all competitions since the end of October.\n\nBirmingham, meanwhile, have been a bit flaky. Blues boss Chris Davies needed Sunday's win over Coventry because his side have not really got going this season.\n\nOn paper, this has the makings of a shock because Birmingham have not won many on the road, but I actually fancy my old club to go on a bit of a cup run this year, and they will start by giving Cambridge an education.\n\n12th in League Two v 2nd in National League South\n\nI was at Blundell Park when Grimsby knocked Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup in August, and what a night that was.\n\nNow the Mariners are trying to avoid being on the wrong end of a huge upset themselves but, again, home advantage will help.\n\nWeston-super-Mare are in the third round for the first time in their 138-year history, which is an amazing achievement, but their cup run ends here.\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 17:45\n\n14th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\n\nPoor old Thomas Frank. He looked so happy at Brentford but Spurs have a habit of turning happy managers into total miseries.\n\nHe really needs a win here, and a good run in the cup too, but when you compare the two teams, and the way they are playing, then there's only one winner here - and that's Villa.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: This is the kind of game Tottenham need, because there is less pressure on them. Villa are going more for the top four and Spurs could take this. 3-2\n\n19th in Championship v 8th in Premier League\n\nIt doesn't feel as if Liam Rosenior's appointment has been particularly welcomed by some Chelsea fans.\n\nThis is his first game in charge and he could really do with making a fast start to help win some of the doubters over.\n\nThere are tougher tests to come - like Arsenal in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final next week - but I think he will get the result he wants here.\n\nThere will be a packed house at The Valley, with Charlton's biggest crowd for an FA Cup tie in 50 years, but the Addicks are not in great form and Chelsea's quality should see them through.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: It's been a turbulent week for Chelsea too, and again we will see a response. I always try to visualise things when I think about them, and when I pictured The Valley, I just saw Chelsea scoring! 1-3\n\n13th in Championship v 16th in Premier League\n\nLeeds have been terrific recently and, as regular readers will know, I am really pleased for their manager Daniel Farke and how he has changed the narrative about his future.\n\nI can see Farke making plenty of changes here because, while he would love a cup run, he knows there is still work to do to keep his side in the Premier League.\n\nThat's why I am going for Derby to cause an upset. They are improving all the time under John Eustace and while Leeds will be full of confidence off the back of the past few weeks, I am not sure they will maintain their intensity with a second-string side.\n\n21st in Championship v 1st in Premier League\n\nArsenal will definitely make changes here, but it won't make any difference.\n\nPortsmouth are in trouble at the bottom of the Championship and they look short of what is required there, let alone against the Premier League leaders - or even their reserves.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I very reluctantly have to be realistic here - I hate to say it, but I would be really shocked if Arsenal didn't win. If we took them to penalties that would be incredible, but I don't think we will. It depends what team they put out, but whoever plays, it is going to be difficult for us.\n\nI can't make it to the game but I will be glued to the TV, and my dad will be there - he has been a season ticket holder at Fratton Park since 1967. 0-1\n\n7th in Championship v 20th in Championship\n\nHull are having a great season, while Blackburn are in serious danger of being relegated.\n\nIt is no surprise that Rovers are struggling because they just don't have the quality in their side.\n\nIt turns my stomach to see the state of my old club now compared to the way it was when I was there in the 1990s, because it is a shadow of its former self.\n\nSurvival is all Blackburn fans can hope for, while Hull supporters must be dreaming of a return to the Premier League. They are going to win this tie, too.\n\n22nd in Championship v 3rd in League Two\n\nNorwich are another of my old clubs who are fighting relegation, although at least Philippe Clement has picked up a few wins since he took charge in November.\n\nThe Canaries have lost their past couple of home games, to Watford and Stoke, but Clement has done really well to give them a chance of staying up. Now they need to spend in January, because he needs a bit of help.\n\nI am not sure Clement wants or needs an FA Cup run now but Norwich fans could do with a bit of cheer at Carrow Road.\n\nI am backing Norwich to win but I need to apologise to Walsall boss Mat Sadler anyhow. They were flying last season, but then he came on the Monday Night Club in January and he was one of the managers we cursed.\n\nWhoever came on, their results fell through the floor afterwards, so we were to blame for Walsall's slide down the table.\n\n16th in Championship v 11th in League One\n\nTwo wily old managers go head to head here.\n\nBetween them, Sheffield United's Chris Wilder and Mansfield's Nigel Clough have spent more than 50 years in the dug-out, and I have got a lot of respect for both of them.\n\nWilder has turned things around for the Blades after their dreadful start to the campaign and, while Clough has won his last three games with the Stags, I am going for Sheffield United to continue their improvement.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n17th in Championship v 18th in Championship\n\nWest Brom have just sacked their manager Ryan Mason, so James Morrison is in charge for this one.\n\nThe Baggies could really do with a win but their form on the road is awful - they have lost 10 away games in a row.\n\nSwansea changed their manager recently too, with Vitor Matos replacing Alan Sheehan in November, and their season has been just as disappointing.\n\nWhile West Brom won 3-2 when these teams met at The Hawthorns in November, Swansea pinched a 1-0 win at Liberty Stadium on New Year's Day.\n\nI'm going for another close game this time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Swansea to win on penalties\n\n18th in Premier League v 11th in Championship\n\nThis is a must-win for West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo and, let's face it, they might sack him anyway even if he gets past QPR.\n\nI don't think home advantage helps the Hammers, who suffered a catastrophic defeat against Forest at the London Stadium on Tuesday. I'm not sure how many of their fans will turn up for this game, and the ones who do are not going to be in a good mood either.\n\nBut while West Ham have been very poor recently, they still have some good players and they should surely still see off a mid-table Championship team on their own patch.\n\nQPR have been knocked out in the third round of the FA Cup more times - 52 - than any other side since the current format of the competition started 100 years ago.\n\nI am going for them to suffer defeat number 53, and for Nuno to survive a little bit longer.\n\n7th in Premier League v 11th in Premier League\n\nBrighton have been quite erratic this season, and I have done really badly at predicting their results, but they have proved time and time again how dangerous they are.\n\nIt's a boost for United that Bruno Fernandes is fit again, but their draw with Burnley on Thursday was still a poor result.\n\nI know United fans love it when their side proves me wrong after I predict they will lose, but I can't see them doing that on Sunday.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: United have had an interesting week. I've gone for them to win because I am expecting a huge reaction from them and their fans at Old Trafford, but Danny Welbeck will nick one for Brighton. 3-1\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, United win on penalties\n\n4th in Premier League v 17th in League One\n\nBristol City fans will come to Anfield hoping for a repeat of their famous win here in the FA Cup in 2008, but I don't see another shock on the cards.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot will have learnt his lesson about the cup after last season, when his side crashed out to Plymouth after he made 10 changes.\n\nSlot needs an FA Cup run this season, so I am sure he will not risk another upset here. If Liverpool were to lose this, he would be under serious pressure.\n\nI am just not convinced by the way his side are playing at the moment, and I don't think many Liverpool fans are either.\n\nEven so, they are at home to a League One side, and this should be a pretty routine victory.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The BBC have detailed how it’s a gloomy task for new Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior to reach the minimum aim this season.\n\nThe Blues slipped to 8th in the Premier League table last night after losing 2-1 away from home against Fulham.\n\nMarc Cucurella got himself sent off early in the game with what was a stupid moment from the full back in a moment of madness.\n\nChelsea players then lost their heads in the aftermath complaining about a decision that was a stone wall one in my opinion, with three of their players getting booked for dissent right after.\n\nStriker Liam Delap did manage to get a goal back for Chelsea and everyone started believing that their ten men might actually get something out of the game.\n\nBut any hope was soon crushed there when Fulham pressed on again and found that all important second and winning goal. Chelsea down to 8th in the league.\n\nBehdad Eghbali in the stands at Fulham.\n\nNizaar Kinsella of The BBC writes:\n\n“Chelsea have won just one of their past nine league games and two of 11 in all competitions, falling from potential title contenders in November to a side now lagging far behind.\n\n“They have ground to make up to achieve their minimum aim this season – qualifying for the Champions League, which should be achievable with a top-five finish.”\n\nI think if anything, this is playing it all down a bit. That is a very gloomy looking task for Rosenior, and he only has half a season to do it. Yikes.\n\nChelsea are only five points ahead of 15th place in the Premier League table right now and 17 points off first placed Arsenal.",

    "description": "Find out which players made the cut into the BBC Sport team of the series for the Ashes.",
    "fullText": "BBC Sport readers have picked their team of the series for the Ashes.\n\nWe asked you to pick an 11 that included two openers, four middle-order batters or all-rounders, a wicketkeeper and four bowlers.\n\nHere's who made the cut and their series stats.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 629, average: 62.90, centuries: three\n\nNo doubts about this man's selection. Travis Head stepped up to open in the first Test and has dominated from the top of the order. He blazed 123 in Perth, sealed the series victory with 170 in Adelaide and then added 163 in Sydney for good measure.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 273, average: 27.30, centuries: none\n\nBar Head, the other openers in the series have enjoyed modest returns. Zak Crawley was dismissed for a pair in Perth, but made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 286, average: 57.20, centuries: one\n\nSo frequently a feature of English nightmares, Steve Smith had a relatively quiet series initially, passing fifty once and missing the Adelaide Test with sickness. However, his 138 in Sydney took the game away from England and saw him become the second-highest Ashes run-scorer behind Don Bradman.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 400, average: 44.44, centuries: two\n\nFeast and famine for England's legendary batter. Joe Root finally got to three figures in Australia, making an unbeaten 138 in Brisbane and 160 in Sydney, but only passed 20 on one other occasion in the series.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 438, average: 39.77, centuries: none\n\nA case of what could have been for Harry Brook. The big-hitting batter passed 40 on five occasions in the series, but his highest score was his 84 in Sydney.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 184, average: 18.40, wickets: 15, average: 25.13\n\nA better series with the ball than with the bat for England's skipper. Ben Stokes was frequently England's most threatening bowler, with his best showing a 5-23 in Perth. He made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide but his next highest score was 19, and he was dismissed for single figures on six occasions.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 323, average: 46.14, dismissals: 28\n\nThe default pick for the wicketkeeper position. Alex Carey prospered both behind the stumps and with the bat. After 63 in Brisbane, he had a dream Test at his home ground of Adelaide, hitting 106 and 72 as Australia clinched the series.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 31, average: 19.93, strike-rate: 29.6; runs: 156\n\nA remarkable series for the left-armer. Mitchell Starc started the series with a bang, taking 10 wickets in Perth as Australia blew England away inside two days. He added 6-75 in the first innings at Brisbane while also contributing crucial half-centuries in both the second and third Tests.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: nine, average: 27.11, strike-rate: 53.33, runs: 102\n\nEngland wanted express pace in Australia and Jofra Archer delivered. While his figures didn't necessarily reflect his contribution in the first two Tests, he took 5-53 in the first innings in Adelaide and added a half-century later in the Test. A side strain saw him withdraw from the series after that match.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 20, average: 24.95, strike-rate: 47.9\n\nScott Boland's nagging accuracy tormented England throughout the series. Thanks to the absence of Josh Hazlewood, the veteran seamer delivered in spades. He even got to open the batting in the quick-paced Test at Melbourne.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: 18, average: 20.11, strike-rate: 32.4\n\nWhat if he'd played earlier? Josh Tongue was introduced in the third Test in Adelaide and set about adding to his already impressive haul of international wickets. He took 4-70 in the second innings in South Australia and picked up 5-45 as England bowled out Australia for 152 on day one in Melbourne.\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - Ashes player ratings",

    "description": "BBC Sport profiles twin brothers Tyler and Jack Fletcher, who will hope to get minutes at Manchester United under interim head coach and father Darren",
    "fullText": "Manchester United interim manager Darren Fletcher's twin sons are both currently midfielders at the club.\n\nThe 19-year-old academy duo featured as part of Ruben Amorim's final few matches in charge of United prior to his dismissal as head coach on Monday.\n\nFormer United midfielder and under-18s head coach Darren was promoted to interim head coach in Amorim's place and will take charge of United's trip to Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Tyler has made the bench in each of United's last three games, Jack was used by Amorim in United's last three matches of 2025 as a substitute.\n\nThe brothers are central midfielders. While both can play more defensively, Jack has also played as a winger on the right side.\n\nThe duo are capped internationally. Although they both started with England's under-16s, Tyler switched nationalities to Scotland - the nation his father represented.\n\nTyler and Jack played against each other in November 2025 during a Under-19s European Championship qualifier between Scotland and England.\n\nIn July 2023, the pair signed for United from direct rivals Manchester City for a reported combined fee of £1.25m.\n\nAlthough there was an element of surprise when Jack Fletcher was named in Ruben Amorim's squad for the trip to Tottenham in November, after Kobbie Mainoo pulled out due to injury, in terms of available midfielders he was next in line.\n\nBoth Jack and Tyler have been central figures in Travis Binnion's Under-21 squad this season. While results against senior teams in both the EFL Trophy and National League Cup have not been exceptional this season, United's Under-21 side go into the second half of the Premier League 2 campaign with an excellent record of seven wins and a single defeat from their eight games. The Fletcher brothers are part of that.\n\nJack is viewed as slightly more progressive in his passing, and tends to play higher up the pitch. He has also featured at full-back at times, which may be an advantage when it comes to making matchday squads at senior level.\n\nBoth were part of Manchester City's academy at one stage, and while Darren Fletcher is evidently a guiding light in their careers, he has been keen to let the pair make their own decisions in terms of their playing journey - including which international team they wanted to represent.\n\nTyler is also good on the ball, but is yet to score this season, which Jack has. However, he is also still to be sent off, which is what happened to Jack in the EFL Trophy at Barnsley, when he objected to a refereeing decision in a manner the referee found unacceptable.\n\nShould either of the Fletcher twins play under father Darren while he is in interim charge of United, they would join an exclusive club of sons to have played under the management of their fathers in the Premier League.\n\nJamie Redknapp played under dad Harry at Southampton, while former United centre-back Steve Bruce managed son Alex at Hull.\n\nAlso at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson handed 18 Premier League appearances to son Darren during the first half of the 1992-93 season.\n\nIn that same season, Nigel Clough played every match under father Brian at Nottingham Forest.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy is the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia?\n\nThe cricketer's son recalled by Guardiola - who is Max Alleyne?\n\nIs the new manager bounce real or a myth?\n\nHow does Amorim's record compare to other Man Utd managers?",
