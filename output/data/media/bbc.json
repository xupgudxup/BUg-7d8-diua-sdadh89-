    "fullText": "Kyle Joseph hopes his new relaxed approach in front of goal will give Hull City boss Sergej Jakirovic a headache going forward.\n\nThe 24-year-old former Blackpool man doubled his goal tally for the season in the space of four days with the opener in the 2-0 midweek win over Wrexham before two early goals in Saturday's 3-1 victory at Millwall - the team his dad supports.\n\nAfter ending a seven-match scoreless streak against Wrexham, Joseph told BBC Radio Humberside: \"The last couple of games I've probably stopped worrying.\n\n\"I can't control what people's opinions of me are, all I can control is what I can do on the pitch.\n\n\"Being in the moment and staying in the zone has really helped me, I want to continue with that, taking it a game at a time.\"\n\nThe six points have taken the Tigers back into the Championship play-off positions and Joseph said: \"It's a special win as [Millwall] have been flying.\n\n\"You can see the togetherness of the squad. It's a special group. Everyone is buying into it, pulling in the same direction, from top to bottom.\n\n\"It's so important to have than unity and togetherness. There's a really good feeling in the camp.\"\n\nJoseph said a conversation with team-mate Oli McBurnie the day before the Millwall game had helped him.\n\n\"To have a player like Oli to learn off, there's so much I can squeeze out of him,\" he said.\n\n\"He's played La Liga, Championship and Premier League, he's been down there in the lower leagues too. He gives me ideas and solutions, I find that invaluable and it helps my game so much. He's an unbelievable player and human being.\"\n\nWith McBurnie scoring in his two appearances off the bench after injury, Jakirovic has a dilemma up front, and Joseph added: \"All I can do is try to be in the manager's mind.\n\n\"I'll never kick my toys out of the pram for not being in the team, I want to play but if I don't, I don't sulk, I am a good teammate on the bench.\n\n\"I want to give the manager a headache and show I am ready to play.\"",

    "description": "BBC Scotland previews the Scottish League Cup final between St Mirren and Celtic.",
    "fullText": "Premier Sports Cup final: St Mirren v Celtic\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Sunday, 14 December Kick-off: 15:30 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds & digital\n\nIt's a game which means so much to so many, and for so many reasons.\n\nFor St Mirren, the objective is a straightforward one. Win the Scottish League Cup for only the second time in the club's history. Be heroes. Legends. Deities of Paisley who will never have to buy a beer again.\n\nIn the other half, it's about another trophy to add to the cabinet. But, it's also about arresting a run of two straight defeats for new Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy with the deafening din of fan unrest bellowing towards the club's board.\n\nWhatever happens at Hampden on Sunday, it promises to be a defining day for both sides.\n\nSt Mirren arrive at the national stadium with nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\nAny team who faces either half of the Old Firm in a cup final will know they are up against a huge task. Vastly higher amounts of resources, money, fans and quality set the bar high.\n\nYet, Stephen Robinson's team will emerge from the Hampden tunnel on Sunday with a steely-eyed determination and a swagger of self belief.\n\nIt's founded on both their own ethos and also the fortunes of their opponents.\n\nSt Mirren faced in-form Motherwell in last month's semi-final, a game many tipped the Lanarkshire team to win given their heralded brand of intricate football. Instead, they were outfought, out-thought and outplayed by Saints on the way to a deserved 4-1 victory.\n\nIt was a tactical lesson from Robinson who masterminded the perfect game plan to nullify his old club.\n\nDuring his time at Fir Park, he guided them to a final at Hampden twice in the one season. On both occasions, they came up short against Celtic.\n\nThis time, he'll surely feel that it can be third-time lucky.\n\nSt Mirren and Celtic have played each other twice on league duty this season, and Saints have been desperately unlucky to lose both by a late goal.\n\nThe cause for concern for the 13,000 or so Saints fans going to Hampden will come from their form since beating Motherwell in that semi-final.\n\nFive games have been and gone with just one win, albeit that came in their last game with a 2-0 victory over Dundee United.\n\nSt Mirren sit ninth in the league - although with two games in hand over some of their rivals - but Robinson is famous for his team being well drilled and hard to play against.\n\nThey are tags which Saints took umbrage with in the wake of that Hampden win last month. While many presumed they would just try to stifle Motherwell, the Paisley side were ruthless, clinical, and played with a desire which blew away Jens Berthel Askou's team.\n\n'Old ladies were hanging out windows' - remembering St Mirren's 2013 League Cup win\n\nSt Mirren's journey to Hampden began all the way back in July, in the group stages. After a goalless draw in their opener against Arbroath, who snatched the bonus point with a shootout victory, the Buddies beat Forfar 2-1 then skelped Annan 8-2, helped by a hat-trick from Mikael Mandron.\n\nA 2-1 closing victory over Ayr, thanks to Killian Phillips' double, earned top spot with 10 points from 12.\n\nSecond round: St Mirren 1-1 Hearts (5-4 on pens)\n\nThe Paisley side had their work cut out against high-flying Premiership leaders Hearts in round two.\n\nAlex Gogic put Saints ahead before half-time, only for Oisin McEntee to level with just over 10 minutes to play. The tie went the distance and Shamal George's save from Claudio Braga's penalty in the shootout proved decisive as the Buddies squeezed through.\n\nQuarter-final: Kilmarnock 2-2 St Mirren (3-5 on pens)\n\nYet again St Mirren had to progress on spot-kicks. Mandron and Jayden Richardson struck either side of Robbie Deas' equaliser but a late penalty from Bruce Anderson took the tie to a shootout.\n\nMalik Dijksteel capitalised on Kyle Magennis' miss for the hosts to set up a semi-final against Motherwell.\n\nSemi-final: Motherwell 1-4 St Mirren\n\nThe Buddies had no reason to fear as they cruised past Jens Berthel Askou's highly-praised Steelmen and were two to the good at half-time thanks to Mandron and Dan Nlundulu.\n\nCallum Hendry pulled one back late on but it wasn't enough to mount a comeback as Robinson's side found another two goals courtesy of Richard King and Mandron.\n\nNancy's introduction to life in Glasgow as Celtic manager has been a challenging one, to say the least.\n\nThe former Columbus Crew head coach has two games and two defeats under his belt in what is a pivotal week for the defending Scottish champions.\n\nFollowing the sudden resignation of Brendan Rodgers, Martin O'Neill was sworn in to take temporary charge.\n\nAmid amusing anecdotes in press conferences, leaping about on the touchline and chat about stealing tracksuits as a souvenir of his second spell at Parkhead, a ship that was heading for trouble was steadied.\n\nRangers were defeated in the League Cup semi-final, a heroic showing in Rotterdam stunned Feyenoord, and the gap to league leaders Hearts was narrowed to three points before their visit to Glasgow last Sunday.\n\nIt proved to be Nancy's first game, and one in which the Edinburgh club surged to a 2-1 victory as howls of ire around Celtic Park were swapped for swathes of empty seats before full-time.\n\nNext was Thursday's 3-0 Europa League loss to Roma, with the margin of defeat not reflective of the large gulf between the two teams on the night.\n\nDiscussion of whether Nancy should have been excused from taking charge across this hat-trick of games before beginning his era has raged across the air waves, column inches and social media pages.\n\nFan dissatisfaction at the club's board also doesn't help the backdrop to this one.\n\nAlready there is pressure on Nancy, there always is in this part of town. But what has gone in the last week, and even before he even set foot in Glasgow, has raised the tension level.\n\nWinning the club's 23rd League Cup will not cure Celtic of all its problems. Months of supporter frustration at league placing, a failed transfer window and a botched attempt at Champions League progression will take some undoing.\n\nHowever, victory over St Mirren would provide a firm foothold for the Frenchman to dig into. It's the chance for a first win on the board, an incredibly early shot at a first trophy at the club, and a platform on which to stabilise and build.\n\nIf they don't win, the level of fury from fans could be off the scale.\n\n'Nancy exposed to brutal life as Celtic manager as cup final looms'\n\nCup final victory would 'validate' Celtic process - Nancy\n\nSecond round: Celtic 4-1 Falkirk\n\nCeltic kicked off their trophy defence under Brendan Rodgers back in August, beating Falkirk 4-1 at home with Daizen Maeda, Alistair Johnston and Dane Murray on target along with a Liam Henderson own goal.\n\nQuarter-final: Partick Thistle 0-4 Celtic\n\nThey followed that up by swatting aside Partick Thistle 4-0 in the quarter-final at Firhill. Sebastian Tounekti scored his first goal for the club and Yang Hyun-jun, Liam Scales and substitute Luke McCowan also netted.\n\nSemi-final: Celtic 3-1 Rangers AET\n\nQuestions were raised about the 73-year-old's return but O'Neill kept the momentum going as Celtic sailed to a 3-1 win after extra time over their fierce rivals.\n\nGoals from Jonny Kenny, captain Callum McGregor and Callum Osmand secured their passage to the final.\n\nSt Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: \"There will be a nervous energy, of course. We aren't Celtic who get to every cup final or every other cup final.\n\n\"So we have to embrace the day and enjoy the day but most of all what I coin it with is have faith over fear. Really believe in the system, in each other, in the staff, and the stuff we've put on in preparation.\n\n\"We see all the photographs of the teams that have been very, very successful here and won trophies and they're held in such high regard. What I try and do is to tell the players 'We want your names there, we want your pictures there'.\n\n\"They've got their pictures up for the European achievements, for the top-six achievements, now we want them up [for winning the cup]. We want them to be remembered, we want them to be recognised everywhere they go for the rest of their life.\"\n\nSt Mirren defender Marcus Fraser: \"In 10, 20 years, people will probably still be talking about it [a win] and you can obviously write your own chapter in the club's history.\n\n\"So I think that's one of the key aspects that we want to do, really grab the opportunity with two hands and if we can get up on that wall, then in a few years' time, when you walk by it, that would be a great feeling.\"\n\nCeltic manager Wilfried Nancy: \"Yes, I would like to win the trophy. I'm pretty sure that, if we don't win it, it's going to be difficult, because when we lose, this is painful.\n\n\"But, again, I am optimistic as a person. So hopefully we're going to do it. And also if it's going to validate what we are doing. But, if not, I don't want to think about this because, for the moment, I want to stay positive and this is the way I think.\n\n\"I'm going to have many, many other times to show, to do my stuff and to convince the fans that I am the right guy.\"\n\nCeltic midfielder Luke McCowan: \"We're disappointed as a team with the last two results and we need to get on top of it.\n\n\"We have to [stick by Nancy], there's no way around it. He's the manager, he's got his staff with him, we're players at this club. He's the one that's going to lead us into victories with whatever style and whatever management the way he wants.\n\n\"Once it clicks then we're hopefully thinking that's going to propel us into the performances we need and winning games most importantly.\"",

    "fullText": "Mid-table Brentford face a resurgent Leeds side, who have won four points in their past two matches against Chelsea and Liverpool. BBC Sport looks at some of the key themes ahead of Sunday's match.\n\nBrentford have won just one of their four Premier League games against Leeds and will be looking to avoid three straight defeats in the Premier League for the first time since February 2024, after losses to Arsenal and Tottenham.\n\nIt was more away day pain for Keith Andrews' side last week in north London as they gave a toothless display at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The Bees had just four shots in the match, with one on target and a measly xG of 0.29.\n\nWhile their mid-table figure of 21 Premier League goals for the season doesn't ring immediate alarm bells, the spread of those goals may be a cause of concern. Striker Igor Thiago has scored over half - and five of his 11 have been from the penalty spot.\n\nRecord signing Dango Ouattara has won four of those penalties, more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues. This game will be Ouattara's last appearance before leaving to represent Burkina Faso at the Africa Cup of Nations. Brentford will need the likes of Mikel Damsgaard and Kevin Schade to fill this creative void. As it stands, veteran midfielder Jordan Henderson leads the way at the club for Premier League assists, with three.\n\nLeeds had lost four straight Premier League games going into their midweek fixture against Chelsea last week, using a 4-3-3 formation. But for the second half against Manchester City in the final fixture of those four defeats, Farke deviated from his usual four at the back to try a 3-5-2.\n\nDespite being pipped 3-2 by Pep Guardiola's side, the performance was encouraging and Farke has since started his side in a 3-5-2 in subsequent fixtures against Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nThe results have been stark, with four points from two matches against established heavyweight sides and three goals scored in each. It is as many times as Leeds had scored three in the Premier League across their previous 37 games.\n\nBrentford have had mixed fortunes facing the formation. They have won just twice in the seven games they have played in the Premier League against sides using a 3-5-2.",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace can move to within two points of Manchester City when the sides meet this weekend. BBC Sport examines some of the key themes before Sunday's match.\n\nPalace have never beaten Pep Guardiola's City at Selhurst Park but they did come out on top in last season's FA Cup final, claiming their first major trophy courtesy of a 1-0 win.\n\nThe Eagles only had 22% possession in the final but were able to stifle City's attack while remaining a threat on the counter. That's been a strategy regularly employed by boss Oliver Glasner – 17 of Palace's last 20 league wins have come in matches where they have had under 50% possession.\n\nThe Londoners, who claimed a comfortable Conference League win at Shelbourne on Thursday, have started the season impressively. They already have 26 points, which is twice as many as at this stage last year and their highest figure after 15 Premier League games.\n\nHowever, the festive period could prove a testing one for Palace's relatively shallow squad. Ismaila Sarr, their second highest scorer this term, is expected to report for Africa Cup of Nations duty with Senegal next week, providing he overcomes a recent injury.\n\nTo make matters worse, wing-back Daniel Munoz, who was outstanding against City at Wembley, will be out for at least four weeks following knee surgery.\n\nCity win again but Guardiola demands more\n\nManchester City made it four wins in a row – and eight victories from their past 10 games – by beating Real Madrid on Wednesday, but Guardiola was quick to bring his side back down to earth.\n\nHe insisted City have produced better performances at the Bernabeu without winning, adding \"that level is not quite enough\" for success in the latter stages of the Champions League.\n\nThe Spaniard was also the party pooper after last weekend's 3-0 victory over Sunderland. Summer signing Rayan Cherki starred in that game, assisting two goals, but Guardiola appeared unimpressed by the Frenchman's rabona cross for City's third.\n\n\"I want players to do the simple things well,\" the manager said afterwards, pointedly noting he has never seen Lionel Messi attempt a rabona.\n\nGuardiola is hardly known for simplicity in team selection, with his penchant for rotation – and so-called 'Pep Roulette' – a familiar frustration for fantasy football managers.\n\nYet this season, the 54-year-old has relied on continuity more than in the past. Wednesday's win in Madrid was the fifth time he has named an unchanged starting line-up in the current campaign. Before 2025-26, he had never done so more than twice in a season with City.",

About 1.5 million people have been affected - more than half the country's population - and 28 people were killed.\n\nIt took Williams' team-mate Abigale Sutherland several days to track down her grandfather, whose roof had been blown off his house, and the lack of power also meant training together as a national side became impossible.\n\nJamaica's two home legs of the four-test series were cancelled but they will play England twice this weekend in the Horizon Series, which you can watch on the BBC.\n\nFor both teams, these fixtures are about a lot more than the result.",

    "fullText": "Heroes are made on derby day and sometimes the big goals come from unlikely sources.\n\nI think back to Nikos Dabizas' header at the Stadium of Light in 2002 and the Ryan Taylor free-kick in 2011 that sparked scenes of huge celebration among thousands in black and white behind the goal.\n\nAway fans have since been moved to the upper tier at the Stadium of Light - something that probably benefits Sunderland.\n\nThere has only been one north east derby in the nine years I have been BBC Radio Newcastle's commentator - a comfortable 3-0 win for the Magpies in the FA Cup two seasons ago. Then, they were a division apart but this weekend, only a point separates the teams.\n\nSunderland may have had the upper hand in the derbies before the clubs' respective relegations, but I welcome the return of the fixture.\n\nUnlike in the 2010s - when both were either in mid-table or fighting relegation - this weekend's match will be contested by two good teams, representing ambitious clubs.\n\nEddie Howe said his first words to the players about the derby were delivered in the dressing room after the draw with Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday. That is because Newcastle's focus has been on their Champions League campaign while also trying to improve their Premier League position, which they have managed to do since the November international break.\n\nHowe would have liked a full week to prepare but the Magpies are now so used to playing every three or four days that a lack of training time should not be a problem.\n\nTheir record under Howe in the biggest matches is very good and he has top-level players who will love an occasion like this.\n\nI sense uncertainty among the fanbase about how Sunday will go. Many consider Sunderland favourites after their impressive return to the Premier League. Newcastle's bad habit of throwing away a lead and conceding late goals - sometimes doing both in the same game - adds to the unease.\n\nBut, I think the extra quality of the away side will make the difference and ensure three points go back to Tyneside.\n\nExplore Newcastle content on BBC Sounds",

Again, we need to evolve our things that can counter what the opponent is doing.\n\n\"The basics and the foundations of how we do things are at a good level. Now, we need little tweaks - when we attack, how we can be more balanced in defence, attacking the box, how we can find this final pass.\n\n\"The basics are there, the foundations are there, the principles are there.\"\n\nTonight, St Johnstone take on fourth-placed Ayr United at Somerset Park. Currently 11 points behind the leaders, Scott Brown's side surely need a victory if they are to keep any title ambitions alive.\n\nWhile St Johnstone's midweek KDM Evolution match with Hearts B was postponed due to high winds in Edinburgh, Ayr's match with Peterhead went ahead, with the Honest Men winning 2-1.\n\nThe good news for Ayr was a first goal of the season for striker Anton Dowds, who missed a year of football after suffering an ACL injury. The 29-year-old only returned to match action in September.\n\nBefore his injury last season, Dowds was one of the hottest strikers in the Championship and Brown will clearly be hoping he can return to that kind of form from now until the end of the season.\n\nThistle will be watching proceedings this evening with interest. Any slip up from Saints gives them the chance to grab top spot on Saturday.\n\nHowever, that will be far from simple for the Jags as they travel north to take on third-top Arbroath.",

    "fullText": "I understand the great debate over the falling out between Mohamed Salah and Arne Slot but let me make my own point as someone who managed for more than 30 years.\n\nBoth Slot and Salah are being paid enormous salaries by Liverpool, one to manage and the other to play.\n\nThey both have the responsibility to act in the best interests of the club, and nothing else should come into it.\n\nPersonal views about each other cannot, and should not, come into the equation - for manager or player. The club needs every one of its coaching staff and players to be united with one aim, which is to win football matches.\n\nI have never known a manager pick a team that he believes will lose games and, at the moment, Salah is not playing because Slot does not consider him as being a starter in his best XI.\n\nSlot, as a manager, understands that there can be only one singer, and one song being played, and that he conducts it.\n\nAs a player, Salah must look up to the stands and see two other great Liverpool goalscorers in Ian Rush and Kenny Dalglish, and recognise that even the greatest players come to a stage in their career where the club moves on.\n\nAt Liverpool, Salah has had a wonderful platform to show off his fantastic abilities. Over many years he has rightly become an Anfield legend and, if he leaves in the next transfer window, let's hope for all concerned that this spat can be washed away and fans can remember the fantastic memories he gave them.",

    "fullText": "Authorities in Switzerland have arrested the husband of a former finalist for Miss Switzerland, alleging that he strangled her to death before dismembering her and blending her body parts.\n\nKristina Joksimovic was killed during the February of 2024, according to the BBC.\n\nPolice referred to the 38-year-old beauty queen by her initials in court documents, which further noted she was a finalist in the Miss Switzerland competition back in 2007. Swiss media has identified the husband — who is not named in the docs — as Thomas. Investigators, however, did reveal that the suspect is a 43-year-old male.\n\nThomas has been formally charged with his wife's murder as well as disturbing the peace, prosecutors announced on Thursday, December 10.\n\nThomas had previously told investigators that when he returned to their Binningen home the night of the murder, he found Joksimovic already dead. But less than a month later, the husband was changing his tune, according to police. He allegedly later told detectives he had actually killed his wife in an act of self-defense.\n\nBut forensic experts later determined Joksimovic had been beheaded Joksimovic prior to her death, and that her remains showed no signs of a struggle, contradicting her husband's account of the events.\n\nDetectives started investigating Joksimovic's death almost immediately after it happened, noting its suspicious nature, but her husband was not officially charged with the beauty queen's murder until this month, according to prosecutors.\n\nThrough an autopsy, medical examiners were able to determine the husband allegedly dismembered Joksimovic using a jigsaw and garden shears.\n\nThe reports further claim police said that the victim's womb had been \"carefully removed\" by Thomas as part of a \"deliberate mutilation or ritualized degradation of the body.\"\n\nThe husband allegedly proceeded to slice up her body parts and then used an industrial grade blender to liquefy her remains.\n\nLindsay Shiver Set to Be Released on Bail After Allegedly Plotting to Kill Estranged Husband\n\nLocal reports described the body as having been \"puréed.\" The husband also allegedly added a chemical dissolvent to help break down his wife's body.\n\nAs he cut up her remains, the husband allegedly watched videos on YouTube.\n\nJoksimovic and Thomas have two young children together.\n\nUs Weekly was unable to determine if the husband has been asked to enter pleas to the two charges filed against him. It was also unclear if he had hired an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\n\nLocal media is reporting Joksimovic's own father found her remains, after noticing strands of blonde hair sticking out of a black bag.\n\nThe husband will remain in custody until his next court date, which has not been set yet.\n\nAccording to her Instagram profile, Joksimovic primarily worked as a modeling coach. Her page features instructional videos on mastering the catwalk as well as footage of her working with her clients on their walks.\n\nIf you or someone you love is experiencing domestic violence, you are encouraged to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at (800) 799-7233 or visit thehotline.org.

    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah's incendiary interview attacking Liverpool head coach Arne Slot and the club after he was left out of the draw at Leeds United contained one memorable soundbite that stuck out above many others.\n\nIt was the 33-year-old's claim he had been \"thrown under the bus\" after a glittering Liverpool career encompassing all major prizes and 250 goals that put him third on their all-time list of scorers.\n\nSalah's outburst came after he was left on the bench for a third successive Premier League game as Slot tried to end a sequence of nine defeats in 12 games.\n\nThe Egyptian did not disguise his belief he had been made a scapegoat, provoking divisive debate when Slot and Liverpool needed unity and calm – but was his claim justified?\n\nSalah says he has been 'thrown under the bus' by Liverpool\n\n'A clear challenge to Slot's authority in Salah's show of rebellion'\n\nSalah has the selfish streak and pride that is the preserve of all the greats – as was seen when then Manchester United manager Erik ten Haag, a Dutch countryman of Slot, dropped Cristiano Ronaldo at the end of his second spell at Old Trafford in November 2022.\n\nRonaldo's response was to give an interview to Piers Morgan on TalkTV in which he complained, as Salah has effectively done now, that he was \"betrayed by the club\".\n\nManchester United and Ronaldo agreed, within days, to cancel his contract.\n\nSalah's contract will not be cancelled.\n\nLiverpool would, if they sold, demand a sizeable fee for a global figure who signed a new two-year contract in May, but such is the Egyptian's strength of feeling, reconciliation looks difficult.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Salah will even get the farewell he hinted at when Liverpool play Brighton on Saturday before he heads off to the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nSo does the evidence support Salah's assertion that \"it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame\" and that \"someone doesn't want me in the club\"?\n\nSalah has been a shadow of his old self this season. For the first time, someone who looked at the peak of his physical and footballing powers last season has started to look his age.\n\nThe contrast in numbers is stark and unflattering.\n\nHe was the inspiration as Liverpool won a 20th title last season, scoring 34 goals in 50 starts in all competitions. This term he has made 16 starts, scoring only five times.\n\nSalah's ability to do defensive dirty work was also called into question, with Chelsea's Marc Cucurella suggesting they targeted Liverpool's right flank in their 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in October because he was \"always ready to attack\".\n\nNot a problem when Salah is providing a regular supply of goals, but brought into sharp relief when they dry up.\n\nSalah, however, feels he is right to flag up he has hardly been Liverpool's only problem this season.\n\nHe, more than anyone, has missed Trent Alexander-Arnold after his move to Real Madrid, the pair forming a magnificent partnership as Liverpool claimed major honours, including two Premier Leagues and the Champions League.\n\nAlexander-Arnold played 147 line-breaking passes for Salah when the title was won last season, the most any player provided for a team-mate in the Premier League.\n\nFormer Liverpool and England defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport: \"Trent leaving has had an impact on Salah. Their partnership, if not exactly unnoticed, was almost taken as read. They are world class individuals, but it was also a partnership.\n\n\"They really complemented each other. Trent could go inside, draw people towards him, which freed up more space for Salah. And when Salah drove at people he had the ability to feed Trent because teams were backing off.\"\n\nSalah can also point elsewhere in Liverpool's team and wonder why others have not received the same treatment.\n\nIbrahima Konate's poor form is irrelevant as he is a central defender and Liverpool lack cover, but Cody Gakpo's contribution on the left flank has been fleeting this season, the Netherlands international too predictable.\n\nFlorian Wirtz has offered little since his £116m move from Bayer Leverkusen while Alexander Isak, a British record signing at £125m from Newcastle United, has scored one Premier League goal.\n\nAnd yet it is Salah who has been sacrificed.\n\nSalah did not name names, but it is understandable a world class player and one of Liverpool's all-time greats would feel he has been singled out\n\nThe argument has merit. Its expression did not.\n\nLiverpool's head coach – whoever it was – would eventually have to handle a transition that would conclude Salah's Anfield career. This task has fallen to Slot.\n\nThe fact it comes so quickly after Salah won last season's Professional Footballers' Association player of the year, the Football Writers' Association Footballer Of The Year, as well as Premier League player of the year and the Golden Boot, makes it even more contentious.\n\nNo player has limitless credit – think Steven Gerrard being nudged towards Anfield's door by Brendan Rodgers in 2015.\n\nDoing nothing was not an option. Dropping Salah was a pragmatic choice to stop Liverpool being so vulnerable and more defensively solid. The champions have conceded 24 goals in 15 league games compared to 41 all last season.\n\nSlot also spent £450m in the summer, the clearest signal Liverpool were moving into a new era.\n\nIn public, Slot has been nothing but respectful to Salah, although the player is convinced their relationship is now broken.\n\nSlot said after Salah was dropped to the bench for the win at West Ham United, the first time in a Premier League game since April 2024: \"No matter if he plays well or if he doesn't play well, if he plays or doesn't play, he will always be that top professional and that's what he was in the last two days.\"\n\nIt should also be noted that Salah had only been on the bench for three games in six days before making a rare, but as always carefully calculated, stop to speak to reporters at Elland Road.\n\nSlot also had to plan for the short and long term, with Salah leaving for Afcon after the Brighton game.\n\nThe Dutchman must deal in reality not sentiment. He needed results quickly and Salah's numbers have not read well.\n\nSalah's legs have not carried the pace of old. His dribble success is down to 23% this season compared to 56% in his first season. Can he still go past players?\n\nSlot places great store in winning duels – and Salah's rate is down to 28% from 38.7% in his first season.\n\nSalah's exclusion has, to an extent, worked, with Liverpool winning twice and drawing twice in his absence, including the vital Champions League win against Inter Milan in the San Siro.\n\nSlot's selection at West Ham provided a clear signpost to life without Salah, as the all-round strength of Dominik Szoboszlai was deployed in his right flank role with Wirtz dropping behind a striker to pull the strings.\n\nHe then used a diamond midfield in Milan, with Wirtz on the bench and Isak and Hugo Ekitike as twin strikers.\n\nThis means Slot can point to the fact Liverpool have not lost since Salah was dropped.\n\nThe argument, however, will rage on.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "England being two-nil down after two Tests of an Ashes series has few positives, other than a) increasing the likelihood of a stage musical about the series being written if a stirring comeback leads to a historic 3-2 victory; and b) familiarity.\n\nThis the eighth time in the past 10 Ashes tours of Australia that England have lost the first two Tests, and the 12th time in the past 20 Ashes contests in either hemisphere - a sequence that began in 1989 when England attempted to fight fire with selectorial mayhem, making four changes after each of the first four Tests, then treating themselves to six changes for the sixth and final match.\n\nSince the Second World War, England lead the 'Losing the First Two Tests of an Ashes Series' competition by an impressive margin of 17 to 2, with Australia's only experience of what has become the default state of Ashesness for England coming in 2013 and 1978-79 (when almost all of Australia's first and second-choice players were playing World Series Cricket rather than the Ashes).\n\nWhile the fading echo of the first day in Perth, the various acts of miraculous fortune-flipping in captain Ben Stokes' career, Joe Root having finally added his name to an Australian honours board, and the theoretical brilliance of England's batting line-up offer morsels of optimism if you squint hard enough, Ashes history offers little statistical succour.\n\nIn 16 of those 18 previous post-war Ashes rubbers in which a team has trailed 2-0 after two Tests, that side has lost the series by at least three Tests. In 1994-95, England micro-bucked the trend by losing only 3-1.\n\nThe glaring exception to the hefty thrashing rule was England in the 2023 series, so England's entire top six has recent experience of coming close to being the first side without Australia legend Don Bradman in it to fight back from two matches down to win an Ashes series.",

He was also named as the PFA men's player of the year for a record third time and collected a third Football Writers' footballer of the year award.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the highest-scoring overseas player in Premier League history, overtaking Sergio Aguero's mark of 184.\n\nSalah has scored five goals in 18 appearances for Liverpool so far this season, and on Saturday said he felt like he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and that his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.\n\n'The hunger makes me want more' - Salah wins third PFA award",
