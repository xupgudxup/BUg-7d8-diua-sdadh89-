    "fullText": "Newcastle's goalkeeper on this day 15 years ago - the day of the famous 4-4 draw with Arsenal - was Steve Harper, who told BBC Radio Newcastle his recollections of the match.\n\n\"I can't believe it was 15 years ago. I'll never forget it because my youngest was 12 days old so I remember thinking during the first half 'this is the first and last Newcastle game he'll ever come to when I'm playing'.\n\n\"After Chris Hughton, who was popular with the players and fanbase, was dismissed and Andy Carroll left the club in recent months, the dark clouds were circling and were then amplified over the course of the first 45 minutes.\n\n\"We were 2-0 down after three minutes. We just needed to take a breath and get a foothold in the game, but they were relentless.\n\n\"We were 3-0 down after 10 and in shock. When we go 4-0 down after 26 minutes, I remember lying on my back and thinking 'we need half-time now'.\n\n\"I went in and said if any of you so-and-sos wave the white flag I'm going to be the first goalkeeper in Premier League history to let 10 goals in.\n\n\"Alan Pardew, we didn't see eye to eye, but he came in and he was brilliant and said 'Look lads, you need a response, the crowd need to see a response, you need to respond for each other. Your family and friends are in the crowd, what are they going to be thinking?'\n\n\"I thought it was really good because it's not a time to start ranting and raving and turning players on themselves.\n\n\"Kevin [Nolan] refereed the game without the referee knowing. He was an intimidating character who was streetwise. He knew if we tried to play football it would be six or seven - what we needed to do was the dark arts, get competitive and be horrible, which we were in promotion from the Championship.\"\n\nOn Cheick Tiote's equaliser: \"I had the ultimate view. It was perfect, on his weaker foot. Never seen him do anything like it. It had a clear path and I knew it was in.\n\n\"The noise. In 33 years of being in and around St James' Park I've never heard anything like it. Tiote runs the length of the pitch and I ran towards the celebrations and elbowed Leon Best in the hamstring and he has to go off! Maybe we would have won the game if I hadn't.\n\n\"You just do mad things. People still talk about it to this day.\"\n\nCome back later today for fan accounts and more players who featured in the fixture\n\nSend us your memories of the game here\n\nListen to BBC Radio Newcastle's special coverage looking back on the day",

    "description": "Hassan Ishaq is beginning his boxing career with just two fights under his belt. BBC Sport speaks to his team the \"delicate\" task of building a prospect.",
    "fullText": "\"I'd rather fight than do interviews.\"\n\nThis short, sharp sentence tells you everything you need to know about Hassan Ishaq.\n\nIn an era of influencer boxing, where manufactured social media feuds can outshine the sport itself, the 22-year-old super-bantamweight from Slough has little interest in clout or cameras.\n\n\"I'm not used to the spotlight. I just love the sweet science of boxing,\" he tells BBC Sport.\n\nMastering the art of self-promotion will come in time but, for now, Ishaq is backed by a team determined to ensure his talent does not go unnoticed.\n\nFrank Warren, a promoter who has navigated the shark-infested waters of British boxing for 45 years, is guiding Ishaq's first steps in the paid ranks. And in trainer Huzaifah Iqbal, he has a voice outside the ropes - a hype man, strategist and mentor rolled into one.\n\n\"Hassan's going to be pound-for-pound one of the world's best,\" says a beaming Iqbal.\n\n\"A multi-weight world champion like Manny Pacquiao, inshallah. One day, we'll have Michael Buffer introducing Hassan and listing all the belts in all the divisions.\"\n\n5 Live Boxing: Kelly becomes champion as Big Baby loses his lid\n\n'Spooky premonitions' drive unfancied Kelly to top of boxing mountain\n\nEdwards to fight Powar for British title on BBC\n\nTalent, belief and dedication can take a fighter far but making smart decisions early on will determine the height of Ishaq's ceiling.\n\nIqbal describes the transition from amateur to professional as a \"delicate\" stage, where careers are often made or broken.\n\n\"The first five or six fights are the real transition,\" he says. \"The work Hassan does in the gym now - and with the sparring partners we bring in – is more important than later.\n\n\"As you get older, your muscles become cemented. It's harder to change.\"\n\nCrucially, Iqbal believes the trainer must be involved when it comes to match-making, making sure opponents aid development rather than simply pad a record.\n\n\"Boxing is a messed-up sport. Sometimes managers who have never boxed find opponents,\" he says.\n\n\"But it should be the coach, because the coach knows the fighter's strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\nEven the sport's greats needed learning nights. Pacquiao's first three bouts went to points. In his second pro fight, Floyd Mayweather went the four-round distance with awkward southpaw Reggie Sanders and had to deal with a cut in the third.\n\n\"We want opponents who make Hassan show what he can do. Who can test his grit and take his power. Hassan can box with both hands and we want someone who throws something back so he can slip, counter and whack.\" Iqbal adds.\n\n\"We have to remember he's only 22 but if he continues to keep pushing and learning, he will go all the way.\"\n\nIshaq will be searching for a third consecutive stoppage win on the undercard of featherweight Nick Ball's world title defence against Brandon Figueroa in Liverpool on Saturday.\n\nA three-time England national champion and gold medallist at the prestigious Haringey Box Cup, he boasts strong amateur pedigree.\n\nSuch is the buzz around him that the end of his amateur career was marked with a celebration event in London which included messages of encouragement from heavyweight titan Anthony Joshua and unbeaten middleweight star Hamzah Sheeraz.\n\nYet for all his amateur success, Ishaq never considered staying on to chase Olympic glory.\n\n\"I had about 50 fights and won about 40,\" he says. \"But I felt like in the amateurs, I used to get robbed a lot. Decisions never went my way and it disheartened me.\"\n\nThat disillusionment led him to the professional ranks. Nicknamed 'Shooter', Ishaq describes himself as a \"thinker\" rather than a brawler.\n\n\"I'll be a world champion within five years, 100%. I know what I'm capable of,\" he says, his quiet manner not to be mistaken for a lack of ambition.\n\nIshaq fights out of the New Era Gym in Surrey under Iqbal, one of the sport's brightest young coaches.\n\nA former professional himself, Iqbal won his lone bout in 2019 before serving a lengthy apprenticeship under the tutelage of world-class coach Adam Booth.\n\nWelterweight world champion Lewis Crocker has recently joined Iqbal's stable and the trainer says the IBF belt-holder is one of many \"elite fighters who turn their necks when Hassan is sparring\".\n\nIqbal points to the 'Philly Shell' - the shoulder-roll defence popularised by Mayweather - as the foundation of Ishaq's game.\n\nPhilly Shell is a high-IQ style built around making opponents miss by inches and punishing the mistake.\n\n\"A lot of Philly Shell fighters are purely counter-punchers and aren't very aggressive,\" Iqbal explains.\n\n\"But Hassan trusts his power. He has that defensive mindset but he can switch to offence at any moment. That's what makes him stand out.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "With the T20 World Cup beginning on Saturday, BBC Sport looks at the trends and tactics from the global game that may play a part in India and Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "It may be just 19 months since India lifted the T20 World Cup in Barbados but the latest edition begins in Colombo on Saturday.\n\nAs ever, the tournament in India and Sri Lanka will likely be one of sixes and runs.\n\nBefore it all begins, we have taken a look at what has been going on in international and franchise games over recent years and predicted some trends and tactics to watch out for...\n\nThe option for a team to call in a batter who is struggling and chewing up too many balls has always been there.\n\n2025 was the year retiring batters out hit the mainstream.\n\nThere were 26 instances of that 'dismissal' in international and domestic T20s last year - almost 50% of the total number in the history of the format.\n\nIt has also happened twice more since the turn of the year in the Big Bash, while Northern Districts retired out two batters in the same innings in New Zealand's Super Smash in January.\n\nA batter has retired out in a T20 World Cup before - in a match involving England no less - when Namibia batter Nikolaas Davin walked off to allow David Wiese to come to the middle in the 2024 group stage.\n\nBut with the stigma around the move gone, could this be the tournament of the retired out?\n\nNot since 2013 have spinners bowled as much at the death in T20s as they did in 2025.\n\nFor a long while, the death overs - regarded as the last five in an innings for this data - have been left largely to seamers and their mix of yorkers, slower balls and hard lengths. That is changing.\n\nIn 2025, 24% of balls bowled at the death in T20s between full member nations were delivered by spinners - and with some success.\n\nSpinners' economy rate at the death has dropped around 1.5 runs per over in the past two years to 7.68 runs per over. Last year, spinners had a better economy at the finish than seamers.\n\nAfghanistan, unsurprisingly given the quality of their options, have used spin regularly at the death. More than half of their deliveries in the final five overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nIndia were the next most frequent users of the tactic, followed by Sri Lanka and, interestingly, England.\n\nWhile England captain and when leading Northern Superchargers in The Hundred since 2024, Harry Brook has had spinners bowling 42.2% of his deliveries at the death.\n\nFormer captain Jos Buttler's figure in that time was just 19.7%.\n\nThis may be less of a surprise, given fast scoring and six-hitting has been on an upward trajectory since T20's inception.\n\nLast year was a big jump, however, with batting strike-rates for all players in all men's T20s tipping over 130 for the first time. The increase from 2024 was more than eight runs per 100 balls.\n\nThe introduction of the Indian Premier League's player impact rule has boosted scoring rates there - teams effectively can field an extra batter when needed - but the rise is reflected in internationals too.\n\nA six was also hit every 17.4 deliveries across all T20s last year - the figure was at 23.1 as recently as 2021.\n\nSixes are now hit more than twice as often than in the format's first year in 2003.\n\nWe are all familiar with the term match-up these days.\n\nIt has become commonplace in T20 - and increasingly in Test cricket - and describes how some batters are suited to styles of bowling and vice-versa.\n\nWhen it comes to batting against spin, the logic goes that batters are more vulnerable when facing a bowler who turns the ball away from them - a leg-spinner to right-handers and off-spinner to left-handers.\n\nWhat is interesting, however, is how all of those at the top of the T20 batting rankings, bar Australia's openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head as shown below, all have strong records against their perceived negative spin match-up.\n\nIndia's left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma, the world's leading T20 batter, averages 43.3 and strikes at 183.1 runs per 100 balls against off-spin in internationals since the start of 2024.\n\nEngland right-handers Phil Salt and Buttler have strike-rates of 148.4 and 136.8 respectively against left-arm spin alongside solid averages.\n\nThe trend is reflected by the leading spin bowlers too. India's Varun Chakravarthy, Rashid Khan and Adil Rashid all have similar records against right and left-handers.\n\nWhen it gets to the elite level, match-ups are not insignificant but they are not the be all and end all.\n\nAnother thing on the rise is the prevalence of left-handed batters.\n\nIn T20s between full member nations, lefties have never faced a higher percentages of deliveries than the 35% they did in 2025.\n\nThe spike is a sign of some teams switching on to the benefits of right-hand-left-hand batting combinations.\n\nIt makes shorter boundaries harder to defend, messes with bowlers' lengths and negates the threat of those spinning match-ups.\n\nAnd no team uses this more than co-hosts and overwhelming favourites India. It has been a cornerstone of Gautam Gambhir's time as coach.\n\nSince the start of 2024, left-handers have faced 51% of India's deliveries in T20s against full members - a jump from 31% under Rahul Dravid in the run up to the 2024 World Cup.\n\nEngland, in comparison, twice picked a team with only one left-hander in their XI during the tour of India last year.\n\nBut while left-handers only faced 19% of England's deliveries from the start of 2024 to the start of 2026, the selection of Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran for this World Cup - all of whom could bat in the top seven - suggests times may, belatedly, be changing.\n\nBut if England are to have any chance in India and Sri Lanka, it feels like Salt and Buttler, their two leading batters, will have to hit form.\n\nAfter Buttler's period at number three, the pair were reunited as openers at the end of last summer and, despite a quiet run for Salt in Sri Lanka, have returned impressive results.\n\nSalt hit scores of 141 not out, 85 and 89 against South Africa and Ireland. Buttler also made 83 against South Africa when an opening stand of 126 sent England on their way to a record 304-2.\n\nSalt, a notoriously aggressive starter, cuts loose from the start, striking at 149.7 in the first two overs of T20s since the start of 2024 - the third best of any opener at this World Cup.\n\nButtler, in comparison, has a strike-rate of just 105 in that time. He sits back and watches Salt do his thing.\n\nBut by the final two overs of the powerplay Buttler is often flying.\n\nThe former captain, having taken a bit of time to get in, has been striking at 172.9 in the fifth and sixth overs, even outdoing Salt's healthy strike-rate of 163.7.\n\nThe pair take on the powerplay in specific and complementary ways.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and  if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "fullText": "The men's T20 World Cup starts on Saturday against a backdrop of political tension.\n\nThe tournament, which features 20 teams, will be held in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nBangladesh are boycotting it after a request for their fixtures to be switched from India to Sri Lanka was refused by the sport's governing body.\n\nTheir place in Group C has been taken by Scotland.\n\nPakistan had considered boycotting but have since confirmed they will take part, though will not play their scheduled match against India.\n\nBangladesh had asked for their games to be switched from India, citing safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nRelations between the South Asian neighbours have soured since former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.\n\nIndia has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, and violent protests broke out after Sharif Osman Hadi - a prominent student leader in Bangladesh - was shot dead.\n\nIndia itself has raised concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nIn December, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in an incident that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman in January after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\n\nIn response, Bangladeshi authorities banned broadcasts of the IPL in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board then requested that their World Cup fixtures be played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - rejected that request, saying there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\" and gave the BCB a final 24 hours in which to declare their participation.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Scotland were invited to the tournament.\n\nThe ICC said it was keen not to establish \"precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events\".\n\nPakistan are boycotting their match against India, which was scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 15 February.\n\nIn a statement, the Pakistan government said it granted \"approval\" to the team's participation in the tournament but they \"shall not take to the field\" for the match against India.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi previously said the team could pull out completely after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament.\n\nPakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, and India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.\n\nPakistan did not host any touring nations between 2009 and 2019 following the Lahore attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, which killed six policemen and two civilians.\n\nPakistani players have also been banned from the IPL since 2009 following the Mumbai attacks that left 174 people - including nine gunmen - dead.\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and eventually played their matches in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt resulted in the two nations signing an agreement stating the two countries would play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.\n\nThe neighbours have fought a number of wars and had several military stand-offs since the partition of India in 1947, when the nation was split into India and the new state of Pakistan. It created an upsurge of violence, in which approximately 15 million people were displaced and an estimated one million died.\n\nRecent escalations were sparked after the neighbours engaged in a four-day military conflict in April 2025 following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC said Pakistan's stance was \"difficult to reconcile\" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\".\n\nThe governing body said that \"selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions\".\n\nIt said it \"respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy\" but continued: \"This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan.\"\n\nIt added it hoped the PCB would \"consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country\".\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is among those who have accused the ICC of mishandling the situation.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: \"It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but I stand behind my government's decision.\n\n\"This is the moment for the ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member.\"\n\nMatches between Pakistan and India can draw huge TV audiences.\n\nReportedly, more than 600 million people watched last year's Champions Trophy fixture on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar.\n\nThe ICC has not published its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face.\n\nHowever, the rules for the previous tournament stated: \"If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as match conceded or match awarded, as the case may be.\"\n\nIt is assumed India will be awarded two points for a win and Pakistan's net run-rate will also be hit by the forfeiture.\n\nPakistan face the Netherlands, USA and Namibia in their other group-stage games, and it is unclear what could happen if they were to face India in the final.\n\nTeams have pulled out of tournament fixtures before, with Australia and the West Indies both deciding not to travel to Colombo in the 1996 World Cup that was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nEngland also decided not to play their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns and social unrest in the country.\n\nNone of those nations received a subsequent fine or punishment from the ICC, though all forfeited the matches.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Bangladesh could receive other sanctions as the ICC has a precedent for punishing governments who interfere in the game.\n\nUnder article 2.4 of the ICC constitution, it outlines boards must manage their affairs \"autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of cricket\".\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe were suspended for three months after the government replaced the cricket board, leading to a freeze on funding and exclusion from World Cup qualifiers.\n\nFour years later, Sri Lanka also lost the right to host the Under-19 World Cup after its government dismissed the national board following poor performances.\n\nBoth nations later had their ICC membership restored.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?",

    "description": "BBC Sport finds evidence raising questions over the neutral eligibility of four Russian athletes.",
    "fullText": "Several Russian athletes approved to compete as neutrals at the Winter Olympics have links to activity supporting the war in Ukraine, according to evidence seen by BBC Sport.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has cleared 13 competitors, external from Russia to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Milan-Cortina.\n\nTheir eligibility was assessed by a three-person IOC panel, external, with athletes deemed ineligible if they were found to have actively supported the war, including through social media activity or participation in pro-war events.\n\nHowever, material shared with the BBC by the Molfar Intelligence Institute, external and investigative journalist Artem Khudolieiev raises questions over whether some of those approved meet the IOC's broadly-framed criteria.\n\nMeanwhile, one member of the panel - Morinari Watanabe - was filmed embracing a Russian gymnast sanctioned for his involvement with Russia's war effort during a visit to Moscow in March, prompting further questions about the vetting process.\n\nUkraine's flag-bearer for the opening ceremony believes the IOC should review its neutral eligibility framework.\n\n\"Getting ready for competition in occupied territories, or supporting the war on social media, it is definitely not right to call them neutral because they're not,\" said skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych.\n\nThe IOC said it could not comment on individual cases but that the panel had \"reviewed the athletes in accordance with the executive board decision and the principles it had established\".\n\nRussians and Belarusians cleared for Winter Olympics\n\n'Russians & Belarusians should compete in qualifiers'\n\nBBC Sport has verified the following evidence relating to four individuals cleared to compete as neutrals:\n\nPetr Gumennik (figure skating) - Gumennik has recently worked with and been coached by Ilya Averbukh, who has been sanctioned by Ukraine, external. Averbukh has held the role of 'Crimea's ambassador for sport', taken part in events in numerous occupied territories and staged performances for families of Russian soldiers.\n\nSavelii Korostelev (cross-country skiing) - Korostelev liked pro-Putin and pro-military content posted on Instagram by fellow skier Veronika Stepanova. He was also described as a \"private\" and an \"army skier\" in a 2023 article published by his club, CSKA, which is affiliated with the Russian armed forces.\n\nKseniia Korzhova (speed skating) - Korzhova liked pro-war content on Instagram from gymnast Nikita Nagorny, who has been sanctioned by the UK, external and European Union, external for his prominent role with the Russian army.\n\nDariya Nepryaeva (cross-country skiing) - Nepryaeva attended a ski team training camp in Crimea in 2022, months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 and is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The camp was filmed and broadcast by a state-backed television channel.\n\nUkraine's Olympic Committee has written to the IOC to raise concerns about Gumennik and Korzhova.\n\nNone of the athletes named responded to BBC Sport's requests for comment.\n\nRussia's Sports Minister, Mikhail Degtyarev, has previously said that \"athletes are not responsible for relations between countries or for governmental decisions and according to the Olympic Charter they should have the right to compete\".\n\nSeparate reporting, external has suggested that Korostelev may have been completing compulsory military service, rather than voluntarily joining the army.\n\nThe final decision on whether the four athletes could compete in Milan-Cortina was taken by the IOC's Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel.\n\nWatanabe sits on the panel as the representative of international sports federations, by virtue of his role as president of World Gymnastics. He was also a candidate in last year's IOC presidential election.\n\nIn March 2025, Watanabe was filmed embracing Nagorny during a visit to Moscow.\n\nNagorny, an Olympic gold medallist at the Tokyo Games, has been a prominent supporter of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nHe served as head of Yunarmiya, Russia's youth military organisation, between 2020 and 2024 and has been sanctioned by the UK, European Union and United States, external.\n\nThe UK sanctions notice accuses Nagorny of involvement in the forced deportation and re-education of Ukrainian children.\n\n\"It’s crazy,\" said Heraskevych, who held up a ‘No War’ sign at the Beijing Games.\n\n\"He's still hugging this person and still friendly with him. And then he decides whether these Russians are guilty or not guilty, whether they are engaged in the war or not.\"\n\nWorld Gymnastics, responding on behalf of Watanabe, said it would not comment on the IOC panel or its decisions.\n\nIt said Watanabe's visit to Russia \"took place a few days after he visited Ukraine\" and that its purpose \"was to show support to athletes affected by the war, on both sides\".\n\n\"Mr Nagorny has not been allowed to participate in World Gymnastics competitions since the beginning of the conflict,\" it added.\n\nDuring Watanabe's tenure as head of World Gymnastics, Russian athletes have also been allowed to return to international competition under neutral status in his sport.\n\nThat includes Angelina Melnikova, who was controversially cleared to compete last year despite previously posing with the pro-war 'Z' symbol and standing in local elections for Vladimir Putin's United Russia party.\n\nWorld Gymnastics said decisions regarding its Individual Neutral Athlete status are made \"by an independent ad hoc committee, following background checks conducted by an external company\".\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began just four days after the end of the last Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAt those Games, 209 Russians competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) because of sanctions linked to a state-sponsored doping scandal. They finished second in the medal table, winning 32 medals including five gold.\n\nSince the invasion, athletes holding Russian or Belarusian passports have been barred from many international sports competitions.\n\nBut the IOC has created a pathway for individuals to compete as neutrals, provided they meet strict criteria.\n\nThat framework was first applied at Paris 2024, where 32 competitors from Russia and Belarus took part as AINs.\n\nTo be eligible, they had to show they had not actively supported the war and were not contracted to the military. They competed without national flags or anthems.\n\nThe same conditions apply in Milan-Cortina. Thirteen Russians and seven Belarusians have been approved across eight sports. Team events such as ice hockey and curling remain off limits.\n\nThe IOC says every neutral competitor must also be cleared by their international federation.\n\nSome bodies, including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), attempted to exclude neutrals altogether but that position was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in December, a ruling that came too late for many athletes to qualify.",

    "description": "Scotland players tell BBC Sport their mental health suffered after they were told their contracts would end following the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland left the pitch following their gutsy 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat by England, for some of the squad it was a moment of pride that marked how far the team had come.\n\nFor others the full-time whistle signalled the end of an emotionally damaging tournament from which some say they are still struggling to recover.\n\nReaching the last eight was the team's best performance at a World Cup in 23 years.\n\nHowever, players have since told BBC Sport that behind the scenes Scottish Rugby's management of player contracts before the tournament left them in \"probably the worst case of mental health\" they had ever had, with one saying she suffered a breakdown as a result.\n\n\"I had an actual real-life breakdown in club to one of my coaches,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been put on medication for depression because of the impact that it's had on me.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I came back from the World Cup in a hole, a shell of myself.\"\n\nIn response, Scottish Rugby said the union was \"aware of the potential challenges players faced in their mental health during this time\" and that a package of support was put in place.\n\n\"We would not question the personal experience of an individual athlete,\" the union's response continued.\n\n\"We would, however, dispute the lack of care referenced.\"\n\nBBC Sport spoke to four players involved in the World Cup and one who was in the wider Scotland training squad. Contributors wished to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardising their future in the sport.\n\nPlayers said their contracts were due for renewal in June 2025, two months before the World Cup began in August, and that they had asked for 12-month deals beyond that to ensure job security and so they could focus on their performances at the tournament.\n\nHowever, according to those contacted, while some players in Scotland's 32-player World Cup squad were given 12-month contracts in May 2025, a quarter were told their deals would end in October, a decision one player described as a \"big shock\".\n\nAt the time, contracts ranged from £18,000 to £27,000 and in most cases were the player's main source of income. Those playing in the Premiership could also earn up to about £10,000 from their club contracts.\n\nThe players who spoke to BBC Sport said that having to compete at the World Cup knowing their jobs and international careers were potentially about to come to an end put them under huge mental strain.\n\nThey also said they were not given the proper support by Scottish Rugby to cope with the situation.\n\nSome of those who were told they would lose their funding after October had been part of the Scotland team for many years and were regularly starting international matches.\n\nOne said that \"despite clear signs\" that some were suffering with the news, \"no transitional help\" was offered by Scottish Rugby.\n\nAnother said she spent downtime between World Cup matches searching for a job.\n\nIn 2025 Scottish Rugby said it would increase the number of contracts available to players from 32 to 35 for the 2025-26 season.\n\nOne player said \"everybody understands contracts aren't going to be guaranteed every year\", before questioning why Scottish Rugby did not provide access to career advisors or psychologists for those affected.\n\nAnother added: \"It's not about contracts. It's not about resources. It's literally about treating people like human beings.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response stated that psychological support was embedded in Scotland camps and available to all players regardless of contract status.\n\nIt said a player development manager supported players on off-field matters, including employment, and that exit meetings were held at the end of contracts to identify any potential physical or psychological support that may be needed.\n\nAsked if she felt Scottish Rugby had failed in its duty of care to players, one player responded \"without a doubt\" and referenced the death of international Siobhan Cattigan aged 26 in 2021.\n\n\"How many people need to die before you take it seriously?\" she added, addressing Scottish Rugby. \"You've clearly not learned.\"\n\nCattigan's family said undetected rugby-related brain damage caused a \"catastrophic decline\" in her health and led to her death.\n\nIn 2023 Scottish Rugby said it \"let down\" Cattigan's family and chairman John McGuigan apologised \"wholeheartedly for any anguish we caused Siobhan during her time with Scottish Rugby\".\n\nMcGuigan added at the time: \"We have listened and heeded the lessons and, in Siobhan's memory, commit to making changes to ensure we are a better organisation in the future.\"\n\nAnother player said the communication of selection decisions left her \"unbelievably unwell\", adding: \"There are loads of harsh realities of elite sport: injury and non-selection. How you manage people is more important than ever.\n\n\"You can't treat people like they're just disposable, regardless of the elite sport wheel being a forever turning one.\n\n\"We still need to have empathy. And I just didn't feel like there was much at all.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response to this story said: \"We are very uncomfortable with this comparison to Siobhan's own tragic situation and the inference in any way that we were negligent in our support to her.\"\n\nPlayers told BBC Sport that the squad discussed boycotting one match during the 2025 Women's Six Nations - five months before the World Cup began - to try to reach a resolution with Scottish Rugby on its request for 12-month contracts.\n\nAll the players contacted say they were told contract decisions were based on performance and that they may still get a new contract should they perform well at the tournament, adding further pressure.\n\n\"It literally was a do or die lifeline,\" one player said.\n\n\"It's like I need to do everything I can on this rugby pitch, otherwise I'm not going to have a job and I'm going to struggle to pay my rent.\n\n\"When you're not sleeping, you don't have an appetite. You're just miserable most of the day. It's really hard to then put in a performance or do yourself justice.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response said that players were told \"on a number of occasions that their standalone playing performance at the World cup was not the sole criteria for any possible change to their contract situation\".\n\nTold her contract would end in October, one player said she was on job search websites \"most nights\" during the tournament looking for jobs \"that were appropriate\" for her life as a club rugby player.\n\nShe said: \"Before you even started a job, you're trying to bargain and speak with a new employer and be like, 'Can I finish at this time?' Because I have to actually go to my other job [club rugby training].\n\n\"Then I'm going to come in tired in the morning because I've not got into bed until midnight.\"\n\nPlayers no longer on contracts can still represent Scotland, but they now fall under the country's National Team Agreement, which offers them £75 a day, not including rest days, for attending Scotland training camps.\n\nOne player said \"she can't be involved\" for that amount, adding: \"I won't be able to afford to pay my mortgage.\"\n\nAnother player said concerns over her future took \"an emotional toll\", adding: \"I didn't want to be there. I look back on it with exhaustion. It was such a big opportunity but I have nothing but negative thoughts around it.\n\n\"[After the tournament] I removed myself from social settings, any settings where people could ask me loads about rugby.\n\n\"If I did get into that environment, I would try to remove myself as quickly as possible because it made me panic and stress.\"\n\nThe player said Scotland Rugby had not been in contact about any follow-up support.\n\n\"There's been no kind of input about, 'do you need psychology?' or anything like that,\" she said.\n\nScottish Rugby detailed the steps put in place to support players:\n\nAccess to clinical psychology and a player development manager.\n\nA mandatory medical exit meeting to \"identify any potential physical or psychological support\".\n\nAn independent HR exit interview and a six-week post-contract window to access \"exit support services\" if needed.\n\nScottish Rugby said: \"From the outset of this process we recognised that players - particularly those whose contracts were due to end - would need additional support during the Rugby World Cup period and in planning their next steps.\n\n\"We believe we did deliver on our duty of care by the provision of both psychological and career guidance support throughout 2025, including in the lead-up to and during, the RWC.\n\n\"The entire playing group were out of contract in June 2025 and we made the decision to extend all contracts through to the end of October 2025 to provide a degree of stability through the RWC itself.\n\n\"The timings involved were designed to give clarity to all players as early as possible, following a timeline agreed and requested by the players themselves.\"\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at Manchester City's evolution and why the January window has offered renewed belief.",
    "fullText": "The January transfer window has heralded encouragement at Manchester City.\n\nNot necessarily because Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi have strengthened their squad, but more that the marquee acquisitions show City are maintaining their powerbase in the transfer market.\n\nThe mere thought of transition can be enough to strike fear into any football club, particularly one that has been as successful as City in recent years.\n\nOld habits die hard when winning becomes the norm, but sometimes key decisions are taken out of your hands.\n\nAt the Etihad Stadium, there are clear signs of evolution.\n\nOn the pitch, a host of new players have arrived, while stalwarts Kevin de Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Ederson have left. In the executive team, long-serving sporting director Txiki Begiristain has departed and handed the reins to Hugo Viana.\n\nThen there's manager Pep Guardiola and the growing uncertainty over his future.\n\nIn attracting players, City have leaned heavily on the unique selling point of working with Guardiola. They can still use his aura to their advantage - but no longer to the same extent.\n\nHere, BBC Sport looks at the club's evolution and why the January window has offered renewed belief at City that change and ambiguity over their manager's future won't derail their efforts to deliver success.\n\nWhen Guardiola signed a new two-year contract in November 2024, the perceived doomsday scenario of his departure at the end of that season was prevented.\n\nAt the time, the club's greatest ever manager had just over six months left on his contract. Now there is no such urgency, with 18 months left on his deal.\n\nBut that doesn't tell the full story.\n\nThe football industry has been rife with speculation over Guardiola's future, though City's perspective is talk of him departing this year is just that - speculation.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it would be City's preference for him to stay for as long as possible. The 55-year-old continues to publicly insist he loves working at the club, and has shown no clear outward indication he is preparing to leave.\n\nBut sources have told BBC Sport there is tangible uncertainty over whether Guardiola will see out the final year of his contract.\n\nThe expectation is a decision on whether he stays will be made towards - or after - the end of this season.\n\nAnd if Guardiola does stay, it is seen as improbable that he will renew his contract.\n\nIt is fair, then, to deduce we are likely to be at the beginning of the end of his trophy-laden tenure in the blue half of Manchester.\n\nWhether that moment comes in six or 18 months remains to be seen.\n\nSemenyo and Guehi entered negotiations with their eyes open.\n\nBoth had the Premier League's elite to choose from last month.\n\nSemenyo was a target for Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham. Liverpool, too, were credited with an interest in the 26-year-old, who had a £65m release clause at Bournemouth. He prioritised a move to City.\n\nGuehi was admired on an even greater scale. Out of contract at Crystal Palace at the end of this season, the England defender had suitors across Europe.\n\nBayern Munich, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid had serious interest in signing him on a free transfer at the end of the season, while Real Madrid and Barcelona were also in the running. Liverpool's interest was well-documented. Arsenal and Tottenham also tried to convince him to agree to move across London this summer.\n\nIt is inconceivable either player decided to sign a long-term contract without knowing it is likely the majority of that time will be spent under a manager who isn't Guardiola.\n\nOf course, the opportunity to work for him - even if it is for six months - is one most players aren't afforded. But that alone is unlikely to have been enough to compel Semenyo and Guehi to sign five-and-a-half-year deals.\n\nCity can no longer lean heavily on the idea of flourishing under Guardiola in their pitches to players.\n\nAccording to sources, rival club executives have used the emerging narrative over the managerial situation to persuade players to ignore advances from the Blues - as if to suggest their success will wane once Guardiola is gone.\n\nNevertheless - certainly for Semenyo and Guehi - City's pitch remains among the most competitive around, despite the uncertainty over Guardiola.\n\nThere is no escaping the fact they are one of the best payers in Europe, and it would be disingenuous to suggest finances weren't a big factor in the two new signings.\n\nThat said, it is understood Tottenham's offer to Semenyo was the most lucrative he received last month.\n\nIndeed, sources close to both transfers say it was City demonstrating they gave a virtual guarantee of competing for the biggest trophies and consistent Champions League qualification that proved pivotal in the decision-making process.\n\nTheir state-of-the-art infrastructure and off-field ambitions are key features of their pitch to new players, but ultimately it centres on on-field success.\n\nThey impress on prospective signings the world-class squad already assembled, combined with their commitment to continue recruiting elite players.\n\nTheir strategy of extending the contracts of their best talent in search of continuity and stability also features prominently in their pitch - the 10-year contract striker Erling Haaland signed last year a case in point.\n\nBut it is City's body of work under their Abu Dhabi ownership - even prior to Guardiola's arrival - that is their truly unique selling point for prospective signings.\n\nThe trophies speak for themselves.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't some uncertainties. The implications of City's prolonged legal battle over the much-documented 115 charges in relation to alleged Premier League financial rule breaches weighs heavily over the Etihad. The club strongly deny any wrongdoing.\n\nThe outcome of the case will resonate, and any punishment may alter the landscape of English football and City's history.\n\nWhile no-one knows where the case is up to, the rebuild City have carried out over the past year suggests they are not actively preparing for the worst.\n\nRegardless of what lies ahead in that respect, they will continue to prepare the football operation for success way beyond when Guardiola is gone.\n\nFor those at City, the arrivals of Semenyo and Guehi have provided tangible proof their recruitment operations are not dependent on Guardiola's employment.\n\nAmid the ongoing changes, there remains a key constant at City.\n\nChairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak is the club's agenda-setter. The idea the Spanish triumvirate of Guardiola, Begiristain and Ferran Soriano - the club's CEO - ran the show in the absence of a distant Al Mubarak is a false narrative.\n\nHe has been, and remains, at the heart of City's operation. No big decisions are made without his input.\n\nTo that end, Al Mubarak will be at the centre of the process to appoint Guardiola's eventual replacement. Viana will lead the search - a task that will unquestionably be his most significant since his appointment as Begiristain's replacement was confirmed in October 2024.\n\nFor the successful candidate, replacing Guardiola will be an unenviable task.\n\nThat said, replacing Begiristain may have been just as daunting for Viana given his predecessor's reputation as one of the leading player-trading executives in world football.\n\nWith that in mind, those at City will tell you the move to keep Begiristain to conduct what was effectively a six-month handover to Viana until the summer of 2025 was crucial in the Portuguese's ability to hit the ground running.\n\nAccording to sources, Begiristain hand-picked Viana as his successor - a dynamic that eased the transition.\n\nThat Ruben Amorim - as manager of Manchester United - was also in town helped.\n\nThe pair - and their wives - grew close during their time working together at Sporting Lisbon, where Viana and Amorim had become two of the most sought-after non-playing commodities in European football.\n\nViana's track record at Sporting was excellent. Alongside Amorim, who he appointed, the 43-year-old helped transform them from a team stuck in malaise into one of the most dynamic in European football.\n\nThe signings of Viktor Gyokeres, Morten Hjulmand and Pedro Porro were viewed in recruitment circles as among the most economically sound.\n\nHe also sold Porro, Matheus Nunes, Joao Palhinha, Nuno Mendes and Manuel Ugarte for combined fees of more than 200m euros (£170m).\n\nOf course, City are a different beast.\n\nBegiristain and Viana worked in tandem during the 2025 January window in signing Nico Gonzalez, Abdukodir Khusanov and Omar Marmoush - something seen as hugely important in Viana's development.\n\nSimilarly, the groundwork for City's £20m capture of Guehi was started by Begiristain but executed by Viana, who is asserting his authority and personality on the club.\n\nBegiristain, Guardiola and Soriano are very close, but Viana is forging relationships with the latter two - and they are already said to be on a strong footing.\n\nThose who have worked under both Viana and Begiristain speak of similarities between them: they are unassuming in their demeanour but diligent and structured in the way they operate.\n\n\"There is a plan for everything,\" said a source.\n\nAgents have also spoken positively of their dealings with Viana, describing him as straightforward and courteous.\n\nViana is now two transfer windows into the rebuild of City's squad.\n\nDe Bruyne, Ederson and Walker all departed on his watch, and fellow stalwarts John Stones and Bernardo Silva could leave when their contracts expire in the summer.\n\nThere is uncertainty, too, over the future of Nathan Ake - and the same could be said for Manuel Akanji, Jack Grealish and Kalvin Phillips, who are all out on loan.\n\nIt is gearing up to be a busy summer window for Viana, something made trickier by it being a World Cup year.\n\nLast summer, he didn't have it all his own way. City had genuine interest in Florian Wirtz, who eventually went to Liverpool, but felt compelled to drop out of the running for the German over the total cost of the deal.\n\nWhile City maintain it was their decision, the fact they didn't sign Wirtz was felt deeply given how highly they rated the player.\n\nViana pivoted to a more economical option - Rayan Cherki, who has been a bright spark in City's season.\n\nWirtz appears to be finding his feet in England, but City will argue Cherki has had the more impressive campaign so far.\n\nThe signings of goalkeepers Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford - after Ederson's departure - were two key acquisitions, with the former's arrival seen as particularly important. Tijjani Reijnders and full-back Rayan Ait-Nouri were also important arrivals.\n\nViana will now target a new central midfielder, with Nottingham Forest's Elliott Anderson among the primary targets.\n\nThey will want further defensive reinforcements too should Stones and Ake depart, though there remain high hopes for central defender Vitor Reis - on loan at sister club Girona - with the expectation he will be integrated into City's senior squad in the not-too-distant future.\n\nWith Viana at the controls, City's transition is in full swing - and their ambitions are no longer contingent on the presence of their iconic manager.\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "With excitement rising for this year's Stade de France curtain-raiser against Ireland, BBC Sport NI looks at how France are shaping up for their Six Nations title defence.",
    "fullText": "France are the Six Nations holders. Inspirational captain Antoine Dupont is fit. They possess a beefy pack and backline of phenomenal speed and creativity. Three of their games are at home.\n\nSuch factors help explain why Les Bleus are, for many, clear favourites to defend their title and possibly lay down a marker 18 months out from the World Cup.\n\nBut much like Thursday's opponents Ireland, their preparations for the tournament have been far from serene.\n\nWith the teams named and excitement for this year's Stade de France curtain-raiser rising, BBC Sport NI looks at how France are shaping up for the latest chapter in their enthralling rivalry with Ireland and the tournament as a whole.\n\nIreland start Loughman but Lowe and Furlong out\n\n'No panic' over Ireland's injury list - Sheehan\n\nWhat impact might 'unprecedented' Six Nations schedule have?\n\nHead coach Fabien Galthie has some of the finest rugby players on the planet at his disposal, but much of the spotlight in recent weeks has been fixed on established names who will not be lining out in the French capital on Thursday.\n\nGalthie caused a stir last month when he revealed a 42-man squad without Gregory Alldritt, Gael Fickou and Damian Penaud.\n\nAll three have been big players in the Test arena in recent years.\n\nPenaud's national record haul of 40 tries in 59 caps includes four against Ireland, and while there are question marks over his defensive capabilities, it is hard to reckon with the fact that the insatiable try-scoring appetite that has often lit up the Six Nations is not currently a part of the French armoury.\n\nThe upside for France is that, with Penaud out, Theo Attissogbe starts on the right wing. The jet-heeled 21-year-old has had an injury-hit season with Pau, but he scored three tries in two Six Nations outings last year.\n\nElectrifying left winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey has scored 18 tries in 17 games this season, so even without Penaud's finishing prowess, France will be typically deadly out wide.\n\nFickou's absence robs France of a 98-cap veteran, but Galthie has a wealth of options in midfield. Bordeaux pair Yoram Moefana and Nicolas Depoortere, who start against Ireland, are 25 and 23 respectively, while Toulouse's Kalvin Gourgues is a hugely exciting option to have in reserve.\n\nGiven that Alldritt stepped in as captain for the injured Dupont last year, his absence was particularly striking. Anthony Jelonch profits from Alldritt's absence. He has not started a Six Nations game in three years and has not started at eight for France since the 2023 World Cup.\n\nBeyond the three notable omissions, Galthie is without lock Thibaud Flament, who misses Thursday's game because it clashes with his wife's fertility treatment, and veteran prop Uini Atonio, who was forced to retire with a heart problem.\n\nWith no Atonio, Galthie has turned to Dorian Aldegheri, whose solitary Six Nations start prior to Thursday came against England three years ago.\n\n\"France have an issue at prop, especially at tight-head,\" said French rugby expert Paul Eddison.\n\n\"We obviously had the shocking news about Uini Atonio and it will be interesting to see how they replace him.\n\n\"He was incredibly popular in the squad. Regis Montange started in the autumn, Tevita Tatafu was seen as the next guy coming through but has had serious injury problems. It's an area teams may look to exploit.\"\n\nIreland have a similar issue up front. Loose-heads Andrew Porter, Paddy McCarthy and Jack Boyle are all missing, while tight-head Tadhg Furlong was not risked for Thursday's opener, paving the way for a new-look front row of Jeremy Loughman, Dan Sheehan and Thomas Clarkson.\n\nWith Romain Ntamack injured, Galthie has selected Matthieu Jalibert at fly-half alongside Dupont, who returns to Test rugby after injuring his knee against Ireland last year.\n\nIt is only the second time they have been paired together from the start since the 2023 World Cup (the other being a 26-25 loss to England last year), although Dupont's Olympic commitments and injury troubles have been obstacles to progressing the partnership.\n\nJalibert has been outstanding for Bordeaux this season but he hasn't always had the easiest relationship with Galthie. In November 2024, he refused a spot on the bench after Thomas Ramos was picked at 10 against New Zealand.\n\nLast year, Jalibert was dropped after France's loss to England and did not feature in the final three Six Nations games, but his performances for the European champions this season have made overlooking him impossible.\n\n\"It's interesting with Jalibert. He's ridiculously talented and on his day is up there with the best attacking players in the world, but he and Galthie haven't always seen eye to eye,\" says Eddison.\n\n\"There's been a question in France about how to get the best out of Dupont and Jalibert together.\n\n\"I think it can work. Dupont has the all-round game, so there shouldn't really be an issue with who he is playing with. It's just important to make sure Jalibert gets plenty of ball in hand.\n\n\"There are people who think Jalibert hasn't quite done it at international level, but this is his time to shine. When he's playing well, he's a joy to watch and that can make France an even more formidable team.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old centre has broken into the Toulouse team this season, scoring eight tries in 14 games. He made his France debut off the bench against Australia in November and is on the bench for the Ireland game. Last year, he underwent surgery for a blood clot issue in his foot but now looks primed for the big stage.\n\n\"He's looked unplayable this season,\" says Eddison.\n\n\"Ball in hand he is lightning fast. He can play 10, 12, 13 or 15. He's going to be amazing.\"\n\nAlso on the bench is the 22-year-old back row who captained France to victory in the 2023 Under-20 World Championship and who already has 68 Montpellier appearances under his belt.\n\n\"Shaun Edwards has recently been speaking about how good he's been. They've been impressed with him and keen to get him involved,\" said Eddison.\n\nAnother star of the 2023 Under-20s, Depoortere has scored 14 tries in 18 games for Bordeaux and France this season. He starts alongside Bordeaux team-mate Yoram Moefana in midfield.\n\n\"A silky runner. He's been scoring tries for fun and has been playing alongside Moefana every week, so I'd expect to see a lot of him,\" said Eddison.\n\n\"This could be the year when everyone realises just how good he is.\"\n\nListen to The Ireland Rugby Social's Six Nations preview\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "fullText": "Around 2,900 athletes from more than 90 countries will compete on the ice and snow at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nThe world's biggest winter sports stars will descend on northern Italy from Friday 6 February and there's certain to be thrills, drama and breakout performances.\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the global stars and stories to look out for.\n\nJust five days before the women's downhill event takes place in Cortina, Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn announced that she had ruptured her left anterior cruciate ligament but is still hopeful that she can compete on Sunday.\n\nVonn was airlifted to hospital in Switzerland after crashing in the final World Cup race of the season but remains determined to compete in her fifth Olympics, despite the serious injury.\n\nThe veteran skier is no stranger to a comeback having retired in 2019 because of injury before undergoing partial replacement knee surgery on her right knee and returning to the sport in 2024.\n\nThe four-time overall World Cup winner is unsure whether she will be able to compete in the super-G and team events but, as a heavy favourite for the downhill gold before suffering the injury, she is determined to make the start gate at what will likely be her last Olympics.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin is the greatest alpine skier of all time and, competing at her fourth Olympics, has said she wants to \"make peace\" with the Games following disappointment in Beijing along with serious injury and mental health struggles.\n\nThe five-time overall World Cup winner has 108 World Cup wins, securing victory in the opening five slalom events of the season which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\nBut the two-time Olympic champion will be targeting a return to the podium in Cortina while her fiance Aleksander Aamodt Kilde is also on the comeback trail from a bad injury.\n\nAmerican figure skater Maxim Naumov's participation in the Milan-Cortina Games could be emotional as he makes his Olympic debut after his parents were killed in a plane crash in Washington DC last year.\n\nNaumov's dream to make Team USA was one of the last things he spoke about with his parents before they were killed.\n\nHis parents, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, skated for Russia and were world champions in pairs figure skating in 1994.\n\nSki mountaineering, or 'skimo', is making its Olympic debut at Milan-Cortina and, while Great Britain have failed to qualify an athlete in the Games' new sport, France's Emily Harrop is the next best thing.\n\nWith English parents, Harrop could have competed for Team GB but having relocated to the French Alps as a child she opted to represent France.\n\nHarrop is well placed for an Olympic medal having finished the 2025 season with seven wins out of seven races at the ski mountaineering World Cup, winning the sprint and overall crystal globe for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nDutch speed skater Jutta Leerdam will compete in the 1,000m and 500m in Milan.\n\nA former world sprint champion, Leerdam also won a silver medal in the 1,000m at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.\n\nShe is also engaged to YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, who can often be spotted at competitions and will be cheering her on from the sidelines in Italy.\n\nTeenager Finley Melville Ives arrives in Italy as one of the most exciting prospects on the freestyle skiing circuit.\n\nIves' parents are both snowboard instructors and his twin brother followed in their footsteps, but Ives opted instead for skis from a young age.\n\nHis breakout season came last year when he claimed his first World Cup victory in Calgary then weeks later became the halfpipe world champion in Engadin, Switzerland, beating Olympic greats Alex Ferreira and Nick Goepper along the way.\n\nBorn and raised in California, freestyle skier Eileen Gu was China's poster girl for Beijing 2022, where - aged 18 - she won gold in the big air and freeski halfpipe competitions and silver in the slopestyle.\n\nIn addition to her Olympic triumphs, she is also a two-time world champion and three-time Winter X Games champion.\n\nAway from the snow, Gu is one of the most famous winter sports athletes in the world and has modelled in New York, Barcelona, Paris and at Milan Fashion Week while also studying quantum physics at Stanford University.\n\nFor the first time since Sochi 2014, the National Hockey League is permitting its athletes to participate in the Winter Olympics.\n\nNHL stars did not travel to the 2018 or 2022 Games because of financial disputes and pandemic-related complications but will return to the ice this year.\n\nIn their absence, the last two men's titles have been won by Olympic teams from Russia and Finland while the United States failed to win a medal at both events, but this could be a huge boost to their hopes of returning to the podium.\n\nEight years after winning gold as a 17-year-old in Pyeongchang, American halfpipe snowboarder Chloe Kim is going for a three-peat in Italy.\n\nShe successfully defended her title in Beijing four years ago but her preparations for Milan-Cortina have been disrupted after she dislocated her shoulder at the beginning of the year.\n\nShe said in an update on Instagram she was \"good to go\" for the Games, where she will aim to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe.\n\nLegendary German bobsleigh pilot Francesco Friedrich arrives in Italy hoping to become the first man do the treble double - winning two and four-man gold for the third Games in a row.\n\nHe is a 16-time world champion across the two and four-man events while he has well over 100 World Cup podium finishes, claiming a 50th victory in the two-man earlier this year.\n\nGermany tend to dominate the Olympic bobsleigh events and the question is whether anyone can stop him from making history.\n\nCompeting at her sixth Games, Arianna Fontana is an 11-time Winter Olympic medallist and has won medals at her five previous appearances - including as a 15-year-old in Turin.\n\nTwenty years later, the short track skater is also aiming to compete in long track speed skating.\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion Fontana will also be one of Italy's flag bearers at the opening ceremony at the San Siro.\n\nNorwegian-born skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen could make history in Italy by winning a first Winter Olympics medal for a South American country after he switched allegiance to compete for his mother's home country of Brazil.\n\nThe slalom and giant slalom expert retired in 2023 having competed for Norway but returned in 2025 to represent Brazil and became the first Brazilian to finish on a World Cup podium last year before claiming the country's first victory this season to add to his five for Norway.\n\nA charismatic and deep-thinking character, Braathen says that people don't believe him when he tells them he represents Brazil in alpine skiing.\n\nAge: 18 Nation: Independent Neutral Athlete\n\nRussian skater Adeliia Petrosian is one of around 20 Russian or Belarusian athletes competing under a neutral flag in Italy.\n\nThe teenager had not competed internationally at senior level until the Olympic qualifiers because of the ban on Russian athletes but is a genuine medal contender having won the qualifying event.\n\nShe is coached by the controversial Eteri Tutberidze, who coached Kamila Valieva during the Beijing 2022 Olympics. Valieva was given a four-year ban for doping after she helped Russia to win team gold before it was then revealed she had failed a drug test before the start of the Games.\n\nIlia Malinin is the only skater to have successfully landed the quadruple Axel, skating's most difficult jump, in competition, earning him the nickname the 'Quad God'.\n\nThe American, born to Olympic figure skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, is the hot favourite for the men's singles title in Italy with previous routines including seven quads and a back flip.\n\nThe reigning world champion will be competing at his first Olympics having controversially been left out of the US team in Beijing.",

    "fullText": "The Women's Super League winter transfer window closed on Tuesday - but which club did the best business?\n\nLeague-leaders Manchester City made a statement signing, reigning champions Chelsea had a quiet one and it was a busy month for struggling West Ham and Liverpool.\n\nWe asked former internationals Steph Houghton, Ellen White, Karen Bardsley and Jen Beattie for their opinions - and you can rate each club's dealings too.\n\nEvery WSL winter window transfer\n\nWSL: Latest updates as winter transfer window set to close\n\nSitting 11 points clear at the top of the WSL, Manchester City could not have hoped for much more at this point in the season.\n\nThe club's first WSL trophy since 2016 is well within their reach but the £600,000 addition of United States midfielder Sam Coffey from Portland Thorns will give Andree Jeglertz's side an extra boost going into the final eight games of the season.\n\n\"Coffey is a very shrewd signing,\" said former City captain Houghton. \"She has international experience and is a more defensive-minded midfielder, which City didn't really have.\"\n\nAny faint hopes Chelsea had of overhauling City to claim a seventh straight title have not been helped by the lack of recruitment this month, although Houghton was not surprised.\n\n\"Chelsea have got a really good squad already,\" she said. \"They've built one for the future and have experienced players as well. It's just at this moment in time they haven't been performing to the expectations we have seen.\"\n\nAfter Sunday's humiliating defeat by City, Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor indicated she had hoped for more January signings.\n\n\"I couldn't believe that. She has the strongest team quality-wise when looking at depth and signings made,\" former Scotland defender Beattie told BBC Women's Football Weekly.\n\n\"I could not tell you what positions she is looking to fill. There are no gaps.\"\n\nSecond-placed Manchester United, meanwhile, were active early on in the window, bringing in experienced Germany striker Lea Schuller, along with Sweden's Hanna Lundkvist and Ellen Wangerheim.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about where United want to take their women's team and the signing of Lea Schuller is the answer - she is prolific,\" Houghton said.\n\n\"Defensively, they've always been solid and now they've bought a really good all-round player to strengthen their forward line. They are right in the mix.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Champions Cup winners Arsenal have also added some young Swedish talent to their squad, with Smilla Holmberg the only new arrival in north London.\n\nAs Tottenham look to continue their fine start to the season and boost their chances of European football next term, Martin Ho has added a handful of new signings to his squad - including one of the world's best young talents in Signe Gaupset.\n\n\"Martin Ho has done a really good job of propelling them into the top half of the league and making them more consistent,\" said Houghton. \"I think Spurs have been really clever this window and are going from strength to strength.\"\n\nPromoted side London City Lionesses were the busiest team in the summer transfer window but they've taken a more measured approach this time around with just one new signing - France international Delphine Cascarino.\n\n\"She's clever, quick and I like watching her play,\" Houghton said of Cascarino. \"London City did a lot of their business in the summer and now all the foundations are there for them in the WSL.\"\n\nAston Villa, meanwhile, have shown ambition in bringing in Oriane Jean-Francois from Chelsea for £450,000 and they've also signed Arsenal defender Jenna Nighswonger on loan.\n\nEverton, who sit ninth, have opted to bring in two players on loan deals, with Manchester United's Hannah Blundell and Arsenal's Laila Harbert joining for the rest of the season.\n\nMeanwhile, 10th-placed Leicester have been more active, snapping up experienced WSL players Alisha Lehmann, Ashleigh Neville, Sarah Mayling and Rachel Williams to help distance themselves from the relegation play-off spot.\n\nBut it is the bottom two clubs - West Ham and Liverpool - who have been the busiest, each bringing in six new players.\n\nUnder new boss Rita Guarino, the Irons have strengthened their defence with the additions of Estelle Cascarino and Tuva Hansen while Katie Zelem - on loan from London City - adds experience to the midfield.\n\nHowever, key defenders Anouk Denton and Amber Tysiak have left the club.\n\nStruggling at the bottom of the table, Liverpool have reinforced across their squad to try to get out of trouble.\n\nSweden goalkeeper Jennifer Falk has already become the club's number-one goalkeeper, while Republic of Ireland midfielder Denise O'Sullivan became the club's record signing.\n\nIn attack, forwards Alice Bergstrom, Anna Josendal and Aurelie Csillag have all joined on permanent deals, along with Spurs striker Martha Thomas on loan.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "John Virgo, who co-presented TV show Big Break and was a popular BBC commentator for decades, has died.",
    "fullText": "Snooker legend and BBC commentator John Virgo has died aged 79.\n\nVirgo enjoyed an 18-year professional career, winning the UK Championship and reaching the semi-finals of the World Championship in 1979.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for his post-playing career, presenting popular snooker TV show Big Break alongside comedian Jim Davidson from 1991 to 2002.\n\nFollowing his retirement from playing in 1994, Virgo became a BBC commentator.\n\nHis last commentary for the BBC came 17 days ago when Kyren Wilson beat John Higgins in the Masters final.\n\nVirgo was a popular commentator, with his famous \"where's the cue ball going?\" catchphrase when a player was close to committing a foul.\n\nPlayers and officials held a minute's silence at the World Grand Prix in Hong Kong on Wednesday.\n\nSeven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan said: \"Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away.\n\n\"Such a great mate who I loved spending time with. Absolutely gutted.\"\n\nFour-time world champion Mark Selby said: \"So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo! Such a great guy and a huge character! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.\"\n\nFormer world champion Shaun Murphy, who worked alongside Virgo for the BBC, said: \"I first met John in 1994, filming Junior Big Break. He then went on to become a friend and colleague.\n\n\"I learned so much from him whilst sharing a commentary box. The voice of snooker will be sadly missed.\"\n\nVirgo regularly took part in exhibition matches, playing trick shots and performing impressions of other players.\n\nFormer world champion Neil Robertson said: \"He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator.\n\n\"I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was.\"\n\nA World Snooker statement read: \"Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo.\"\n\nFormer world number three Neal Foulds said: \"Terribly sad news that we have lost one of the greats of snooker in John Virgo.\n\n\"JV was incredibly generous, kind and funny. He was also a wonderful player and commentator. Thanks for all the great memories JV.\"\n\nVirgo, who was born in Salford in 1946, is survived by wife Rosie and children Gary and Brooke-Leah.\n\nJohn was a tremendous competitor and a very good break-builder - brilliant among the pink and black. He knew the game inside and out and backwards.\n\nThen he transcended the sport and went into the commentary box. He did Big Break with Jim Davidson, so he became a household name to everybody.\n\nIt was that voice which was very different to everyone else and made him stand out.\n\nYou could have a right laugh with him - he loved a joke.\n\nHe had a really good act and he did impersonations of Alex Higgins, Terry Griffiths, Cliff Thorburn - and they all loved it.\n\nIt was unusual for someone to do that at the end of an exhibition, but he was absolutely brilliant at it.\n\nI'm sure when we give him a tribute at the Crucible [for the World Championship in April] they will show his impressions routine, which is just hilarious.\n\nVirgo on the Snookered podcast in 2023",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at what next for Jean-Philippe Mateta after his dream move to AC Milan broke down over issues with his medical",
    "fullText": "Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta finds himself in a difficult position as he no doubt considers what's next after a dream move to AC Milan broke down over issues with his medical.\n\nPalace manager Oliver Glasner has spoken publicly about Mateta's issues with a knee injury in recent weeks.\n\nAnd that niggle may explain the striker's poor form; he has scored just once since the start of December.\n\nThe ailment, however, didn't prevent the player from trying to force a move away from Selhurst Park during the final days of the January transfer window.\n\nBut with Mateta now stuck at Palace after two rounds of medical tests spooked Milan officials enough to pull out of a deal worth £30m, his mind will turn to the immediate future.\n\nSources have indicated to BBC Sport that Palace were up front with Milan over Mateta's knee issues, sending the Italian club full medical reports towards the end of last week in preparation for a deal being concluded.\n\nBut, according to sources in Italy, Milan's reservations were over Mateta's right knee. The 28-year-old's meniscus had ruptured in 2019 when playing for Mainz and he underwent surgery that kept him out for around six months.\n\nIn their two examinations of Mateta, the Serie A club came to the conclusion that the striker would likely require an operation to cure the problem, described as an 'inflammation' of the knee.\n\nIt is Milan's view that the issue cannot resolved by therapy and load management.\n\nThe prospect of surgery does appear the common sense approach here.\n\nIt will allow the player to continue his career free of the pain he has struggled with in recent weeks. Likewise, it would help ease any concerns his future suitors may have over his fitness ahead of any move away from Selhurst Park.\n\nIt would also suit Palace to a point as it would likely eradicate the possibility of his current knee problems arising as an obstacle towards any future sale.\n\nMateta's current deal expires in 2027 when Palace would lose him for nothing, so the prospect of selling the player this summer will certainly be considered.\n\nBut with the chance of playing in his first World Cup looming large, any surgery for Mateta may have implications towards his selection for the tournament.\n\nDepending on the timescale of recovery and rehabilitation, an operation would eat into the time Mateta has to convince France manager Didier Deschamps that he is worthy of a place for Les Bleus this summer.\n\nThe club record signing of Jorgen Strand Larsen will also impact Mateta's first-team opportunities between now and the summer, too, given the £48m outlay.\n\nMateta has scored two goals in three matches for France since his debut last year. Fulfilling his World Cup ambition is within reach but he is facing having limited minutes on the pitch for the remainder of the season as he looks to reinforce his international case.\n\nAnd that's the quandary that faces Mateta as he contends with the aftermath of his failed move to the San Siro.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League had its quietest ever winter transfer deadline day as just seven deals were completed on Monday.\n\nNot a single arrival was confirmed until 19:04 GMT - four minutes after the window in the English top flight closed - with Crystal Palace announcing the signing of striker Jorgen Strand Larsen from Wolves in a deal worth up to £48m.\n\nClubs can make signings for up to two hours after the official deadline, as long as a deal sheet is submitted before 19:00 to provide extra time for the necessary paperwork to be completed.\n\nThere were five further deals confirmed after the deadline - among them, Sunderland brought in Ecuador winger Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht in a deal worth £17.5m, while Wolves signed midfielder Angel Gomes from Marseille on loan and replaced Strand Larsen with Adam Armstrong from Wolves for £7m.\n\nThat took the overall spending in the Premier League during the winter window to more than £390m.\n\nLiverpool did agree a deal on deadline day to sign defender Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes, but that move - and the payment of the £60m fee - won't happen until the summer.\n\nAll the done deals on deadline day in one place\n\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\n\nThe day's two big talking points involved Crystal Palace - Strand Larsen's arrival from Wolves and the calling off of fellow striker Jean-Philippe Mateta's move to AC Milan because of issues with his medical.\n\nOtherwise, it was a day largely devoid of transfer drama as none of the top-six clubs did any business.\n\nOne of the more interesting moves was a Premier League exit, as former England midfielder Kalvin Phillips moved from Manchester City to Championship side Sheffield United on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nThat move comes four years after City signed Phillips from Leeds in a deal worth £45m.\n\nOther deals confirmed late on included Nottingham Forest's signing of Borussia Monchengladbach defender Luca Netz, Chelsea winger Tyrique George's move on loan to Everton for the rest of the season, while Tottenham and Arsenal both announced an academy signing.\n\nA record £3.1bn was spent by Premier League clubs in the summer - significantly more than in the winter window.\n\nThe figure of £397m for this window isn't hugely down on previous winters, with January always more low key than the summer as it is a notoriously difficult time for clubs to recruit effectively.\n\nIt is even harder to do that on deadline day, but this one was particularly quiet, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe big outlay last summer will be one, while another could relate to a new system of Financial Fair Play (FFP) that will come in from next season.\n\nSquad Cost Ratio (SCR) will replace Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), meaning overall squad costs in the Premier League from 2026-27 will have to be limited to 85% of a club's revenue.\n\n\"There's always going to be a degree of anxiety as to keeping your financial house in order ahead of a far more active market [the summer window],\" Paul Macdonald of FootballTransfers.com said.\n\n\"Clubs wanted to ensure they were in a compliant position rather than having an additional headache of being hamstrung under the new rules.\"\n\nManchester City made the biggest moves in this window as they looked to give themselves the best chance of challenging Arsenal for the Premier League title.\n\nThey signed forward Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth for £64m on 9 January, while defender Marc Guehi joined from Crystal Palace for £20m on 16 January.\n\n\"The scenario now is Manchester City are chasing down Arsenal and the points gap is getting a little bit bigger, so you need those players who are ready to go and know what the intensity of this Premier League is like,\" former England and Manchester City defender Steph Houghton told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\n\"It's been a smart move from the club in terms of getting Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo. They've slotted in really well, which is testament to them.\"\n\nCrystal Palace's deadline day move for Strand Larsen meant they spent £83m in the winter window, having signed Brennan Johnson for £35m from Tottenham.\n\nAston Villa - who are third - were the only other top-six side to pay out transfer fees during the winter window. They spent £18.25m on bringing back striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas and £10.5m on winger Alysson from Gremio.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal did no business during the winter window, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool - fourth, fifth and sixth respectively - also quiet.\n\nWhile Manchester City spent money to bolster their squad for a title fight, at the other end of the table West Ham splashed out in a bid to avoid relegation to the Championship.\n\nThe Hammers, who are third from bottom and six points adrift of safety, spent a reported £21.8m on Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente and around £25m on striker Taty Castellanos from Lazio.\n\nTottenham, who are 14th, spent £35m on signing midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid, while Bournemouth used some of their money from the Semenyo sale to sign teenage striker Rayan from Vasco da Gama for £24.7m and Hungary midfielder Alex Toth for £10.4m from Ferencvaros.\n\nDespite a quiet deadline day, Premier League clubs still spent more overall in the winter window than sides in other major European leagues.\n\nThe next-biggest spending league was Serie A, with their clubs paying out a combined £205m in transfer fees.\n\nSassuolo were one of the most active Italian clubs, paying £22m for Marseille duo Ismael Kone and Darryl Bakola.\n\nIn Spain, the transfer window closed at 22:59 GMT, but La Liga business was quiet, with Atletico Madrid's £30m deal for Ademola Lookman more than was spent be the rest of the division's clubs combined (£20.3m).\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "It is perhaps little wonder that Wrexham can feel like the centre of Welsh football given it was the birthplace of the Football Association of Wales (FAW).\n\nOn 2 February, 1876 only the third football association in the world was formed following a meeting at the town's Wynnstay Arms Hotel.\n\nLlewelyn Kendrick, a solicitor, was appointed chairman with Hawley Edwards taking the role of treasurer.\n\nA century and a half later the FAW is unrecognisable from the association established in the three story Georgian red-brick hotel that still stands in the centre of Wrexham today.\n\nBBC Sport Wales looks back at the most significant moments in the association's history.\n\n'Welsh wizard' Wilson targets Europe and World Cup\n\nA warrior touched by tragedy - Terry Yorath obituary\n\nFAW chief executive Mooney extends contract to 2030\n\nFounded three years after the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and 13 after the FA in England, the FAW is the third oldest football association in the world.\n\nSome seven weeks later - on 25 March, 1876 - the Wales men's team played their first international match, losing 4-0 away to Scotland at Partick.\n\nA year later, Scotland travelled to Wrexham and beat Wales 2-0 in their first home international at the Racecourse Ground - now named Stok Cae Ras - which remains the oldest international football stadium still in use.\n\nWales had to wait four years until 1881 for their first victory when John Vaughan scored the only goal to clinch a 1-0 win over England in Blackburn.\n\nThe 1950s marked a golden era for the Wales men's team, featuring iconic players such as John and Mel Charles, Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, Trevor Ford and Terry Medwin.\n\nWorld Cup qualification was achieved for the first time in 1958 following a defeat of Israel in a play-off.\n\nThe tournament was held in Sweden and Wales faced the hosts, Mexico and Hungary in the group stages.\n\nAll three Wales group games ended level, but Jimmy Murphy's side booked a place in the quarter-finals with a play-off win against Hungary.\n\nGoals from Allchurch and Medwin set up a tie against Brazil, but Wales would be without their talisman John Charles who was injured in the game after some ferocious treatment from the Hungarians.\n\nA 17-year-old Pele scored the only goal as Brazil won the quarter-final 1-0 but almost 70 years on Welsh football fans still wonder what might have been had Charles lined up to face Brazil.\n\nIt took more than a century for the FAW to formally recognise a women's national team.\n\nInitially established in 1973, the team received no support from the FAW as players were forced to arrange their own training sessions and matches as well as funding it themselves.\n\nA crowd of around 3,500 witnessed their first fixture against the Republic of Ireland in Llanelli, and saw Wales play in kits borrowed from Swansea City's men's team.\n\nWearing shirts several sizes too big for them, Gaynor Blackwell and Gloria O'Connell scored the side's first goals in a 3-2 defeat.\n\nTwo decades passed before the FAW would take official control of the women's side.\n\nIn 1993 players Laura McAllister, Michele Adams and Karen Jones successfully persuaded association secretary Alun Evans to finally take responsibility for the Wales women's team.\n\nConcerns over Wales' status as an independent football nation grew in the 1980s which many felt threatened the very existence of the FAW.\n\nLeading Welsh clubs competed in the English pyramid system, and the absence of a national domestic league was a source of indignation to many FIFA members.\n\nIn response, the League of Wales was formed in 1992.\n\nSome clubs, including Newport County, Merthyr Town and Colwyn Bay rejected an invitation to join and were forced to play their non-league league matches in the English system outside Wales.\n\nTwenty teams took part in the inaugural season of the new League of Wales and Cwmbran were crowned the first champions.\n\nSince 1992 the league has undergone several changes and is now known as the Cymru Premier, featuring 12 teams.\n\nThe New Saints are the competition's most successful club and have won the title on 17 occasions.\n\nThe summer of 2016 is immortalised in Welsh football folklore.\n\nWales had not qualified for a major international tournament since the World Cup of 1958 in Sweden.\n\nEuro 2016 in France gave a squad dubbed the 'golden generation' an opportunity to shine on the international stage.\n\nStars such as Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams led a squad of players to the summer of their lives.\n\nWales topped a group containing Slovakia, England and Russia, before beating Northern Ireland in Paris in the last 16.\n\nIn the quarter-finals they faced one of the tournament favourites, Belgium, in Lille.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu scored one of the most iconic goals in Wales' history in a 3-1 win that ranks as one of the best results in the 150 year history of Welsh international football.\n\nWithout the suspended Ramsey and Ben Davies, Wales were beaten by eventual Euro 2016 winners Portugal.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the semi-final in Lyon, but Euro 2016 remains a defining chapter for the national side.\n\nQualification for Euro 2025 marked a landmark moment for women's football in Wales.\n\nHead coach Rhian Wilkinson and her players secured their place in Welsh footballing history by reaching a major international tournament finals for the first time.\n\nThe tournament was held in Switzerland and Wales faced world class opponents in the group stage.\n\nHeavy defeats to the Netherlands, France and England on the pitch were countered by some unforgettable moments including the singing of the national anthem before the opening match against the Netherlands, Jess Fishlock's goal against France and the passionate support of the Red Wall.\n\nThe hope now is that Euro 2025 will inspire more girls and women to take up the sport in Wales.\n\nEarly signs are encouraging, with more than 20,000 girls and women now registered to play football.\n\nThe next target is qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup, as Wales look to add another memorable chapter to the story of the national team.\n\n'World Cup could earn millions for Welsh grassroots'\n\n'We have so much to thank Terry for' - Bellamy\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying",

    "fullText": "Transfer deadline day has become an event for fans and something of a media circus in recent years, but it has always been an important day for managers, even before the current system of having transfer windows was introduced in 2002.\n\nGet it right - and get the player or players you want in at the 11th hour - and you can turn your season around.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't get important deals done or lose someone without replacing them, it can take the wind out of your sails and deflate a team involved in a promotion bid or survival battle.\n\nI never saw making late signings as a risk, because I always thought the players I was bringing in would make the team better.\n\nLooking back at the transfer deadline day deals I was involved in was really interesting. Yes, I had a few stinkers, but also some really good ones. A theme emerged which showed that if you can do good business, it can really change the fortunes of the team.\n\nAt Crystal Palace on the final day of the January window in 2014, for example, the permanent additions of Scott Dann, Wayne Hennessey, Joe Ledley and also Tom Ince on loan, sparked an amazing turnaround.\n\nWe were in a relegation battle and in serious trouble near the bottom of the Premier League when they arrived but we ended up 11th, 12 points clear of the bottom three, after securing our survival with three games to go.\n\nAll four new players were great positives who played a huge part in our improvement. I am not saying they upgraded the quality of our players but they gave us a better balance as a team, which I felt we lacked before they came in.\n\nGaining that balance enabled us to stay in the Premier League.",

(Photo by Chris Lee/Chelsea FC\n\nAnselmino is set to join Strasbourg on loan as his replacement, but BBC Sport have reported Chelsea are not ruling out deals for a midfielder and attacker before Monday’s 7pm deadline.\n\nThe Blues made an initial enquiry for Douglas Luiz, but the Brazil international ended up rejoining Aston Villa on loan.\n\nIn terms of attackers there’s been no real links this window, but Chelsea could pull an unexpected move out of the bag, and do need cover for Cole Palmer following the departure of Facundo Buonanotte.\n\nWhilst the Blues are still looking to bring players in, they are also working on the departures of Tyrique George and Axel Disasi.\n\nGeorge is reportedly close to joining Everton on loan with an option to buy, but several other clubs are also interested in his services.\n\nBBC Sport share interesting Chelsea transfer update with deadline day looming\n\n“This is why” – Fabrizio Romano reveals reason behind controversial Chelsea transfer decision\n\nReport: Chelsea player suffers injury setback and will miss next six weeks\n\nDisasi was reportedly close to joining West Ham on loan, but AC Milan have entered the race, whilst Lyon and Roma are also said to be interested.\n\nIdeally they need to find solutions for both players, as them staying for another six months doesn’t work well for anyone.",

    "fullText": "Rafaela Pimenta has never scored a goal or managed a team. But the 53-year-old is the only football entry in Forbes' '50 over 50' list for 2026.\n\nEvery January, the global media company publishes the 50 women who have reached a position of status and influence that makes them beacons for others to follow.\n\nOscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz is there, so too Dame Sarah Mullally - the first female Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nAs football's first female super agent, Brazilian Pimenta is hugely influential.\n\nHer impressive stable of clients includes Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, Liverpool manager Arne Slot and 17-year-old Mexican wonderkid Gilberto Mora.\n\nShe radiates warmness as she arrives on time to speak exclusively to BBC Sport. Once the cameras are rolling, Pimenta is deadly serious as she covers a range of topics, including the treatment of women in football.\n\nBut, on the eve of deadline day, let's start with her concerns about the present transfer system.\n\n\"There needs to be a change,\" she explains. \"There's too much power for clubs.\n\n\"Players are sometimes hostages of situations. I'm not fighting for chaos. We need the transfer system for the whole thing to work. But we need more balance.\n\n\"We are in a transfer window, and I can bet you, because I see it at the end of every window, somebody will cry. There's always a player crying because he could have gone, needed to go and a club said they want £1m more.\"\n\nIn October 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) found rules implemented by world governing body Fifa, which govern the way some football transfers work, break European Union laws.\n\nFifa subsequently introduced an interim framework based on the calculation of compensation payable and burden of proof if there is a breach of contract.\n\n\"Football used to be more human,\" Pimenta adds. \"A football director or an owner would have a special relationship with the player. If a player went to them and said 'please, I need to go', they would find a solution.\n\n\"Today, football is becoming so much of a business there is a risk that players become an asset on the balance sheet. An asset has no voice, no feelings, no human needs.\n\n\"The challenge is to find a balance between the asset and the human being.\"",

    "fullText": "In BBC Sport's Eat & Yap series, Alex Scott meets some of the best WSL players to share the food they love and to chat about life on and off the pitch.\n\nWatch the interview in full now on BBC iPlayer\n\nKerstin Casparij has been setting the pace down the flanks for league leaders Manchester City all season.\n\nOn the latest episode of Eat & Yap, while teaching Alex Scott how to create the Dutch delicacy oliebollen, she reveals how she ended up with a cat tattoo, why her girlfriend thought she was a gardener and why team-mate Vivianne Miedema causes her to swear in Dutch.\n\nAlex: OK, so talk to me, what's on the menu.\n\nKerstin: All right, so you'll see a massive pan of oil, which I know doesn't look too nice, but I've been able to prep some butter and this is for a snack called oliebollen.\n\nAlex: So this is a bit of home?\n\nKerstin: It is very Dutch and we only have them around New Year's. You can only get the packaging around New Year's as well. Don't look at the calories actually, because that's why we don't have them all year round!\n\nAlex: Some recipes had currants and raisins for this...\n\nKerstin: I don't like the raisins!\n\nAlex: We're on the same wavelength there! I'll warn you, I'm not very good at hiding things if I don't like them.\n\nKerstin: Alex, I'm Dutch. Do I look like the type that hides it?\n\nAlex: Talk to me a bit more about life at home because you grew up in what, a remote part of the Netherlands?\n\nKerstin: So I'm a northern girl. I'm from a province called the Friesland and I'm very lucky that I grew up in a small town where a lot of sports are available. Playing was like a two-minute walk from where I used to live, which was perfect.\n\nAlex: I feel like it was always definite you were going to go on and be an athlete then?\n\nKerstin: Well, my parents met both playing for the Dutch national team and they both did judo, so there was no choice other for us than to do sports.\n\nAlex: How did the people back home describe you back then?\n\nKerstin: People mostly described me as loud, very chatty - I'm raging ADHD. I've calmed down a little bit now but as a child I was all over the shop. It was such a good thing, growing up and wanting to become an athlete, because I was so hyper-focused on football.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's hard to navigate, so how did you do that?\n\nKerstin: At that time I was really struggling to keep up in school, to get ready for tests and also do all my football. Once I had the diagnosis, I was speaking to psychologists and my parents were very supportive. It takes time and I still have a lot of things to learn about myself.\n\nAlex: Would you say Manchester feels like home for you now?\n\nKerstin: Definitely. I think the people here are so nice. That's one of the things I heard when I was going to join. I live here with my girlfriend - we've got our cats.\n\nAlex: So you met your girlfriend in Manchester?\n\nKerstin: We met on Tinder in Manchester. It was great for me because I was a bit lonely, living on my own and I was just excited to meet other people outside my team-mates. I love my team-mates but sometimes you want to see other people as well.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's the part that's hard to explain. Yes, you are fully immersed in football but it's equally as important to have other hobbies.\n\nKerstin: My girlfriend always says: 'You've got such a football perspective' and also just work-life balance. It's so different than she has, working nine to five and being off at weekends. Your work is not your life, not your personality and it doesn't define who you are. Being able to see that side of it and her allowing me to step away is really nice.\n\nAlex: You said you met on Tinder?\n\nKerstin: Yeah and to be fair, I was debating whether to go on Tinder. This was at the point in my career where I wasn't that known.\n\nAlex: Did I read you didn't put any photos up on Tinder of you in football kit?\n\nKerstin: I didn't put any bio - I didn't put any pictures of football. So Ruth had no idea that I was even sporty. She thought I was a gardener because I was tanned… She had no idea about football so it was fun to introduce her to the world and now she's a massive fan. She knows all the gossip! Sometimes she comes home and she tells me these things and I'm like: 'How do you know this?'\n\nAlex: So you've got Ruth, and now two cats?\n\nKerstin: Kiwi and Mango. Both fruits. I got Kiwi because I was on my own and I was very lonely. Then I met Ruth a couple of months later and we're both away quite a lot so we thought we should get Kiwi a brother.\n\nAlex: And next level, you have a tattoo.\n\nKerstin: Yes, I've got a tattoo of them. Should I show you? I've got a tattoo of them looking into a wine glass just because they're cute and silly.\n\nAlex: Are you fully immersed in Manc life? What kind of slang words?\n\nKerstin: I kinda just copy everyone else.\n\nAlex: What about when you're back with the Dutch team?\n\nKerstin: I definitely struggle having to switch to Dutch again, like finding the words because I only speak Dutch with my mum.\n\nAlex: What are the team meetings like in Manchester City then? Is it fully English or do you have translators?\n\nKerstin: It's all English. I know some that do struggle a little bit and when they have a meeting with the coach, they do have a translator to make sure they're being heard. To be fair, team meetings are really good. Andree [Jeglertz] really made a point about it being really open. We're all in a massive circle rather than an auditorium so when you speak you can actually look directly at each other. We really work together and everybody has a voice.\n\nAlex: You do team bonding stuff?\n\nKerstin: We've made it a very big thing to have a lot of team activities this year. So I'm captain of the team activity crew together with Laura Coombs. We went to Crystal Maze the other day with players and staff, which we've made a big thing. We want to get together with the staff as well, just to get that connection.\n\nAlex: It's how they know you away from the field as well.\n\nKerstin: Yeah, exactly. More of your personality. Sometimes it can be a bit of a step to approach someone in a leadership role and to get everybody together and just do something fun away from the club in your own clothes creates such a nice bond. You actually have conversations that you might not have at the club.\n\nAlex: I think you've done a cooking class didn't you? How did that go?\n\nKerstin: It was a success - it was Italian dishes. Some people made amazing risotto, they were getting the lemon in and it looked unreal. Some people burned it and some people were screaming that it was sticking to the pan.\n\nAlex: Come on, name names. Who's the bad cook?\n\nKerstin: I'm not going to expose my team-mates.\n\nAlex: Let's talk about temptations and cravings, because people are starting to talk about Manchester City potentially lifting the WSL trophy this season. Are you believing? Why are you laughing at me?\n\nKerstin: I mean, it's kind of funny because we were in such an underdog position going into this season. I felt like everybody was talking about Chelsea, Arsenal, [Manchester] United. It was kind of nice being left out of the conversation and I think we really took that as motivation.\n\nAlex: What do you think has changed?\n\nKerstin: It's little tweaks that matter the most, and also Andree's playing style. We get so much freedom, and also trust and responsibility. Previously it was a good system but a bit robotic at times. We do all the analysis and he gives us everything we need but if something's a bit different, he can't change that from the side. Leaving that space allows us to be adaptable on the pitch.\n\nAlex: What do you put your form down to?\n\nKerstin: I've got such a strong desire to show everybody what I can do and be the best that I can be. I'm really enjoying our offensive style of play this year and linking up with Bunny [Shaw] and Kerolin and all the other incredible forwards that we have. It's just been a joy to work. I go every day with a smile on my face.\n\nAlex: I've always wanted to learn about different cultures and I suppose you have that at Manchester City?\n\nKerstin: That's one of the things I love about football in general. We travel to these amazing places, but also my team-mates are from many different continents and cultures. It's been an eye-opener because I'm from a northern town in the Netherlands. We didn't have a lot of diversity growing up, so meeting these incredible people has been really inspiring.\n\nAlex: There are some cheeky elements to your game, which I absolutely love. Is this you trying to put the opposition off?\n\nKerstin: To be fair, I'm a bit annoying when I'm marking, like trying to push away. I'm not the tallest, I'm not the best at heading so I'm a blocker. Just be the annoying little fly, the little mosquito that doesn't let them head the ball.\n\nAlex: You've now got Dutch team-mate Vivianne Miedama at the club - what's it like having her at club level?\n\nKerstin: She's a fantastic player. In training, it looks so easy and she looks like she's putting in minimum effort and she bangs it into top bins. I swear at her in Dutch - no-one knows what I'm saying! She's such a good player to have with all her experience. A little bit of Dutchness can do wonders.\n\nWatch: Manchester City v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Sunday, 1 February (14:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

It said in an X post that it “appears to be Alex Pretti interacting with federal immigration agents” and that it had the clip analyzed by the BBC, “whose facial recognition technology confirmed his identify to a 97% degree of accuracy.”\n\nThe BBC confirmed the authenticity of the video in their 10 p.m. GMT news broadcast. Reporter Ros Atkins said the man in the video “has the same coat, facial hair and gait as Alex Pretti and a facial recognition tool suggests a 97% match. We see him shouting abuse at the agents.” Separately, a spokesperson for the BBC confirmed to Mediaite that they reviewed the footage and verified its team did use facial recognition technology on the video.\n\nYou can watch the BBC footage below, or watch the footage on their website (the relevant portion begins at the :50 mark):\n\nCNN, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, and other outlets have also now confirmed with the Pretti family that the man in the video is Alex Pretti.\n\nA narrator for the video said TNM’s team — comprised of reporters Dallin Mello and Dan Ming — received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street in Minneapolis around 10:15 a.m. When they arrived, they recorded a man who looked like Pretti spitting on a Ford SUV and shouting at immigration agents that they were  “f*cking trash!”\n\nThe man who looked like Pretti was wearing a black hat, brown coat, and had a beard; the narrator noted it was similar to the outfit Pretti wore when he was killed on January 24. He then smashed the right tail light by kicking it two times and flipped the middle finger at the vehicle.\n\nAt that point, “An agent then got out of the vehicle, grabbed him, and pushed him to the ground,” the voiceover said.\n\nThe man who appeared to be Pretti could be seen trying to scurry away from one agent before another agent grabbed him and they both threw him down.\n\n“During the altercation, agents fired tear gas and pepper balls into the crowd,” the narrator continued. “They continued to hold the man down before they retreat and he walks away.”\n\nThe narrator said there appears to be a gun “visible above his waistband” in the footage.\n\nWe were filming a documentary about ICE activity in Minneapolis when we received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street, and captured this footage.\n\nReporting by @danming, Dallin Mello, and BBC Verify.https://t.co/sZcpUBQOpr\n\n— The News Movement (@thenewsmovement) January 28, 2026\n\nThe footage quickly went viral on X shortly after it was posted on Wednesday. Republican communications adviser Steve Guest posted the clip and it pulled in 1.4 million views in its first two hours. He incorrectly said it was a “bombshell report from the BBC” — a mistake several other users made.\n\n“Important context: Pretti was not a peaceful protester,” Guest added.\n\nMUST WATCH: Footage of an a man who looks like Alex Pretti with a gun in his waistband, spitting on and attacking federal law enforcement officers and kicking the tail light of their vehicle on January 13.\n\nImportant context: Pretti was not a… pic.twitter.com/snzEO8rU8w\n\n— Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) January 28, 2026\n\nGreg Price — who lists “Rapid Response Manager” for President Donald Trump’s White House as one of his jobs on LinkedIn — also shared the clip.\n\n“Alex Pretti spits on a federal agent and then kicks out his taillight in footage released by the BBC from 11 days before his death,” he posted.\n\nAlex Pretti spits on a federal agent and then kicks out his taillight in footage released by the BBC from 11 days before his death.pic.twitter.com/64hg4FXv1a\n\n— Greg Price (@greg_price11) January 28, 2026\n\nMegyn Kelly shared the clip and said it showed Pretti had been “itching for another confrontation with Border Patrol, whom he’d been stalking, harassing and terrorizing.”\n\nShe continued, “HE had been victimizing THEM. His felonies are on tape. He was reckless, and it cost him his life. Find another post boy, illegal-loving Leftists.”\n\nAlex Pretti was itching for another confrontation with Border Patrol, whom he’d been stalking, harassing and terrorizing.

Wicketkeepers under the age of 18 also have to wear a helmet when standing up to the stumps.\n\n\"The cricket ball can cause significant injury and it is extremely important that players take the appropriate precautions when batting, keeping wicket or fielding close to the stumps,\" said ECB chief medical officer Dr Nick Peirce when the regulations were introduced in 2015.\n\nThe ECB also advises players to wear neck protectors, but they are not mandatory. In Australia they have been compulsory for all batters facing fast or medium pace in Cricket Australia competitions since the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe regulation was brought in following the death of Phillip Hughes in 2014.\n\nHughes was struck on the top of the neck by a ball during a Sheffield Shield match in Sydney.\n\nHe collapsed and was taken to hospital, where he died two days later.\n\nThe neck protectors attach to helmets to provide extra protection at the back of the head and neck.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhat is Curran's ultra-slow 'moon ball?'\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?\n\nWhat difference does grass make to a cricket pitch?",

    "fullText": "Scotland are confident visa issues will not delay their players' arrival at the men's T20 World Cup as chief executive Trudy Lindblade detailed the frantic preparations involved in their \"unique\" last-minute tournament plans.\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) brought in Scotland to replace Bangladesh on Saturday, with the event set to start on 7 February.\n\nIt came after the ICC rejected a request from Bangladesh to move their games from India to Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament. Bangladesh had cited safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nScotland were given the spot courtesy of being the highest-ranked team - in 14th - not already at the event.\n\nCricket Scotland officials have been working around the clock since Lindblade picked up a call from ICC chief executive Sanjog Gupta at the start of last weekend.\n\nThere is still a tight turnaround to get all of their players, including seamer Safyaan Sharif who has Pakistani heritage, visas in time to enter India.\n\n\"We're absolutely delighted to have been invited, but it is certainly in unique and challenging circumstances,\" Lindblade told BBC Stumped.\n\n\"We're all confident at the moment we can get everybody out there.\"\n\nScotland are hoping to bring on board a major sponsor and are optimistic a new playing kit for the tournament will arrive before they leave.\n\n\"If we've got kits, that's a bonus. If not, you might see us in our regular Cricket Scotland playing kits,\" Lindblade said.\n\n\"We've got seven days to turn around a sponsor.\"\n\nScotland have effectively inherited Bangladesh's itinerary for the World Cup and will initially be based in Bengaluru.\n\nThey are expected to play warm-up matches against Afghanistan and Namibia on 2 and 4 February at the Board of Control for Cricket in India centre of excellence in nearby Singahalli.\n\nScotland are scheduled to play West Indies on the opening day of the tournament at Eden Gardens in Kolkata and do not envisage that fixture being pushed back at this stage.\n\n\"I think if we were getting worried, we would certainly talk to the ICC about what options are available to us,\" Lindblade added.",

But football is a results business, we all know that, and we have to get back to him and help him quickly to find a solution.\"\n\nWhen pressed about his backing for Cifuentes, the owner added: \"I hope to talk and will assess with him, and the whole club together, and then hope we can find a solution.\"",

Women's players have been allowed to use them by the WTA since 2021.\n\nBut health analytical devices, known as wearables, are not currently permitted at Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n\"Athletes have a fundamental right to understand their own performance and health - including during competition at events like the Australian Open,\" said Whoop, the brand worn by Alcaraz.\n\n\"Blocking access to personal health data does not protect sport.\"\n\nThe Australian Open says it is \"involved in ongoing discussions\" about players wearing the devices in future. But it is unclear why they are not allowed now.\n\nWhoop founder Will Ahmed described the Alcaraz decision as \"ridiculous\" in a post on X, adding: \"Let the athletes measure their bodies.\"",

He was an unused substitute in four of those matches.\n\nThe England international was signed from Crystal Palace in August for £67m to add creativity to Arsenal's attack - he shoots freely, while his ability to open a defence in a flash means he adds an element of flair to the forward line that not many others in the squad have.\n\nThat makes the fact that he played just over 10 minutes in each of the recent 0-0 draws with Nottingham Forest and Liverpool, when Arsenal did not allow either of those teams to have a shot on target, even stranger.\n\nIf Eze is not allowed to showcase his ability when Arsenal need a breakthrough, the questions about where he fits into Mikel Arteta's team will keep coming.",

    "fullText": "There has been open criticism of Michael Carrick's backroom staff appointments at Manchester United, which is one of the most important issues any manager has to address when joining a new club.\n\nUsing my experience of that situation, I want to try to explain his thinking with the people he has brought in since he was named interim head coach, and how I believe what he has done can only be viewed as sensible. It's certainly a long way removed from the accusation that he has just brought in a bunch of his mates.\n\nMichael's aim at United is the same as every manager when you first arrive in a job. You want to establish quickly a clear and defined alignment between yourself and the different football departments within the organisation that you have just inherited.\n\nYou have to be clear on your objectives and set certain principles in the first few days - like a work ethic, for example - that are non-negotiable and must be made absolutely clear to players and staff members who have not worked with you before.\n\nBuilding a strong base with everyone pulling in the same direction takes time and, initially, it can lead to some forms of confrontation with existing members of the playing and coaching staff.\n\nTo be absolutely clear in communicating your intended direction for the club, I believe the manager has to appoint his own members of staff. I always wanted to bring in people I could trust and who were competent in the responsibilities I would delegate to them.\n\nA manager's job is fraught with pressures and if the most important aspects are not prioritised, the amount of work needed in other areas of the club can become a drain on his ability to perform, on game days or away from those match situations.\n\nThis is where your backroom staff is all-important, and it is the same at every club.\n\nI am sure Michael understands that winning games is the be-all and end-all of what supporters want but, behind the scenes, work has to be performed to generate a togetherness and belief in a way that will produce those winning performances.",

They literally had wires going up my groin into my heart and they were trying to induce palpitations.\n\n\"Then they had to basically burn off an external circuit in my heart to basically fix my heart.\"\n\nThe experience fortified Bukauskas. He would push himself to the limit in training, and a two-year spell playing basketball in Louisiana resulted in him being on the verge of fainting during sessions in 40-degree Celsius heat.\n\nHe was already a British kickboxing champion by the time he had the heart operation, with the palpitations having had him worried.\n\n\"It was very dangerous. I was lucky it never happened in any of my kickboxing fights,\" says Bukauskas.\n\n\"But I think that was a little starting point as to all the hardships I'd have to go through.\n\n\"That was the first steps to being able to overcome anything else that came later on in life.\"\n\nNow aged 31, Bukauskas faces the most important fight of his sporting life when he takes on Nikita Krylov on Saturday evening at UFC 324.",

    "fullText": "Editor’s note: This article contains spoilers for each series of the UK and U.S. editions of The Traitors\n\nThe winner of the fourth series of Traitors UK will not be the psychologist, either of the two barristers — one turned bestselling crime author — or the retired police detective.\n\nThe wild irony of The Traitors, the final of which will be aired on the BBC this evening, is that a social deduction game based around reading people, gathering evidence, and presenting a case never seems to favour people who have spent a career building those skills.\n\nThe aforementioned detective got the whole thing so spectacularly wrong that the only player she pledged her trust to was a traitor.\n\nHow can you look away? Almost 12 million people watched the series four premiere in the UK this month, and the U.S. fourth season has already beaten the premiere of season three. Outwardly, Traitors is a game of deception — the titular ‘traitors’ must eliminate the ‘faithfuls’, by murder and manipulation, while faithfuls must hunt out the traitors and vote to banish them — but it is really a proving ground for every soft skill ever listed on LinkedIn.\n\nEach year, contestants from scores of different industries — diplomacy, medicine, politics, military, teaching — profess theirs has equipped them best to succeed on a show which offers a cash prize to the winning contestant. Which raises the question: how well would football prepare you for the Traitors?\n\nThere are parallels between both, according to Traitors UK series one contestant Dr Amos Ogunkoya, a GP and sports medicine doctor who was previously the club doctor at Luton Town (then in the Premier League) and Colchester United.\n\n“When you’re in the castle, there’s so much noise,” he told The Athletic. “Everyone is throwing out theories. (The edit) focuses on one or two, but there are 10, 30, 50 every day.\n\n“You have to trust your gut a lot more. When you’re working in the Premier League, I can’t explain to you how much noise there is. It’s global noise, and inside, everyone’s got people in their ear. Comfort in that noise and comfort in who you are is really important.\n\n“Football environments are difficult things because, especially at the higher level, they induce — quite similar to The Traitors — a level of paranoia. For a lot of people at the top level, there’s a lot of competition: is (there) someone else in the shadows that wants to take that position from you? The people who rise to the top tend to be the people whom people like.\n\n“The best faithfuls are the ones who adopt the siege mentality. It’s almost like a relegation scrap: ‘We know who we are, and everyone thinks we’re stupid, and everyone thinks we’re gonna go down’. That’s the best way you quickly suss out who’s on your side. I probably got murdered because I was (valuing) cohesion and leadership.”\n\nSuch is the cruelty of The Traitors, the game does not always reward those players the audience perceives as having worked the hardest.\n\nContestants must constantly walk the tightrope between self-preservation and confrontation. Some, like faithful Harriet in UK series 4, swiftly go in two-footed with their accusations, while others hide their suspicions from the traitors to stay in the game. That exercise in diplomacy — how and when to speak — takes place every day in dressing rooms up and down the country.\n\n“Sometimes, there’s no other option other than to go for someone and really say: ‘That’s not on, you’re not behaving in the right way’,” said Wales Women centurion Helen Ward, now head of women’s football at Watford. “You have to bring it up, particularly if you are captain or head coach. You’ve got a responsibility to the rest of the group to call it out.\n\n“I’ve really been lucky to have some brilliant team-mates, but there’s always the occasion where you think: what are they doing behind my back? If it’s another striker, are they trying to bring me down to other people to make themselves look better?\n\n“There’s competition for places, but then there’s being a little bit sneaky about it.\n\n“You know they’re doing things to elevate their own career, and that maybe comes with some behaviours that not everybody would necessarily agree with or do themselves. That certainly would come up from time to time in teams. If you’ve been around that and you’ve picked up on things that people do when they think no one’s watching, that could be a trait that lends itself well to solving The Traitors.”\n\nJake Brown, winner of UK series three, attributed his victory in part to skills gained as a Para Lion with the England cerebral palsy football team. Brown represented England at European and world championships and trained at England’s base at St George’s Park in Staffordshire. That ingrained consistency was crucial in the show, he said.\n\n“If you change your behaviour or character a lot, that’s often seen as traitor behaviour,” he said. “I always used to think: one day, be loud; one day, be quiet. I was trying to get that see-saw balance.\n\n“One of my managers at England used to tell me: ‘KISS — Keep it simple, stupid’. I took that saying into the castle with me. The first couple of days: don’t do anything complicated. Normally, the first thing you think about is the best. That saying goes on the football pitch: the first pass or the first action you see is normally the best course of action.\n\n“When people start to get banished and murdered, that’s when you need to think outside the box, and think a couple of days ahead. If I say this, how will people react? If you’re saying something without a long-term goal in mind, you might get caught out.”\n\nCoaches and managers, of course, must be alert to the moment the courage of their convictions tips into delusion. By the same token, the most galling reverse came in the UK final of The Celebrity Traitors. Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed formed an early alliance with former England rugby union player Joe Marler based on their shared suspicions of comedian and traitor Alan Carr, only to falter and banish Marler at the final round table in favour of Carr.\n\n“My jaw dropped when that happened,” said Jay Sadler, the head coach of WSL 2 side Portsmouth Women. “I couldn’t believe he changed and switched on someone that he formed an alliance with.\n\n“Elite managers have that strength in their convictions and they know exactly what they’re chasing. Sometimes, you look and think, do we stick? Do we need to have more adaptability to win? I’d rather look back and be glad I made a bold move that I felt strategically was the right one than stick with the same, hoping for a different result.\n\n“The difference is I’ve got a multidisciplinary team that I can lean on — analysts and assistant coaches that I know are here for the right reasons. Can you trust everyone on The Traitors? That’s why I think you have to be a little bit more cut-throat with sticking to your own game and your own guns than in football. If you are going off limited information, stick to what you know and stick to your gut.”\n\nThe most galling example of misplaced trust came in the UK series two finale, when disability model Mollie Pearce’s friendship with traitor and eventual winner Harry Clark won out over a more logical alliance with faithful Jaz Singh.\n\n“The interesting thing is they all think, after being together for three or four days, that they know each other inside out,” said Stephen Warnock, the former Liverpool and Blackburn defender turned BBC and Sky pundit.\n\n“You haven’t got a clue who you’re talking to, but people do get blinkers on and forget it’s a game. That’s the one thing that footballers would definitely remember, and I think they’d be quite cut-throat if it meant axing someone or calling someone out. The other side of it is if you had someone who is an ex-captain or a senior player going into the Traitors, they could be seen as a little bit bossy, commanding and trying to lead people. That could be seen as a positive or a negative.”\n\nWarnock pointed out that footballers may have years together compared to the weeks Traitors contestants spend in the Scottish castle. That makes for a more delicate and significant balancing of emotions. Equally, football coaches tread a constant line: building an honest environment while protecting the group, which sometimes necessitates a kind of deception.\n\n“What I’ve learned now is that football management is a bit like acting,” continued Sadler. “You’re going up in front of the cameras and the media want to talk to you, but you already know what you want to tell them — you just manipulate whatever questions are asked and give the answer that you want to portray to the players, staff, and stakeholders.\n\n“The biggest thing in leadership is being honest and being able to build trust. Deception kind of conflicts with that. (In the game), the balance will be key.”\n\nIt is rare that a post-game interview will be as confrontational as a Traitors roundtable, but journalists must be able to ask the hard questions while preserving long-term relationships.\n\n“With football, you know it is just a game, but when it starts getting nasty, or things aren’t going their way, (managers) are still people, so it’s a fine line to tread,” said Sky Sports presenter Michelle Owen.\n\n“(With) The Traitors, I can’t believe this year how there have been so many things (discussed at the roundtable) and then the next day, no one mentions them. You need to bank stuff in your memory. In our job, those little things are so important.”\n\nUltimately, though, The Traitors remains such a difficult show to navigate. Everyone thinks they’re good at reading people until somebody proves them wrong — a bad business partner, a dishonest spouse — and those instincts are tested in a game whose premise often feels illogical.\n\n“You have to be comfortable being wrong,” said Ogunkoya, which sums up the irony of the game. “In any professional sport, you make mistakes, adjust and you don’t have an ego when it comes to it. People can go in (the show) and think they’re good at reading people, become really rigid, and that makes them easy to trick.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSoccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa are monitoring the situation of Fulham attacker Harry Wilson ahead of the winter transfer window deadline, according to the BBC. Aston Villa manager Unai Emery wants to bolster his options in the final third at the Villa Park club and would love to sign the Wales international. Wilson is out of contract at the end of the season, and Fulham are desperate to get the 28-year-old to extend his deal. However, the Villans target prefers to get clarity on the future of Fulham head coach Marco Silva, who is also out of contract in the summer, before deciding over any new deal.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Craven Cottage club will be open to selling Wilson this window, but he could be available for a decent fee if they do. He will be a free agent at the end of the season if he does not extend his deal and more clubs will join the Villans if he becomes available by then. The former Liverpool star has been involved in 13 goals so far this term, with eight goals and five assists to his name in 25 games. Wilson ended last term with six goals and two assists in 25 league games and Villa could do with his quality and experience as they target a top-four finish this season.\n\nGetting him this window could prove tricky for the Midlands club as Fulham are unlikely to be open to losing such a player midway through the season. Villa will also be facing competition from the likes of Brentford, Everton and Crystal Palace for Wilson if he becomes available by any chance this month.\n\nThey have signed Brazilian forward Alysson from Gremio in a £10 million deal, while Leon Bailey has been recalled from his loan at AS Roma, with Donyell Malen joining the Serie A club.",

Maple syrup. Lovely. First of all, I always have, for example, pancakes before a match. I just like pancakes and I always need to have maple syrup. Honestly, I eat this with everything.\n\nAlex: When was the last time you were actually at home in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Oh - probably in the summer, as I spent my Christmas here.\n\nAlex: What do you think of home? Can you build a picture for me of what life was like for you growing up back home?\n\nOlivia: I have a younger sister, so we grew up together. My family were all kind of goofballs I would say. So just playing games a lot, we're always outside, we have dogs as well. So I've grown up with dogs and just go to the park, play football, play with the dogs. That's kind of like what a typical day would look like.\n\nAlex: So your sister plays football?\n\nAlex: What position does she play?\n\nOlivia: Midfielder, winger, striker.\n\nAlex: So does she look up to you and want to follow in your footsteps?\n\nOlivia: I hope so, but she claims she's better than me!\n\nAlex: Does she literally watch your games and say \"You should have been doing this\" or \"You should have scored that goal\"?\n\nOlivia: Yes - she sends me snapchats of my game and says \"Why did you do that?\" I'm like, well, \"What would you have done?\"\n\nAlex: What did she think when you made your move to Arsenal?\n\nOlivia: She was so excited. I mean she also looks up to a team like Arsenal, she loves watching me play so then for me to get the opportunity and really be a role model for her playing with girls like Alessia [Russo] and Leah [Williamson], it's amazing. She's really excited for me.\n\nAlex: Who do you look up to back in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Christine Sinclair. She's a huge legend in the game of course, and also Marta. Then I love watching the men's game as well, so I was always looking up to Neymar, Ronaldinho, Messi, players like that.\n\nAlex: What did your family make of you playing football?\n\nOlivia: I think my dad really grew me into football and he kind of paved the way for me. He made so many sacrifices for me to be where I am today. I also wanted it and he could see that.\n\nAlex: How would your family and friends describe you?\n\nOlivia: Oh, ambitious, crazy... just attacking-minded. My dad always described me whenever I'd play as I'd just take the ball off my own team-mates to go score a goal!\n\nAlex: What was it like for you to make that transition when you finally moved away from Canada playing football?\n\nOlivia: It was quite tough, although I had been away from home for a bit before that. But going to Portugal, for example, it's a whole new world. Different language, different style of football. So having to learn that really on my own was quite tough. But the support system that I had around me was great, so I was able to adapt, I'd say, quite quickly, which is nice.\n\nAnd then, obviously, coming over to England, then that's a whole other environment, style of play, different kinds of people. And obviously it just takes a little bit [of time] to get comfortable. Once you make friends and you're happy, it makes a world of difference on the pitch and off the pitch.\n\nAlex: What would you say is the biggest thing you've learned about yourself?\n\nOlivia: I would say I always thought I was quite independent, but coming here and my ability to make relationships with people on my team and outside of football as well, it has really helped me to acclimatise to what life is like here.\n\nAlex: So we need to explain your background. The Jamaican food - your dad - Jamaican roots, right? And I learned your mum has Chilean and Peruvian roots. What was dinner like at home?\n\nOlivia: Dinner looks different pretty much every day and especially when my grandparents would come by to cook. That's when you know it's on top. So we'd have jerk chicken and my grandpa would make oxtail and my grandmother would make something called seco.\n\nOlivia: It's like a [Peruvian] meat stew and rice, and it's in a green sauce - it's really nice.\n\nAlex: And your grandads played football?\n\nAlex: So when they come round, were there football matches? Were you watching them?\n\nOlivia: I was always playing with them when we went on vacation to the Dominican - we always found a pitch and then we would play pick-up games with random people. My grandparents would join, I would join, my dad and my sister - it was always fun.\n\nAlex: What's your typical day off looking like?\n\nOlivia: It depends on the day and how I feel, but I do pretty much like to stay at home. I like to watch movies, binge watch, I also play video games as well. So, yeah, games, probably a little bit of shopping because I love to shop.\n\nAlex: Right. So if you're not playing football, you are..?\n\nAlex: If one song could be playing when you score a goal, what would it be?\n\nOlivia: I'm going to go with A Milli [by Lil Wayne] because I have that on my pre-match playlists. I think every game.\n\nAlex: The last thing you wrote in your phone notes was?\n\nOlivia: Oh. A bunch of numbers. I was playing an escape room game, so I needed to write down all these numbers so I could put it into a code.\n\nAlex: Since moving to England, what's one thing that you're just like \"I absolutely love this\"?\n\nOlivia: I fell in love with Yorkshire puddings and a Sunday dinner. It's my favourite thing - I absolutely love them now.\n\nAlex: Not many people love Yorkshire puddings.\n\nOlivia: Well, initially I wasn't sure. I was very hesitant because I had in my mind, like gravy on bread. And when I tried it for the first time I thought - how do you even describe Yorkshire puddings?\n\nAlex: Let's think about when we're looking ahead to the season, what are your goals and ambitions?\n\nOlivia: Ultimately, I want to become a better version of myself as a player. I know there's a lot of things I need to develop on, and being at Arsenal that will definitely help me. And ultimately I want to win things.\n\nAlex: Do you feel that you've settled in and the reasons that made you want to come to the club are starting to open up to you?\n\nOlivia: Yeah, 100%. I think the first couple of months it was a lot to really take in, but the girls have been amazing making me feel comfortable.\n\nAlex: Talk me through that first day when you arrived at Arsenal.\n\nOlivia: I was absolutely terrified, yeah, because every time we played Arsenal it was just a massive game. Obviously you never know what the environment is like from the outside, and I didn't know what to expect. And walking in, it was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be - everyone was just so welcoming.\n\nAlex: Who's the MVP, the person that if they weren't there tomorrow you'd be thinking \"this feels strange\"?\n\nOlivia: Less [Russo] really. She just has that personality and that vibe that you can feel at the training ground. It's just very comfortable and you can speak to her about anything. She's just very sweet.\n\nAlex: Renee [Slegers] has just signed a new three-year contract. In terms of the other managers that you've played for, how is she different?\n\nOlivia: She's just very ambitious and I feel like that goes for all around the club. Her values match [the club] and match the players as well, so I think that's just a really great thing to have, and also stability - knowing that she's going to be here for the next three years. To have a female empower us - I think that's her big thing as well, that she wants the players to feel empowered and use our voices - which every time that I've spoken to her I'm like, yeah, that's impressive.\n\nAlex: Do you know about my history with Renee? I used to be her teacher when she first came over. I was a teacher at the Arsenal Academy at the time so it's kind of full circle to see her go on to manage the team. She knows what being at the club means for everyone.\n\nAlex: Talking of the next thing, when you're looking at you and your career, what is it that you want to tick off? What do you want to achieve?\n\nOlivia: Oh, there's plenty of things I want to achieve. I want to win everything, ultimately. And again, the biggest thing is I just want to keep developing and growing as a person and a player. I think that's really important to me, just continue to develop my character, meeting more people and just learning.\n\nAlex: You said meeting more people. How have the Arsenal fans embraced you?\n\nOlivia: They've been amazing. I attended the [Arsenal Women fan engagement project] Block by Block, external consultation a couple of weeks ago where we discussed how we can make matchdays better.\n\nIt was really fun because I got to interact with the fans more on a personal level rather than them being up in the stands and just clapping - actually having a conversation and seeing what we can do to make the experience better for them, but also for us as players. Whether that's music, fireworks, just making it more fun.\n\nAlex: I bet the fans must have been buzzing. Did they know that you were turning up?\n\nOlivia: I'm actually not sure, but they seemed quite shocked when I pulled up!\n\nWatch: Arsenal v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Saturday, 24 June (12:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

There are also bonus points on offer for every round reached across the three competitions, although more points are given to teams competing in the Champions League than in the other competitions.\n\nIn the qualification rounds, these points are halved.\n\nPoints earned are then divided by how many teams from that country entered European competitions at the start of the season.\n\nIn the 2025-26 season, England have nine teams competing in Europe. That means all points are divided by nine.\n\nScotland started the season with five teams competing in Europe. Although Hibernian and Dundee United failed to progress out of the qualifying rounds, three teams remain - but Scotland's points are still divided by five.\n\nFor this season, England and Spain were given one extra spot each as they were the two best-performing nations across the 2024-25 campaign. That meant entry to the Champions League was given to Newcastle and Athletic Club.\n\nFor the 2024-25 season, Italy and Germany were given the two places, known as European Performances Spots (EPS).

    "fullText": "LeBron James missed out on selection as an NBA All-Star starter for first time in 22 years, but the Los Angeles Lakers star could still feature in February's event.\n\nOn Monday, the NBA announced the 10 players voted as starters, including Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo, Denver Nuggets' Nikola Jokic, the Lakers' Luka Doncic and San Antonio Spurs' Victor Wembanyama.\n\nFans accounted for 50% of the vote to determine the 2026 starters, while current NBA players and a media panel each accounted for 25%.\n\nThe five players with the best score in each conference were named as starters across the three teams, with international players playing for the world team.\n\nJames, 41, was ranked ninth overall in the Western Conference by voters.\n\nThe NBA's all-time leading scorer can still earn selection as a reserve for the game held in Los Angeles on 15 February, but he will have to rely on a panel of NBA coaches to play as one of the 14 reserves.\n\nJames was selected in 2025 but did not play in the event after picking up an injury.\n\nThe All-Star game has been revamped this season and will feature two teams of players from the United States and one team of international players.\n\nThey will compete in a round-robin tournament comprising of four 12-minute games. The top two teams will then face each other in a championship game.\n\nPlayers selected from Eastern Conference:\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo - Milwaukee Bucks\n\nJalen Brunson - New York Knicks\n\nCade Cunningham - Detroit Pistons\n\nTyrese Maxey - Philadelphia 76ers\n\nPlayers selected from Western Conference:\n\nStephen Curry - Golden State Warriors\n\nLuka Doncic - Los Angeles Lakers\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander - Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nVictor Wembanyama - San Antonio Spurs\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhat changes are being made to 2026 NBA All-Star game?\n\nWhat is the NBA's controversial '65-game rule' and how is it impacting players?\n\nWhat is an ACL injury and why is it so serious?",

I think I wanted cats here in England because I couldn't have a lion or a tiger.\n\n\"I love animals. I will always be more comfortable in the jungle, the forest or the wild than in a place like Las Vegas with all the lights. This life is not for me.\n\n\"For me, the beauty is not where there are lights, cameras and parties. That is a way to spend money and get into trouble.\n\n\"You'll usually find bad things in those places. But in the wild I feel at peace.\"",
