    "fullText": "Trevoh Chalobah has a big Match of the Day interview coming up this weekend, and the BBC have been teasing little bits of it in advance.\n\nThey asked Trevoh to name his top 3 centre backs and why he liked them so much. His answers tell you a lot about the kind of players he wants to be.\n\n“Number three, Thiago Silva. I used to watch him back in school on Youtube and get in trouble. For me he just has everything. He can head, he can play, when he was in his prime he was quick, he was strong, a leader. I’ve always loved Thiago.”\n\n“Number two I’d go for Sergio Ramos, just a winner. A leader. Always wants to put his body on the line. I used to watch a lot of El Clasico and he would stand out,” the defender continued.\n\n“Number one? John Terry, legend of the club. What he did in the Premier League, what he did for the club. He helped me out a lot when I was younger and I would train with the first team. He would be the one to put his arm around the young players, to help them gain a bit of confidence, you know.”\n\nA very good set of answers there. It never ceases to amaze us how many nice things you’ll find everyone saying about JT who has worked at Chelsea.\n\nYou can see Chalobah speaking in the clip embedded here:\n\nWhile Chelsea delay, their sister club is getting into gear. Strasbourg have already agreed a €7m deal for a talented attacking midfielder who will apparently take his medical today.\n\nChelsea are suddenly seemingly interested in January transfer moves, and Matt Law of the Daily Telegraph has a big update on a potential sale the Blues could made.",

Everyone will know me one day.\"\n\nHis mother may have thought he did not really know what he was talking about. But he knew.\n\nHowever, his path to success has not been straightforward.\n\nHe had to wait until he was 17 to sign for a club, having faced several rejections at trials around Brazil.\n\n\"Thiago would call me late at night in tears to say that football wasn't for him,\" Sergio Goncalves, his mentor from his early years at Gremio Ocidental, a local community football initiative, tells BBC Sport. \"But he was born to score goals.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old has found the back of the net 16 times in the Premier League this season.\n\nHe is on target to reach the 20-goal mark once again in his career - having done so in three of his four seasons in Europe, the only exception being his debut campaign with Brentford, which was disrupted by a serious injury.\n\nThiago's next stop is Saturday's west London derby against Chelsea.",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick has been tasked with saving Manchester United's Premier League season after being named as caretaker manager for the rest of the campaign.\n\nIt is not uncharted territory for United or Carrick, with the former England midfielder having taken charge of three United games following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021.\n\nUnited have considerable experience of operating with an interim head coach. They turned to Solskjaer after sacking Jose Mourinho in December 2018, later offering the Norwegian the full-time position after he lost only once in 13 league games in charge.\n\nThe club also hired Ralf Rangnick to lead the team for six months after Solskjaer's dismissal and Carrick's brief stint, but the Austrian struggled to implement his gameplan and battled with the hierarchy over recruitment - winning 11 games, drawing 10 and losing eight as the Red Devils finished sixth in the Premier League and without a trophy.\n\nUnited will be hoping Carrick can succeed in the same manner as Guus Hiddink, who delivered the FA Cup at Chelsea in 2009 as an interim, and Roberto di Matteo, who led the Blues to FA Cup and Champions League glory in 2012.\n\nBut what does an interim coach do? How is the job different to a full-time position? And is hiring an interim manager a good idea?",

Nobody who has ever met a teenager, or read the news, will be completely at ease with the role of social media in young lives. There are horrific effects, which have been well documented and inadequately addressed ever since the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing suicide and self-harm content online.\n\nMany platforms, even those that seem anodyne, are purpose-built to spur anxiety, self-doubt, self-harm, anything that delivers attention. We have this completely contradictory environment in which a nine-year-old can’t walk to school alone without turning into grist for a radio phone-in about parental neglect, and yet tech companies with a record of generating emotional distress for profit are allowed access to children’s bedrooms. Grok can generate sexualised images of children on demand, and the UK government calls it a matter for Ofcom.\n\nThe asymmetry of acceptable risk between the real world and the virtual, even while we can see that online harms show up soon enough in lived experience, is inexplicable. It must be more baffling still if you happen to be under 16, working on the assumption that the adults telling you what to do must know what they’re talking about.\n\nEven at the milder end, a lot of social media apps seem designed to mess with a young mind. Take the problems created by location services, whereby kids are able to see one another’s whereabouts 24/7, so discovering in real time what they haven’t been invited to and what their ex-best friend is up to; or the intolerable body-image pressure of a life lived in selfies; or the stress of the streak (a chain of back-and-forth messages or pictures), friendships torched by a slow reply.\n\nIn short, not everything is wrong with Badenoch’s idea; only two things. First, if there’s one thing more ridiculous than taking a corporate failure and throwing it to the individual to solve, by self-discipline reinforced by legislation, it is doing so to under-16s. If a corporation is selling radical misogyny and methods for self-harm – because what else are they going to do, disappoint shareholders? – that is not for a 12-year-old to fix by turning off their phone and taking up crochet. It’s not for a parent to fix, either, by instituting a load of screen limits and parental blocks; even if you enjoy that side of things, it shouldn’t be up to you to fill late-capitalism’s moral void. You could make the case for government intervention, but only if it had time on its hands after tackling the problem at source.\n\nSecond, while young people are unarguably the target of so much manipulative content, to discuss online risks without mentioning older people is frankly perverse. An X user recently asked Grok to identify misinformation super-spreaders on the site from the UK, and probably the youngest among them were Tommy Robinson, 43, and Darren Grimes, 32.. This was data crunched from Amnesty, Global Witness and the BBC, among others, and helpfully built a list of accounts most likely to promulgate untruth or conspiracy, with the caveat it was “subjective and depends on sources”: Nigel Farage, Laurence Fox, Julia Hartley-Brewer, George Galloway, Katie Hopkins, David Icke. None are of a tender age. Between Gen X miscreants and hyper-credulous boomers, there are generations that pose a greater risk to, and are themselves at risk from, the informational ecosystem. Any thinking politician needs to work out how to deal with them.",

As a manager, I understood why - even though I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when it was considered very special by everyone - and this year will be no different.\n\nAfter a busy festive period and another round of games in midweek this week, the games this weekend will be looked on by the Premier League teams as a chance to rest some of their players, and in some cases all of them!\n\nIt's sad to see, even if it could lead to opportunities for smaller clubs to join the band of giantkillers which the competition has become famous for down the years.\n\nI have experienced both sides of the coin. When we were promoted to the Premier League in 2008, Stoke initially struggled and at the turn of the year, when we came to a third-round tie at League One side Hartlepool, I changed practically the whole team.",

'The Woman Engineer.'\n\nCaroline was born in 1895. Her father was an engineer on the railway and he taught her about machines and tools.\n\nShe was usually happier playing with nuts and bolts than making doll's clothes.\n\nIn 1914 Caroline started work at the Cochran Company, an engineering firm that made boilers, where she was kept busy with orders from the war office.\n\nIn 1918 the Cochran Company sent Caroline to Scotland. The men there thought it was unusual for a woman to be so interested in engineering.\n\nAfter the war, she asked women which electrical appliances they would like in their homes.\n\nIn 1924 Caroline was in charge of an association that taught women about electricity.\n\nShe later helped the government improve science education for girls.\n\nDuring World War Two Caroline went on important missions for the British government.\n\nCaroline became a Dame in 1947.

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on DJ and producer Shadow Child - and AI - with his predictions for all 32 FA Cup third-round ties.",
    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has made his predictions for all 32 FA Cup third-round ties.\n\nHe is up against DJ and producer Shadow Child, aka Simon Neale, and AI.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\n\nShadow Child is a Portsmouth fan who has fond memories of the FA Cup that go back much further than when Pompey won it in 2008.\n\n\"That was huge, and so was when we lost narrowly in the final two years later,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But my favourite FA Cup memory was actually 1992, when we had a run to the semi-finals and lost to eventual winners Liverpool in a replay.\n\n\"I was 15, stood on the Clock End at Highbury for the first of those games, and that is when I fully understood the emotion that goes with football.\n\n\"I'd been going to Fratton Park since I was five, but that was the moment for me. That's the power of the FA Cup, and a run like that can resonate with you for your whole life.\n\n\"The year we won it, all five games from round three to the final were 1-0 wins. You take them all, obviously, but most of those ties were not that glamorous.\n\n\"The really memorable game that year was our 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Rio Ferdinand ended up in goal when we scored our winner from the penalty spot, which sounds crazy talking about it now. Again, I will never forget it.\"\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\n5th in League Two v 23rd in Championship\n\nOxford must be short of confidence going into this one. They are in a relegation battle, have lost four of their past five games and are still without a manager after sacking Gary Rowett before Christmas.\n\nCraig Short is in interim charge and, like all teams fighting the drop, I'm sure Championship survival is his priority over the FA Cup.\n\nMK Dons boss Paul Warne is an old team-mate of mine from my village team, Horsford Under-12s, and he learnt a lot from playing alongside me.\n\nThey are going well under him in the league and I have got faith in Paul to deliver an FA Cup shock.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, MK Dons to win on penalties\n\nSimon's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n24th in League One v 13th in League Two\n\nPort Vale are struggling and they are another team who have just changed their manager. This will be Jon Brady's first game in charge, after they sacked Darren Moore at the end of December.\n\nVale got a big win over Blackpool on New Year's Day but they have still got the worst home record in League One, with only two wins there all season.\n\nFleetwood knocked out another League One side, Luton, on penalties in round two which was a great result - so the Cod Army won't be afraid of Vale, either.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Port Vale win on penalties\n\n4th in Championship v 15th in League One\n\nPaul Heckingbottom is doing a fine job at Preston but, with them chasing promotion, he is probably weighing up whether he wants another FA Cup run after his side reached the quarter-finals last year.\n\nWigan have come through two penalty shootouts to reach round three. Their boss Ryan Lowe will be desperate to get one over his former club but, even if Preston make changes, I still think they will edge this.\n\n9th in Championship v 17th in Premier League\n\nMoney-bags Wrexham have picked up a bit of form in the Championship, with one of my colleagues from the Monday Night Club, Conor Coady, their rock at the back.\n\nNottingham Forest got a huge win at West Ham on Tuesday and Sean Dyche will want to carry that momentum on here.\n\nI suspect this will be tight, because Wrexham are unbeaten in 10 games at home, but Forest should have a little bit too much quality.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\n\nEV Charger Points Stadium, 12:15 GMT\n\n18th in League Two v 12th in Championship\n\nI know Cheltenham aren't having a great time of it because one of their fans is a regular caller on 606.\n\nLeicester are having a poor season too, though, and their supporters were expecting a lot more from them following their relegation from the Premier League.\n\nThis is a must-win game for Foxes boss Marti Cifuentes, who is coming under a bit of pressure because his side are toiling in mid-table.\n\nCheltenham will be really up for this, but I think Cifuentes will get the result he needs.\n\n12th in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI'd like to think these teams will have a real go at the FA Cup this season, because neither of them have got relegation to worry about, but they both come into this tie off the back of poor results.\n\nThe Black Cats' defeat at Brentford was a very un-Sunderland like performance compared to what we've seen from them this season, while Everton will be very disappointed to have only drawn at home to Wolves.\n\nThe last time Sunderland reached the final, when they lost to Liverpool in 1992, they broke my heart on the way when they beat my Norwich side in the semi-final. I missed a great chance in that game too, when I ballooned a shot over the bar.\n\nIt still haunts me how we didn't make it to Wembley that year - we deserved to. Sunderland are due another FA Cup run because they have only made it to round four once in the past 10 years, but I don't think this is their year either.\n\nI can see this going to penalties, and Jordan Pickford will win it for the Toffees.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Everton win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I don't see this being a great game, more a battle of attrition. 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n14th in National League North v 13th in Premier League\n\nWhat a tie this is. My 606 co-host Robbie Savage built the foundations for this Macclesfield side and they have gone on an amazing run under John Rooney to get this far.\n\nIt started with a win over Atherton Laburnum Rovers in the second qualifying round in September.\n\nOne of their scorers that day was Ethan McLeod, who died in a car accident before Christmas on his way back from a game, which puts everything in perspective.\n\nThis would be the biggest shock in FA Cup history if Macclesfield won, because no sixth-tier side has ever beaten one from the top flight since the FA Cup started in 1871, but I don't think that will happen.\n\nPalace have not been in good form recently but they played well in their draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday when they defended strongly.\n\nThe holders are solid even when they don't fire up front, and they should win this pretty comfortably.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I'd love this to be different because we all love a giant-killing, but I can't see it. 0-4\n\n20th in Premier League v 22nd in League Two\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards is starting to get a tune out of his players and Mateus Mane is really shining for them.\n\nDoes Edwards change things up here, or does he look to build more momentum?\n\nThis is a local derby but he has played for both clubs so he will get what the tie is all about, and Shrewsbury don't really look like they are in the kind of shape to spring a surprise at Molineux, either.\n\nThey have not won any of their past eight league games and staying in the Football League will be the main thing on their manager Michael Appleton's mind.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n2nd in National League v 21st in League One\n\nBoreham Wood are flying and Robbie Savage always tells me how strong they are - he really rates them.\n\nThey reached the fifth round in 2022 under Luke Garrard, when they lost at Everton, and I think their run will continue this year too.\n\nI know Garrard's focus might be on promotion to the Football League, because getting out of the National League is brutal, but his side are up against a Burton team who are bang out of form at the bottom of League One.\n\nWood will have to stop the top scorer in the FA Cup this season, Tyrese Shade, who has scored five goals in two games for Burton so far - but I am backing them to put Shade in the shade.\n\n19th in Premier League v 5th in Championship\n\nI have a feeling this will be quite close. Millwall are really well organised under Alex Neil and I am not surprised they are doing well this season.\n\nBurnley have started picking up a few draws, but they still haven't won since the end of October.\n\nThis could be the day that changes, although Scott Parker's side will have to work hard to finish Millwall off.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Burnley win on penalties\n\n23rd in League One v 15th in Championship\n\nSouthampton have dropped off after making a good start under Tonda Eckert. He won his first four games after replacing Will Still at the start of November, but has not won any of his past six matches.\n\nDoncaster are on a similar run in League One, taking one point from a possible 18, and with both teams in such poor form, it might take penalties to separate them.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Southampton to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: Putting our south-coast differences aside, Southampton will probably win... but come on Doncaster! 2-0\n\n9th in Premier League v 2nd in Championship\n\nIt will be interesting to see what Fulham boss Marco Silva does here, with his team on such a good run of Premier League results. I hope he goes strong, to try to keep their momentum going.\n\nSilva has good record in the FA Cup anyhow, reaching the quarter-final twice in the past three years. He has also never lost a third-round tie with any of the four English clubs he has managed, and I don't see that changing this weekend.\n\nMiddlesbrough got back on track with a big win over Southampton on Sunday but they hit a sticky patch over Christmas when their goals dried up and it is pretty obvious that their promotion bid will be the priority for their manager Kim Hellberg.\n\n3rd in Championship v 18th in League One\n\nIpswich have started to hit their stride in the Championship and have only lost one of their past eight games.\n\nLike Hellberg at Boro, I suspect Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna will make full use of his squad here but they should still have too much for a Blackpool side who are struggling in League One.\n\nIt is nice to be able to predict an Ipswich result again, and it would be good if their fans had something to cheer about after they had such a miserable time in the Premier League last season.\n\nMcKenna is such a good manager, I think they will get one of the automatic promotion spots, sadly. They won't win the FA Cup though!\n\n2nd in Premier League v 14th in League One\n\nManchester City have reached the final in the past two seasons and they are my pick to win the FA Cup this year. Pep Guardiola always takes the competition seriously and that won't change whatever happens in the title race.\n\nGuardiola's side have paid the price for not putting games to bed in the past few days and those dropped points are making things easier for Arsenal at the top of the table.\n\nI don't see Manchester City having any problems here, though, even if they field a second-string side.\n\nExeter City boss Gary Caldwell lifted the FA Cup in 2013 when he was part of the Wigan team that upset Manchester City in the final. What a great memory that must be for him, but his side are going out on Saturday.\n\n6th in Premier League v 15th in Premier League\n\nI just wonder how much Wednesday night's epic game against Leeds will have taken out of Newcastle, who have got the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final with Manchester City coming up next week too.\n\nThere was also plenty of late drama in Bournemouth's win over Tottenham, but my concern with the Cherries is more about the effect of Antoine Semenyo's departure, because it appears he has played his last game for them.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe does not have a great record against his old club in the Premier League, where he has not got the better of them in seven attempts, but he did beat them in the Carabao Cup in 2022.\n\nI was tempted to go for a Bournemouth win here, but I am not sure how many changes Andoni Iraola will make either.\n\nThe one thing I am sure of is that there will be a few goals flying in, because of the way both teams play. Let's go for another thriller, with a shootout to settle it.\n\nSutton's prediction: 3-3 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\n4th in League Two v 2nd in League Two\n\nThese teams meet each other again in the league next week, and I suspect the points will matter more to Swindon boss Ian Holloway and Salford manager Karl Robinson than this tie.\n\nSalford beat Swindon 3-2 here in September but Holloway's side have the best away record in the division and I'm going with them to nick it in extra time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Salford win on penalties\n\n24th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nIt is really sad to see what has happened at Sheffield Wednesday and there is no way for them to salvage their season now.\n\nBrentford are flying at the moment under Keith Andrews and they are another club who I'd love to see have a real go at the FA Cup this season.\n\nThe Bees have never got past the quarter-finals in their history, and have not even got that far since 1989. You only have to look at Palace last year to find a team winning it for the first time so it is definitely doable for them too.\n\n8th in Championship v 1st in Championship\n\nCoventry are having a little wobble. They are still top of the Championship, but Sunday's defeat at Birmingham means they have only one win in their past five matches.\n\nThat just makes me think Sky Blues boss Frank Lampard will rest players here, and it is a real opportunity for my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins against his former club.\n\nRobins had that great run to the semi-finals with Coventry a couple of years back, and you can imagine he will be absolutely determined that Stoke get through this tie.\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Stoke win on penalties\n\n10th in Championship v 6th in Championship\n\nWatford have really hit form and come into this on the back of four wins in a row.\n\nBristol City, in contrast, have been patchy but again I think both sides will make changes.\n\nIt finished 1-1 at Ashton Gate in November, and I'm going for the same scoreline again, with City winning on penalties.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Bristol City to win on penalties\n\n6th in League Two v 14th in Championship\n\nCambridge are on a heck of a run, and have gone 14 games unbeaten in all competitions since the end of October.\n\nBirmingham, meanwhile, have been a bit flaky. Blues boss Chris Davies needed Sunday's win over Coventry because his side have not really got going this season.\n\nOn paper, this has the makings of a shock because Birmingham have not won many on the road, but I actually fancy my old club to go on a bit of a cup run this year, and they will start by giving Cambridge an education.\n\n12th in League Two v 2nd in National League South\n\nI was at Blundell Park when Grimsby knocked Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup in August, and what a night that was.\n\nNow the Mariners are trying to avoid being on the wrong end of a huge upset themselves but, again, home advantage will help.\n\nWeston-super-Mare are in the third round for the first time in their 138-year history, which is an amazing achievement, but their cup run ends here.\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 17:45\n\n14th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\n\nPoor old Thomas Frank. He looked so happy at Brentford but Spurs have a habit of turning happy managers into total miseries.\n\nHe really needs a win here, and a good run in the cup too, but when you compare the two teams, and the way they are playing, then there's only one winner here - and that's Villa.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: This is the kind of game Tottenham need, because there is less pressure on them. Villa are going more for the top four and Spurs could take this. 3-2\n\n19th in Championship v 8th in Premier League\n\nIt doesn't feel as if Liam Rosenior's appointment has been particularly welcomed by some Chelsea fans.\n\nThis is his first game in charge and he could really do with making a fast start to help win some of the doubters over.\n\nThere are tougher tests to come - like Arsenal in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final next week - but I think he will get the result he wants here.\n\nThere will be a packed house at The Valley, with Charlton's biggest crowd for an FA Cup tie in 50 years, but the Addicks are not in great form and Chelsea's quality should see them through.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: It's been a turbulent week for Chelsea too, and again we will see a response. I always try to visualise things when I think about them, and when I pictured The Valley, I just saw Chelsea scoring! 1-3\n\n13th in Championship v 16th in Premier League\n\nLeeds have been terrific recently and, as regular readers will know, I am really pleased for their manager Daniel Farke and how he has changed the narrative about his future.\n\nI can see Farke making plenty of changes here because, while he would love a cup run, he knows there is still work to do to keep his side in the Premier League.\n\nThat's why I am going for Derby to cause an upset. They are improving all the time under John Eustace and while Leeds will be full of confidence off the back of the past few weeks, I am not sure they will maintain their intensity with a second-string side.\n\n21st in Championship v 1st in Premier League\n\nArsenal will definitely make changes here, but it won't make any difference.\n\nPortsmouth are in trouble at the bottom of the Championship and they look short of what is required there, let alone against the Premier League leaders - or even their reserves.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I very reluctantly have to be realistic here - I hate to say it, but I would be really shocked if Arsenal didn't win. If we took them to penalties that would be incredible, but I don't think we will. It depends what team they put out, but whoever plays, it is going to be difficult for us.\n\nI can't make it to the game but I will be glued to the TV, and my dad will be there - he has been a season ticket holder at Fratton Park since 1967. 0-1\n\n7th in Championship v 20th in Championship\n\nHull are having a great season, while Blackburn are in serious danger of being relegated.\n\nIt is no surprise that Rovers are struggling because they just don't have the quality in their side.\n\nIt turns my stomach to see the state of my old club now compared to the way it was when I was there in the 1990s, because it is a shadow of its former self.\n\nSurvival is all Blackburn fans can hope for, while Hull supporters must be dreaming of a return to the Premier League. They are going to win this tie, too.\n\n22nd in Championship v 3rd in League Two\n\nNorwich are another of my old clubs who are fighting relegation, although at least Philippe Clement has picked up a few wins since he took charge in November.\n\nThe Canaries have lost their past couple of home games, to Watford and Stoke, but Clement has done really well to give them a chance of staying up. Now they need to spend in January, because he needs a bit of help.\n\nI am not sure Clement wants or needs an FA Cup run now but Norwich fans could do with a bit of cheer at Carrow Road.\n\nI am backing Norwich to win but I need to apologise to Walsall boss Mat Sadler anyhow. They were flying last season, but then he came on the Monday Night Club in January and he was one of the managers we cursed.\n\nWhoever came on, their results fell through the floor afterwards, so we were to blame for Walsall's slide down the table.\n\n16th in Championship v 11th in League One\n\nTwo wily old managers go head to head here.\n\nBetween them, Sheffield United's Chris Wilder and Mansfield's Nigel Clough have spent more than 50 years in the dug-out, and I have got a lot of respect for both of them.\n\nWilder has turned things around for the Blades after their dreadful start to the campaign and, while Clough has won his last three games with the Stags, I am going for Sheffield United to continue their improvement.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n17th in Championship v 18th in Championship\n\nWest Brom have just sacked their manager Ryan Mason, so James Morrison is in charge for this one.\n\nThe Baggies could really do with a win but their form on the road is awful - they have lost 10 away games in a row.\n\nSwansea changed their manager recently too, with Vitor Matos replacing Alan Sheehan in November, and their season has been just as disappointing.\n\nWhile West Brom won 3-2 when these teams met at The Hawthorns in November, Swansea pinched a 1-0 win at Liberty Stadium on New Year's Day.\n\nI'm going for another close game this time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Swansea to win on penalties\n\n18th in Premier League v 11th in Championship\n\nThis is a must-win for West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo and, let's face it, they might sack him anyway even if he gets past QPR.\n\nI don't think home advantage helps the Hammers, who suffered a catastrophic defeat against Forest at the London Stadium on Tuesday. I'm not sure how many of their fans will turn up for this game, and the ones who do are not going to be in a good mood either.\n\nBut while West Ham have been very poor recently, they still have some good players and they should surely still see off a mid-table Championship team on their own patch.\n\nQPR have been knocked out in the third round of the FA Cup more times - 52 - than any other side since the current format of the competition started 100 years ago.\n\nI am going for them to suffer defeat number 53, and for Nuno to survive a little bit longer.\n\n7th in Premier League v 11th in Premier League\n\nBrighton have been quite erratic this season, and I have done really badly at predicting their results, but they have proved time and time again how dangerous they are.\n\nIt's a boost for United that Bruno Fernandes is fit again, but their draw with Burnley on Thursday was still a poor result.\n\nI know United fans love it when their side proves me wrong after I predict they will lose, but I can't see them doing that on Sunday.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: United have had an interesting week. I've gone for them to win because I am expecting a huge reaction from them and their fans at Old Trafford, but Danny Welbeck will nick one for Brighton. 3-1\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, United win on penalties\n\n4th in Premier League v 17th in League One\n\nBristol City fans will come to Anfield hoping for a repeat of their famous win here in the FA Cup in 2008, but I don't see another shock on the cards.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot will have learnt his lesson about the cup after last season, when his side crashed out to Plymouth after he made 10 changes.\n\nSlot needs an FA Cup run this season, so I am sure he will not risk another upset here. If Liverpool were to lose this, he would be under serious pressure.\n\nI am just not convinced by the way his side are playing at the moment, and I don't think many Liverpool fans are either.\n\nEven so, they are at home to a League One side, and this should be a pretty routine victory.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The BBC have detailed how it’s a gloomy task for new Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior to reach the minimum aim this season.\n\nThe Blues slipped to 8th in the Premier League table last night after losing 2-1 away from home against Fulham.\n\nMarc Cucurella got himself sent off early in the game with what was a stupid moment from the full back in a moment of madness.\n\nChelsea players then lost their heads in the aftermath complaining about a decision that was a stone wall one in my opinion, with three of their players getting booked for dissent right after.\n\nStriker Liam Delap did manage to get a goal back for Chelsea and everyone started believing that their ten men might actually get something out of the game.\n\nBut any hope was soon crushed there when Fulham pressed on again and found that all important second and winning goal. Chelsea down to 8th in the league.\n\nBehdad Eghbali in the stands at Fulham.\n\nNizaar Kinsella of The BBC writes:\n\n“Chelsea have won just one of their past nine league games and two of 11 in all competitions, falling from potential title contenders in November to a side now lagging far behind.\n\n“They have ground to make up to achieve their minimum aim this season – qualifying for the Champions League, which should be achievable with a top-five finish.”\n\nI think if anything, this is playing it all down a bit. That is a very gloomy looking task for Rosenior, and he only has half a season to do it. Yikes.\n\nChelsea are only five points ahead of 15th place in the Premier League table right now and 17 points off first placed Arsenal.",

    "description": "Find out which players made the cut into the BBC Sport team of the series for the Ashes.",
    "fullText": "BBC Sport readers have picked their team of the series for the Ashes.\n\nWe asked you to pick an 11 that included two openers, four middle-order batters or all-rounders, a wicketkeeper and four bowlers.\n\nHere's who made the cut and their series stats.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 629, average: 62.90, centuries: three\n\nNo doubts about this man's selection. Travis Head stepped up to open in the first Test and has dominated from the top of the order. He blazed 123 in Perth, sealed the series victory with 170 in Adelaide and then added 163 in Sydney for good measure.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 273, average: 27.30, centuries: none\n\nBar Head, the other openers in the series have enjoyed modest returns. Zak Crawley was dismissed for a pair in Perth, but made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 286, average: 57.20, centuries: one\n\nSo frequently a feature of English nightmares, Steve Smith had a relatively quiet series initially, passing fifty once and missing the Adelaide Test with sickness. However, his 138 in Sydney took the game away from England and saw him become the second-highest Ashes run-scorer behind Don Bradman.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 400, average: 44.44, centuries: two\n\nFeast and famine for England's legendary batter. Joe Root finally got to three figures in Australia, making an unbeaten 138 in Brisbane and 160 in Sydney, but only passed 20 on one other occasion in the series.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 438, average: 39.77, centuries: none\n\nA case of what could have been for Harry Brook. The big-hitting batter passed 40 on five occasions in the series, but his highest score was his 84 in Sydney.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 184, average: 18.40, wickets: 15, average: 25.13\n\nA better series with the ball than with the bat for England's skipper. Ben Stokes was frequently England's most threatening bowler, with his best showing a 5-23 in Perth. He made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide but his next highest score was 19, and he was dismissed for single figures on six occasions.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 323, average: 46.14, dismissals: 28\n\nThe default pick for the wicketkeeper position. Alex Carey prospered both behind the stumps and with the bat. After 63 in Brisbane, he had a dream Test at his home ground of Adelaide, hitting 106 and 72 as Australia clinched the series.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 31, average: 19.93, strike-rate: 29.6; runs: 156\n\nA remarkable series for the left-armer. Mitchell Starc started the series with a bang, taking 10 wickets in Perth as Australia blew England away inside two days. He added 6-75 in the first innings at Brisbane while also contributing crucial half-centuries in both the second and third Tests.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: nine, average: 27.11, strike-rate: 53.33, runs: 102\n\nEngland wanted express pace in Australia and Jofra Archer delivered. While his figures didn't necessarily reflect his contribution in the first two Tests, he took 5-53 in the first innings in Adelaide and added a half-century later in the Test. A side strain saw him withdraw from the series after that match.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 20, average: 24.95, strike-rate: 47.9\n\nScott Boland's nagging accuracy tormented England throughout the series. Thanks to the absence of Josh Hazlewood, the veteran seamer delivered in spades. He even got to open the batting in the quick-paced Test at Melbourne.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: 18, average: 20.11, strike-rate: 32.4\n\nWhat if he'd played earlier? Josh Tongue was introduced in the third Test in Adelaide and set about adding to his already impressive haul of international wickets. He took 4-70 in the second innings in South Australia and picked up 5-45 as England bowled out Australia for 152 on day one in Melbourne.\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - Ashes player ratings",

    "description": "BBC Sport profiles twin brothers Tyler and Jack Fletcher, who will hope to get minutes at Manchester United under interim head coach and father Darren",
    "fullText": "Manchester United interim manager Darren Fletcher's twin sons are both currently midfielders at the club.\n\nThe 19-year-old academy duo featured as part of Ruben Amorim's final few matches in charge of United prior to his dismissal as head coach on Monday.\n\nFormer United midfielder and under-18s head coach Darren was promoted to interim head coach in Amorim's place and will take charge of United's trip to Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Tyler has made the bench in each of United's last three games, Jack was used by Amorim in United's last three matches of 2025 as a substitute.\n\nThe brothers are central midfielders. While both can play more defensively, Jack has also played as a winger on the right side.\n\nThe duo are capped internationally. Although they both started with England's under-16s, Tyler switched nationalities to Scotland - the nation his father represented.\n\nTyler and Jack played against each other in November 2025 during a Under-19s European Championship qualifier between Scotland and England.\n\nIn July 2023, the pair signed for United from direct rivals Manchester City for a reported combined fee of £1.25m.\n\nAlthough there was an element of surprise when Jack Fletcher was named in Ruben Amorim's squad for the trip to Tottenham in November, after Kobbie Mainoo pulled out due to injury, in terms of available midfielders he was next in line.\n\nBoth Jack and Tyler have been central figures in Travis Binnion's Under-21 squad this season. While results against senior teams in both the EFL Trophy and National League Cup have not been exceptional this season, United's Under-21 side go into the second half of the Premier League 2 campaign with an excellent record of seven wins and a single defeat from their eight games. The Fletcher brothers are part of that.\n\nJack is viewed as slightly more progressive in his passing, and tends to play higher up the pitch. He has also featured at full-back at times, which may be an advantage when it comes to making matchday squads at senior level.\n\nBoth were part of Manchester City's academy at one stage, and while Darren Fletcher is evidently a guiding light in their careers, he has been keen to let the pair make their own decisions in terms of their playing journey - including which international team they wanted to represent.\n\nTyler is also good on the ball, but is yet to score this season, which Jack has. However, he is also still to be sent off, which is what happened to Jack in the EFL Trophy at Barnsley, when he objected to a refereeing decision in a manner the referee found unacceptable.\n\nShould either of the Fletcher twins play under father Darren while he is in interim charge of United, they would join an exclusive club of sons to have played under the management of their fathers in the Premier League.\n\nJamie Redknapp played under dad Harry at Southampton, while former United centre-back Steve Bruce managed son Alex at Hull.\n\nAlso at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson handed 18 Premier League appearances to son Darren during the first half of the 1992-93 season.\n\nIn that same season, Nigel Clough played every match under father Brian at Nottingham Forest.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy is the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia?\n\nThe cricketer's son recalled by Guardiola - who is Max Alleyne?\n\nIs the new manager bounce real or a myth?\n\nHow does Amorim's record compare to other Man Utd managers?",

    "fullText": "On days like this, when a manager falls, the immediate reaction is to think about where it all went wrong, the timeline of doom, the moments where the writing started appearing on the wall.\n\nWith Wilfried Nancy, there's no need for any of that because it was never right in the first place. There were no turning points in this saga, no twists in the plot.\n\nNancy's appointment was one of the greatest blunders Celtic have made in their history. A relative rookie on a bad run with Columbus Crew - they finished seventh in Major League Soccer - it was a punt based on little more than the hipster vibes of Paul Tisdale, the now former head of football operations.\n\nTisdale didn't open his mouth to fans or media in his brief time in a powerful position at Celtic Park, but he did a whole lot of damage. If Nancy ranks extremely highly in the club's most calamitous calls then Tisdale is on a par or, perhaps even, slightly ahead of him given that it was the self-styled 'Doctor Football' who championed Nancy to the club's board.\n\nNancy never got out of the blocks, his two wins from eight games coming in a flawed victory over bottom-of-the-table Livingston and a triumph over 10-man Aberdeen, who have also just sacked their manager.\n\nAll memory of Nancy's reign - if you want to call it that - will be shovelled under a carpet now by anybody and everybody culpable in the process of appointing him. If they're all true to recent form, none of them will speak, none will apologise, none will show humility by accepting that they got this woefully wrong.\n\nThe fans will have to make-do with a short written statement. Let them eat cake, in other words.\n\nNancy's laidback arrival - spending just 15 minutes talking with Martin O'Neill before ripping up everything O'Neill had done to stabilise things - was in stark contrast to the unceremonious manner of his exit. O'Neill, as interim, was there longer than Nancy.",

There becomes a slight desperation when you're looking to bring players in.\n\n\"But they definitely need some players just to have fresh faces in the dressing room because they need a bit of change at the moment.\n\n\"I do [think Nuno is the one to get them out of trouble].

    "description": "As Leeds aim to beat Manchester United in the Premier League for the first time since 2002, BBC Sport looks at their intense rivalry before Sunday's Elland Road meeting.",
    "fullText": "In his best-selling 'Managing My Life' autobiography, Sir Alex Ferguson reflected on his feelings about a trip to Elland Road.\n\n\"The crowd invariably give us the impression that a lynching would be too good for us,\" he said.\n\nAfter a typically fraught League Cup victory there in 2011, Ferguson offered this observation too.\n\n\"I have always said Liverpool-Manchester United games are fierce in many aspects,\" he added.\n\n\"But it never reaches the levels of Leeds United. Never.\"\n\nLeeds have already hosted a couple of historic rivals in December, beating Chelsea 3-1 at home and producing an epic fightback to snatch a point in a 3-3 draw against Liverpool.\n\nBut a visit from Manchester United is something else.\n\n\"I have a decorating firm and for 40 years we have had the motto that we will not use red paint,\" said lifelong Leeds fan Gary Edwards.\n\n\"We will paint over red free of charge. It's still going to this day. It's on all the business cards and letterheads.\"\n\nThe actual origins of the rivalry are difficult to pinpoint.\n\nMany feel it dates to the War of the Roses in the 15th century, although that is probably too simplistic given the Duchy and Dukedom of the Houses of York and Lancaster had little to do with the cities themselves and the Duchy of Lancaster had land and offices in Yorkshire.\n\nOthers think the rivalry has its origins in the industrial revolution which does, at least in part, correspond to the emergence of football as an organised sport - even if neither club, either originally as Leeds City and Newton Heath, or their current names, came to real prominence until after the Second World War.\n\nPossibly, the reverence from the 1950s and beyond for the Busby Babes compared to the negativity around Don Revie's team in the 1960s and 70s, is a factor.\n\nThe knowledge that key players - Johnny Giles, Gordon Strachan, Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Denis Irwin and Eric Cantona among them - left one club to become an integral part of the success of the other is another. Also, the proximity of the best supported teams from the two biggest cities in two neighbouring counties, separated geographically, by the Pennines.\n\nWhatever it is, the rivalry is real and despite the early 12:30 GMT kick-off, Elland Road is guaranteed to be a cauldron as Leeds look for their first home victory over Manchester United in the Premier League since 2002, when Harry Kewell scored the winner.\n\nFormer England goalkeeper Paul Robinson was in goal for Leeds that day and told BBC Sport: \"One hundred percent it feels different.\n\n\"You get to the stadium two hours before kick-off and certain areas are sectioned off. There are police here, you can't drive there. This road is closed, that road is closed.\n\n\"It is as intense as any derby that you want to name in this country - and it is not friendly.\n\n\"I grew up as a kid in the Leeds academy and was a ball boy at some games. The away section used to be in the cheese wedge in the corner of Elland Road. For most of the season, nobody wanted to be a ball boy in that corner. But when Manchester United came to town, everybody wanted to be over in that corner, for whatever reason.\n\n\"It was just a different game and a different experience.\"\n\nNeither manager has been part of a Leeds-Manchester United game before.\n\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke knows it is a game that means a lot for his club's fans and is talking about making \"dreams come true\".\n\nManchester United's Portuguese head coach Ruben Amorim has been at the centre of the Dérbi de Lisboa, as a player for Benfica and a coach at Lisbon rivals Sporting.\n\nHe is not sure the comparison is particularly helpful.\n\n\"I heard it is a big rivalry and a big derby,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"It is hard to compare different cultures, different derbies and different histories. It's a game in a hostile environment and that is going to be hard for any player. But when you play for Manchester United, you need to be ready for everything.\"\n\nLeeds' last title-winning campaign in 1992 was made more satisfying because they won it at the expense of Manchester United, who were in control of their own destiny until a run of three successive defeats in the space of seven days right at the end of the season let Howard Wilkinson's side in.\n\nSadly for Leeds, the post-script came the following November, when chief executive Bill Fotherby rang Manchester United counterpart Martin Edwards to ask about the chances of bringing full-back Irwin back to the club.\n\nFerguson was in the room and said no to Irwin leaving, but told Edwards to mention the availability of French forward Cantona. It was a call that changed the course of English footballing history.\n\n\"I've never forgiven Bill for that,\" says Gary Edwards.\n\nMaybe one of the reasons why Leeds' rivalry with Manchester United doesn't spring to mind in the same way as others in England is the relative infrequency of it happening.\n\nApart from the 14-year spell that began with Leeds' top-flight promotion in 1990 and relegation in 2004, the two clubs met only eight times in the other 30 years from 1982. Leeds won once in 2010, as a League One side at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, and lost on five occasions.\n\nThe two clubs' fans don't forget though.\n\n\"Even when Leeds were in League One and the Championship, Manchester United still sang a song about teams they didn't like and tagged 'and Leeds' on to it,\" said Robinson, who had six years at Leeds before joining Tottenham in 2004.\n\n\"Week in, week out, no matter what league they are in or who they are playing against, Leeds fans take great pride week in describing their dislike of Manchester United.\"\n\nLeeds go into the game in better form, having added a goalless New Year's Day draw draw at Anfield to their home comeback against Arne Slot's men to take their current unbeaten record to six games and seven points clear of relegation in 16th place. It is their best top-flight form since April 2021, when Marcelo Bielsa was in charge.\n\nRegardless, Robinson believes there are some Leeds fans for whom a successful season this time around would be to finish 17th and beat Manchester United.\n\n\"That does exist,\" said Gary Edwards. \"I'm not quite like that, but 100% there are fans who think that way.\n\n\"I just feel it is as good a time to play them as any because we have turned a corner.\n\n\"We've kept the same formation and the same players who looked dire at the start of the season are now assured and confident.\n\n\"It will make the game interesting. Very, very interesting.\"",

Over-promoted and out of his depth.\n\nA first half at Celtic Park that offered such promise made way for another second half of dismal collapse. They had Rangers on the ropes at the break but you always sensed that they needed a second goal to put them on the floor and maybe a third just to put them out for the count. These are Celtic's frailties these days. One goal is never enough.\n\nThose goals never came despite the chances they had. Once Rangers started to fight back, they hit Celtic with three blows in 21 minutes. Ruthless. The Celtic lights went out in an instant. From light to dark in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe colossal weaknesses in Nancy's formation, the giant amounts of space conceded by his players were the problem again. That and their inability to stay in the fight. Was their feeble demise a window to their collective soul, a reflection of their spirit under the new, and surely doomed, manager? It looked like that. A lost dressing room? Perhaps. Just because it's a cliche doesn't mean it isn't true.",

Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Schiffrin's record-breaking careers have elevated female skiing's profile above male skiing in many countries.\n\nCloser to home my co-presenter Chemmy Alcott was a consistent top-10 campaigner in alpine and Jenny Jones, Izzy and Zoe Atkin, Charlotte Bankes, Mia Brookes and Kirsty Muir have outshone the men, claiming numerous British firsts with World Cup, World Championship and X Games titles.\n\nJenny and Izzy have both won Olympic medals and it is impossible not to dream, looking at Mia, Kirsty, Charlotte and Zoe's form, that the 2026 Winter Games in Milan in February might produce Team GB's first ever gold on snow.",

The Argentina forward scored 91 goals in 2012.\n\nLamine Yamal is only 18 but it feels like he has been on the scene for a while as he regularly makes the headlines for his standout performances.\n\nHe shone for Spain as they won Euro 2024 last year and has continued to rise in 2025.\n\nThe teenager has seven goals and eight assists after 14 La Liga games for Barcelona so far this season.\n\nIn the first half of this year, he scored 11 goals and provided 10 assists for club and country.\n\nOusmane Dembele made an incredible start to 2025 as he scored 15 goals in his first eight games of the year on his way to finishing the 2024-25 campaign with 35 goals in 53 games - by far and away his best goalscoring form in any season.\n\nThe 28-year-old's performances on the pitch saw him win his first Ballon d'Or and although the goals haven't quite flowed as well so far this term, it has nevertheless been a brilliant year for the France forward.\n\nIt takes a brave person not to captain Erling Haaland in their Fantasy Premier League team because the Manchester City striker, 25, has been simply sensational in front of goal this season.\n\nHe has scored 25 goals in just 24 appearances this season while he was in equally deadly form for Norway as he helped them qualify for a first World Cup since 1998 by scoring 16 goals in their eight qualifiers.\n\nThis has been a difficult season so far for Cole Palmer with injury limiting his game time but he was the standout player at this summer's Club World Cup and was a key player for Chelsea last season.\n\nHe helped the Blues secure a return to the Champions League for this season, provided two vital assists as Chelsea beat Real Betis in the Conference League final and then was named player of the tournament at the Club World Cup, outshining some of the biggest teams and players in world football.\n\nPalmer, 23, scored three goals and provided two assists, with no other player surpassing his five goal involvements.\n\nGiven they won the Treble, Paris St-Germain players were always going to dominate this list.\n\nGoals and assists often grab the headlines but 23-year-old Nuno Mendes has cemented himself as one of the best left-backs in the world right now after some superb displays at full-back for PSG.\n\nGoalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who joined Manchester City from PSG in the summer, was named Fifa's best men's goalkeeper for 2025 earlier this month.\n\nThe Italy international was recognised for an exceptional year in which he won the Champions League for the first time and three domestic trophies with PSG.\n\nThe 26-year-old has since established himself as a key member of Pep Guardiola's City, who currently sit second in the Premier League and fourth in the Champions League.\n\nPedri, 23, who arguably enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career in 2024-25 as he helped Barcelona win the domestic treble, is now regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world.\n\nHe had the most recoveries (254) among players in the top five European leagues last term and also showed he is one of the best chance creators in Europe as he created 70 chances for his Barcelona team-mates last season.\n\nWith injury issues seemingly behind him, he is continuing to play an important part for Barcelona this season and has helped them to sit top of La Liga, ahead of rivals Real Madrid.\n\nIt has been a prolific 2025 for Kylian Mbappe, who has scored 59 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid this year.\n\nThis means the 27-year-old striker has equalled the record number of goals scored in a calendar year which was set by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013.\n\nGiven the unglamorous nature of the role, a defensive midfielder has to be very, very good to be considered the best player in the world, but Vitinha, 25, has certainly been very, very good in 2025.\n\nCompared to the legendary Andres Iniesta, Vitinha possesses brilliant technique and positioning which help him to dominate games from the middle of the park for Paris St-Germain.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Josh Baker's parents tell BBC Sport how watching England in Australia is helping them with their loss.",
    "fullText": "In the moment England secured an Ashes victory over Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Paul Baker shed a tear.\n\nThe last time England won in Melbourne, 15 years ago, Paul and his wife Lisa were in the city with seven-year-old son Josh – cricket-mad and his life ahead of him.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Josh would go on to play 47 games for Worcestershire. He tragically died from an undiagnosed heart condition at the age of 20 in May 2024.\n\nWithout him, Lisa and Paul are back in Australia. The stars of England's win at the MCG were Josh's old team-mates Josh Tongue and Jacob Bethell.\n\n\"It was a moment of reflection,\" Paul tells BBC Sport. \"It was lovely to see England win at the MCG. I've got fond memories of sharing the moment with Josh in 2010.\"\n\nThe Bakers are regular Ashes tourists. They first came to watch England down under for the 2002-03 series when Lisa was five months pregnant with Josh.\n\nPaul is a former second XI captain at Redditch Cricket Club. Lisa knew nothing of the game before she met Paul, but was soon indoctrinated. Cricket was always going to be a huge part of Josh's life, including witnessing the Melbourne and Sydney Tests on England's Ashes-winning tour in 2010-11.\n\n\"He loved the Barmy Army, the singing and the chanting,\" says Paul. \"His eyes were on stalks, capturing everything that was going on. We took him to the Barmy Army pub one night and he loved it.\"\n\nThe Bakers have strong ties to Australia. The family has housed Australian overseas players and Josh played in Sydney during the winter before he passed away.\n\nFor the first Ashes without Josh, there was nowhere else Lisa and Paul wanted to be.\n\n\"Life is too short,\" says Lisa. \"Josh was an only child. We just thought 'let's do it'.\n\n\"It's tough because the memories keep popping up on my phone. They're wonderful, but they absolutely break your heart. I look back at them and that was when we were happy. That's so difficult. Not that we're not happy now, but it's very different.\"",

Really not bothered. You guys pay for tickets and you pay for my prize so thanks for booing me,\" the 18-year-old told Sky Sports following his victory.\n\n\"No-one wanted me to win but I proved them wrong yet again.\"\n\nBelgium's Mike de Decker, the world number 18 and 2024 World Grand Prix champion, complained on Instagram about the boos after he was beaten in the first round by unranked Kenyan David Munyua.\n\nHe said that booing \"shouldn't be something that's normal or supported\".\n\nLittler has previously been subjected to booing in overseas tournaments and world number nine Gerwyn Price famously wore ear defenders in 2023 to block out the crowd noise.",

One lucky fan in attendance will also receive £60,000 from the tournament sponsor, as will Prostate Cancer UK.\n\nWhat is dartitis and what causes it?\n\nLittler entered as favourite off the back of winning six major finals in 2025.\n\nLuke Humphries, Littler's predecessor as both world champion and world number one, faced Littler in three finals this year and is the current world number two.\n\nWorld number three Michael van Gerwen is also in the mix, looking to avenge last year's final defeat and add to his three world titles, with his most recent coming in 2019.\n\nYoung players making a big run at the World Championship include Josh Rock and Gian van Veen, whose respective form saw them both enter the world's top 12 before the tournament.\n\nBeau Greaves topped this year's Women's Series and carried the highest hopes of becoming only the second female player to win a match in the tournament, after Fallon Sherrock won twice at the event in December 2019.\n\nShe took 22nd seed Daryl Gurney to a deciding set but just fell short of a place in the second round.\n\nThree qualification places were on offer from the Women's Series, along with a spot for the Women's Matchplay winner, a title taken by Lisa Ashton.\n\nAshton lost 3-0 to 2023 world champion Michael Smith in the first round on 11 December.\n\nWith Greaves qualifying in her own right as runner-up on the development tour, that meant Women's Series runner-up Sherrock, Noa-Lynn van Leuven in fourth and Gemma Hayter, who finished fifth, joined third-placed Ashton.\n\nVan Leuven, who became the first transgender player to appear at the tournament last year, was beaten by two-time champion Peter Wright this time.\n\nSherrock lost in straight sets in the first round to Dave Chisnall, while Hayter took a set off Northern Ireland's World Cup winner Rock in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nThe format is set play, unlike other tournaments which are a race to a number of legs.\n\nA set consists of the best of five legs or race to three.\n\nOnly in matches where players are level on sets and legs in the deciding set do players need to win by two clear legs.\n\nFirst and second round: Best of five sets\n\nThird and fourth round: Best of seven sets\n\nQuarter-finals: Best of nine sets\n\nPhil Taylor is the most successful player in the history of the PDC World Darts Championship, winning 14 of his 16 world titles between 1995 and 2013.\n\nHis previous two titles came before a group of leading players broke away from the British Darts Organisation to form their own governing body, now known as the PDC, in 1993.\n\nThe past five years have produced five different world champions, with English trio Littler, Humphries and Smith winning the past three.\n\nLittler and Humphries will hope to join the exclusive club of players to have won multiple PDC world titles, with only six managing to achieve that feat so far.\n\nTwo players hit nine-darters during the 2025 World Darts Championship.\n\nDutchman Christian Kist was the first player to hit one, doing so in a first-round defeat by Madars Razma.\n\nAustralia's Damon Heta hit one in the third round, but like Kist it came in a defeat as he went out to Luke Woodhouse.\n\nThroughout the tournament, there will be daily round-ups on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be live text coverage of the biggest matches as the tournament progresses.\n\nDuring Thursday's opening night, there was a dedicated preview show on BBC Radio 5 Live, featuring interviews with Littler, Humphries and Van Gerwen. Presenter James Gregg will provide updates on BBC Sounds throughout the competition.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nAsk Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.\n\nWe want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.\n\nThe team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.\n\nWe will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.\n\nOur coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.\n\nHow do darts world rankings work?\n\nWho is Arsenal teenager Salmon?\n\nWhy is Steve Smith wearing black tape under his eyes?\n\nWhen is the FA Cup third round draw?",

    "fullText": "From a certain vantage point, the health of Test cricket in South Africa appears terminal.\n\nFor the first time since sporting isolation during apartheid, there will be no red-ball action in the country this summer. Instead, fans must make do watching Indian-owned T20 franchises compete in the SA20.\n\nThe next time the Proteas take the field in whites on home soil will be October 2026, 21 months after hosting Pakistan in January this year.\n\nAnd yet the Test team itself has rarely looked in better shape, with 2025 proving a watershed year.\n\nRyan Rickelton registered his country's first double century for nine years as Pakistan were swept 2–0. In June, a sublime fourth-innings 136 from Aiden Markram, allied to a nine-wicket match haul from Kagiso Rabada, carried South Africa to a five-wicket victory over Australia in the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's.\n\nAnd with the choker's tag finally dislodged, and momentum behind them, South Africa are on track to qualify for another WTC final.\n\nWiaan Mulder threatened Brian Lara's record for the highest Test score when he declared himself on 367 against Zimbabwe in July. In October, Keshav Maharaj bagged a seven-for in Rawalpindi to square the series with Pakistan.\n\nA month later, Simon Harmer claimed 17 wickets in two Tests as South Africa beat India 2-0 in their own backyard, becoming the first South African team to win away in India since 2000.\n\n\"It's been a remarkable period for us,\" says Sunuran Muthusamy, the spin-bowling all-rounder who scored his maiden century in the 408-run win in the second Test against India.\n\n\"We're straight into the SA20 so it's hard to really take stock. But in the small moments when we've had a chance to reflect, we know that we've found a great formula. It feels like things are really clicking.\"",

    "fullText": "I was in absolute shock when I saw the news that Anthony Joshua had been involved in a car accident in which two men had died.\n\nI saw it come through as breaking news on BBC World, so I made some calls and unfortunately my fears were realised that the men who had died included a close member of his team.\n\nAJ always travels with close friends who are a part of his team. There are four or five of them, and it could have been any of those.\n\nI was with them all just 10 days ago in Miami - both Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele, the men who have died, were there for his fight with Jake Paul. It's heartbreaking.\n\nThese were not casual members of his team either. These were really close friends and key parts of his backroom team, so there was more than one element to their relationship with AJ.\n\nWe know Ghami, who runs a gym in London, has been around AJ for about 10 years. He was an integral part of the team, as his strength and conditioning coach.\n\nAyodele has been around even longer. He was a friend who trained alongside the former world heavyweight champion, and was with him all the time.\n\nIf you do the most basic of searches on social media, it will reveal the three of them together. It always seemed to be the three of them together. That's what makes this all so heartbreaking.",

    "description": "BBC Sport picks out boxing fights we want to happen in 2026 including a long-awaited heavyweight showdown between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury, and Caroline Dubois up against fellow Briton Terri Harper.",
    "fullText": "Every new year brings great expectations and hopes for boxing fans.\n\nWill we see the biggest fights? Are we finally going to get Anthony Joshua v Tyson Fury? Who will emerge as the next big star?\n\nHere BBC Sport picks out some bouts we want to see in 2026.\n\nRight it's the big one and the serial heartbreaker – Joshua v Fury.\n\nWe've come close before, several times, but this time we are filled with renewed optimism the heavyweight super-fight will happen.\n\nForget the fact neither man is world champion or that Fury, 37, has been retired for a year, or the fight is a few years late with Joshua now 36, we'd still really like to see it.\n\nIt would be a seminal moment for the two best British heavyweights of their era to face each other.\n\nAnd if it does happen, we expect it to be in the UK at the end of 2026.\n\nLightweight world champion Caroline Dubois is quickly emerging as the next major talent. Now aligned with Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), she made her promotional debut in December with an impressive win against Camilla Panatta.\n\nSurely unification fights are next for the 24-year-old and who is a better option than fellow Briton and WBO belt holder Terri Harper?\n\nThe pair don't seem to be the biggest fans of each other but now they're under the same promotional banner.\n\nBoth fight at pace and it has all the makings of a British boxing classic - never mind the fact they're both world champions.\n\nUnified super-featherweight Alycia Baumgardner is also an intriguing and fun option for either woman, although the 31-year-old American beat Harper in a title bout back in 2021.\n\nLight-welterweight Adam Azim will be in action live on BBC Two against Argentine Gustavo Daniel Lemos on 31 January, but it really is just about time for the unbeaten 23-year-old Briton to make a big step up.\n\nSheffield's Dalton Smith is a brilliant fight for Azim. The 28-year-old challenges for a world title on 10 January against Subriel Matias.\n\nShould Smith win, Slough-born Azim could face him in a world championship contest, but defeat would make it a massive must-win all-British encounter.\n\nThis is the fight for the boxing purists. Former bantamweight world champion Junto Nakatani's move to super-bantamweight in December was basically to pave the way for an all-Japanese world title super-fight with Naoya Inoue.\n\nMultiple world champion Inoue, 32, is widely considered the standout fighter in any weight division. No-one has got close to 'The Monster', but perhaps the 27-year-old Nakatani will be the man to do it.\n\nBoth are unbeaten, with 51 knockouts between them, and it could be a fight for the ages.\n\nWe were expecting this fight to happen in 2025, but boxing politics appeared to get in the way.\n\nLauren Price, 31, has been impeccable since turning professional and is already a unified champion at welterweight after just nine fights.\n\nThe only belt she doesn't have, Mikaela Mayer does. Unable to defend that WBO title against Price, Mayer casually jumped up to light-middleweight to become a three-weight world champion.\n\nMayer's success adds to the intrigue of a showdown with Price and the outspoken American, 35, may produce some verbal fireworks from the usually calm Welsh boxer.\n\nFabio Wardley is living the dream as a white-collar boxer turned heavyweight world champion.\n\nThe 31-year-old will be expected to have a low-risk first defence of his WBO title, but we'd really love to see the big-hitting Ipswich man in the ring with the division's brightest prospect in 20-year-old Moses Itauma.\n\nThey are likely to be two of the biggest figures in British boxing over the next five years and seem certain to meet at some stage.\n\nWhy not now, when Wardley has a world title to his name?\n\nConor Benn v Ryan Garcia or Lewis Crocker\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at the key questions going into the divisive Battle of the Sexes-style match between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Love it or loathe it, the Battle of the Sexes-style event between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios has caused quite the stir.\n\nSabalenka, the women's world number one, faces 2022 Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios in an exhibition match on 28 December.\n\nThe event will be shown live on BBC One from 15:45 GMT.\n\nBBC Sport looks at the key questions going into the divisive match.\n\n'Battle of the Sexes' will not damage women's sport - Sabalenka\n\n'Mine was for social change, this is not' - King on Battle of the Sexes\n\nIf any women's player is going to beat Kyrgios, then you would expect it to be Sabalenka.\n\nThe 27-year-old Belarusian won four titles - including the US Open - and reached five other finals in a productive 2025 season.\n\nSabalenka has been one of the most effective servers this season, sitting in the top five for service games won, and has powerful groundstrokes.\n\nThe four-time major singles champion has the ability to hit through opponents, though she is still prone to being erratic from the baseline.\n\nOver the past season, where she won 59 of her 71 matches, Sabalenka has looked to introduce more variety into her game with drop-shots and coming forward to the net.\n\n\"I feel I will be more prepared than this guy,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\nThe exhibition will be the best of three sets, with a 10 point tie-breaker if it goes to a decider.\n\nAccording to organisers Evolve, data shows women players move about 9% slower on average than men, so the dimensions of Sabalenka's side of the court will be 9% smaller.\n\nEach player will only receive one serve in an attempt to restrict Kyrgios' power and speed advantage. He thinks that is the biggest leveller.\n\n\"You're taking my strength completely out of it,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Obviously she has a great serve herself, but from the back of the court things are a bit more even.\n\n\"The men's game is heavily reliant and dominated by first serve percentage and holding serve quite easy.\n\n\"So if you take that away the game becomes a bit more of a grind from the baseline and I think that slightly goes in her favour.\"\n\nSome see the match as harmless entertainment that will attract a newer, younger audience in the age of social media.\n\nOthers believe it is a misguided venture and, if Sabalenka loses, will create an opportunity for women's tennis to be belittled.\n\n\"I am not putting myself at any risk. We're there to have fun and bring great tennis. Whoever wins, wins,\" she said.\n\n\"It's so obvious that the man is biologically stronger than the woman, but it's not about that.\n\n\"This event is only going to help bring women's tennis to a higher level.\"\n\nCritics have questioned Kyrgios' suitability as the male protagonist, given he admitted assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2021 and has made a series of comments which have been considered misogynistic.\n\nKyrgios says he has not given \"one thought\" about the event potentially fuelling criticism of women's sport, and insists he is not concerned about losing.\n\n\"I'm never worried. I know how I've responded with things in my life,\" the former world number 13 said.\n\n\"This is all a bonus. I've lost tennis matches before, so it's not really a big deal.\"\n\nWith his booming first serve, easy power from the baseline and creative shot-making, Kyrgios' talent has never been in doubt.\n\nHis temperament has been questioned - as has his fitness in recent years.\n\nKyrgios missed most of the 2023 season and the entire 2024 campaign with a wrist injury that the Australian's surgeon thought would end his career.\n\nThe 30-year-old returned to action at January's Australian Open but has not played an ATP Tour singles match since March because of a knee injury.\n\n\"In the past year I've had to have some serious conversations with myself about how much I want to dedicate myself,\" he said.\n\n\"I was asking myself if I really wanted to put myself in a pressure cooker – every time I go out there is a lot of expectation.\n\n\"But I feel great. Now I'm in my 30s, I have to start looking after my body a little better.\n\n\"I know if I can play best of three with a tie-break that's a long way from where I was a year and a half ago.\"\n\nCynics have wondered exactly what the point of the event is.\n\nSabalenka and Kyrgios insist it is to attract a different audience to the sport, with an emphasis on fun, entertainment and celebrity culture.\n\n\"There are question marks - and that scares people,\" Kyrgios said.\n\n\"For us, it is exciting and gives us that thrill. I think events like this need to happen \n\nThe event, being held at the 17,000-seater Coca-Cola Arena, is on track to be sold out.\n\nTickets range from about £100 in the upper tier stands to upwards of £600 on courtside benches.\n\n\"Sport and entertainment is the same thing – people come to watch sport for the unknown, that's why it is not played on paper,\" Kyrgios said.\n\n\"Whether it's good or bad, they want to remember something they are going to see in everyday life.\"\n\nBillie Jean King, who beat Bobby Riggs in the second Battle of the Sexes match in 1973, hopes it will be a \"great\" match but says it is \"not the same\" as her era-defining event.\n\nKing's victory over former Wimbledon champion Riggs - a 55-year-old self-proclaimed chauvinist - was a landmark moment in the fight for gender equality and laid the path for equal pay at the top of the game.\n\n\"Ours was about social change; culturally, where we were in 1973. This one is not,\" King told BBC Sport.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "David Storch wants to be the next owner of Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nHaving made a bid to buy the Owls last Friday, Storch faces competition from two other parties, including former Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley.\n\nBut who is he, and what is his plan for the Hillsborough club?\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BBC Sheffield, the American introduced himself and his vision - which appears to be very different from that of former owner Dejphon Chansiri.\n\n\"We have a desire to do things right, that means setting the tone at the top,\" Storch said.\n\n\"Having excellence in everything we do and a quality product — at the stadium, the training ground and academy.\n\n\"We'll bring in the right CEO (chief executive officer). We want to make sure we bring in the right sporting director.\"\n\nChansiri would often baulk at the idea of a sporting director and the club has not had a CEO since Katrien Meire left in 2019.\n\nStorch and Ashley are believed to be joined by Dunfermline owner James Bord in the running to take over at Wednesday.\n\nThe Championship club entered administration in October, which ended Chansiri's decade-long ownership.\n\nJoint-administrator Kris Wigfield said in a statement last Friday that \"genuine progress is being made\" to name a preferred bidder but with 2026 on the horizon, it is unclear who will lead the club into the future.\n\nStorch, who has also worked in the aviation services industry, is the founder and managing partner of investment firm Arise Capital Partners, working alongside his son Michael.\n\nBut why are they trying to buy one of English football's most recognisable yet troubled football clubs?\n\n\"When we went to the Wednesday game on 5 November (against Norwich), I just couldn't believe the atmosphere, the energy, the singing, the fan engagement,\" Storch said.\n\n\"Here's a team that not only is in the cellar, but you know, for certain, about to be relegated due to the point deductions.\n\n\"We came away unbelievably excited about what we saw.\"\n\nAs it happens, Storch has come close to buying several English Football League (EFL) clubs.\n\n\"We started focusing on US sports and then we started looking at English football about two-and-a-half years ago,\" he said.\n\n\"We've given serious consideration to three different clubs. We did go down the path with Rob Couhig at Reading. We took a look at Blackpool, although we quickly dismissed that one.\n\n\"Then we submitted an offer team with Gareth Bale to buy Cardiff City and actually reached agreement with Vincent Tan to purchase the club. Unfortunately, he decided to hold on and we never got that transaction complete.\"\n\nSheffield Wednesday placed in administration\n\nSheff Wed delay move to name preferred bidder\n\nSheff Wed 'days from takeover' with Ashley leading contender\n\nTaking on Sheffield Wednesday would be a significant challenge. It is a club that has not been in the Premier League for 25 years.\n\nIn that period they have been relegated to League One three times and, given their points deductions in the Championship this season, they will almost certainly make that four.\n\nBut Storch has said he has done his homework and has a clear strategy should he take over the club.\n\n\"You'll see that we have a blueprint for proper governance, fan engagement, financial stability, sustainability and football strategy,\" he said.\n\n\"I've bought into it 100% and I've insisted that all of my partners here, all of my team that's surrounding me, that they buy into that as well.\n\n\"I think the academy is critical to our strategy. We'll look to make improvements there so that players can have the right environment in which to train.\"\n\nThere had been talk of Storch joining forces with another American businessman, John McEvoy - but he revealed his bid for Wednesday has been made in partnership with Tom Costin, the co-founder and managing partner of Owl Ventures.\n\nThe company, whose name is a coincidence and not linked to Wednesday's nickname, describes itself as \"the largest venture capital firm in the world focused on education technology with over $2 billion assets under management\".\n\nCostin is an investor with the Blue Crow Sports Group - a multi-club football ownership and investment platform with controlling interests in French club Le Havre, Spanish side CD Leganes and Cancun FC in Mexico. Costin is also a board director at Le Havre.\n\n\"We recognise that this is a long journey - this is not a short term fix,\" Storch added.\n\n\"We have confidence between Tom and I, that between us, we have enough capital to get this thing going, and our plan is that as we sustain the team, and as we start making progress on the pitch, get back up in the Championship, it will be possible for us to go ahead and raise additional capital.\n\n\"I'm not doing this to own a football club. I'm doing this to make a difference. I want to give people something to feel proud about.\"\n\nStorch confirmed he made an offer for the club on Friday and said he is now waiting to hear from the administrators.\n\nThe main topic of discussion among fans currently is whether the preferred bidder will meet the EFL's '25p in the pound' rule - which requires that a club exiting administration must pay its unsecured creditors a minimum of 25p for every pound owed - to avoid a further 15-point deduction in the future.\n\n\"We've put in an offer. We feel that it's a fair offer and satisfies our interpretation of the rules and the laws of the land,\" Storch said.\n\n\"We will not move forward with a 15-point deduction. The offer that we've put in has a requirement that stipulates that we will not accept the 15-point reduction.\"\n\nThere were also recent reports suggesting the process involving the EFL's 'Owners' and Directors' Test' - plus the introduction of a new football regulator - could be a long one.\n\nWhile Storch was CEO of AAR, an aviation services company, an employee reportedly bribed the Nepalese and South African governments, leading to the company agreeing a $55m settlement in 2024.\n\nWill that be a stumbling block?\n\n\"My lawyer doesn't think so,\" Storch said.\n\n\"The circumstances that happened at the company were rather unfortunate. I have a 40-year business career that is unblemished. This was a lower-level employee that did some things they shouldn't have done. The company self-reported it.\n\n\"What I'm all about here is giving the fans something really exceptional, and restoring the past glory. I've never been rejected from anything in my life.\"\n\nLatest Sheffield Wednesday news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Sheffield Wednesday content on BBC Sounds",

He is highly rated for his pace, strength and directness.\n\nCity are in the Premier League title race with Arsenal, and signing the 25-year-old would boost their chances of success this season.\n\nThey are currently just two points behind the Gunners in the league table after a run of five consecutive wins.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot has faced challenge after challenge this season, from Liverpool's horrid run of nine defeats in 12 to Mohamed Salah's explosive interview at Leeds.\n\nHow Slot deals without Alexander Isak is the next big question.\n\nThe Swede has hardly had a flying start to life at Anfield since making the £125m move from Newcastle in the summer, but the movement and finish for his goal against Tottenham on Saturday showed exactly why Liverpool signed him.\n\n\"You need to be at the top of the game to impact a game. And it took months before we could bring him up. We always knew it would take him time. And that's why it's so unlucky that he's now injured,\" said Slot.\n\n\"We all saw he was getting closer and closer to the player that he was last season at Newcastle.\"\n\nSlot said it is a \"long injury\" and Isak would be out for \"a couple of months\" and that is probably the best case scenario for Liverpool. It will, in all likelihood, be March by the time Isak can play football again.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Liverpool will make a move for another attacker in January, with expensive solutions to short-term problems not part of the club model.\n\nHugo Ekitike is also thriving with eight league goals this season, with Slot saying the 23-year-old has \"already adapted to the Premier League.\"\n\nAsked about the possibility of recalling Harvey Elliott - who hasn't played since October - from Aston Villa, Slot said: \"Harvey is an Aston Villa player and he is supposed to be going there for a year. If the question is about him then the best thing to ask is at Villa, who are doing quite well by the way.\"\n\nIsak has only made 10 starts for Liverpool since signing but with him now out of contention and Salah away on duty at the African Cup of Nations, Slot may be forced into a tactical restructure to deal with the Swede's absence.",

Australia have lost seven such wickets - once in every 64 defensive shots.\n\nEngland's hyped - and hyper-fast - pace attack shone in dismissing Australia for 132 in their first innings of the first Test in Perth, but have struggled to be as effective since.\n\nIn the first 30 overs of an innings with the new ball, Australia's pace bowlers have taken 32 wickets at an average of 22.8, compared to 23 at 32.2 by England.\n\nEngland's declining threat with the new ball could be partly explained by their inability to find the correct length to bowl at on each surface since that first day in Perth.\n\nComplaints from commentators and pundits that England have frequently bowled too short are backed up by comparing the sides' accuracy on hitting a good length - defined as 5-7m from the stumps.\n\nAustralia's bowlers have landed 30% of their deliveries in this zone throughout the series, with England doing so just 23% of the time, and have therefore put the tourists' batters under more sustained pressure.\n\nEven before Marnus Labuschagne decided to have a one-man competition with himself for screamer of the series, Australia have been clearly superior in the field.\n\nThe hosts have taken 47 and dropped eight of 55 chances - a success rate of 85% compared to England's 77% (33 catches, 10 drops).\n\nHalf of England's dropped chances happened during a miserable day two of the second Test at the Gabba...\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Tell a room of Tartan Army members that there is a forgotten Scotland striker with eight goals in his past nine English Championship games and you will get attention.\n\nThen mention the name Oli McBurnie and watch noses turn up at the thought of the Hull City forward ever returning to Steve Clarke's squad.\n\nThe former Sheffield United man, who has failed to score in 17 caps, endured a challenging relationship with the fanbase while representing Scotland between 2018 and 2021.\n\nHe has not kicked a ball for the national team in almost five years, but it is becoming difficult to ignore the form of the 29-year-old, who scored his 10th goal in all competitions for promotion-chasing Hull on Saturday.\n\n\"I have said many times before that to play for your country is the pinnacle of football for me,\" McBurnie said, external after scoring the winner in the weekend victory over West Brom.\n\n\"The only way I can get back into that squad is to keep performing for Hull City and keep scoring as many goals as I can to make that decision for the manager as difficult as possible.\n\n\"But that is my ultimate goal, to get back into the Scotland squad.\"",
