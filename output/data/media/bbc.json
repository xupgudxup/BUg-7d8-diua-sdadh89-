    "fullText": "Editor’s note: This article contains spoilers for each series of the UK and U.S. editions of The Traitors\n\nThe winner of the fourth series of Traitors UK will not be the psychologist, either of the two barristers — one turned bestselling crime author — or the retired police detective.\n\nThe wild irony of The Traitors, the final of which will be aired on the BBC this evening, is that a social deduction game based around reading people, gathering evidence, and presenting a case never seems to favour people who have spent a career building those skills.\n\nThe aforementioned detective got the whole thing so spectacularly wrong that the only player she pledged her trust to was a traitor.\n\nHow can you look away? Almost 12 million people watched the series four premiere in the UK this month, and the U.S. fourth season has already beaten the premiere of season three. Outwardly, Traitors is a game of deception — the titular ‘traitors’ must eliminate the ‘faithfuls’, by murder and manipulation, while faithfuls must hunt out the traitors and vote to banish them — but it is really a proving ground for every soft skill ever listed on LinkedIn.\n\nEach year, contestants from scores of different industries — diplomacy, medicine, politics, military, teaching — profess theirs has equipped them best to succeed on a show which offers a cash prize to the winning contestant. Which raises the question: how well would football prepare you for the Traitors?\n\nThere are parallels between both, according to Traitors UK series one contestant Dr Amos Ogunkoya, a GP and sports medicine doctor who was previously the club doctor at Luton Town (then in the Premier League) and Colchester United.\n\n“When you’re in the castle, there’s so much noise,” he told The Athletic. “Everyone is throwing out theories. (The edit) focuses on one or two, but there are 10, 30, 50 every day.\n\n“You have to trust your gut a lot more. When you’re working in the Premier League, I can’t explain to you how much noise there is. It’s global noise, and inside, everyone’s got people in their ear. Comfort in that noise and comfort in who you are is really important.\n\n“Football environments are difficult things because, especially at the higher level, they induce — quite similar to The Traitors — a level of paranoia. For a lot of people at the top level, there’s a lot of competition: is (there) someone else in the shadows that wants to take that position from you? The people who rise to the top tend to be the people whom people like.\n\n“The best faithfuls are the ones who adopt the siege mentality. It’s almost like a relegation scrap: ‘We know who we are, and everyone thinks we’re stupid, and everyone thinks we’re gonna go down’. That’s the best way you quickly suss out who’s on your side. I probably got murdered because I was (valuing) cohesion and leadership.”\n\nSuch is the cruelty of The Traitors, the game does not always reward those players the audience perceives as having worked the hardest.\n\nContestants must constantly walk the tightrope between self-preservation and confrontation. Some, like faithful Harriet in UK series 4, swiftly go in two-footed with their accusations, while others hide their suspicions from the traitors to stay in the game. That exercise in diplomacy — how and when to speak — takes place every day in dressing rooms up and down the country.\n\n“Sometimes, there’s no other option other than to go for someone and really say: ‘That’s not on, you’re not behaving in the right way’,” said Wales Women centurion Helen Ward, now head of women’s football at Watford. “You have to bring it up, particularly if you are captain or head coach. You’ve got a responsibility to the rest of the group to call it out.\n\n“I’ve really been lucky to have some brilliant team-mates, but there’s always the occasion where you think: what are they doing behind my back? If it’s another striker, are they trying to bring me down to other people to make themselves look better?\n\n“There’s competition for places, but then there’s being a little bit sneaky about it.\n\n“You know they’re doing things to elevate their own career, and that maybe comes with some behaviours that not everybody would necessarily agree with or do themselves. That certainly would come up from time to time in teams. If you’ve been around that and you’ve picked up on things that people do when they think no one’s watching, that could be a trait that lends itself well to solving The Traitors.”\n\nJake Brown, winner of UK series three, attributed his victory in part to skills gained as a Para Lion with the England cerebral palsy football team. Brown represented England at European and world championships and trained at England’s base at St George’s Park in Staffordshire. That ingrained consistency was crucial in the show, he said.\n\n“If you change your behaviour or character a lot, that’s often seen as traitor behaviour,” he said. “I always used to think: one day, be loud; one day, be quiet. I was trying to get that see-saw balance.\n\n“One of my managers at England used to tell me: ‘KISS — Keep it simple, stupid’. I took that saying into the castle with me. The first couple of days: don’t do anything complicated. Normally, the first thing you think about is the best. That saying goes on the football pitch: the first pass or the first action you see is normally the best course of action.\n\n“When people start to get banished and murdered, that’s when you need to think outside the box, and think a couple of days ahead. If I say this, how will people react? If you’re saying something without a long-term goal in mind, you might get caught out.”\n\nCoaches and managers, of course, must be alert to the moment the courage of their convictions tips into delusion. By the same token, the most galling reverse came in the UK final of The Celebrity Traitors. Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed formed an early alliance with former England rugby union player Joe Marler based on their shared suspicions of comedian and traitor Alan Carr, only to falter and banish Marler at the final round table in favour of Carr.\n\n“My jaw dropped when that happened,” said Jay Sadler, the head coach of WSL 2 side Portsmouth Women. “I couldn’t believe he changed and switched on someone that he formed an alliance with.\n\n“Elite managers have that strength in their convictions and they know exactly what they’re chasing. Sometimes, you look and think, do we stick? Do we need to have more adaptability to win? I’d rather look back and be glad I made a bold move that I felt strategically was the right one than stick with the same, hoping for a different result.\n\n“The difference is I’ve got a multidisciplinary team that I can lean on — analysts and assistant coaches that I know are here for the right reasons. Can you trust everyone on The Traitors? That’s why I think you have to be a little bit more cut-throat with sticking to your own game and your own guns than in football. If you are going off limited information, stick to what you know and stick to your gut.”\n\nThe most galling example of misplaced trust came in the UK series two finale, when disability model Mollie Pearce’s friendship with traitor and eventual winner Harry Clark won out over a more logical alliance with faithful Jaz Singh.\n\n“The interesting thing is they all think, after being together for three or four days, that they know each other inside out,” said Stephen Warnock, the former Liverpool and Blackburn defender turned BBC and Sky pundit.\n\n“You haven’t got a clue who you’re talking to, but people do get blinkers on and forget it’s a game. That’s the one thing that footballers would definitely remember, and I think they’d be quite cut-throat if it meant axing someone or calling someone out. The other side of it is if you had someone who is an ex-captain or a senior player going into the Traitors, they could be seen as a little bit bossy, commanding and trying to lead people. That could be seen as a positive or a negative.”\n\nWarnock pointed out that footballers may have years together compared to the weeks Traitors contestants spend in the Scottish castle. That makes for a more delicate and significant balancing of emotions. Equally, football coaches tread a constant line: building an honest environment while protecting the group, which sometimes necessitates a kind of deception.\n\n“What I’ve learned now is that football management is a bit like acting,” continued Sadler. “You’re going up in front of the cameras and the media want to talk to you, but you already know what you want to tell them — you just manipulate whatever questions are asked and give the answer that you want to portray to the players, staff, and stakeholders.\n\n“The biggest thing in leadership is being honest and being able to build trust. Deception kind of conflicts with that. (In the game), the balance will be key.”\n\nIt is rare that a post-game interview will be as confrontational as a Traitors roundtable, but journalists must be able to ask the hard questions while preserving long-term relationships.\n\n“With football, you know it is just a game, but when it starts getting nasty, or things aren’t going their way, (managers) are still people, so it’s a fine line to tread,” said Sky Sports presenter Michelle Owen.\n\n“(With) The Traitors, I can’t believe this year how there have been so many things (discussed at the roundtable) and then the next day, no one mentions them. You need to bank stuff in your memory. In our job, those little things are so important.”\n\nUltimately, though, The Traitors remains such a difficult show to navigate. Everyone thinks they’re good at reading people until somebody proves them wrong — a bad business partner, a dishonest spouse — and those instincts are tested in a game whose premise often feels illogical.\n\n“You have to be comfortable being wrong,” said Ogunkoya, which sums up the irony of the game. “In any professional sport, you make mistakes, adjust and you don’t have an ego when it comes to it. People can go in (the show) and think they’re good at reading people, become really rigid, and that makes them easy to trick.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSoccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa are monitoring the situation of Fulham attacker Harry Wilson ahead of the winter transfer window deadline, according to the BBC. Aston Villa manager Unai Emery wants to bolster his options in the final third at the Villa Park club and would love to sign the Wales international. Wilson is out of contract at the end of the season, and Fulham are desperate to get the 28-year-old to extend his deal. However, the Villans target prefers to get clarity on the future of Fulham head coach Marco Silva, who is also out of contract in the summer, before deciding over any new deal.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Craven Cottage club will be open to selling Wilson this window, but he could be available for a decent fee if they do. He will be a free agent at the end of the season if he does not extend his deal and more clubs will join the Villans if he becomes available by then. The former Liverpool star has been involved in 13 goals so far this term, with eight goals and five assists to his name in 25 games. Wilson ended last term with six goals and two assists in 25 league games and Villa could do with his quality and experience as they target a top-four finish this season.\n\nGetting him this window could prove tricky for the Midlands club as Fulham are unlikely to be open to losing such a player midway through the season. Villa will also be facing competition from the likes of Brentford, Everton and Crystal Palace for Wilson if he becomes available by any chance this month.\n\nThey have signed Brazilian forward Alysson from Gremio in a £10 million deal, while Leon Bailey has been recalled from his loan at AS Roma, with Donyell Malen joining the Serie A club.",

    "fullText": "In BBC Sport's new Eat & Yap series, Alex Scott meets some of the best Women's Super League players to share the food they love and grew up eating, and talk about life on and off the pitch.\n\nWatch the interview in full now on BBC iPlayer\n\nOlivia Smith will forever be the women's game's first seven-figure player.\n\nAged 15, she won her first senior Canada cap while playing college football in her homeland.\n\nAged 18, she signed her first professional contract with Portuguese club Sporting, announcing her arrival with a goal and an assist on her debut.\n\nAged 19, she moved to the Women's Super League (WSL) to play for fallen giants Liverpool, starring on the right wing as the two-time champions avoided relegation back to the second tier.\n\nIn July 2025, European champions Arsenal broke the broke the world record to bring 20-year-old Smith to north London.\n\nIn the first episode of Eat & Yap the Arsenal and Canada superstar sat down with Alex Scott to tuck into some tasty dishes that reflect her life growing up in Canada and her Caribbean roots, while revealing her footballing idols, a love of Yorkshire puddings and much more.\n\nAlex Scott: So I was told I have to bring maple syrup.\n\nOlivia Smith: Yeah, you're a gem. Maple syrup. Lovely. First of all, I always have, for example, pancakes before a match. I just like pancakes and I always need to have maple syrup. Honestly, I eat this with everything.\n\nAlex: When was the last time you were actually at home in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Oh - probably in the summer, as I spent my Christmas here.\n\nAlex: What do you think of home? Can you build a picture for me of what life was like for you growing up back home?\n\nOlivia: I have a younger sister, so we grew up together. My family were all kind of goofballs I would say. So just playing games a lot, we're always outside, we have dogs as well. So I've grown up with dogs and just go to the park, play football, play with the dogs. That's kind of like what a typical day would look like.\n\nAlex: So your sister plays football?\n\nAlex: What position does she play?\n\nOlivia: Midfielder, winger, striker.\n\nAlex: So does she look up to you and want to follow in your footsteps?\n\nOlivia: I hope so, but she claims she's better than me!\n\nAlex: Does she literally watch your games and say \"You should have been doing this\" or \"You should have scored that goal\"?\n\nOlivia: Yes - she sends me snapchats of my game and says \"Why did you do that?\" I'm like, well, \"What would you have done?\"\n\nAlex: What did she think when you made your move to Arsenal?\n\nOlivia: She was so excited. I mean she also looks up to a team like Arsenal, she loves watching me play so then for me to get the opportunity and really be a role model for her playing with girls like Alessia [Russo] and Leah [Williamson], it's amazing. She's really excited for me.\n\nAlex: Who do you look up to back in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Christine Sinclair. She's a huge legend in the game of course, and also Marta. Then I love watching the men's game as well, so I was always looking up to Neymar, Ronaldinho, Messi, players like that.\n\nAlex: What did your family make of you playing football?\n\nOlivia: I think my dad really grew me into football and he kind of paved the way for me. He made so many sacrifices for me to be where I am today. I also wanted it and he could see that.\n\nAlex: How would your family and friends describe you?\n\nOlivia: Oh, ambitious, crazy... just attacking-minded. My dad always described me whenever I'd play as I'd just take the ball off my own team-mates to go score a goal!\n\nAlex: What was it like for you to make that transition when you finally moved away from Canada playing football?\n\nOlivia: It was quite tough, although I had been away from home for a bit before that. But going to Portugal, for example, it's a whole new world. Different language, different style of football. So having to learn that really on my own was quite tough. But the support system that I had around me was great, so I was able to adapt, I'd say, quite quickly, which is nice.\n\nAnd then, obviously, coming over to England, then that's a whole other environment, style of play, different kinds of people. And obviously it just takes a little bit [of time] to get comfortable. Once you make friends and you're happy, it makes a world of difference on the pitch and off the pitch.\n\nAlex: What would you say is the biggest thing you've learned about yourself?\n\nOlivia: I would say I always thought I was quite independent, but coming here and my ability to make relationships with people on my team and outside of football as well, it has really helped me to acclimatise to what life is like here.\n\nAlex: So we need to explain your background. The Jamaican food - your dad - Jamaican roots, right? And I learned your mum has Chilean and Peruvian roots. What was dinner like at home?\n\nOlivia: Dinner looks different pretty much every day and especially when my grandparents would come by to cook. That's when you know it's on top. So we'd have jerk chicken and my grandpa would make oxtail and my grandmother would make something called seco.\n\nOlivia: It's like a [Peruvian] meat stew and rice, and it's in a green sauce - it's really nice.\n\nAlex: And your grandads played football?\n\nAlex: So when they come round, were there football matches? Were you watching them?\n\nOlivia: I was always playing with them when we went on vacation to the Dominican - we always found a pitch and then we would play pick-up games with random people. My grandparents would join, I would join, my dad and my sister - it was always fun.\n\nAlex: What's your typical day off looking like?\n\nOlivia: It depends on the day and how I feel, but I do pretty much like to stay at home. I like to watch movies, binge watch, I also play video games as well. So, yeah, games, probably a little bit of shopping because I love to shop.\n\nAlex: Right. So if you're not playing football, you are..?\n\nAlex: If one song could be playing when you score a goal, what would it be?\n\nOlivia: I'm going to go with A Milli [by Lil Wayne] because I have that on my pre-match playlists. I think every game.\n\nAlex: The last thing you wrote in your phone notes was?\n\nOlivia: Oh. A bunch of numbers. I was playing an escape room game, so I needed to write down all these numbers so I could put it into a code.\n\nAlex: Since moving to England, what's one thing that you're just like \"I absolutely love this\"?\n\nOlivia: I fell in love with Yorkshire puddings and a Sunday dinner. It's my favourite thing - I absolutely love them now.\n\nAlex: Not many people love Yorkshire puddings.\n\nOlivia: Well, initially I wasn't sure. I was very hesitant because I had in my mind, like gravy on bread. And when I tried it for the first time I thought - how do you even describe Yorkshire puddings?\n\nAlex: Let's think about when we're looking ahead to the season, what are your goals and ambitions?\n\nOlivia: Ultimately, I want to become a better version of myself as a player. I know there's a lot of things I need to develop on, and being at Arsenal that will definitely help me. And ultimately I want to win things.\n\nAlex: Do you feel that you've settled in and the reasons that made you want to come to the club are starting to open up to you?\n\nOlivia: Yeah, 100%. I think the first couple of months it was a lot to really take in, but the girls have been amazing making me feel comfortable.\n\nAlex: Talk me through that first day when you arrived at Arsenal.\n\nOlivia: I was absolutely terrified, yeah, because every time we played Arsenal it was just a massive game. Obviously you never know what the environment is like from the outside, and I didn't know what to expect. And walking in, it was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be - everyone was just so welcoming.\n\nAlex: Who's the MVP, the person that if they weren't there tomorrow you'd be thinking \"this feels strange\"?\n\nOlivia: Less [Russo] really. She just has that personality and that vibe that you can feel at the training ground. It's just very comfortable and you can speak to her about anything. She's just very sweet.\n\nAlex: Renee [Slegers] has just signed a new three-year contract. In terms of the other managers that you've played for, how is she different?\n\nOlivia: She's just very ambitious and I feel like that goes for all around the club. Her values match [the club] and match the players as well, so I think that's just a really great thing to have, and also stability - knowing that she's going to be here for the next three years. To have a female empower us - I think that's her big thing as well, that she wants the players to feel empowered and use our voices - which every time that I've spoken to her I'm like, yeah, that's impressive.\n\nAlex: Do you know about my history with Renee? I used to be her teacher when she first came over. I was a teacher at the Arsenal Academy at the time so it's kind of full circle to see her go on to manage the team. She knows what being at the club means for everyone.\n\nAlex: Talking of the next thing, when you're looking at you and your career, what is it that you want to tick off? What do you want to achieve?\n\nOlivia: Oh, there's plenty of things I want to achieve. I want to win everything, ultimately. And again, the biggest thing is I just want to keep developing and growing as a person and a player. I think that's really important to me, just continue to develop my character, meeting more people and just learning.\n\nAlex: You said meeting more people. How have the Arsenal fans embraced you?\n\nOlivia: They've been amazing. I attended the [Arsenal Women fan engagement project] Block by Block, external consultation a couple of weeks ago where we discussed how we can make matchdays better.\n\nIt was really fun because I got to interact with the fans more on a personal level rather than them being up in the stands and just clapping - actually having a conversation and seeing what we can do to make the experience better for them, but also for us as players. Whether that's music, fireworks, just making it more fun.\n\nAlex: I bet the fans must have been buzzing. Did they know that you were turning up?\n\nOlivia: I'm actually not sure, but they seemed quite shocked when I pulled up!\n\nWatch: Arsenal v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Saturday, 24 June (12:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

There are also bonus points on offer for every round reached across the three competitions, although more points are given to teams competing in the Champions League than in the other competitions.\n\nIn the qualification rounds, these points are halved.\n\nPoints earned are then divided by how many teams from that country entered European competitions at the start of the season.\n\nIn the 2025-26 season, England have nine teams competing in Europe. That means all points are divided by nine.\n\nScotland started the season with five teams competing in Europe. Although Hibernian and Dundee United failed to progress out of the qualifying rounds, three teams remain - but Scotland's points are still divided by five.\n\nFor this season, England and Spain were given one extra spot each as they were the two best-performing nations across the 2024-25 campaign. That meant entry to the Champions League was given to Newcastle and Athletic Club.\n\nFor the 2024-25 season, Italy and Germany were given the two places, known as European Performances Spots (EPS).

I think I wanted cats here in England because I couldn't have a lion or a tiger.\n\n\"I love animals. I will always be more comfortable in the jungle, the forest or the wild than in a place like Las Vegas with all the lights. This life is not for me.\n\n\"For me, the beauty is not where there are lights, cameras and parties.

    "fullText": "Losing your manager and captain in the same day are two heavy blows that will require time to recover from.\n\nNo sooner had Manchester City struck an initial £20m deal to sign Crystal Palace's captain Marc Guehi was head coach Oliver Glasner confirming he would be leaving Selhurst Park at the end of the season.\n\nNeither development comes as a shock. BBC Sport revealed that City had accelerated their move for Guehi last Monday in light of Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias suffering injuries.\n\nOn Thursday night, following talks between City and Palace, the England defender's move to Etihad Stadium was agreed in principle.\n\nEven if City had failed in their pursuit to sign Guehi this month, the centre-back's contract expires in June and he was leaving regardless.\n\nSimilarly, with Glasner, while his announcement on Friday was unexpected, the fact he has decided to leave Selhurst Park is far from unanticipated.\n\nGlasner said he had communicated his decision to chairman Steve Parish in October, the same month BBC Sport reported that Palace's hopes of keeping him beyond this season were remote at best.\n\nThe pair, according to Glasner, had made a pact to keep the news a secret until they both decided to make their parting public.\n\nThat did not prevent speculation over Glasner, whose decision to leave Palace had become one of the worst kept secrets in English football.\n\nDid the club's decision to sell Guehi to City prove the catalyst behind Glasner's surprising admission in his weekly press conference? Sources have indicated it was a factor.\n\nBut in many ways, the motivation behind Glasner's bombshell media briefing, in which he also admitted the club are open to selling star striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, is neither here nor there for Palace.\n\nThe real narrative for them is preparing for life without their most successful manager and captain in history.",

His answers tell you a lot about the kind of players he wants to be.\n\n“Number three, Thiago Silva. I used to watch him back in school on Youtube and get in trouble. For me he just has everything. He can head, he can play, when he was in his prime he was quick, he was strong, a leader. I’ve always loved Thiago.”\n\n“Number two I’d go for Sergio Ramos, just a winner. A leader. Always wants to put his body on the line. I used to watch a lot of El Clasico and he would stand out,” the defender continued.\n\n“Number one? John Terry, legend of the club. What he did in the Premier League, what he did for the club. He helped me out a lot when I was younger and I would train with the first team. He would be the one to put his arm around the young players, to help them gain a bit of confidence, you know.”\n\nA very good set of answers there. It never ceases to amaze us how many nice things you’ll find everyone saying about JT who has worked at Chelsea.\n\nYou can see Chalobah speaking in the clip embedded here:\n\nWhile Chelsea delay, their sister club is getting into gear. Strasbourg have already agreed a €7m deal for a talented attacking midfielder who will apparently take his medical today.\n\nChelsea are suddenly seemingly interested in January transfer moves, and Matt Law of the Daily Telegraph has a big update on a potential sale the Blues could made.",

Everyone will know me one day.\"\n\nHis mother may have thought he did not really know what he was talking about. But he knew.\n\nHowever, his path to success has not been straightforward.\n\nHe had to wait until he was 17 to sign for a club, having faced several rejections at trials around Brazil.\n\n\"Thiago would call me late at night in tears to say that football wasn't for him,\" Sergio Goncalves, his mentor from his early years at Gremio Ocidental, a local community football initiative, tells BBC Sport. \"But he was born to score goals.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old has found the back of the net 16 times in the Premier League this season.\n\nHe is on target to reach the 20-goal mark once again in his career - having done so in three of his four seasons in Europe, the only exception being his debut campaign with Brentford, which was disrupted by a serious injury.\n\nThiago's next stop is Saturday's west London derby against Chelsea.",

They turned to Solskjaer after sacking Jose Mourinho in December 2018, later offering the Norwegian the full-time position after he lost only once in 13 league games in charge.\n\nThe club also hired Ralf Rangnick to lead the team for six months after Solskjaer's dismissal and Carrick's brief stint, but the Austrian struggled to implement his gameplan and battled with the hierarchy over recruitment - winning 11 games, drawing 10 and losing eight as the Red Devils finished sixth in the Premier League and without a trophy.\n\nUnited will be hoping Carrick can succeed in the same manner as Guus Hiddink, who delivered the FA Cup at Chelsea in 2009 as an interim, and Roberto di Matteo, who led the Blues to FA Cup and Champions League glory in 2012.\n\nBut what does an interim coach do? How is the job different to a full-time position? And is hiring an interim manager a good idea?",

She says Greenland is not a big deal (a “second-order issue” is how she described it to the BBC) – it is a big deal. She says net zero is too expensive – the opposite is true: net-anything-but-zero is a cost we can’t afford.\n\nBut her promise to ban under-16s from using social media, echoing Australia’s recent move, is hard to write off completely; people across the spectrum, including Andy Burnham, agree with it. Nobody who has ever met a teenager, or read the news, will be completely at ease with the role of social media in young lives. There are horrific effects, which have been well documented and inadequately addressed ever since the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing suicide and self-harm content online.\n\nMany platforms, even those that seem anodyne, are purpose-built to spur anxiety, self-doubt, self-harm, anything that delivers attention. We have this completely contradictory environment in which a nine-year-old can’t walk to school alone without turning into grist for a radio phone-in about parental neglect, and yet tech companies with a record of generating emotional distress for profit are allowed access to children’s bedrooms. Grok can generate sexualised images of children on demand, and the UK government calls it a matter for Ofcom.\n\nThe asymmetry of acceptable risk between the real world and the virtual, even while we can see that online harms show up soon enough in lived experience, is inexplicable. It must be more baffling still if you happen to be under 16, working on the assumption that the adults telling you what to do must know what they’re talking about.\n\nEven at the milder end, a lot of social media apps seem designed to mess with a young mind. Take the problems created by location services, whereby kids are able to see one another’s whereabouts 24/7, so discovering in real time what they haven’t been invited to and what their ex-best friend is up to; or the intolerable body-image pressure of a life lived in selfies; or the stress of the streak (a chain of back-and-forth messages or pictures), friendships torched by a slow reply.\n\nIn short, not everything is wrong with Badenoch’s idea; only two things. First, if there’s one thing more ridiculous than taking a corporate failure and throwing it to the individual to solve, by self-discipline reinforced by legislation, it is doing so to under-16s. If a corporation is selling radical misogyny and methods for self-harm – because what else are they going to do, disappoint shareholders? – that is not for a 12-year-old to fix by turning off their phone and taking up crochet. It’s not for a parent to fix, either, by instituting a load of screen limits and parental blocks; even if you enjoy that side of things, it shouldn’t be up to you to fill late-capitalism’s moral void. You could make the case for government intervention, but only if it had time on its hands after tackling the problem at source.\n\nSecond, while young people are unarguably the target of so much manipulative content, to discuss online risks without mentioning older people is frankly perverse. An X user recently asked Grok to identify misinformation super-spreaders on the site from the UK, and probably the youngest among them were Tommy Robinson, 43, and Darren Grimes, 32.. This was data crunched from Amnesty, Global Witness and the BBC, among others, and helpfully built a list of accounts most likely to promulgate untruth or conspiracy, with the caveat it was “subjective and depends on sources”: Nigel Farage, Laurence Fox, Julia Hartley-Brewer, George Galloway, Katie Hopkins, David Icke. None are of a tender age. Between Gen X miscreants and hyper-credulous boomers, there are generations that pose a greater risk to, and are themselves at risk from, the informational ecosystem. Any thinking politician needs to work out how to deal with them.",

As a manager, I understood why - even though I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when it was considered very special by everyone - and this year will be no different.\n\nAfter a busy festive period and another round of games in midweek this week, the games this weekend will be looked on by the Premier League teams as a chance to rest some of their players, and in some cases all of them!\n\nIt's sad to see, even if it could lead to opportunities for smaller clubs to join the band of giantkillers which the competition has become famous for down the years.\n\nI have experienced both sides of the coin. When we were promoted to the Premier League in 2008, Stoke initially struggled and at the turn of the year, when we came to a third-round tie at League One side Hartlepool, I changed practically the whole team.",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on DJ and producer Shadow Child - and AI - with his predictions for all 32 FA Cup third-round ties.",
    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has made his predictions for all 32 FA Cup third-round ties.\n\nHe is up against DJ and producer Shadow Child, aka Simon Neale, and AI.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\n\nShadow Child is a Portsmouth fan who has fond memories of the FA Cup that go back much further than when Pompey won it in 2008.\n\n\"That was huge, and so was when we lost narrowly in the final two years later,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But my favourite FA Cup memory was actually 1992, when we had a run to the semi-finals and lost to eventual winners Liverpool in a replay.\n\n\"I was 15, stood on the Clock End at Highbury for the first of those games, and that is when I fully understood the emotion that goes with football.\n\n\"I'd been going to Fratton Park since I was five, but that was the moment for me. That's the power of the FA Cup, and a run like that can resonate with you for your whole life.\n\n\"The year we won it, all five games from round three to the final were 1-0 wins. You take them all, obviously, but most of those ties were not that glamorous.\n\n\"The really memorable game that year was our 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Rio Ferdinand ended up in goal when we scored our winner from the penalty spot, which sounds crazy talking about it now. Again, I will never forget it.\"\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\n5th in League Two v 23rd in Championship\n\nOxford must be short of confidence going into this one. They are in a relegation battle, have lost four of their past five games and are still without a manager after sacking Gary Rowett before Christmas.\n\nCraig Short is in interim charge and, like all teams fighting the drop, I'm sure Championship survival is his priority over the FA Cup.\n\nMK Dons boss Paul Warne is an old team-mate of mine from my village team, Horsford Under-12s, and he learnt a lot from playing alongside me.\n\nThey are going well under him in the league and I have got faith in Paul to deliver an FA Cup shock.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, MK Dons to win on penalties\n\nSimon's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n24th in League One v 13th in League Two\n\nPort Vale are struggling and they are another team who have just changed their manager. This will be Jon Brady's first game in charge, after they sacked Darren Moore at the end of December.\n\nVale got a big win over Blackpool on New Year's Day but they have still got the worst home record in League One, with only two wins there all season.\n\nFleetwood knocked out another League One side, Luton, on penalties in round two which was a great result - so the Cod Army won't be afraid of Vale, either.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Port Vale win on penalties\n\n4th in Championship v 15th in League One\n\nPaul Heckingbottom is doing a fine job at Preston but, with them chasing promotion, he is probably weighing up whether he wants another FA Cup run after his side reached the quarter-finals last year.\n\nWigan have come through two penalty shootouts to reach round three. Their boss Ryan Lowe will be desperate to get one over his former club but, even if Preston make changes, I still think they will edge this.\n\n9th in Championship v 17th in Premier League\n\nMoney-bags Wrexham have picked up a bit of form in the Championship, with one of my colleagues from the Monday Night Club, Conor Coady, their rock at the back.\n\nNottingham Forest got a huge win at West Ham on Tuesday and Sean Dyche will want to carry that momentum on here.\n\nI suspect this will be tight, because Wrexham are unbeaten in 10 games at home, but Forest should have a little bit too much quality.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\n\nEV Charger Points Stadium, 12:15 GMT\n\n18th in League Two v 12th in Championship\n\nI know Cheltenham aren't having a great time of it because one of their fans is a regular caller on 606.\n\nLeicester are having a poor season too, though, and their supporters were expecting a lot more from them following their relegation from the Premier League.\n\nThis is a must-win game for Foxes boss Marti Cifuentes, who is coming under a bit of pressure because his side are toiling in mid-table.\n\nCheltenham will be really up for this, but I think Cifuentes will get the result he needs.\n\n12th in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI'd like to think these teams will have a real go at the FA Cup this season, because neither of them have got relegation to worry about, but they both come into this tie off the back of poor results.\n\nThe Black Cats' defeat at Brentford was a very un-Sunderland like performance compared to what we've seen from them this season, while Everton will be very disappointed to have only drawn at home to Wolves.\n\nThe last time Sunderland reached the final, when they lost to Liverpool in 1992, they broke my heart on the way when they beat my Norwich side in the semi-final. I missed a great chance in that game too, when I ballooned a shot over the bar.\n\nIt still haunts me how we didn't make it to Wembley that year - we deserved to. Sunderland are due another FA Cup run because they have only made it to round four once in the past 10 years, but I don't think this is their year either.\n\nI can see this going to penalties, and Jordan Pickford will win it for the Toffees.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Everton win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I don't see this being a great game, more a battle of attrition. 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n14th in National League North v 13th in Premier League\n\nWhat a tie this is. My 606 co-host Robbie Savage built the foundations for this Macclesfield side and they have gone on an amazing run under John Rooney to get this far.\n\nIt started with a win over Atherton Laburnum Rovers in the second qualifying round in September.\n\nOne of their scorers that day was Ethan McLeod, who died in a car accident before Christmas on his way back from a game, which puts everything in perspective.\n\nThis would be the biggest shock in FA Cup history if Macclesfield won, because no sixth-tier side has ever beaten one from the top flight since the FA Cup started in 1871, but I don't think that will happen.\n\nPalace have not been in good form recently but they played well in their draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday when they defended strongly.\n\nThe holders are solid even when they don't fire up front, and they should win this pretty comfortably.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I'd love this to be different because we all love a giant-killing, but I can't see it. 0-4\n\n20th in Premier League v 22nd in League Two\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards is starting to get a tune out of his players and Mateus Mane is really shining for them.\n\nDoes Edwards change things up here, or does he look to build more momentum?\n\nThis is a local derby but he has played for both clubs so he will get what the tie is all about, and Shrewsbury don't really look like they are in the kind of shape to spring a surprise at Molineux, either.\n\nThey have not won any of their past eight league games and staying in the Football League will be the main thing on their manager Michael Appleton's mind.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n2nd in National League v 21st in League One\n\nBoreham Wood are flying and Robbie Savage always tells me how strong they are - he really rates them.\n\nThey reached the fifth round in 2022 under Luke Garrard, when they lost at Everton, and I think their run will continue this year too.\n\nI know Garrard's focus might be on promotion to the Football League, because getting out of the National League is brutal, but his side are up against a Burton team who are bang out of form at the bottom of League One.\n\nWood will have to stop the top scorer in the FA Cup this season, Tyrese Shade, who has scored five goals in two games for Burton so far - but I am backing them to put Shade in the shade.\n\n19th in Premier League v 5th in Championship\n\nI have a feeling this will be quite close. Millwall are really well organised under Alex Neil and I am not surprised they are doing well this season.\n\nBurnley have started picking up a few draws, but they still haven't won since the end of October.\n\nThis could be the day that changes, although Scott Parker's side will have to work hard to finish Millwall off.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Burnley win on penalties\n\n23rd in League One v 15th in Championship\n\nSouthampton have dropped off after making a good start under Tonda Eckert. He won his first four games after replacing Will Still at the start of November, but has not won any of his past six matches.\n\nDoncaster are on a similar run in League One, taking one point from a possible 18, and with both teams in such poor form, it might take penalties to separate them.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Southampton to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: Putting our south-coast differences aside, Southampton will probably win... but come on Doncaster! 2-0\n\n9th in Premier League v 2nd in Championship\n\nIt will be interesting to see what Fulham boss Marco Silva does here, with his team on such a good run of Premier League results. I hope he goes strong, to try to keep their momentum going.\n\nSilva has good record in the FA Cup anyhow, reaching the quarter-final twice in the past three years. He has also never lost a third-round tie with any of the four English clubs he has managed, and I don't see that changing this weekend.\n\nMiddlesbrough got back on track with a big win over Southampton on Sunday but they hit a sticky patch over Christmas when their goals dried up and it is pretty obvious that their promotion bid will be the priority for their manager Kim Hellberg.\n\n3rd in Championship v 18th in League One\n\nIpswich have started to hit their stride in the Championship and have only lost one of their past eight games.\n\nLike Hellberg at Boro, I suspect Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna will make full use of his squad here but they should still have too much for a Blackpool side who are struggling in League One.\n\nIt is nice to be able to predict an Ipswich result again, and it would be good if their fans had something to cheer about after they had such a miserable time in the Premier League last season.\n\nMcKenna is such a good manager, I think they will get one of the automatic promotion spots, sadly. They won't win the FA Cup though!\n\n2nd in Premier League v 14th in League One\n\nManchester City have reached the final in the past two seasons and they are my pick to win the FA Cup this year. Pep Guardiola always takes the competition seriously and that won't change whatever happens in the title race.\n\nGuardiola's side have paid the price for not putting games to bed in the past few days and those dropped points are making things easier for Arsenal at the top of the table.\n\nI don't see Manchester City having any problems here, though, even if they field a second-string side.\n\nExeter City boss Gary Caldwell lifted the FA Cup in 2013 when he was part of the Wigan team that upset Manchester City in the final. What a great memory that must be for him, but his side are going out on Saturday.\n\n6th in Premier League v 15th in Premier League\n\nI just wonder how much Wednesday night's epic game against Leeds will have taken out of Newcastle, who have got the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final with Manchester City coming up next week too.\n\nThere was also plenty of late drama in Bournemouth's win over Tottenham, but my concern with the Cherries is more about the effect of Antoine Semenyo's departure, because it appears he has played his last game for them.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe does not have a great record against his old club in the Premier League, where he has not got the better of them in seven attempts, but he did beat them in the Carabao Cup in 2022.\n\nI was tempted to go for a Bournemouth win here, but I am not sure how many changes Andoni Iraola will make either.\n\nThe one thing I am sure of is that there will be a few goals flying in, because of the way both teams play. Let's go for another thriller, with a shootout to settle it.\n\nSutton's prediction: 3-3 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\n4th in League Two v 2nd in League Two\n\nThese teams meet each other again in the league next week, and I suspect the points will matter more to Swindon boss Ian Holloway and Salford manager Karl Robinson than this tie.\n\nSalford beat Swindon 3-2 here in September but Holloway's side have the best away record in the division and I'm going with them to nick it in extra time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Salford win on penalties\n\n24th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nIt is really sad to see what has happened at Sheffield Wednesday and there is no way for them to salvage their season now.\n\nBrentford are flying at the moment under Keith Andrews and they are another club who I'd love to see have a real go at the FA Cup this season.\n\nThe Bees have never got past the quarter-finals in their history, and have not even got that far since 1989. You only have to look at Palace last year to find a team winning it for the first time so it is definitely doable for them too.\n\n8th in Championship v 1st in Championship\n\nCoventry are having a little wobble. They are still top of the Championship, but Sunday's defeat at Birmingham means they have only one win in their past five matches.\n\nThat just makes me think Sky Blues boss Frank Lampard will rest players here, and it is a real opportunity for my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins against his former club.\n\nRobins had that great run to the semi-finals with Coventry a couple of years back, and you can imagine he will be absolutely determined that Stoke get through this tie.\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Stoke win on penalties\n\n10th in Championship v 6th in Championship\n\nWatford have really hit form and come into this on the back of four wins in a row.\n\nBristol City, in contrast, have been patchy but again I think both sides will make changes.\n\nIt finished 1-1 at Ashton Gate in November, and I'm going for the same scoreline again, with City winning on penalties.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Bristol City to win on penalties\n\n6th in League Two v 14th in Championship\n\nCambridge are on a heck of a run, and have gone 14 games unbeaten in all competitions since the end of October.\n\nBirmingham, meanwhile, have been a bit flaky. Blues boss Chris Davies needed Sunday's win over Coventry because his side have not really got going this season.\n\nOn paper, this has the makings of a shock because Birmingham have not won many on the road, but I actually fancy my old club to go on a bit of a cup run this year, and they will start by giving Cambridge an education.\n\n12th in League Two v 2nd in National League South\n\nI was at Blundell Park when Grimsby knocked Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup in August, and what a night that was.\n\nNow the Mariners are trying to avoid being on the wrong end of a huge upset themselves but, again, home advantage will help.\n\nWeston-super-Mare are in the third round for the first time in their 138-year history, which is an amazing achievement, but their cup run ends here.\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 17:45\n\n14th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\n\nPoor old Thomas Frank. He looked so happy at Brentford but Spurs have a habit of turning happy managers into total miseries.\n\nHe really needs a win here, and a good run in the cup too, but when you compare the two teams, and the way they are playing, then there's only one winner here - and that's Villa.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: This is the kind of game Tottenham need, because there is less pressure on them. Villa are going more for the top four and Spurs could take this. 3-2\n\n19th in Championship v 8th in Premier League\n\nIt doesn't feel as if Liam Rosenior's appointment has been particularly welcomed by some Chelsea fans.\n\nThis is his first game in charge and he could really do with making a fast start to help win some of the doubters over.\n\nThere are tougher tests to come - like Arsenal in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final next week - but I think he will get the result he wants here.\n\nThere will be a packed house at The Valley, with Charlton's biggest crowd for an FA Cup tie in 50 years, but the Addicks are not in great form and Chelsea's quality should see them through.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: It's been a turbulent week for Chelsea too, and again we will see a response. I always try to visualise things when I think about them, and when I pictured The Valley, I just saw Chelsea scoring! 1-3\n\n13th in Championship v 16th in Premier League\n\nLeeds have been terrific recently and, as regular readers will know, I am really pleased for their manager Daniel Farke and how he has changed the narrative about his future.\n\nI can see Farke making plenty of changes here because, while he would love a cup run, he knows there is still work to do to keep his side in the Premier League.\n\nThat's why I am going for Derby to cause an upset. They are improving all the time under John Eustace and while Leeds will be full of confidence off the back of the past few weeks, I am not sure they will maintain their intensity with a second-string side.\n\n21st in Championship v 1st in Premier League\n\nArsenal will definitely make changes here, but it won't make any difference.\n\nPortsmouth are in trouble at the bottom of the Championship and they look short of what is required there, let alone against the Premier League leaders - or even their reserves.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I very reluctantly have to be realistic here - I hate to say it, but I would be really shocked if Arsenal didn't win. If we took them to penalties that would be incredible, but I don't think we will. It depends what team they put out, but whoever plays, it is going to be difficult for us.\n\nI can't make it to the game but I will be glued to the TV, and my dad will be there - he has been a season ticket holder at Fratton Park since 1967. 0-1\n\n7th in Championship v 20th in Championship\n\nHull are having a great season, while Blackburn are in serious danger of being relegated.\n\nIt is no surprise that Rovers are struggling because they just don't have the quality in their side.\n\nIt turns my stomach to see the state of my old club now compared to the way it was when I was there in the 1990s, because it is a shadow of its former self.\n\nSurvival is all Blackburn fans can hope for, while Hull supporters must be dreaming of a return to the Premier League. They are going to win this tie, too.\n\n22nd in Championship v 3rd in League Two\n\nNorwich are another of my old clubs who are fighting relegation, although at least Philippe Clement has picked up a few wins since he took charge in November.\n\nThe Canaries have lost their past couple of home games, to Watford and Stoke, but Clement has done really well to give them a chance of staying up. Now they need to spend in January, because he needs a bit of help.\n\nI am not sure Clement wants or needs an FA Cup run now but Norwich fans could do with a bit of cheer at Carrow Road.\n\nI am backing Norwich to win but I need to apologise to Walsall boss Mat Sadler anyhow. They were flying last season, but then he came on the Monday Night Club in January and he was one of the managers we cursed.\n\nWhoever came on, their results fell through the floor afterwards, so we were to blame for Walsall's slide down the table.\n\n16th in Championship v 11th in League One\n\nTwo wily old managers go head to head here.\n\nBetween them, Sheffield United's Chris Wilder and Mansfield's Nigel Clough have spent more than 50 years in the dug-out, and I have got a lot of respect for both of them.\n\nWilder has turned things around for the Blades after their dreadful start to the campaign and, while Clough has won his last three games with the Stags, I am going for Sheffield United to continue their improvement.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n17th in Championship v 18th in Championship\n\nWest Brom have just sacked their manager Ryan Mason, so James Morrison is in charge for this one.\n\nThe Baggies could really do with a win but their form on the road is awful - they have lost 10 away games in a row.\n\nSwansea changed their manager recently too, with Vitor Matos replacing Alan Sheehan in November, and their season has been just as disappointing.\n\nWhile West Brom won 3-2 when these teams met at The Hawthorns in November, Swansea pinched a 1-0 win at Liberty Stadium on New Year's Day.\n\nI'm going for another close game this time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Swansea to win on penalties\n\n18th in Premier League v 11th in Championship\n\nThis is a must-win for West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo and, let's face it, they might sack him anyway even if he gets past QPR.\n\nI don't think home advantage helps the Hammers, who suffered a catastrophic defeat against Forest at the London Stadium on Tuesday. I'm not sure how many of their fans will turn up for this game, and the ones who do are not going to be in a good mood either.\n\nBut while West Ham have been very poor recently, they still have some good players and they should surely still see off a mid-table Championship team on their own patch.\n\nQPR have been knocked out in the third round of the FA Cup more times - 52 - than any other side since the current format of the competition started 100 years ago.\n\nI am going for them to suffer defeat number 53, and for Nuno to survive a little bit longer.\n\n7th in Premier League v 11th in Premier League\n\nBrighton have been quite erratic this season, and I have done really badly at predicting their results, but they have proved time and time again how dangerous they are.\n\nIt's a boost for United that Bruno Fernandes is fit again, but their draw with Burnley on Thursday was still a poor result.\n\nI know United fans love it when their side proves me wrong after I predict they will lose, but I can't see them doing that on Sunday.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: United have had an interesting week. I've gone for them to win because I am expecting a huge reaction from them and their fans at Old Trafford, but Danny Welbeck will nick one for Brighton. 3-1\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, United win on penalties\n\n4th in Premier League v 17th in League One\n\nBristol City fans will come to Anfield hoping for a repeat of their famous win here in the FA Cup in 2008, but I don't see another shock on the cards.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot will have learnt his lesson about the cup after last season, when his side crashed out to Plymouth after he made 10 changes.\n\nSlot needs an FA Cup run this season, so I am sure he will not risk another upset here. If Liverpool were to lose this, he would be under serious pressure.\n\nI am just not convinced by the way his side are playing at the moment, and I don't think many Liverpool fans are either.\n\nEven so, they are at home to a League One side, and this should be a pretty routine victory.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The BBC have detailed how it’s a gloomy task for new Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior to reach the minimum aim this season.\n\nThe Blues slipped to 8th in the Premier League table last night after losing 2-1 away from home against Fulham.\n\nMarc Cucurella got himself sent off early in the game with what was a stupid moment from the full back in a moment of madness.\n\nChelsea players then lost their heads in the aftermath complaining about a decision that was a stone wall one in my opinion, with three of their players getting booked for dissent right after.\n\nStriker Liam Delap did manage to get a goal back for Chelsea and everyone started believing that their ten men might actually get something out of the game.\n\nBut any hope was soon crushed there when Fulham pressed on again and found that all important second and winning goal. Chelsea down to 8th in the league.\n\nBehdad Eghbali in the stands at Fulham.\n\nNizaar Kinsella of The BBC writes:\n\n“Chelsea have won just one of their past nine league games and two of 11 in all competitions, falling from potential title contenders in November to a side now lagging far behind.\n\n“They have ground to make up to achieve their minimum aim this season – qualifying for the Champions League, which should be achievable with a top-five finish.”\n\nI think if anything, this is playing it all down a bit. That is a very gloomy looking task for Rosenior, and he only has half a season to do it. Yikes.\n\nChelsea are only five points ahead of 15th place in the Premier League table right now and 17 points off first placed Arsenal.",

    "fullText": "BBC Sport readers have picked their team of the series for the Ashes.\n\nWe asked you to pick an 11 that included two openers, four middle-order batters or all-rounders, a wicketkeeper and four bowlers.\n\nHere's who made the cut and their series stats.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 629, average: 62.90, centuries: three\n\nNo doubts about this man's selection. Travis Head stepped up to open in the first Test and has dominated from the top of the order. He blazed 123 in Perth, sealed the series victory with 170 in Adelaide and then added 163 in Sydney for good measure.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 273, average: 27.30, centuries: none\n\nBar Head, the other openers in the series have enjoyed modest returns. Zak Crawley was dismissed for a pair in Perth, but made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 286, average: 57.20, centuries: one\n\nSo frequently a feature of English nightmares, Steve Smith had a relatively quiet series initially, passing fifty once and missing the Adelaide Test with sickness. However, his 138 in Sydney took the game away from England and saw him become the second-highest Ashes run-scorer behind Don Bradman.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 400, average: 44.44, centuries: two\n\nFeast and famine for England's legendary batter. Joe Root finally got to three figures in Australia, making an unbeaten 138 in Brisbane and 160 in Sydney, but only passed 20 on one other occasion in the series.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 438, average: 39.77, centuries: none\n\nA case of what could have been for Harry Brook. The big-hitting batter passed 40 on five occasions in the series, but his highest score was his 84 in Sydney.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 184, average: 18.40, wickets: 15, average: 25.13\n\nA better series with the ball than with the bat for England's skipper. Ben Stokes was frequently England's most threatening bowler, with his best showing a 5-23 in Perth. He made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide but his next highest score was 19, and he was dismissed for single figures on six occasions.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 323, average: 46.14, dismissals: 28\n\nThe default pick for the wicketkeeper position. Alex Carey prospered both behind the stumps and with the bat. After 63 in Brisbane, he had a dream Test at his home ground of Adelaide, hitting 106 and 72 as Australia clinched the series.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 31, average: 19.93, strike-rate: 29.6; runs: 156\n\nA remarkable series for the left-armer. Mitchell Starc started the series with a bang, taking 10 wickets in Perth as Australia blew England away inside two days. He added 6-75 in the first innings at Brisbane while also contributing crucial half-centuries in both the second and third Tests.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: nine, average: 27.11, strike-rate: 53.33, runs: 102\n\nEngland wanted express pace in Australia and Jofra Archer delivered. While his figures didn't necessarily reflect his contribution in the first two Tests, he took 5-53 in the first innings in Adelaide and added a half-century later in the Test. A side strain saw him withdraw from the series after that match.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 20, average: 24.95, strike-rate: 47.9\n\nScott Boland's nagging accuracy tormented England throughout the series. Thanks to the absence of Josh Hazlewood, the veteran seamer delivered in spades. He even got to open the batting in the quick-paced Test at Melbourne.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: 18, average: 20.11, strike-rate: 32.4\n\nWhat if he'd played earlier? Josh Tongue was introduced in the third Test in Adelaide and set about adding to his already impressive haul of international wickets. He took 4-70 in the second innings in South Australia and picked up 5-45 as England bowled out Australia for 152 on day one in Melbourne.\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - Ashes player ratings",

    "description": "BBC Sport profiles twin brothers Tyler and Jack Fletcher, who will hope to get minutes at Manchester United under interim head coach and father Darren",
    "fullText": "Manchester United interim manager Darren Fletcher's twin sons are both currently midfielders at the club.\n\nThe 19-year-old academy duo featured as part of Ruben Amorim's final few matches in charge of United prior to his dismissal as head coach on Monday.\n\nFormer United midfielder and under-18s head coach Darren was promoted to interim head coach in Amorim's place and will take charge of United's trip to Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Tyler has made the bench in each of United's last three games, Jack was used by Amorim in United's last three matches of 2025 as a substitute.\n\nThe brothers are central midfielders. While both can play more defensively, Jack has also played as a winger on the right side.\n\nThe duo are capped internationally. Although they both started with England's under-16s, Tyler switched nationalities to Scotland - the nation his father represented.\n\nTyler and Jack played against each other in November 2025 during a Under-19s European Championship qualifier between Scotland and England.\n\nIn July 2023, the pair signed for United from direct rivals Manchester City for a reported combined fee of £1.25m.\n\nAlthough there was an element of surprise when Jack Fletcher was named in Ruben Amorim's squad for the trip to Tottenham in November, after Kobbie Mainoo pulled out due to injury, in terms of available midfielders he was next in line.\n\nBoth Jack and Tyler have been central figures in Travis Binnion's Under-21 squad this season. While results against senior teams in both the EFL Trophy and National League Cup have not been exceptional this season, United's Under-21 side go into the second half of the Premier League 2 campaign with an excellent record of seven wins and a single defeat from their eight games. The Fletcher brothers are part of that.\n\nJack is viewed as slightly more progressive in his passing, and tends to play higher up the pitch. He has also featured at full-back at times, which may be an advantage when it comes to making matchday squads at senior level.\n\nBoth were part of Manchester City's academy at one stage, and while Darren Fletcher is evidently a guiding light in their careers, he has been keen to let the pair make their own decisions in terms of their playing journey - including which international team they wanted to represent.\n\nTyler is also good on the ball, but is yet to score this season, which Jack has. However, he is also still to be sent off, which is what happened to Jack in the EFL Trophy at Barnsley, when he objected to a refereeing decision in a manner the referee found unacceptable.\n\nShould either of the Fletcher twins play under father Darren while he is in interim charge of United, they would join an exclusive club of sons to have played under the management of their fathers in the Premier League.\n\nJamie Redknapp played under dad Harry at Southampton, while former United centre-back Steve Bruce managed son Alex at Hull.\n\nAlso at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson handed 18 Premier League appearances to son Darren during the first half of the 1992-93 season.\n\nIn that same season, Nigel Clough played every match under father Brian at Nottingham Forest.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy is the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia?\n\nThe cricketer's son recalled by Guardiola - who is Max Alleyne?\n\nIs the new manager bounce real or a myth?\n\nHow does Amorim's record compare to other Man Utd managers?",

    "fullText": "On days like this, when a manager falls, the immediate reaction is to think about where it all went wrong, the timeline of doom, the moments where the writing started appearing on the wall.\n\nWith Wilfried Nancy, there's no need for any of that because it was never right in the first place. There were no turning points in this saga, no twists in the plot.\n\nNancy's appointment was one of the greatest blunders Celtic have made in their history. A relative rookie on a bad run with Columbus Crew - they finished seventh in Major League Soccer - it was a punt based on little more than the hipster vibes of Paul Tisdale, the now former head of football operations.\n\nTisdale didn't open his mouth to fans or media in his brief time in a powerful position at Celtic Park, but he did a whole lot of damage. If Nancy ranks extremely highly in the club's most calamitous calls then Tisdale is on a par or, perhaps even, slightly ahead of him given that it was the self-styled 'Doctor Football' who championed Nancy to the club's board.\n\nNancy never got out of the blocks, his two wins from eight games coming in a flawed victory over bottom-of-the-table Livingston and a triumph over 10-man Aberdeen, who have also just sacked their manager.\n\nAll memory of Nancy's reign - if you want to call it that - will be shovelled under a carpet now by anybody and everybody culpable in the process of appointing him. If they're all true to recent form, none of them will speak, none will apologise, none will show humility by accepting that they got this woefully wrong.\n\nThe fans will have to make-do with a short written statement. Let them eat cake, in other words.\n\nNancy's laidback arrival - spending just 15 minutes talking with Martin O'Neill before ripping up everything O'Neill had done to stabilise things - was in stark contrast to the unceremonious manner of his exit. O'Neill, as interim, was there longer than Nancy.",

There becomes a slight desperation when you're looking to bring players in.\n\n\"But they definitely need some players just to have fresh faces in the dressing room because they need a bit of change at the moment.\n\n\"I do [think Nuno is the one to get them out of trouble]. He knows the league, he's been in the league a long time, getting Wolves promoted a long time ago and he did so well at Nottingham Forest last year too.\n\n\"[But] nine games without a win and they need to turn that around quickly.

    "description": "As Leeds aim to beat Manchester United in the Premier League for the first time since 2002, BBC Sport looks at their intense rivalry before Sunday's Elland Road meeting.",
    "fullText": "In his best-selling 'Managing My Life' autobiography, Sir Alex Ferguson reflected on his feelings about a trip to Elland Road.\n\n\"The crowd invariably give us the impression that a lynching would be too good for us,\" he said.\n\nAfter a typically fraught League Cup victory there in 2011, Ferguson offered this observation too.\n\n\"I have always said Liverpool-Manchester United games are fierce in many aspects,\" he added.\n\n\"But it never reaches the levels of Leeds United. Never.\"\n\nLeeds have already hosted a couple of historic rivals in December, beating Chelsea 3-1 at home and producing an epic fightback to snatch a point in a 3-3 draw against Liverpool.\n\nBut a visit from Manchester United is something else.\n\n\"I have a decorating firm and for 40 years we have had the motto that we will not use red paint,\" said lifelong Leeds fan Gary Edwards.\n\n\"We will paint over red free of charge. It's still going to this day. It's on all the business cards and letterheads.\"\n\nThe actual origins of the rivalry are difficult to pinpoint.\n\nMany feel it dates to the War of the Roses in the 15th century, although that is probably too simplistic given the Duchy and Dukedom of the Houses of York and Lancaster had little to do with the cities themselves and the Duchy of Lancaster had land and offices in Yorkshire.\n\nOthers think the rivalry has its origins in the industrial revolution which does, at least in part, correspond to the emergence of football as an organised sport - even if neither club, either originally as Leeds City and Newton Heath, or their current names, came to real prominence until after the Second World War.\n\nPossibly, the reverence from the 1950s and beyond for the Busby Babes compared to the negativity around Don Revie's team in the 1960s and 70s, is a factor.\n\nThe knowledge that key players - Johnny Giles, Gordon Strachan, Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Denis Irwin and Eric Cantona among them - left one club to become an integral part of the success of the other is another. Also, the proximity of the best supported teams from the two biggest cities in two neighbouring counties, separated geographically, by the Pennines.\n\nWhatever it is, the rivalry is real and despite the early 12:30 GMT kick-off, Elland Road is guaranteed to be a cauldron as Leeds look for their first home victory over Manchester United in the Premier League since 2002, when Harry Kewell scored the winner.\n\nFormer England goalkeeper Paul Robinson was in goal for Leeds that day and told BBC Sport: \"One hundred percent it feels different.\n\n\"You get to the stadium two hours before kick-off and certain areas are sectioned off. There are police here, you can't drive there. This road is closed, that road is closed.\n\n\"It is as intense as any derby that you want to name in this country - and it is not friendly.\n\n\"I grew up as a kid in the Leeds academy and was a ball boy at some games. The away section used to be in the cheese wedge in the corner of Elland Road. For most of the season, nobody wanted to be a ball boy in that corner. But when Manchester United came to town, everybody wanted to be over in that corner, for whatever reason.\n\n\"It was just a different game and a different experience.\"\n\nNeither manager has been part of a Leeds-Manchester United game before.\n\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke knows it is a game that means a lot for his club's fans and is talking about making \"dreams come true\".\n\nManchester United's Portuguese head coach Ruben Amorim has been at the centre of the Dérbi de Lisboa, as a player for Benfica and a coach at Lisbon rivals Sporting.\n\nHe is not sure the comparison is particularly helpful.\n\n\"I heard it is a big rivalry and a big derby,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"It is hard to compare different cultures, different derbies and different histories. It's a game in a hostile environment and that is going to be hard for any player. But when you play for Manchester United, you need to be ready for everything.\"\n\nLeeds' last title-winning campaign in 1992 was made more satisfying because they won it at the expense of Manchester United, who were in control of their own destiny until a run of three successive defeats in the space of seven days right at the end of the season let Howard Wilkinson's side in.\n\nSadly for Leeds, the post-script came the following November, when chief executive Bill Fotherby rang Manchester United counterpart Martin Edwards to ask about the chances of bringing full-back Irwin back to the club.\n\nFerguson was in the room and said no to Irwin leaving, but told Edwards to mention the availability of French forward Cantona. It was a call that changed the course of English footballing history.\n\n\"I've never forgiven Bill for that,\" says Gary Edwards.\n\nMaybe one of the reasons why Leeds' rivalry with Manchester United doesn't spring to mind in the same way as others in England is the relative infrequency of it happening.\n\nApart from the 14-year spell that began with Leeds' top-flight promotion in 1990 and relegation in 2004, the two clubs met only eight times in the other 30 years from 1982. Leeds won once in 2010, as a League One side at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, and lost on five occasions.\n\nThe two clubs' fans don't forget though.\n\n\"Even when Leeds were in League One and the Championship, Manchester United still sang a song about teams they didn't like and tagged 'and Leeds' on to it,\" said Robinson, who had six years at Leeds before joining Tottenham in 2004.\n\n\"Week in, week out, no matter what league they are in or who they are playing against, Leeds fans take great pride week in describing their dislike of Manchester United.\"\n\nLeeds go into the game in better form, having added a goalless New Year's Day draw draw at Anfield to their home comeback against Arne Slot's men to take their current unbeaten record to six games and seven points clear of relegation in 16th place. It is their best top-flight form since April 2021, when Marcelo Bielsa was in charge.\n\nRegardless, Robinson believes there are some Leeds fans for whom a successful season this time around would be to finish 17th and beat Manchester United.\n\n\"That does exist,\" said Gary Edwards. \"I'm not quite like that, but 100% there are fans who think that way.\n\n\"I just feel it is as good a time to play them as any because we have turned a corner.\n\n\"We've kept the same formation and the same players who looked dire at the start of the season are now assured and confident.\n\n\"It will make the game interesting. Very, very interesting.\"",

Over-promoted and out of his depth.\n\nA first half at Celtic Park that offered such promise made way for another second half of dismal collapse. They had Rangers on the ropes at the break but you always sensed that they needed a second goal to put them on the floor and maybe a third just to put them out for the count. These are Celtic's frailties these days. One goal is never enough.\n\nThose goals never came despite the chances they had. Once Rangers started to fight back, they hit Celtic with three blows in 21 minutes. Ruthless. The Celtic lights went out in an instant. From light to dark in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe colossal weaknesses in Nancy's formation, the giant amounts of space conceded by his players were the problem again. That and their inability to stay in the fight. Was their feeble demise a window to their collective soul, a reflection of their spirit under the new, and surely doomed, manager? It looked like that. A lost dressing room? Perhaps. Just because it's a cliche doesn't mean it isn't true.",

Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Schiffrin's record-breaking careers have elevated female skiing's profile above male skiing in many countries.\n\nCloser to home my co-presenter Chemmy Alcott was a consistent top-10 campaigner in alpine and Jenny Jones, Izzy and Zoe Atkin, Charlotte Bankes, Mia Brookes and Kirsty Muir have outshone the men, claiming numerous British firsts with World Cup, World Championship and X Games titles.\n\nJenny and Izzy have both won Olympic medals and it is impossible not to dream, looking at Mia, Kirsty, Charlotte and Zoe's form, that the 2026 Winter Games in Milan in February might produce Team GB's first ever gold on snow.",

I love this club, but I can't guarantee anything. Nobody can.\n\n\"I could say I'm going to stay here for years and then get fired.\"\n\nAbout having contact with Chelsea, he said: \"There are discussions because we're part of the same group.\"\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at his career to date.",

The Argentina forward scored 91 goals in 2012.\n\nLamine Yamal is only 18 but it feels like he has been on the scene for a while as he regularly makes the headlines for his standout performances.\n\nHe shone for Spain as they won Euro 2024 last year and has continued to rise in 2025.\n\nThe teenager has seven goals and eight assists after 14 La Liga games for Barcelona so far this season.\n\nIn the first half of this year, he scored 11 goals and provided 10 assists for club and country.\n\nOusmane Dembele made an incredible start to 2025 as he scored 15 goals in his first eight games of the year on his way to finishing the 2024-25 campaign with 35 goals in 53 games - by far and away his best goalscoring form in any season.\n\nThe 28-year-old's performances on the pitch saw him win his first Ballon d'Or and although the goals haven't quite flowed as well so far this term, it has nevertheless been a brilliant year for the France forward.\n\nIt takes a brave person not to captain Erling Haaland in their Fantasy Premier League team because the Manchester City striker, 25, has been simply sensational in front of goal this season.\n\nHe has scored 25 goals in just 24 appearances this season while he was in equally deadly form for Norway as he helped them qualify for a first World Cup since 1998 by scoring 16 goals in their eight qualifiers.\n\nThis has been a difficult season so far for Cole Palmer with injury limiting his game time but he was the standout player at this summer's Club World Cup and was a key player for Chelsea last season.\n\nHe helped the Blues secure a return to the Champions League for this season, provided two vital assists as Chelsea beat Real Betis in the Conference League final and then was named player of the tournament at the Club World Cup, outshining some of the biggest teams and players in world football.\n\nPalmer, 23, scored three goals and provided two assists, with no other player surpassing his five goal involvements.\n\nGiven they won the Treble, Paris St-Germain players were always going to dominate this list.\n\nGoals and assists often grab the headlines but 23-year-old Nuno Mendes has cemented himself as one of the best left-backs in the world right now after some superb displays at full-back for PSG.\n\nGoalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who joined Manchester City from PSG in the summer, was named Fifa's best men's goalkeeper for 2025 earlier this month.\n\nThe Italy international was recognised for an exceptional year in which he won the Champions League for the first time and three domestic trophies with PSG.\n\nThe 26-year-old has since established himself as a key member of Pep Guardiola's City, who currently sit second in the Premier League and fourth in the Champions League.\n\nPedri, 23, who arguably enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career in 2024-25 as he helped Barcelona win the domestic treble, is now regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world.\n\nHe had the most recoveries (254) among players in the top five European leagues last term and also showed he is one of the best chance creators in Europe as he created 70 chances for his Barcelona team-mates last season.\n\nWith injury issues seemingly behind him, he is continuing to play an important part for Barcelona this season and has helped them to sit top of La Liga, ahead of rivals Real Madrid.\n\nIt has been a prolific 2025 for Kylian Mbappe, who has scored 59 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid this year.\n\nThis means the 27-year-old striker has equalled the record number of goals scored in a calendar year which was set by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013.\n\nGiven the unglamorous nature of the role, a defensive midfielder has to be very, very good to be considered the best player in the world, but Vitinha, 25, has certainly been very, very good in 2025.\n\nCompared to the legendary Andres Iniesta, Vitinha possesses brilliant technique and positioning which help him to dominate games from the middle of the park for Paris St-Germain.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "In the moment England secured an Ashes victory over Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Paul Baker shed a tear.\n\nThe last time England won in Melbourne, 15 years ago, Paul and his wife Lisa were in the city with seven-year-old son Josh – cricket-mad and his life ahead of him.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Josh would go on to play 47 games for Worcestershire. He tragically died from an undiagnosed heart condition at the age of 20 in May 2024.\n\nWithout him, Lisa and Paul are back in Australia. The stars of England's win at the MCG were Josh's old team-mates Josh Tongue and Jacob Bethell.\n\n\"It was a moment of reflection,\" Paul tells BBC Sport. \"It was lovely to see England win at the MCG. I've got fond memories of sharing the moment with Josh in 2010.\"\n\nThe Bakers are regular Ashes tourists. They first came to watch England down under for the 2002-03 series when Lisa was five months pregnant with Josh.\n\nPaul is a former second XI captain at Redditch Cricket Club. Lisa knew nothing of the game before she met Paul, but was soon indoctrinated. Cricket was always going to be a huge part of Josh's life, including witnessing the Melbourne and Sydney Tests on England's Ashes-winning tour in 2010-11.\n\n\"He loved the Barmy Army, the singing and the chanting,\" says Paul. \"His eyes were on stalks, capturing everything that was going on. We took him to the Barmy Army pub one night and he loved it.\"\n\nThe Bakers have strong ties to Australia. The family has housed Australian overseas players and Josh played in Sydney during the winter before he passed away.\n\nFor the first Ashes without Josh, there was nowhere else Lisa and Paul wanted to be.\n\n\"Life is too short,\" says Lisa. \"Josh was an only child. We just thought 'let's do it'.\n\n\"It's tough because the memories keep popping up on my phone. They're wonderful, but they absolutely break your heart. I look back at them and that was when we were happy. That's so difficult. Not that we're not happy now, but it's very different.\"",

Really not bothered. You guys pay for tickets and you pay for my prize so thanks for booing me,\" the 18-year-old told Sky Sports following his victory.\n\n\"No-one wanted me to win but I proved them wrong yet again.\"\n\nBelgium's Mike de Decker, the world number 18 and 2024 World Grand Prix champion, complained on Instagram about the boos after he was beaten in the first round by unranked Kenyan David Munyua.\n\nHe said that booing \"shouldn't be something that's normal or supported\".\n\nLittler has previously been subjected to booing in overseas tournaments and world number nine Gerwyn Price famously wore ear defenders in 2023 to block out the crowd noise.",

One lucky fan in attendance will also receive £60,000 from the tournament sponsor, as will Prostate Cancer UK.\n\nWhat is dartitis and what causes it?\n\nLittler entered as favourite off the back of winning six major finals in 2025.\n\nLuke Humphries, Littler's predecessor as both world champion and world number one, faced Littler in three finals this year and is the current world number two.\n\nWorld number three Michael van Gerwen is also in the mix, looking to avenge last year's final defeat and add to his three world titles, with his most recent coming in 2019.\n\nYoung players making a big run at the World Championship include Josh Rock and Gian van Veen, whose respective form saw them both enter the world's top 12 before the tournament.\n\nBeau Greaves topped this year's Women's Series and carried the highest hopes of becoming only the second female player to win a match in the tournament, after Fallon Sherrock won twice at the event in December 2019.\n\nShe took 22nd seed Daryl Gurney to a deciding set but just fell short of a place in the second round.\n\nThree qualification places were on offer from the Women's Series, along with a spot for the Women's Matchplay winner, a title taken by Lisa Ashton.\n\nAshton lost 3-0 to 2023 world champion Michael Smith in the first round on 11 December.\n\nWith Greaves qualifying in her own right as runner-up on the development tour, that meant Women's Series runner-up Sherrock, Noa-Lynn van Leuven in fourth and Gemma Hayter, who finished fifth, joined third-placed Ashton.\n\nVan Leuven, who became the first transgender player to appear at the tournament last year, was beaten by two-time champion Peter Wright this time.\n\nSherrock lost in straight sets in the first round to Dave Chisnall, while Hayter took a set off Northern Ireland's World Cup winner Rock in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nThe format is set play, unlike other tournaments which are a race to a number of legs.\n\nA set consists of the best of five legs or race to three.\n\nOnly in matches where players are level on sets and legs in the deciding set do players need to win by two clear legs.\n\nFirst and second round: Best of five sets\n\nThird and fourth round: Best of seven sets\n\nQuarter-finals: Best of nine sets\n\nPhil Taylor is the most successful player in the history of the PDC World Darts Championship, winning 14 of his 16 world titles between 1995 and 2013.\n\nHis previous two titles came before a group of leading players broke away from the British Darts Organisation to form their own governing body, now known as the PDC, in 1993.\n\nThe past five years have produced five different world champions, with English trio Littler, Humphries and Smith winning the past three.\n\nLittler and Humphries will hope to join the exclusive club of players to have won multiple PDC world titles, with only six managing to achieve that feat so far.\n\nTwo players hit nine-darters during the 2025 World Darts Championship.\n\nDutchman Christian Kist was the first player to hit one, doing so in a first-round defeat by Madars Razma.\n\nAustralia's Damon Heta hit one in the third round, but like Kist it came in a defeat as he went out to Luke Woodhouse.\n\nThroughout the tournament, there will be daily round-ups on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be live text coverage of the biggest matches as the tournament progresses.\n\nDuring Thursday's opening night, there was a dedicated preview show on BBC Radio 5 Live, featuring interviews with Littler, Humphries and Van Gerwen. Presenter James Gregg will provide updates on BBC Sounds throughout the competition.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nAsk Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.\n\nWe want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.\n\nThe team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.\n\nWe will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.\n\nOur coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.\n\nHow do darts world rankings work?\n\nWho is Arsenal teenager Salmon?\n\nWhy is Steve Smith wearing black tape under his eyes?\n\nWhen is the FA Cup third round draw?",

    "description": "BBC Sport reflects on a stellar year for South Africa which threatens to be overshadowed by a lack of home Test cricket.",
    "fullText": "From a certain vantage point, the health of Test cricket in South Africa appears terminal.\n\nFor the first time since sporting isolation during apartheid, there will be no red-ball action in the country this summer. Instead, fans must make do watching Indian-owned T20 franchises compete in the SA20.\n\nThe next time the Proteas take the field in whites on home soil will be October 2026, 21 months after hosting Pakistan in January this year.\n\nAnd yet the Test team itself has rarely looked in better shape, with 2025 proving a watershed year.\n\nRyan Rickelton registered his country's first double century for nine years as Pakistan were swept 2–0. In June, a sublime fourth-innings 136 from Aiden Markram, allied to a nine-wicket match haul from Kagiso Rabada, carried South Africa to a five-wicket victory over Australia in the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's.\n\nAnd with the choker's tag finally dislodged, and momentum behind them, South Africa are on track to qualify for another WTC final.\n\nWiaan Mulder threatened Brian Lara's record for the highest Test score when he declared himself on 367 against Zimbabwe in July. In October, Keshav Maharaj bagged a seven-for in Rawalpindi to square the series with Pakistan.\n\nA month later, Simon Harmer claimed 17 wickets in two Tests as South Africa beat India 2-0 in their own backyard, becoming the first South African team to win away in India since 2000.\n\n\"It's been a remarkable period for us,\" says Sunuran Muthusamy, the spin-bowling all-rounder who scored his maiden century in the 408-run win in the second Test against India.\n\n\"We're straight into the SA20 so it's hard to really take stock. But in the small moments when we've had a chance to reflect, we know that we've found a great formula. It feels like things are really clicking.\"",
