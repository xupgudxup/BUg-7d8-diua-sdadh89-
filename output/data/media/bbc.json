    "description": "After a weekend of FA Cup action without VAR, BBC Sport ask managers, fans and pundits whether the game needs technology - and what needs to change.",
    "fullText": "Would football be better without the video assistant referee (VAR) system?\n\nPremier League fans, managers and players got a reminder of what life was like without VAR in the FA Cup fourth round - and it is fair to say this weekend was not without its problems.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, VAR has not been brought in until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nAfter a season full of controversy, delayed decisions and confusion fuelled by VAR, its very existence has been questioned at times, with many claiming the game would be better without it.\n\nIn fact, after a day full of long delays, mixed messages and irate managers in early February, ex-Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Match of the Day: \"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\"\n\nAfter a couple of offside goals being allowed, a blatant penalty not being awarded plus various other controversial decisions, the weekend certainly brought the subject back into the public eye.\n\nLong delays, irate managers and mixed messages - is VAR bad for game?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nWe have all heard the arguments against VAR.\n\nDecisions taking too long, celebrations being put on hold while deliberations take place, confusion as goals are given - or ruled out - for marginal reasons, denying referees the ability to use their own common sense.\n\nBut Newcastle's controversial 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday could hardly have gone better for supporters of VAR - or worse for those who argue football is better without it.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener was clearly offside, Villa's full-back Lucas Digne inexplicably escaped conceding a penalty for handball and the Frenchman could easily have been dismissed for a reckless challenge as well.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold, especially us today when we were on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery went further, saying \"VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees\".\n\nThere was also some controversy at Anfield during Liverpool's 3-0 win over Brighton.\n\nSubstitute Rio Ngumoha, 17, had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside for the hosts, while the Seagulls were furious Mohamed Salah was awarded a penalty.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"In general, I enjoy watching football without VAR because if you then score you're like 'it's a goal'.\n\n\"I like VAR only for the clear and obvious things - I'm not meaning a red card yes or no for Marc Guehi on Mo Salah because I thought it was.\n\n\"So let's stay away from that and only go to offside yes or no, ball over the line yes or no and, for the rest, the referee referees the game.\n\n\"I think we're now so used to VAR that I would prefer to have VAR during a game.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola was unsure whether football was better with VAR, despite seeing Omar Marmoush denied a goal for a debatable offside in his side's 3-0 win against Salford.\n\n\"Sometimes before I thought it was better and sometimes I think VAR helps us to have a more fair game,\" he said. \"To be honest I don't know.\"\n\nFor some though, it is simple - rather than VAR being a solution for wrong decisions, they would argue officials just need to get things right.\n\nWhen asked on Match of the Day Live whether the errors at Villa Park put him in favour of VAR, ex-Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, said: \"No. I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it?\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think Saturday is a great example of that.\n\n\"These guys look petrified to make a decision because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\n\n\"For me, [referees' decisions] are actually getting worse.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given added on Match of the Day: \"It shows you why we use VAR. A lot of decisions the officials got wrong at Villa Park. VAR is like a comfort blanket for referees.\n\n\"The decision is taken away from the officials. The linesman has been told all season not to put their flag up, so their brain has been trained. I think it shows VAR is a help even though we complain about it most weeks.\"\n\nWhen asked whether football had become too reliant on VAR, Howe had some sympathy with the argument.\n\n\"There is an argument to say yes,\" he said. \"Because when VAR is there, there is a tendency to think 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'.\n\n\"Then your decision making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there. I would probably say you are right in that respect.\"\n\nBut former referee Graham Scott feels it is unfair to claim officials hide behind VAR.\n\n\"I really don't think that's fair,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"Obviously I work with them closely and I know these guys and they're not like that. It's not how their minds work, not how their processes work.\n\n\"I spent half my career with VAR and half without it - the other way around of course, without it first.\n\n\"And then when I was in the Premier League I was still dropping into the Championship quite often. So you're in and out, in and out. And your processes essentially stay the same.\n\n\"What has changed though is with VAR you don't have that spell in a game where you know you've made a really big error and you now have to reset and go again.\"\n\nJames: Football without VAR is real football. Having gone to games for the last 30 years, the last few years have been terrible in comparison. I don't bother cheering goals any more as the officials are far more interested in finding ways of disallowing goals than the entertainment of the match-going fan.\n\nVAR will be the thing that makes me turn in my season ticket, and if West Ham do get relegated the lack of VAR will be a blessing.\n\nFrank: I supported the introduction of VAR, but it was great not having it today. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many VAR ridiculous errors.\n\nAlan: Much, much better [without]. VAR has ruined the game, thankfully I now support non-league football where there are humans, making human mistakes and getting it right.\n\nStephen: Much better without VAR. No waiting for obvious incidents that everyone can see immediately but takes VAR forever to decide. Time for return of refs and linesman to start refereeing the game again.\n\nMike: Better, even though City probably had a goal chalked off incorrectly. Right or wrong, its so much better to just know immediately if its a goal or not. VAR is a moment-killer.\n\nLes: The game is so much better without VAR. It flows without problem like it used to do. The officials are there to make decisions rightly or wrongly. VAR are always making wrong calls so I can't see the point of it. Offside because someone's toes are on the lines drawn is absolutely pathetic.\n\nBonnie: As a Villa and VAR fan, that is exactly the decision that VAR doesn't get credit for. VAR gets it right 100%\n\nRoger: That was so blatantly offside, have linesman lost their natural ability to spot stuff like this since the introduction of VAR? Whenever you see a defence hold their line like Newcastle did, strikers are more often than not offside. Poor decision.\n\nPeter: There's an easy fix for VAR offsides. If you can watch one TV replay and see the on-field decision is clearly wrong, you intervene.\n\nStephen: That's what you all wanted isn't it? More goals regardless of whether they're actually fair or not?\n\nLiga: It's these types of situations and these types of situation only where VAR should and needs to be used for offsides. Not those hairline millimetre is he on or off line drawing nonsense situations.\n\nCallum: This season is proving 2 things. 1) VAR is a must. 2) Brave, high pressure attacking football is dead.\n\nBen: What are linesman for exactly? Having no VAR is a another shambles, who makes these decisions?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "BBC Scotland looks at Youssef Chermiti's impact for Rangers against Hearts and beyond.",
    "fullText": "A multi-million pound signing, openly derided and much-maligned. Yet, in the two biggest games of Rangers' season, he's been the hero.\n\nYoussef Chermiti cost the Ibrox club a fee of around £8m in the summer, having not scored a goal in two years.\n\nHis name was attached to criticism of former sporting director Kevin Thelwell, with his unconvincing early performances only adding fuel to the fire of his doubters.\n\nYet, against Celtic in the new year's derby, he came good. His two goals shot Rangers to a 3-1 win at Celtic Park, leading to Wilfried Nancy being sacked and pushing Danny Rohl's side past Celtic in the Scottish Premiership table for the first time this season.\n\nOn Sunday, he started in the biggest game of the season so far against league leaders Hearts. Trailing by five points, a win was a must.\n\nThanks to Chermiti, that's what they got.\n\nWith the weight of the world on his shoulders, the Portuguese striker scored a first ever career hat-trick and heaved a chunk of momentum back behind Rangers in the title charge.\n\nWatch: Rangers v Hearts - Sportscene highlights\n\nThe strangest thing about all this - Chermiti has scored just seven league goals this season. Five of them in two games. Two big games, right enough, but two games all the same.\n\nInterestingly enough, he is actually outperforming his xG of just 5.21, despite some notable misses.\n\nThe 21-year-old ranks just 15th in the league's strikers in that metric. When you look at his touches in the opposition box - 60 in total - he ranks down in 26th.\n\nIn 15 league games, 10 of which were starts, he went goalless. Before the 4-2 win over Hearts, he had drawn a blank in his past six games.\n\nFor all that, his impact in big games is immeasurable. Yet, pundit Michael Stewart remains unconvinced.\n\n\"He scored a hat-trick today, which is wonderful for him, but his all-round game is a little bit slack, and his touch at times is very unpredictable,\" said Stewart on Sportscene.\n\nThe opinion that really matters, though, is that of his gaffer and Rohl is clearly a big fan.\n\n\"You give him belief and trust,\" the head coach said through the week, when asked about his striker.\n\n\"You can imagine for Youssef, it's tough for him. Not about the reaction [from fans], it's more about how he feels.\n\n\"He knows he wants to score. He wants a lot for the group. He comes in a good situation. I wish that the next time he takes an extra touch and then he looks for the corner, he makes it.\n\n\"It will come, I totally believe, because I see a lot of things in him.\n\n\"It was the Celtic game when he scored, he turned the game with fantastic goals, and he can do this again. I believe, totally.\"\n\nNot a bad prediction from the 36-year-old, who has masterminded Rangers' resurgent form.\n\nPodcast: Dramatic Sunday in Premiership as Celtic & Rangers narrow gap on leaders Hearts\n\nIn Rohl's first weekend as Rangers boss, they leapt from eighth to fifth thanks to a 3-1 win over Kilmarnock, which featured Chermiti's first goal for the Ibrox club. They were 13 points behind Hearts before a ball was kicked.\n\nYet now, with 11 games of this rollercoaster season left, Rangers are just two behind Derek McInnes' pacesetters.\n\nIt's a turnaround that few could have predicted, and many Rangers fans had already effectively written the league off.\n\nIn 19 league matches in charge, Rohl has won 14, drawn four and lost just one - to Hearts at Tynecastle Park back in December.\n\n\"It's not been pretty for Rangers for the most of this season,\" former Rangers midfielder Scott Arfield said on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. \"Danny Rohl has gone in there and quietly got this team firing again.\"\n\nThe importance of the new head coach cannot be understated, and even caught the eye of Scotland boss Steve Clarke.\n\n\"He's found a way of playing that suits the squad of players that he's got,\" Clarke said on Sky Sports. \"He showed midweek [against Motherwell] that he's not afraid to make changes, so he trusts his squad.\n\n\"When you win matches you get more confidence. If you come in as a manager and start by winning games, immediately the players are going to be onside.\n\n\"The players are with him, the crowd are with him as well. It's been a really good run for Rangers and they're certainly doing very well at the moment.\"\n\nChermiti hat-trick earns Rangers seismic win over leaders Hearts\n\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "It will go down as one of the strangest FA Cup finals on record.\n\nArsenal's 2-1 win over Chelsea in 2020 was played at a near-deserted Wembley while the Gunners received the trophy on the pitch, instead of climbing the famous steps to the Royal Box for the presentation as is tradition.\n\nDespite fans being prevented from attending the domestic showpiece becaue of Covid, it was a day Matt Smith will never forget.\n\nAged 19 and without a competitive first-team appearance to his name, the boyhood Arsenal fan was named on the Gunners substitutes bench after Mesut Ozil was left out, external by Mikel Arteta.\n\nAfter the full-time whistle confirmed the first and - as of right now - only major trophy of Arteta's reign, Smith received a winners' medal and had his picture taken with fellow substitute Bukayo Saka on the pitch with the FA Cup.\n\nSix years on and Smith, who now plays in midfield for Wigan Athletic, returns to Emirates Stadium on Sunday when the League One strugglers face Premier League leaders Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup (16:30 GMT kick-off).\n\n\"It was mad really because it was when the whole thing surrounding Ozil was going on,\" Smith, 25, tells BBC Sport about his memories of the 2020 final.\n\n\"He wasn't in the squad so I was getting on the bench. I was on the bench for the quarter-final at Sheffield United, the semi-final with Manchester City and then the final.\n\n\"When you're that young you don't really understand the importance of being part of the FA Cup final or the memories it's going to give you for the rest of your life.\n\n\"It's only now I realise how grateful I was to be involved in something so special like that.\n\n\"I remember getting my suit for the final and it being way too big for me. I didn't want to say anything because I was young.\n\n\"All the other players' suits were tailored but mine was massive - they must have done it wrong.\n\n\"I didn't make it on to the pitch but that day will live with me forever.\"\n\nSmith grew up with posters of former Gunners captain Cesc Fabregas on his bedroom wall.\n\n\"My whole family are massive Arsenal fans,\" he says. \"When I was younger I used to watch a lot of Arsenal games with my dad - we went to most home games.\"\n\nAfter joining at the age of seven, Smith spent 15 years at Arsenal, going on to captain the under-18s while also appearing in the 2018 FA Youth Cup final with Saka.\n\n\"He was a year below me but he was so good that he would always play in a higher age group,\" Smith says of Arsenal's current number seven.\n\n\"When he got to 16 or 17 he overtook me.\"\n\nYet such was Smith's potential that he was invited to train with the first team as a 17-year-old, while his name appeared frequently on the team sheet as a substitute towards the end of 2019-20.\n\n\"I'd grown up watching these players on television and suddenly I found myself training with them.\"\n\nHe recalls the methods Arteta employed at pre-match team meetings to keep players engaged, including games of Pictionary - the game based on drawing - focusing on opposition players and tactics.\n\n\"It was very different to other team meetings,\" adds Smith, who had loan spells at Swindon Town, Charlton Athletic and Doncaster Rovers while at Arsenal.\n\n\"It would always be a game to get the energy and camaraderie up.\n\n\"It was all about getting our brains switched on, getting everyone communicating with one another.\n\n\"There were games of Pictionary relating to the opposition and everything you had learned throughout the week.\n\n\"Instead of it all being written down on a board and players just sitting there not really taking it in, he made it fun and different.\"\n\nSmith joined Wigan in 2023 after his Arsenal contract expired.\n\nDespite his disappointment at being released, he remembers his last conversation with Arteta and the advice the Spaniard gave him before wishing him luck with his career.\n\n\"He told me that throughout my career people are going to tell me what my weaknesses are and what I need to work on.\n\n\"But he also said 'make your strengths your super-strengths, whenever you get on the pitch do what you're good at and make that your thing'.\n\n\"That's something that has stuck with me.\"\n\nSmith adds: \"He's such a good manager. He used to tell me stuff that I'd never heard before that made me see the game in a different way.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time before Arsenal start winning trophies regularly.\n\n\"They've been close the last couple of seasons but haven't been able to get over the line. They've now got the squad to do it. They are one of the best sides in Europe right now.\"\n\nSmith's parents, Gerrard and Kate, were unable to attend Wembley in 2020 because of Covid restrictions but they will be at Emirates Stadium to watch their son against his former club on Sunday.\n\nHis sister, Amy, will be there too.\n\nWith Wigan selling all of their 5,000 tickets, it will be the first time he has played in front of a 60,000 full house.\n\n\"I've not been back to Arsenal since leaving three years ago,\" says Smith, who is looking forward to catching up with some familiar faces, including Gunners captain Martin Odegaard.\n\nOn Smith's final day with the Gunners, Odegaard presented him with one of his armbands and an Arsenal shirt signed by all the players.\n\n\"That was a really nice gesture,\" adds Smith.\n\n\"He's a good captain to be fair. He's not the loudest but he leads by example and has played at the highest level.\"\n\nSo, what happened to his FA Cup winners' medal?\n\n\"It's at my mum and dad's house.\"\n\nDoes Smith look at it regularly?\n\n\"Not at all. I think the last time I saw it was two years ago. I'll have plenty of time to look at it when I retire. Hopefully, I've got a few more years before I pack in playing.\"",

    "title": "Is Zubimendi Arsenal's best player?",
    "description": "After an impressive start to his Arsenal career, BBC Sport looks at whether Martin Zubimendi is the Gunners' most important player.",
    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta recently hinted that Arsenal's \"best player\" is somebody who has only been with the club a matter of months - summer signing Martin Zubimendi.\n\nIt may have gone unnoticed at the time but, speaking after the Gunners' tight 1-0 win over Crystal Palace in October, manager Arteta lavished praise on the £60m midfield man - saying Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta had been tasked with defending Arsenal's \"best player\".\n\nIt is for good reason that Arteta rates one of his more recent signings so highly. Zubimendi has been justifying his manager's comments since signing from boyhood club Real Sociedad in July 2025.\n\nThe 27-year-old has played the most minutes of any of Arsenal's outfield players and has been chipping in with goals too.\n\nAnd that goal return may have come as a surprise, with Zubimendi signed primarily as a defensive midfielder but now having scored six times in 34 appearances - the most he has registered during any campaign in his career.\n\nArsenal and Arteta made a big play to recruit Zubimendi and started the work to try to sign him 12 months before he arrived at the club, initially discussing the possibility when they were completing a deal for his Sociedad team-mate Mikel Merino in the summer of 2024.\n\nZubimendi was brought in to be a crucial component of the Arsenal squad, with his passing ability, on-pitch intelligence and history of winning important trophies.\n\nIndeed, the Spain international played an important role in his country beating England in the Euro 2024 final.\n\nHis signing has also given midfield team-mate Declan Rice the licence to take his attacking game to the next level.\n\nArteta has spoken previously about how chaos and attacking more directly were effective ways for Arsenal to create chances when Zubimendi's influence was blunted by being man-marked.\n\nAnd from this we can infer that Zubimendi - Arsenal's \"best player\" - is most important when it comes to breaking down teams in the manner Arteta prefers, with measured, sustained possession.\n\nZubimendi was pursued by Liverpool in 2024 and Reds boss Arne Slot made no secret of his desire for a defensive midfielder who is able to receive the ball behind strikers pressing his defenders, rather than coming to get the ball. Zubimendi excels at this.\n\nAnd the former Sociedad man's ability to sprint at the right time in order to show for the ball before progressing play - whether through a first-time pass, a timely dribble or a punchy pass through the line - has elevated Arsenal's build-up this season.\n\nMeanwhile, aerially, Zubimendi directs headers with a level of finesse, finding team-mates rather than simply looking to head the ball away.\n\nBuild-up play and the ability to break up attacks is to be expected of a £60m defensive midfielder but the way Arteta has used Zubimendi as an attacking tool has stood out, suggesting this is an area where marginal gains can be found in football going forward.\n\nZubimendi, Rice and Martin Odegaard's positions on paper may seem obvious but they show flexibility, built upon the versatility of all three players and their understanding of when to move - similar to the Paris St-Germain midfield that won the Champions League last season.\n\nArsenal's players rotate positions to make it difficult for opponents to pick them up. They aim to maintain the balance of the side while playing in this fluid manner. Zubimendi, like the others, vacates his position based on the movements of team-mates.\n\nIt is unusual to see a defensive midfielder make such adventurous runs off the ball but it appears to be the next step on from the more popular use of roaming full-backs, such as Riccardo Calafiori, Nuno Mendes and Marc Cucurella.\n\nThe logic is that the players often tasked with marking defensive players are unlikely to defend them as closely. Finding defensive players who possess attacking quality to contribute in the final third is a rarity but Zubimendi has the skillset to punish teams in this way.\n\nDefences set up in a low block will often drop even deeper when faced with a winger or forward trying to run in-behind. It leads to space opening up in front of the defence, rather than in the box.\n\nArsenal spend large parts of the game looking to unlock deep defences. This allows Zubimendi to arrive into a position to receive a pass, without being picked up, before executing on the idea he has in his head immediately. This could be a precise through ball or a dinked chip over the top - riskier passes that pose new questions for deep defences.\n\nAlternatively, when Zubimendi sits at the base of midfield, Rice is free to push up and rotate with the attackers, knowing there is protection behind him.\n\nAnd the England man will likely feel safe to play freely after seeing his 5ft 9in team-mate beat 6ft 6in Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade to a header earlier this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Zubimendi's willingness to shoot from distance provided Arsenal with the much-needed opening goal against Nottingham Forest and Sunderland, after which more space opened up for the Gunners with their opposition forced to play more adventurously.\n\nArteta said \"if the space is not in one place, it will be somewhere else\" - and against deep defences, long shots have become an increasingly viable tactic this season.\n\nSigning Zubimendi, therefore, could not have been more timely.\n\nArteta has never been shy in praising Zubimendi.\n\nThe midfielder's six goals this season also match the tally he scored for Real Sociedad in his last two seasons at the club (six goals in 93 games).\n\nZubimendi got the opening goals against Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Sunderland, while he also scored Arsenal's third in the 3-2 win over Chelsea in their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg.\n\n\"I think when we talk about Zubi, what else can he do? He can do whatever he wants. It's a bit similar to Declan's qualities,\" Arteta said, speaking after that match.\n\n\"We just have to keep unlocking that in his system, in his brain, because he's so good at occupying different spaces, he's carrying the ball, dribbling, winning duels, and he has a talent when he gets into the final third and into the box. He's so composed. He sees the picture very clear.\n\n\"The picture actually is clear sometimes that I know the parts of the pitch and what he's done today. I think it's phenomenal, not only the ball but the performance as well.\"\n\nThe midfielder is tasked with stopping opponents' attacks and starting Arsenal's, and with the final part of the season approaching and trophies on the line, he could be more important than ever.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses the potential long-term impact of England's defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield, and the challenge of facing Ireland at Allianz Stadium on Saturday.\n\nI can easily reel off the losses that stuck with me in the Six Nations, as they can take you to a really dark place at times.\n\nScotland 2000, Ireland 2001 and France 2002 - they all still hurt.\n\nI was involved in all those campaigns and came up short of a Grand Slam by one victory three consecutive times.\n\nIt is important now to take stock and remember that defeat will happen again at some point before the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\n\nEngland will lick their wounds after yet another crushing defeat by Scotland, but even if a potential Grand Slam has gone, they still have a championship to play for.\n\nThe chance to win a Grand Slam does not come around very often, and that is the reality.\n\nLast week I said it would be foolish to draw a straight line from the opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider in Paris.\n\nThis tournament is magical for exactly that reason.\n\nTwo wins and England will be in a position to go to Paris and perhaps try to win the championship.\n\nThere is plenty to focus on and be excited about, and that Murrayfield pain will make England a better team.\n\nBig away wins are not easy in the Six Nations, and Saturday is another one that eluded Steve Borthwick.\n\nIt is not just about winning on another pitch as the World Cup is on neutral soil in Australia.\n\nIt is about the different feeling outside the Twickenham environment and home comforts.\n\nAs impressive as the 12-game winning run was, England still need that South African mentality - wherever you go in the world, you are expected to win and be globally successful.\n\nBorthwick is still yet to travel to Scotland, Ireland or France in the Six Nations and win.\n\nMost adversity comes from playing away from home, and Saturday gave the England players more of those scenarios.\n\nIt is very unlikely they will win a World Cup without a statement away victory beforehand.\n\nThere is a lot happening in these high-pressure games, and for high-paced players it is happening more quickly both physically and mentally.\n\nUnfortunately for Henry Arundell, who was being ultra-competitive, you have to read situations like the one when he took out Kyle Steyn in the air.\n\nEngland found themselves in a position where they were not playing well and were losing the scraps.\n\nIn those situations, you need clarity as well as competitiveness, and a red card obviously does not help to swing the momentum back.\n\nThat decision has cost England dearly and, given how competitive that wing slot is, I am sure Borthwick is going to have to manage that scenario.\n\nHenry is a 23-year-old and will, of course, bounce back, but it was reckless and a poor decision.\n\nWhat if that had been a championship decider or a World Cup knockout game?\n\nYou have to make good decisions under pressure. Being in those situations more often will help players learn.\n\nSix Nations: Scotland regain the Calcutta Cup\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nEngland will be licking their lips at the opportunity to bounce back against Ireland on Saturday.\n\nWe know England can perform with the comfort of home support, so it is not about putting things right - that will come in games in Rome and Paris.\n\nIt is about building on what they did prior to the Scotland game. Sometimes you have to park a game, write it off and move on.\n\nI thought I had seen England drift away from the kick-heavy style and strategy.\n\nScotland put on an attacking masterclass, whereas when England did attack it felt like they were punching for their lives but not actually landing anything.\n\nThey lacked shape, going left and right without making any progress - like a boxer on the ropes punching for their life but not actually hitting anything.\n\nGeorge Ford's failed drop-goal felt like a last-ditch option, which then resulted in what Borthwick described as a 10-point swing.\n\nI do not think you can blame Ford, the sequence was not set up properly and it felt like tired minds all over the place.\n\nDealing with a fast and furious game is, once again, a learning curve to take forward.\n\nTwo years ago there was plenty of talk that Ireland were going to beat England by 30 points at Twickenham.\n\nIt was such a mismatch in terms of where both sides were in their development.\n\nMarcus Smith's late drop-goal denied Ireland a potential Grand Slam, and that was a huge moment in Borthwick's tenure.\n\nNow England come in as favourites - it is amazing how quickly the landscape changes.\n\nHaving lost badly against France and nearly drawn against Italy, Ireland will be annoyed that everyone is writing them off.\n\nThey are a well-motivated team under Andy Farrell and are very well drilled.\n\nIreland will come out and probably play their best game of the campaign.\n\nScotland, in the space of a week, turned their disappointing loss in Rome into a convincing display against England.\n\nThat is how quickly things can change.\n\nDefeat next weekend and the pressure builds on England, with two difficult away fixtures to finish.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win",

    "description": "After Igor Tudor agrees to take charge of Tottenham for the remainder of the season, BBC Sport takes a look at what supporters can expect to see from his side.",
    "fullText": "Igor Tudor has agreed to take charge of Tottenham for the remainder of the season, so what can supporters expect to see from his side?\n\nFollowing his appointment as interim head coach, Tudor's first game in charge will be a significant one as Spurs host north London rivals Arsenal in the Premier League on 22 February.\n\nThat will allow the 47-year-old less than a week to attempt to implement his style of play once the players return to training on Monday - and they could be in for a shock.\n\n\"His style is intense,\" George Boxall, a football journalist based in Marseille, where Tudor managed between 2022 and 2023, tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"The players do a hell of a lot of running. There's lots of intensity, lots of pressing.\n\n\"He is a really strong personality and he could be a good appointment for Tottenham if they feel they need an electroshock.\"\n\nTudor has been out of work since being sacked by Juventus in October 2025 and is set for his first spell in England, after previously taking charge of clubs in Italy, France, Turkey, Croatia and Greece.\n\nHe is tasked, first and foremost, with easing Tottenham's relegation fears, after a 2-1 loss to Newcastle in Thomas Frank's final match on Tuesday left them five points above the bottom three.\n\nHaving earned a reputation as a no-nonsense defender during a playing career in which he won 55 caps for Croatia and made more than 150 appearances for Italian giants Juventus, there is one certain non-negotiable for Tudor as a manager.\n\n\"He asks his players to run a lot. In a previous interview he said 'If you don't run, you don't play',\" says L'Equipe journalist Pierre-Etienne Minonzio.\n\n\"In his one season in Marseille it was always the same way of playing - 3-5-2 - and it was great to watch.\n\n\"It was not easy because Marseille's best player was Dimitri Payet, a very gifted player but not well-known for running, and he didn't play.\n\n\"It was a joke in L'Equipe - if Igor Tudor had Lionel Messi in his squad, Messi would not play!\"\n\nTudor's sole season in France saw Marseille finish third behind Paris St-Germain and Lens, despite surpassing the club's points total from the previous campaign when they finished second.\n\n\"He did pretty well in Ligue 1. What I liked is that he doesn't try to be liked. He is very direct, says what he thinks and doesn't try to be attractive. There is no seduction,\" says Minonzio.\n\n\"It is the same with the players. He keeps his distance and his obsession is to make training intense with a lot of running so they can be physically fit for the game.\"\n\nTudor won back-to-back Serie A titles with Juventus in 2001-02 and 2002-03, also starting in the 2003 Champions League final, which his side lost to AC Milan.\n\nHaving begun his management career with former club Hajduk Split, Tudor had spells with Galatasaray, Udinese, Marseille and Lazio before he replaced Thiago Motta at former club Juventus in March 2025.\n\nInitially appointed as interim head coach, Tudor was given the job full-time after leading Juventus to a fourth-placed finish in Serie A and Champions League qualification.\n\n\"Tudor is an aggressive manager and that is also what he demands from his clubs,\" says Italian football journalist Daniele Verri.\n\n\"A lot of pressing. When he conquers the ball, he goes vertical. Big strong defenders. He likes to play on the wings. But the main characteristic is being aggressive.\n\n\"Juventus brought him in because he was a former player and they wanted Juventus DNA, someone fans could identify with due to his past, being aggressive, vertical, fighting hard.\"\n\nBut, according to Verri, Damien Commoli's arrival as Juventus' general manager that summer led to growing tension.\n\nTudor was sacked after just seven months following an eight-game winless run, leaving The Old Lady eighth in Serie A and 25th in the Champions League's league phase.\n\nHe departed with eight wins in 17 league games for a win rate of 47.1%.\n\n\"Commoli and Tudor never really got on. Tudor wanted more say during the transfer market, he wanted Kolo Muani to stay and that didn't happen,\" says Verri.\n\n\"He kept changing the starting 11 and that brought uncertainty. Tension grew. Tudor criticised what Juventus did in the market during press conferences, and openly criticised the players after the Lazio defeat before he was sacked.\n\n\"After a relatively good start, he lost control of the team and they stopped performing. The fans were obviously not happy, they are used to winning.\n\n\"Juventus never really had the impression they could take the next step with Tudor.\"\n\nAnalysis by BBC Sport senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel\n\nFirst of all, they wanted an interim head coach until the end of the season. And that immediately narrows the field down.\n\nWithin that, the Spurs hierarchy were looking for someone with top level managerial experience who plays attacking football.\n\nAfter reviewing their options, it is understood Spurs felt Tudor fit the bill for a few key reasons.\n\nHe has experience of working at some top European clubs – and managing big name players.\n\nTudor's reputation is for aggressive football with an attacking intent. This element was particularly important to Spurs after criticism of their style of play under Frank.\n\nTottenham are also said to have admired his work improving teams on a short-term basis.\n\nFor example, his Lazio team were unbeaten in the league for his first two months after he joined.\n\nAt Juventus, he lost only one of his first nine games. In his first full season, he was unbeaten for his first eight matches. His downfall came quickly, however, following that run after losing three away games in a week – to Real Madrid, Lazio and Como.\n\nTudor will be an interim manager and it is thought that they will be looking to secure a different, long-term option in the summer.\n\nHowever, like with Michael Carrick at Manchester United, it may well be an intriguing conundrum if he hits the ground running and sustains a good run of form through what is left of the season.\n\nHajduk Split (2013-2015): In charge for 70 games with a points per game (PPG) average of 1.63, winning the Croatian Cup in 2012-13\n\nPAOK (2015-2016): 45 matches with 1.51 PPG\n\nKarabukspor (2016-2017): 21 matches with 1.29 PPG\n\nGalatasaray (2017): 34 matches with 1.79 PPG\n\nUdinese (2018): Four matches with 1.75 PPG\n\nUdinese (second spell, 2019): 21 matches with 1.33 PPG\n\nHajduk Split (second spell, 2020): 18 matches with 1.56 PPG\n\nHellas Verona (2021-2022): 36 matches with 1.47 PPG\n\nMarseille (2022-2023): 48 matches with 1.83 PPG\n\nLazio (2024): 11 matches with 1.91 PPG\n\nJuventus (2025): 24 matches with 1.58 PPG\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Hiding pace? Too slow? What pre-season testing told us",
    "description": "BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson assesses what we learnt  - and what we didn't - from the first pre-season test in Bahrain.",
    "fullText": "There were two key talking points at the first of two pre-season tests in Bahrain - whether the new cars were still \"Formula 1\", and the performance of the new Red Bull engine.\n\nFour-time champion Max Verstappen said the revised cars and engines had turned the highest level of motorsport into an exercise in \"management\".\n\n\"As a pure driver, I enjoy driving flat out,\" Verstappen said. \"And at the moment, you cannot drive like that. A lot of what you do as a driver, in terms of inputs, has a massive effect on the energy side of things. For me, that's just not Formula 1.\"\n\nThe reigning world champion Lando Norris did not agree, saying the new cars were \"a lot of fun\" and pointing out that Verstappen was welcome to race somewhere else if he didn't like it.\n\nMercedes' George Russell - who has a tense relationship with Verstappen and a friendly, wind-up one with Norris - was somewhere in the middle.\n\n\"If you've got the best cars for us to enjoy, it doesn't mean it's going to give the best racing,\" said Russell. \"And you can argue potentially the racing will be a bit more chaotic.\"\n\nRed Bull advantage 'pretty scary', says Russell\n\nIf you watched the hour's worth of coverage shown on television at the end of each day, you might have been wondering what all the fuss was about.\n\nThe cars are clearly different in some ways from previous years, but they still look and sound recognisably like F1 cars on a superficial level.\n\nIn the cockpits, though, they are very different, as a consequence of the biggest regulation change in the sport's history.\n\nThe cars, engines and tyres are all built to new rules this year and they are running for the first time on carbon-neutral sustainable fuel.\n\nThe engines are at the heart of the drivers' concerns, whether enjoying the cars or not.\n\nThe cars are energy starved - the electrical part of the engine now produces about half its total power, while the batteries are about the same size as last year.\n\nThe various ways of recovering the energy so it can be deployed to maximum lap-time effect are changing the traditional sense of what being a racing driver is about.\n\nThe demand for energy recovery is forcing teams to run the electrical motors against the engines along the straights and in the corners.\n\nThat means the engines have to rev high in the corners, so drivers are using lower gears. As Russell pointed out, drivers have to take the corners in ways that maximise energy use over a lap, rather than simply go as fast as they can at all times. As a consequence, they will not always be on the limit of grip.\n\nVeteran Fernando Alonso, a two-time world champion who is regarded by his peers with the highest possible levels of respect, said the team's chef could drive his car around Turn 12, so far below the limit was he in the attempt to save electrical energy.\n\n\"Here in Bahrain, Turn 12 has historically been a very challenging corner,\" Alonso said, referring to an uphill right-hand sweep towards the end of the lap.\n\n\"You used to choose your downforce level to go Turn 12 just flat. So you remove downforce until you are in Turn 12 just flat with new tyres and then in the race. So it was a driver skill, decisive factor to go fast in a lap time.\n\n\"Now in Turn 12 we are, like, 50km/h slower because we don't want to waste energy there and we want to have it all on the straights.\n\n\"So to do Turn 12 at 200km/h instead of 260, you can drive the car, the chef can drive the car at that speed.\n\n\"So I understand Max's comments. But at the same time this is Formula 1 and it has been always like that.\n\n\"Now it is the energy, last year or two years ago, when he won all the races, it was downforce. He could go in the corners at 280km/h and we could go in the corners at 250km/h because we didn't have the downforce.\"\n\nAlonso urged caution before jumping to too many conclusions at this early stage of the new rules.\n\n\"We still love motor racing, we still love competing and for the regs I understand there is less input by the driving skills,\" he said, \"but I think after three or four races maybe we have a better idea.\"\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nJudging competitiveness in testing is always difficult because there are so many variables and teams do not reveal the specification in which they run their cars. Indeed, in many cases teams may try to deliberately fool people.\n\nBut that did not stop Red Bull's rivals noticing something striking about their new engine - it seemed able to deploy more energy for longer on a more consistent basis than other teams.\n\nAlthough Verstappen set only the seventh fastest absolute lap time of the test, Russell said Red Bull's underlying pace was \"pretty scary\".\n\nHe said that, on current evidence, Red Bull were \"going to be ahead\" at the first race, adding: \"We hope we can catch up.\"\n\nRed Bull technical director Pierre Wache rejected this analysis, saying \"clearly the top three teams - Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren - are in front of us\".\n\nRace simulations are usually the best way of judging relative pace, and there Verstappen was consistently gaining about 0.6secs a lap on Norris on the straights when they were running concurrently. Fuel loads and engine modes are not known, of course.\n\nBut the quickest race simulation of the week was done by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, who had the edge on pace over Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari when running at the same time on Friday.\n\nHamilton was matching the pace set by team-mate Charles Leclerc the day before, which was a chunk quicker than Norris was managing at the same time.\n\nThe complication here is that there may well be an element of politicking involved, because in the background there is a rumbling row about the engine rules, with Mercedes at its centre.\n\nTheir rivals believe Mercedes have found a loophole in the rules defining the engines' compression ratios. The claim is that this allows them to comply with the rule that dictates the compression ratio is measured at ambient temperature, but then run the engine on track at a higher ratio by clever exploitation of thermal expansion.\n\nFerrari, Honda, Red Bull and Audi are said to be pushing for a ruling from the FIA before the first race that would stop this.\n\nSo when Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff described Red Bull as the \"benchmark\" on the first day of the test, there were those who wondered whether he was doing so in an attempt to persuade the powers that be that a rule change before the first race was not necessary.\n\nBut perhaps Mercedes' rivals were playing this game, too. Verstappen described Wolff's remarks as \"a diversion tactic\". Leclerc said he believed Mercedes were \"hiding a lot more\".\n\nOn the competitive picture, according to Leclerc, Red Bull and Mercedes were at the front, with Ferrari a little behind, \"but it doesn't seem to be too much of a gap for now\". World champions McLaren, he said, were \"a little bit more difficult to understand\".\n\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella urged people to \"just be careful looking too much into what we see in testing. However, early indications from a competitiveness point of view, definitely put Ferrari and Mercedes at the top of the list in terms of those that seem to be ready from a performance point of view in particular\".\n\nAston Martin 'look four seconds off top teams'\n\nBehind the top four, there appears to be a gap of in the region of 1.5 to two seconds before a midfield group comprising Haas, Alpine and Audi, followed by Racing Bulls and Williams. At the back are Cadillac and Aston Martin, who are the one team being completely transparent about their performance.\n\nThere is so much attention and expectation on Aston Martin, with Alonso at the wheel, design legend Adrian Newey at the helm since March, and Honda their new works engine partner.\n\nBut the year has started badly. The car is way off the pace - around four seconds, Alonso's team-mate Lance Stroll said on Thursday.\n\nBreak that down over the lap using GPS data available to all teams, and it seems about 1.5secs of it is from the engine and the rest from the car, which performs worse the slower the corner gets.\n\nHow, one might wonder, is this possible?\n\nThe answer seems to be a combination of the car design process being behind, partly because of Newey's late arrival, partly because the team are building their own gearbox for the first time ever, and Honda being behind because… well, there is no clear answer to that one.\n\nHonda officially pulled out of F1 at the end of 2021, and dismantled much of its engine department before changing its mind in 2023. But it still had people working on upgrading its existing engine in the meantime, and its lead time for the new regulations has not been very different from Red Bull's, and yet the Japanese company seem to be nowhere in comparison.\n\nAlonso was not happy about Aston Martin's performance on Thursday, throwing his gloves down at one stage after getting out of the car. And who can blame him?\n\nThis could be his final season in F1. He is 45 in July and out of contract at the end of the year. Spending it at the back was not what he was expecting.\n\n\"Definitely we are not in the position we wanted to be,\" Alonso said, pointing out they had been late to start testing, that reliability was still not good, and that was costing them time to hone the car.\n\nThe former F1 driver Pedro de la Rosa, who has been with the team as long as Alonso and has now been appointed team representative to take some of the load off Newey, said: \"Looking back is always easy. If we had possibly started earlier, if Adrian would have been here not 2 March, but a few months earlier, if Honda wouldn't have gone and then come back - it's ifs and buts.\n\n\"Bottom line is we are slow. We're not where we want to be. Let's get a plan together. Let's look ahead, not back [at] what went wrong.\n\n\"It was many reasons. The important thing is that we we know what they are. That's what gives us the confidence that slowly, gradually, the difference will shrink.\"\n\nFastest lap times, Bahrain test one\n\n1 Kimi Antonelli (Ita) Mercedes one minute 33.669 seconds\n\n2 George Russell (GB) Mercedes 1:33.918\n\n3 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Ferrari 1:34.209\n\n4 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 1:34.273\n\n5 Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren 1:34.549\n\n6 Lando Norris (GB) McLaren 1:34.669\n\n7 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1:34.798\n\n8 Oliver Bearman (GB) Haas 1:35.349\n\n10 Franco Colapinto (Arg) Alpine 1:35.806\n\n11 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Audi 1:36.291\n\n12 Isack Hadjar (Fra) Red Bull 1:35.610\n\n13 Gabriel Bortoleto (Brz) Audi 1:36.670\n\n14 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Alpine 1:36.765\n\n15 Alex Albon (Thi) Williams 1:36.793\n\n16 Liam Lawson (NZ) Racing Bulls 1:36.808\n\n17 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Cadillac 1:36.824\n\n18 Carlos Sainz (Spa) Williams 1:37.186\n\n19 Arvid Lindblad (GB) Racing Bulls 1:37.470\n\n20 Lance Stroll (Can) Aston Martin 1:38.165\n\n21 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Aston Martin 1:38.248\n\n22 Sergio Perez (Mex) Cadillac 1:38.653\n\nF1 2026 cars in pictures at Bahrain testing\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?\n\nListen to Back at Base on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "While the cat is away the mice will play so, while some EFL clubs look to the magic of the FA Cup this weekend, their rivals will hope to steal a march by putting points on the board.\n\nMiddlesbrough and Coventry fans can spend the weekend pacing up and down waiting for their Championship showdown under the Monday night lights, but for now let us concentrate on what Saturday brings us.\n\nEd Still takes charge of Watford for the first time with the top six in view and there is a world where Millwall can push themselves into the automatic promotion conversation.\n\nLeagues One and Two present us with two first v third match-ups along with play-off pushes and relegation scraps.\n\nHere are five things which have caught our eye.\n\nWatford appointing a new head coach is not really big news. Watford having a third head coach in the same season is not really big news either. But Watford appointing Ed Still is definitely news.\n\nHaving watched his brother Will succeed on the continent but then fail with Southampton in the Championship this season, it has not deterred his older sibling from stepping into the chaotic world of Vicarage Road.\n\nThe 35-year-old's first engagement is at fellow play-off hopefuls Preston (15:00 GMT) and it is the competitive nature of the Championship which means, despite being six games without a win, victory at Deepdale could push the Hornets into the play-off places.\n\n\"It's tough, it isn't the same as European football - it's super, super, super-competitive, I think it's the most competitive league across Europe,\" Still told the BBC's 72+ EFL podcast.\n\n\"I am 100% a head coach, I am definitely not a manager - I am just a cog in Watford FC.\"\n\nThe trouble for Still is Watford like to change their cogs quite a lot and getting off to a winning start will be no easy matter at a Preston side who know a win themselves will guarantee them finishing Saturday in the top six.\n\nNow, there may well be a fair few Millwall fans who fancied they could be in the Championship play-off shake-up, but how many thought automatic promotion might be in the offing?\n\nThere is a long way to go but a win at doomed Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday (15:00 GMT) would leave them only three points behind second-placed Coventry, who have that engagement at home to the leaders Middlesbrough on Monday.\n\nMillwall have conceded only one goal in their past three outings, with last Saturday's win at promotion rivals Wrexham setting down some sort of marker.\n\nThey still have to go to Hull City, Ipswich and Middlesbrough, but first there is a trip to Hillsborough which has boss Alex Neil a little wary.\n\n\"We need to go there and attack this game and try to win it. I don't want us thinking we will walk up and score three by half-time - that's not how football works,\" he told BBC Radio London.\n\nCardiff City and Lincoln City have been setting such a furious pace at the top of League One that at times it has looked a matter of when, not if, they secure promotion.\n\nBolton Wanderers are doing their best to prevent that happening with a run of four successive wins bursting them from the pack and into contention as they prepare for a trip to second-placed Lincoln on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\n\n\"It's one of the hardest places to go in the division - but they'll know they've got a good team coming to them. I still think there'll be twists and turns,\" Bolton head coach Steven Schumacher said.\n\nBoth sides have taken 16 points from their past six matches to top the division's form guide, but the Imps hold a six-point advantage over the Trotters.\n\nDespite what Schumacher says, even at this stage, it feels like a pivotal meeting for the visitors if Lincoln are not to disappear over the hill and into the Championship.\n\nHe spent part of his eight months between management jobs working at Bristol Airport doing \"something meaningful with my time\" as a customer care assistant.\n\nPeterborough supporters will agree he has not let the grass grow under his feet since arriving at London Road in October and is \"doing something meaningful\" with a previously struggling side.\n\nWilliams has taken Posh from the bottom of League One up to eighth, within five points of the play-off places, winning five of their past nine league games (although losing four).\n\nThe side occupying the final play-off spot are Bradford City and that is where Williams takes his side on Saturday (15:00 GMT)\n\nThe Bantams are faltering with four defeats from six leaving the chasing pack snapping at their heels.\n\nThere is a lot to be said for promotion from the National League.\n\nLeague Two leaders Bromley host another recent addition to the EFL in third-placed Notts County on Saturday (15:00 GMT), but further down the division is not such a happy story.\n\nBarrow's return to the league in 2020 had a bit of romanticism and justice about it for those of a certain age.\n\nIn the days before automatic promotion, the bottom four teams of what was then Division Four had to apply for re-election and in 1972, despite finishing above two other clubs, the Bluebirds were kicked out to be replaced by Hereford.\n\nForty-eight years later Barrow were back. Leading the National League table when Covid shut down the season, they were on the right end of a vote this time to curtail the campaign and were declared champions.\n\nThere have been a couple of close squeaks as twice they just avoided a return to the non-league ranks, but also a near miss with the play-offs when they fell out of the top seven on the final day of the 2023-24 season.\n\nThis year is looking bleak with boss Paul Gallagher sacked on Wednesday after losing all five games of his six-week tenure and being replaced by Dino Maamria - their sixth permanent boss in fewer than four years.\n\nIt leaves Barrow three points clear of trouble with play-off hopefuls Colchester United dropping by on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\n\nAfter that comes a meeting with bottom side Harrogate and the final day has a home game against a Newport side that are second from bottom - Barrow will not want their struggles getting that far.\n\nIt has been 22 years since Cumbria was last without an EFL club, Maamria will need to get busy quickly if that is not to become a possibility again.\n\nBBC Sport will have live text coverage of Saturday's EFL action.",

    "fullText": "\"Yet another bizarre appointment by the chairman.\"\n\n\"I don't get it... why not go for someone with a proven track record in the Championship?\"\n\n\"I cannot believe we are doing this again... a complete nobody with no experience in English football.\"\n\nHull City's decision to appoint Sergej Jakirovic as their new head coach in June last year was not met with much, or indeed any, enthusiasm from a number of fans.\n\nThe Tigers had just avoided relegation to League One on goal difference, one season after now Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior was sacked for only managing a seventh-placed finish.\n\nYet many were still surprised Ruben Selles was fired after keeping them up.\n\nHowever, Jakirovic and Hull have confounded expectations to sit just five points off the top two in the Championship.\n\nAs the former Bosnia international prepares to welcome Chelsea for a FA Cup fourth-round tie, how did the much-travelled 49-year-old end up leading an unexpected promotion charge in East Yorkshire?\n\n\"With a towering stature and steely gaze that could burn a hole through concrete, Sergej Jakirovic walked into the media suite at Hull City's MKM Stadium last summer and immediately commanded the attention of everyone in attendance,\" BBC Radio Humberside's Hull City reporter Mike White said.\n\n\"Based on that first impression, you'd be forgiven for thinking he was going to be a tough nut to crack for those of us in the media who'd be dealing with him all the time.\n\n\"However, it didn't take long for us to realise that first impressions aren't always the best way to judge someone.\n\n\"He's personable with an engaging sense of humour, intelligent, passionate and always forthright in his views.\"\n\nIt took a while for Jakirovic to made those first impressions count on the pitch as City made a mixed start to the season, with two wins, three draws and three losses in their opening eight league matches.\n\nA good run through October and November propelled them up the table but it was a 4-1 home reverse by Middlesbrough that built the platform for their move into promotion contention.\n\nAfter that defeat by Boro, Hull had conceded 34 goals from 19 games, the second-worst defensive record in the league.\n\nSince then they have let in just nine goals from their subsequent 12 games, with eight wins and six clean sheets in that run.\n\nThe Tigers are averaging 45% possession compared to 49% last season and making an average of 276 successful passes per game, 70 fewer than last time out.\n\nUnder Tim Walter and Selles last season the side scored two goals from what football statisticians Opta define as fast breaks - this season it's already nine.\n\nExperienced striker Oli McBurnie, who has scored 12 goals in 22 league appearances this season, said that the team are benefitting from the trust the manager and staff have in the players.\n\n\"It's not been like a dictatorship. Since they've come in they've understood what English football and culture is about,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"They will have a conversation with you. Obviously, the gaffer has the final decision but they've been brilliant.\n\n\"They understand the league and understand that we know the league and our opinions matter and having Dean [Holden] on the staff is massive for them.\"\n\nFriday, 13 February - 19:45 GMT\n\nWatch on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website and app; listen on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Humberside\n\nWhite agrees that Jakirovic's work has been built on solid foundations with sporting director Jared Dublin and head of recruitment Martin Hodge.\n\nHowever, against a backdrop of a lengthy injury list that at one point saw Jakirovic say he had 11 fit senior players, he believes the manager deserves \"a tremendous amount of credit\".\n\n\"It should be said that going into this season little was expected of a team working under a two-window EFL transfer restriction - only free signings and loans without fees were permitted - but the quality of recruitment has been nothing short of remarkable,\" said White.\n\n\"Adding to their challenges have been one serious injury after another to some of their key players like Oli McBurnie, John Lundstram, Joe Gelhardt and Mo Belloumi - a list that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the full injury crisis the club has found itself in consistently.\n\n\"Yet still they plough on, with a shot at the top two still a very real possibility - particularly given Coventry's recent downturn in form - so a return to the Premier League after nine years away shouldn't be ruled out.\n\n\"And Jakirovic deserves a tremendous amount of credit for steering it all in the right direction.\"\n\nJakirovic was born in to a football family in Mostar, then part of Yugoslavia, in December 1976.\n\nHis father Enver played as a goalkeeper for NK Neretva in modern-day Croatia and it was there that the Tigers boss began his own playing career.\n\nAcross 20 years he played as a defensive midfielder in Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Austria and also won five caps for Bosnia.\n\nA third generation of the family is now looking to make their way in the game - he gave a professional debut to his son Leon at Dinamo Zagreb when the latter was just 16 in May 2024.\n\nThe teenager moved on to Italian super club Inter Milan last month.\n\nAfter hanging up his boots, Jakirovic started his senior coaching career at Croatian second division side Sesvete in 2017 and then moved on to top tier side Gorica the following year.\n\nA brief spell with Slovenian champions Maribor followed before he guided Bosnian outfit Zrinjski Mostar to the title in 2021-22.\n\nHe returned to Croatia to take over at Rijeka in November 2022 but quit to replace former Liverpool midfielder Igor Biscan at Dinamo Zagreb in August 2023 and won the Croatian double that season.\n\nHowever, after becoming the first team to concede nine goals in a Champions League game, when they were demolished 9-2 by Bayern Munich, Jakirovic left in September 2024.\n\nTurkish strugglers Kayserispor appointed him as their boss in January last year and he led them away from relegation danger before making the move to England.\n\n\"When you look at Sergej's career he was successful everywhere he went,\" owner Acun Ilicali told BBC Radio Humberside in the summer after making Jakirovic his fifth boss since taking over in January 2022.\n\n\"He played the football at Kayserispor that I want to see my team play.\n\n\"When you look at his career he has the talent to make all his teams play similar games.\"\n\nDespite the early scepticism, it looks like this \"bizarre appointment\" could just be the perfect one.\n\nLatest Hull City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Hull City content on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains the key things a manager can do before, during and after matches to get the results they want.",
    "fullText": "I've talked a lot in this column about all the different work a manager does in trying to build everything you need in place at a club to be successful, but this week I want to talk about what happens around a game itself - before, during and afterwards.\n\nFor me, preparation for any game always started two hours after the one I had just managed.\n\nMy drive home to the south coast on a Saturday night after a game could take three hours or more, and much of that would be spent on the phone while I had precious quiet time.\n\nWhen I was at Stoke City, my chairman Peter Coates would always speak to me then if we lost. If we'd won, he never bothered, knowing I wouldn't need comforting.\n\nWin or lose, however, I would always ring my assistants, David Kemp and Gerry Francis, and we would discuss the game in finer detail - away from the stadium to give us a different perspective.\n\nThen I would contact my chief scout, who would have been at our next opponent's game, for a quick run-down of what he had seen - their shape, patterns, strength, weaknesses and any injuries.\n\nSunday was about spending all day with the family, but then either late on Sunday night or early on Monday morning I would be back up the motorway, with a clear view of what I believed was needed for our next game.\n\nThe players' week is always scheduled around the next game too. Monday was a light training session with the players who played on Saturday, and a debrief in a match-related game versus the reserves.\n\nThroughout my managerial career, I always wanted to show people I worked with what I wanted, and we would go through positives and negatives from Saturday live on the pitch.\n\nIf they needed it clarified then, whatever it was, it was sorted out in a game-related session on the grass. The players who hadn't started on Saturday stayed out afterwards, and had a much tougher morning.\n\nThis kind of work was always vital to me for us to get things right the following Saturday. Whether it was at Stoke, Crystal Palace or West Brom, I always recognised each team's strengths, and we all needed to be aware of the team's identity.\n\nYes, at each of those clubs we took different routes to get to our objective, but the aims - and challenges - were the same.\n\nHaving that clear identity and also a system that suits your players is paramount to success, but as a manager you also have to be confident and brave in leading and directing your strong personal views.\n\nPlayers will always test you, but will respect clarity and leadership if it stands firm under pressure. The reason I am mentioning this now, in respect to game days, is because it matters the most then.\n\nThe best example I can give is in the week before games against the very top teams I went overboard trying to exude confidence in my team and my tactics.\n\nIt didn't always work, but I believed that if they felt that from me, it would help them come the big day.\n\nAfter a full week of working on every player - drilling into each individual the understanding of their role in the team and how it would affect everything if he did not carry it off - I would then set about the ways we could hurt the opposition.\n\nObviously set-plays have now become a byword for how teams can do that successfully, but that was the case before me and it is the same now I have retired.\n\nAs well as attacking set-plays, defending them was something else we would work on. Whether it was in attack or defence, every individual knew his own personal challenge.\n\nOn the Saturday, I would turn up for a home game at about 11am, and in my early years I would also train myself before games.\n\nAt this stage, with only a few hours to go until kick-off, I would run through everything again and wait until the lads started to arrive. Once they were all settled, I would have a quick chat - nothing too rousing! - and then leave the dressing room.\n\nOnce the opposition teamsheet arrived, about 75 minutes before kick-off, I would check our markers against their players - this was important because I always man-marked!\n\nI would take that board into our dressing room, and out I would go again, until they arrived back from their warm-ups. Everything said from then on until the players left to start the game was confidence filling, with no negatives at all.\n\nThe actual team talk itself and the last things you said to the players could be very different depending on the occasion. It was not always me who gave it, either.\n\nAgain at Stoke, I got Ricardo Fuller up to speak right before our FA Cup semi-final against Bolton at Wembley in 2011.\n\nRic was such a great character and also a player with exceptional ability. Unfortunately he was injured and out of the game but he delivered a once-in-a-lifetime speech to the team, quoting Nelson Mandela.\n\nWe won the game 5-0 and to this day I am sure Ric believes his speech drove the lads to that famous result. The players would all tell you it certainly got them going.\n\nIt just shows you that the way to succeed in football management is not set in stone. You need tremendous resilience, yes, but also many more human strings to your bow.\n\nIn my early years at Stoke, we were always the underdogs, and the atmosphere was off the charts, never mind who we played.\n\nAs time went by and we became established, teams coming to Stoke were much more prepared for the experience, and our supporters became less reliant on our underdog status and rightly so.\n\nTo make up for this I began to use more psychological methods to generate the atmosphere in the dressing room that would help motivate the players.\n\nThat might mean mentioning recent comments or coverage that was negative towards us, or even bringing up stuff I had remembered from our early days at the club - anything that criticised us in any shape of form, that I knew would generate a positive response from the lads.\n\nThis method helped us greatly going into games we were expected to win.\n\nWhat you say at half-time is important too.\n\nI would always get two or three main points over about how the match was going, but you have to be careful what you say and do because the break can dramatically change the whole flow of the game.\n\nI've watched my team be really on it in the first half, then completely lose control of the game inside the first five minutes of the second half - and vice versa.\n\nIt's something all managers and coaches must be wary of, and I certainly was.\n\nI often tell the story of how Stoke were once 2-0 up at Blackburn at half-time and, as they were walking off the pitch, I just got a feeling a bit of complacency was setting in with our lads, who were patting each other on the back.\n\nSo, I decided to liven the dressing room up and picked on my captain Ryan Shawcross, who - by the way - had been absolutely outstanding that half. I gave him both barrels, and that left everyone extremely shocked.\n\nThe second half came and went with us seeing the game out and getting a deserved victory, but Ryan came to see me on the Monday - he was still pretty upset and did not know what had happened.\n\nI explained my reasons - I knew Blackburn boss Sam Allardyce would be after a big response from his lads in the second half, so to compensate for that I had to put everyone on edge.\n\nIt worked but, trust me, that was not always the case.\n\nAs a manager, you can obviously change things when the game is going on too.\n\nWhen I started in management, there was only one substitute permitted, but today you can change five players.\n\nThat's half of the outfield team that have started the game so, with squads so large now too, then it certainly can be a massive help to the coach.\n\nI look at the top teams' benches now and sometimes I can't believe the quality on there, which is something else that has changed in the past 30 years.\n\nMaking changes is always a pre-meditated option. Yes, I have taken players off for playing poorly, because we needed to hold on to a lead or were desperately trying to claw a goal back, but most of the time you have still got a plan.\n\nAs I've mentioned before when I talked about scouting players, the game has moved on to such an extent in the past 30 years that computers play a big part now in providing you with information.\n\nIt is the same during today's games too, to the extent computers on the side of the pitch can release certain data that can have an effect on a manager's thinking, either around individuals for substitutions or overall team analysis.\n\nI always trusted my own eyes, though. Although I have seen some fantastic advancements made with team analysis and individuals' live game data, I always backed my experience and judgement.\n\nOf course those decisions can have a huge impact if you get them right. I listen now to some commentators drooling over substitutions that change games, and what a genius the manager was to make those changes.\n\nWell, I have had those plaudits myself but, if the truth be known, I had picked the wrong XI to start with.\n\nIf I really was such a genius, I would have started with a different XI and got it right at the beginning.\n\nImmediately after full-time, I was always quick to move on, whatever the result.\n\nI would always explain to the players on Monday if I needed to get things off my chest about their performances.\n\nIt is always the manager who gets more of a grilling at full-time - many questions always followed the end of each Premier League fixture, with the agenda driven by the result.\n\nAs a manager, you are thrust almost immediately into the jaws of our unforgiving media and questions about tactics, substitutions and your team's overall performance are fired at you, sometimes under severe pressure.\n\nObviously the more damning investigations are aimed at the losing team's manager, where it is more than likely the questions are preordained.\n\nFor the winner, there are plaudits - but whatever the outcome, you have to think forwards not back.\n\nI was soon back in my car and heading home... thinking about the next match.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Daffy Duck and Porky Pig - and AI - with his predictions for all 16 FA Cup fourth-round ties.",
    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has a couple of very special guests for the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nHe is joined by Looney Tunes duo Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, the stars of new film 'The Day The Earth Blew Up', to make predictions for all 16 ties.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can see what AI thinks and choose your winner from each tie, below.\n\nDaffy and Porky were first drawn in the 1930s and the actor who initially voiced Porky had a stammer, and therefore so did the character.\n\nHi Daffy and hello Porky. This weekend it's the FA Cup - a historic competition famous for upsets and under-dogs - or is it under-ducks? - where the top Premier League teams sometimes lose to part-time sides. Are you excited about it!?\n\nDaffy: Are you kidding? I'm tho exthited. It'th incredible. Thtupendous! And the only thing that could make me more exthited is if I knew what the heck it was!\n\nPorky: I love sp-sp-sp-all kinds of athletic competition but I mostly play b-baseball and basketball, so I just hope the best team wins.\n\nThe FA Cup started in 1871 so it's even older than both of you... could we trust the pair of you if we gave you the job of looking after the famous old trophy together?\n\nDaffy: But of courth - there's no one more truthtworthy than me - and to prove it I'll take your cup far far far over yonder for thafe-keeping...\n\nPorky: Daffy, that's not the trophy that's a t-t-ttea cup. The British love drinking tea.\n\nDaffy: Oh. Wise guys, huh? Wathting my time!\n\nYou both have to save the world in 'The Day The Earth Blew Up' but this is an even bigger challenge - can you get better of our pundit and football expert Chris Sutton at predictions by picking the right scores? How confident are both of you about beating him?\n\nDaffy: You want a prediction? My prediction is we will dethtroy him! Annihilate him! Crush him! Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: He he, now d-don't get carried away, Daffy. Nothing wrong with a little friendly competition, but it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you p-p-play the game. All that matters is that we all have fu-fu-fu-fu... a good time!\n\nDaffy, you asked for Michael Jordan's autograph in Space Jam, would you want Chris' autograph? He won the Premier League in 1995... but he can be a bit of a know-it-all and even a little boastful at times, a bit like Foghorn Leghorn. Are you impressed, and what would you tell him if you met him?\n\nDaffy: As a perthon of great refinement, delicathy and modethty, I have no time for boathtful people. They're dethpicable. I find the best way to deal with them ith to whack 'em over the head with a plank. Do you have any plankth I could use?\n\nPorky, you have to deal with Daffy's short fuse and madcap ideas... how would you feel about having Chris as a sidekick instead? Would you be as loyal to him as you are to Daffy?\n\nPorky: Well, I pp-pride myself on being lo-lo-lo—faithful... but I would consider having a less Daffy and messy housemate!\n\nYou've both played basketball with the rest of the Tune Squad in the Space Jam movies, would you fancy a go at soccer (or football as we call it in the UK)?\n\nDaffy: I helped defeat a team of alien 'Monstars'. It really wouldn't be fair to your little thoccer teams to take on thuch a thupreme athlete as mythelf.\n\nPorky: I think I'd p-p-prefer to be the referee. I like the whistle.\n\nMaybe both of you would be better as managers - together as a double-act to make the big decisions? Some managers are loyal and optimistic like Porky... some are more desperate for attention, like Daffy?\n\nDaffy: With my unique combination of thkill and thrategy I think I could be a great player and a coach. At the thame time. And thell the refreshments and merchandithe. I thee it now - Daffy Thtadium - home of Daffy United!\n\nPorky: I've been a successful t-t-talent agent, so I think I would make a good ma-ma-ma-ma- head coach. I've been learning the offside rule. Let me read b-b-back my notes. \"If a player scores a g-g-goal and you don't want it to count, that's offside.\"\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\n4th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior is really well thought of by Hull fans from his time in charge there, and he is a former Tigers player as well.\n\nSo, he should get a great reception there on Friday night, but what he really needs is a win - especially after letting a two-goal lead slip against Leeds on Tuesday.\n\nRosenior has had some great results with Chelsea but it seems some fans aren't convinced by him. He will be desperate to prove them wrong by winning a trophy and the FA Cup is a great opportunity for him to do that this season.\n\nHull are going well in the Championship under Sergej Jakirovic but I just see Chelsea being too strong for them.\n\nI scored for Chelsea against Hull in the FA Cup, many years ago. We won 6-1 that day and Chelsea are going to win comfortably this time too.\n\nDaffy: Should be a hulluva a game. Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: I guess Chelsea will have to g-g-go to Hull and back.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n6th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\n\nBoth teams are in the thick of the promotion race, and they meet again in Wales in the league next weekend.\n\nWith that in mind, I just wonder whether Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna will be the one to change things up here.\n\nI hope he doesn't but I think he might, because his side are in reach of the automatic spots, and that would be Wrexham's chance.\n\nEven so, I think this will be close. I'd normally just tip Ipswich to lose anyway but this prediction is for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who is a big fan and will be delighted that I am backing them.\n\nAs for moneybags Wrexham, well I don't think their Hollywood stardust will help to take them to Wembley, but after this they will be able to focus on their play-off bid.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Ipswich win on penalties\n\nDaffy: Ipswich Town wrecks'em? Well they should be more careful with their Tractorth!\n\nPorky: I think we have to say Hooray for Ho-Holl-holl-holl-Tinseltown and go with Wrexham.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n22nd in League One v 18th in Premier League\n\nBurton are struggling in League One, with only one win in their past nine league games, but they have scored 14 goals in their three FA Cup wins to get this far, and I can see them scoring again at home here.\n\nI don't think we will see a shock, though. West Ham look like they have turned a bit of a corner, and they will be gutted to have conceded an equaliser so late on against Manchester United on Tuesday.\n\nHammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo won't want to lose the momentum that they've built in the past few weeks so, while he might make a couple of changes, he will still pick a team strong enough to get through.\n\nDaffy, when told that West Ham's famous song is 'we're forever blowing bubbles': No thir, no bubbleth, no way. Not after we went through with the zombie bubble gum. I'm going with Burton Albion (whatever that means).\n\nPorky: Yes, I don't want to b-b-b-bur- pop anyone's balloon, but I agree with Daffy. Bub-bub-bubbles can be tough to b-b-beat though. I think it will be tight.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 2-1\n\n19th in Premier League v 12th in League One\n\nAs I said on the Monday Night Club, I feel like some Burnley fans are forgetting how difficult it is for any promoted team in the Premier League. They look at how Sunderland and Leeds are doing, and think 'why not us?'\n\nClarets boss Scott Parker is taking a lot of flak at the moment, so he really needed Wednesday's win over Crystal Palace. That was a great result but he cannot afford to follow it by slipping up at home to a mid-table League One side.\n\nI am not expecting that to happen here - Burnley were up against an in-form Millwall side in round three and brushed them aside.\n\nBut I do think we will see some goals and some entertainment - there has not been much of either at Turf Moor this season. Mansfield beat Sheffield United 4-3 in the last round, and I can see them going out all guns blazing.\n\nDaffy: I think you're jutht making teamth up now.\n\nPorky: I'll support b-b-b-b-b-oh forget it - Mansfield.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n2nd in Premier League v 6th in League Two\n\nManchester City beat Salford City 8-0 in last season's FA Cup and the only thing I am not sure about here is how many they will score this time.\n\nSalford are doing well in League Two and I like their manager, Karl Robinson, but they are going to be outclassed.\n\nDaffy: I've heard of Manchethter... which is more than I can say for the otherth.\n\nPorky: Th-th-th-that's good enough for me!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-0\n\n16th in Championship v 19th in Championship\n\nThis prediction is not quite as straightforward as just looking at recent form. West Brom are really struggling while Norwich are flying - and beat the Baggies 5-0 on 20 January - but my old club have got so many injuries at the moment.\n\nI am still going to back Norwich here though. Philippe Clement has got the team playing really well and it was great to see Mohamed Toure hit a hat-trick on his first start for the club, against Oxford on Tuesday.\n\nClement says they showed Toure images of Erling Haaland beforehand to show how he creates space for himself, and Romelu Lukaku to see how he uses his body.\n\nI'm sure someone at Carrow Road could dig out some old VHS tapes of me in action for the Canaries if Toure needs any more inspiration. Although finding a video to play them on might be tricky.\n\nDaffy, when told Norwich are Chris Sutton's old team: You keep talking about thith Crith Thutton like I'm thupposed to care about him. Jutht for that I'm picking the Women's Basketball Association.\n\nPorky: No, Daffy it says here that WBA is West Bromwich Albion.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. What about Eatht Bromwich and North Bromwich, and Thouth Bromwich. That'th a lot of Bromwich!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-2\n\n24th in League One v 8th in Championship\n\nPort Vale are toiling at the bottom of League One. Bristol City have been a bit erratic too, but they are still only a point off the Championship play-off places.\n\nCity have got a huge game coming up at Wrexham on Tuesday, which might be a bit of a distraction for this tie, but I still see them reaching round five.\n\nDaffy: Doeth everyone in thith country have their own team? How many more are there?\n\nPorky: B-B-Bristol sounds like bristle. And pigs have bristles so...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2\n\n9th in Championship v 21st in Championship\n\nIt was absolutely unbelievable what happened when these two teams met in the league on Tuesday. Leicester were 3-0 up at half-time, but ended up losing 4-3 in the 97th minute.\n\nHow do the Foxes come back from that? I don't think they will. They will be angry, and are bound to be fired up, but you just wonder what damage it has done to their confidence and morale.\n\nLeicester had a points deduction last week which left them in big trouble at the bottom of the table and they don't have a manager at the moment - Andy King is caretaker boss and at half-time you can just imagine how he feels too.\n\nSouthampton are one of the form teams in the division, with four wins in their past five games, and I don't see Leicester getting any revenge here.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. Thouthhampton or Lie-theth-ter...\n\nPorky: It's pr-pr-pronounced \"Lester\"\n\nDaffy: What is wrong with you people? Can't you thpell?? In that cathe...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n3rd in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI was delighted for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe that his team beat Tottenham and also the reception he got from his side's fans afterwards.\n\nFor everything he has done for them, the world must have gone bonkers for their fans to be calling up 606 and saying they wanted him out.\n\nThis will be a very different test to playing Spurs, however, and I am going with my gut feeling on this one.\n\nThe two sides met recently when Villa won at St James' Park at the end of January and although Villa have slipped up a couple of times at home recently, when it clicks for them, they usually end up winning.\n\nDaffy, when told Newcastle are known as the 'Toon' by their fans, who are 'The Toon Army': You had me at Toon! Though I do like the thound of thtaying in a nithe villa.\n\nPorky: Remember Space Jam? No one can beat toons!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2 (And th-th-th-that's gonna be all folks!)\n\n6th in Premier League v 14th in Premier League\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler are both under pressure but it feels like Hurzeler has the bigger problems to solve.\n\nBrighton are on a poor run and apparently it all got a bit ugly at their home defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday. The fans seem to have lost faith in him, and although that feels harsh to me, when it happens then it it is hard to reverse it.\n\nThe Seagulls beat Manchester United away in round three and now Hurzeler could really do with beating Liverpool away too.\n\nI wouldn't put it past them, either, especially with Liverpool struggling to see out games at the moment, but I think Slot's side will just about get over the line.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Liverpool to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Liverpool, home of The Beatleth - finally thomewhere I've heard of!\n\nPorky: Someone told me, \"if you don't know anything about foo-foo-foo-soccer, just say you support Liverpool.\"\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 4-1\n\n10th in Championship v 15th in Premier League\n\nLeeds' comeback from 2-0 down to draw at Chelsea was just extraordinary, but I can smell an upset here.\n\nI am sure Leeds boss Daniel Farke will make some changes because he will have at least half an eye on the Premier League, and their next game against Aston Villa.\n\nBirmingham are going well under Chris Davies and are unbeaten in eight games in all competitions. This seems like a good time for him to take a top-flight scalp.\n\nDaffy: I didn't know a team from Alabama could play here.\n\nPorky: I don't think it's the same one.\n\nDaffy: Birmingham all the way - woohoo!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 100-0\n\n12th in League Two v 20th in Premier League\n\nI know all about Grimsby because I was at Blundell Park for their Carabao Cup win over Manchester United earlier in the season.\n\nCould something similar happen again? Yes, definitely. There will be another cracking atmosphere and David Artell and his players will fancy another upset, I am sure of that.\n\nThis is a horrible game for Wolves, but it is an important one for their manager Rob Edwards. He needs to find a way of getting through this tie, which is something Ruben Amorim could not do with United.\n\nWolves have had a miserable season and they probably thought it couldn't get any worse - well it might.\n\nI think lightning might strike twice, and this game will end in a draw before Grimsby win the shootout, just like they did against Manchester United.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Grimsby to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Grimthby eh? Thounds grim and deprething. I'll go with the Wolves.\n\nPorky: I think they'll huff and puff and run out steam. At least I hope so.\n\n23rd in Championship v 11th in Premier League\n\nBoth of these teams got through the last round on penalties, with Oxford beating MK Dons and Sunderland overcoming Everton.\n\nI don't see Sunderland needing a shootout this time, though. Oxford are pretty woeful at the moment and have just been spanked by Norwich - they are not coming back from that.\n\nRegis le Bris will make changes but the Black Cats will still be far too strong.\n\nDaffy, when told that Sunderland are nicknamed the Black Cats - so would not get on with Tweety Pie: Birdth of a feather mutht stick together against catth!\n\nPorky: And Oxford is a place of higher ed-ed-edu-learning. So I think they'll outsmart the opposition.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n14th in Championship v 12th in Premier League\n\nStoke's boss is my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins, who is an excellent manager - he clearly learnt a lot from me - but I fancy Fulham here.\n\nI don't know what Marco Silva's situation is with Fulham and if he is leaving at the end of the season, but he will want to go out with a bang.\n\nI really like the way Silva's side play, and I wouldn't rule out the Cottagers' chances of going deep in the FA Cup this season.\n\nDaffy: I think I know which one Porky liketh here.\n\nPorky: A f-f-f-full ham? You bet!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\n1st in Premier League v 21st in League One\n\nThis is the first meeting between these two clubs since the 2014 FA Cup semi-final, when Arsenal won on penalties and Mikel Arteta scored in a shootout. The Gunners went on to beat Hull in the final.\n\nThings have changed a lot for Wigan since then, and not in a good way.\n\nThey have just sacked their manager Ryan Lowe after sliding into the League One relegation zone, and it's hard to see them forcing a shootout this time, no matter how many changes Arteta makes.\n\nArsenal have not had much joy in the FA Cup since Arteta won it again as manager in 2019-20, a few months after taking charge.\n\nThey have not been past round four since, but they are going to make it to the last 16 this time, I'm sure of it.\n\nIn fact, they have got so much strength in depth now that, while for years Arteta has not been able to win anything at all, he could feasibly win four trophies this season.\n\nIs the Quadruple on? That could be the question we are asking in the final few months of the season.\n\nDaffy: You thee, the problem with Arthenal is they just try to walk it in.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n6th in National League North v 7th in Premier League\n\nI am co-commentating on this game for 5 Live with Ali Bruce-Ball and I cannot wait.\n\nMacclesfield boss John Rooney did an incredible job with his side's historic win over Crystal Palace in round three.\n\nI watched the game back as part of my prep and, while the Silkmen had less than 29% possession, they limited Palace to very few chances and they were deserved winners.\n\nKnocking the holders out was rightly hailed as the biggest shock in the FA Cup's illustrious history, and it would be another fantastic feat if they toppled Brentford too.\n\nOnly one non-league side has ever beaten two top-flight teams in the same FA Cup campaign - Millwall in 1913-14, who overcame Chelsea and Bradford City.\n\nI'd love to think Macclesfield could do it too, and if they play like they did against Palace then they have a great chance, especially on their plastic pitch.\n\nI think Brentford will be ready for them, though, and Keith Andrews' side are having a tremendous season too.\n\nAndrews will know he can't make too many changes here, and maybe Brentford will go on an FA Cup run themselves - they have not reached the quarter-finals since 1989, so it it is long overdue.\n\nThis is going to be a tight game but I just have a feeling the Bees will edge it.\n\nDaffy: I don't underthtand thith game at all – what is a Maccle? Why are there fields of them? And why do you altho call them the Thilkmen? Jutht for that, I'm going with Brentford!\n\nPorky: B-b-Bees make honey, And honey is sweet... and so is my d-d-dear-d-d-arling Petunia.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. Porky Pig and Daffy Duck's answers are as told to Dan Berlinka.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat.

    "fullText": "All eyes for Northern Ireland are firmly on preparations for the upcoming World Cup play-off against Italy, but players and fans alike will be interested in Thursday's Uefa Nations League draw to see who they will face later in the year.\n\nNorthern Ireland will compete in League B of the fifth edition of the Nations League after they won promotion from League C in 2024.\n\nThe latest edition of the competition will start during the newly expanded four-game international window in September and October later this year and run until June 2027.\n\nBefore Thursday's draw, BBC Sport NI takes a look at Northern Ireland's potential opponents.\n\nHow does the Nations League work and when is the draw?\n\nThe draw will take place at the Brussels Expo in Belgium and is set to get under way at 17:00 GMT on Thursday.\n\nYou can follow the draw on the BBC Sport website with live text updates and reaction.\n\nNorthern Ireland are in pot four for the draw along with the Sweden, North Macedonia and Kosovo, who also won promotion from League C.\n\nThose four teams will face one side from the other three pots.\n\nPot 1: Scotland, Hungary, Poland and Israel\n\nPot 2: Switzerland, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Austria and Ukraine\n\nPot 3: Slovenia, Georgia, Republic of Ireland and Romania\n\nFrom Pot 1, Northern Ireland could take on Scotland, who will compete at their first World Cup since 1990 this summer.\n\nMichael O'Neill's side enjoyed a 1-0 victory over the Scots when the two sides met in a friendly at Hampden in March 2024, courtesy of Conor Bradley's first international goal.\n\nAlternatively, they could come up against Hungary, who missed out on reaching the World Cup play-offs following Troy Parrott's last-gasp winner for Republic of Ireland in November.\n\nThe two sides were previously paired together in the Euro 2016 qualification campaign, with Northern Ireland winning 2-1 away and the home game ending in a 1-1 draw.\n\nPoland and Israel are the remaining two potential opponents in Pot 1 and it has been a while since NI played either of the two teams.\n\nO'Neill's side were beaten 1-0 by the Poles in their opening Euro 2016 group game while they defeated Israel 3-0 in an international friendly in September 2018.\n\nFrom Pot 2, NI could face familiar foes Switzerland, who denied them a place at the 2018 World Cup and will be at the tournament in USA, Mexico and Canada this summer.\n\nIsaac Price scored a stunning free-kick in a 1-1 draw against the Swiss at Windsor Park in March last year.\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina are another potential opponent and NI could come up against them in the World Cup play-off final too if they see off Italy and Bosnia beat Wales in their semi-final.\n\nThey could also be drawn against either World Cup-bound Austria or Ukraine.\n\nNorthern Ireland have lost their last five games against Austria while they have not faced Ukraine, who are also in the World Cup play-offs, since their glorious 2-0 win in Lyon in the Euro 2016 group stage.\n\nFrom Pot 3, NI could come up against Slovenia, who won home and away against O'Neill's side in Euro 2024 qualifying.\n\nThey could also face Euro 2024 surprise packing Georgia for the first time in a competitive game. The two sides have only ever met once, in a friendly in March 2008 which NI won 4-1.\n\nA potential intriguing match-up is Northern Ireland being drawn in the same group as Republic of Ireland, who will also compete in next month's World Cup play-offs.\n\nThere have been just two meetings between the teams since the turn of the century.\n\nThe Republic won 5-0 in the now-defunct Nations Cup in 2011 and the two teams then played out a goalless draw in a 2018 friendly, with both games taking place in Dublin.\n\nNorthern Ireland have not faced the Republic of Ireland in Belfast since 1994.\n\nRounding off potential Pot 3 opponents are Romania, who also have hopes of featuring in this summer's World Cup as they take on Turkey in their play-off semi-final next month.\n\nNI have won just three of the nine meetings between the sides, with the last four ending in draws.\n\nThere are four groups containing four teams in Leagues A, B and C and two groups of three teams in League D.\n\nThe winners and runners-up in the four League A groups will go through to the quarter-final stage of the tournament to play over two legs in March 2027, with semi-finals and finals in June 2027.\n\nThere are also play-offs for promotion and relegation from leagues A-C at the same time in March 2027.\n\nThe best-performing teams in the Nations League that do not qualify for the 2028 European Championships from the qualification campaign will enter to play-offs to earn the final qualifying spots for the tournament.\n\nTopping Group C3 in 2024 gave Northern Ireland a backdoor route to the play-offs for the World Cup and doing well in League B could offer a similar passage to Euro 2028 if O'Neill's side do not qualify automatically.\n\nMatchday 3: 30 September-3 October\n\nLeague A quarter-finals: 25-30 March 2027\n\nLeague A/B and B/C play-offs: 25-30 March 2027\n\nFinal tournament: 9-13 June 2027\n\nLeague C/D play-offs: 23-28 March 2028",

    "description": "BBC Scotland examines the lie of the land in the Scottish Premiership title race.",
    "fullText": "On a cold Tuesday evening, with 87 minutes of the Edinburgh derby gone, it seemed the Scottish Premiership title momentum was about to jolt towards Glasgow.\n\nBut then Tomas Magnusson popped up in the Hibernian box to knock in a late winner for leaders Hearts. As Tynecastle rocked, the reverberations were felt far west.\n\nThe Gorgie side has restored their advantage to a full six points before their title rivals played. The standard had been set. Keep up if you can.\n\nTime for Wednesday, when Celtic hosted Livingston and Rangers headed to mighty Motherwell, who sit on the top three's coattails in fourth, at Fir Park.\n\nIf you thought Tuesday was dramatic, Wednesday certainly did not disappoint.\n\nWith 90 minutes played at Parkhead, there was a shock on the cards. Livingston, a side without a win in 23 games and who've just changed manager, were about to hold Celtic to a draw.\n\nUp stepped Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, curling in a winner from the edge of the box, on his Celtic debut. His first goal in any game of football for 14 months, and the first time he'd stepped on a pitch since May 2025.\n\nCeltic remain third, but are now a point behind Rangers and within six of Hearts, with a game in hand over both.\n\nOver in North Lanarkshire, it seemed more simple for Rangers. A goal to the good thanks to Nico Raskin's early strike, they also had a man advantage after Lukas Fadinger's red card.\n\nIt seemed they had answered the challenge laid down to them by Hearts, only for Motherwell defender Stephen Welsh to lash home a late equaliser that Danny Rohl's side could not respond to.\n\nRemember, this is on-loan Stephen Welsh who made two appearances for Celtic in January after being recalled, only to rejoin Motherwell on deadline day.\n\n\"Just when there's a twist of fate at Celtic Park a few minutes ago, it's a Celtic player who then comes up with huge goal for Motherwell,\" pundit Stephen Craigan said.\n\n\"Another chapter in what is proving to be the best season we've seen in such a long time,\" was ex-Hearts midfielder Michael Stewart's analysis on Sportsound.\n\nFrom a huge game on Wednesday, to an even bigger one on Sunday afternoon. First travels to second when Hearts go to Ibrox to face Rangers.\n\nDerek McInnes' side won there earlier in the season, for the first time since 2014. They beat Rangers at Tynecastle, too, in a 2-1 win in December.\n\nBut, Rohl's men haven't lost since then. In fact, they've drawn twice and won seven. It's resurgent form that looks a world away from a team which were once 13 points adrift in the title race under Russell Martin.\n\n\"I think it is a pretty good point [against Motherwell] but as Danny Rohl mentioned, there's a massive game on Sunday [against Hearts] and that starts to look like a must-win,\" said former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson.\n\nCeltic will be looking on, crossing their fingers and wishing for a draw.\n\nThey'll be fresh off the back of a game against Kilmarnock down at Rugby Park. The last time they were, they won thanks to a late Kelechi Iheanacho penalty.\n\nThey'll need a better performance than the one against Livingston. Although they peppered the visitors' goal with shots, the lack of cutting edge will be a worry.\n\n\"Celtic were running out of ideas, very predictable, just playing it across, hoping rather than making it happen, and they just got away with it right at the end,\" said former keeper Pat Bonner.\n\n\"What a huge three points it is for Celtic. They'll be relieved.\"\n\nIt was another sterling performance from Motherwell, adding to a catalogue of fine showings this season.\n\nAgainst the top three, they have two draws with Hearts, two draws and a loss against Rangers, and a win and loss to Celtic.\n\nSeven points against the title favourites is no bad return and many Motherwell fans might be wondering \"what if?\"\n\nWhat if they hadn't drawn their first five league games? What if they hadn't chucked away a 3-0 lead over Hearts at Tynecastle?\n\nWhat if Calum Ward hadn't passed it straight to a Celtic player when they were 2-1 up at Celtic Park with 20 minutes to go?\n\nThey sit seven points behind third-placed Celtic, eight behind Rangers and 13 behind Hearts. It's most likely a step too far, but one of the Old Firm might be within their reach, including holding a game in hand over Rangers and the league leaders.\n\n\"What a team Motherwell are,\" Stewart gushed. \"They are such a great watch and showed some real desire.\n\n\"One nil down at home, down to 10 men, and they never buckled one little bit. They kept throwing everything at it. That's a good point for Rangers, because Motherwell were so on top.\"\n\nFormer Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson agreed: \"This is a Motherwell side that have been absolutely flying and they've shown different sides to their game tonight.\"",

    "description": "Thomas Frank has been sacked as Tottenham manager after just eight months in charge. BBC Sport's Sami Mokbel takes a closer look at his tenure.",
    "fullText": "Tottenham's decision to sack Thomas Frank was made almost immediately after Tuesday night's loss to Newcastle.\n\nChief executive Vinai Venkatesham, in conjunction with sporting director Johan Lange, made the call - one the club had been reluctant to make.\n\nBut the sorry state of Tottenham's season meant not even Frank's biggest advocate could disagree with the decision.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, Venkatesham made the recommendation to the Lewis family - the club's ownership - to dispense with Frank.\n\nIn recent weeks a furious fanbase have directed their ire towards the Lewises amid a widely held belief that supporters' views about Frank were not being listened to.\n\nAccording to conversations with those closely connected with the ownership, that was not the case - and the Lewis family were attuned to the widespread discontent from Spurs fans.\n\nOf course, it would have been harder not to notice given the ferocity of ill feeling towards the Dane in recent weeks.\n\nBut given they effectively handed the running of the club to Venkatesham when appointing him chief executive last summer, it is fair to say the ownership have not sought to intervene - feeling a decision should be made 'on the ground'.\n\nSo, when the recommendation from Venkatesham to terminate Frank's employment arrived in the hours after the loss to Newcastle it was accepted immediately by the ownership board, who formally approved the decision.\n\nAll that was left was for Frank to be officially informed of his departure - a formality that took place on Wednesday morning in a meeting between the manager, Venkatesham and Lange.\n\nFrank's appointment in June was welcomed at the time as a shrewd move.\n\nHe had done a superb job at Brentford to, firstly, earn promotion from the Championship and then, crucially, consolidate their position as a Premier League club.\n\nBut he lasted just eight months at Spurs amid player indiscipline, a split executive team and doubts over his tactical approach.\n\nWhy Frank at Tottenham was a gamble that ended in bitter failure\n\nFrank sacked by Spurs after eight months in charge\n\nFrank was intent on implementing a positive culture at Tottenham - having done so at Brentford - which was one of the factors behind the decision to appoint him as Ange Postecoglou's successor.\n\nThere have been instances, however, when Frank's efforts to build respectful working conditions for his players and staff were tested.\n\nTowards the start of his reign, Frank dropped a player from Tottenham's starting XI after the squad member reported late for a pre-match meeting and then did not apologise for the indiscretion.\n\nHowever, after being removed from the team the player did later apologise.\n\nThe way Frank handled apparent threats to his authority ultimately impressed some players, who liked the fact there were consequences for below-par behaviour.\n\nAn example came when Yves Bissouma was left in London for August's Uefa Super Cup against Paris St-Germain because of persistent lateness.\n\nIn recent days, meanwhile, Frank had no intention of stripping Cristian Romero of the captaincy despite the defender's social media outbursts against the club or his red card against Manchester United.\n\nRomero is said to be more difficult to manage around the club's training centre, and it is claimed some players felt the Argentine has been afforded preferential treatment.\n\nWhen Micky van der Ven and Djed Spence appeared to refuse to shake Frank's hand after the home loss to Chelsea, the manager defused the situation by insisting the players were simply \"frustrated\" before later revealing they had apologised.\n\nThere was always a sense Frank put his players before his own agendas. Certain members of the squad certainly appreciated that.\n\nBut that is not to say he left a positive impression on all of them.\n\nIn the opening weeks of his reign, some players are believed to have found Frank indecisive.\n\nThey were used to Postecoglou's big personality - although the Australian had become increasingly isolated during his final months in charge.\n\nThere were consistent reservations about Frank's tactical approach, too: concerns he was not assertive enough in matches and was too focused on adapting to the opposition rather than imposing Spurs' own strengths.\n\nThat image of Frank will do little to dispel the narrative the Tottenham job was simply too big for him.\n\nConcerns over Frank's appointment have been lingering for months.\n\nOne leading executive recommended the Dane should be sacked after the 2-1 home defeat by Fulham on 29 November - Tottenham's third-straight loss after reversals to Arsenal and PSG.\n\nFormer Brighton head coach Roberto de Zerbi - who was managing Marseille at the time - was also pushed as a potential replacement.\n\nBut that recommendation was rejected with the club continuing to put their faith in Frank.\n\nIt is interesting that the club's leadership group, led by Venkatesham, stuck with Frank for as long as they did.\n\nThe Dane's appointment was ultimately led by Daniel Levy - Tottenham's divisive former executive chairman who unexpectedly departed after 24 years in September.\n\nWhile Venkatesham was involved in the execution of the deal that took Frank across London, the groundwork was completed in advance of the CEO joining last summer.\n\nWith Levy gone, it appeared the easiest decision for Venkatesham would be to sack Frank given the increasing vitriol towards the head coach from fans.\n\nBut for Venkatesham, it was not as simple as that, despite the fact he knew it could increase his popularity.\n\nFor starters, Lange - who played a key role in Frank's identification as a leading candidate - was a close ally of his Danish compatriot.\n\nHowever, it is also true to say Tottenham's former co-sporting director Fabio Paratici, who has since joined Fiorentina, was not overly convinced Frank was the best man for the job.\n\nBut there is also a sense during the post-Levy era at Spurs that after years of chopping and changing managers they would benefit from a period of stability.\n\nVenkatesham saw first-hand at Arsenal what sticking with a manager when there are calls for his head can do for a club in Mikel Arteta, who has since established the Gunners as one of the best teams in Europe.\n\nLikewise, there was a belief from within Tottenham's hierarchy that Frank had been dealt a rough hand given the campaign has been disrupted by injuries to key players.\n\nThere is also recognition that the squad needs repair work – particularly considering the departures of their two main sources of goals in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\n\nLast season's top scorer Brennan Johnson has also left - although that was down to Frank deeming the Wales attacker was no longer part of his plans.\n\nThere is also a sense Tottenham's squad is lacking in leadership. It was why they signed England midfielder Conor Gallagher and tried to land Andy Robertson - both of whom have vast Premier League experience.\n\nUltimately, the foundations of Tottenham's faith in Frank were irreparably shaken after the home loss to relegation-threatened West Ham on 17 January.\n\nSources have suggested Spurs were close to ending Frank's reign after that defeat, which was attended by members of the Lewis family - Vivienne Lewis was confronted by an irate fan after the match.\n\nChampions League victories over Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt bought Frank some time - but the loss to Newcastle extended Tottenham's winless league run to eight matches and proved to be the Dane's last.\n\nVenkatesham and the club's new leadership team will now be tasked with making their first appointment.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether they seek an interim manager with a view to appointing a permanent boss in the summer, or want a full-time choice immediately.\n\nThere is certainly consideration behind the scenes to the interim option given how drastically the managerial landscape will change in the summer.\n\nOne option until the end of the season could be John Heitinga, who joined Tottenham as an assistant coach last month. The former Netherlands defender managed Ajax this season and was part of Arne Slot's Premier League title-winning coaching staff at Liverpool.\n\nFor the long term, the most obvious development will be the potential availability of Mauricio Pochettino after the World Cup.\n\nThe USA head coach has made no secret of his desire to return to Tottenham one day - and supporters have made no secret of their wishes for him to return.\n\nIt seems like a perfect match. But Spurs will have to wait until after the World Cup to appoint Pochettino.\n\nEven if it is not Pochettino, the likes of Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Marco Silva will be available for nothing in the summer.\n\nOther World Cup coaches including Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Julian Nagelsmann may also be obtainable.\n\nSo there is sense in buying time until the summer. Equally, however, the recent availability of De Zerbi, who left Marseille on Tuesday night, may interest Spurs.\n\nDe Zerbi is viewed as someone who can hit the ground running, a trait Tottenham could do with given their spiral towards the relegation zone.\n\nYes, he can be combustible. But if Spurs are looking for an instant impact, the Italian could fit the bill.\n\nSources are indicating Tottenham want an appointment in place by the time the players arrive back on Monday after a pre-planned five-day break.\n\nAmid on-field troubles, there have also been off-field rumours for the club's hierarchy to deal with - amid persistent rumblings Spurs could be sold.\n\nThis is despite it being reinforced to staff that Tottenham are not for sale. That correlates with public messaging despite industry rumours the Lewis family are open to selling.\n\nFormer Newcastle owner Amanda Staveley has been heavily linked with a continued interest in Tottenham despite a statement in September that she does not intend to make a formal offer for the club.\n\nOther consortiums, including groups from the USA, have also been linked with an interest in purchasing Spurs, while there were reports last week that Levy was looking at selling his stake in Tottenham after his departure.\n\nCombined with the results on the pitch and the changes off it, it has been an uncertain time.\n\nFor now though, all the attention is on the dugout and how Tottenham replace Frank.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Nordic combined is the only Olympic sport at Milan-Cortina that does not have a women's event. BBC Sport takes a look at why.",
    "fullText": "American Nordic combined skier Annika Malacinski dreams of becoming an Olympic athlete.\n\nInstead, she must watch from the sidelines as her younger brother, Niklas, realises that dream at the 2026 Winter Games.\n\nNordic combined - a combination of cross-country skiing and ski jumping - is the only Olympic discipline in which women cannot compete.\n\nThe event has been a feature of the Winter Olympics since the first edition in Chamonix in 1924 but has only ever been open to men, despite there being women's World Cup and World Championship events.\n\nMalacinski, 24, has been campaigning for the women's event to feature at the Olympics for years and in 2022 a formal proposal was made to include it in Italy this year.\n\nA similar proposal was made before the Beijing Olympics four years ago - both were denied.\n\nIn a post on Instagram in November, Malacinski said her Olympic dream had been taken away from her \"not because of my ability but because of my gender\".\n\n\"For years my team-mates and I have been speaking up, protesting and fighting for the chance to stand on the same Olympic start line as the men,\" she said.\n\n\"We're still here, we're still pushing, we're not giving up.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) says the event is \"in question overall\" and that it is not a discussion about women but about the sport as a whole, citing low participation across different countries and a lack of viewership.\n\nThis year 36 athletes are taking part in the men's event in Italy, down from 55 at Beijing 2022.\n\nThe IOC also says Milan-Cortina is the most gender-equal Winter Games with 47% of the athletes women, while 50 of the 116 events are for females.\n\nIOC spokesman Mark Adams said: \"To all intents and purposes we are gender balanced. We are taking a look at this [Nordic combined] here, the participants generally are from a small number of countries - it needs to be more universal and we will take a look at it for the next Winter Games.\"\n\nAnother spokesperson added: \"Going forward, we will take data points in order to evaluate these disciplines with respective events for French Alps 2030. If Nordic combined stays, women will be part of it.\"\n\nBut Malacinski says the sport has the same number of people competing in it as other niche sports, while she is concerned the sport's inclusion at the next Winter Olympics will be based solely on the performance of the men's event.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian, she said there are more than 40 women competing at a high level who are waiting for an opportunity to appear in the Olympics.\n\n\"Truthfully the IOC are just trying to take away the sport of Nordic combined so to solve equality they will just take away the sport,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not just me fighting for women, it is me fighting for the sport.\"\n\nShe said she plans to support her brother at the Olympics but will also be using it as an opportunity to raise awareness by holding up signs and encouraging people at home to tune in.\n\nIn 2023, women competing at a World Cup event drew beards and moustaches on their faces to protest against the decision not to include them in the Olympics.\n\nThey also held up their ski poles in an 'X' to highlight their #noeXception social media campaign.\n\nBilly Demong, a five-time Olympian in Nordic combined told the Associated Press the decision not to include the women's event in Italy is a \"travesty\", and \"one of the biggest moves against gender equity in the Olympic movement in history\".\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

and you can have your say on who you think should replace Frank.\n\nCurrent status: United States manager\n\nMajor honours: Coupe de France (2020-21), Ligue 1 title (2021-22)\n\nTottenham fans still have a lot of affection for Pochettino, who managed them from 2014 to 2019.\n\nThe Argentine guided Spurs to the Champions League final in 2019, where they lost 2-0 to Liverpool, and also led them to second and third-placed finishes in the Premier League during his tenure.\n\nSince his departure from Spurs in 2019, the London club have had Jose Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo, Antonio Conte, Ange Postecoglou and Frank as permanent managers.\n\nPochettino has said he \"would like one day to come back\" to Tottenham, although a return appears unlikely unless Spurs are willing to wait.\n\nHe has had stints at Chelsea and Paris St-Germain, leading the French giants to the Ligue 1 title.\n\nPochettino is currently in charge of the United States and is set to lead them at the upcoming World Cup coming up, which the USA is co-hosting.\n\nIn addition, the US soccer federation would be owed what has been described by a well-placed source as \"one of the biggest financial compensation fees in football history\" if Pochettino left for another club before the World Cup.\n\nRoberto de Zerbi parted ways with French club Marseille by mutual consent on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Italian led the French club to second in Ligue 1 last season but, after recently being knocked out of the Champions League and a 5-0 top-flight defeat by Paris St-Germain, he is back on the market.\n\nDe Zerbi has Premier League experience, having spent nearly two years at Brighton.\n\nThe former Shakhtar Donetsk coach led the Seagulls to sixth at the end of the 2022-23 season - the club's highest top-flight finish - and secured European qualification for the first time in their history.\n\nWhy Frank at Tottenham was a gamble that ended in bitter failure\n\nFrank sacked by Spurs after eight months in charge\n\nCurrent status: Bournemouth manager\n\nIraola has won plenty of admirers for his work as Bournemouth manager.\n\nHe was appointed by the Cherries in summer 2023 and finished 12th in the Premier League in his first season in England, before the south-coast side ended last season in ninth, with a club record top-flight points tally of 56.\n\nDespite Bournemouth selling the likes of Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi in the summer, they are currently ninth in the Premier League.\n\nIraola will be out of contract at the end of the season and, having been linked with Spurs before Frank's appointment, he could be another option.\n\nThe Spaniard was sacked from his first managerial job at AEK Larnaca in Cyprus before he took over at Spanish second-tier side Mirandes.\n\nHe then joined Rayo Vallecano prior to becoming Bournemouth boss, implementing an eye-catching high-pressing and high-energy style.\n\nCurrent status: Crystal Palace manager\n\nMajor honours: Europa League (2021-22), FA Cup (2024-25)\n\nGlasner is another manager who will soon be out of contract, having already said he will not sign a new deal with Crystal Palace and leave the club in the summer.\n\nThe Austrian will leave as an Eagles legend, having led them to their first major trophy with victory over Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final.\n\nThe win secured Palace a place in the Conference League - their first experience of a major European competition.\n\nGlasner, who lost key player Eberechi Eze to Arsenal in the summer, also guided Palace to a victory on penalties against Liverpool in the Community Shield before the start of this season.\n\nHe started his managerial career at Austrian side SV Reid before stints at LASK, Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nGlasner won the Europa League with Frankfurt in 2022 when his side beat Rangers on penalties in the final.\n\nMajor honours: Portuguese Cup (2014-15), Greek league title (2015-16), EFL Championship title (2021-22)\n\nMarco Silva's contract at Fulham runs out at the end of the season and, while the Cottagers are understood to have offered him a new deal, nothing has been signed as of yet.\n\nThe Portuguese led Fulham, where he took over in July 2021, back into the top flight in 2022 and has helped them maintain their status since.\n\nSilva started his managerial career in charge of Estoril, guiding them into the Portuguese top flight and the Europa League.\n\nIn his single season at Sporting he won the Portuguese Cup, and in his year at Olympiakos, who he also managed in the Champions League, he took them to the Greek league title.\n\nSilva then had stints at Hull City and Watford before being appointed by Everton in May 2018 and, despite being sacked after 18 months in charge, has gone some way to rebuilding his standing at Fulham.\n\nMajor honours: La Liga (2022-23)\n\nThe former Spain midfielder has been out of work since being sacked by Barcelona at the end of the 2023-24 season.\n\nHaving taken over at the Nou Camp in November 2021, he guided Barca to the La Liga title in 2022-23 in the season prior to his departure.\n\nTottenham may choose to wait until the summer to appoint a permanent manager and - like Manchester United - opt for an interim boss until the end of the season.\n\nFormer Netherlands defender John Heitinga joined Spurs as an assistant coach on 15 January and was previously part of Arne Slot's Premier League title-winning coaching staff at Liverpool.\n\nRyan Mason previously took temporary charge of Spurs after the sackings of Mourinho in 2021 and Conte in 2023 - and is out of work after being dismissed by West Brom in January.\n\nHarry Redknapp, meanwhile, has said he would \"love\" to take over at Tottenham until the end of the season.\n\nThe 78-year-old, who managed Spurs between 2008 and 2012, told BBC Sport in January: \"Confidence is key - [you have to] make them feel confident [and] put them in the right position.\n\n\"Tell them to start performing. You've got to be strong with them at the same time.\n\n\"They've got some good players, they just need to start performing, don't they?\"\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "With the 2026 Super League season about to kick off on its 30th anniversary, BBC Sport explains what to look out for during a bumper World Cup year.",
    "fullText": "Four months on since Hull KR wrapped up a clean sweep of trophies in 2025, Super League makes its return as it celebrates its 30th birthday.\n\nThree new clubs join an expanded league, there have been signings aplenty, another trip to Las Vegas coming up and it is a World Cup year too.\n\nBut what should you watch out for as the 'greatest game' makes its comeback for another season?\n\nBBC Sport has taken a look at some things to focus on when the curtain opens on the 2026 campaign on Thursday.\n\nThirty years after the inaugural Super League season got under way with 12 teams, this year the competition has expanded to 14 sides.\n\nIt is the first time since 2014 the league has operated with 14 teams having previously dipped down to 12 from the 2015 season.\n\nWith Salford dropping out at the end of last season, the league will welcome three clubs - two of which have played in the top flight before.\n\nBradford Bulls and Toulouse Olympique have both featured in Super League in the past but newcomers York Knights will make their debut this season as the sport continues to expand outside its traditional heartlands.\n\nKnights, whose women's team York Valkyrie have enjoyed plenty of success in the Women's Super League, were selected to join rugby league's top flight by an independent panel along with Toulouse, who come back to the top table following a one-season stint in 2022.\n\nThe panel judged applications against each club's financial performance in 2025, as well as their financial performance and sustainability forecasts for 2026 to 2028 and their ability to \"field a competitive team in 2026 and beyond\".\n\nHeadlined by the high-profile signing of Paul Vaughan from Warrington, York have ushered in a total of 14 new faces as they aim to hit the ground running in their maiden top-flight campaign.\n\nToulouse, meanwhile, welcome Wigan's Tyler Dupree on a season-long loan, hoping to establish themselves alongside Catalans as the league's French representation.\n\nSuper League to expand to 14 teams from 2026\n\nYork and Toulouse to play in expanded Super League\n\nBradford replace Salford in Super League for 2026\n\nTo those of a certain vintage, Bradford Bulls and Super League success are synonymous.\n\nThe club dominated the early Super League era, clinching four league titles and two Challenge Cups during their late 1990s and early 2000s heyday.\n\nFormerly a dominant force, the club lost their top-flight status in 2015 with Wigan Warriors, Leeds Rhinos and St Helens taking it in turns to dominate after Bradford ran out of steam.\n\nDuring their 11-year absence, the club has been plagued with financial troubles and had a stint in the former third-tier League One but, off the back of last season's grading system, they return to Super League.\n\nIconic head coach Brian Noble came back to the club last season and steered them to third in the Championship but they will enter the 2026 campaign under the stewardship of highly-rated former Salford coach Kurt Haggerty.\n\n\"The work we've done leading to round one has been probably more stressful than what's coming ahead,\" Haggerty told BBC Radio Leeds.\n\n\"We've had a lot of stress before we kicked a ball so if I can remain as calm as I have done up to now, I think we'll be ok and I'll be ok.\n\n\"There's a lot of good people around me like Brian Noble who I can rely on and get advice from if I need it.\"\n\nBradford, Toulouse and York have all had to piece together their respective squads for the 2026 season from October onwards, meaning it has been a mad dash to the line for the newcomers to contest the season.\n\nAsked what his ambition was for the coming campaign, Haggerty added: \"I think if we come away from this year with a load of respect, I'll be happy with that.\"\n\nThe expansion to 14 teams means the previously maligned loop fixtures are no more.\n\nThe format was introduced when the league was reduced to 12 sides and ensured that every team played 27 games over the course of a regular season.\n\nIn order for that to happen, however, four of those matches would be so-called loop fixtures where some clubs would face each other again during the regular season based on the final league table from the previous campaign.\n\nThis structure would occasionally lead to some teams having a pretty lopsided campaign - as was the case with St Helens last season, who virtually had a free hit against a chaotic Salford Red Devils side on three occasions while other clubs arguably had a more difficult run-in.\n\nThis led to criticism from many a coach over many a season but returning to a 14-team set-up means the regular season will now consist of 13 home games, 13 away and one Magic Weekend fixture played at a neutral venue - which this year takes place at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nOne side who will not feature in Super League this term are former Grand Finalists Salford.\n\nThe formerly named Red Devils endured a torrid 2025 campaign due to financial issues and frequently fielded youthful sides who were on the receiving end of some demoralising drubbings.\n\nThe club lost their place in Super League due to the end-of-season gradings and were later placed into liquidation by the High Court in December, which plunged its future into doubt.\n\nHowever, former player Mason Caton-Brown led a consortium to take over the club - now running under the Salford RLFC moniker - as they frantically put together the shell of a side to contest the 2026 Championship season in a matter of weeks after being given the go ahead from the Rugby Football League.\n\nHull KR come into the 2026 season off the back of a campaign which saw them win a clean sweep of Challenge Cup, League Leaders' Shield and the Super League Grand Final.\n\nThat success has shattered the glass ceiling as Willie Peters' side muscled their way in to the northern hemisphere elite, becoming only the fifth club in Super League history to win a Grand Final.\n\nBut will their dominance be tested? After all, Wigan came into last season off the back of a historic quadruple of trophies, yet they could not mount a challenge against Hull KR and came away at the end of the season empty-handed.\n\nSt Helens, Leeds and Leigh Leopards have recruited well as they look to dethrone the Robins, who also have a trip to Las Vegas to face the Rhinos and next week's World Club Challenge against National Rugby League premiers Brisbane Broncos to contend with in a packed calendar in the early part of the season.\n\nThere has been some turnover at the Robins, with Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Micky McIlorum retiring after October's showpiece, but the club have kept the spine of what has made them so successful in recent seasons.\n\nTalismanic half-back Mikey Lewis signed a huge five-year deal before the 2025 season ended and balancing the old and new is crucial to inspiring success in the future, KR forward Dean Hadley said.\n\n\"You look at any successful team, whatever sport that might be and they always have a core group of players and people, which includes the staff,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"When you've got a group where the majority have been together, you build relationships and connections and you get used to each other.\n\n\"Off the back of that it's important to bring in a few new additions and new energy. The boys that have come in have been really good and added to it but the majority of us have been together now for two or three years and hopefully we can carry on.\"\n\nWhat adds some extra spice to the season is the fact there is a World Cup at the end of it, as England's best and brightest aim to put themselves in the picture for a spot in the squad that will travel to Australia in October.\n\nWith Peters \"keen\" to have talks for the role of England boss after the departure of Shaun Wane, how many of his KR cohort will be on the plane down under later this year?",

    "description": "With Wales reeling from another thrashing by England, BBC Sport pundits analyse the areas they must improve against France.",
    "fullText": "There are countless problems facing Welsh rugby right now.\n\nSo to pick out five areas for the men's national team to improve before they face Six Nations champions France next weekend is like trying to choose which root vegetable you would use in a sword fight with a samurai.\n\nIt is coming up to three years since Wales won a Six Nations match, with Saturday's 48-7 drubbing by England the latest in a long, ever-increasing line of humiliations.\n\nThere are facets of Wales' game that urgently need addressing before freewheeling France bring their Grand Slam-chasing bandwagon to Cardiff.\n\nHere, BBC Sport pundits analyse some of the priorities for head coach Steve Tandy and his players.\n\nThe most obvious place to start is defence.\n\nWales have conceded 248 points - including 34 tries - in Tandy's first five games in charge.\n\nThose are grim statistics in any context but they will be particularly concerning for Tandy, who was previously defence coach for Scotland and the British and Irish Lions.\n\n\"There's so much to try and fix in a week, and you can't fix everything,\" former Scotland captain John Barclay said on Rugby Special.\n\n\"You fix the things that are easiest to fix. First up: tackling. Defence is much easier to do than attack - it's more of a mindset.\n\n\"If you're Wales defence coach, you're looking at the lack of intent in the tackle. That's not a skill decision, that's a mindset decision.\n\n\"How do we get in front of people? How do we slow them down? Let's fix our defence, let's be a hard team to play against, let's not give away easy wins.\n\n\"That's what they did against England - they gave away so much.\"\n\nWales were expected to lose against England - and heavily.\n\nWinning at Allianz Stadium in Twickenham is never easy for a visiting team, never mind one in a state of crisis.\n\nHowever, Wales' lack of discipline on Saturday made their task infinitely more difficult.\n\nWales conceded 16 penalties - their highest total in a Test since 2009 - and had four yellow cards, the joint most any team has been shown in a Six Nations match.\n\nTwo of those sin bins, for prop Nicky Smith and captain Dewi Lake, came in the opening 18 minutes.\n\n\"It's not possible to play international rugby and concede 11 penalties within the first 20-25 minutes and two yellow cards,\" former Wales scrum-half Richie Rees said on the Scrum V podcast.\n\n\"We saw the impact that it had towards the tail end of the game, the fatigue of the players, their body language. They were absolutely out on their feet.\n\n\"I don't blame them. Tomos Williams, Louis Rees-Zammit and Aaron Wainwright - they were completely out on their feet. It comes down to the indiscipline, that is something they can control.\n\n\"There were complete variants in the type of penalties that they gave away, but it's something that they simply have to improve, and at least it is something that is in their domain.\n\n\"There's a couple of other things going into France next week .What are we really going to hang our hat on? It has to be our discipline; it has to be miles better because if that happens again, it's going to be a repeat of what we've just seen.\"\n\nGiven Wales' sorry recent form, only a handful of players can be sure of their places in the team to face France on Sunday.\n\n\"We have to change some players because some of those players have had plenty of chances, and they're simply not good enough on the international level,\" ex-Wales back-rower Emyr Lewis told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast.\n\n\"I don't like to name individuals but, without a doubt, the balance in midfield isn't right, so I would definitely bring bigger players in like Owen Watkin. We know how good he is defensively and we have to have a strong defence against France.\n\n\"The back row, again no balance there, we have to bring in bigger players especially against such a huge French pack. I'd definitely bring in Ollie Cracknell.\n\n\"We have to look at bringing in big, strong, rough players who will give the French pack a challenge.\"\n\nFormer Wales centre Scott Williams is another who would like to see changes in his old position.\n\n\"As a former centre, Ben Thomas didn't have the best of games if I'm honest,\" Williams said on Scrum V.\n\n\"Eddie James can be a real weapon for us, he's a massive guy, but I looked at the stats and he had three carries.\n\n\"I know that's not all on him, that's the way the game went. But he's a 12 in my eyes. He needs to get on the ball, needs to get Wales over the gain line. He's 108 kilos, or whatever he is, he's hard to stop.\n\n\"I'd like to see Eddie James at 12. He needs to be at 12. Whether Ben Thomas goes 13 or whatever, I just think he's a little bit lost there.\"\n\nRees also wants to see bigger, more physically imposing players selected.\n\n\"For me you need [wing or centre] Mason Grady and [prop] Rhys Carre on the field,\" he said on the same podcast.\n\n\"Otherwise France could run away with the game early on and it becomes difficult when you try and bring them on too late, as we saw against England.\"\n\nWales did not get much of a chance to show their attacking threat against England because they spent most of the match defending.\n\nOn the rare occasions they did have the ball, Wales' lineout malfunctioned and the backs did not click into gear.\n\n\"I couldn't see an identity with Wales and we didn't do the simple things right,\" former Wales and Lions wing Alex Cuthbert told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"Lineouts were a problem all game. Their skills came under pressure and they made errors. That's what happens when you can't match up physically and, right now, we just don't have those players.\n\n\"Even when we scored it was just one way. It was slow, lethargic and we looked like we were lacking ideas. That's what happens when you lose power.\n\n\"[Wales attack coach] Matt Sherratt will be very detailed in attack about first plays off lineout and scrum but, when you don't win the first couple of collisions and you don't have parity [up front], then there's nothing you can really do.\n\n\"We're 11th in world and I don't see us better than, say, Italy in 10th.\"\n\nThe technical side of the game is enough of a concern but, according to former England wing Chris Ashton, Wales' mauling at Twickenham also exposed some mental flaws.\n\n\"It was the easy stuff that let them down,\" he said on Rugby Special.\n\n\"It's the easier part of the game to be mentally switched on, to not give penalties away, to not allow England into your 22 and give easy tries away.\n\n\"You'd think that's a side of the game that you can take for granted, that the lads would be switched on, but they weren't.\n\n\"It just goes to show he [Tandy] is trying to put fires out everywhere and sometimes you can lose concentration on what you're trying to do.\n\n\"Steve's meant to be the defence coach, and that's an area that's struggling. Is he trying to spread himself too thinly across everywhere instead of concentrating on one department?\"\n\nEven if Wales significantly improve all these elements of their play, they still face a daunting task when France visit Principality Stadium.\n\nLes Bleus tore Ireland to shreds in their opening 36-14 win on Thursday, scoring five tries in a devastating attacking display.\n\nIf France were able to dismantle Ireland so brutally, it is a frightening prospect to consider what they might do to Wales.\n\n\"I'm very worried about Sunday,\" former Wales wing Philippa Tuttiett told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"I hate to say this being Welsh but, as a rugby fan, I'm actually excited to see this France team and the brand of rugby they are playing.\n\n\"That loss in the autumn to South Africa seems to have ignited them and, even though they won the Six Nations last year, they seem to have taken their game to another level.\n\n\"The way this fresh-faced France beat Ireland was so impressive and Wales should be fearful.\"",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on golf superstar Ian Poulter plus the BBC readers and AI with his predictions for this week's midweek Premier League fixtures.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's mental strength was questioned when their previous Premier League title run-ins faltered under Mikel Arteta, but one of their most famous fans feels their mindset will not be an issue this season.\n\nGolf superstar Ian Poulter, renowned for his own rock-solid self-belief and dominant performances under pressure in the Ryder Cup, feels Arteta has that side of things under control.\n\n\"I definitely don't need to give them a pep talk about it,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Mikel has got that nicely covered and they are in the right place. He really backs them up 100%, even if they make mistakes.\n\n\"Some of them have got some scar tissue of not getting over the line in the past but, mentally, you would hope Mikel has got the players more together than ever just by saying 'look you know you are good enough and we now have a deep enough squad, so you have every reason to go into every game more confident than you were before'.\"\n\nYou can watch Poulter play for Majesticks GC, external at the LIV Golf event in Adelaide, Australia from 12-15 February on TNT Sports.\n\nHe is also taking on BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton - as well as the BBC readers and AI - by trying to predict the results of this week's midweek Premier League matches on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nBefore turning to golf, 50-year-old Poulter was a keen footballer and had trials with Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham aged 13.\n\n\"I am so glad that never worked out!\" he explained. \"I had two left feet, and it turned out everyone else Spurs have signed since has got two left feet as well.\n\n\"As soon as I turned 16, my focus was 100% on golf, and every waking minute of the day was about me being my own boss and telling myself that if I worked hard enough I would achieve big things.\n\n\"But I do miss football. I miss the kind of team camaraderie it gave me and I think that's why I've always loved the Ryder Cup as much as I've loved it.\n\n\"It's because that's where I can get the team aspect, the bonding and learning to how to win as a team, as well as the disappointments that come with that as well - I've always loved the dynamic of that extra pressure.\n\n\"Obviously going out to play golf for yourself is fine and you can take the hit if it doesn't work out, but having that the extra weight of playing for your peers and your captain is nice - if you can deal with it.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Ian Poulter were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nLeeds turned Chelsea over at Elland Road in December but they are not the same force away from home and this game smells of Chelsea revenge to me.\n\nThe Blues have made a good start under new boss Liam Rosenior, with four wins out of four in the league. Cole Palmer has hit form too, and they should win this fairly comfortably.\n\nIan's prediction: We annihilated Leeds a few days ago, and could have scored way more than the four we got. Chelsea look pretty solid at the moment too. 3-0\n\nEverton did well to fight back to beat Fulham late on at the weekend, but they could have been more than just a goal down at the break, while Bournemouth were unlucky only to draw with Aston Villa. They peppered Villa's goal with shots.\n\nI am going to go a bit leftfield here because although Everton beat Bournemouth earlier in the season, it was only thanks to a late deflected effort by Jack Grealish.\n\nI usually back Everton at home, and I'm usually wrong... so I am going to do something different this time. I am backing Bournemouth to pinch it.\n\nIan's prediction: It will be close but Everton to take it. 1-0\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 19:30\n\nTottenham captain Cristian Romero let his manager down with his red card against Manchester United, and now he is facing a four-game ban.\n\nIt's fine for Romero to be a motor mouth on social media, calling the club's recruitment \"disgraceful\", but he clearly needs to concentrate on his own game because he has been wild in the challenge again.\n\nFor a manager like Thomas Frank, who is under pressure, that is the last thing you need.\n\nPoor old Eddie Howe is feeling the heat at Newcastle too, though. We had callers in to 606 at the weekend saying it is time for a change - my reaction was 'what!?'.\n\nI really don't get that thinking at all, and not just because Howe's the guy who ended their long wait for a trophy, less than a year ago.\n\nHis squad is stretched now because of the Champions League and their run to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and he also had everything around Alexander Isak's exit to deal with at the start of the season, when it wasn't his doing.\n\nHowe just hasn't been able to replace Isak, either. Yoane Wissa has taken a while to get up and running and Nick Woltemade is very different to Isak in that he likes to come to the ball all the time.\n\nPeople are saying a change of voice might help, but what about backing the guy who has given you so much happiness? I don't understand why you'd want him out.\n\nThis is a very difficult game to predict for various reasons, but we do know Spurs are poor at home and Newcastle aren't great away.\n\nI still think someone will win it, but I am going to sit in the middle anyway, and go for a draw.\n\nIan's prediction: A point apiece. 1-1\n\nBoth of these teams have found a bit of form, and West Ham's victory over Burnley was huge for them in their fight against the drop.\n\nIt seems Manchester United can do no wrong under Michael Carrick, who has often been linked with the West Ham job down the years but goes back to his old club looking for a fifth straight win.\n\nI think he will get it, too. We had some callers into 606 thinking United would be Arsenal's biggest challengers from now on, which seems a stretch, but there is no doubt they are on a bit of a high.\n\nThis is the sort of game where idiots like me can get sucked in and get on the Carrick bandwagon... I am wary, but I am still going to be positive and jump on board too.\n\nIan's prediction: I don't like to say it but United have won their past four games and they have actually looked really good. They have got the bit between their teeth. 0-2\n\nBrighton have only won one of their past 12 league games so the worry for them has to be that they will get sucked into the relegation scrap.\n\nIt was a 4-3 home defeat by Aston Villa in December that was the start of this poor run for Fabian Hurzeler's side, and I don't see it ending at Villa Park.\n\nI'm surprised that the Seagulls are struggling. I looked at their bench against Crystal Palace at the weekend and thought 'blimey, they've got a good squad' but they are underperforming and the fans seem really split on Hurzeler, and have been for a while.\n\nVilla were lucky to get a point against Bournemouth at the weekend and I couldn't believe how Lucas Digne just let Rayan run past him for the Cherries equaliser. He seemed to give up and it was astonishingly bad defending.\n\nUnai Emery's side have lost their past two home league games, against Everton and Brentford, which worries me.\n\nWill it be a hat-trick of home defeats, or will they come good again? I've got to back my old team, so I am going with my heart here and saying Morgan Rogers will make the difference.\n\nIan's prediction: Villa might stumble again. 0-0\n\nCrystal Palace's win over Brighton was a huge result for them and the Eagles are definitely not short of firepower - if anything they have got too many centre-forwards now, but that's a good problem to have.\n\nBurnley have had it though - I thought that before they lost at home to West Ham on Saturday, but there can't be any doubt they are going down now.\n\nI don't think the Clarets will get anything here, either, but their fans seem to have turned on manager Scott Parker which I really don't like.\n\nThis is the guy who got them up but because the other promoted sides, Sunderland and Leeds, are having better seasons, that has gone against him.\n\nJust on the eyes, whenever I've watched them, Burnley have been competitive and have been in games.\n\nI just think there needs to be a bit of patience from their supporters, but of course they are entitled to their opinion.\n\nIan's prediction: Burnley really need a win but they won't get one. 1-0\n\nWas Sunday's late comeback to win at Anfield the game that will spark Manchester City's title bid?\n\nTime will tell, but I am not convinced. I still think the issues that saw City fall behind in the first place will still cost them in future games too.\n\nFair play to Pep Guardiola's side for turning things around with six minutes to go, because their record at Anfield was so poor and a point would not have been enough for them.\n\nBut I just don't see this City team controlling games any\n\nSunday was no different. They were getting mauled in the second half by wave after wave of Liverpool attacks, before the chaos at the end. Gianluigi Donnarumma's save was a big moment and I was delighted that Erling Haaland stuck his penalty away because he's captain of my fantasy team and that gave me a good score.\n\nAs a neutral, I hope the title race lasts until the final few weeks of the season but I just feel like City will drop too many more points before then.\n\nFulham are a good footballing side and almost got something from City at Craven Cottage in December - I was there, and City only just held on for a 5-4 win.\n\nMarco Silva's side have been hard done by in their past couple of games because they had plenty of chances in their defeat at Manchester United, then could have been well ahead at the break before they lost to Everton too.\n\nThis time? Well I think Fulham will score at Etihad Stadium too, and they are due a bit of a break. Maybe they will get it against City, but I am still going for a home win.\n\nIan's prediction: City will win this one. 2-0\n\nI was at Elland Road on Friday and Nottingham Forest were insipid in their defeat by Leeds - they were really flat.\n\nThis is a real pressure game for Forest, and in many ways it is the worst possible fixture for them. Wolves are hopeless so, if Forest win, their fans will say 'well we should be beating them, because they are rubbish'.\n\nLose or even drop points, however, then you can imagine the atmosphere and the mood of the fans, and the pressure that will put on the players.\n\nI don't mean pressure in terms of any calls to sack Forest boss Sean Dyche, but the negativity there will be around the team, when the mood of the fans can be massive when a team is fighting the drop.\n\nLeeds are a great example of that, actually. Just look at the positivity at Elland Road recently and how that has helped Leeds in the past few weeks. It was a very different story when the fans were unhappy earlier in the season.\n\nAs for Wolves, well they are not under any pressure any more.\n\nThey are playing for pride which is totally different to Forest's situation, where every point counts - and this is going to be a nervy night for the home fans at the City Ground.\n\nIan's prediction: Forest to edge it. 1-0\n\nThe Liverpool fans seem to have had enough of Arne Slot, which again makes no sense to me. Just because they aren't going to win the title again doesn't mean they aren't building anything.\n\nIt seems that making the Champions League places is like the title used to be now - as in, if you don't make the Champions League then the manager has got to go. It drives me potty.\n\nI know Sunderland lost at Arsenal on Saturday but I still enjoyed their performance.\n\nThat might sound odd because they were beaten 3-0 but I still thought the Black Cats were competitive, and they were really physical too. They matched Arsenal for long spells of the game.\n\nSo, Liverpool will know what to expect when they try to become the first team to win at Stadium of Light this season, and this is going to be a very difficult game for them.\n\nSlot needs a positive result here, for Liverpool to keep in touch with the teams above them in the race for the top four. My only concern about Sunderland is whether they can bring that same physicality again, but I still don't think Liverpool will win.\n\nIan's prediction: I just have a feeling Liverpool can sneak this one. 1-2\n\nCan Brentford produce another shock after beating Aston Villa and Newcastle in the past couple of weeks? No, they can't.\n\nKeith Andrews has done an incredible job as Bees boss and they will make life difficult for Arsenal because they are well organised and dangerous on the break.\n\nBut I still think Arsenal will win because of their sheer power that means they can run through anything.\n\nThis might not be the most entertaining game to watch, because Brentford will sit in and defend, and counter.\n\nArsenal will deal with that, and then find a way of scoring. A deflected goal will probably decide it.\n\nPeople might say the way they win games is not pretty but there is still a lot to admire about Arsenal and, in the end, no matter what anyone says, it is all about winning, isn't it?\n\nArsenal are very good at winning games, and I am expecting them to win this one too. In my opinion, they will go on and win the title too, because of the quality of their squad and how good they are defensively.\n\nAs much as you want beauty to triumph over a beast, City are still far too flaky for that to happen.\n\nIan on Arsenal's title hopes: I feel pretty confident, even with the couple of slip-ups we've had in the past month. We've got the strength in depth we need where other players can step up when we are missing players through injury.\n\nIf Viktor Gyokeres can start filling the onion bag up and Bukayo Saka can bag a few as well then that would be nice, but we look so good from set-pieces anyway. Our scoring stats from open play could be a bit of an issue but as long as we are scoring and winning then it doesn't really matter.\n\nIan's prediction: This is going to be a non-stressful win. We will be 2-0 up, concede a stupid goal but then finish the game off. 1-3\n\nChris and AI both got four correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week 25, giving them a total of 40 points apiece.\n\nHis guest, Gladiators star Apollo, was right about Manchester City's win at Anfield [everyone else went for a 2-2 draw] and ended up on 70 points thanks to four correct results including one exact score.\n\nBut the win went to the collective efforts of the BBC readers, with five correct results and one exact score [Bournemouth's 1-1 draw with Aston Villa] for a tally of 80 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Eagle-eyed viewers of figure skating may have thought they were seeing double when French coach Benoit Richaud was pictured wearing the jackets of both Canada and Georgia within the space of 15 minutes on Sunday evening.\n\nRichaud, 38, is a coach and choreographer who is working with 16 different skaters at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, with those athletes coming from a total of 13 different countries.\n\nCoaching this combination of athletes from different countries in the same event led to Richaud being caught on camera wearing two different team jackets during the team event final in a short space of time.\n\nHe was first pictured in the crowd sporting a jacket of the Georgia national team in support of Nika Egadze.\n\nLess than 15 minutes later, Richaud was again spotted in the crowd - only this time he was wearing a Canada team jacket to support Stephen Gogolev, another one of his athletes.\n\n\"It's an organisation. It's going to be fast,\" Richaud told BBC's More Than the Score podcast.\n\n\"It's actually very demanding emotionally because, you know, depending on [how it goes]. Let's imagine everything is fine and beautiful and everyone skates good, very easy.\n\n\"If one skates bad, then the other one skates good, you have this peak of emotion that is very difficult to express because it's something like when you are with your skater, you are fully with them.\n\n\"Thank God they are not one after the other one... then it's very, very difficult.\n\n\"People laugh because I'm always wearing black. And now everyone is like, how it's possible we see Benoit with different colours?\"\n\nThere are a lot of logistics involved in switching between coaching and supporting athletes from different nations in quick succession - including the ability to change which jacket Richaud is wearing at quick notice.\n\n\"I usually put everything in the dressing room of the skater,\" the French choreographer said. \"Usually, I'm not allowed but they let me put some stuff [in there]. They very friendly.\n\n\"If not, we always have like a team leader or the manager of the national team who keeps the jackets and they give it to me.\"\n\nAmong Richaud's skaters also include Spanish athlete Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate, who has become popular at the Olympics due to his performance in tribute to the Minions films.\n\nRichaud's popularity as a coach is no surprise when you look at his track record to date.\n\nAs a skater, he won the Junior French Championships while skating in partnership with Elodie Brouiller in 2005-06.\n\nThree years later, Richaud also finished third at senior level at this competition in partnership with Canada's Terry Findlay.\n\nBut it is as a coach and choreographer where Richaud has found more success.\n\nAt the 2024 ISU Skating Awards, he was named Best Figure Skater Choreographer, an award he was also shortlisted for in 2025.\n\nOf the five skaters in Sunday's men's final, two being coached by Richaud is a testament to how he is rated in the sport.\n\nWhile all athletes are representing their own countries, in figure skating they tend to be coached individually rather than per nation.\n\nRichaud is a prime example of this, with his 16 athletes coming from 13 different countries.\n\nRules allow coaches to work with athletes from multiple different nations, even if they are competing against each other.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhat is the difference between bobsleigh, skeleton and luge?\n\nWhich country is the most successful at the Winter Olympics?\n\nHow are points scored in snowboard big air?\n\nWhen and where will 2030 Winter Olympics be held?",

    "description": "BBC Sport Wales looks at how Wrexham have evolved since being taken over by Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac five years ago.",
    "fullText": "Five years ago, Wrexham's fortunes changed immeasurably.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Rob Mac completed their takeover of the north Wales side on 9 February, 2021 after receiving overwhelming approval from the Wrexham Supporters Trust three months earlier.\n\nThe Hollywood stars have overseen three successive promotions, although their impact goes way beyond the club's seismic on-field achievements.\n\nAs defender Max Cleworth puts it, \"it's been a mental few years\".\n\nFive years of Hollywood owners - the Wrexham timeline\n\nWrexham's on field success is plain for all to see, however, background developments and groundworks are equally important to sustain Reynold's and Mac's ambitions for the north Wales club.\n\nRegulars at the Stok Cae Ras - or the millions of viewers watching games on screens around the globe - will also have noticed a number of alterations to the world's oldest international football stadium still in continuous use.\n\nThe stadium's iconic Kop Stand was demolished in 2023 having been abandoned for 16 years.\n\nA temporary stand, holding around 3,000 supporters, was used during the 2024-25 campaign before being removed to pave way for a new permanent stand.\n\nWork on the stand - which will hold 7,500 fans in total, taking the overall capacity at Stok Cae Ras to 18,000 - started early on in the 2025-26 season and is due to be completed in early 2027.\n\nAs they do not own their Colliers Park training complex, Wrexham are regularly required to train elsewhere, including at Carden Park or at The Rock - now owned by the club.\n\nBut even other aspects including catering and travel arrangements - which include flying to some away matches to help aid recovery - have been tweaked to improve performance.\n\n\"The difference is massive,\" said former club captain Ben Tozer, who made 136 appearances and won back-to-back promotions with Wrexham.\n\n\"Even though some of the really big changes might not have happened – like we still don't have our own training ground – the infrastructure has improved every year.\n\n\"The players always felt looked after, but the levels have gone up.\"\n\nThe growth is not limited to the men's first team though. Far from it.\n\nAcademy manager Gus Williams and professional development phase lead coach Craig Knight are now in situ as the club aims to produce more home-grown talent.\n\nThe women's side have made enormous strides too.\n\nWrexham were in the tier two Adran North at the time of the takeover but are now challenging for the top-flight Adran Premier title - with a place in Europe on the line.\n\nThey also face reigning league champions Cardiff City in the final of the Adran Trophy on 22 February - further typifying how they have developed into one of the best women's sides in Wales.\n\nIt has all ensured the difference at the club is stark, particularly for new signing Davis Keillor-Dunn, who recently returned six years after leaving Wrexham.\n\n\"I'm just buzzing to see the club in the place it's in now,\" he told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"It shows you how much work has been put in and you're seeing the fruits of it on the pitch.\"\n\nLittle by little, piece by piece, the club keeps evolving. But the headline-grabbing exploits of the first team have ultimately been the key driver.\n\n\"It's the balance of building the club and understanding that the club needed some foundations put in place for the long-term,\" said manager Phil Parkinson.\n\n\"But also that we needed to fast-track the quality at first team level because the squad had been neglected for many years, no-one's fault, through a lack of finances, and [the owners] have been very supportive in both of those categories.\"\n\nLate transfer flurry sets Wrexham up for run-in\n\nGlobal brand in an EFL world - Wrexham's £48m cash injection explained\n\nA mere 110 days after the high-profile change in ownership, manager Dean Keates left the club with Wrexham having missed out on a play-off spot in the fifth-tier National League.\n\nJust 32 days later, Parkinson was tasked with leading the Welsh side's resurgence. Despite a gut-wrenching end to his first season as manager, a 5-4 defeat by Grimsby Town in the play-offs, it has been quite the ride since then.\n\nParkinson has managed 213 regular season league matches and Wrexham's record over that period borders on the ridiculous, in a positive way, of course.\n\nHe has overseen 125 wins, 51 draws and just 37 losses - with his side scoring 407 goals over that time.\n\nIt gives him an astonishing rate of exactly two points per game and an average of little more than 1.9 goals per match when it comes to regular season league fixtures.\n\nIn 2025, history was made as Wrexham returned to the second tier for the first time in 43 years, having become the first ever team to achieve three successive promotions in the English Football League.\n\nIn preparation for the Championship Wrexham smashed their own transfer record three times last summer, with Liberato Cacace, Lewis O'Brien and then Nathan Broadhead becoming their most expensive signing upon moving to north Wales.\n\nAnd having once again strengthened in the mid-season window, Wrexham are not slowing down.\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\nDefender Cleworth is one of only two players, along with Ryan Barnett, to feature in the National League, League Two, League One and the Championship since Reynolds and Mac bought Wrexham.\n\nOn the back of signing a long-term contract extension with the club in January, the academy product said: \"Since I signed my [first] pro deal, I couldn't really have imagined to be sat here five, six years later in the Championship.\"\n\nWrexham were seventh in the National League when Reynolds and Mac were announced as the club's new owners. At present, they are sixth in the Championship - 73 places higher up the football pyramid.\n\nThe social media growth has also been vast. Wrexham had 41,000 followers on Instagram prior to the takeover, that figure has ballooned to 1.5m.\n\nBut perhaps the clearest indicator of the astronomical growth is the value of the club, which now stands at around £350m, an increase of 17,400% compared to the £2m Reynolds and Mac invested upon completing the takeover in 2021.\n\nWith a top six finish firmly within their grasp this season, the rise is showing no sign of stopping, with Cleworth aptly stating: \"It's been a hell of a ride so far, long may that continue.\"",

    "fullText": "For the first time since before Christmas, just three points will separate the teams in 17th and 18th at the end of a Premier League weekend.\n\nWest Ham's 2-0 victory at Burnley has at last dragged them to within touching distance of Nottingham Forest again, with the Hammers enjoying a mid-season renaissance by winning three of their past four matches.\n\nWhile Wolves and Burnley are cut completely adrift, Nuno Espirito Santo's team are seemingly keeping the relegation battle alive single-handedly.\n\nThere have only been 10 occasions since the Premier League was formed in 1992-93 that the fight for survival has not gone down to the final day - although five of those have occurred in the last decade.\n\nSo after some damp squibs in recent years, are we set for an unusually exciting end to the campaign at the bottom of the table?\n\nBBC Sport looks at how things are shaping up as clubs attempt to avoid the dreaded drop into the Championship.\n\nWhile Wolves are not mathematically down yet, they are propping up the table on a meagre eight points from 25 matches and sports analytics and data experts Opta rank their chances of relegation as 99.99%.\n\nThat also effectively means the West Midlands club are in a scrap to avoid the unwanted record of winning the fewest points in a single Premier League campaign, currently held by Derby, who managed just 11 in 2007-08.\n\nMeanwhile, Burnley's loss to the Hammers means there is a 99.4% chance they will spend next term in the second tier of English football.\n\nThere was an air of frustration around Turf Moor on Saturday with the home fans castigating the players and calling for Scott Parker's dismissal as boss after watching their team fail to win for a 16th consecutive match.\n\n\"Whether we fail or we don't fail, we come through this for sure,\" said Parker.\n\n\"I'm really sorry that I can't promise we'll be better for it with a win or with staying in this division but the longer the journey is, we will be better for it.\"\n\nHammers boss Nuno said his side \"are still in the same situation\" and called on them to \"focus on\" themselves after winning in Lancashire.\n\nHaving gone 10 Premier League matches without a win, West Ham appear to have built some momentum from Callum Wilson's dramatic late goal at Tottenham on 17 January.\n\nAnd they will feel they can tackle their remaining 13 games with renewed optimism despite being ranked with a 75.77% chance of going down, with Nuno also having the experience of guiding Nottingham Forest to safety on the final day of the 2023-24 campaign.\n\n\"West Ham look more like a Nuno team over the last few weeks,\" said former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy, who is a pundit on Saturday's Match of the Day.\n\n\"They have won three out of four and have all the momentum. Crysencio Summerville is playing out of his skin and Jarrod Bowen is always going to chip in, plus they've signed two strikers.\n\n\"All of a sudden they look like a team that can score goals and that means you don't have to rely so heavily on keeping them out the other end.\n\n\"However, you'd always rather have the points in the bag than doing the chasing as you can't have many slip-ups - you have to keep on getting points.\"\n\nWhile Forest are just three points above West Ham in 17th, Sean Dyche will hope his side has the quality to pull clear having spent around £200m on players over the last 12 months.\n\nOpta rank the two-time champions of Europe as having a 15.3% chance of being relegated and it is likely Dyche will have to juggle his resources due to the club's continued involvement in the Europa League, where they are due to face Fenerbahce in the knockout play-offs for the last 16.\n\n\"Too many times recently, I've seen Nottingham Forest look passive,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Whether that's legginess from the amount of games in which Sean Dyche has had to play the same players. He gave fringe players the chance to stake their claim against Wrexham and they didn't take it, so he's had to pick the same eight or nine week in week out.\n\n\"I've done it myself and it's hard trying to play every few days and playing to your best, especially under pressure of relegation. Plus, they are trying to manage Europe as well.\"\n\nLeeds, who claimed a valuable win over Forest on Friday, appear to be in the best form of the three sides on 29 points.\n\nCrystal Palace, who travel to Brighton on Sunday, appear to be in disarray after the departure of captain Marc Guehi and manager Oliver Glasner's confirmation he will be leaving the club at the end of the season.\n\nTottenham have also taken just four of the past 21 points available and have not won a top-flight game since the start of the year.\n\n\"Palace have got a scrap on their hands as confidence is draining,\" added Murphy.\n\n\"I'm like the majority and think Tottenham will be OK even though the results don't say it. Their squad and the quality they've got will come good and they will get enough points.\n\n\"Leeds, for me, are the ones who will be safe given the way they have played in the last two or three months. They have some really nice momentum. And we all know about the Elland Road factor, which is huge.\n\n\"So, I think it's between Forest, Palace and West Ham. It is going to be so tight. I really think its going to go down to the wire.\"\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "description": "BBC health correspondent James Gallagher gets his blood analysed to understand how air pollution is killing us.",
    "fullText": "I'm in a laboratory staring at my blood under a microscope. Rather than pristine red blood cells, some of them have been tainted with black markings. I'm now one of the first people in the world to see air pollution building up inside their body.\n\nLess than an hour ago I was standing next to four lanes of busy central London traffic. It was the type of road where you can taste the air and you're left with a gritty sensation in your mouth.\n\nI had volunteered to stand there for 10 minutes; breathing in dirty air as part of an experiment to understand how air pollution is affecting our bodies and damaging our health.\n\nIn the UK, poor air quality is thought to kill 30,000 people a year, as well as harming babies in the womb and exacerbating conditions from asthma to dementia.\n\nMost of the air pollution I was breathing in came from traffic – billowing invisibly out of exhaust pipes, but also released by the wear and tear of tyres and brakes.\n\nProf Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, calls this spot his \"exposure chamber\".\n\nShouting over the blare of revving engines and sirens, he tells me most people incorrectly assume air pollution is all filtered out by our nose or mouth, or is trapped and then brought up out of the lungs.\n\n\"What we're looking at is whether the smallest particles are not only staying in your lung, but moving across into your bloodstream and going around your body,\" says Grigg.\n\nAfter our dose of London air, we head back to the laboratory where I have my finger pricked and a sample of blood prepared for examination.\n\nUnder the microscope, we can easily see the red disc-shaped cells that transport oxygen around our bodies.\n\nIt takes a few minutes for me to get my eyes in, but then the air pollution becomes apparent. It appears as tiny black dots stuck to the red blood cells.\n\nThese are pieces of carbon and other chemicals, like a miniature lump of coal, that come from the incomplete burning of fuel. They're known as PM 2.5, because the particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometres.\n\nI'm not surprised to see air pollution, it's why we're doing the experiment, but I can't escape a feeling of being dirtied, contaminated… sullied by it.\n\nResearcher Dr Norrice Liu has looked at more than a dozen volunteers' blood samples as part of a study.\n\nOn average, one in every two to three thousand red blood cells had picked up a hitch-hiking piece of pollution.\n\nThat might not sound like much, but scale it up to the full five litres of blood in an adult and the researchers estimate there could be 80 million red blood cells transporting pollution around our bodies.\n\n\"It's a bit upsetting to see that, isn't it?\" says Liu. \"Every time I walk by a busy road, now I'm thinking how much of this is travelling around my body… you just feel like you don't want to be out on the road much.\"\n\nI stood beside the road for just 10 minutes. It was busy, but it was not an extreme scenario. Your blood has probably looked like this too.\n\nThe team at Queen Mary University of London have shown that levels of air pollution in the blood come back down after about two hours of breathing clean air.\n\nGrigg was \"pretty shocked\" the air pollution was so visible in blood, but says the important question is where it's going.\n\nIt's not being breathed back out, he says, some may be filtered out by the kidneys and leave the body in urine. But the most likely answer is that particles of pollution are \"wiggling their way through the lining of the blood vessels and lodging in various organs\".\n\nThis research is starting to explain why air pollution has been linked to so many health problems far beyond the lungs, including in the brain and for babies still in the womb.\n\nDeposits of black carbon from air pollution have been found in the human body including in placentas analysed after birth.\n\n\"There's no reason why it's choosing one organ over another,\" says Liu, \"so chances are they're everywhere.\"\n\nAnd there are other forms of air pollution, such as nitrogen oxides, which are gases and are not visible down the microscope, but are known to cause harm.\n\nThe World Health Organization says 99% of the world population breathes in polluted air leading to seven million deaths a year. A report by the Royal College of Physicians estimates the figure for the UK is 30,000 deaths a year.\n\nSir Stephen Holgate, who led that report, said there was no doubt air pollution was damaging our health - \"it's nailed, it's game set and match\" - and the clearest evidence was coming from areas that were cutting air pollution and seeing the benefit.\n\nBut now that air pollution is \"largely invisible\", unlike the smogs of yesteryear, most of us don't realise we're breathing it in and \"don't really understand that air pollution on a daily basis is damaging\", he says.\n\nAir pollution has been linked to harms throughout our lives and throughout our bodies.\n\nThere are many ways dirty air can harm the other organs of our body, but triggering inflammation is thought to be the main one. Inflammation is our body's natural response to injury and infection, but can also affect blood vessels to make heart attacks and strokes more likely.\n\nInflammation in the lungs has been shown to wake up dormant cancerous cells, which then develop into deadly tumours. Around one in 10 lung cancers are thought to be caused by air pollution in the UK.\n\nEven while in the womb, air pollution is even thought to alter how a developing baby's DNA is functioning during critical stages of development.\n\n\"There's a very sensitive period when air pollution can cause a problem and it undoubtedly does: small lungs, small heart and some problems with brain development,\" says Sir Stephen.\n\nAt the other end of life, components of air pollution seem to be \"accelerating the process\" of dementia, he says, by helping plaques of toxic proteins form inside the brain.\n\nThere is advice on how to minimise our exposure to air pollution - including walking on quieter side streets or keeping away from the edge of the road so you're further from traffic. This is especially important for babies in buggies, who are much closer to the height of exhaust pipes.\n\nGrigg's study showed a tight-fitting FFP2 mask led to less air pollution in the blood, but \"we're not saying that everyone should wear a mask\", says Grigg, adding some clinically vulnerable people including those \"recovering from a heart attack or have chronic respiratory disease\" might benefit while in areas of high pollution.\n\nBut the tricky thing with air pollution is you're often breathing in the pollution caused by other people. It is not easy to just live somewhere else if your house is on a busy road.\n\nChanges to cars – not just sales of electric vehicles, but emissions standards on newer diesel and petrol engines – are improving air quality.\n\nBut Grigg says: \"I think the more we understand the mechanisms of how it can cause these effects, the more we can add to the pressure for policy makers to reduce exposure - because that's the answer in the end.\"\n\nInside Health was produced by Tom Bonnett",

    "description": "Will the Seattle Seahawks of New England Patriots win Super Bowl 60? Our BBC Sport experts have their say plus you can make your pick.",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will fight it out in Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, but who will walk away with the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nSam Darnold can complete the ultimate redemption story if he guides the Seahawks to glory, and against the team he was famously \"seeing ghosts\" against during his struggles at the New York Jets.\n\nDrake Maye can become the youngest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl if he leads the Patriots to a record seventh ring - defeat though will leave them with the most losses ever in the NFL's big game.\n\nSo who will win? We've drafted in a panel of experts from our BBC show The Whole 10 Yards - presenter Hugh Ferris and analysts Phoebe Schecter and Phil McGeoghan to have their say.\n\nWe've also got Radio 5 Live presenters Mike White and Rob Staton along with BBC Sport journalists Paul Higham and Ben Collins.\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nWhere the Super Bowl will be won and lost\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 28-24 Patriots\n\nPredicting who is going to win the Super Bowl should be an exercise of head over heart, and yet the build-up tends to be dominated by narratives, not number-crunching. Well, I'm falling for it. The redemption story of Sam Darnold, plus the opportunity for the Seahawks to punch it in a little more successfully than they did against the same opponents at the end of Super Bowl XLIX is too good to ignore.\n\nDespite Seattle's number one defence, it's been their offence that has carried them through the close games in recent weeks, and Darnold's steady performance against the Rams' pass rush in the NFC title game (having struggled against the same team and players in the play-offs a year ago with the Vikings) makes me think he'll handle the Patriots, and the occasion. He might be seeing glory instead of ghosts this time.\n\nIf Seattle win with any offence whatsoever tell me a voter who won't lean into the idea of Darnold completing one of the great comebacks the NFL has ever seen, from draft bust to Super Bowl MVP.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 28-7 Patriots\n\nThis Seahawks defence has a lot to it and it feels like we haven't seen the best of Drake Maye in a lot of ways during the past two games. But you can see the attitude of this Seattle defence, they are ears back, aggressive, with great fundamentals and they take such pride in the little details.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 30-23 Patriots\n\nYou just don't understand the physicality that you're about to see from the Seahawks on Sunday. You know, I'm just telling you right now, it might not be close, right? This team is going to come out. We're going to be downhill running duo schemes inside zones. They're going to be going to take a deep shots down to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. But I love the tight-ends, what they're doing. I love the scheme. I love the continuity. But really the way Kenneth Walker's running with the football, he can catch fire in a heartbeat.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 28-20 New England\n\nThe Seahawks have been the most complete team this season and when one unit struggles, such as the defence in the NFC Championship, the offence tends to pick it up (and vice versa). They've proven they can outlast the better teams, including the Rams (twice), 49ers (twice), Jaguars, Texans and others.\n\nThe Patriots are brilliantly led by Mike Vrabel, their defence grew as the season went along and in Drake Maye they have an X-factor at quarterback. If the Seahawks don't get in their own way and avoid turnovers, they might just be too strong.\n\nI've gone for Darnold as MVP. Vrabel will likely dip into the Bill Belichick playbook to try and take away the main offensive threat, which is Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Darnold could look to use running back Kenneth Walker in the passing game, Rashid Shaheed downfield and expect Cooper Kupp to make a few plays. Darnold also had his best game of the season against the Rams to get his team to the Super Bowl. If he doesn't turn the ball over the Seahawks have a great chance to complete a glorious season with a championship.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 27-14 Patriots\n\nWe all love a good revenge game but this isn't Bill Belichick v Pete Carroll, Tom Brady v Russell Wilson or 'Beast Mode' v baffling goal-line playcalling and it's not the 2014 season anymore. What it is though is a redemption story for Sam Darnold.\n\nPerhaps his autobiography will be 'From Ghosts to Glory' after his infamous \"I'm seeing ghosts\" sideline comment in 2019 meeting (against the Patriots of all teams).\n\nHaving made it this far, it will haunt him forever if they don't finish the job. That said, I think Darnold exorcises a few demons by taking home the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nI was tempted to go for Jaxon Smith-Njigba and I think he could still get it but for JSN to have a big night, law of averages suggests Darnold will have played a significant role in that happening so I'll plump for the much more standard QB pick.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nSuper Bowl all-time record book\n\nPrediction Seahawks 17-20 Patriots\n\nSeattle have lost three games this season by a combined nine points, but somebody's got to back the Patriots haven't they? And underdogs have won four of the last five Super Bowls.\n\nI don't think they can win a shootout but I'm not expecting one with these two defences - I'd like them to strike first though as Seattle are 11-0 this season when the score first.\n\nListen, a dominant Seahawks win wouldn't surprise me, but I've just got a feeling Vrabel and Josh McDaniels with all their experience can pull something out of the bag.\n\nThe Pats are 12-0 and allowing just 14.5 points a game when defensive wrecking ball Milton Williams and shutdown corner Christian Gonzalez are on the field together, and they'll both play on Sunday.\n\nAnd if it's close going down the stretch then it only takes one play. Give me the Pats in a nailbiter.\n\nLet's face it, it's a quarterback award isn't it, but since I'm backing a low-scoring upset win I'll go for just the 10th defender to win the MVP. Von Miller was the last, in this very same stadium, wearing all white as well! Aside from the omens, Williams did have a couple of sacks and a forced fumble and recovery on Patrick Mahomes for the Eagles last year and something similar in a tight contest could be a difference maker.\n\nPrediction Seahawks 24-13 Patriots\n\nSeattle's awesome defence, known as the Dark Side, has been the main topic of discussion during Super Bowl week. Drake Maye has shown the ability to scramble and escape the pressure but I think the Seahawks will bring too much heat and stifle the Patriots quarterback.\n\nHe has already taken the second-most sacks in a single post-season (15) and I reckon Seattle will force him past Joe Burrow's record tally of 19.\n\nNew England's defence isn't too shabby either so I expect it to be a tight, low-scoring affair before Seattle go clear late in the third quarter or early in the fourth to clinch it.\n\nSome 17 Seattle players registered at least half a sack this season, with their interior defence particularly aggressive. Tackle Leonard Williams has registered eight sacks and 33 quarterback pressures so I'm backing the 13-year veteran to emerge from the Dark Side and become a rare defensive MVP.\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026?

    "description": "After Leeds' win over Nottingham Forest on Friday, BBC Sport looks at what it all means for the Premier League relegation battle.",
    "fullText": "One down, three to go for Leeds.\n\nBefore their crucial win against Nottingham Forest, boss Daniel Farke said he expected four more victories would seal his side's Premier League survival.\n\nFriday's dominant 3-1 triumph, thanks to goals from Jayden Bogle, Noah Okafor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, moved them nine points clear of the relegation zone and chalked one off.\n\nThey now sit on 29 points - already enough to survive in both of the past two seasons.\n\n\"It was a game with a bit more on the line,\" said Farke afterwards. \"It feels sometimes a bit more important than other games.\n\n\"To deliver in this way with such a spirited performance, it's sometimes more perfect than an easy 4-0 or 5-0. It was a massive performance.\"\n\nTheir advantage over the bottom three may be cut back to six points if West Ham win at Burnley in another huge game on Saturday, but little would dampen the mood at a sodden Elland Road.\n\nSo what does this result really mean for Leeds, Forest and the wider relegation picture?\n\nOnly three times have teams been relegated at the end of a 38-game Premier League season having been on at least 29 points at this stage.\n\nSunderland, who were on 29 points after 25 games finished 18th in 1996-97, while Ipswich and Birmingham City, who were on 30 in 2001-02 and 2010-11 respectively, also ended the season in 18th.\n\nOn average, the team finishing in 17th ends up on 38 points - and, just as Farke suggested pre-match, three more wins from their 13 remaining games would see Leeds get there.\n\nThings don't look too bad for Nottingham Forest either, though.\n\nOnly three teams have gone down at the end of a 38-game season after being on 26 points at this stage.\n\nOf the past nine teams who have been relegated, Leicester's 24 points in 2022-23 is the most any team who finished inside the bottom three had after 25 games.\n\nFollowing Friday's match, Opta predicts that Leeds have only a 4.75% chance of going down, with Forest on 10.24%.\n\nWest Ham are 83.88% likely to go down - although that could yet change after Saturday's game - while Burnley (98.35%) and Wolves (99.99%) appear to be all but down already.\n\nFarke seemed on the brink of losing his job earlier this season, but has overseen a stunning turnaround in his side's form.\n\nIt began when he opted to tear up the gameplan at Manchester City in November, reverting to a 3-5-2 formation with two up top and only being condemned to defeat after City scored a stoppage-time winner.\n\nThat result left them sitting inside the bottom three on goal difference, but their fortunes have markedly changed in the matches that have followed.\n\nLeeds have lost just two of their past 12 games and picked up 18 points.\n\n\"They've been on a great run since that Manchester City game way before Christmas,\" ex-Leeds midfielder Stuart Dallas said on Sky Sports.\n\n\"They had the change of shape, the change of formation and they've put a really good run together.\n\n\"They were excellent throughout the game [against Nottingham Forest] and it's a big win. Psychologically it is huge for them ahead of a weekend of big fixtures.\"\n\nForest, meanwhile, have won just two of their past nine Premier League games.\n\nCrucially, one of those was a 2-1 victory at West Ham last month, which kept the Hammers from moving one point behind.\n\nAnd, even when Nuno Espirito Santo's side beat Sunderland two weeks ago, Forest reacted with an impressive 2-0 win at Brentford 24 hours later.\n\nThose results were achieved, however, with a first-choice defence - and the absence of Matz Sels with a groin injury has been a huge loss too.\n\nIt was a gamble to replace last season's joint Golden Glove winner with John Victor in December and one which ultimately backfired, with Victor himself now also sidelined for the rest of the campaign.\n\nThat prompted Forest to bring in Stefan Ortega from Manchester City during the transfer window - but his debut against Leeds meant a defence which was so consistent last season was only changed further.\n\nZach Abbott was another debutant at Elland Road, the 19-year-old making his first Premier League appearance in the absence of injured defender Murillo.\n\nAbbott was targeted in the first half as Leeds seized on his inexperience - although Leeds' goals were ultimately down to a collective failure.\n\n\"We didn't get the injury news on Murillo until after training so we didn't get to work on anything else after that,\" said boss Sean Dyche.\n\n\"We just can't make basic errors like that. We didn't have a lot of time to work with the group at the back but we can't make basic errors.\n\n\"When we got here we were two points in the relegation zone and now we're six points out of it. I wasn't getting carried away beating Liverpool 3-0 and Tottenham 3-0 and people saying it was one of the best performances they've had in the Premier League.\n\n\"I knew if we won the work wasn't done. I look at if the work is done at the end of the season, not if we win or lose a game.\"\n\nThe full ramifications of yet another disappointing night for Nottingham Forest won't be known until Sunday evening.\n\nThe loss at Leeds will serve only to heighten concerns at the City Ground over the looming threat of relegation.\n\nWest Ham will cut Forest's cushion to three points with victory over Burnley on Saturday, while Crystal Palace and Tottenham can stretch their advantages over Dyche's side to six points by the time the weekend is out.\n\nYou wonder how the Forest hierarchy may react if the walls close in any more. Indeed, it is understood Dyche is under increasing pressure.\n\nLosing to a fellow relegation candidate in such a meek manner at Elland Road will not ease the internal scrutiny on Dyche's performance, with sources indicating support for the head coach isn't currently as solid as it has been.\n\nHaving already had three managers this season, it seems inconceivable that owner Evangelos Marinakis will seek a fourth head coach before the campaign is out.\n\nBut history tells us that the club's Greek owner has not been slow in making such decisions if he believes it is in Forest's best interests.\n\nThey now face bottom club Wolves on Wednesday at the City Ground. The home support will be expecting three points - but if Forest falter the pressure on Dyche will intensify.\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains why he thinks there is a negative reaction to British managers when they get jobs in the Premier League - and the path young coaches should take.",
    "fullText": "It has been interesting to witness the reaction of the media and some supporters at Chelsea over the past few weeks to the appointment of Liam Rosenior.\n\nBeing outside the game for a few years now, I have noticed a real trend of doubt and even negativity about any British managerial appointments by a top-flight club in this country.\n\nWith Liam, who I have known since he was a young player watching my training sessions at Bristol City more than 25 years ago, everything from his experience to his dress sense has been questioned, but his start to life at Chelsea has been exceptional with five wins in seven games.\n\nHis only defeats have come in both legs of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Arsenal.\n\nYes, that exit was a blow but let's remember Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has been in the job for more than six years and has produced, with some enormous financial backing and tremendous loyalty towards him by the club, a team that's one of - if not the best - in England and Europe.\n\nThat huge difference in their circumstances has not stopped Liam being criticised by some for his approach in those ties but he has spent almost a decade working his socks off to gain the experience that warrants this opportunity - and his experiences lower down the leagues and in Europe will have taught him the harshness of management and the reaction you get to every defeat.\n\nHis path is one I think more young British managers may need to pursue, in order to get a chance like he has.\n\nAs a former manager who worked at every professional level in England, you get to realise in the lower leagues what pressure you put yourself under, whether you are winning or losing.\n\nAlong with being able to ignore outside noise from the media outlets, one of my biggest assets was how I managed myself, on a day-to-day basis, and dealt with the stress of the job.\n\nLiam will need to do that tenfold at one of England's elite clubs, where scrutiny is so profound.\n\nLet's hope he gets the time and backing Arteta has received at Arsenal, because I believe it's vital to our national game that young British managers are given a chance by Premier League clubs, and if he succeeds then others can follow.\n\nThere are few other British bosses of any age in the Premier League at present - just six permanent bosses in total (far fewer than the number of 'home' managers in every other major league in Europe) - as well as Michael Carrick who is at Manchester United until the end of the season.\n\nOne of them, Eddie Howe, has proved at Newcastle without doubt that given, time and backing, British managers can be successful, and one day hopefully we will be applauding his appointment as the new England manager.\n\nAnd not far from Stamford Bridge, another young homegrown manager is showing his worth. Ireland's Keith Andrews was again not universally welcomed into the job at Brentford last summer, but just take a look at what he has achieved this season so far.\n\nIt is absolute necessary to our national game that, with the enormous amount of money spent, courses run and facilities produced, the young British or Irish coaches of today can relate to homegrown managers being successful at the top level, to give them the mentors to strive to follow and hopefully better.\n\nThe challenges today for coaches and players to do that are far greater, given that the Premier League is a world league.\n\nThis was never the case when I was growing up and then making my way as a manager. In the 1980s and 90s, English clubs were managed by British managers, Bob Paisley, Brian Clough, Alex Ferguson, Bobby Robson, Howard Kendall, Howard Wilkinson and George Graham. There were also great coaches like Don Howe and Dave Sexton too.\n\nAnd then there were the over-achievers like Bobby Gould at Wimbledon, John Sillett at Coventry and Lawrie McMenemy at Southampton, who all won the FA Cup with so-called smaller clubs.\n\nAt the same time, Martin O'Neill, Alan Curbishley and Peter Reid were breaking through, while John Toshack, Bobby Robson and Terry Venables were making new waves abroad. I apologise to the many other successful managers I haven't mentioned, but I only have so much room!\n\nAll these managers had different characters and approaches but what they have in common is that they were given the opportunity to prove their worth - something that is no longer the case for many British coaches and managers now.\n\nAt the end of the 1990's, Arsene Wenger, who was so prominent in opening the door to the influx of foreign managers in England, joined Arsenal.\n\nMany other top managers have followed - Mauricio Pochettino, Jose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola, Antonio Conte, Rafa Benitez and Claudio Ranieri are among the very best.\n\nThat in itself was purely a positive for our game and for myself personally too - I always believed in competition and to pit my wits against the above was a fantastic experience.\n\nThey were all fortunate to manage top clubs in England and become very successful doing it, while alongside these top managers arrived an array of fantastic players from all over the world.\n\nThe Premier League had more competition with managers arriving from abroad and also players coming in from all quarters of the world. It was imperative that the British coaches and players stepped up to the challenge, but right now it does not feel as if that is being allowed to happen.\n\nAlong with the success of foreign coaches came a belief that coaches from abroad were the only direction that owners - many of them being from abroad too - should go for.\n\nThis belief has, without a doubt affected the opportunities given to younger British coaches over the past decade and before, even if not all the foreign coaches arriving here matched the quality or success of the above.\n\nThe likes of Frank de Boer, Jacques Santini, Juande Ramos and Andre Villas Boas all struggled to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.\n\nMany more foreign coaches have arrived and brought with them tremendous success, but I do believe that our own young coaches given the opportunity could as Liam, Keith and Eddie have shown, be as successful given the chance - we should always judge managers on merit and not perception.\n\nAs I've mentioned in this column before, I always knew I wanted to stay in the game as a coach and manager after my playing days were over.\n\nI passed all my main coaching qualifications by the time I was 21, which allowed me to attend the managers and coaches' week at Lilleshall at the end of every season.\n\nIt was run by the Football Association, with regional coaches organising the programme for the week.\n\nNot only was I exposed to our elite coaches, but got to sit down and listen to the likes of Venables, Graham and Malcolm Allison talking over breakfast or dinner about the sessions being put on outdoors on the pitches.\n\nFor me, it was awe inspiring. These fantastic football people were devoted to the game we all love and I believed British coaches were at the top of the football world. They were fantastic mentors in so many ways.\n\nMy journey to eventually reaching the status of a Premier League manager started in the lower leagues, and I was fortunate to have been promoted out of every league.\n\nMy experience, my strengths and also my faults were all gained or worked on every week, in those surroundings.\n\nToday, academy football seems to be the new breeding ground for our young and up and coming coaches. Academy football is a great starting process on the ladder upwards, but I do believe these young coaches must experience the winning factor, outside of youth development and in lower league football.\n\nTo learn the difference, is imperative to their future success. Some outstanding managers played and coached in non-league and lower league surroundings and gained experience that was useful in more glamorous surroundings.\n\nJim Smith, Ron Atkinson, Dave Bassett and David Pleat, to name just a few, all earned their stripes lower down the leagues, before becoming top managers in England. It was the same more recently with Sam Allardyce, Harry Redknapp and Alan Pardew too.\n\nSome academy coaches have survived early baptisms when given their chances, but I believe the overall experiences lower down the pyramid cannot be matched.\n\nManaging in the academy is like shadow boxing, you don't get your supporters baying at you if you lose, you don't experience people above you questioning your selection or tactics, or players knocking your door about not playing or wanting to leave.\n\nI will always advise young players to get out and play in men's football if they can, because then you experience playing for a manager whose job is on the line if you don't play well, as well as paying crowds, criticism from the stands, the media and senior players.\n\nAcademy football can and does get bogged down with theory, when what these young coaches need is more practicality to understand real management situations.\n\nCoaching to develop is important, but when you are in the hot seat, no matter what level you are managing at, coaching to win is so much different.\n\nI really do hope that more British managers get opportunities to find that out in the Premier League and that gaining promotion out of the Championship will not be the only realistic route to achieving that dream.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "description": "BBC Sport reporter Emma Sanders takes fans' questions on the Women's Super League, the transfer window and the future of Alexia Putellas.",
    "fullText": "With transfer deadline day having passed, teams in the Women's Super League are embarking on their road to the end of the season.\n\nBBC Sport women's football news reporter Emma Sanders joined fans on Reddit to take questions on a range of topics, including how the window works, why Chelsea surprised her and the future of Spain superstar Alexia Putellas.\n\nHere is a selection of the questions and Emma's answers.\n\nQ. As a newcomer to women's football, I still don't know how/why only some transfer fees are released and also if they are real? Is the BBC provided with figures by agents, clubs, or other means?\n\nEmma: It's the biggest headache we have! Clubs do not release fees so we have to work very hard to get that information from our own sources. Some clubs can be helpful and confirm it off the record but we've had lots of scenarios where one club says one fee, and the other club completely contradicts it. If it were up to me, Fifa would release them all. I don't see the harm and it would offer transparency for fans to know where the club spends money. It's the fans' investment too, after all.\n\nQ. Have you ever been completely blindsided by a transfer? Like no-one had a clue the player might be moving until it was announced by the club?\n\nEmma: Definitely! There's not many of us who work full-time in women's football media – especially for national broadcasters and newspapers – so naturally, there's a lot to cover on our own. That makes it hard to keep track of every movement. To be fair, it happens less now that there are more covering the women's game - but I've definitely been blindsided in the past. Most of the time we get rumblings when a player might be moving, even if we do not have confirmation from enough sources or the name of the club they're moving to.\n\nQ. Have you heard the rumours of Alexia Putellas to London City Lionesses in the summer?\n\nEmma: I would say it's going to be a very interesting few months regarding Putellas. She can choose pretty much any club in the world and obviously can choose to stay at Barcelona too. The latest I've been told is that she's still deciding her next steps but there has definitely been a suggestion that WSL clubs are interested. London City Lionesses have the money and the ambition so I wouldn't rule them out.\n\nQ. Do you think it is curious that Chelsea were quiet?\n\nEmma: Very. They are out of the WSL title race, have injuries in the squad and clearly needed to add before the Champions League quarter-finals. I was disappointed.\n\nWhat's gone wrong for Chelsea in the WSL this season?\n\nOut of contract in the summer - so what next for these stars?\n\nQ. Any updates on Katie McCabe and Arsenal? Where would you like her to go?\n\nEmma: With McCabe's contract running out and no talks on a contract renewal, it has always been expected that she would leave in the summer. She has not decided her future but she's understandably got options. I think she's definitely still good enough to be playing Champions League football so I would like to see her stay in Europe, and preferably in the WSL. Manchester City would be a great fit but a controversial one I'm sure for fans.\n\nQ. Was there interest in [Arsenal midfielder] Victoria Pelova or a transfer request? I felt like if Georgia Stanway was about to get in, she would've been free to leave.\n\nEmma: Pelova is one of many we believe is out of contract this summer at Arsenal, so naturally her future is uncertain. I'm not aware of any transfer request but I would be surprised if she doesn't move. It's going to be a transition period for the club with the likes of Stanway and Ona Batlle on their list to bring in.\n\nThere's also been attention on Emily Fox, who Arsenal want to sign a longer-term contract. It was widely reported her deal was due to expire this summer; however, I've been told she may have an additional year on her existing contract. We believe she may be tied down to 2027, not 2026, as originally thought. That means the club would have longer to negotiate.\n\nQ. Just wondering if there's been any updates regarding Bunny Shaw's contract?\n\nEmma: It is something I am monitoring. The latest we were told was that the discussions were positive but it is a concern it's not been agreed. I would be surprised if she leaves.\n\nQ. Can you comment on Brighton's January window? Seemed like a very muted month. Are they happy with their squad? Also do you have any information about Fran Kirby and whether she was approached during the window?\n\nEmma: Personally, I think Brighton are short in forward positions and I would have liked to have seen them do more. They are very particular with their recruitment as it's led a lot by data. I think they may have missed out on one target, but I would expect a busy summer. A lot of clubs this season are bracing for that with it being a non-major tournament year in Europe. In terms of Kirby, Italian media reported that Juventus made bids. I don't know on that, but I do know Brighton would not have sold at any price in January.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "BBC Sport crunches the numbers to see if greater ambition in attack can secure England a Six Nations title.",
    "fullText": "England begin their Six Nations campaign against Wales on Saturday having won their past 11 matches and completed their first unbeaten four-Test autumn in nearly a decade.\n\nWith recent results driven by greater ambition in attack, BBC Sport examines whether England's firepower can prove decisive in their hunt for a first Six Nations title in six years.\n\nRewind to three years ago and England were effectively the worst attacking side in the top tier of Test rugby.\n\nSteve Borthwick had been appointed as head coach with just nine months to prepare for a Rugby World Cup and opted for a failsafe approach: kick high, long and often, and limit mistakes.\n\nThe reductive strategy so nearly secured successive World Cup finals - but often proved soporific for supporters.\n\nEngland's limitations were such that an Italy side which began 2023 ranked 12th in the world - lower than Samoa – still scored more tries across the calendar year, despite playing three fewer matches.\n\nEngland had not so much left the handbrake on as lost the keys to a car locked in the garage.\n\nThe following year, a transitional team lost seven of 12 Tests as they continued to tread water in attack.\n\nMiddling metrics. Fleeting momentum.\n\nIn 2025, England's attack evolved into something with verve and variety. Only back-to-back world champions South Africa scored more tries, while Opta data demonstrates a drastic improvement in comparison to every other Tier 1 nation.\n\nAnd England's new-found ambition underpinned a year of growth – winning a series in Argentina with a depleted squad and defeating New Zealand for just the ninth time in their 120-year rivalry as part of an unbeaten autumn.\n\nEngland's current run of 11 wins is their longest in nearly a decade.\n\nThose 2025 numbers may have been boosted by a record-breaking triumph against Wales last March but the same could be said for resounding wins by South Africa, New Zealand, France and Argentina against the same opponent – and England's attack still compares favourably over the past year.\n\nFormer Red Rose winger Chris Ashton believes the catalyst for change was England's fourth successive loss against Scotland, at Murrayfield in the 2024 Six Nations.\n\n\"Steve has a very pragmatic style and it's hard to convince him otherwise,\" said Ashton, who scored 20 tries in 44 caps for England between 2010 and 2019.\n\n\"Sometimes, losses show you where you're going wrong. That loss against Scotland was one-sided and showed we're not spending enough time on attack.\"\n\nThere have been annual gains since the Edinburgh defeat two years ago.\n\nUnder the guidance of Richard Wigglesworth, England's attack scored 25 tries in last year's Six Nations, the most the team have managed in a single campaign in almost a quarter of a century.\n\nAs well as the 10-try rout of Wales, they ran in four against eventual champions France and seven at home to Italy.\n\nLee Blackett - the mastermind of a Bath backline that scored an unrivalled 102 tries on their way to winning last year's Premiership - inherited that upward trajectory.\n\nSeconded for the tour of Argentina last summer with a brief to \"remould\" England's attack, a 2-0 series win followed, despite the absence of 15 senior players to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia.\n\nBlackett was then appointed attack coach permanently in September.\n\nA clean sweep of the autumn followed, including the exhilarating win against New Zealand.\n\nIn the early days of Borthwick's reign, attacking platforms were often wasted by an inaccurate, even hopeful kick. England were statistically the worst of all Tier 1 sides at turning clear opportunities into tries, converting just 28% of their chances.\n\nHowever, in 2025, only South Africa and France were more effective at scoring from a line-break, with England's completion rate rising to 43%.\n\n\"(Blackett) is really good at giving players confidence to take risks,\" said Ashton. \"You need a coach who's encouraging you to score tries.\"\n\nThe statement victory against New Zealand also underlined England's enhanced ability to seize the biggest moments.\n\nIn 2024, they lost all three meetings with the All Blacks despite leading each one heading into the final quarter.\n\nBut at Twickenham two months ago, England responded to an opening salvo of 12 unanswered points to take control of the game - a hold they did not relinquish in the latter stages despite losing influential back-row Ben Earl to a yellow card on 65 minutes.\n\nIt was the ultimate vindication of England's destructive \"Pom Squad\" bench and followed wins against France, Scotland and Argentina earlier last year when England were either losing, or level, after an hour.\n\n\"Accuracy\" may be a beloved buzzword of elite coaches, but the data shows a clear improvement in how England handle the closing stages of Test rugby.\n\n\"Against New Zealand it was close but in the final quarter they took the game away from them,\" said Ashton.\n\n\"It was a massive moment in terms of development and mindset of the players. They're now trying to go on and win those matches late on, not just survive.\"\n\nThere does, however, remain a Springbok in the room. England have defeated France, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina over the past 12 months but will not face the world's most formidable defence until this summer.\n\nTheir development will instead be tested when they begin their Six Nations campaign by hosting Wales on Saturday before a round two Calcutta Cup clash in Scotland.\n\nEngland's preparations have been disrupted by an increasing number of injuries in the front row but Borthwick still named 11 Lions in his matchday squad to take on Wales.\n\nThe side is otherwise settled – no debuts were awarded in November, the first time that has happened in an autumn series for England in 26 years.\n\nEngland, though, have not won at Murrayfield since 2020 – the last time they went on to become Six Nations champions – while they travel to Paris in round five having not triumphed on French soil in a decade.\n\nBut Ashton believes strength in depth can help sustain title ambitions for a side who have finished fourth, third and second over the past three years.\n\n\"All the signs say England could win it this year,\" said the former Saracens winger.\n\n\"Scotland didn't get the autumn wins they may have wanted, Ireland have injuries and an older squad.\n\n\"France are dangerous but England are in a confident place.\"\n\nAnd such confidence stems from developing different ways to win.\n\nKicking remains an integral part of the Borthwick battleplan – along with most Test teams – but it is no longer a means to simply mitigate risk.\n\nEngland are more prepared to play wide and vary their passing game, built on the rediscovery of a physical edge.\n\nUtilising ball carriers like Earl and wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso in threatening areas, England's gainline success - a metric that indicates how effective the ball-carrying team is at knocking back defenders - has improved significantly.\n\nIn 2023, their success rate was just 58%, ranking England sixth in Tier 1. In 2025, it was 65% - second only to hard-hitting South Africa (66%).\n\nThey also gained more metres per carry (4.3m) than every other Tier 1 team last year.\n\nAs a result, they have scored more tries, beaten more defenders and completed more offloads than at any time under Borthwick.\n\n\"England are in as good a spot as you could possibly be even with some injuries up front,\" added Ashton.\n\n\"They've won games in different ways which is also key – you can't just have one way of playing against any given team.\n\n\"We want to start the Six Nations well, give the lads a lot of confidence and get some tries, too.\"",

The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nThe NFL's influence can be seen in the Premier League through the kind of choreographed corner routines that are now commonplace, and Apollo can understand why Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has shared ideas with Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay.\n\nApollo told BBC Sport: \"While football is quite a free-flowing game you do have these set-pieces and if you need some inspiration of how to make things happen then the NFL is a good place to look at, because that's what they do all day every day - not just on offence but on defence as well.\n\n\"What you are always trying to get in the NFL is mismatches, and that's exactly the same in football for some of the big guys coming in and trying to put the ball in the back of the net with a header or whatever.\n\n\"The level of detail that goes into that in the NFL is incredible. I remember my days there in training camp would start with breakfast at 7.30am and some days you wouldn't leave the meeting rooms until 11pm.\n\n\"We were only on the field for two hours max and in the gym for another hour, and the rest would be meetings and analysis.\n\n\"The scrutiny on every individual is so high so I can see why other sports would look at that and try to implement it themselves to find some weakness in the opposition armour. Arteta must have been thinking it is a way to help his team win games.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Apollo - aka Alex Gray - were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.\n\nI am at this game and we are getting to the stage where it really matters how the teams fighting relegation do in their head-to-head-battles like this.\n\nI think the bottom two, Wolves and Burnley are down, but you don't know what West Ham will do from here.\n\nThere are signs they may click, so with Leeds and Nottingham Forest both on 26 points, this is big for both of them.\n\nFrom a Leeds point of view, their home form has carried them a lot this season.\n\nThey got walloped at Elland Road by Arsenal last weekend but they just have to put that behind them for this game because, as the season has gone on, they have proved they can be competitive.\n\nForest's away form is actually better than their home form - they have picked up 14 points on the road compared to 12 at the City Ground, in the same number of games.\n\nSean Dyche's side were comfortable with 10 men in the draw against Crystal Palace last time out and they have won their past two away games, against Brentford and the Hammers. Overall, they are unbeaten in four league games, which is the longest they have gone without losing all season.\n\nAs you can see, I've looked into all the stats for you - but will my research help me get my prediction right? Probably not.\n\nThis is going to be a very tight affair and Forest won't worry about having much possession, but scoring goals has been a bigger problem for them because they have missed Chris Wood badly - only Wolves have scored fewer than them.\n\nForest have brought in 6ft 7in striker Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli to try to fill the gap left by Wood's long-term knee injury but he has not been in great form in Serie A this season.\n\nSo, after a great deal of thought, I am going to back Leeds at home - although now I've said that it will probably end up as a 1-1 draw.\n\nApollo's prediction: When I looked at the fixtures I was thinking about who in the Gladiators supports who. Two of the guys, Giant and Hammer, are big Forest fans so I am going for a Leeds win here. It should be a good game though. 3-2\n\nManchester United were slightly fortunate to beat Fulham last time out. A draw would have been about right.\n\nStill, it was big for Benjamin Sesko to get their winner and I have got to say he put it away very nicely, especially because he should have scored with a header earlier in the game.\n\nTottenham, meanwhile, produced a great comeback against Manchester City. I've talked about how much I rate Dominic Solanke and when he is up for Spurs, they are in a much better place as a team.\n\nThere is a danger of getting carried away with United under Michael Carrick, and I am expecting Solanke to score again here, but it still feels like United will find a way to win it.\n\nApollo's prediction: Tottenham have an affinity with the NFL and I've been to a couple of games there so I am backing them here. 0-1\n\nLosing back-to-back home league games against Everton and Brentford has been a real killer for Aston Villa, who have so many injuries to contend with in their midfield.\n\nAfter a long wait for a win, Bournemouth have now won three of their past four league games - and I make them favourites at home here.\n\nVilla thumped the Cherries 4-0 at Villa Park in November, and I have got a lot of their players in my Fantasy team, but this is going to be a very different game.\n\nI've gone for 2-1 wins in my first two games and I don't really want to go for that scoreline again here, but I feel like I have no choice. I do think Villa will score - Morgan Rogers is always dangerous and Tammy Abraham is a clever signing up front - but Bournemouth will edge it.\n\nApollo's prediction: It's great for Villa to be in a title race. 1-2\n\nI am not going to say 2-1 for this one. Instead it will be another Arsenal clean sheet - they have already kept 12 in their first 24 league games, two more than any other team.\n\nIt's a shame Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka is not fit to face his old club at the Emirates. When he played for the Black Cats against Arsenal in their draw at the Stadium of Light, they were the first team I saw who really rattled the Gunners.\n\nXhaka's experience has helped to glue together a Sunderland side with a lot of young players this season, but they coped all right without him against Burnley on Monday.\n\nThis is a much tougher game for them, obviously, and Sunderland's away form is nowhere near as strong as it is at home.\n\nArsenal swept Leeds aside 4-0 last weekend, when everyone thought they were having a bit of a blip.\n\nThey showed their strength in depth at Elland Road, when they lost Bukayo Saka in the warm-up, and I can see them winning comfortably this time too.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is very easy for me because Legend and Fire both support Arsenal and are real die-hard fans - Legend even has a cannon tattoo - so being absolutely honest I would love Sunderland to win, and do it for the north-east! 0-2\n\nI think Burnley are down but this is their chance to prove me wrong.\n\nThey need it to be - they are at home, against a team one place above them in the table, so this is their big chance to end their long wait for a win.\n\nI just don't see it happening for the Clarets, though.\n\nAs I said earlier, I am not sure which West Ham side will turn up but they have shown some improvement recently, especially in attack.\n\nI don't think the Hammers will keep a clean sheet because they have had only one all season - the fewest by any top-flight team - but I don't see Burnley beating them.\n\nApollo's prediction: My cousins are lifelong Burnley fans and season-ticket holders so if I didn't back them here, I'd be in a lot of trouble. The former NFL player, JJ Watt, is a co-owner of the club too, so for the NFL links and family ties, it's got to be a home win. 2-1\n\nEverton asked about Fulham forward Harry Wilson on deadline day.\n\nHe has been a revelation this season and they won't be looking forward to facing him on Saturday.\n\nThe Toffees have got something after falling behind in their past three league games, including the last-gasp equaliser against Brighton that saw poor David Moyes booked for his celebration - there is no way you should get a yellow card for that.\n\nThis is going to be another close game and it smells of another 2-1 to me, but I am not going to go down that road again this week.\n\nInstead, I'm going for a different scoreline but sticking with a narrow Fulham win. Marco Silva will feel his side deserved something from Old Trafford and it will be him celebrating at the final whistle this week, not Moyes.\n\nApollo's prediction: We don't like draws in the NFL but this might up all-square. 1-1\n\nChelsea were accused of being too negative in their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal in midweek, but I can't see that being the case here.\n\nI was far too optimistic about Wolves last week when I said they would draw with Bournemouth and I am not making the same mistake this time.\n\nThe games have been coming thick and fast for Chelsea and I actually admire their manager Liam Rosenior for the way he changed things up in their 3-2 comeback win over West Ham after being 2-0 down.\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards has probably got one eye on preparing for next season in the Championship, and his side will be one step nearer to that after this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: I went to a couple of Chelsea games when I lived in London and they will get the job done here. 1-2\n\nYou just wonder how much Newcastle have got left in the tank after their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat at Manchester City on Wednesday.\n\nThe Magpies have a few injuries to contend with too, with Anthony Gordon the latest player to be sidelined, so they will have to dig deep and hope Bruno Guimaraes is back fit in time for this game.\n\nBrentford got one heck of a win last time out at Villa, and their manager Keith Andrews deserves a lot of credit for getting that result despite being down to 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nThe Bees are always so well organised at the back, and how Eddie Howe's side try to break them down will be the key to this one.\n\nAs good as Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade is with his back to goal, he doesn't run in behind.\n\nDoing that, and attacking with pace, is how Eddie Howe's side look the most dangerous - Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga will have to do that here, and I fancy Yoane Wissa to score against his former club.\n\nApollo on why he supports Newcastle: I am from a small town in County Durham - my grandmother went to school with Sir Bobby Robson - so I had the choice of Newcastle, Sunderland or Middlesbrough. I know it is absolute blasphemy to say this, but I like to see all the north-east clubs do well.\n\nNewcastle are my team though, because that's who I went to watch first - I went to see them against Ipswich in 2000, and Alan Shearer scored a couple - and it is my city as well. I played rugby for them and I lived there. It's a fantastic place and it's even better when the team is going well.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is going to be a Newcastle win, it's just a case of how much. Brentford's performance coach Ben Ryan used to coach me for England Sevens, then he went to Fiji and got a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, so it would be nice to get one over him as well. 3-1\n\nPalace have brought in Jorgen Strand Larsen, and kept Jean-Philippe Mateta, so Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has got some options up front.\n\nI normally predict a draw in this game, and it ended up 0-0 at Selhurst Park in November. This time, though, I fancy Brighton.\n\nThe Seagulls didn't quite get over the line against Everton, but them conceding late on actually won me some points. I am going for them to keep a clean sheet here though.\n\nApollo's prediction: Palace to edge it. 0-1\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola starts with Omar Marmoush up front ahead of Erling Haaland after his two goals against Newcastle in midweek, but their attack looks strong anyway with Rayan Cherki and Antoine Semenyo in the team.\n\nThe same applies to Liverpool, who have got a striker in form in Hugo Ekitike, while Florian Wirtz is playing with confidence too.\n\nCity will have moments where they will create chances, but Liverpool are going to have opportunities at the other end as well - there will be a few goals in this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is the 'Super Bowl' game of the weekend in the Premier League so I've gone for an NFL-type score as well as a football one. 22-31 (2-3)\n\nSuper Bowl, Levi's Stadium 23:30 GMT\n\nI haven't got a clue about the NFL and I never played gridiron - my nose would be too big and would stick out of the helmet - but I am going for the Seahawks to down the Patriots on Sunday.\n\nSeattle is a really nice place and I played in their stadium for Celtic, so they get my backing here... although that's probably bad news for them, going by how I've done at predictions this season.\n\nApollo's prediction: The Seahawks' defensive coordinator, Aden Durde, was part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program that took me to Atlanta. If he gets a Super Bowl, it would be the biggest accomplishment from someone from Britain in the NFL. 21-18\n\nFor the second successive week, the outcome went to the final game.\n\nChris, the BBC readers and AI were all level on 80 points going into Monday's match between Sunderland and Burnley, with his guest - boxer Francesca Hennessy - on 40 points.\n\nChris and Francesca went for a 1-0 Black Cats victory, the BBC readers thought they would win 2-0, while AI picked a 1-1 draw.\n\nSunderland were 2-0 up after 32 minutes but the BBC readers' hopes of an outright win were scuppered when Chemsdine Talbi scored their third goal, 18 minutes from time.\n\nThat meant Chris and the BBC readers tied for victory - they both managed six correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 matches in week 24, for a total of 90 points.\n\nAI managed five correct results with one correct score for a tally of 80 points, while Francesca also managed five correct results but with no exact scores, leaving her on 50 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Newcastle's goalkeeper on this day 15 years ago - the day of the famous 4-4 draw with Arsenal - was Steve Harper, who told BBC Radio Newcastle his recollections of the match.\n\n\"I can't believe it was 15 years ago. I'll never forget it because my youngest was 12 days old so I remember thinking during the first half 'this is the first and last Newcastle game he'll ever come to when I'm playing'.\n\n\"After Chris Hughton, who was popular with the players and fanbase, was dismissed and Andy Carroll left the club in recent months, the dark clouds were circling and were then amplified over the course of the first 45 minutes.\n\n\"We were 2-0 down after three minutes. We just needed to take a breath and get a foothold in the game, but they were relentless.\n\n\"We were 3-0 down after 10 and in shock. When we go 4-0 down after 26 minutes, I remember lying on my back and thinking 'we need half-time now'.\n\n\"I went in and said if any of you so-and-sos wave the white flag I'm going to be the first goalkeeper in Premier League history to let 10 goals in.\n\n\"Alan Pardew, we didn't see eye to eye, but he came in and he was brilliant and said 'Look lads, you need a response, the crowd need to see a response, you need to respond for each other. Your family and friends are in the crowd, what are they going to be thinking?'\n\n\"I thought it was really good because it's not a time to start ranting and raving and turning players on themselves.\n\n\"Kevin [Nolan] refereed the game without the referee knowing. He was an intimidating character who was streetwise. He knew if we tried to play football it would be six or seven - what we needed to do was the dark arts, get competitive and be horrible, which we were in promotion from the Championship.\"\n\nOn Cheick Tiote's equaliser: \"I had the ultimate view. It was perfect, on his weaker foot. Never seen him do anything like it. It had a clear path and I knew it was in.\n\n\"The noise. In 33 years of being in and around St James' Park I've never heard anything like it. Tiote runs the length of the pitch and I ran towards the celebrations and elbowed Leon Best in the hamstring and he has to go off! Maybe we would have won the game if I hadn't.\n\n\"You just do mad things. People still talk about it to this day.\"\n\nCome back later today for fan accounts and more players who featured in the fixture\n\nSend us your memories of the game here\n\nListen to BBC Radio Newcastle's special coverage looking back on the day",

    "description": "Hassan Ishaq is beginning his boxing career with just two fights under his belt. BBC Sport speaks to his team the \"delicate\" task of building a prospect.",
    "fullText": "\"I'd rather fight than do interviews.\"\n\nThis short, sharp sentence tells you everything you need to know about Hassan Ishaq.\n\nIn an era of influencer boxing, where manufactured social media feuds can outshine the sport itself, the 22-year-old super-bantamweight from Slough has little interest in clout or cameras.\n\n\"I'm not used to the spotlight. I just love the sweet science of boxing,\" he tells BBC Sport.\n\nMastering the art of self-promotion will come in time but, for now, Ishaq is backed by a team determined to ensure his talent does not go unnoticed.\n\nFrank Warren, a promoter who has navigated the shark-infested waters of British boxing for 45 years, is guiding Ishaq's first steps in the paid ranks. And in trainer Huzaifah Iqbal, he has a voice outside the ropes - a hype man, strategist and mentor rolled into one.\n\n\"Hassan's going to be pound-for-pound one of the world's best,\" says a beaming Iqbal.\n\n\"A multi-weight world champion like Manny Pacquiao, inshallah. One day, we'll have Michael Buffer introducing Hassan and listing all the belts in all the divisions.\"\n\n5 Live Boxing: Kelly becomes champion as Big Baby loses his lid\n\n'Spooky premonitions' drive unfancied Kelly to top of boxing mountain\n\nEdwards to fight Powar for British title on BBC\n\nTalent, belief and dedication can take a fighter far but making smart decisions early on will determine the height of Ishaq's ceiling.\n\nIqbal describes the transition from amateur to professional as a \"delicate\" stage, where careers are often made or broken.\n\n\"The first five or six fights are the real transition,\" he says. \"The work Hassan does in the gym now - and with the sparring partners we bring in – is more important than later.\n\n\"As you get older, your muscles become cemented. It's harder to change.\"\n\nCrucially, Iqbal believes the trainer must be involved when it comes to match-making, making sure opponents aid development rather than simply pad a record.\n\n\"Boxing is a messed-up sport. Sometimes managers who have never boxed find opponents,\" he says.\n\n\"But it should be the coach, because the coach knows the fighter's strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\nEven the sport's greats needed learning nights. Pacquiao's first three bouts went to points. In his second pro fight, Floyd Mayweather went the four-round distance with awkward southpaw Reggie Sanders and had to deal with a cut in the third.\n\n\"We want opponents who make Hassan show what he can do. Who can test his grit and take his power. Hassan can box with both hands and we want someone who throws something back so he can slip, counter and whack.\" Iqbal adds.\n\n\"We have to remember he's only 22 but if he continues to keep pushing and learning, he will go all the way.\"\n\nIshaq will be searching for a third consecutive stoppage win on the undercard of featherweight Nick Ball's world title defence against Brandon Figueroa in Liverpool on Saturday.\n\nA three-time England national champion and gold medallist at the prestigious Haringey Box Cup, he boasts strong amateur pedigree.\n\nSuch is the buzz around him that the end of his amateur career was marked with a celebration event in London which included messages of encouragement from heavyweight titan Anthony Joshua and unbeaten middleweight star Hamzah Sheeraz.\n\nYet for all his amateur success, Ishaq never considered staying on to chase Olympic glory.\n\n\"I had about 50 fights and won about 40,\" he says. \"But I felt like in the amateurs, I used to get robbed a lot. Decisions never went my way and it disheartened me.\"\n\nThat disillusionment led him to the professional ranks. Nicknamed 'Shooter', Ishaq describes himself as a \"thinker\" rather than a brawler.\n\n\"I'll be a world champion within five years, 100%. I know what I'm capable of,\" he says, his quiet manner not to be mistaken for a lack of ambition.\n\nIshaq fights out of the New Era Gym in Surrey under Iqbal, one of the sport's brightest young coaches.\n\nA former professional himself, Iqbal won his lone bout in 2019 before serving a lengthy apprenticeship under the tutelage of world-class coach Adam Booth.\n\nWelterweight world champion Lewis Crocker has recently joined Iqbal's stable and the trainer says the IBF belt-holder is one of many \"elite fighters who turn their necks when Hassan is sparring\".\n\nIqbal points to the 'Philly Shell' - the shoulder-roll defence popularised by Mayweather - as the foundation of Ishaq's game.\n\nPhilly Shell is a high-IQ style built around making opponents miss by inches and punishing the mistake.\n\n\"A lot of Philly Shell fighters are purely counter-punchers and aren't very aggressive,\" Iqbal explains.\n\n\"But Hassan trusts his power. He has that defensive mindset but he can switch to offence at any moment. That's what makes him stand out.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "It may be just 19 months since India lifted the T20 World Cup in Barbados but the latest edition begins in Colombo on Saturday.\n\nAs ever, the tournament in India and Sri Lanka will likely be one of sixes and runs.\n\nBefore it all begins, we have taken a look at what has been going on in international and franchise games over recent years and predicted some trends and tactics to watch out for...\n\nThe option for a team to call in a batter who is struggling and chewing up too many balls has always been there.\n\n2025 was the year retiring batters out hit the mainstream.\n\nThere were 26 instances of that 'dismissal' in international and domestic T20s last year - almost 50% of the total number in the history of the format.\n\nIt has also happened twice more since the turn of the year in the Big Bash, while Northern Districts retired out two batters in the same innings in New Zealand's Super Smash in January.\n\nA batter has retired out in a T20 World Cup before - in a match involving England no less - when Namibia batter Nikolaas Davin walked off to allow David Wiese to come to the middle in the 2024 group stage.\n\nBut with the stigma around the move gone, could this be the tournament of the retired out?\n\nNot since 2013 have spinners bowled as much at the death in T20s as they did in 2025.\n\nFor a long while, the death overs - regarded as the last five in an innings for this data - have been left largely to seamers and their mix of yorkers, slower balls and hard lengths. That is changing.\n\nIn 2025, 24% of balls bowled at the death in T20s between full member nations were delivered by spinners - and with some success.\n\nSpinners' economy rate at the death has dropped around 1.5 runs per over in the past two years to 7.68 runs per over. Last year, spinners had a better economy at the finish than seamers.\n\nAfghanistan, unsurprisingly given the quality of their options, have used spin regularly at the death. More than half of their deliveries in the final five overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nIndia were the next most frequent users of the tactic, followed by Sri Lanka and, interestingly, England.\n\nWhile England captain and when leading Northern Superchargers in The Hundred since 2024, Harry Brook has had spinners bowling 42.2% of his deliveries at the death.\n\nFormer captain Jos Buttler's figure in that time was just 19.7%.\n\nThis may be less of a surprise, given fast scoring and six-hitting has been on an upward trajectory since T20's inception.\n\nLast year was a big jump, however, with batting strike-rates for all players in all men's T20s tipping over 130 for the first time. The increase from 2024 was more than eight runs per 100 balls.\n\nThe introduction of the Indian Premier League's player impact rule has boosted scoring rates there - teams effectively can field an extra batter when needed - but the rise is reflected in internationals too.\n\nA six was also hit every 17.4 deliveries across all T20s last year - the figure was at 23.1 as recently as 2021.\n\nSixes are now hit more than twice as often than in the format's first year in 2003.\n\nWe are all familiar with the term match-up these days.\n\nIt has become commonplace in T20 - and increasingly in Test cricket - and describes how some batters are suited to styles of bowling and vice-versa.\n\nWhen it comes to batting against spin, the logic goes that batters are more vulnerable when facing a bowler who turns the ball away from them - a leg-spinner to right-handers and off-spinner to left-handers.\n\nWhat is interesting, however, is how all of those at the top of the T20 batting rankings, bar Australia's openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head as shown below, all have strong records against their perceived negative spin match-up.\n\nIndia's left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma, the world's leading T20 batter, averages 43.3 and strikes at 183.1 runs per 100 balls against off-spin in internationals since the start of 2024.\n\nEngland right-handers Phil Salt and Buttler have strike-rates of 148.4 and 136.8 respectively against left-arm spin alongside solid averages.\n\nThe trend is reflected by the leading spin bowlers too. India's Varun Chakravarthy, Rashid Khan and Adil Rashid all have similar records against right and left-handers.\n\nWhen it gets to the elite level, match-ups are not insignificant but they are not the be all and end all.\n\nAnother thing on the rise is the prevalence of left-handed batters.\n\nIn T20s between full member nations, lefties have never faced a higher percentages of deliveries than the 35% they did in 2025.\n\nThe spike is a sign of some teams switching on to the benefits of right-hand-left-hand batting combinations.\n\nIt makes shorter boundaries harder to defend, messes with bowlers' lengths and negates the threat of those spinning match-ups.\n\nAnd no team uses this more than co-hosts and overwhelming favourites India. It has been a cornerstone of Gautam Gambhir's time as coach.\n\nSince the start of 2024, left-handers have faced 51% of India's deliveries in T20s against full members - a jump from 31% under Rahul Dravid in the run up to the 2024 World Cup.\n\nEngland, in comparison, twice picked a team with only one left-hander in their XI during the tour of India last year.\n\nBut while left-handers only faced 19% of England's deliveries from the start of 2024 to the start of 2026, the selection of Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran for this World Cup - all of whom could bat in the top seven - suggests times may, belatedly, be changing.\n\nBut if England are to have any chance in India and Sri Lanka, it feels like Salt and Buttler, their two leading batters, will have to hit form.\n\nAfter Buttler's period at number three, the pair were reunited as openers at the end of last summer and, despite a quiet run for Salt in Sri Lanka, have returned impressive results.\n\nSalt hit scores of 141 not out, 85 and 89 against South Africa and Ireland. Buttler also made 83 against South Africa when an opening stand of 126 sent England on their way to a record 304-2.\n\nSalt, a notoriously aggressive starter, cuts loose from the start, striking at 149.7 in the first two overs of T20s since the start of 2024 - the third best of any opener at this World Cup.\n\nButtler, in comparison, has a strike-rate of just 105 in that time. He sits back and watches Salt do his thing.\n\nBut by the final two overs of the powerplay Buttler is often flying.\n\nThe former captain, having taken a bit of time to get in, has been striking at 172.9 in the fifth and sixth overs, even outdoing Salt's healthy strike-rate of 163.7.\n\nThe pair take on the powerplay in specific and complementary ways.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and  if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "description": "BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team explains what is behind the tensions at the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "The men's T20 World Cup starts on Saturday against a backdrop of political tension.\n\nThe tournament, which features 20 teams, will be held in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nBangladesh are boycotting it after a request for their fixtures to be switched from India to Sri Lanka was refused by the sport's governing body.\n\nTheir place in Group C has been taken by Scotland.\n\nPakistan had considered boycotting but have since confirmed they will take part, though will not play their scheduled match against India.\n\nBangladesh had asked for their games to be switched from India, citing safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nRelations between the South Asian neighbours have soured since former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.\n\nIndia has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, and violent protests broke out after Sharif Osman Hadi - a prominent student leader in Bangladesh - was shot dead.\n\nIndia itself has raised concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nIn December, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in an incident that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman in January after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\n\nIn response, Bangladeshi authorities banned broadcasts of the IPL in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board then requested that their World Cup fixtures be played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - rejected that request, saying there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\" and gave the BCB a final 24 hours in which to declare their participation.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Scotland were invited to the tournament.\n\nThe ICC said it was keen not to establish \"precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events\".\n\nPakistan are boycotting their match against India, which was scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 15 February.\n\nIn a statement, the Pakistan government said it granted \"approval\" to the team's participation in the tournament but they \"shall not take to the field\" for the match against India.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi previously said the team could pull out completely after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament.\n\nPakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, and India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.\n\nPakistan did not host any touring nations between 2009 and 2019 following the Lahore attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, which killed six policemen and two civilians.\n\nPakistani players have also been banned from the IPL since 2009 following the Mumbai attacks that left 174 people - including nine gunmen - dead.\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and eventually played their matches in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt resulted in the two nations signing an agreement stating the two countries would play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.\n\nThe neighbours have fought a number of wars and had several military stand-offs since the partition of India in 1947, when the nation was split into India and the new state of Pakistan. It created an upsurge of violence, in which approximately 15 million people were displaced and an estimated one million died.\n\nRecent escalations were sparked after the neighbours engaged in a four-day military conflict in April 2025 following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC said Pakistan's stance was \"difficult to reconcile\" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\".\n\nThe governing body said that \"selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions\".\n\nIt said it \"respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy\" but continued: \"This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan.\"\n\nIt added it hoped the PCB would \"consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country\".\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is among those who have accused the ICC of mishandling the situation.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: \"It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but I stand behind my government's decision.\n\n\"This is the moment for the ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member.\"\n\nMatches between Pakistan and India can draw huge TV audiences.\n\nReportedly, more than 600 million people watched last year's Champions Trophy fixture on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar.\n\nThe ICC has not published its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face.\n\nHowever, the rules for the previous tournament stated: \"If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as match conceded or match awarded, as the case may be.\"\n\nIt is assumed India will be awarded two points for a win and Pakistan's net run-rate will also be hit by the forfeiture.\n\nPakistan face the Netherlands, USA and Namibia in their other group-stage games, and it is unclear what could happen if they were to face India in the final.\n\nTeams have pulled out of tournament fixtures before, with Australia and the West Indies both deciding not to travel to Colombo in the 1996 World Cup that was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nEngland also decided not to play their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns and social unrest in the country.\n\nNone of those nations received a subsequent fine or punishment from the ICC, though all forfeited the matches.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Bangladesh could receive other sanctions as the ICC has a precedent for punishing governments who interfere in the game.\n\nUnder article 2.4 of the ICC constitution, it outlines boards must manage their affairs \"autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of cricket\".\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe were suspended for three months after the government replaced the cricket board, leading to a freeze on funding and exclusion from World Cup qualifiers.\n\nFour years later, Sri Lanka also lost the right to host the Under-19 World Cup after its government dismissed the national board following poor performances.\n\nBoth nations later had their ICC membership restored.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?",

    "description": "BBC Sport finds evidence raising questions over the neutral eligibility of four Russian athletes.",
    "fullText": "Several Russian athletes approved to compete as neutrals at the Winter Olympics have links to activity supporting the war in Ukraine, according to evidence seen by BBC Sport.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has cleared 13 competitors, external from Russia to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Milan-Cortina.\n\nTheir eligibility was assessed by a three-person IOC panel, external, with athletes deemed ineligible if they were found to have actively supported the war, including through social media activity or participation in pro-war events.\n\nHowever, material shared with the BBC by the Molfar Intelligence Institute, external and investigative journalist Artem Khudolieiev raises questions over whether some of those approved meet the IOC's broadly-framed criteria.\n\nMeanwhile, one member of the panel - Morinari Watanabe - was filmed embracing a Russian gymnast sanctioned for his involvement with Russia's war effort during a visit to Moscow in March, prompting further questions about the vetting process.\n\nUkraine's flag-bearer for the opening ceremony believes the IOC should review its neutral eligibility framework.\n\n\"Getting ready for competition in occupied territories, or supporting the war on social media, it is definitely not right to call them neutral because they're not,\" said skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych.\n\nThe IOC said it could not comment on individual cases but that the panel had \"reviewed the athletes in accordance with the executive board decision and the principles it had established\".\n\nRussians and Belarusians cleared for Winter Olympics\n\n'Russians & Belarusians should compete in qualifiers'\n\nBBC Sport has verified the following evidence relating to four individuals cleared to compete as neutrals:\n\nPetr Gumennik (figure skating) - Gumennik has recently worked with and been coached by Ilya Averbukh, who has been sanctioned by Ukraine, external. Averbukh has held the role of 'Crimea's ambassador for sport', taken part in events in numerous occupied territories and staged performances for families of Russian soldiers.\n\nSavelii Korostelev (cross-country skiing) - Korostelev liked pro-Putin and pro-military content posted on Instagram by fellow skier Veronika Stepanova. He was also described as a \"private\" and an \"army skier\" in a 2023 article published by his club, CSKA, which is affiliated with the Russian armed forces.\n\nKseniia Korzhova (speed skating) - Korzhova liked pro-war content on Instagram from gymnast Nikita Nagorny, who has been sanctioned by the UK, external and European Union, external for his prominent role with the Russian army.\n\nDariya Nepryaeva (cross-country skiing) - Nepryaeva attended a ski team training camp in Crimea in 2022, months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 and is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The camp was filmed and broadcast by a state-backed television channel.\n\nUkraine's Olympic Committee has written to the IOC to raise concerns about Gumennik and Korzhova.\n\nNone of the athletes named responded to BBC Sport's requests for comment.\n\nRussia's Sports Minister, Mikhail Degtyarev, has previously said that \"athletes are not responsible for relations between countries or for governmental decisions and according to the Olympic Charter they should have the right to compete\".\n\nSeparate reporting, external has suggested that Korostelev may have been completing compulsory military service, rather than voluntarily joining the army.\n\nThe final decision on whether the four athletes could compete in Milan-Cortina was taken by the IOC's Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel.\n\nWatanabe sits on the panel as the representative of international sports federations, by virtue of his role as president of World Gymnastics. He was also a candidate in last year's IOC presidential election.\n\nIn March 2025, Watanabe was filmed embracing Nagorny during a visit to Moscow.\n\nNagorny, an Olympic gold medallist at the Tokyo Games, has been a prominent supporter of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nHe served as head of Yunarmiya, Russia's youth military organisation, between 2020 and 2024 and has been sanctioned by the UK, European Union and United States, external.\n\nThe UK sanctions notice accuses Nagorny of involvement in the forced deportation and re-education of Ukrainian children.\n\n\"It’s crazy,\" said Heraskevych, who held up a ‘No War’ sign at the Beijing Games.\n\n\"He's still hugging this person and still friendly with him. And then he decides whether these Russians are guilty or not guilty, whether they are engaged in the war or not.\"\n\nWorld Gymnastics, responding on behalf of Watanabe, said it would not comment on the IOC panel or its decisions.\n\nIt said Watanabe's visit to Russia \"took place a few days after he visited Ukraine\" and that its purpose \"was to show support to athletes affected by the war, on both sides\".\n\n\"Mr Nagorny has not been allowed to participate in World Gymnastics competitions since the beginning of the conflict,\" it added.\n\nDuring Watanabe's tenure as head of World Gymnastics, Russian athletes have also been allowed to return to international competition under neutral status in his sport.\n\nThat includes Angelina Melnikova, who was controversially cleared to compete last year despite previously posing with the pro-war 'Z' symbol and standing in local elections for Vladimir Putin's United Russia party.\n\nWorld Gymnastics said decisions regarding its Individual Neutral Athlete status are made \"by an independent ad hoc committee, following background checks conducted by an external company\".\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began just four days after the end of the last Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAt those Games, 209 Russians competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) because of sanctions linked to a state-sponsored doping scandal. They finished second in the medal table, winning 32 medals including five gold.\n\nSince the invasion, athletes holding Russian or Belarusian passports have been barred from many international sports competitions.\n\nBut the IOC has created a pathway for individuals to compete as neutrals, provided they meet strict criteria.\n\nThat framework was first applied at Paris 2024, where 32 competitors from Russia and Belarus took part as AINs.\n\nTo be eligible, they had to show they had not actively supported the war and were not contracted to the military. They competed without national flags or anthems.\n\nThe same conditions apply in Milan-Cortina. Thirteen Russians and seven Belarusians have been approved across eight sports. Team events such as ice hockey and curling remain off limits.\n\nThe IOC says every neutral competitor must also be cleared by their international federation.\n\nSome bodies, including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), attempted to exclude neutrals altogether but that position was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in December, a ruling that came too late for many athletes to qualify.",

    "description": "Scotland players tell BBC Sport their mental health suffered after they were told their contracts would end following the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland left the pitch following their gutsy 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat by England, for some of the squad it was a moment of pride that marked how far the team had come.\n\nFor others the full-time whistle signalled the end of an emotionally damaging tournament from which some say they are still struggling to recover.\n\nReaching the last eight was the team's best performance at a World Cup in 23 years.\n\nHowever, players have since told BBC Sport that behind the scenes Scottish Rugby's management of player contracts before the tournament left them in \"probably the worst case of mental health\" they had ever had, with one saying she suffered a breakdown as a result.\n\n\"I had an actual real-life breakdown in club to one of my coaches,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been put on medication for depression because of the impact that it's had on me.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I came back from the World Cup in a hole, a shell of myself.\"\n\nIn response, Scottish Rugby said the union was \"aware of the potential challenges players faced in their mental health during this time\" and that a package of support was put in place.\n\n\"We would not question the personal experience of an individual athlete,\" the union's response continued.\n\n\"We would, however, dispute the lack of care referenced.\"\n\nBBC Sport spoke to four players involved in the World Cup and one who was in the wider Scotland training squad. Contributors wished to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardising their future in the sport.\n\nPlayers said their contracts were due for renewal in June 2025, two months before the World Cup began in August, and that they had asked for 12-month deals beyond that to ensure job security and so they could focus on their performances at the tournament.\n\nHowever, according to those contacted, while some players in Scotland's 32-player World Cup squad were given 12-month contracts in May 2025, a quarter were told their deals would end in October, a decision one player described as a \"big shock\".\n\nAt the time, contracts ranged from £18,000 to £27,000 and in most cases were the player's main source of income. Those playing in the Premiership could also earn up to about £10,000 from their club contracts.\n\nThe players who spoke to BBC Sport said that having to compete at the World Cup knowing their jobs and international careers were potentially about to come to an end put them under huge mental strain.\n\nThey also said they were not given the proper support by Scottish Rugby to cope with the situation.\n\nSome of those who were told they would lose their funding after October had been part of the Scotland team for many years and were regularly starting international matches.\n\nOne said that \"despite clear signs\" that some were suffering with the news, \"no transitional help\" was offered by Scottish Rugby.\n\nAnother said she spent downtime between World Cup matches searching for a job.\n\nIn 2025 Scottish Rugby said it would increase the number of contracts available to players from 32 to 35 for the 2025-26 season.\n\nOne player said \"everybody understands contracts aren't going to be guaranteed every year\", before questioning why Scottish Rugby did not provide access to career advisors or psychologists for those affected.\n\nAnother added: \"It's not about contracts. It's not about resources. It's literally about treating people like human beings.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response stated that psychological support was embedded in Scotland camps and available to all players regardless of contract status.\n\nIt said a player development manager supported players on off-field matters, including employment, and that exit meetings were held at the end of contracts to identify any potential physical or psychological support that may be needed.\n\nAsked if she felt Scottish Rugby had failed in its duty of care to players, one player responded \"without a doubt\" and referenced the death of international Siobhan Cattigan aged 26 in 2021.\n\n\"How many people need to die before you take it seriously?\" she added, addressing Scottish Rugby. \"You've clearly not learned.\"\n\nCattigan's family said undetected rugby-related brain damage caused a \"catastrophic decline\" in her health and led to her death.\n\nIn 2023 Scottish Rugby said it \"let down\" Cattigan's family and chairman John McGuigan apologised \"wholeheartedly for any anguish we caused Siobhan during her time with Scottish Rugby\".\n\nMcGuigan added at the time: \"We have listened and heeded the lessons and, in Siobhan's memory, commit to making changes to ensure we are a better organisation in the future.\"\n\nAnother player said the communication of selection decisions left her \"unbelievably unwell\", adding: \"There are loads of harsh realities of elite sport: injury and non-selection. How you manage people is more important than ever.\n\n\"You can't treat people like they're just disposable, regardless of the elite sport wheel being a forever turning one.\n\n\"We still need to have empathy. And I just didn't feel like there was much at all.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response to this story said: \"We are very uncomfortable with this comparison to Siobhan's own tragic situation and the inference in any way that we were negligent in our support to her.\"\n\nPlayers told BBC Sport that the squad discussed boycotting one match during the 2025 Women's Six Nations - five months before the World Cup began - to try to reach a resolution with Scottish Rugby on its request for 12-month contracts.\n\nAll the players contacted say they were told contract decisions were based on performance and that they may still get a new contract should they perform well at the tournament, adding further pressure.\n\n\"It literally was a do or die lifeline,\" one player said.\n\n\"It's like I need to do everything I can on this rugby pitch, otherwise I'm not going to have a job and I'm going to struggle to pay my rent.\n\n\"When you're not sleeping, you don't have an appetite. You're just miserable most of the day. It's really hard to then put in a performance or do yourself justice.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response said that players were told \"on a number of occasions that their standalone playing performance at the World cup was not the sole criteria for any possible change to their contract situation\".\n\nTold her contract would end in October, one player said she was on job search websites \"most nights\" during the tournament looking for jobs \"that were appropriate\" for her life as a club rugby player.\n\nShe said: \"Before you even started a job, you're trying to bargain and speak with a new employer and be like, 'Can I finish at this time?' Because I have to actually go to my other job [club rugby training].\n\n\"Then I'm going to come in tired in the morning because I've not got into bed until midnight.\"\n\nPlayers no longer on contracts can still represent Scotland, but they now fall under the country's National Team Agreement, which offers them £75 a day, not including rest days, for attending Scotland training camps.\n\nOne player said \"she can't be involved\" for that amount, adding: \"I won't be able to afford to pay my mortgage.\"\n\nAnother player said concerns over her future took \"an emotional toll\", adding: \"I didn't want to be there. I look back on it with exhaustion. It was such a big opportunity but I have nothing but negative thoughts around it.\n\n\"[After the tournament] I removed myself from social settings, any settings where people could ask me loads about rugby.\n\n\"If I did get into that environment, I would try to remove myself as quickly as possible because it made me panic and stress.\"\n\nThe player said Scotland Rugby had not been in contact about any follow-up support.\n\n\"There's been no kind of input about, 'do you need psychology?' or anything like that,\" she said.\n\nScottish Rugby detailed the steps put in place to support players:\n\nAccess to clinical psychology and a player development manager.\n\nA mandatory medical exit meeting to \"identify any potential physical or psychological support\".\n\nAn independent HR exit interview and a six-week post-contract window to access \"exit support services\" if needed.\n\nScottish Rugby said: \"From the outset of this process we recognised that players - particularly those whose contracts were due to end - would need additional support during the Rugby World Cup period and in planning their next steps.\n\n\"We believe we did deliver on our duty of care by the provision of both psychological and career guidance support throughout 2025, including in the lead-up to and during, the RWC.\n\n\"The entire playing group were out of contract in June 2025 and we made the decision to extend all contracts through to the end of October 2025 to provide a degree of stability through the RWC itself.\n\n\"The timings involved were designed to give clarity to all players as early as possible, following a timeline agreed and requested by the players themselves.\"\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at Manchester City's evolution and why the January window has offered renewed belief.",
    "fullText": "The January transfer window has heralded encouragement at Manchester City.\n\nNot necessarily because Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi have strengthened their squad, but more that the marquee acquisitions show City are maintaining their powerbase in the transfer market.\n\nThe mere thought of transition can be enough to strike fear into any football club, particularly one that has been as successful as City in recent years.\n\nOld habits die hard when winning becomes the norm, but sometimes key decisions are taken out of your hands.\n\nAt the Etihad Stadium, there are clear signs of evolution.\n\nOn the pitch, a host of new players have arrived, while stalwarts Kevin de Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Ederson have left. In the executive team, long-serving sporting director Txiki Begiristain has departed and handed the reins to Hugo Viana.\n\nThen there's manager Pep Guardiola and the growing uncertainty over his future.\n\nIn attracting players, City have leaned heavily on the unique selling point of working with Guardiola. They can still use his aura to their advantage - but no longer to the same extent.\n\nHere, BBC Sport looks at the club's evolution and why the January window has offered renewed belief at City that change and ambiguity over their manager's future won't derail their efforts to deliver success.\n\nWhen Guardiola signed a new two-year contract in November 2024, the perceived doomsday scenario of his departure at the end of that season was prevented.\n\nAt the time, the club's greatest ever manager had just over six months left on his contract. Now there is no such urgency, with 18 months left on his deal.\n\nBut that doesn't tell the full story.\n\nThe football industry has been rife with speculation over Guardiola's future, though City's perspective is talk of him departing this year is just that - speculation.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it would be City's preference for him to stay for as long as possible. The 55-year-old continues to publicly insist he loves working at the club, and has shown no clear outward indication he is preparing to leave.\n\nBut sources have told BBC Sport there is tangible uncertainty over whether Guardiola will see out the final year of his contract.\n\nThe expectation is a decision on whether he stays will be made towards - or after - the end of this season.\n\nAnd if Guardiola does stay, it is seen as improbable that he will renew his contract.\n\nIt is fair, then, to deduce we are likely to be at the beginning of the end of his trophy-laden tenure in the blue half of Manchester.\n\nWhether that moment comes in six or 18 months remains to be seen.\n\nSemenyo and Guehi entered negotiations with their eyes open.\n\nBoth had the Premier League's elite to choose from last month.\n\nSemenyo was a target for Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham. Liverpool, too, were credited with an interest in the 26-year-old, who had a £65m release clause at Bournemouth. He prioritised a move to City.\n\nGuehi was admired on an even greater scale. Out of contract at Crystal Palace at the end of this season, the England defender had suitors across Europe.\n\nBayern Munich, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid had serious interest in signing him on a free transfer at the end of the season, while Real Madrid and Barcelona were also in the running. Liverpool's interest was well-documented. Arsenal and Tottenham also tried to convince him to agree to move across London this summer.\n\nIt is inconceivable either player decided to sign a long-term contract without knowing it is likely the majority of that time will be spent under a manager who isn't Guardiola.\n\nOf course, the opportunity to work for him - even if it is for six months - is one most players aren't afforded. But that alone is unlikely to have been enough to compel Semenyo and Guehi to sign five-and-a-half-year deals.\n\nCity can no longer lean heavily on the idea of flourishing under Guardiola in their pitches to players.\n\nAccording to sources, rival club executives have used the emerging narrative over the managerial situation to persuade players to ignore advances from the Blues - as if to suggest their success will wane once Guardiola is gone.\n\nNevertheless - certainly for Semenyo and Guehi - City's pitch remains among the most competitive around, despite the uncertainty over Guardiola.\n\nThere is no escaping the fact they are one of the best payers in Europe, and it would be disingenuous to suggest finances weren't a big factor in the two new signings.\n\nThat said, it is understood Tottenham's offer to Semenyo was the most lucrative he received last month.\n\nIndeed, sources close to both transfers say it was City demonstrating they gave a virtual guarantee of competing for the biggest trophies and consistent Champions League qualification that proved pivotal in the decision-making process.\n\nTheir state-of-the-art infrastructure and off-field ambitions are key features of their pitch to new players, but ultimately it centres on on-field success.\n\nThey impress on prospective signings the world-class squad already assembled, combined with their commitment to continue recruiting elite players.\n\nTheir strategy of extending the contracts of their best talent in search of continuity and stability also features prominently in their pitch - the 10-year contract striker Erling Haaland signed last year a case in point.\n\nBut it is City's body of work under their Abu Dhabi ownership - even prior to Guardiola's arrival - that is their truly unique selling point for prospective signings.\n\nThe trophies speak for themselves.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't some uncertainties. The implications of City's prolonged legal battle over the much-documented 115 charges in relation to alleged Premier League financial rule breaches weighs heavily over the Etihad. The club strongly deny any wrongdoing.\n\nThe outcome of the case will resonate, and any punishment may alter the landscape of English football and City's history.\n\nWhile no-one knows where the case is up to, the rebuild City have carried out over the past year suggests they are not actively preparing for the worst.\n\nRegardless of what lies ahead in that respect, they will continue to prepare the football operation for success way beyond when Guardiola is gone.\n\nFor those at City, the arrivals of Semenyo and Guehi have provided tangible proof their recruitment operations are not dependent on Guardiola's employment.\n\nAmid the ongoing changes, there remains a key constant at City.\n\nChairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak is the club's agenda-setter. The idea the Spanish triumvirate of Guardiola, Begiristain and Ferran Soriano - the club's CEO - ran the show in the absence of a distant Al Mubarak is a false narrative.\n\nHe has been, and remains, at the heart of City's operation. No big decisions are made without his input.\n\nTo that end, Al Mubarak will be at the centre of the process to appoint Guardiola's eventual replacement. Viana will lead the search - a task that will unquestionably be his most significant since his appointment as Begiristain's replacement was confirmed in October 2024.\n\nFor the successful candidate, replacing Guardiola will be an unenviable task.\n\nThat said, replacing Begiristain may have been just as daunting for Viana given his predecessor's reputation as one of the leading player-trading executives in world football.\n\nWith that in mind, those at City will tell you the move to keep Begiristain to conduct what was effectively a six-month handover to Viana until the summer of 2025 was crucial in the Portuguese's ability to hit the ground running.\n\nAccording to sources, Begiristain hand-picked Viana as his successor - a dynamic that eased the transition.\n\nThat Ruben Amorim - as manager of Manchester United - was also in town helped.\n\nThe pair - and their wives - grew close during their time working together at Sporting Lisbon, where Viana and Amorim had become two of the most sought-after non-playing commodities in European football.\n\nViana's track record at Sporting was excellent. Alongside Amorim, who he appointed, the 43-year-old helped transform them from a team stuck in malaise into one of the most dynamic in European football.\n\nThe signings of Viktor Gyokeres, Morten Hjulmand and Pedro Porro were viewed in recruitment circles as among the most economically sound.\n\nHe also sold Porro, Matheus Nunes, Joao Palhinha, Nuno Mendes and Manuel Ugarte for combined fees of more than 200m euros (£170m).\n\nOf course, City are a different beast.\n\nBegiristain and Viana worked in tandem during the 2025 January window in signing Nico Gonzalez, Abdukodir Khusanov and Omar Marmoush - something seen as hugely important in Viana's development.\n\nSimilarly, the groundwork for City's £20m capture of Guehi was started by Begiristain but executed by Viana, who is asserting his authority and personality on the club.\n\nBegiristain, Guardiola and Soriano are very close, but Viana is forging relationships with the latter two - and they are already said to be on a strong footing.\n\nThose who have worked under both Viana and Begiristain speak of similarities between them: they are unassuming in their demeanour but diligent and structured in the way they operate.\n\n\"There is a plan for everything,\" said a source.\n\nAgents have also spoken positively of their dealings with Viana, describing him as straightforward and courteous.\n\nViana is now two transfer windows into the rebuild of City's squad.\n\nDe Bruyne, Ederson and Walker all departed on his watch, and fellow stalwarts John Stones and Bernardo Silva could leave when their contracts expire in the summer.\n\nThere is uncertainty, too, over the future of Nathan Ake - and the same could be said for Manuel Akanji, Jack Grealish and Kalvin Phillips, who are all out on loan.\n\nIt is gearing up to be a busy summer window for Viana, something made trickier by it being a World Cup year.\n\nLast summer, he didn't have it all his own way. City had genuine interest in Florian Wirtz, who eventually went to Liverpool, but felt compelled to drop out of the running for the German over the total cost of the deal.\n\nWhile City maintain it was their decision, the fact they didn't sign Wirtz was felt deeply given how highly they rated the player.\n\nViana pivoted to a more economical option - Rayan Cherki, who has been a bright spark in City's season.\n\nWirtz appears to be finding his feet in England, but City will argue Cherki has had the more impressive campaign so far.\n\nThe signings of goalkeepers Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford - after Ederson's departure - were two key acquisitions, with the former's arrival seen as particularly important. Tijjani Reijnders and full-back Rayan Ait-Nouri were also important arrivals.\n\nViana will now target a new central midfielder, with Nottingham Forest's Elliott Anderson among the primary targets.\n\nThey will want further defensive reinforcements too should Stones and Ake depart, though there remain high hopes for central defender Vitor Reis - on loan at sister club Girona - with the expectation he will be integrated into City's senior squad in the not-too-distant future.\n\nWith Viana at the controls, City's transition is in full swing - and their ambitions are no longer contingent on the presence of their iconic manager.\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "With excitement rising for this year's Stade de France curtain-raiser against Ireland, BBC Sport NI looks at how France are shaping up for their Six Nations title defence.",
    "fullText": "France are the Six Nations holders. Inspirational captain Antoine Dupont is fit. They possess a beefy pack and backline of phenomenal speed and creativity. Three of their games are at home.\n\nSuch factors help explain why Les Bleus are, for many, clear favourites to defend their title and possibly lay down a marker 18 months out from the World Cup.\n\nBut much like Thursday's opponents Ireland, their preparations for the tournament have been far from serene.\n\nWith the teams named and excitement for this year's Stade de France curtain-raiser rising, BBC Sport NI looks at how France are shaping up for the latest chapter in their enthralling rivalry with Ireland and the tournament as a whole.\n\nIreland start Loughman but Lowe and Furlong out\n\n'No panic' over Ireland's injury list - Sheehan\n\nWhat impact might 'unprecedented' Six Nations schedule have?\n\nHead coach Fabien Galthie has some of the finest rugby players on the planet at his disposal, but much of the spotlight in recent weeks has been fixed on established names who will not be lining out in the French capital on Thursday.\n\nGalthie caused a stir last month when he revealed a 42-man squad without Gregory Alldritt, Gael Fickou and Damian Penaud.\n\nAll three have been big players in the Test arena in recent years.\n\nPenaud's national record haul of 40 tries in 59 caps includes four against Ireland, and while there are question marks over his defensive capabilities, it is hard to reckon with the fact that the insatiable try-scoring appetite that has often lit up the Six Nations is not currently a part of the French armoury.\n\nThe upside for France is that, with Penaud out, Theo Attissogbe starts on the right wing. The jet-heeled 21-year-old has had an injury-hit season with Pau, but he scored three tries in two Six Nations outings last year.\n\nElectrifying left winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey has scored 18 tries in 17 games this season, so even without Penaud's finishing prowess, France will be typically deadly out wide.\n\nFickou's absence robs France of a 98-cap veteran, but Galthie has a wealth of options in midfield. Bordeaux pair Yoram Moefana and Nicolas Depoortere, who start against Ireland, are 25 and 23 respectively, while Toulouse's Kalvin Gourgues is a hugely exciting option to have in reserve.\n\nGiven that Alldritt stepped in as captain for the injured Dupont last year, his absence was particularly striking. Anthony Jelonch profits from Alldritt's absence. He has not started a Six Nations game in three years and has not started at eight for France since the 2023 World Cup.\n\nBeyond the three notable omissions, Galthie is without lock Thibaud Flament, who misses Thursday's game because it clashes with his wife's fertility treatment, and veteran prop Uini Atonio, who was forced to retire with a heart problem.\n\nWith no Atonio, Galthie has turned to Dorian Aldegheri, whose solitary Six Nations start prior to Thursday came against England three years ago.\n\n\"France have an issue at prop, especially at tight-head,\" said French rugby expert Paul Eddison.\n\n\"We obviously had the shocking news about Uini Atonio and it will be interesting to see how they replace him.\n\n\"He was incredibly popular in the squad. Regis Montange started in the autumn, Tevita Tatafu was seen as the next guy coming through but has had serious injury problems. It's an area teams may look to exploit.\"\n\nIreland have a similar issue up front. Loose-heads Andrew Porter, Paddy McCarthy and Jack Boyle are all missing, while tight-head Tadhg Furlong was not risked for Thursday's opener, paving the way for a new-look front row of Jeremy Loughman, Dan Sheehan and Thomas Clarkson.\n\nWith Romain Ntamack injured, Galthie has selected Matthieu Jalibert at fly-half alongside Dupont, who returns to Test rugby after injuring his knee against Ireland last year.\n\nIt is only the second time they have been paired together from the start since the 2023 World Cup (the other being a 26-25 loss to England last year), although Dupont's Olympic commitments and injury troubles have been obstacles to progressing the partnership.\n\nJalibert has been outstanding for Bordeaux this season but he hasn't always had the easiest relationship with Galthie. In November 2024, he refused a spot on the bench after Thomas Ramos was picked at 10 against New Zealand.\n\nLast year, Jalibert was dropped after France's loss to England and did not feature in the final three Six Nations games, but his performances for the European champions this season have made overlooking him impossible.\n\n\"It's interesting with Jalibert. He's ridiculously talented and on his day is up there with the best attacking players in the world, but he and Galthie haven't always seen eye to eye,\" says Eddison.\n\n\"There's been a question in France about how to get the best out of Dupont and Jalibert together.\n\n\"I think it can work. Dupont has the all-round game, so there shouldn't really be an issue with who he is playing with. It's just important to make sure Jalibert gets plenty of ball in hand.\n\n\"There are people who think Jalibert hasn't quite done it at international level, but this is his time to shine. When he's playing well, he's a joy to watch and that can make France an even more formidable team.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old centre has broken into the Toulouse team this season, scoring eight tries in 14 games. He made his France debut off the bench against Australia in November and is on the bench for the Ireland game. Last year, he underwent surgery for a blood clot issue in his foot but now looks primed for the big stage.\n\n\"He's looked unplayable this season,\" says Eddison.\n\n\"Ball in hand he is lightning fast. He can play 10, 12, 13 or 15. He's going to be amazing.\"\n\nAlso on the bench is the 22-year-old back row who captained France to victory in the 2023 Under-20 World Championship and who already has 68 Montpellier appearances under his belt.\n\n\"Shaun Edwards has recently been speaking about how good he's been. They've been impressed with him and keen to get him involved,\" said Eddison.\n\nAnother star of the 2023 Under-20s, Depoortere has scored 14 tries in 18 games for Bordeaux and France this season. He starts alongside Bordeaux team-mate Yoram Moefana in midfield.\n\n\"A silky runner. He's been scoring tries for fun and has been playing alongside Moefana every week, so I'd expect to see a lot of him,\" said Eddison.\n\n\"This could be the year when everyone realises just how good he is.\"\n\nListen to The Ireland Rugby Social's Six Nations preview\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "fullText": "Around 2,900 athletes from more than 90 countries will compete on the ice and snow at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nThe world's biggest winter sports stars will descend on northern Italy from Friday 6 February and there's certain to be thrills, drama and breakout performances.\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the global stars and stories to look out for.\n\nJust five days before the women's downhill event takes place in Cortina, Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn announced that she had ruptured her left anterior cruciate ligament but is still hopeful that she can compete on Sunday.\n\nVonn was airlifted to hospital in Switzerland after crashing in the final World Cup race of the season but remains determined to compete in her fifth Olympics, despite the serious injury.\n\nThe veteran skier is no stranger to a comeback having retired in 2019 because of injury before undergoing partial replacement knee surgery on her right knee and returning to the sport in 2024.\n\nThe four-time overall World Cup winner is unsure whether she will be able to compete in the super-G and team events but, as a heavy favourite for the downhill gold before suffering the injury, she is determined to make the start gate at what will likely be her last Olympics.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin is the greatest alpine skier of all time and, competing at her fourth Olympics, has said she wants to \"make peace\" with the Games following disappointment in Beijing along with serious injury and mental health struggles.\n\nThe five-time overall World Cup winner has 108 World Cup wins, securing victory in the opening five slalom events of the season which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\nBut the two-time Olympic champion will be targeting a return to the podium in Cortina while her fiance Aleksander Aamodt Kilde is also on the comeback trail from a bad injury.\n\nAmerican figure skater Maxim Naumov's participation in the Milan-Cortina Games could be emotional as he makes his Olympic debut after his parents were killed in a plane crash in Washington DC last year.\n\nNaumov's dream to make Team USA was one of the last things he spoke about with his parents before they were killed.\n\nHis parents, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, skated for Russia and were world champions in pairs figure skating in 1994.\n\nSki mountaineering, or 'skimo', is making its Olympic debut at Milan-Cortina and, while Great Britain have failed to qualify an athlete in the Games' new sport, France's Emily Harrop is the next best thing.\n\nWith English parents, Harrop could have competed for Team GB but having relocated to the French Alps as a child she opted to represent France.\n\nHarrop is well placed for an Olympic medal having finished the 2025 season with seven wins out of seven races at the ski mountaineering World Cup, winning the sprint and overall crystal globe for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nDutch speed skater Jutta Leerdam will compete in the 1,000m and 500m in Milan.\n\nA former world sprint champion, Leerdam also won a silver medal in the 1,000m at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.\n\nShe is also engaged to YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, who can often be spotted at competitions and will be cheering her on from the sidelines in Italy.\n\nTeenager Finley Melville Ives arrives in Italy as one of the most exciting prospects on the freestyle skiing circuit.\n\nIves' parents are both snowboard instructors and his twin brother followed in their footsteps, but Ives opted instead for skis from a young age.\n\nHis breakout season came last year when he claimed his first World Cup victory in Calgary then weeks later became the halfpipe world champion in Engadin, Switzerland, beating Olympic greats Alex Ferreira and Nick Goepper along the way.\n\nBorn and raised in California, freestyle skier Eileen Gu was China's poster girl for Beijing 2022, where - aged 18 - she won gold in the big air and freeski halfpipe competitions and silver in the slopestyle.\n\nIn addition to her Olympic triumphs, she is also a two-time world champion and three-time Winter X Games champion.\n\nAway from the snow, Gu is one of the most famous winter sports athletes in the world and has modelled in New York, Barcelona, Paris and at Milan Fashion Week while also studying quantum physics at Stanford University.\n\nFor the first time since Sochi 2014, the National Hockey League is permitting its athletes to participate in the Winter Olympics.\n\nNHL stars did not travel to the 2018 or 2022 Games because of financial disputes and pandemic-related complications but will return to the ice this year.\n\nIn their absence, the last two men's titles have been won by Olympic teams from Russia and Finland while the United States failed to win a medal at both events, but this could be a huge boost to their hopes of returning to the podium.\n\nEight years after winning gold as a 17-year-old in Pyeongchang, American halfpipe snowboarder Chloe Kim is going for a three-peat in Italy.\n\nShe successfully defended her title in Beijing four years ago but her preparations for Milan-Cortina have been disrupted after she dislocated her shoulder at the beginning of the year.\n\nShe said in an update on Instagram she was \"good to go\" for the Games, where she will aim to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe.\n\nLegendary German bobsleigh pilot Francesco Friedrich arrives in Italy hoping to become the first man do the treble double - winning two and four-man gold for the third Games in a row.\n\nHe is a 16-time world champion across the two and four-man events while he has well over 100 World Cup podium finishes, claiming a 50th victory in the two-man earlier this year.\n\nGermany tend to dominate the Olympic bobsleigh events and the question is whether anyone can stop him from making history.\n\nCompeting at her sixth Games, Arianna Fontana is an 11-time Winter Olympic medallist and has won medals at her five previous appearances - including as a 15-year-old in Turin.\n\nTwenty years later, the short track skater is also aiming to compete in long track speed skating.\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion Fontana will also be one of Italy's flag bearers at the opening ceremony at the San Siro.\n\nNorwegian-born skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen could make history in Italy by winning a first Winter Olympics medal for a South American country after he switched allegiance to compete for his mother's home country of Brazil.\n\nThe slalom and giant slalom expert retired in 2023 having competed for Norway but returned in 2025 to represent Brazil and became the first Brazilian to finish on a World Cup podium last year before claiming the country's first victory this season to add to his five for Norway.\n\nA charismatic and deep-thinking character, Braathen says that people don't believe him when he tells them he represents Brazil in alpine skiing.\n\nAge: 18 Nation: Independent Neutral Athlete\n\nRussian skater Adeliia Petrosian is one of around 20 Russian or Belarusian athletes competing under a neutral flag in Italy.\n\nThe teenager had not competed internationally at senior level until the Olympic qualifiers because of the ban on Russian athletes but is a genuine medal contender having won the qualifying event.\n\nShe is coached by the controversial Eteri Tutberidze, who coached Kamila Valieva during the Beijing 2022 Olympics. Valieva was given a four-year ban for doping after she helped Russia to win team gold before it was then revealed she had failed a drug test before the start of the Games.\n\nIlia Malinin is the only skater to have successfully landed the quadruple Axel, skating's most difficult jump, in competition, earning him the nickname the 'Quad God'.\n\nThe American, born to Olympic figure skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, is the hot favourite for the men's singles title in Italy with previous routines including seven quads and a back flip.\n\nThe reigning world champion will be competing at his first Olympics having controversially been left out of the US team in Beijing.",

    "fullText": "The Women's Super League winter transfer window closed on Tuesday - but which club did the best business?\n\nLeague-leaders Manchester City made a statement signing, reigning champions Chelsea had a quiet one and it was a busy month for struggling West Ham and Liverpool.\n\nWe asked former internationals Steph Houghton, Ellen White, Karen Bardsley and Jen Beattie for their opinions - and you can rate each club's dealings too.\n\nEvery WSL winter window transfer\n\nWSL: Latest updates as winter transfer window set to close\n\nSitting 11 points clear at the top of the WSL, Manchester City could not have hoped for much more at this point in the season.\n\nThe club's first WSL trophy since 2016 is well within their reach but the £600,000 addition of United States midfielder Sam Coffey from Portland Thorns will give Andree Jeglertz's side an extra boost going into the final eight games of the season.\n\n\"Coffey is a very shrewd signing,\" said former City captain Houghton. \"She has international experience and is a more defensive-minded midfielder, which City didn't really have.\"\n\nAny faint hopes Chelsea had of overhauling City to claim a seventh straight title have not been helped by the lack of recruitment this month, although Houghton was not surprised.\n\n\"Chelsea have got a really good squad already,\" she said. \"They've built one for the future and have experienced players as well. It's just at this moment in time they haven't been performing to the expectations we have seen.\"\n\nAfter Sunday's humiliating defeat by City, Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor indicated she had hoped for more January signings.\n\n\"I couldn't believe that. She has the strongest team quality-wise when looking at depth and signings made,\" former Scotland defender Beattie told BBC Women's Football Weekly.\n\n\"I could not tell you what positions she is looking to fill. There are no gaps.\"\n\nSecond-placed Manchester United, meanwhile, were active early on in the window, bringing in experienced Germany striker Lea Schuller, along with Sweden's Hanna Lundkvist and Ellen Wangerheim.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about where United want to take their women's team and the signing of Lea Schuller is the answer - she is prolific,\" Houghton said.\n\n\"Defensively, they've always been solid and now they've bought a really good all-round player to strengthen their forward line. They are right in the mix.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Champions Cup winners Arsenal have also added some young Swedish talent to their squad, with Smilla Holmberg the only new arrival in north London.\n\nAs Tottenham look to continue their fine start to the season and boost their chances of European football next term, Martin Ho has added a handful of new signings to his squad - including one of the world's best young talents in Signe Gaupset.\n\n\"Martin Ho has done a really good job of propelling them into the top half of the league and making them more consistent,\" said Houghton. \"I think Spurs have been really clever this window and are going from strength to strength.\"\n\nPromoted side London City Lionesses were the busiest team in the summer transfer window but they've taken a more measured approach this time around with just one new signing - France international Delphine Cascarino.\n\n\"She's clever, quick and I like watching her play,\" Houghton said of Cascarino. \"London City did a lot of their business in the summer and now all the foundations are there for them in the WSL.\"\n\nAston Villa, meanwhile, have shown ambition in bringing in Oriane Jean-Francois from Chelsea for £450,000 and they've also signed Arsenal defender Jenna Nighswonger on loan.\n\nEverton, who sit ninth, have opted to bring in two players on loan deals, with Manchester United's Hannah Blundell and Arsenal's Laila Harbert joining for the rest of the season.\n\nMeanwhile, 10th-placed Leicester have been more active, snapping up experienced WSL players Alisha Lehmann, Ashleigh Neville, Sarah Mayling and Rachel Williams to help distance themselves from the relegation play-off spot.\n\nBut it is the bottom two clubs - West Ham and Liverpool - who have been the busiest, each bringing in six new players.\n\nUnder new boss Rita Guarino, the Irons have strengthened their defence with the additions of Estelle Cascarino and Tuva Hansen while Katie Zelem - on loan from London City - adds experience to the midfield.\n\nHowever, key defenders Anouk Denton and Amber Tysiak have left the club.\n\nStruggling at the bottom of the table, Liverpool have reinforced across their squad to try to get out of trouble.\n\nSweden goalkeeper Jennifer Falk has already become the club's number-one goalkeeper, while Republic of Ireland midfielder Denise O'Sullivan became the club's record signing.\n\nIn attack, forwards Alice Bergstrom, Anna Josendal and Aurelie Csillag have all joined on permanent deals, along with Spurs striker Martha Thomas on loan.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Snooker legend and BBC commentator John Virgo has died aged 79.\n\nVirgo enjoyed an 18-year professional career, winning the UK Championship and reaching the semi-finals of the World Championship in 1979.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for his post-playing career, presenting popular snooker TV show Big Break alongside comedian Jim Davidson from 1991 to 2002.\n\nFollowing his retirement from playing in 1994, Virgo became a BBC commentator.\n\nHis last commentary for the BBC came 17 days ago when Kyren Wilson beat John Higgins in the Masters final.\n\nVirgo was a popular commentator, with his famous \"where's the cue ball going?\" catchphrase when a player was close to committing a foul.\n\nPlayers and officials held a minute's silence at the World Grand Prix in Hong Kong on Wednesday.\n\nSeven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan said: \"Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away.\n\n\"Such a great mate who I loved spending time with. Absolutely gutted.\"\n\nFour-time world champion Mark Selby said: \"So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo! Such a great guy and a huge character! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.\"\n\nFormer world champion Shaun Murphy, who worked alongside Virgo for the BBC, said: \"I first met John in 1994, filming Junior Big Break. He then went on to become a friend and colleague.\n\n\"I learned so much from him whilst sharing a commentary box. The voice of snooker will be sadly missed.\"\n\nVirgo regularly took part in exhibition matches, playing trick shots and performing impressions of other players.\n\nFormer world champion Neil Robertson said: \"He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator.\n\n\"I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was.\"\n\nA World Snooker statement read: \"Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo.\"\n\nFormer world number three Neal Foulds said: \"Terribly sad news that we have lost one of the greats of snooker in John Virgo.\n\n\"JV was incredibly generous, kind and funny. He was also a wonderful player and commentator. Thanks for all the great memories JV.\"\n\nVirgo, who was born in Salford in 1946, is survived by wife Rosie and children Gary and Brooke-Leah.\n\nJohn was a tremendous competitor and a very good break-builder - brilliant among the pink and black. He knew the game inside and out and backwards.\n\nThen he transcended the sport and went into the commentary box. He did Big Break with Jim Davidson, so he became a household name to everybody.\n\nIt was that voice which was very different to everyone else and made him stand out.\n\nYou could have a right laugh with him - he loved a joke.\n\nHe had a really good act and he did impersonations of Alex Higgins, Terry Griffiths, Cliff Thorburn - and they all loved it.\n\nIt was unusual for someone to do that at the end of an exhibition, but he was absolutely brilliant at it.\n\nI'm sure when we give him a tribute at the Crucible [for the World Championship in April] they will show his impressions routine, which is just hilarious.\n\nVirgo on the Snookered podcast in 2023",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at what next for Jean-Philippe Mateta after his dream move to AC Milan broke down over issues with his medical",
    "fullText": "Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta finds himself in a difficult position as he no doubt considers what's next after a dream move to AC Milan broke down over issues with his medical.\n\nPalace manager Oliver Glasner has spoken publicly about Mateta's issues with a knee injury in recent weeks.\n\nAnd that niggle may explain the striker's poor form; he has scored just once since the start of December.\n\nThe ailment, however, didn't prevent the player from trying to force a move away from Selhurst Park during the final days of the January transfer window.\n\nBut with Mateta now stuck at Palace after two rounds of medical tests spooked Milan officials enough to pull out of a deal worth £30m, his mind will turn to the immediate future.\n\nSources have indicated to BBC Sport that Palace were up front with Milan over Mateta's knee issues, sending the Italian club full medical reports towards the end of last week in preparation for a deal being concluded.\n\nBut, according to sources in Italy, Milan's reservations were over Mateta's right knee. The 28-year-old's meniscus had ruptured in 2019 when playing for Mainz and he underwent surgery that kept him out for around six months.\n\nIn their two examinations of Mateta, the Serie A club came to the conclusion that the striker would likely require an operation to cure the problem, described as an 'inflammation' of the knee.\n\nIt is Milan's view that the issue cannot resolved by therapy and load management.\n\nThe prospect of surgery does appear the common sense approach here.\n\nIt will allow the player to continue his career free of the pain he has struggled with in recent weeks. Likewise, it would help ease any concerns his future suitors may have over his fitness ahead of any move away from Selhurst Park.\n\nIt would also suit Palace to a point as it would likely eradicate the possibility of his current knee problems arising as an obstacle towards any future sale.\n\nMateta's current deal expires in 2027 when Palace would lose him for nothing, so the prospect of selling the player this summer will certainly be considered.\n\nBut with the chance of playing in his first World Cup looming large, any surgery for Mateta may have implications towards his selection for the tournament.\n\nDepending on the timescale of recovery and rehabilitation, an operation would eat into the time Mateta has to convince France manager Didier Deschamps that he is worthy of a place for Les Bleus this summer.\n\nThe club record signing of Jorgen Strand Larsen will also impact Mateta's first-team opportunities between now and the summer, too, given the £48m outlay.\n\nMateta has scored two goals in three matches for France since his debut last year. Fulfilling his World Cup ambition is within reach but he is facing having limited minutes on the pitch for the remainder of the season as he looks to reinforce his international case.\n\nAnd that's the quandary that faces Mateta as he contends with the aftermath of his failed move to the San Siro.",

They've slotted in really well, which is testament to them.\"\n\nCrystal Palace's deadline day move for Strand Larsen meant they spent £83m in the winter window, having signed Brennan Johnson for £35m from Tottenham.\n\nAston Villa - who are third - were the only other top-six side to pay out transfer fees during the winter window. They spent £18.25m on bringing back striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas and £10.5m on winger Alysson from Gremio.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal did no business during the winter window, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool - fourth, fifth and sixth respectively - also quiet.\n\nWhile Manchester City spent money to bolster their squad for a title fight, at the other end of the table West Ham splashed out in a bid to avoid relegation to the Championship.\n\nThe Hammers, who are third from bottom and six points adrift of safety, spent a reported £21.8m on Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente and around £25m on striker Taty Castellanos from Lazio.\n\nTottenham, who are 14th, spent £35m on signing midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid, while Bournemouth used some of their money from the Semenyo sale to sign teenage striker Rayan from Vasco da Gama for £24.7m and Hungary midfielder Alex Toth for £10.4m from Ferencvaros.\n\nDespite a quiet deadline day, Premier League clubs still spent more overall in the winter window than sides in other major European leagues.\n\nThe next-biggest spending league was Serie A, with their clubs paying out a combined £205m in transfer fees.\n\nSassuolo were one of the most active Italian clubs, paying £22m for Marseille duo Ismael Kone and Darryl Bakola.\n\nIn Spain, the transfer window closed at 22:59 GMT, but La Liga business was quiet, with Atletico Madrid's £30m deal for Ademola Lookman more than was spent be the rest of the division's clubs combined (£20.3m).\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "BBC Sport Wales looks at key moments in the history of the world third oldest football association, formed in Wrexham on 2 February, 1876.",
    "fullText": "It is perhaps little wonder that Wrexham can feel like the centre of Welsh football given it was the birthplace of the Football Association of Wales (FAW).\n\nOn 2 February, 1876 only the third football association in the world was formed following a meeting at the town's Wynnstay Arms Hotel.\n\nLlewelyn Kendrick, a solicitor, was appointed chairman with Hawley Edwards taking the role of treasurer.\n\nA century and a half later the FAW is unrecognisable from the association established in the three story Georgian red-brick hotel that still stands in the centre of Wrexham today.\n\nBBC Sport Wales looks back at the most significant moments in the association's history.\n\n'Welsh wizard' Wilson targets Europe and World Cup\n\nA warrior touched by tragedy - Terry Yorath obituary\n\nFAW chief executive Mooney extends contract to 2030\n\nFounded three years after the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and 13 after the FA in England, the FAW is the third oldest football association in the world.\n\nSome seven weeks later - on 25 March, 1876 - the Wales men's team played their first international match, losing 4-0 away to Scotland at Partick.\n\nA year later, Scotland travelled to Wrexham and beat Wales 2-0 in their first home international at the Racecourse Ground - now named Stok Cae Ras - which remains the oldest international football stadium still in use.\n\nWales had to wait four years until 1881 for their first victory when John Vaughan scored the only goal to clinch a 1-0 win over England in Blackburn.\n\nThe 1950s marked a golden era for the Wales men's team, featuring iconic players such as John and Mel Charles, Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, Trevor Ford and Terry Medwin.\n\nWorld Cup qualification was achieved for the first time in 1958 following a defeat of Israel in a play-off.\n\nThe tournament was held in Sweden and Wales faced the hosts, Mexico and Hungary in the group stages.\n\nAll three Wales group games ended level, but Jimmy Murphy's side booked a place in the quarter-finals with a play-off win against Hungary.\n\nGoals from Allchurch and Medwin set up a tie against Brazil, but Wales would be without their talisman John Charles who was injured in the game after some ferocious treatment from the Hungarians.\n\nA 17-year-old Pele scored the only goal as Brazil won the quarter-final 1-0 but almost 70 years on Welsh football fans still wonder what might have been had Charles lined up to face Brazil.\n\nIt took more than a century for the FAW to formally recognise a women's national team.\n\nInitially established in 1973, the team received no support from the FAW as players were forced to arrange their own training sessions and matches as well as funding it themselves.\n\nA crowd of around 3,500 witnessed their first fixture against the Republic of Ireland in Llanelli, and saw Wales play in kits borrowed from Swansea City's men's team.\n\nWearing shirts several sizes too big for them, Gaynor Blackwell and Gloria O'Connell scored the side's first goals in a 3-2 defeat.\n\nTwo decades passed before the FAW would take official control of the women's side.\n\nIn 1993 players Laura McAllister, Michele Adams and Karen Jones successfully persuaded association secretary Alun Evans to finally take responsibility for the Wales women's team.\n\nConcerns over Wales' status as an independent football nation grew in the 1980s which many felt threatened the very existence of the FAW.\n\nLeading Welsh clubs competed in the English pyramid system, and the absence of a national domestic league was a source of indignation to many FIFA members.\n\nIn response, the League of Wales was formed in 1992.\n\nSome clubs, including Newport County, Merthyr Town and Colwyn Bay rejected an invitation to join and were forced to play their non-league league matches in the English system outside Wales.\n\nTwenty teams took part in the inaugural season of the new League of Wales and Cwmbran were crowned the first champions.\n\nSince 1992 the league has undergone several changes and is now known as the Cymru Premier, featuring 12 teams.\n\nThe New Saints are the competition's most successful club and have won the title on 17 occasions.\n\nThe summer of 2016 is immortalised in Welsh football folklore.\n\nWales had not qualified for a major international tournament since the World Cup of 1958 in Sweden.\n\nEuro 2016 in France gave a squad dubbed the 'golden generation' an opportunity to shine on the international stage.\n\nStars such as Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams led a squad of players to the summer of their lives.\n\nWales topped a group containing Slovakia, England and Russia, before beating Northern Ireland in Paris in the last 16.\n\nIn the quarter-finals they faced one of the tournament favourites, Belgium, in Lille.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu scored one of the most iconic goals in Wales' history in a 3-1 win that ranks as one of the best results in the 150 year history of Welsh international football.\n\nWithout the suspended Ramsey and Ben Davies, Wales were beaten by eventual Euro 2016 winners Portugal.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the semi-final in Lyon, but Euro 2016 remains a defining chapter for the national side.\n\nQualification for Euro 2025 marked a landmark moment for women's football in Wales.\n\nHead coach Rhian Wilkinson and her players secured their place in Welsh footballing history by reaching a major international tournament finals for the first time.\n\nThe tournament was held in Switzerland and Wales faced world class opponents in the group stage.\n\nHeavy defeats to the Netherlands, France and England on the pitch were countered by some unforgettable moments including the singing of the national anthem before the opening match against the Netherlands, Jess Fishlock's goal against France and the passionate support of the Red Wall.\n\nThe hope now is that Euro 2025 will inspire more girls and women to take up the sport in Wales.\n\nEarly signs are encouraging, with more than 20,000 girls and women now registered to play football.\n\nThe next target is qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup, as Wales look to add another memorable chapter to the story of the national team.\n\n'World Cup could earn millions for Welsh grassroots'\n\n'We have so much to thank Terry for' - Bellamy\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying",

    "fullText": "Transfer deadline day has become an event for fans and something of a media circus in recent years, but it has always been an important day for managers, even before the current system of having transfer windows was introduced in 2002.\n\nGet it right - and get the player or players you want in at the 11th hour - and you can turn your season around.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't get important deals done or lose someone without replacing them, it can take the wind out of your sails and deflate a team involved in a promotion bid or survival battle.\n\nI never saw making late signings as a risk, because I always thought the players I was bringing in would make the team better.\n\nLooking back at the transfer deadline day deals I was involved in was really interesting. Yes, I had a few stinkers, but also some really good ones. A theme emerged which showed that if you can do good business, it can really change the fortunes of the team.\n\nAt Crystal Palace on the final day of the January window in 2014, for example, the permanent additions of Scott Dann, Wayne Hennessey, Joe Ledley and also Tom Ince on loan, sparked an amazing turnaround.\n\nWe were in a relegation battle and in serious trouble near the bottom of the Premier League when they arrived but we ended up 11th, 12 points clear of the bottom three, after securing our survival with three games to go.\n\nAll four new players were great positives who played a huge part in our improvement. I am not saying they upgraded the quality of our players but they gave us a better balance as a team, which I felt we lacked before they came in.\n\nGaining that balance enabled us to stay in the Premier League.",

But the 53-year-old is the only football entry in Forbes' '50 over 50' list for 2026.\n\nEvery January, the global media company publishes the 50 women who have reached a position of status and influence that makes them beacons for others to follow.\n\nOscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz is there, so too Dame Sarah Mullally - the first female Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nAs football's first female super agent, Brazilian Pimenta is hugely influential.\n\nHer impressive stable of clients includes Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, Liverpool manager Arne Slot and 17-year-old Mexican wonderkid Gilberto Mora.\n\nShe radiates warmness as she arrives on time to speak exclusively to BBC Sport. Once the cameras are rolling, Pimenta is deadly serious as she covers a range of topics, including the treatment of women in football.\n\nBut, on the eve of deadline day, let's start with her concerns about the present transfer system.\n\n\"There needs to be a change,\" she explains. \"There's too much power for clubs.\n\n\"Players are sometimes hostages of situations. I'm not fighting for chaos. We need the transfer system for the whole thing to work. But we need more balance.\n\n\"We are in a transfer window, and I can bet you, because I see it at the end of every window, somebody will cry. There's always a player crying because he could have gone, needed to go and a club said they want £1m more.\"\n\nIn October 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) found rules implemented by world governing body Fifa, which govern the way some football transfers work, break European Union laws.\n\nFifa subsequently introduced an interim framework based on the calculation of compensation payable and burden of proof if there is a breach of contract.\n\n\"Football used to be more human,\" Pimenta adds. \"A football director or an owner would have a special relationship with the player. If a player went to them and said 'please, I need to go', they would find a solution.\n\n\"Today, football is becoming so much of a business there is a risk that players become an asset on the balance sheet. An asset has no voice, no feelings, no human needs.\n\n\"The challenge is to find a balance between the asset and the human being.\"",

    "fullText": "When Dominic Calvert-Lewin left Everton last summer after nine years with the club, he could be forgiven for being a little fearful of what his future held.\n\nThe striker struggled with injuries in the latter stages of his Toffees career and managed just three goals in his final season, meaning whoever did sign him was likely taking a bit of a risk.\n\nBut that gamble has paid off for Leeds, with Calvert-Lewin having revived his career with an excellent scoring run under Daniel Farke, scoring seven goals in his past six games.\n\nThat form has also led to talk of his return to the England squad and possibly even a place at the 2026 World Cup - something that seemed very unlikely just six months ago.\n\nCalvert-Lewin sat down with BBC Sport's Betty Glover to talk about his return to goalscoring, the reality of being a free agent and his England chances.",

You can only get the packaging around New Year's as well. Don't look at the calories actually, because that's why we don't have them all year round!\n\nAlex: Some recipes had currants and raisins for this...\n\nKerstin: I don't like the raisins!\n\nAlex: We're on the same wavelength there! I'll warn you, I'm not very good at hiding things if I don't like them.\n\nKerstin: Alex, I'm Dutch. Do I look like the type that hides it?\n\nAlex: Talk to me a bit more about life at home because you grew up in what, a remote part of the Netherlands?\n\nKerstin: So I'm a northern girl. I'm from a province called the Friesland and I'm very lucky that I grew up in a small town where a lot of sports are available. Playing was like a two-minute walk from where I used to live, which was perfect.\n\nAlex: I feel like it was always definite you were going to go on and be an athlete then?\n\nKerstin: Well, my parents met both playing for the Dutch national team and they both did judo, so there was no choice other for us than to do sports.\n\nAlex: How did the people back home describe you back then?\n\nKerstin: People mostly described me as loud, very chatty - I'm raging ADHD. I've calmed down a little bit now but as a child I was all over the shop. It was such a good thing, growing up and wanting to become an athlete, because I was so hyper-focused on football.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's hard to navigate, so how did you do that?\n\nKerstin: At that time I was really struggling to keep up in school, to get ready for tests and also do all my football. Once I had the diagnosis, I was speaking to psychologists and my parents were very supportive. It takes time and I still have a lot of things to learn about myself.\n\nAlex: Would you say Manchester feels like home for you now?\n\nKerstin: Definitely. I think the people here are so nice. That's one of the things I heard when I was going to join. I live here with my girlfriend - we've got our cats.\n\nAlex: So you met your girlfriend in Manchester?\n\nKerstin: We met on Tinder in Manchester. It was great for me because I was a bit lonely, living on my own and I was just excited to meet other people outside my team-mates. I love my team-mates but sometimes you want to see other people as well.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's the part that's hard to explain. Yes, you are fully immersed in football but it's equally as important to have other hobbies.\n\nKerstin: My girlfriend always says: 'You've got such a football perspective' and also just work-life balance. It's so different than she has, working nine to five and being off at weekends. Your work is not your life, not your personality and it doesn't define who you are. Being able to see that side of it and her allowing me to step away is really nice.\n\nAlex: You said you met on Tinder?\n\nKerstin: Yeah and to be fair, I was debating whether to go on Tinder. This was at the point in my career where I wasn't that known.\n\nAlex: Did I read you didn't put any photos up on Tinder of you in football kit?\n\nKerstin: I didn't put any bio - I didn't put any pictures of football. So Ruth had no idea that I was even sporty. She thought I was a gardener because I was tanned… She had no idea about football so it was fun to introduce her to the world and now she's a massive fan. She knows all the gossip! Sometimes she comes home and she tells me these things and I'm like: 'How do you know this?'\n\nAlex: So you've got Ruth, and now two cats?\n\nKerstin: Kiwi and Mango. Both fruits. I got Kiwi because I was on my own and I was very lonely. Then I met Ruth a couple of months later and we're both away quite a lot so we thought we should get Kiwi a brother.\n\nAlex: And next level, you have a tattoo.\n\nKerstin: Yes, I've got a tattoo of them. Should I show you? I've got a tattoo of them looking into a wine glass just because they're cute and silly.\n\nAlex: Are you fully immersed in Manc life? What kind of slang words?\n\nKerstin: I kinda just copy everyone else.\n\nAlex: What about when you're back with the Dutch team?\n\nKerstin: I definitely struggle having to switch to Dutch again, like finding the words because I only speak Dutch with my mum.\n\nAlex: What are the team meetings like in Manchester City then? Is it fully English or do you have translators?\n\nKerstin: It's all English. I know some that do struggle a little bit and when they have a meeting with the coach, they do have a translator to make sure they're being heard. To be fair, team meetings are really good. Andree [Jeglertz] really made a point about it being really open. We're all in a massive circle rather than an auditorium so when you speak you can actually look directly at each other. We really work together and everybody has a voice.\n\nAlex: You do team bonding stuff?\n\nKerstin: We've made it a very big thing to have a lot of team activities this year. So I'm captain of the team activity crew together with Laura Coombs. We went to Crystal Maze the other day with players and staff, which we've made a big thing. We want to get together with the staff as well, just to get that connection.\n\nAlex: It's how they know you away from the field as well.\n\nKerstin: Yeah, exactly. More of your personality. Sometimes it can be a bit of a step to approach someone in a leadership role and to get everybody together and just do something fun away from the club in your own clothes creates such a nice bond. You actually have conversations that you might not have at the club.\n\nAlex: I think you've done a cooking class didn't you? How did that go?\n\nKerstin: It was a success - it was Italian dishes. Some people made amazing risotto, they were getting the lemon in and it looked unreal. Some people burned it and some people were screaming that it was sticking to the pan.\n\nAlex: Come on, name names. Who's the bad cook?\n\nKerstin: I'm not going to expose my team-mates.\n\nAlex: Let's talk about temptations and cravings, because people are starting to talk about Manchester City potentially lifting the WSL trophy this season. Are you believing? Why are you laughing at me?\n\nKerstin: I mean, it's kind of funny because we were in such an underdog position going into this season. I felt like everybody was talking about Chelsea, Arsenal, [Manchester] United. It was kind of nice being left out of the conversation and I think we really took that as motivation.\n\nAlex: What do you think has changed?\n\nKerstin: It's little tweaks that matter the most, and also Andree's playing style. We get so much freedom, and also trust and responsibility. Previously it was a good system but a bit robotic at times. We do all the analysis and he gives us everything we need but if something's a bit different, he can't change that from the side. Leaving that space allows us to be adaptable on the pitch.\n\nAlex: What do you put your form down to?\n\nKerstin: I've got such a strong desire to show everybody what I can do and be the best that I can be. I'm really enjoying our offensive style of play this year and linking up with Bunny [Shaw] and Kerolin and all the other incredible forwards that we have. It's just been a joy to work. I go every day with a smile on my face.\n\nAlex: I've always wanted to learn about different cultures and I suppose you have that at Manchester City?\n\nKerstin: That's one of the things I love about football in general. We travel to these amazing places, but also my team-mates are from many different continents and cultures. It's been an eye-opener because I'm from a northern town in the Netherlands. We didn't have a lot of diversity growing up, so meeting these incredible people has been really inspiring.\n\nAlex: There are some cheeky elements to your game, which I absolutely love. Is this you trying to put the opposition off?\n\nKerstin: To be fair, I'm a bit annoying when I'm marking, like trying to push away. I'm not the tallest, I'm not the best at heading so I'm a blocker. Just be the annoying little fly, the little mosquito that doesn't let them head the ball.\n\nAlex: You've now got Dutch team-mate Vivianne Miedama at the club - what's it like having her at club level?\n\nKerstin: She's a fantastic player. In training, it looks so easy and she looks like she's putting in minimum effort and she bangs it into top bins. I swear at her in Dutch - no-one knows what I'm saying! She's such a good player to have with all her experience. A little bit of Dutchness can do wonders.\n\nWatch: Manchester City v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Sunday, 1 February (14:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "BREAKING: BBC Confirms Authenticity of Viral Video Appearing to Show Alex Pretti Kicking Agents’ Car 11 Days Before Shooting",
    "description": "After much speculation online, the BBC has confirmed the authenticity of new viral footage appearing to show Alex Pretti kicking an agent's car on Jan. 13 — 11 days before he was shot to death by Border Patrol agents.",
    "fullText": "Footage published on Wednesday appeared to show Alex Pretti kicking an immigration agent’s car before getting thrown to the ground during a confrontation less than two weeks before he was shot and killed in Minneapolis.\n\nThe News Movement was the outlet that captured the incident on Jan. 13. It said in an X post that it “appears to be Alex Pretti interacting with federal immigration agents” and that it had the clip analyzed by the BBC, “whose facial recognition technology confirmed his identify to a 97% degree of accuracy.”\n\nThe BBC confirmed the authenticity of the video in their 10 p.m. GMT news broadcast. Reporter Ros Atkins said the man in the video “has the same coat, facial hair and gait as Alex Pretti and a facial recognition tool suggests a 97% match. We see him shouting abuse at the agents.” Separately, a spokesperson for the BBC confirmed to Mediaite that they reviewed the footage and verified its team did use facial recognition technology on the video.\n\nYou can watch the BBC footage below, or watch the footage on their website (the relevant portion begins at the :50 mark):\n\nCNN, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, and other outlets have also now confirmed with the Pretti family that the man in the video is Alex Pretti.\n\nA narrator for the video said TNM’s team — comprised of reporters Dallin Mello and Dan Ming — received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street in Minneapolis around 10:15 a.m. When they arrived, they recorded a man who looked like Pretti spitting on a Ford SUV and shouting at immigration agents that they were  “f*cking trash!”\n\nThe man who looked like Pretti was wearing a black hat, brown coat, and had a beard; the narrator noted it was similar to the outfit Pretti wore when he was killed on January 24. He then smashed the right tail light by kicking it two times and flipped the middle finger at the vehicle.\n\nAt that point, “An agent then got out of the vehicle, grabbed him, and pushed him to the ground,” the voiceover said.\n\nThe man who appeared to be Pretti could be seen trying to scurry away from one agent before another agent grabbed him and they both threw him down.\n\n“During the altercation, agents fired tear gas and pepper balls into the crowd,” the narrator continued. “They continued to hold the man down before they retreat and he walks away.”\n\nThe narrator said there appears to be a gun “visible above his waistband” in the footage.\n\nWe were filming a documentary about ICE activity in Minneapolis when we received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street, and captured this footage.\n\nReporting by @danming, Dallin Mello, and BBC Verify.https://t.co/sZcpUBQOpr\n\n— The News Movement (@thenewsmovement) January 28, 2026\n\nThe footage quickly went viral on X shortly after it was posted on Wednesday. Republican communications adviser Steve Guest posted the clip and it pulled in 1.4 million views in its first two hours. He incorrectly said it was a “bombshell report from the BBC” — a mistake several other users made.\n\n“Important context: Pretti was not a peaceful protester,” Guest added.\n\nMUST WATCH: Footage of an a man who looks like Alex Pretti with a gun in his waistband, spitting on and attacking federal law enforcement officers and kicking the tail light of their vehicle on January 13.\n\nImportant context: Pretti was not a… pic.twitter.com/snzEO8rU8w\n\n— Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) January 28, 2026\n\nGreg Price — who lists “Rapid Response Manager” for President Donald Trump’s White House as one of his jobs on LinkedIn — also shared the clip.\n\n“Alex Pretti spits on a federal agent and then kicks out his taillight in footage released by the BBC from 11 days before his death,” he posted.\n\nAlex Pretti spits on a federal agent and then kicks out his taillight in footage released by the BBC from 11 days before his death.pic.twitter.com/64hg4FXv1a\n\n— Greg Price (@greg_price11) January 28, 2026\n\nMegyn Kelly shared the clip and said it showed Pretti had been “itching for another confrontation with Border Patrol, whom he’d been stalking, harassing and terrorizing.”\n\nShe continued, “HE had been victimizing THEM. His felonies are on tape. He was reckless, and it cost him his life.

    "fullText": "At the High Performance Centre in Dublin during the week between Christmas and New Year, approximately 100 kickers and punters, all NFL hopefuls from across the island of Ireland, assembled for a winter training session under the watchful eyes of Tadhg Leader and his staff.\n\nA former rugby fly-half who switched to kicking as a player, Leader now runs an academy helping prospective talent get scholarships in the USA, as well as serving as a coach on the NFL's International Player Pathway (IPP) programme.\n\nWhile it is a relatively new phenomenon, the prospect of playing college football Stateside before then embarking on a career in the NFL is no longer a pipe dream for the hopefuls in attendance.\n\nIn 1985, the Dubliner Neil O'Donoghue ended his eight-year, three-team career at the then St Louis Cardinals, and when Derry's Jude McAtamney took to the field for the New York Giants in November 2024, it bridged a near 40-year gap.\n\nYet after McAtamney, there was no such wait for the next Irish presence in the league. In December 2025, fellow former GAA player Charlie Smyth, from Mayobridge in County Down, followed in his footsteps.",

    "fullText": "Some fans were left wondering why Joe Root opted not to wear a cap while hitting a century in the heat against Sri Lanka's spinners in the third one-day international.\n\nIt is not unusual to see players such as India's Virat Kohli batting with a hat on, but Root wore a helmet throughout his innings despite the humidity in Colombo.\n\nWearing a helmet is not compulsory for batters facing slow and medium pace bowlers in international cricket, but it is mandatory for all England players in the various formats.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) head protection regulations were brought in to mitigate the chance of players being struck on the head by bowlers, fielders and also themselves with the bat.\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) rules that batters must sport a helmet when facing pace bowlers, but it is optional at other times.\n\nEnglish first-class cricketers have had to wear helmets against all types of bowlers since the 2016 season, but it is not mandatory for adults at a recreational level.\n\nAll cricketers under the age of 18 in England and Wales must wear a head protector while batting in matches or practice sessions. Wicketkeepers under the age of 18 also have to wear a helmet when standing up to the stumps.\n\n\"The cricket ball can cause significant injury and it is extremely important that players take the appropriate precautions when batting, keeping wicket or fielding close to the stumps,\" said ECB chief medical officer Dr Nick Peirce when the regulations were introduced in 2015.\n\nThe ECB also advises players to wear neck protectors, but they are not mandatory. In Australia they have been compulsory for all batters facing fast or medium pace in Cricket Australia competitions since the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe regulation was brought in following the death of Phillip Hughes in 2014.\n\nHughes was struck on the top of the neck by a ball during a Sheffield Shield match in Sydney.\n\nHe collapsed and was taken to hospital, where he died two days later.\n\nThe neck protectors attach to helmets to provide extra protection at the back of the head and neck.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhat is Curran's ultra-slow 'moon ball?'\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?\n\nWhat difference does grass make to a cricket pitch?",
