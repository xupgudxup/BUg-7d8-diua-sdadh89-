    "fullText": "On days like this, when a manager falls, the immediate reaction is to think about where it all went wrong, the timeline of doom, the moments where the writing started appearing on the wall.\n\nWith Wilfried Nancy, there's no need for any of that because it was never right in the first place. There were no turning points in this saga, no twists in the plot.\n\nNancy's appointment was one of the greatest blunders Celtic have made in their history. A relative rookie on a bad run with Columbus Crew - they finished seventh in Major League Soccer - it was a punt based on little more than the hipster vibes of Paul Tisdale, the now former head of football operations.\n\nTisdale didn't open his mouth to fans or media in his brief time in a powerful position at Celtic Park, but he did a whole lot of damage. If Nancy ranks extremely highly in the club's most calamitous calls then Tisdale is on a par or, perhaps even, slightly ahead of him given that it was the self-styled 'Doctor Football' who championed Nancy to the club's board.\n\nNancy never got out of the blocks, his two wins from eight games coming in a flawed victory over bottom-of-the-table Livingston and a triumph over 10-man Aberdeen, who have also just sacked their manager.\n\nAll memory of Nancy's reign - if you want to call it that - will be shovelled under a carpet now by anybody and everybody culpable in the process of appointing him. If they're all true to recent form, none of them will speak, none will apologise, none will show humility by accepting that they got this woefully wrong.\n\nThe fans will have to make-do with a short written statement. Let them eat cake, in other words.\n\nNancy's laidback arrival - spending just 15 minutes talking with Martin O'Neill before ripping up everything O'Neill had done to stabilise things - was in stark contrast to the unceremonious manner of his exit. O'Neill, as interim, was there longer than Nancy.",

    "description": "As Leeds aim to beat Manchester United in the Premier League for the first time since 2002, BBC Sport looks at their intense rivalry before Sunday's Elland Road meeting.",
    "fullText": "In his best-selling 'Managing My Life' autobiography, Sir Alex Ferguson reflected on his feelings about a trip to Elland Road.\n\n\"The crowd invariably give us the impression that a lynching would be too good for us,\" he said.\n\nAfter a typically fraught League Cup victory there in 2011, Ferguson offered this observation too.\n\n\"I have always said Liverpool-Manchester United games are fierce in many aspects,\" he added.\n\n\"But it never reaches the levels of Leeds United. Never.\"\n\nLeeds have already hosted a couple of historic rivals in December, beating Chelsea 3-1 at home and producing an epic fightback to snatch a point in a 3-3 draw against Liverpool.\n\nBut a visit from Manchester United is something else.\n\n\"I have a decorating firm and for 40 years we have had the motto that we will not use red paint,\" said lifelong Leeds fan Gary Edwards.\n\n\"We will paint over red free of charge. It's still going to this day. It's on all the business cards and letterheads.\"\n\nThe actual origins of the rivalry are difficult to pinpoint.\n\nMany feel it dates to the War of the Roses in the 15th century, although that is probably too simplistic given the Duchy and Dukedom of the Houses of York and Lancaster had little to do with the cities themselves and the Duchy of Lancaster had land and offices in Yorkshire.\n\nOthers think the rivalry has its origins in the industrial revolution which does, at least in part, correspond to the emergence of football as an organised sport - even if neither club, either originally as Leeds City and Newton Heath, or their current names, came to real prominence until after the Second World War.\n\nPossibly, the reverence from the 1950s and beyond for the Busby Babes compared to the negativity around Don Revie's team in the 1960s and 70s, is a factor.\n\nThe knowledge that key players - Johnny Giles, Gordon Strachan, Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Denis Irwin and Eric Cantona among them - left one club to become an integral part of the success of the other is another. Also, the proximity of the best supported teams from the two biggest cities in two neighbouring counties, separated geographically, by the Pennines.\n\nWhatever it is, the rivalry is real and despite the early 12:30 GMT kick-off, Elland Road is guaranteed to be a cauldron as Leeds look for their first home victory over Manchester United in the Premier League since 2002, when Harry Kewell scored the winner.\n\nFormer England goalkeeper Paul Robinson was in goal for Leeds that day and told BBC Sport: \"One hundred percent it feels different.\n\n\"You get to the stadium two hours before kick-off and certain areas are sectioned off. There are police here, you can't drive there. This road is closed, that road is closed.\n\n\"It is as intense as any derby that you want to name in this country - and it is not friendly.\n\n\"I grew up as a kid in the Leeds academy and was a ball boy at some games. The away section used to be in the cheese wedge in the corner of Elland Road. For most of the season, nobody wanted to be a ball boy in that corner. But when Manchester United came to town, everybody wanted to be over in that corner, for whatever reason.\n\n\"It was just a different game and a different experience.\"\n\nNeither manager has been part of a Leeds-Manchester United game before.\n\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke knows it is a game that means a lot for his club's fans and is talking about making \"dreams come true\".\n\nManchester United's Portuguese head coach Ruben Amorim has been at the centre of the Dérbi de Lisboa, as a player for Benfica and a coach at Lisbon rivals Sporting.\n\nHe is not sure the comparison is particularly helpful.\n\n\"I heard it is a big rivalry and a big derby,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"It is hard to compare different cultures, different derbies and different histories. It's a game in a hostile environment and that is going to be hard for any player. But when you play for Manchester United, you need to be ready for everything.\"\n\nLeeds' last title-winning campaign in 1992 was made more satisfying because they won it at the expense of Manchester United, who were in control of their own destiny until a run of three successive defeats in the space of seven days right at the end of the season let Howard Wilkinson's side in.\n\nSadly for Leeds, the post-script came the following November, when chief executive Bill Fotherby rang Manchester United counterpart Martin Edwards to ask about the chances of bringing full-back Irwin back to the club.\n\nFerguson was in the room and said no to Irwin leaving, but told Edwards to mention the availability of French forward Cantona. It was a call that changed the course of English footballing history.\n\n\"I've never forgiven Bill for that,\" says Gary Edwards.\n\nMaybe one of the reasons why Leeds' rivalry with Manchester United doesn't spring to mind in the same way as others in England is the relative infrequency of it happening.\n\nApart from the 14-year spell that began with Leeds' top-flight promotion in 1990 and relegation in 2004, the two clubs met only eight times in the other 30 years from 1982. Leeds won once in 2010, as a League One side at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, and lost on five occasions.\n\nThe two clubs' fans don't forget though.\n\n\"Even when Leeds were in League One and the Championship, Manchester United still sang a song about teams they didn't like and tagged 'and Leeds' on to it,\" said Robinson, who had six years at Leeds before joining Tottenham in 2004.\n\n\"Week in, week out, no matter what league they are in or who they are playing against, Leeds fans take great pride week in describing their dislike of Manchester United.\"\n\nLeeds go into the game in better form, having added a goalless New Year's Day draw draw at Anfield to their home comeback against Arne Slot's men to take their current unbeaten record to six games and seven points clear of relegation in 16th place. It is their best top-flight form since April 2021, when Marcelo Bielsa was in charge.\n\nRegardless, Robinson believes there are some Leeds fans for whom a successful season this time around would be to finish 17th and beat Manchester United.\n\n\"That does exist,\" said Gary Edwards. \"I'm not quite like that, but 100% there are fans who think that way.\n\n\"I just feel it is as good a time to play them as any because we have turned a corner.\n\n\"We've kept the same formation and the same players who looked dire at the start of the season are now assured and confident.\n\n\"It will make the game interesting. Very, very interesting.\"",

Over-promoted and out of his depth.\n\nA first half at Celtic Park that offered such promise made way for another second half of dismal collapse. They had Rangers on the ropes at the break but you always sensed that they needed a second goal to put them on the floor and maybe a third just to put them out for the count. These are Celtic's frailties these days. One goal is never enough.\n\nThose goals never came despite the chances they had. Once Rangers started to fight back, they hit Celtic with three blows in 21 minutes. Ruthless. The Celtic lights went out in an instant. From light to dark in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe colossal weaknesses in Nancy's formation, the giant amounts of space conceded by his players were the problem again. That and their inability to stay in the fight. Was their feeble demise a window to their collective soul, a reflection of their spirit under the new, and surely doomed, manager? It looked like that. A lost dressing room? Perhaps. Just because it's a cliche doesn't mean it isn't true.",

This winter will be Ed's 20th year working on the iconic BBC Sport programme.\n\nContext is everything. Twenty years in the context of geology is a heartbeat, a snowflake in the blizzard of time - but change the context to the world of television and the same period represents a fifth of TV's lifespan.\n\nIn my two decades on Ski Sunday, I have witnessed huge leaps in human performance, frightening environmental changes, inspiring shifts in alpine and winter sports culture and incredible advances in technology.\n\nThe biggest (and my personal favourite) change during my tenure at Ski Sunday has been in women's sport.\n\nSki Sunday's coverage was dominated in its early years by the daring of Franz Klammer and Jean-Claude Killy, the machismo of Alberto Tomba and the aggression of Hermann Maier.\n\nBut the rise of female stars in the 21st Century has been a joy to watch. Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Schiffrin's record-breaking careers have elevated female skiing's profile above male skiing in many countries.\n\nCloser to home my co-presenter Chemmy Alcott was a consistent top-10 campaigner in alpine and Jenny Jones, Izzy and Zoe Atkin, Charlotte Bankes, Mia Brookes and Kirsty Muir have outshone the men, claiming numerous British firsts with World Cup, World Championship and X Games titles.\n\nJenny and Izzy have both won Olympic medals and it is impossible not to dream, looking at Mia, Kirsty, Charlotte and Zoe's form, that the 2026 Winter Games in Milan in February might produce Team GB's first ever gold on snow.",

Them reassuring me was was huge.\n\n\"Having them means I can go home to a safe place, rest, recover, and focus on what I want to focus on.\"\n\nSo how can total strangers build up the kind of affectionate, trustful bond that allows young players to go on and thrive at the top level?",

The Argentina forward scored 91 goals in 2012.\n\nLamine Yamal is only 18 but it feels like he has been on the scene for a while as he regularly makes the headlines for his standout performances.\n\nHe shone for Spain as they won Euro 2024 last year and has continued to rise in 2025.\n\nThe teenager has seven goals and eight assists after 14 La Liga games for Barcelona so far this season.\n\nIn the first half of this year, he scored 11 goals and provided 10 assists for club and country.\n\nOusmane Dembele made an incredible start to 2025 as he scored 15 goals in his first eight games of the year on his way to finishing the 2024-25 campaign with 35 goals in 53 games - by far and away his best goalscoring form in any season.\n\nThe 28-year-old's performances on the pitch saw him win his first Ballon d'Or and although the goals haven't quite flowed as well so far this term, it has nevertheless been a brilliant year for the France forward.\n\nIt takes a brave person not to captain Erling Haaland in their Fantasy Premier League team because the Manchester City striker, 25, has been simply sensational in front of goal this season.\n\nHe has scored 25 goals in just 24 appearances this season while he was in equally deadly form for Norway as he helped them qualify for a first World Cup since 1998 by scoring 16 goals in their eight qualifiers.\n\nThis has been a difficult season so far for Cole Palmer with injury limiting his game time but he was the standout player at this summer's Club World Cup and was a key player for Chelsea last season.\n\nHe helped the Blues secure a return to the Champions League for this season, provided two vital assists as Chelsea beat Real Betis in the Conference League final and then was named player of the tournament at the Club World Cup, outshining some of the biggest teams and players in world football.\n\nPalmer, 23, scored three goals and provided two assists, with no other player surpassing his five goal involvements.\n\nGiven they won the Treble, Paris St-Germain players were always going to dominate this list.\n\nGoals and assists often grab the headlines but 23-year-old Nuno Mendes has cemented himself as one of the best left-backs in the world right now after some superb displays at full-back for PSG.\n\nGoalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who joined Manchester City from PSG in the summer, was named Fifa's best men's goalkeeper for 2025 earlier this month.\n\nThe Italy international was recognised for an exceptional year in which he won the Champions League for the first time and three domestic trophies with PSG.\n\nThe 26-year-old has since established himself as a key member of Pep Guardiola's City, who currently sit second in the Premier League and fourth in the Champions League.\n\nPedri, 23, who arguably enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career in 2024-25 as he helped Barcelona win the domestic treble, is now regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world.\n\nHe had the most recoveries (254) among players in the top five European leagues last term and also showed he is one of the best chance creators in Europe as he created 70 chances for his Barcelona team-mates last season.\n\nWith injury issues seemingly behind him, he is continuing to play an important part for Barcelona this season and has helped them to sit top of La Liga, ahead of rivals Real Madrid.\n\nIt has been a prolific 2025 for Kylian Mbappe, who has scored 59 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid this year.\n\nThis means the 27-year-old striker has equalled the record number of goals scored in a calendar year which was set by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013.\n\nGiven the unglamorous nature of the role, a defensive midfielder has to be very, very good to be considered the best player in the world, but Vitinha, 25, has certainly been very, very good in 2025.\n\nCompared to the legendary Andres Iniesta, Vitinha possesses brilliant technique and positioning which help him to dominate games from the middle of the park for Paris St-Germain.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Josh Baker's parents tell BBC Sport how watching England in Australia is helping them with their loss.",
    "fullText": "In the moment England secured an Ashes victory over Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Paul Baker shed a tear.\n\nThe last time England won in Melbourne, 15 years ago, Paul and his wife Lisa were in the city with seven-year-old son Josh – cricket-mad and his life ahead of him.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Josh would go on to play 47 games for Worcestershire. He tragically died from an undiagnosed heart condition at the age of 20 in May 2024.\n\nWithout him, Lisa and Paul are back in Australia. The stars of England's win at the MCG were Josh's old team-mates Josh Tongue and Jacob Bethell.\n\n\"It was a moment of reflection,\" Paul tells BBC Sport. \"It was lovely to see England win at the MCG. I've got fond memories of sharing the moment with Josh in 2010.\"\n\nThe Bakers are regular Ashes tourists. They first came to watch England down under for the 2002-03 series when Lisa was five months pregnant with Josh.\n\nPaul is a former second XI captain at Redditch Cricket Club. Lisa knew nothing of the game before she met Paul, but was soon indoctrinated. Cricket was always going to be a huge part of Josh's life, including witnessing the Melbourne and Sydney Tests on England's Ashes-winning tour in 2010-11.\n\n\"He loved the Barmy Army, the singing and the chanting,\" says Paul. \"His eyes were on stalks, capturing everything that was going on. We took him to the Barmy Army pub one night and he loved it.\"\n\nThe Bakers have strong ties to Australia. The family has housed Australian overseas players and Josh played in Sydney during the winter before he passed away.\n\nFor the first Ashes without Josh, there was nowhere else Lisa and Paul wanted to be.\n\n\"Life is too short,\" says Lisa. \"Josh was an only child. We just thought 'let's do it'.\n\n\"It's tough because the memories keep popping up on my phone. They're wonderful, but they absolutely break your heart. I look back at them and that was when we were happy. That's so difficult. Not that we're not happy now, but it's very different.\"",

One lucky fan in attendance will also receive £60,000 from the tournament sponsor, as will Prostate Cancer UK.\n\nWhat is dartitis and what causes it?\n\nLittler entered as favourite off the back of winning six major finals in 2025.\n\nLuke Humphries, Littler's predecessor as both world champion and world number one, faced Littler in three finals this year and is the current world number two.\n\nWorld number three Michael van Gerwen is also in the mix, looking to avenge last year's final defeat and add to his three world titles, with his most recent coming in 2019.\n\nYoung players making a big run at the World Championship include Josh Rock and Gian van Veen, whose respective form saw them both enter the world's top 12 before the tournament.\n\nBeau Greaves topped this year's Women's Series and carried the highest hopes of becoming only the second female player to win a match in the tournament, after Fallon Sherrock won twice at the event in December 2019.\n\nShe took 22nd seed Daryl Gurney to a deciding set but just fell short of a place in the second round.\n\nThree qualification places were on offer from the Women's Series, along with a spot for the Women's Matchplay winner, a title taken by Lisa Ashton.\n\nAshton lost 3-0 to 2023 world champion Michael Smith in the first round on 11 December.\n\nWith Greaves qualifying in her own right as runner-up on the development tour, that meant Women's Series runner-up Sherrock, Noa-Lynn van Leuven in fourth and Gemma Hayter, who finished fifth, joined third-placed Ashton.\n\nVan Leuven, who became the first transgender player to appear at the tournament last year, was beaten by two-time champion Peter Wright this time.\n\nSherrock lost in straight sets in the first round to Dave Chisnall, while Hayter took a set off Northern Ireland's World Cup winner Rock in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nThe format is set play, unlike other tournaments which are a race to a number of legs.\n\nA set consists of the best of five legs or race to three.\n\nOnly in matches where players are level on sets and legs in the deciding set do players need to win by two clear legs.\n\nFirst and second round: Best of five sets\n\nThird and fourth round: Best of seven sets\n\nQuarter-finals: Best of nine sets\n\nPhil Taylor is the most successful player in the history of the PDC World Darts Championship, winning 14 of his 16 world titles between 1995 and 2013.\n\nHis previous two titles came before a group of leading players broke away from the British Darts Organisation to form their own governing body, now known as the PDC, in 1993.\n\nThe past five years have produced five different world champions, with English trio Littler, Humphries and Smith winning the past three.\n\nLittler and Humphries will hope to join the exclusive club of players to have won multiple PDC world titles, with only six managing to achieve that feat so far.\n\nTwo players hit nine-darters during the 2025 World Darts Championship.\n\nDutchman Christian Kist was the first player to hit one, doing so in a first-round defeat by Madars Razma.\n\nAustralia's Damon Heta hit one in the third round, but like Kist it came in a defeat as he went out to Luke Woodhouse.\n\nThroughout the tournament, there will be daily round-ups on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be live text coverage of the biggest matches as the tournament progresses.\n\nDuring Thursday's opening night, there was a dedicated preview show on BBC Radio 5 Live, featuring interviews with Littler, Humphries and Van Gerwen. Presenter James Gregg will provide updates on BBC Sounds throughout the competition.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nAsk Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.\n\nWe want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.\n\nThe team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.\n\nWe will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.\n\nOur coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.\n\nHow do darts world rankings work?\n\nWho is Arsenal teenager Salmon?\n\nWhy is Steve Smith wearing black tape under his eyes?\n\nWhen is the FA Cup third round draw?",

    "description": "BBC Sport reflects on a stellar year for South Africa which threatens to be overshadowed by a lack of home Test cricket.",
    "fullText": "From a certain vantage point, the health of Test cricket in South Africa appears terminal.\n\nFor the first time since sporting isolation during apartheid, there will be no red-ball action in the country this summer. Instead, fans must make do watching Indian-owned T20 franchises compete in the SA20.\n\nThe next time the Proteas take the field in whites on home soil will be October 2026, 21 months after hosting Pakistan in January this year.\n\nAnd yet the Test team itself has rarely looked in better shape, with 2025 proving a watershed year.\n\nRyan Rickelton registered his country's first double century for nine years as Pakistan were swept 2–0. In June, a sublime fourth-innings 136 from Aiden Markram, allied to a nine-wicket match haul from Kagiso Rabada, carried South Africa to a five-wicket victory over Australia in the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's.\n\nAnd with the choker's tag finally dislodged, and momentum behind them, South Africa are on track to qualify for another WTC final.\n\nWiaan Mulder threatened Brian Lara's record for the highest Test score when he declared himself on 367 against Zimbabwe in July. In October, Keshav Maharaj bagged a seven-for in Rawalpindi to square the series with Pakistan.\n\nA month later, Simon Harmer claimed 17 wickets in two Tests as South Africa beat India 2-0 in their own backyard, becoming the first South African team to win away in India since 2000.\n\n\"It's been a remarkable period for us,\" says Sunuran Muthusamy, the spin-bowling all-rounder who scored his maiden century in the 408-run win in the second Test against India.\n\n\"We're straight into the SA20 so it's hard to really take stock. But in the small moments when we've had a chance to reflect, we know that we've found a great formula. It feels like things are really clicking.\"",

These were really close friends and key parts of his backroom team, so there was more than one element to their relationship with AJ.\n\nWe know Ghami, who runs a gym in London, has been around AJ for about 10 years. He was an integral part of the team, as his strength and conditioning coach.\n\nAyodele has been around even longer. He was a friend who trained alongside the former world heavyweight champion, and was with him all the time.\n\nIf you do the most basic of searches on social media, it will reveal the three of them together. It always seemed to be the three of them together. That's what makes this all so heartbreaking.",

    "fullText": "Every new year brings great expectations and hopes for boxing fans.\n\nWill we see the biggest fights? Are we finally going to get Anthony Joshua v Tyson Fury? Who will emerge as the next big star?\n\nHere BBC Sport picks out some bouts we want to see in 2026.\n\nRight it's the big one and the serial heartbreaker – Joshua v Fury.\n\nWe've come close before, several times, but this time we are filled with renewed optimism the heavyweight super-fight will happen.\n\nForget the fact neither man is world champion or that Fury, 37, has been retired for a year, or the fight is a few years late with Joshua now 36, we'd still really like to see it.\n\nIt would be a seminal moment for the two best British heavyweights of their era to face each other.\n\nAnd if it does happen, we expect it to be in the UK at the end of 2026.\n\nLightweight world champion Caroline Dubois is quickly emerging as the next major talent. Now aligned with Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), she made her promotional debut in December with an impressive win against Camilla Panatta.\n\nSurely unification fights are next for the 24-year-old and who is a better option than fellow Briton and WBO belt holder Terri Harper?\n\nThe pair don't seem to be the biggest fans of each other but now they're under the same promotional banner.\n\nBoth fight at pace and it has all the makings of a British boxing classic - never mind the fact they're both world champions.\n\nUnified super-featherweight Alycia Baumgardner is also an intriguing and fun option for either woman, although the 31-year-old American beat Harper in a title bout back in 2021.\n\nLight-welterweight Adam Azim will be in action live on BBC Two against Argentine Gustavo Daniel Lemos on 31 January, but it really is just about time for the unbeaten 23-year-old Briton to make a big step up.\n\nSheffield's Dalton Smith is a brilliant fight for Azim. The 28-year-old challenges for a world title on 10 January against Subriel Matias.\n\nShould Smith win, Slough-born Azim could face him in a world championship contest, but defeat would make it a massive must-win all-British encounter.\n\nThis is the fight for the boxing purists. Former bantamweight world champion Junto Nakatani's move to super-bantamweight in December was basically to pave the way for an all-Japanese world title super-fight with Naoya Inoue.\n\nMultiple world champion Inoue, 32, is widely considered the standout fighter in any weight division. No-one has got close to 'The Monster', but perhaps the 27-year-old Nakatani will be the man to do it.\n\nBoth are unbeaten, with 51 knockouts between them, and it could be a fight for the ages.\n\nWe were expecting this fight to happen in 2025, but boxing politics appeared to get in the way.\n\nLauren Price, 31, has been impeccable since turning professional and is already a unified champion at welterweight after just nine fights.\n\nThe only belt she doesn't have, Mikaela Mayer does. Unable to defend that WBO title against Price, Mayer casually jumped up to light-middleweight to become a three-weight world champion.\n\nMayer's success adds to the intrigue of a showdown with Price and the outspoken American, 35, may produce some verbal fireworks from the usually calm Welsh boxer.\n\nFabio Wardley is living the dream as a white-collar boxer turned heavyweight world champion.\n\nThe 31-year-old will be expected to have a low-risk first defence of his WBO title, but we'd really love to see the big-hitting Ipswich man in the ring with the division's brightest prospect in 20-year-old Moses Itauma.\n\nThey are likely to be two of the biggest figures in British boxing over the next five years and seem certain to meet at some stage.\n\nWhy not now, when Wardley has a world title to his name?\n\nConor Benn v Ryan Garcia or Lewis Crocker\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Love it or loathe it, the Battle of the Sexes-style event between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios has caused quite the stir.\n\nSabalenka, the women's world number one, faces 2022 Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios in an exhibition match on 28 December.\n\nThe event will be shown live on BBC One from 15:45 GMT.\n\nBBC Sport looks at the key questions going into the divisive match.\n\n'Battle of the Sexes' will not damage women's sport - Sabalenka\n\n'Mine was for social change, this is not' - King on Battle of the Sexes\n\nIf any women's player is going to beat Kyrgios, then you would expect it to be Sabalenka.\n\nThe 27-year-old Belarusian won four titles - including the US Open - and reached five other finals in a productive 2025 season.\n\nSabalenka has been one of the most effective servers this season, sitting in the top five for service games won, and has powerful groundstrokes.\n\nThe four-time major singles champion has the ability to hit through opponents, though she is still prone to being erratic from the baseline.\n\nOver the past season, where she won 59 of her 71 matches, Sabalenka has looked to introduce more variety into her game with drop-shots and coming forward to the net.\n\n\"I feel I will be more prepared than this guy,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\nThe exhibition will be the best of three sets, with a 10 point tie-breaker if it goes to a decider.\n\nAccording to organisers Evolve, data shows women players move about 9% slower on average than men, so the dimensions of Sabalenka's side of the court will be 9% smaller.\n\nEach player will only receive one serve in an attempt to restrict Kyrgios' power and speed advantage. He thinks that is the biggest leveller.\n\n\"You're taking my strength completely out of it,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Obviously she has a great serve herself, but from the back of the court things are a bit more even.\n\n\"The men's game is heavily reliant and dominated by first serve percentage and holding serve quite easy.\n\n\"So if you take that away the game becomes a bit more of a grind from the baseline and I think that slightly goes in her favour.\"\n\nSome see the match as harmless entertainment that will attract a newer, younger audience in the age of social media.\n\nOthers believe it is a misguided venture and, if Sabalenka loses, will create an opportunity for women's tennis to be belittled.\n\n\"I am not putting myself at any risk. We're there to have fun and bring great tennis. Whoever wins, wins,\" she said.\n\n\"It's so obvious that the man is biologically stronger than the woman, but it's not about that.\n\n\"This event is only going to help bring women's tennis to a higher level.\"\n\nCritics have questioned Kyrgios' suitability as the male protagonist, given he admitted assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2021 and has made a series of comments which have been considered misogynistic.\n\nKyrgios says he has not given \"one thought\" about the event potentially fuelling criticism of women's sport, and insists he is not concerned about losing.\n\n\"I'm never worried. I know how I've responded with things in my life,\" the former world number 13 said.\n\n\"This is all a bonus. I've lost tennis matches before, so it's not really a big deal.\"\n\nWith his booming first serve, easy power from the baseline and creative shot-making, Kyrgios' talent has never been in doubt.\n\nHis temperament has been questioned - as has his fitness in recent years.\n\nKyrgios missed most of the 2023 season and the entire 2024 campaign with a wrist injury that the Australian's surgeon thought would end his career.\n\nThe 30-year-old returned to action at January's Australian Open but has not played an ATP Tour singles match since March because of a knee injury.\n\n\"In the past year I've had to have some serious conversations with myself about how much I want to dedicate myself,\" he said.\n\n\"I was asking myself if I really wanted to put myself in a pressure cooker – every time I go out there is a lot of expectation.\n\n\"But I feel great. Now I'm in my 30s, I have to start looking after my body a little better.\n\n\"I know if I can play best of three with a tie-break that's a long way from where I was a year and a half ago.\"\n\nCynics have wondered exactly what the point of the event is.\n\nSabalenka and Kyrgios insist it is to attract a different audience to the sport, with an emphasis on fun, entertainment and celebrity culture.\n\n\"There are question marks - and that scares people,\" Kyrgios said.\n\n\"For us, it is exciting and gives us that thrill. I think events like this need to happen \n\nThe event, being held at the 17,000-seater Coca-Cola Arena, is on track to be sold out.\n\nTickets range from about £100 in the upper tier stands to upwards of £600 on courtside benches.\n\n\"Sport and entertainment is the same thing – people come to watch sport for the unknown, that's why it is not played on paper,\" Kyrgios said.\n\n\"Whether it's good or bad, they want to remember something they are going to see in everyday life.\"\n\nBillie Jean King, who beat Bobby Riggs in the second Battle of the Sexes match in 1973, hopes it will be a \"great\" match but says it is \"not the same\" as her era-defining event.\n\nKing's victory over former Wimbledon champion Riggs - a 55-year-old self-proclaimed chauvinist - was a landmark moment in the fight for gender equality and laid the path for equal pay at the top of the game.\n\n\"Ours was about social change; culturally, where we were in 1973. This one is not,\" King told BBC Sport.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "David Storch wants to be the next owner of Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nHaving made a bid to buy the Owls last Friday, Storch faces competition from two other parties, including former Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley.\n\nBut who is he, and what is his plan for the Hillsborough club?\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BBC Sheffield, the American introduced himself and his vision - which appears to be very different from that of former owner Dejphon Chansiri.\n\n\"We have a desire to do things right, that means setting the tone at the top,\" Storch said.\n\n\"Having excellence in everything we do and a quality product — at the stadium, the training ground and academy.\n\n\"We'll bring in the right CEO (chief executive officer). We want to make sure we bring in the right sporting director.\"\n\nChansiri would often baulk at the idea of a sporting director and the club has not had a CEO since Katrien Meire left in 2019.\n\nStorch and Ashley are believed to be joined by Dunfermline owner James Bord in the running to take over at Wednesday.\n\nThe Championship club entered administration in October, which ended Chansiri's decade-long ownership.\n\nJoint-administrator Kris Wigfield said in a statement last Friday that \"genuine progress is being made\" to name a preferred bidder but with 2026 on the horizon, it is unclear who will lead the club into the future.\n\nStorch, who has also worked in the aviation services industry, is the founder and managing partner of investment firm Arise Capital Partners, working alongside his son Michael.\n\nBut why are they trying to buy one of English football's most recognisable yet troubled football clubs?\n\n\"When we went to the Wednesday game on 5 November (against Norwich), I just couldn't believe the atmosphere, the energy, the singing, the fan engagement,\" Storch said.\n\n\"Here's a team that not only is in the cellar, but you know, for certain, about to be relegated due to the point deductions.\n\n\"We came away unbelievably excited about what we saw.\"\n\nAs it happens, Storch has come close to buying several English Football League (EFL) clubs.\n\n\"We started focusing on US sports and then we started looking at English football about two-and-a-half years ago,\" he said.\n\n\"We've given serious consideration to three different clubs. We did go down the path with Rob Couhig at Reading. We took a look at Blackpool, although we quickly dismissed that one.\n\n\"Then we submitted an offer team with Gareth Bale to buy Cardiff City and actually reached agreement with Vincent Tan to purchase the club. Unfortunately, he decided to hold on and we never got that transaction complete.\"\n\nSheffield Wednesday placed in administration\n\nSheff Wed delay move to name preferred bidder\n\nSheff Wed 'days from takeover' with Ashley leading contender\n\nTaking on Sheffield Wednesday would be a significant challenge. It is a club that has not been in the Premier League for 25 years.\n\nIn that period they have been relegated to League One three times and, given their points deductions in the Championship this season, they will almost certainly make that four.\n\nBut Storch has said he has done his homework and has a clear strategy should he take over the club.\n\n\"You'll see that we have a blueprint for proper governance, fan engagement, financial stability, sustainability and football strategy,\" he said.\n\n\"I've bought into it 100% and I've insisted that all of my partners here, all of my team that's surrounding me, that they buy into that as well.\n\n\"I think the academy is critical to our strategy. We'll look to make improvements there so that players can have the right environment in which to train.\"\n\nThere had been talk of Storch joining forces with another American businessman, John McEvoy - but he revealed his bid for Wednesday has been made in partnership with Tom Costin, the co-founder and managing partner of Owl Ventures.\n\nThe company, whose name is a coincidence and not linked to Wednesday's nickname, describes itself as \"the largest venture capital firm in the world focused on education technology with over $2 billion assets under management\".\n\nCostin is an investor with the Blue Crow Sports Group - a multi-club football ownership and investment platform with controlling interests in French club Le Havre, Spanish side CD Leganes and Cancun FC in Mexico. Costin is also a board director at Le Havre.\n\n\"We recognise that this is a long journey - this is not a short term fix,\" Storch added.\n\n\"We have confidence between Tom and I, that between us, we have enough capital to get this thing going, and our plan is that as we sustain the team, and as we start making progress on the pitch, get back up in the Championship, it will be possible for us to go ahead and raise additional capital.\n\n\"I'm not doing this to own a football club. I'm doing this to make a difference. I want to give people something to feel proud about.\"\n\nStorch confirmed he made an offer for the club on Friday and said he is now waiting to hear from the administrators.\n\nThe main topic of discussion among fans currently is whether the preferred bidder will meet the EFL's '25p in the pound' rule - which requires that a club exiting administration must pay its unsecured creditors a minimum of 25p for every pound owed - to avoid a further 15-point deduction in the future.\n\n\"We've put in an offer. We feel that it's a fair offer and satisfies our interpretation of the rules and the laws of the land,\" Storch said.\n\n\"We will not move forward with a 15-point deduction. The offer that we've put in has a requirement that stipulates that we will not accept the 15-point reduction.\"\n\nThere were also recent reports suggesting the process involving the EFL's 'Owners' and Directors' Test' - plus the introduction of a new football regulator - could be a long one.\n\nWhile Storch was CEO of AAR, an aviation services company, an employee reportedly bribed the Nepalese and South African governments, leading to the company agreeing a $55m settlement in 2024.\n\nWill that be a stumbling block?\n\n\"My lawyer doesn't think so,\" Storch said.\n\n\"The circumstances that happened at the company were rather unfortunate. I have a 40-year business career that is unblemished. This was a lower-level employee that did some things they shouldn't have done. The company self-reported it.\n\n\"What I'm all about here is giving the fans something really exceptional, and restoring the past glory. I've never been rejected from anything in my life.\"\n\nLatest Sheffield Wednesday news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Sheffield Wednesday content on BBC Sounds",

He is highly rated for his pace, strength and directness.\n\nCity are in the Premier League title race with Arsenal, and signing the 25-year-old would boost their chances of success this season.\n\nThey are currently just two points behind the Gunners in the league table after a run of five consecutive wins.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot has faced challenge after challenge this season, from Liverpool's horrid run of nine defeats in 12 to Mohamed Salah's explosive interview at Leeds.\n\nHow Slot deals without Alexander Isak is the next big question.\n\nThe Swede has hardly had a flying start to life at Anfield since making the £125m move from Newcastle in the summer, but the movement and finish for his goal against Tottenham on Saturday showed exactly why Liverpool signed him.\n\n\"You need to be at the top of the game to impact a game. And it took months before we could bring him up. We always knew it would take him time. And that's why it's so unlucky that he's now injured,\" said Slot.\n\n\"We all saw he was getting closer and closer to the player that he was last season at Newcastle.\"\n\nSlot said it is a \"long injury\" and Isak would be out for \"a couple of months\" and that is probably the best case scenario for Liverpool. It will, in all likelihood, be March by the time Isak can play football again.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Liverpool will make a move for another attacker in January, with expensive solutions to short-term problems not part of the club model.\n\nHugo Ekitike is also thriving with eight league goals this season, with Slot saying the 23-year-old has \"already adapted to the Premier League.\"\n\nAsked about the possibility of recalling Harvey Elliott - who hasn't played since October - from Aston Villa, Slot said: \"Harvey is an Aston Villa player and he is supposed to be going there for a year. If the question is about him then the best thing to ask is at Villa, who are doing quite well by the way.\"\n\nIsak has only made 10 starts for Liverpool since signing but with him now out of contention and Salah away on duty at the African Cup of Nations, Slot may be forced into a tactical restructure to deal with the Swede's absence.",

    "fullText": "England are once again left playing for pride and places in the last two Tests of an Ashes series down under.\n\nAustralia have an unassailable 3-0 lead following victory in Adelaide, with matches in Melbourne and Sydney to come.\n\nUsing data from analysts CricViz, here are five charts that help explain how England's latest torturous tour of Australia unravelled in just 11 days of cricket...\n\nDespite question marks over Australia's top order leading into the series, they have significantly outperformed their England counterparts - the hosts' top-three batters scoring 666 runs at an average of 41.6 compared to 436 at 24.2 by the tourists.\n\nOf course, this can mostly be attributed to Australia's masterstroke borne out of necessity when number five Travis Head was promoted to open in the second innings of the first Test in Perth because of Usman Khawaja's back spasms.\n\nHead hit one of the all-time great Ashes centuries to win the match inside two days and justified his continued promotion to opener with a sublime 170 in Adelaide.\n\nJake Weatherald, who made his debut in Perth, made a vital 72 in Brisbane amid more meagre returns, while number three Marnus Labuschagne has hit two fifties.\n\nBouncing back from a pair in Perth, England opener Zak Crawley has scored 214 runs in the past two Tests.\n\nBut fellow opener Ben Duckett is having a dismal series - 97 runs at 16.16 - while frenetic number three Ollie Pope is not faring much better and could be dropped.\n\nBooze, beach, beaten - how England lost the Ashes\n\nMentality is reason for England's losing streak in Australia - McGrath\n\nEngland have adopted an aggressive style with the bat since head coach Brendon McCullum took over in 2022 - yes, that word again, 'Bazball'.\n\nAustralia have actually scored at a higher run-rate than England so far - 4.34 v 3.78 - and played slightly more attacking shots - 34% compared to 31%.\n\nThose stats can in part be put down to match situations - for example Australia needing only 65 in their second innings in Brisbane and therefore able to attack and reach their target in 10 overs.\n\nThe key difference between the sides has been how successful they have been on the attack - Australia's average of 46.9 when playing attacking shots is far better than England's 31.4.\n\nEngland have shown more willingness to adapt since their second innings in Brisbane, but are struggling in defence too.\n\nThe tourists have lost 18 wickets while looking to defend across the series - equivalent to a dismissal every 37 defensive shots. Australia have lost seven such wickets - once in every 64 defensive shots.\n\nEngland's hyped - and hyper-fast - pace attack shone in dismissing Australia for 132 in their first innings of the first Test in Perth, but have struggled to be as effective since.\n\nIn the first 30 overs of an innings with the new ball, Australia's pace bowlers have taken 32 wickets at an average of 22.8, compared to 23 at 32.2 by England.\n\nEngland's declining threat with the new ball could be partly explained by their inability to find the correct length to bowl at on each surface since that first day in Perth.\n\nComplaints from commentators and pundits that England have frequently bowled too short are backed up by comparing the sides' accuracy on hitting a good length - defined as 5-7m from the stumps.\n\nAustralia's bowlers have landed 30% of their deliveries in this zone throughout the series, with England doing so just 23% of the time, and have therefore put the tourists' batters under more sustained pressure.\n\nEven before Marnus Labuschagne decided to have a one-man competition with himself for screamer of the series, Australia have been clearly superior in the field.\n\nThe hosts have taken 47 and dropped eight of 55 chances - a success rate of 85% compared to England's 77% (33 catches, 10 drops).\n\nHalf of England's dropped chances happened during a miserable day two of the second Test at the Gabba...\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

The catch is that, as England head coach, he hasn't seen much more of Palmer at international level - just 64 minutes in the World Cup qualifier win against Andorra in June.\n\nA lingering groin problem meant that, against Everton, Palmer was making only his fourth Premier League start of the season, scoring his first goal since September. And in his absence, Tuchel's options for the number 10 role have expanded.\n\nTuchel may have given a clue to his future thinking with the way he voted in that Fifa Best poll, placing England captain Harry Kane as top choice, followed by Palmer and Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele.\n\nPalmer offers England the X-factor.

    "fullText": "Golfer Rory McIlroy has been voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2025 after clinching the career Grand Slam and playing a key role in Europe's Ryder Cup win.\n\nThe 36-year-old from Northern Ireland achieved golfing immortality in April when he won the Masters at Augusta National to complete the set of all four majors.\n\nHe became just the sixth man - and first European - to achieve the Slam, joining Americans Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, and South Africa's Gary Player, in accomplishing the feat.\n\nHaving won the US Open, The Open and US PGA Championship by 2014, McIlroy had to wait another 11 years to make his \"dreams come true\".\n\nHe then played a key role in Europe's first Ryder Cup win in the United States since 2012, contributing three and a half points to his team's triumph.\n\nMcIlroy also delighted his home crowd by winning the Irish Open for a second time, with further successes at the Players Championship and the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, before topping off a stellar year with his seventh Race to Dubai title.\n\n\"Wow,\" McIlroy said after receiving the award. \"First of all, I would like to congratulate all of the other finalists. I know how much hard work and dedication it takes, so it is a pleasure to just be in this room. I feel truly honoured to just be a part of it.\n\n\"2025 has been the year I made my dreams come true. From Augusta to the Ryder Cup and everything in between. It's the year dreams are made of.\"\n\nEngland rugby union player Ellie Kildunne came second, with Formula 1 driver Lando Norris in third.\n\nJust minutes before collecting his individual award, McIlroy - along with Tommy Fleetwood - collected the Team of the Year award after Team Europe were honoured for their Ryder Cup success.",

    "fullText": "The NFL has held at least one match on Christmas Day every year since 2020, with three 25 December fixtures scheduled in 2025.\n\nIt has previously held matches on the holiday, but between 1989 and 2019 would only occasionally schedule regular-season games on that date. This only tended to take place in years when Christmas Day would fall on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday.\n\nEarlier this season, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that from this year onwards there would be three games held every year on 25 December.\n\nSince 2021, two or three games have taken place on Christmas Day each year, with this year being a three-game day, much like in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAll three Christmas Day matches are between teams that have strong rivalries.\n\nThe Washington Commanders will host the Dallas Cowboys in the first game of the day, with the Minnesota Vikings playing at home against the Detroit Lions in the second.\n\nIn the third and final game of the day the Kansas City Chiefs face the Denver Broncos.\n\nWhile all three games kick off on Christmas Day in America, because of time zone differences the Chiefs-Broncos game will actually start in the early hours of 26 December at 01:15 GMT.\n\nStreaming site Netflix will show the first two games, as it did in 2024. The third match will be shown on Prime Video.\n\nIn 1971, the NFL held its first two Christmas Day matches following the merger between the American Football League and National Football League in the previous year.\n\nThose two matches were play-off games and the unpopularity of the decision to host the Christmas Day double-header led to an 18-year gap before matches were played again on 25 December.\n\nThursday, 25 December 18:00: Dallas Cowboys @ Washington Commanders\n\nThursday, 25 December 21:30: Detroit Lions @ Minnesota Vikings\n\nFriday, 26 December 01:15: Denver Broncos @ Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy are there NFL matches on Thanksgiving?\n\nWhy do some NFL rookies struggle in their second year?\n\nWhat are the differences between NFL wide receivers and tight ends?\n\nHow does studying game film work in American football?",

    "description": "Comment: After the year of his life, the award should go to Rory McIlroy – though it does not make it a scandal if the public decides to crown someone else",
    "fullText": "Rory McIlroy will be feeling confident when he takes his seat in the audience at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award tonight. We will know that simply because of his presence in the room, and because it is an honour that still carries enough significance and prestige that you want to be there if there’s a good chance you’re going to win.\n\nOthers may disagree. McIlroy, in the past, has been among them. But then, for some, bashing the Sports Personality of the Year contest is as much of an annual ritual as the prize itself, an opportunity to take cheap shots at the BBC, among other things.\n\nMcIlroy has enjoyed an exceptional year, the stuff of dreams, spearheaded by two successes at the Masters and Ryder Cup so astonishing that they may as well have been scripted. There’s no argument against that.\n\nHe won the Masters but did so on an agonising final round that displayed his vulnerabilities and the strength to overcome them, the qualities that make him such an endearing, inspiring champion. Leading Europe to an away Ryder Cup victory, against that American crowd at Bethpage Black, further strengthens his credentials and claim to a season that stands above the rest.\n\nAnd with McIlroy, there is also the sense of if he isn’t crowned SPOTY this year, then when will he ever be? There may be an acknowledgement of legacy and past achievements now that he has completed golf’s career slam. Certainly, given Andy Murray won SPOTY three times and Lewis Hamilton has done so twice, few would argue that McIlroy would not belong in their company in terms of British sporting greats of the past 20 years.\n\nSo, sure, the Northern Irishman should probably win, but this is also a public vote, decided on the night, and the history of this award can tell us it is rarely that straightforward.\n\nAt which point, it is worth considering what may happen should McIlroy lose out, or, rather, what the reaction would be depending on who he could lose out to. The Daily Mail has already declared there would be a “stain” on SPOTY should McIlroy not win the award this year.\n\nWhy? Yes, McIlroy has the strongest case in terms of his achievements. Yes, his victory at Augusta and what Europe achieved at Bethpage Black stirred emotions and created unforgettable drama. But, increasingly, the biggest factor in SPOTY voting can be the divide between sport that is behind a paywall and sport that is open to the largest audience possible, and it is a line that McIlroy, through no fault of his own, falls on the wrong side of.\n\nIt is why Chloe Kelly or Hannah Hampton (unless they split the vote) may stand as the biggest threat to McIlroy after another major tournament victory for the Lionesses. It is why Ellie Kildunne is an excellent outside contender, and why her world champion Red Roses may beat both Europe’s Ryder Cup team and the Lionesses to team of the year.\n\nSport is ultimately at its best when it brings people together. Its power is greatest when it can uplift and inspire. Ultimately, the most-watched moment of 2025 was Hampton saving from Aitana Bonmati and Mariona Caldentey and Kelly thumping her penalty into the net as the Lionesses won the Euros again – becoming the first England football team to win a major tournament on foreign land. The victory that had within it the capacity to influence society was the Red Roses lifting the World Cup at a sold-out Twickenham, a dominant, jubilant team celebrating how it had broken down barriers while demonstrating that strength and athleticism come in different shapes and sizes.\n\nAn accusation often levelled at the BBC is that its diminished offering of live sport means it has lost other events that consistently conjured this magic, such as the Masters. But in turn, the decision to platform the Women’s Euros and Women’s Rugby World Cup has seen audiences, particularly female viewership, hit record numbers. The success of a Lionesses or Red Roses team can now become a national event in the same way as men’s football or men’s rugby. It’s almost as if making live sport accessible and these athletes visible, following decades of marginalisation and catering to the male audience, has brought in new fans and levels of interest across a broader range.\n\nThis should be celebrated. But then, this is the BBC. To some, even the all-female presenting line-up of tonight’s event, in Gabby Logan, Clare Balding and Alex Scott, is evidence of an organisation and SPOTY award that has gone overly woke and lost its shine. You can probably imagine, then, what the reaction would be should either Kelly or Hampton follow Beth Mead in 2022 and Mary Earps in 2023 and win, even if more than 16 million people watched the Lionesses’ latest tournament victory.\n\nHow the votes between Kelly and Hampton are split will be another factor as, for the first time, two members of the same team have been named on the final shortlist. Why both? It may be down to England’s bewildering summer of survival and Kelly’s rather curious role within it, the star who delivered on the biggest moments but yet did not start a match. Over the course, Hampton was integral to keeping the Lionesses alive, and the goalkeeper was unlucky not to win player of the Euro 2025 – she was certainly England’s.\n\nThe truth is that any of the six on the final shortlist would deserve to win. That includes the two individual world champions, one crowned at the start of the year and the other less than a fortnight ago, in Luke Littler and Lando Norris, both of whom are immensely popular as well. But, after the year of his life, it should be McIlroy. It does not, though, make it a scandal or bring a “stain” on the award if the public decides to crown someone else.",

Others question his sanity. Almost nobody gives him a chance.\n\n\"I worry about Jake's health,\" trainer Joe Gallagher tells BBC Sport.\n\nFormer world champion and Team GB coach Richie Woodhall says Joshua is the \"hardest puncher\" he has ever had on the pads.\n\nLiverpool's two-division champion Natasha Jonas calls the whole event simply \"wild\".\n\nThat tension with boxing's old guard irritates Paul. In fight week, he bristled at the mention of criticism, describing detractors as a \"peanut gallery that doesn't exist\" and insisting the question of whether he belongs no longer concerns him.\n\nOn paper, Paul-Joshua is the biggest mismatch to headline a boxing event.\n\nYet inside Paul's camp, the tone is very different. There is a belief the 28-year-old has improved far more than the public realise.",

    "fullText": "Keir Starmer’s office claims UK still in ‘active conversations’ about deal for tech industries in both countries to cooperate\n\nDowning Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "Companies such as Udio, Suno and Klay will let you use AI to make new music based on existing artists’ work. It could mean more royalties – but many are worried\n\nThis was the year that AI-generated music went from jokey curiosity to mainstream force. Velvet Sundown, a wholly AI act, generated millions of streams; AI-created tracks topped Spotify’s viral chart and one of the US Billboard country charts; AI “artist” Xania Monet “signed” a record deal. BBC Introducing is usually a platform for flesh-and-blood artists trying to make it big, but an AI-generated song by Papi Lamour was recently played on the West Midlands show. And jumping up the UK Top 20 this month is I Run, a track by dance act Haven, who have been accused of using AI to imitate British vocalist Jorja Smith (Haven claim they simply asked the AI for “soulful vocal samples”, and did not respond to an earlier request to comment).\n\nThe worry is that AI will eventually absorb all creative works in history and spew out endless slop that will replace human-made art and drive artists into penury. Those worries are being deepened by how the major labels, once fearful of the technology, are now embracing it – and heralding a future in which ordinary listeners have a hand in co-creating music with their favourite musicians.\n\nAI music platforms analyse huge amounts of recorded music in order to learn its sounds, structures and expressions, and then allow users to create their own AI-generated music via text or speech prompts. You might ask for a moody R&B song about a breakup sung by a female vocalist, and it will come up with a decent approximation of one, because it’s absorbed hundreds of such songs.\n\nArtists and labels initially saw AI as the biggest existential threat since Napster-fuelled piracy: if not a replacement for human creativity, then certainly a force that could undermine its value. Gregor Pryor, a managing partner at legal firm Reed Smith, says background music for things such as advertising, films and video games, where you’re not relating to a personality as you would in pop music, “is where the real damage will be done” first of all. “People will ask: why would I pay anyone to compose anything?”\n\nAware of the scale of the shift, last year the Recording Industry Association of America, representing the three major labels, initiated legal action against AI music companies Suno and Udio for copyright infringement, alleging they had trained their AI platforms on the labels’ artists without their permission. But then there was an extraordinary about-turn. They didn’t just settle the matter out of court – Universal Music Group (UMG) then partnered with Udio, and Warner Music Group (WMG) with Udio and Suno. They also have deals in place with AI company Klay, the first to get all three major labels on board, adding Sony Music (discussions with indie labels are ongoing). WMG chief executive Robert Kyncl has said these recent deals are to ensure the “protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters” and to fuel “new creative and commercial possibilities” for them, while UMG chief Lucien Grainge heralded “a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish and create incredible experiences for fans”.\n\nKyncl made another bold statement as to why these deals are taking place: “Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. The democratisation of music creation.”\n\nAnnouncing its Universal tie-in, Udio chief executive Andrew Sanchez has said Udio users will be able to “create [music] with an artist’s voice and style”: so not just create the aforementioned moody R&B song, but one with a specific existing artist’s voice. He also says Udio will allow users to “remix and reimagine your favourite songs with AI … take your favourite artists, songs or styles and combine them in novel ways. In our internal experimentation, the team has gotten some truly remarkable and unusual results that will definitely delight.”\n\nKlay meanwhile states that “fans can mould their musical journeys in new ways”, but it’s essentially the same offering: a subscription service where you can manipulate the music of others, or create your own from it. Ary Attie, Klay’s founder and chief executive, says his company will properly compensate artists whose work is used, and won’t supplant the work of human musicians: “This technology is not going to change any of that.”\n\nKlay is a rarity in that it signed up all three major labels before it started training its AI system on their music: “A core part of our philosophy,” Attie says. He argues that rival AI companies – he doesn’t name names – have been “acting in a way that doesn’t respect the work of artists, and then being forced into a corner”. Suno did not respond to an interview request; Udio claimed its executives were “extremely swamped” and therefore unable to answer questions. The current, and synchronised, messaging from labels and gen AI companies with licensing deals is that they all respect both art and artists and that their deals will reflect this.\n\nThey are also positioning gen AI as the single biggest democratising leap ever in remix culture, effectively enabling everyone to become musically creative. The counterargument is that, by lowering all barriers to entry and by allowing the manipulation of a song or a musician’s character at scale, it vastly devalues and negates the creative act itself.\n\nBut what do musicians actually think of the prospect of their work being used to train AI, and reworked by the general public? “Everybody should be selling or licensing their voice and their skills to these companies,” Dave Stewart of Eurythmics argued to me this week. “Otherwise they’re just going to take it anyway.” That view is directly countered by the major labels and AI companies, who have insisted artists and songwriters get to opt in to have their music made available, and if they do, get royalties when their music is used to train AI, or manipulated by users on platforms such as Udio, Suno and Klay.\n\nOthers take a grimmer view about how these companies might reshape the industry. Irving Azoff, legendarily forthright artist manager and founder of the Music Artists Coalition in the US, responded to the Universal/Udio deal with biting cynicism. “We’ve seen this before – everyone talks about ‘partnership,’ but artists end up on the sidelines with scraps,” he said. In the wake of the same deal, the Council of Music Makers in the UK accused the major labels of “spin” and called for a more robust set of artist-label agreements. And the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance says there is a disturbing “lack of transparency” around the deals (though more detail is likely to emerge on what users can do with any music they create, and any potential commercial uses of it).\n\nCatherine Anne Davies, who records as the Anchoress and also sits on the board of directors at the Featured Artists Coalition (FAC), has many reservations here. “Most people don’t even want their work to be used for training AI,” she says. “I’m on the dystopian side, or maybe what I call the realist side of things. I’m interested in the way that AI can be assistive in the creative process – if it can make us more efficient, if it can streamline our processes. But generative AI for me, in terms of creative output, is a big no-no at the moment. I’m yet to be convinced.”\n\nMusician Imogen Heap feels that AI itself is not to be feared as a tool – she uses an AI she calls Mogen to listen to every aspect of her life, with a view to it being a creative partner (as explored in a recent Guardian article). To help address some of the issues, she has created Auracles, an artist-led, non-profit platform she hopes will be the place where the rights and permissions around AI are set out. It’s not enough to say you’re happy with your music being used by AI, she says – instead, what’s needed are “permissions that grow and evolve over time”.\n\nOther companies are cropping up with similar offers. “We must protect the artists at all costs,” says Sean Power, chief executive of Musical AI, who aims to give musicians “an exact portion of the influence they’re having on all the generative outputs” – meaning compensation every time even a tiny bit of one of their songs is used by a user of Udio et al.\n\nTerms of these deals are undisclosed, but labels are likely to be seeking settlement for any past use of their artists’ copyrights as well as an advance on future use, plus an equity stake in the platform. And while artists will be able to opt out of including their work, they probably won’t be consulted on these partnerships going ahead, with this lack of consultation being something that artist representative bodies such as FAC have been particularly critical of. “The big artists, the labels need to be nice to; those who have a platform will be consulted to some degree,” says a music licensing expert, speaking anonymously. “The very few, who as individual artists are able to make a dent on share price, will have approval.”\n\nI approached Universal, Sony and Warner about the specific concerns raised by artists here: namely limited transparency around the deals, their commercial terms and how opt-ins work; if there is a risk of gen AI undermining existing revenue sources; and if there is significant artist refusal to assign their works for gen AI training. None of the companies would comment on the record about the specifics. Though in an internal Universal memo about AI deals, sent to all staff earlier this year and seen by the Guardian, Grainge said “we will NOT license any model that uses an artist’s voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist’s existing songs without their consent.”\n\nThe Guardian understands that labels are currently having discussions with artists and their managers to better explain how these deals will work and why they believe they can bring in additional revenue, although they will need to convince artists that gen AI will not damage other sources of income, notably from streaming.\n\nBut it isn’t clear whether consumers will actually pay to play around with music in the way Udio and others hope they will. AI is the single biggest hype category in Silicon Valley right now, with an average of $2bn of venture capital investment going into AI companies every week in the first half of this year. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet (parent company of Google), recently warned of the catastrophic domino effect across the tech sector if this AI bubble bursts, a concern the Bank of England also recently raised.\n\nReed Smith’s Gregor Pryor argues that AI music could, counterintuitively, end up being positive for human musicians. “By its nature, AI is derivative and cannot create new music,” he says. “Some investors in music catalogues that I speak to say it’s good for artists, because music ‘verified’ as created by humans will have greater value.”\n\nArtists will frame their work as having an invaluable human essence, their music speaking entirely from the heart, but it will become incrementally more difficult for the casual listener to distinguish between music created by a human and that created by AI. The Guardian understands that radio stations and DJs are currently extremely nervous about AI-powered music slipping through their quality filters, effectively hoodwinking them and hanging question marks over how their playlists work. The example of Papi Lamour might force them to do much greater due diligence on what they put forward for airplay consideration. Or they could be the first trickles of a flood that roars through radio and streaming services as the boundaries between AI and human-created music crumble.\n\nDavies is especially worried about artists not thinking through the long-term implications of licensing to AI services. “We cannot think of ourselves selfishly as entities that will be unaffected, because the entire ecosystem will experience a knock-on effect financially. What about your fellow composers and creators? But also what about the generations to come after? Are we fucking this completely, just to make sure that we can pay our mortgages now?”\n\nAI’s current level of sophistication means it is really producing composites of existing music, creating a Frankenstein’s monster of melodies. However, when AGI (artificial general intelligence) finally arrives, with Anthropic co-founder Dario Amodei suggesting that could happen as soon as next year, we will be catapulted into an exhilarating and terrifying realm of uncertainty for the future and the purpose of human-created art.\n\n“It’s literally happening under our noses,” warns Davies. “We should be so much more concerned than we are.”",
