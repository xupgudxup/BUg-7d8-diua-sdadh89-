The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "Companies such as Udio, Suno and Klay will let you use AI to make new music based on existing artists’ work. It could mean more royalties – but many are worried\n\nThis was the year that AI-generated music went from jokey curiosity to mainstream force. Velvet Sundown, a wholly AI act, generated millions of streams; AI-created tracks topped Spotify’s viral chart and one of the US Billboard country charts; AI “artist” Xania Monet “signed” a record deal. BBC Introducing is usually a platform for flesh-and-blood artists trying to make it big, but an AI-generated song by Papi Lamour was recently played on the West Midlands show. And jumping up the UK Top 20 this month is I Run, a track by dance act Haven, who have been accused of using AI to imitate British vocalist Jorja Smith (Haven claim they simply asked the AI for “soulful vocal samples”, and did not respond to an earlier request to comment).\n\nThe worry is that AI will eventually absorb all creative works in history and spew out endless slop that will replace human-made art and drive artists into penury. Those worries are being deepened by how the major labels, once fearful of the technology, are now embracing it – and heralding a future in which ordinary listeners have a hand in co-creating music with their favourite musicians.\n\nAI music platforms analyse huge amounts of recorded music in order to learn its sounds, structures and expressions, and then allow users to create their own AI-generated music via text or speech prompts. You might ask for a moody R&B song about a breakup sung by a female vocalist, and it will come up with a decent approximation of one, because it’s absorbed hundreds of such songs.\n\nArtists and labels initially saw AI as the biggest existential threat since Napster-fuelled piracy: if not a replacement for human creativity, then certainly a force that could undermine its value. Gregor Pryor, a managing partner at legal firm Reed Smith, says background music for things such as advertising, films and video games, where you’re not relating to a personality as you would in pop music, “is where the real damage will be done” first of all. “People will ask: why would I pay anyone to compose anything?”\n\nAware of the scale of the shift, last year the Recording Industry Association of America, representing the three major labels, initiated legal action against AI music companies Suno and Udio for copyright infringement, alleging they had trained their AI platforms on the labels’ artists without their permission. But then there was an extraordinary about-turn. They didn’t just settle the matter out of court – Universal Music Group (UMG) then partnered with Udio, and Warner Music Group (WMG) with Udio and Suno. They also have deals in place with AI company Klay, the first to get all three major labels on board, adding Sony Music (discussions with indie labels are ongoing). WMG chief executive Robert Kyncl has said these recent deals are to ensure the “protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters” and to fuel “new creative and commercial possibilities” for them, while UMG chief Lucien Grainge heralded “a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish and create incredible experiences for fans”.\n\nKyncl made another bold statement as to why these deals are taking place: “Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. The democratisation of music creation.”\n\nAnnouncing its Universal tie-in, Udio chief executive Andrew Sanchez has said Udio users will be able to “create [music] with an artist’s voice and style”: so not just create the aforementioned moody R&B song, but one with a specific existing artist’s voice. He also says Udio will allow users to “remix and reimagine your favourite songs with AI … take your favourite artists, songs or styles and combine them in novel ways. In our internal experimentation, the team has gotten some truly remarkable and unusual results that will definitely delight.”\n\nKlay meanwhile states that “fans can mould their musical journeys in new ways”, but it’s essentially the same offering: a subscription service where you can manipulate the music of others, or create your own from it. Ary Attie, Klay’s founder and chief executive, says his company will properly compensate artists whose work is used, and won’t supplant the work of human musicians: “This technology is not going to change any of that.”\n\nKlay is a rarity in that it signed up all three major labels before it started training its AI system on their music: “A core part of our philosophy,” Attie says. He argues that rival AI companies – he doesn’t name names – have been “acting in a way that doesn’t respect the work of artists, and then being forced into a corner”. Suno did not respond to an interview request; Udio claimed its executives were “extremely swamped” and therefore unable to answer questions. The current, and synchronised, messaging from labels and gen AI companies with licensing deals is that they all respect both art and artists and that their deals will reflect this.\n\nThey are also positioning gen AI as the single biggest democratising leap ever in remix culture, effectively enabling everyone to become musically creative. The counterargument is that, by lowering all barriers to entry and by allowing the manipulation of a song or a musician’s character at scale, it vastly devalues and negates the creative act itself.\n\nBut what do musicians actually think of the prospect of their work being used to train AI, and reworked by the general public? “Everybody should be selling or licensing their voice and their skills to these companies,” Dave Stewart of Eurythmics argued to me this week. “Otherwise they’re just going to take it anyway.” That view is directly countered by the major labels and AI companies, who have insisted artists and songwriters get to opt in to have their music made available, and if they do, get royalties when their music is used to train AI, or manipulated by users on platforms such as Udio, Suno and Klay.\n\nOthers take a grimmer view about how these companies might reshape the industry. Irving Azoff, legendarily forthright artist manager and founder of the Music Artists Coalition in the US, responded to the Universal/Udio deal with biting cynicism. “We’ve seen this before – everyone talks about ‘partnership,’ but artists end up on the sidelines with scraps,” he said. In the wake of the same deal, the Council of Music Makers in the UK accused the major labels of “spin” and called for a more robust set of artist-label agreements. And the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance says there is a disturbing “lack of transparency” around the deals (though more detail is likely to emerge on what users can do with any music they create, and any potential commercial uses of it).\n\nCatherine Anne Davies, who records as the Anchoress and also sits on the board of directors at the Featured Artists Coalition (FAC), has many reservations here. “Most people don’t even want their work to be used for training AI,” she says. “I’m on the dystopian side, or maybe what I call the realist side of things. I’m interested in the way that AI can be assistive in the creative process – if it can make us more efficient, if it can streamline our processes. But generative AI for me, in terms of creative output, is a big no-no at the moment. I’m yet to be convinced.”\n\nMusician Imogen Heap feels that AI itself is not to be feared as a tool – she uses an AI she calls Mogen to listen to every aspect of her life, with a view to it being a creative partner (as explored in a recent Guardian article). To help address some of the issues, she has created Auracles, an artist-led, non-profit platform she hopes will be the place where the rights and permissions around AI are set out. It’s not enough to say you’re happy with your music being used by AI, she says – instead, what’s needed are “permissions that grow and evolve over time”.\n\nOther companies are cropping up with similar offers. “We must protect the artists at all costs,” says Sean Power, chief executive of Musical AI, who aims to give musicians “an exact portion of the influence they’re having on all the generative outputs” – meaning compensation every time even a tiny bit of one of their songs is used by a user of Udio et al.\n\nTerms of these deals are undisclosed, but labels are likely to be seeking settlement for any past use of their artists’ copyrights as well as an advance on future use, plus an equity stake in the platform. And while artists will be able to opt out of including their work, they probably won’t be consulted on these partnerships going ahead, with this lack of consultation being something that artist representative bodies such as FAC have been particularly critical of. “The big artists, the labels need to be nice to; those who have a platform will be consulted to some degree,” says a music licensing expert, speaking anonymously. “The very few, who as individual artists are able to make a dent on share price, will have approval.”\n\nI approached Universal, Sony and Warner about the specific concerns raised by artists here: namely limited transparency around the deals, their commercial terms and how opt-ins work; if there is a risk of gen AI undermining existing revenue sources; and if there is significant artist refusal to assign their works for gen AI training. None of the companies would comment on the record about the specifics. Though in an internal Universal memo about AI deals, sent to all staff earlier this year and seen by the Guardian, Grainge said “we will NOT license any model that uses an artist’s voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist’s existing songs without their consent.”\n\nThe Guardian understands that labels are currently having discussions with artists and their managers to better explain how these deals will work and why they believe they can bring in additional revenue, although they will need to convince artists that gen AI will not damage other sources of income, notably from streaming.\n\nBut it isn’t clear whether consumers will actually pay to play around with music in the way Udio and others hope they will. AI is the single biggest hype category in Silicon Valley right now, with an average of $2bn of venture capital investment going into AI companies every week in the first half of this year. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet (parent company of Google), recently warned of the catastrophic domino effect across the tech sector if this AI bubble bursts, a concern the Bank of England also recently raised.\n\nReed Smith’s Gregor Pryor argues that AI music could, counterintuitively, end up being positive for human musicians. “By its nature, AI is derivative and cannot create new music,” he says. “Some investors in music catalogues that I speak to say it’s good for artists, because music ‘verified’ as created by humans will have greater value.”\n\nArtists will frame their work as having an invaluable human essence, their music speaking entirely from the heart, but it will become incrementally more difficult for the casual listener to distinguish between music created by a human and that created by AI. The Guardian understands that radio stations and DJs are currently extremely nervous about AI-powered music slipping through their quality filters, effectively hoodwinking them and hanging question marks over how their playlists work. The example of Papi Lamour might force them to do much greater due diligence on what they put forward for airplay consideration. Or they could be the first trickles of a flood that roars through radio and streaming services as the boundaries between AI and human-created music crumble.\n\nDavies is especially worried about artists not thinking through the long-term implications of licensing to AI services. “We cannot think of ourselves selfishly as entities that will be unaffected, because the entire ecosystem will experience a knock-on effect financially. What about your fellow composers and creators? But also what about the generations to come after? Are we fucking this completely, just to make sure that we can pay our mortgages now?”\n\nAI’s current level of sophistication means it is really producing composites of existing music, creating a Frankenstein’s monster of melodies. However, when AGI (artificial general intelligence) finally arrives, with Anthropic co-founder Dario Amodei suggesting that could happen as soon as next year, we will be catapulted into an exhilarating and terrifying realm of uncertainty for the future and the purpose of human-created art.\n\n“It’s literally happening under our noses,” warns Davies. “We should be so much more concerned than we are.”",

Now it's a ruin.\n\n\"It demolished their home and business. As it stands they have nowhere to live. They're trying to repair and rebuild,\" adds Williamson.\n\n\"The sports bar is gone, basically. It's washed away. It needs a full rebuild.\"\n\nThe hurricane struck Jamaica on 28 October as a category five storm, resulting in 28 confirmed deaths.\n\nApproximately 1.5 million people - more than half of the nation's population - have been impacted.\n\nLenders have together put forward up to $6.7bn (£5bn) over three years to support Jamaica's recovery from Hurricane Melissa, alongside wider international aid efforts.\n\nWilliamson himself has launched a fundraising campaign and already received donations - including £1,000 from the auction of a signed glove - to help cover basics like food, clothing and temporary accommodation.\n\nHis brother will fly out in December, and Williamson hopes to follow.\n\nBefore he can board that plane, Williamson must face Barnsley's unbeaten Simpson - a tough assignment at a testing moment in his own career.",

The lawsuit accuses the BBC of broadcasting a “false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump,” calling it “a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence” the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

It included parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech, which took place before some of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.\n\nThe BBC spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, accusing it of defamation over editing of his Jan. 6 speech\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit Monday seeking $10 billion in damages from the BBC, accusing the British broadcaster of defamation as well as deceptive and unfair trade practices.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the BBC of broadcasting a “false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump,” calling it “a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence” the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt accused the BBC of “splicing together two entirely separate parts of President Trump’s speech on January 6, 2021” in order to ”intentionally misrepresent the meaning of what President Trump said.”\n\nAbrego Garcia is still hoping to find justice after his wrongful deportation, his lawyer says\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia wasn’t an activist and he didn’t choose to become locked into what has become one of the most contentious immigration issues of the Trump administration, his lawyer told The Associated Press.\n\nBut as he experiences some of the few days he’s had with his family since being sent erroneously to an El Salvador prison in March, his lawyer said he’s still hoping for a just resolution to his case.\n\n“He’s been through a lot, and he’s still fighting,” said his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg during an interview with AP following Abrego Garcia’s court-ordered release from detention last week. “What it is he can fight for is circumscribed by the law and by the great power of the United States government, but he’s still fighting.”\n\nAbrego Garcia’s mistaken deportation to El Salvador helped galvanize opposition to Trump’s immigration policies. He was held in a notoriously brutal prison there despite having no criminal record.\n\n▶ Read more about Abrego Garcia’s case\n\nSen. Mark Kelly’s attorney warns Trump administration of ‘dangerous overreach’\n\nThe attorney’s letter comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of the Democratic senator who was among a group of lawmakers in a video calling on military personnel to defy “illegal orders.”\n\n“There is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power,” wrote Paul J. Fishman in the letter to Navy Secretary John Phelan.\n\nTrump himself had lashed out at the lawmakers, who all have military backgrounds after years of service.\n\nKelly’s attorney warned of legal action if the department sought to pursue the senator in any forum — “criminal, disciplinary, or administrative.”\n\nFishman wrote they would “take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach.”\n\nSecret Service official says ballroom construction doesn’t yet meet agency’s security standards\n\nIn its Monday court filing, the Trump administration included a declaration from the deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service saying more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.”\n\nThe administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in-person without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among Trump’s political adversaries, but the lawsuit by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded group, is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) addition.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to block construction until the project goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification.\n\nTrump administration says White House ballroom construction is a matter of national security\n\nFor that reason, the construction project must continue, the Trump administration said in a court filing Monday.\n\nThe filing came in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt the project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress.\n\nExecutive order directs whole of government mobilization against drug traffickers\n\nThe order instructs the State and Treasury departments to pursue the financial assets of and sanctions on financial institutions and groups involved in fentanyl trafficking. It also calls for greater cooperation between the Pentagon and Justice Department on fentanyl and drug trafficking issues.\n\nThe order directs the homeland security secretary to “identify threat networks related to fentanyl smuggling” by using intelligence resources that in the past were devoted to the detection of other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe federal government by law has a wide range of national security and law enforcement capabilities to combat drug smuggling, including asset forfeiture, targeted arrests and surveillance of criminal organizations.\n\nThe Trump administration’s earlier this year designated some drug cartels as terror groups, a move that may unlock more coordination between the armed forces and domestic law enforcement but has been questioned by legal analysts over its scope and legality.\n\nWisconsin judge allows case against former Trump aides to proceed to trial\n\nA Wisconsin judge has ruled there is enough evidence to proceed to trial in a felony forgery case against an attorney and an aide to President Donald Trump related to action taken after 2020 election.\n\nThe judge on Monday at a preliminary hearing found there was probable cause to proceed with the charges after taking testimony from a special agent with the state Department of Justice who detailed the allegations.\n\nThe charges relate to attempts by the former aides to present a slate of Republican electors to Congress falsely claiming that Trump had won Wisconsin that year.\n\nFormer Trump attorney Jim Troupis and former Trump aide Mike Roman were in court for the hearing but did not testify. The judge postponed the preliminary hearing for a third person charged, Ken Chesebro, amid questions about what comments he made to prosecutors could be admitted in court.\n\nPence’s group urges Trump to fire RFK Jr.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence’s group Advancing American Freedom on Monday called on Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over what the group argues has been a slow-walked safety review of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nKennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary have pledged to review the drug’s safety but are facing mounting pressure from abortion opponents to move more quickly. Mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago, has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.\n\nIn a statement alongside Monday’s memo, the Republican Pence accused Kennedy of being unable or unwilling to keep promises to abortion opponents and said he should step aside.\n\nThe attacks come as Kennedy has faced criticism from both sides but also waves of support as he seeks to dramatically reshape the nation’s health agencies and target vaccines.\n\nTrump again says he’s ended hostilities between Thailand and Cambodia. But fighting continues\n\nThe two countries agreed to a ceasefire in July, and formalized the deal in October when Trump was in Malaysia. But lately, fighting has resumed. Trump on Friday said he had called the leaders and got them to agree to another truce -- but officials said heavy combat continues.\n\nNevertheless, Trump on Monday said in the Oval Office that “we were able to straighten that out.”\n\nThe two countries were “having a little problem yesterday,” Trump said. “I called them and I said, ‘look, fellas, relax. You gotta take it easy.’ They started the war again, and I got it ended.”\n\nTrump says he has asked Xi to free Jimmy Lai\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he feels “so badly” about Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong media mogul who on Monday was convicted in a landmark national security case.\n\nLai, 78, now could spend the rest of his life in prison. On Monday, Trump confirmed that he has brought up Lai’s case with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and asked for Lai’s release.\n\n“I spoke to President XI about it, and I asked to consider his release,” Trump said. “He’s not well, he’s an older man, and he’s not well, so I did put that request out. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nIn London and Washington, Jimmy Lai’s children have expressed gratitude for the support from the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump praises José Antonio Kast’s win in Chilean presidential election\n\nTrump touted the win by Kast, a far right conversative who comfortably defeated his left-of-center opponent in Sunday’s election, as a sign of his broader influence on politics across the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I look forward to pay my respects to him here,” Trump said of Kast. “He’s a very good person.”\n\nKast is the most conservative candidate to win Chile’s presidential election in 35 years. He won 58.2% of the votes on a campaign heavily centered on crime and immigration.\n\nTrump defends Syria’s new leader after attack that killed three Americans\n\nTrump said Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa “feels very badly” about an attack over the weekend that claimed the lives of two Iowa National Guard members and a U.S. civilian.\n\nTrump said the attack happened in a region of Syria that the new government doesn’t control.\n\n“This had nothing to do with him,” said Trump, speaking of al-Sharaa. He hosted al-Sharaa at the White House in November.\n\n“He feels very badly about it. He’s working on it. He’s a strong man, and this had nothing to do with the Syrian government,” Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. military and Trump have blamed the attack on the Islamic State group. Trump has threatened to retaliate.\n\nTrump defends FBI and calls Brown shooting a ‘school problem’\n\nTrump defended the FBI after a mass shooting at Brown University, arguing that questions about the case should be directed to officials at the Ivy League school in Rhode Island.\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that authorities do not yet know a motive in the shooting that killed two and injured others.\n\nPressed about why the FBI has not been able to identify a shooter, Trump called it a “school problem.” Brown “had their own guards, they had their own police and their own everything,” he said.\n\nTrump told reporters to “ask that question, really, to the school, not to the FBI,” which he said “came in after the fact.”\n\nHe said the FBI “will do a good job,” and cited the Charlie Kirk assassination as an example. In that case, the alleged killer’s family helped turn him in to authorities.\n\nTrump says the administration is considering changing how it treats marijuana\n\n“We are considering the idea because a lot of people want to see it,” the president said.\n\nTrump had said in August that he was reviewing whether the federal government should reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. Such a step could move the federal government closer to an approach already embraced by many states.\n\n“We are looking at that very strongly,” Trump said at the White House.\n\nTrump doubles down on criticizing Reiner and calls him ‘deranged’\n\nThe president was asked if he stood by his social media post in light of the pushback he was getting, including from those in his own party.\n\nUsing the third person, Trump said Reiner “was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned.”\n\n“I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way shape or form,” Trump said. “I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\nTrump signs executive order classifying fentanyl as a ‘weapon of mass destruction’\n\nHe signed the order in the Oval Office on Monday while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine, White House border czar Tom Homan and other top military officials.\n\nTrump says his administration is “formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is. No bomb does what this is doing.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the new designation would affect administration policy or what the legal implications would be for those impacted by fentanyl use or drug traffickers.\n\nThe term weapon of mass destruction has typically referred to nuclear, biological, chemical or kinetic threats capable of causing overwhelming and lasting damage to a population, infrastructure or environment. The term has also been hotly debated in American politics since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nTrump is recognizing 13 military service members with a Mexican Border Defense Medal\n\nThe president is in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump border czar Tom Homan, all of them hailing the border defense portion of his immigration crackdown.\n\nMilitary commanders and the award recipients looked on as Trump, Hegseth and Homan declared the border secure. Trump said his administration has “stopped the invasion in its tracks, and we are dismantling the cartels very rapidly.”\n\nHe added many hits from his 2024 campaign speech, blasting the immigration policies of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and declaring migrants who crossed the border “some of the worst people on Earth.”\n\nHoman praised “greatest president of my lifetime – yes, I said it.” Hegseth said the medal is a reprisal of a military honor awarded previously in the early 20th century\n\nTrump expresses optimism that Russia-Ukraine war is nearing the end\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump said while recapping war talks in Europe at the start of an unrelated White House event.\n\nTrump said he had a “long talk” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also spoke with the leaders of several European countries, including Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom as well as NATO.\n\n“Things are going along pretty well,” the president said.\n\nTrump said everyone wants to see the war end.\n\nPresident Trump to deliver remarks in North Carolina on Friday\n\nThe president’s upcoming trip to Rocky Mount was confirmed by Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley, a close Trump ally who was chair of the Republican National Committee during the 2024 election.\n\n“Let’s give him the North Carolina welcome he deserves,” Whatley wrote on social media. Whatley did not describe a reason for the trip in his social media post.\n\nThe event will take place at the Rocky Mount Events Center. Trump last week traveled to Pennsylvania to discuss the economy and cost of living.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson urges an appeal to ‘our better angels’ after weekend violence\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of tragedies,” the GOP speaker said as he arrived at the Capitol.\n\nHe drew on scripture to provide comfort to the Reiner family and others after “the senseless violence” this past weekend in Australia and at Brown University.\n\n“We have to appeal to our better angels,” Johnson said, and “I think we have to amplify those voices.”He declined to answer questions about Trump’s insensitive remarks after Reiner’s death.\n\nUS, Paraguay sign agreement setting out legal basis for American troops in the country\n\nThe United States and Paraguay have signed an agreement laying out the legal framework for American troops to be stationed the in the South American country and clearing the way for further defense and intelligence cooperation between the two as the Trump administration steps up military operations throughout the western hemisphere.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Ramirez signed the so-called “status of forces” agreement on Monday at the State Department. Both men hailed the deal as a step forward in relations that would enhance already strong counter-terrorism and -narcotics measures.\n\nSuch agreements outline the legal requirements and immunities for U.S. troops to be present in other countries, although there was no immediate announcement of any deployments to Paraguay.\n\nCalifornia hires two former CDC officials who rebuffed Trump, Kennedy\n\nCalifornia is hiring two former top federal health officials, state officials said Monday.\n\nSusan Monarez, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is helping California launch an effort to maintain trust in science-driven decision-making and improve public health infrastructure.\n\nMonarez is being joined by Dr. Debra Houry, CDC’s former chief medical officer. Both will be advisors, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.\n\nThe White House fired Monarez in August when she fell out of favor with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after only one month on the job. Houry and some other top CDC officials resigned in protest.\n\nA few Republicans speak out against Trump post on Reiner\n\nA few Republican members of Congress are calling out President Donald Trump’s insensitive social media post regarding the deaths of director-actor Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted ox X that regardless of how one felt about Reiner, “this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”\n\nRep. Mike Lawler of New York said of Trump’s post: “This statement is wrong. Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.”\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia tweeted: “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies. Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nNY Attorney General Letitia James makes first comments on the repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her\n\nJames said Monday she isn’t spending a lot of time thinking about the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her.\n\nJames, a Democrat, made her first public comments about the matter at an unrelated press conference after the news last week that a second federal grand jury had declined to indict her on charges related to her purchase of a home in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.\n\n“I don’t really spend a lot of time focused on this campaign of retribution,” said James. “I’ve got a lot of work on my hands — standing up and defending the rights of New Yorkers, protecting them from harms coming from Washington, D.C.”\n\nA judge last month threw out an indictment charging James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case at Republican President Donald Trump’s urging was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.\n\n“I’ve got a job to do,” said James, who had pleaded not guilty to the earlier indictment and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nPoll shows health costs are a rising concern among Americans\n\nAbout 3 in 10 Americans cite the cost of health care as the most urgent health problem facing the country, and about one-quarter say the health care system is in “crisis,” according to a new Gallup poll released Monday.\n\nThe poll also shows that only 16% of Americans are satisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S.\n\nThe findings from the survey conducted in November come as Congress has yet to address the spiking health insurance premium costs facing millions of Americans when Affordable Care Act health subsidies expire at the start of the new year.\n\nIt also comes as health expenses have risen across the board in response to a variety of factors, including inflation and the increasing use of expensive medications such as GLP-1 weight loss drugs.\n\nHunter Biden disbarred in Connecticut after complaints about federal convictions\n\nBiden agreed to the penalty and admitted to violating the state’s attorney conduct rules, but he did not admit to committing any crimes.\n\nHis father, former President Joe Biden, pardoned him last year after he was convicted of three felonies relating to a 2018 gun purchase and pleaded guilty to failing to pay federal taxes. He previously was disbarred in Washington, D.C.\n\nA Connecticut judge ordered the disbarment on Monday. Hunter Biden did not speak and he and his lawyer appeared via video at the virtual court hearing in Waterbury.\n\nThe judge found that Hunter Biden violated several lawyer ethics rules, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”\n\nIn a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment. He was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.\n\nWhite House views Russian openness to Ukraine joining the EU as a big deal\n\nThe U.S. officials who briefed reporters after Witkoff and Kushner met with Zelenskyy and other European officials in Berlin over the last two days said such an offer over Ukraine joining the EU would be a major concession by Moscow. But Russia has previously said it doesn’t object to Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has sued the BBC for defamation over a documentary that his lawyers say presents a \"false and defamatory\" portrayal of him.\n\nOn Monday night, Trump's lawyers filed a civil complaint in a federal court in Florida, seeking at least $5 billion in damages from the British broadcaster.\n\nThe 46-page lawsuit claims that the BBC has defamed Trump in a Panorama documentary that aired about a week before the 2024 election, called \"Trump: A Second Chance.\" The complaint alleges the program presented a \"false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of Trump.\n\nThe suit's allegations focus on how the documentary was edited, specifically regarding footage of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech near the White House.\n\n\"President Trump's powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing,\" a spokesperson for Trump's legal team told Business Insider.\n\nThe filing included correspondence that Trump and the BBC's legal team exchanged in November.\n\nTrump's attorney, Alejandro Brito, wrote a letter to the BBC on November 9, demanding that it retract \"false and defamatory statements\" about Trump. Brito threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion if it did not comply.\n\nThe BBC's legal team wrote back on November 13, saying that the BBC had \"no intention of misleading anyone\" and included a copy of the outlet's apology letter to Trump. The correspondence said that Trump did not have a basis for a defamation claim.\n\nIn a separate online statement on the same day, the BBC said the outlet and its chair, Samir Shah, were \"sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021.\"\n\n\"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms,\" the statement said. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"\n\nThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story; please check back for updates.",

    "fullText": "Kyle Joseph hopes his new relaxed approach in front of goal will give Hull City boss Sergej Jakirovic a headache going forward.\n\nThe 24-year-old former Blackpool man doubled his goal tally for the season in the space of four days with the opener in the 2-0 midweek win over Wrexham before two early goals in Saturday's 3-1 victory at Millwall - the team his dad supports.\n\nAfter ending a seven-match scoreless streak against Wrexham, Joseph told BBC Radio Humberside: \"The last couple of games I've probably stopped worrying.\n\n\"I can't control what people's opinions of me are, all I can control is what I can do on the pitch.\n\n\"Being in the moment and staying in the zone has really helped me, I want to continue with that, taking it a game at a time.\"\n\nThe six points have taken the Tigers back into the Championship play-off positions and Joseph said: \"It's a special win as [Millwall] have been flying.\n\n\"You can see the togetherness of the squad. It's a special group. Everyone is buying into it, pulling in the same direction, from top to bottom.\n\n\"It's so important to have than unity and togetherness. There's a really good feeling in the camp.\"\n\nJoseph said a conversation with team-mate Oli McBurnie the day before the Millwall game had helped him.\n\n\"To have a player like Oli to learn off, there's so much I can squeeze out of him,\" he said.\n\n\"He's played La Liga, Championship and Premier League, he's been down there in the lower leagues too. He gives me ideas and solutions, I find that invaluable and it helps my game so much. He's an unbelievable player and human being.\"\n\nWith McBurnie scoring in his two appearances off the bench after injury, Jakirovic has a dilemma up front, and Joseph added: \"All I can do is try to be in the manager's mind.\n\n\"I'll never kick my toys out of the pram for not being in the team, I want to play but if I don't, I don't sulk, I am a good teammate on the bench.\n\n\"I want to give the manager a headache and show I am ready to play.\"",

    "description": "BBC Scotland previews the Scottish League Cup final between St Mirren and Celtic.",
    "fullText": "Premier Sports Cup final: St Mirren v Celtic\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Sunday, 14 December Kick-off: 15:30 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds & digital\n\nIt's a game which means so much to so many, and for so many reasons.\n\nFor St Mirren, the objective is a straightforward one. Win the Scottish League Cup for only the second time in the club's history. Be heroes. Legends. Deities of Paisley who will never have to buy a beer again.\n\nIn the other half, it's about another trophy to add to the cabinet. But, it's also about arresting a run of two straight defeats for new Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy with the deafening din of fan unrest bellowing towards the club's board.\n\nWhatever happens at Hampden on Sunday, it promises to be a defining day for both sides.\n\nSt Mirren arrive at the national stadium with nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\nAny team who faces either half of the Old Firm in a cup final will know they are up against a huge task. Vastly higher amounts of resources, money, fans and quality set the bar high.\n\nYet, Stephen Robinson's team will emerge from the Hampden tunnel on Sunday with a steely-eyed determination and a swagger of self belief.\n\nIt's founded on both their own ethos and also the fortunes of their opponents.\n\nSt Mirren faced in-form Motherwell in last month's semi-final, a game many tipped the Lanarkshire team to win given their heralded brand of intricate football. Instead, they were outfought, out-thought and outplayed by Saints on the way to a deserved 4-1 victory.\n\nIt was a tactical lesson from Robinson who masterminded the perfect game plan to nullify his old club.\n\nDuring his time at Fir Park, he guided them to a final at Hampden twice in the one season. On both occasions, they came up short against Celtic.\n\nThis time, he'll surely feel that it can be third-time lucky.\n\nSt Mirren and Celtic have played each other twice on league duty this season, and Saints have been desperately unlucky to lose both by a late goal.\n\nThe cause for concern for the 13,000 or so Saints fans going to Hampden will come from their form since beating Motherwell in that semi-final.\n\nFive games have been and gone with just one win, albeit that came in their last game with a 2-0 victory over Dundee United.\n\nSt Mirren sit ninth in the league - although with two games in hand over some of their rivals - but Robinson is famous for his team being well drilled and hard to play against.\n\nThey are tags which Saints took umbrage with in the wake of that Hampden win last month. While many presumed they would just try to stifle Motherwell, the Paisley side were ruthless, clinical, and played with a desire which blew away Jens Berthel Askou's team.\n\n'Old ladies were hanging out windows' - remembering St Mirren's 2013 League Cup win\n\nSt Mirren's journey to Hampden began all the way back in July, in the group stages. After a goalless draw in their opener against Arbroath, who snatched the bonus point with a shootout victory, the Buddies beat Forfar 2-1 then skelped Annan 8-2, helped by a hat-trick from Mikael Mandron.\n\nA 2-1 closing victory over Ayr, thanks to Killian Phillips' double, earned top spot with 10 points from 12.\n\nSecond round: St Mirren 1-1 Hearts (5-4 on pens)\n\nThe Paisley side had their work cut out against high-flying Premiership leaders Hearts in round two.\n\nAlex Gogic put Saints ahead before half-time, only for Oisin McEntee to level with just over 10 minutes to play. The tie went the distance and Shamal George's save from Claudio Braga's penalty in the shootout proved decisive as the Buddies squeezed through.\n\nQuarter-final: Kilmarnock 2-2 St Mirren (3-5 on pens)\n\nYet again St Mirren had to progress on spot-kicks. Mandron and Jayden Richardson struck either side of Robbie Deas' equaliser but a late penalty from Bruce Anderson took the tie to a shootout.\n\nMalik Dijksteel capitalised on Kyle Magennis' miss for the hosts to set up a semi-final against Motherwell.\n\nSemi-final: Motherwell 1-4 St Mirren\n\nThe Buddies had no reason to fear as they cruised past Jens Berthel Askou's highly-praised Steelmen and were two to the good at half-time thanks to Mandron and Dan Nlundulu.\n\nCallum Hendry pulled one back late on but it wasn't enough to mount a comeback as Robinson's side found another two goals courtesy of Richard King and Mandron.\n\nNancy's introduction to life in Glasgow as Celtic manager has been a challenging one, to say the least.\n\nThe former Columbus Crew head coach has two games and two defeats under his belt in what is a pivotal week for the defending Scottish champions.\n\nFollowing the sudden resignation of Brendan Rodgers, Martin O'Neill was sworn in to take temporary charge.\n\nAmid amusing anecdotes in press conferences, leaping about on the touchline and chat about stealing tracksuits as a souvenir of his second spell at Parkhead, a ship that was heading for trouble was steadied.\n\nRangers were defeated in the League Cup semi-final, a heroic showing in Rotterdam stunned Feyenoord, and the gap to league leaders Hearts was narrowed to three points before their visit to Glasgow last Sunday.\n\nIt proved to be Nancy's first game, and one in which the Edinburgh club surged to a 2-1 victory as howls of ire around Celtic Park were swapped for swathes of empty seats before full-time.\n\nNext was Thursday's 3-0 Europa League loss to Roma, with the margin of defeat not reflective of the large gulf between the two teams on the night.\n\nDiscussion of whether Nancy should have been excused from taking charge across this hat-trick of games before beginning his era has raged across the air waves, column inches and social media pages.\n\nFan dissatisfaction at the club's board also doesn't help the backdrop to this one.\n\nAlready there is pressure on Nancy, there always is in this part of town. But what has gone in the last week, and even before he even set foot in Glasgow, has raised the tension level.\n\nWinning the club's 23rd League Cup will not cure Celtic of all its problems. Months of supporter frustration at league placing, a failed transfer window and a botched attempt at Champions League progression will take some undoing.\n\nHowever, victory over St Mirren would provide a firm foothold for the Frenchman to dig into. It's the chance for a first win on the board, an incredibly early shot at a first trophy at the club, and a platform on which to stabilise and build.\n\nIf they don't win, the level of fury from fans could be off the scale.\n\n'Nancy exposed to brutal life as Celtic manager as cup final looms'\n\nCup final victory would 'validate' Celtic process - Nancy\n\nSecond round: Celtic 4-1 Falkirk\n\nCeltic kicked off their trophy defence under Brendan Rodgers back in August, beating Falkirk 4-1 at home with Daizen Maeda, Alistair Johnston and Dane Murray on target along with a Liam Henderson own goal.\n\nQuarter-final: Partick Thistle 0-4 Celtic\n\nThey followed that up by swatting aside Partick Thistle 4-0 in the quarter-final at Firhill. Sebastian Tounekti scored his first goal for the club and Yang Hyun-jun, Liam Scales and substitute Luke McCowan also netted.\n\nSemi-final: Celtic 3-1 Rangers AET\n\nQuestions were raised about the 73-year-old's return but O'Neill kept the momentum going as Celtic sailed to a 3-1 win after extra time over their fierce rivals.\n\nGoals from Jonny Kenny, captain Callum McGregor and Callum Osmand secured their passage to the final.\n\nSt Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: \"There will be a nervous energy, of course. We aren't Celtic who get to every cup final or every other cup final.\n\n\"So we have to embrace the day and enjoy the day but most of all what I coin it with is have faith over fear. Really believe in the system, in each other, in the staff, and the stuff we've put on in preparation.\n\n\"We see all the photographs of the teams that have been very, very successful here and won trophies and they're held in such high regard. What I try and do is to tell the players 'We want your names there, we want your pictures there'.\n\n\"They've got their pictures up for the European achievements, for the top-six achievements, now we want them up [for winning the cup]. We want them to be remembered, we want them to be recognised everywhere they go for the rest of their life.\"\n\nSt Mirren defender Marcus Fraser: \"In 10, 20 years, people will probably still be talking about it [a win] and you can obviously write your own chapter in the club's history.\n\n\"So I think that's one of the key aspects that we want to do, really grab the opportunity with two hands and if we can get up on that wall, then in a few years' time, when you walk by it, that would be a great feeling.\"\n\nCeltic manager Wilfried Nancy: \"Yes, I would like to win the trophy. I'm pretty sure that, if we don't win it, it's going to be difficult, because when we lose, this is painful.\n\n\"But, again, I am optimistic as a person. So hopefully we're going to do it. And also if it's going to validate what we are doing. But, if not, I don't want to think about this because, for the moment, I want to stay positive and this is the way I think.\n\n\"I'm going to have many, many other times to show, to do my stuff and to convince the fans that I am the right guy.\"\n\nCeltic midfielder Luke McCowan: \"We're disappointed as a team with the last two results and we need to get on top of it.\n\n\"We have to [stick by Nancy], there's no way around it. He's the manager, he's got his staff with him, we're players at this club. He's the one that's going to lead us into victories with whatever style and whatever management the way he wants.\n\n\"Once it clicks then we're hopefully thinking that's going to propel us into the performances we need and winning games most importantly.\"",

    "fullText": "Mid-table Brentford face a resurgent Leeds side, who have won four points in their past two matches against Chelsea and Liverpool. BBC Sport looks at some of the key themes ahead of Sunday's match.\n\nBrentford have won just one of their four Premier League games against Leeds and will be looking to avoid three straight defeats in the Premier League for the first time since February 2024, after losses to Arsenal and Tottenham.\n\nIt was more away day pain for Keith Andrews' side last week in north London as they gave a toothless display at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The Bees had just four shots in the match, with one on target and a measly xG of 0.29.\n\nWhile their mid-table figure of 21 Premier League goals for the season doesn't ring immediate alarm bells, the spread of those goals may be a cause of concern. Striker Igor Thiago has scored over half - and five of his 11 have been from the penalty spot.\n\nRecord signing Dango Ouattara has won four of those penalties, more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues. This game will be Ouattara's last appearance before leaving to represent Burkina Faso at the Africa Cup of Nations. Brentford will need the likes of Mikel Damsgaard and Kevin Schade to fill this creative void. As it stands, veteran midfielder Jordan Henderson leads the way at the club for Premier League assists, with three.\n\nLeeds had lost four straight Premier League games going into their midweek fixture against Chelsea last week, using a 4-3-3 formation. But for the second half against Manchester City in the final fixture of those four defeats, Farke deviated from his usual four at the back to try a 3-5-2.\n\nDespite being pipped 3-2 by Pep Guardiola's side, the performance was encouraging and Farke has since started his side in a 3-5-2 in subsequent fixtures against Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nThe results have been stark, with four points from two matches against established heavyweight sides and three goals scored in each. It is as many times as Leeds had scored three in the Premier League across their previous 37 games.\n\nBrentford have had mixed fortunes facing the formation. They have won just twice in the seven games they have played in the Premier League against sides using a 3-5-2.",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace can move to within two points of Manchester City when the sides meet this weekend. BBC Sport examines some of the key themes before Sunday's match.\n\nPalace have never beaten Pep Guardiola's City at Selhurst Park but they did come out on top in last season's FA Cup final, claiming their first major trophy courtesy of a 1-0 win.\n\nThe Eagles only had 22% possession in the final but were able to stifle City's attack while remaining a threat on the counter. That's been a strategy regularly employed by boss Oliver Glasner – 17 of Palace's last 20 league wins have come in matches where they have had under 50% possession.\n\nThe Londoners, who claimed a comfortable Conference League win at Shelbourne on Thursday, have started the season impressively. They already have 26 points, which is twice as many as at this stage last year and their highest figure after 15 Premier League games.\n\nHowever, the festive period could prove a testing one for Palace's relatively shallow squad. Ismaila Sarr, their second highest scorer this term, is expected to report for Africa Cup of Nations duty with Senegal next week, providing he overcomes a recent injury.\n\nTo make matters worse, wing-back Daniel Munoz, who was outstanding against City at Wembley, will be out for at least four weeks following knee surgery.\n\nCity win again but Guardiola demands more\n\nManchester City made it four wins in a row – and eight victories from their past 10 games – by beating Real Madrid on Wednesday, but Guardiola was quick to bring his side back down to earth.\n\nHe insisted City have produced better performances at the Bernabeu without winning, adding \"that level is not quite enough\" for success in the latter stages of the Champions League.\n\nThe Spaniard was also the party pooper after last weekend's 3-0 victory over Sunderland. Summer signing Rayan Cherki starred in that game, assisting two goals, but Guardiola appeared unimpressed by the Frenchman's rabona cross for City's third.\n\n\"I want players to do the simple things well,\" the manager said afterwards, pointedly noting he has never seen Lionel Messi attempt a rabona.\n\nGuardiola is hardly known for simplicity in team selection, with his penchant for rotation – and so-called 'Pep Roulette' – a familiar frustration for fantasy football managers.\n\nYet this season, the 54-year-old has relied on continuity more than in the past. Wednesday's win in Madrid was the fifth time he has named an unchanged starting line-up in the current campaign. Before 2025-26, he had never done so more than twice in a season with City.",

Then, they were a division apart but this weekend, only a point separates the teams.\n\nSunderland may have had the upper hand in the derbies before the clubs' respective relegations, but I welcome the return of the fixture.\n\nUnlike in the 2010s - when both were either in mid-table or fighting relegation - this weekend's match will be contested by two good teams, representing ambitious clubs.\n\nEddie Howe said his first words to the players about the derby were delivered in the dressing room after the draw with Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday. That is because Newcastle's focus has been on their Champions League campaign while also trying to improve their Premier League position, which they have managed to do since the November international break.\n\nHowe would have liked a full week to prepare but the Magpies are now so used to playing every three or four days that a lack of training time should not be a problem.\n\nTheir record under Howe in the biggest matches is very good and he has top-level players who will love an occasion like this.\n\nI sense uncertainty among the fanbase about how Sunday will go. Many consider Sunderland favourites after their impressive return to the Premier League. Newcastle's bad habit of throwing away a lead and conceding late goals - sometimes doing both in the same game - adds to the unease.\n\nBut, I think the extra quality of the away side will make the difference and ensure three points go back to Tyneside.\n\nExplore Newcastle content on BBC Sounds",

Again, we need to evolve our things that can counter what the opponent is doing.\n\n\"The basics and the foundations of how we do things are at a good level. Now, we need little tweaks - when we attack, how we can be more balanced in defence, attacking the box, how we can find this final pass.\n\n\"The basics are there, the foundations are there, the principles are there.\"\n\nTonight, St Johnstone take on fourth-placed Ayr United at Somerset Park. Currently 11 points behind the leaders, Scott Brown's side surely need a victory if they are to keep any title ambitions alive.\n\nWhile St Johnstone's midweek KDM Evolution match with Hearts B was postponed due to high winds in Edinburgh, Ayr's match with Peterhead went ahead, with the Honest Men winning 2-1.\n\nThe good news for Ayr was a first goal of the season for striker Anton Dowds, who missed a year of football after suffering an ACL injury. The 29-year-old only returned to match action in September.\n\nBefore his injury last season, Dowds was one of the hottest strikers in the Championship and Brown will clearly be hoping he can return to that kind of form from now until the end of the season.\n\nThistle will be watching proceedings this evening with interest. Any slip up from Saints gives them the chance to grab top spot on Saturday.\n\nHowever, that will be far from simple for the Jags as they travel north to take on third-top Arbroath.",

Over many years he has rightly become an Anfield legend and, if he leaves in the next transfer window, let's hope for all concerned that this spat can be washed away and fans can remember the fantastic memories he gave them.",

    "fullText": "Authorities in Switzerland have arrested the husband of a former finalist for Miss Switzerland, alleging that he strangled her to death before dismembering her and blending her body parts.\n\nKristina Joksimovic was killed during the February of 2024, according to the BBC.\n\nPolice referred to the 38-year-old beauty queen by her initials in court documents, which further noted she was a finalist in the Miss Switzerland competition back in 2007. Swiss media has identified the husband — who is not named in the docs — as Thomas. Investigators, however, did reveal that the suspect is a 43-year-old male.\n\nThomas has been formally charged with his wife's murder as well as disturbing the peace, prosecutors announced on Thursday, December 10.\n\nThomas had previously told investigators that when he returned to their Binningen home the night of the murder, he found Joksimovic already dead. But less than a month later, the husband was changing his tune, according to police. He allegedly later told detectives he had actually killed his wife in an act of self-defense.\n\nBut forensic experts later determined Joksimovic had been beheaded Joksimovic prior to her death, and that her remains showed no signs of a struggle, contradicting her husband's account of the events.\n\nDetectives started investigating Joksimovic's death almost immediately after it happened, noting its suspicious nature, but her husband was not officially charged with the beauty queen's murder until this month, according to prosecutors.\n\nThrough an autopsy, medical examiners were able to determine the husband allegedly dismembered Joksimovic using a jigsaw and garden shears.\n\nThe reports further claim police said that the victim's womb had been \"carefully removed\" by Thomas as part of a \"deliberate mutilation or ritualized degradation of the body.\"\n\nThe husband allegedly proceeded to slice up her body parts and then used an industrial grade blender to liquefy her remains.\n\nLindsay Shiver Set to Be Released on Bail After Allegedly Plotting to Kill Estranged Husband\n\nLocal reports described the body as having been \"puréed.\" The husband also allegedly added a chemical dissolvent to help break down his wife's body.\n\nAs he cut up her remains, the husband allegedly watched videos on YouTube.\n\nJoksimovic and Thomas have two young children together.\n\nUs Weekly was unable to determine if the husband has been asked to enter pleas to the two charges filed against him. It was also unclear if he had hired an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\n\nLocal media is reporting Joksimovic's own father found her remains, after noticing strands of blonde hair sticking out of a black bag.\n\nThe husband will remain in custody until his next court date, which has not been set yet.\n\nAccording to her Instagram profile, Joksimovic primarily worked as a modeling coach. Her page features instructional videos on mastering the catwalk as well as footage of her working with her clients on their walks.\n\nIf you or someone you love is experiencing domestic violence, you are encouraged to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at (800) 799-7233 or visit thehotline.org.

    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah's incendiary interview attacking Liverpool head coach Arne Slot and the club after he was left out of the draw at Leeds United contained one memorable soundbite that stuck out above many others.\n\nIt was the 33-year-old's claim he had been \"thrown under the bus\" after a glittering Liverpool career encompassing all major prizes and 250 goals that put him third on their all-time list of scorers.\n\nSalah's outburst came after he was left on the bench for a third successive Premier League game as Slot tried to end a sequence of nine defeats in 12 games.\n\nThe Egyptian did not disguise his belief he had been made a scapegoat, provoking divisive debate when Slot and Liverpool needed unity and calm – but was his claim justified?\n\nSalah says he has been 'thrown under the bus' by Liverpool\n\n'A clear challenge to Slot's authority in Salah's show of rebellion'\n\nSalah has the selfish streak and pride that is the preserve of all the greats – as was seen when then Manchester United manager Erik ten Haag, a Dutch countryman of Slot, dropped Cristiano Ronaldo at the end of his second spell at Old Trafford in November 2022.\n\nRonaldo's response was to give an interview to Piers Morgan on TalkTV in which he complained, as Salah has effectively done now, that he was \"betrayed by the club\".\n\nManchester United and Ronaldo agreed, within days, to cancel his contract.\n\nSalah's contract will not be cancelled.\n\nLiverpool would, if they sold, demand a sizeable fee for a global figure who signed a new two-year contract in May, but such is the Egyptian's strength of feeling, reconciliation looks difficult.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Salah will even get the farewell he hinted at when Liverpool play Brighton on Saturday before he heads off to the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nSo does the evidence support Salah's assertion that \"it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame\" and that \"someone doesn't want me in the club\"?\n\nSalah has been a shadow of his old self this season. For the first time, someone who looked at the peak of his physical and footballing powers last season has started to look his age.\n\nThe contrast in numbers is stark and unflattering.\n\nHe was the inspiration as Liverpool won a 20th title last season, scoring 34 goals in 50 starts in all competitions. This term he has made 16 starts, scoring only five times.\n\nSalah's ability to do defensive dirty work was also called into question, with Chelsea's Marc Cucurella suggesting they targeted Liverpool's right flank in their 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in October because he was \"always ready to attack\".\n\nNot a problem when Salah is providing a regular supply of goals, but brought into sharp relief when they dry up.\n\nSalah, however, feels he is right to flag up he has hardly been Liverpool's only problem this season.\n\nHe, more than anyone, has missed Trent Alexander-Arnold after his move to Real Madrid, the pair forming a magnificent partnership as Liverpool claimed major honours, including two Premier Leagues and the Champions League.\n\nAlexander-Arnold played 147 line-breaking passes for Salah when the title was won last season, the most any player provided for a team-mate in the Premier League.\n\nFormer Liverpool and England defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport: \"Trent leaving has had an impact on Salah. Their partnership, if not exactly unnoticed, was almost taken as read. They are world class individuals, but it was also a partnership.\n\n\"They really complemented each other. Trent could go inside, draw people towards him, which freed up more space for Salah. And when Salah drove at people he had the ability to feed Trent because teams were backing off.\"\n\nSalah can also point elsewhere in Liverpool's team and wonder why others have not received the same treatment.\n\nIbrahima Konate's poor form is irrelevant as he is a central defender and Liverpool lack cover, but Cody Gakpo's contribution on the left flank has been fleeting this season, the Netherlands international too predictable.\n\nFlorian Wirtz has offered little since his £116m move from Bayer Leverkusen while Alexander Isak, a British record signing at £125m from Newcastle United, has scored one Premier League goal.\n\nAnd yet it is Salah who has been sacrificed.\n\nSalah did not name names, but it is understandable a world class player and one of Liverpool's all-time greats would feel he has been singled out\n\nThe argument has merit. Its expression did not.\n\nLiverpool's head coach – whoever it was – would eventually have to handle a transition that would conclude Salah's Anfield career. This task has fallen to Slot.\n\nThe fact it comes so quickly after Salah won last season's Professional Footballers' Association player of the year, the Football Writers' Association Footballer Of The Year, as well as Premier League player of the year and the Golden Boot, makes it even more contentious.\n\nNo player has limitless credit – think Steven Gerrard being nudged towards Anfield's door by Brendan Rodgers in 2015.\n\nDoing nothing was not an option. Dropping Salah was a pragmatic choice to stop Liverpool being so vulnerable and more defensively solid. The champions have conceded 24 goals in 15 league games compared to 41 all last season.\n\nSlot also spent £450m in the summer, the clearest signal Liverpool were moving into a new era.\n\nIn public, Slot has been nothing but respectful to Salah, although the player is convinced their relationship is now broken.\n\nSlot said after Salah was dropped to the bench for the win at West Ham United, the first time in a Premier League game since April 2024: \"No matter if he plays well or if he doesn't play well, if he plays or doesn't play, he will always be that top professional and that's what he was in the last two days.\"\n\nIt should also be noted that Salah had only been on the bench for three games in six days before making a rare, but as always carefully calculated, stop to speak to reporters at Elland Road.\n\nSlot also had to plan for the short and long term, with Salah leaving for Afcon after the Brighton game.\n\nThe Dutchman must deal in reality not sentiment. He needed results quickly and Salah's numbers have not read well.\n\nSalah's legs have not carried the pace of old. His dribble success is down to 23% this season compared to 56% in his first season. Can he still go past players?\n\nSlot places great store in winning duels – and Salah's rate is down to 28% from 38.7% in his first season.\n\nSalah's exclusion has, to an extent, worked, with Liverpool winning twice and drawing twice in his absence, including the vital Champions League win against Inter Milan in the San Siro.\n\nSlot's selection at West Ham provided a clear signpost to life without Salah, as the all-round strength of Dominik Szoboszlai was deployed in his right flank role with Wirtz dropping behind a striker to pull the strings.\n\nHe then used a diamond midfield in Milan, with Wirtz on the bench and Isak and Hugo Ekitike as twin strikers.\n\nThis means Slot can point to the fact Liverpool have not lost since Salah was dropped.\n\nThe argument, however, will rage on.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "England being two-nil down after two Tests of an Ashes series has few positives, other than a) increasing the likelihood of a stage musical about the series being written if a stirring comeback leads to a historic 3-2 victory; and b) familiarity.\n\nThis the eighth time in the past 10 Ashes tours of Australia that England have lost the first two Tests, and the 12th time in the past 20 Ashes contests in either hemisphere - a sequence that began in 1989 when England attempted to fight fire with selectorial mayhem, making four changes after each of the first four Tests, then treating themselves to six changes for the sixth and final match.\n\nSince the Second World War, England lead the 'Losing the First Two Tests of an Ashes Series' competition by an impressive margin of 17 to 2, with Australia's only experience of what has become the default state of Ashesness for England coming in 2013 and 1978-79 (when almost all of Australia's first and second-choice players were playing World Series Cricket rather than the Ashes).\n\nWhile the fading echo of the first day in Perth, the various acts of miraculous fortune-flipping in captain Ben Stokes' career, Joe Root having finally added his name to an Australian honours board, and the theoretical brilliance of England's batting line-up offer morsels of optimism if you squint hard enough, Ashes history offers little statistical succour.\n\nIn 16 of those 18 previous post-war Ashes rubbers in which a team has trailed 2-0 after two Tests, that side has lost the series by at least three Tests. In 1994-95, England micro-bucked the trend by losing only 3-1.\n\nThe glaring exception to the hefty thrashing rule was England in the 2023 series, so England's entire top six has recent experience of coming close to being the first side without Australia legend Don Bradman in it to fight back from two matches down to win an Ashes series.",

    "fullText": "Six contenders have been shortlisted for the award, which will be presented during the live show on BBC One on Thursday, 18 December.\n\nThe 2024 World Sport Star award was won by Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis.\n\nBelow you can vote for your favourite - and find out more about the contenders.\n\nSpain midfielder Caldentey enjoyed a stellar first season in English football, with her performances instrumental in Arsenal's march to Champions League glory, beating her former club Barcelona in the final.\n\nAfter scoring 19 goals in 41 appearances for the Gunners in her first season, Caldentey was named the Professional Footballers' Association women's player of the year and the Women's Super League player of the year.\n\nCaldentey scored in the Women's Euro 2025 final, which Spain narrowly lost to England on penalties.\n\nThe 29-year-old was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or award, missing out to compatriot Aitana Bonmati, and was also included in Uefa's Champions League team of the year.\n\nThe making of Spain and Arsenal's humble magician\n\nArsenal's Caldentey wins WSL player of year award\n\nSport: Boxing Country: United States\n\nCrawford cemented his status as one of the greatest boxers in history by becoming the first male fighter to be undisputed champion across three weight divisions in the four-belt era.\n\nThe 38-year-old had to go up two weight classes to face the great Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez at super-middleweight, but secured a unanimous decision in front of a fiercely pro-Mexican crowd in Las Vegas.\n\nIn claiming the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO and The Ring belts, the American extended his professional record to 42 straight victories - the past 20 of which have been world title fights.\n\nHowever, Crawford was stripped of the WBC belt earlier in December, with president Mauricio Sulaiman claiming the American did not pay sanctioning fees.\n\n'Crawford conquers Canelo to become the face of boxing'\n\nHistory-maker Crawford stuns Canelo in Vegas\n\nSport: Athletics Country: Sweden\n\nIn 2025, Sweden's Duplantis once again soared above his rivals to capture a third pole vault World Championship gold.\n\nIn doing so, he set yet another world record of 6.30m - his fourth of this year alone - and the 14th of his remarkable career.\n\nHe also retained his indoor world title - meaning he has won eight successive golds in major global competitions - and won all 16 of his events to become the first male pole vaulter in modern history to go undefeated for two successive years.\n\nIn November, the 26-year-old was named men's world athlete of the year for a third time.\n\nDuplantis gets 14th world record & third world title\n\nThe making of Mondo: How Duplantis is reaching new heights\n\nSport: Athletics Country: United States\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone, the greatest female 400m hurdler of all time, made the switch to the 400m flat at the World Athletics Championships this year, but the result remained the same as she became the first athlete to claim career world titles in both disciplines.\n\nHer time of 47.78 seconds was the second fastest in history and she came close to breaking a world record that has stood since 1985.\n\nThe 26-year-old is undefeated across both distances for two years.\n\nShe added another gold in the 4x400m relay in Tokyo and was named the women's world athlete of the year.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone wins 400m gold with second fastest time in history\n\nDuplantis & McLaughlin-Levrone named world athletes of year\n\nOn the LA Dodgers' march towards retaining their World Series title, Japanese superstar Ohtani produced one of the greatest individual performances in Major League Baseball history.\n\nThe rare 'two-way' player, who operates as both a pitcher and a hitter, smashed three home runs and struck out 10 batters against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThat made him the first pitcher since 1942 to hit three home runs in the same game.\n\nThe 31-year-old was named as one of baseball's Most Valuable Players for the third straight year, and the fourth time overall, moving him into second on the all-time list.\n\nOhtani wins fourth Major League MVP award\n\nOhtani rewrites history to send Dodgers to World Series\n\nSalah, the 'Egyptian King', scored 29 Premier League goals and broke a host of records as he helped Liverpool to a record-equalling 20th top-flight title in the 2024-25 season.\n\nHe became the first player to win the Golden Boot, the Playmaker award for most assists and the Premier League player of the season award in the same campaign. He was also named as the PFA men's player of the year for a record third time and collected a third Football Writers' footballer of the year award.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the highest-scoring overseas player in Premier League history, overtaking Sergio Aguero's mark of 184.\n\nSalah has scored five goals in 18 appearances for Liverpool so far this season, and on Saturday said he felt like he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and that his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.\n\n'The hunger makes me want more' - Salah wins third PFA award",
