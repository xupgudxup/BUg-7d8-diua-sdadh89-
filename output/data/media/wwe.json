    "fullText": "The Last Time Is Now. It's the name given to the tournament in which 16 wrestling giants have been competing to be the one opponent in John Cena's final fight before retirement.\n\nAnd that final fight is now - Saturday night - in Washington DC, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career that has seen the American become one of wrestling's biggest and most bankable stars.\n\nIn the 8,570 days since his debut, Cena has clinched 17 world titles and coined the iconic \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase - but the 48-year-old's impact goes far beyond that.\n\nIf you were to pose the question \"who is John Cena?\", depending on who you ask, the answers might vary from legendary WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) superstar, to successful film actor, while some will say he's Mr Make-A-Wish (more on that later).\n\nHow to watch John Cena's last match:\n\nStart time: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event is scheduled to begin at 01:00 GMT on Sun 14 Dec\n\nWhere to watch: In the UK, you can watch for free on WWE's official YouTube channel. Internationally it can be watched on Netflix, and on Peacock in the US\n\nSince his 2002 debut, there's been an evolution in his own wrestling character - transitioning from \"ruthless aggression\" rookie, to a \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" rapper, and eventually a heroic character known for a \"Never Give Up\" attitude.\n\nDespite criticism from some fans of his in-ring ability, with occasional chants of \"you can't wrestle\" through the years, \"there's no doubt that he's an exceptional wrestling talent\", says Brandon Thurston, editor and owner of wrestling website, Wrestlenomics.\n\nHe feels something changed in 2005, after which WWE became \"increasingly scripted in a way it had not been\" before, as it entered into a more controlled, family friendly PG era. But Cena managed thrive.\n\n\"He's definitely been the biggest draw over the time which I would say stretches from 2005 to roughly 2015,\" Mr Thurston says, with Cena's merchandise also regularly topping sales for the company.\n\n\"There's little question that he was WWE's most important economic wrestler throughout that time - in terms of pay-per-view buys, which were still central in that era, TV ratings, and as a house show draw.\"\n\nOutside the ring too, he's a personality who \"people gravitate towards and want to listen to\", says Mr Thurston - and wrestling fans like Joe Clarkson and Sabrina Nicole feel just that.\n\n\"To go for such a long time in an industry, which is quite heavily taxing on the body, is absolutely fascinating,\" says Joe, 24, who was five when he first saw Cena on TV.\n\n\"I think over time, the people just gained more and more respect for him, not just as a performer, but also as an individual.\"\n\nFor Sabrina, 37, who remembers Cena's WWE debut in 2002, it's \"his charisma\".\n\n\"He has just always had something about him that makes him a star,\" she says, adding that for most of his career, he's \"always maintained a good guy persona\".\n\n\"No matter what the crowd, no matter what the fans have thought of him. He has just been the testament to if you have a really good character, you can be on top,\" she says.\n\nIt also seems to be true that, beyond his ability and persona, Cena seized an opportunity.\n\nWith The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin no longer full-time performers, WWE bosses were looking for a new star to emerge.\n\nBrandon feels WWE leadership recognised Cena \"would be a very reliable and extremely hardworking person whom they could entrust with such a spot\".\n\nIt's widely accepted within wrestling circles that the final decision to have Cena as the chosen star would ultimately have been taken by then-WWE chairman Vince McMahon.\n\nWhile he was known for following his instincts, there will also have been a judgement on Cena's ability to connect with a passionate crowd on the mic, his marketability and whether he could be in the industry long enough to be profitable.\n\nAnd when Cena started taking more time away from wrestling in 2015 and working a reduced schedule, Mr Thurston feels there was a \"decline\" in the WWE product.\n\nOther wrestling experts have suggested Cena's presence over the years helped slow the slide of WWE ratings trending downwards which, according to analysis by wrestling site PWtorch, saw average viewership for its flagship weekly Raw programme fall by a million between 2010 and 2015, to 3.7m.\n\nHaving achieved so much within wrestling, Cena could \"just come in and be a wrestler and walk out\", adds Dr Gillian Brooks, associate professor in marketing at King's Business School, but instead she says he built a personal brand that comes across as real.\n\nAmong the brands Cena has worked with is Neutrogena, becoming the face of its sunscreen campaign after revealing he had skin cancer spots - which he attributed to his own lack of sun protection use.\n\nHe also holds the Guinness World Record for the number of wishes granted through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with more than 650 fulfilled wishes for children with critical illnesses. It's a partnership he revealed had started by \"accident\", but one he's kept since 2002, describing it as \"the coolest thing\".\n\n\"If you think about it from a child's perspective, they're seeing someone that they've seen on TV watching WWE or in films, and they suddenly get to meet him,\" Dr Brooks says. \"The fact that he's doing charity work, he's written a children's book, been in films, made music… all these things illustrate that he's not a one show pony.\n\n\"It's coming across in a way that's very authentic and very sort of pure to who he is.\"\n\nBoth Cena's personal brand and his charisma are set to live on, but his time in the ring looks to have come to an end after Cena announced last year that 2025 would be his last as a competitor.\n\nExplaining his reasoning at the time, he told of the physical toll wrestling had taken on his body.\n\nHis career has seen him undergo several operations, including on his neck, pec and triceps, with Cena saying in interviews that his \"body hurts\" and is \"screaming to close the chapter\".\n\nWhile the old saying \"never say never\" is a popular one, Cena has repeatedly said he will be \"100% done\" - and has received rousing receptions around the world for his final appearances.\n\nOverall, fan Joe is happy with Cena's \"retirement run\", with matches against old rivals such as AJ Styles, Randy Orton and CM Punk, and newer stars including Dominik Mysterio and Gunther.\n\nHe does feel the \"execution\" of his final year could have been better though, with Cena's short-term \"heel turn\" (becoming a villain) at the Elimination Chamber event in March drawing criticism.\n\n\"It could have been handled better,\" Joe says. \"[But] he's had such a unique distinction of having a retirement run that no one's ever had before.\n\n\"It's very sad to see him retire now. But I think he said it himself - it's the right time.\"\n\nNot that WWE fans will never see Cena again; he has signed a five-year deal to be an ambassador for the company.\n\nHaving won The Last Time Is Now tournament, it's former world heavyweight champion Gunther who will face Cena in his final fight.\n\nWith it not being broadcast on terrestrial TV, but rather on streaming platforms, it's been reported that there is no time limit on the match - and Gunther, who has never wrestled Cena before, has been giving much tough talk.\n\nOne thing's for sure: \"You Can't See Me\" might be the taunt Cena gives Gunther, but the last fight will be seen and remembered by many.\n\nGrand Theft Auto made him a legend. His latest game was a disaster\n\nSo bad they're good - why do we love terrible films?\n\nWhy Indiana Jones, Barbie and other US films were shot in UK",

    "title": "The 3 faces of John Cena: How WWE's franchise player became bigger than wrestling",
    "description": "When looking at John Cena’s legacy, it boils down to a trio of personas that embodied the superstar who defined a generation.",
    "fullText": "How do you effectively sum up the career of a legend?\n\nHow do you take a quarter-century worth of accomplishments, championships and memories and boil them down into something easily digestible, yet appropriately meaningful at the same time?\n\nHow do you quantify a once-in-a-generation run in a realm that doesn’t track bumps taken, finishers hit or smiles delivered?\n\nIn an industry as unquantifiable as professional wrestling, you swerve everyone, and look at the numbers.\n\nThere’s the biggest one, 17, representing the record number of world championships won. There’s 26, the number of years wrestled when all is said and done. There’s 1,554, the tally of matches to this point in the career. There’s 100, the number of victories at premium live events — when the lights are brightest.\n\nAll of those are great, but they fail to encapsulate John Cena, who, on Saturday, will wrestle for the final time in a WWE ring. For Cena, the number that should exemplify his legacy is three.\n\nThere’s an intended irony in describing a retiring pro wrestler’s career with the number three, as it represents a finality in the ring, but when looking at Cena’s legacy, it boils down to a trio of personas that embodied the superstar who defined a generation.\n\nFrom an in-ring perspective, Cena’s style worked incredibly well for what it was.\n\nNever a high-flyer or traditional worker — there’s a reason it took until his final months for Cena to capture the WWE Intercontinental Championship, known as the worker’s title — the early portions of Cena’s career became defined by a power-based attack and a moveset that came to be known as the “Five Moves of Doom,” which would usually be unleashed after taking a beating from his opponent and ultimately result in a win. The rinse-and-repeat formula earned him the nickname “Super Cena” from fans who were disenfranchised with the repetitive nature of his matches.\n\nStill, there were many high points that proved these criticisms of Cena to be largely unfounded and subjective.\n\nDuring the late 2000s, Cena’s rivalries with Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton and Edge produced classics that still hold up today. His return at the 2008 Royal Rumble is among the biggest in the history of the event. Cena headlined six WrestleManias, including three consecutive from 2011 to 2013, wrestling a pair of underrated matches against Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in a proverbial passing-of-the-torch moment. His 2011 Money in the Bank championship match against CM Punk still stands out as one of the best of his career and helped cement Punk’s status as a legend in WWE.\n\nCena’s style was what fit for himself and WWE at the time. It was part of what made him such an excellent contrast with the likes of Michaels, Edge, Punk and, later in his career, AJ Styles, all of whom had higher in-ring work rates. He also had seemingly limitless strength, lifting Big Show, Mark Henry and, at times, multiple wrestlers onto his shoulders for his Attitude Adjustment finisher.\n\nThe arrival of Styles helped Cena shed any perceived slights about his in-ring ability. Cena and Styles met for the first time on a WWE PLE at Money in the Bank in 2016, but their best match of that initial run came at SummerSlam that same year. It was an instant classic, showcasing the contrasting styles of both men and seemingly unlocking something in Cena as the quality of his matches quickly began to outweigh the sheer quantity of them.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Cena also quelled misconceptions about burying talent. Alongside the “Super Cena” critiques came the notion that his star shined at the expense of younger talent. While it’s not an uncommon criticism at the top of the card in professional wrestling, in Cena's case, he played a pivotal role in introducing the Nexus and elevating the United States Championship, with his open challenge serving as the main roster introductions for the likes of Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn.\n\nThis final run as an in-ring performer has been among Cena’s best — again, quality over quantity.\n\nCena’s shown a mastery of ring psychology, an expanded moveset and the same Herculean power that made him one of the greatest of all time. Renewed rivalries with Orton and Punk have hit every note of nostalgia you would expect. His final match with Cody Rhodes provided both another five-star effort and his own passing-of-the-torch moment, 12 years after WrestleMania 29. His reunion with AJ Styles was a swan song for two icons that will not be matched any time soon. Perhaps the most telling thing about Cena's entire run is that, despite what he has said in interviews about this final year, he never appeared to slow down in the ring.\n\nIn many ways, Cena probably shouldn’t have been as successful as he has been. After bursting onto the scene in 2001 more as “The Prototype” than “John Cena,” it took the Massachusetts native some time to find his footing in WWE.\n\nUltimately, Cena’s charisma and talent as an entertainer won out, leading to his freestyle-rapping, jersey-wearing “Doctor of Thuganomics” character. What feels dated in 2025 worked immensely for Cena 20 years ago, connecting him with the crowd in a way that would only enhance and evolve at seemingly every turn for the next two decades.\n\nCena faced two major transitional hurdles in his career, particularly as he moved up the card in WWE.\n\nFirst, with Stone Cold Steve Austin retired and The Rock focused on Hollywood, there was a void as WWE moved from the beloved “Attitude Era” around 2002 into what is now looked back on as the “Ruthless Aggression Era.” Cena — and fellow OVW standouts Batista, Brock Lesnar and Orton — helped bridge the gap, even with legends like The Undertaker, Michaels and Triple H still occupying main-event slots, but none reached the heights that Cena did.\n\nThe second challenge ran parallel to the first. While violence and sex appeal helped WWE win the Monday Night Wars, the company was set to move into a more family-friendly direction by the summer of 2008: The “PG Era.”\n\nCena, after rising to fame as the “Doctor of Thuganomics,” essentially scrubbed his character, trading the throwback jerseys for brightly colored WWE-branded merch, renaming his signature move from its original moniker — the F-U — and weaving in themes of patriotism and military after starring in “The Marine.” While the trademark intensity was still there, the message and tone shifted in a way that matched the direction WWE wanted to go and cemented Cena as the purest babyface character of the past quarter century.\n\nThroughout all of it, Cena’s ability to connect with an audience and deliver meaningful promos never wavered. There was merchandise, catchphrases, a rap album — including his own now-timeless theme — movies, commercials and plenty more that all played a role in building Cena up into one of the most impactful entertainers in pro-wrestling history.\n\nAs Cena’s career progressed, particularly as he shifted from full-time WWE superstar to dipping his foot into the Hollywood pond, a new authenticity came when he picked up the microphone in the ring. Rather than sticking strictly to kayfabe, Cena consistently broke the fourth wall in a way that elevated his segments, while also serving as a wink and a nod to a professional wrestling culture that was increasingly online and connected to behind-the-scenes happenings.\n\nEven during his retirement tour, Cena showed new depth as an entertainer. Say what you will about his overall 2025 heel run, Cena strung us along in the early part of the year and the turn itself was arguably as stunning as we’ve seen since July 7, 1996. Then, when it was time to turn again, Cena flipped the switch and it was back to business.\n\nThe final pillar of Cena’s legacy is perhaps the most important. Beyond the 17 world championships or the millions of dollars in merchandise and tickets sold stands Cena’s role as an ambassador for WWE.\n\nFor 20 years, Cena served as a reliable spokesperson for WWE, capable of presenting the very best the company had to offer with a squeaky-clean image and charisma for days.\n\nWWE needed to promote an event? Send Cena to Kimmel or Conan.\n\nNickelodeon needs a host for the Kid’s Choice Awards? Call Cena.\n\nFor a billion-dollar company, Cena was the QB1 of QB1s when it came to public relations, but it stretched beyond that.\n\nCena has worked extensively with Make-A-Wish throughout his career, granting more than 650 wishes for sick children and their families as the current Guinness World Record holder for the foundation. As much as the IWC will debate star ratings or get into tribal feuds over promotions, Cena’s generosity and kind heart are an undeniable measure of his greatness not just as a performer, but as a human being.\n\nCena embraced his role as a real-life superhero for millions of kids, offering up just a few minutes of his time to brighten up the lives of those who needed it most.\n\nHaving examined the elements that made Cena who he is today, we have to ask how do you sum it all up?\n\nHave there been and will there be better wrestlers than Cena? Yes.\n\nHave there been and will there be better entertainers than Cena? Yes, but there’s so much subjectivity involved that it’s very much up for debate.\n\nHave there been or will there be better ambassadors than Cena? Almost certainly not.\n\nIn a world built on kayfabe, Cena brought an authenticity that overcame industry-wide shifts, thriving across multiple decades, showcasing longevity that lasted from flip phones to FaceTime.\n\nIn a landscape that begs for change — in character or company — Cena embodied his motto, “hustle, loyalty, respect\" better than maybe anyone ever, and when he did turn, the wrestling world collectively said “no thanks, we like it better the old way.”\n\nWith the last time finally being now, it’s all clear:\n\nWe won’t see another John Cena again.",

    "description": "AEW star Bryan Danielson explains why he wasn't bothered by his WWE WrestleMania 28 loss, which saw him get beaten by Sheamus in eighteen seconds",
    "fullText": "It's hard to believe that the moment that arguably kickstarted Bryan Danielson to WWE, and later AEW superstardom, wasn't when he won the Undisputed Championship at WrestleMania 30, but was a moment that left fans in the uproar. Indeed, Danielson's success story can be traced back to a WrestleMania 28 match with Sheamus, where the latter defeated Danielson to win the World Heavyweight Championship in 18 seconds. It was a booking decision seemingly made to get Sheamus over, only it instead rallied the fans around the heel Danielson, leading to a groundswell of support that has arguably continued to this day.\n\nAppearing on \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet,\" Danielson reminisced on the moment, even sharing a funny interaction with a co-worker backstage after the loss. He also explained why the months that followed led to him not being all that upset with how things turned out.\n\n\"When they had Sheamus beat me in 18 seconds at WrestleMania...28 maybe...the fans were just 'Yesing!' like crazy when I went out there,\" Danielson said. \"You could tell they were bummed when the match was so short. Then I walked to the back and The Great Khali of all people was like 'That was f*****g b******t!' And I was like 'Oh! Khali, I didn't know you cared. Thank you!' But then, like, the next night I was like 'Okay, well, there's a lot of people 'Yesing!'' But it just kept going. That was kind of...when after a couple of months after that, and it was still happening, I was like 'Okay. This is going to be here for a bit.'\"\n\nEven if it hadn't worked out that way, Danielson still seemed to indicate that the loss wouldn't have bothered him too much. Though he admitted that he was confused by WWE's decision at the time, he also admitted he didn't fight the decision, partially because it wasn't in his nature to begin with, and also because he feels that isn't the best course. He then pointed to an AEW star and former rival of his as an example of how to handle situations like that.\n\n\"I've never been somebody who's like 'Wait a second, why would you beat me in 18 seconds?'\" Danielson said. \"Or 'Why would you just beat me with one move?' or whatever. I was like 'Okay, that's the creative direction. I'm going to do the best I can with it.' I find that a lot of people put up stinks about a lot of things, whatever it is...You could put up a little resistance if you really don't like something.\n\n\"But then if this is what the boss wants, you're better off to do your absolute best at what the boss wants, and then try to get over from that. I think a great example in AEW is Swerve Strickland. He came in and he lost a lot of matches. But it was always 'Yes sir Tony. Whatever you need, I'll go out there and do.' And now look at him. He's main evented PPV's. He's a World Champion. He's fantastic.\"\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet\" and provide an h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Ricky Saints cost Je'Von Evans the NXT Championship in his challenge against Oba Femi in the main event of \"WWE NXT.\"\n\nEvans interrupted Saints earlier in the show as the former champion sought a rematch for the title he had lost at Deadline. And given that Evans was the Iron Survivor coming out of the same event, he made the case that he should get the next opportunity at the title and didn't want to wait for New Year's Evil. Saints originally pushed back on the idea, but Evans appeared to talk him down and he stepped aside for Evans to challenge Femi in the main event.\n\nThe challenger went on to endure everything the champion could throw at him, getting the better of things on the outside of the ring before returning and seeming to have the match under wraps. He connected with his springboard cutter and went for what looked like the winning cover, only for the referee to be yanked from the ring before the three-count could be made.\n\nEvans turned to realize that it was Saints that had cost him, with them staring one another down as Femi got back to his feet. He clattered his challenger with a lariat, delivering the finishing powerbomb for the winning pinfall.\n\nAfter the match, Femi walked off with his title, confirming that it will be him going into this weekend's Saturday Night's Main Event against WWE Champion, Cody Rhodes. He gave a disapproving look to Saints, who simply shrugged it off and continued to smile at Evans defeated in the ring as the show went off air.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.
