    "description": "A new trademark filed by WWE is potentially lending credence to a specific outcome of AJ Styles vs. GUNTHER at the 2026 Royal Rumble.",
    "fullText": "Heading into the 2026 WWE Royal Rumble, multiple things are pointing to AJ Styles possibly losing to GUNTHER, then retiring from in-ring competition. The latest backing that outcome is a filing from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nFor weeks, the WWE Universe and WWE commentators have referred to GUNTHER as \"The Career Killer,\" given that he successfully put the careers of John Cena and WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg to rest in 2025. On Monday, filed to trademark \"Career Killer\" with the USPTO, potentially lending further credence to the scenario of GUNTHER defeating Styles at the Royal Rumble, where \"The Phenomenal One\" will put his career on the line.\n\nThis trademark application specifically aims to cover entertainment services related to professional wrestling, such as digital and broadcast media. As of this writing, the application is awaiting assignment to an examining attorney.\n\nSince GUNTHER bested Cena in his retirement match at the December 13 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Styles has demanded that \"The Career Killer\" show some respect to the legends that came before him in WWE, like Cena. Instead, GUNTHER has repeatedly shrugged off Styles' words and controversially beat him in a singles match on \"WWE Raw.\"\n\nAccording to fellow WWE star Shinsuke Nakamura, Styles previously disclosed to him that the 2026 Royal Rumble will indeed mark his retirement match. The social media post containing this information has since been deleted, suggesting that Nakamura may have accidently spoiled the result of GUNTHER vs. Styles. As always, though, WWE events are subject to change.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines. You can also add us as a preferred search source on Google.",

    "fullText": "Joe Root hopes Harry Brook's 'beer smash' celebration will be \"received the right way\".\n\nThe England captain marked his match-winning century against Sri Lanka by imitating a famous WWE wrestler.\n\nBrook was recently involved in a late-night drinking scandal where he was struck by a bouncer the night before captaining a match in New Zealand.\n\nThe 27-year-old was almost sacked as captain as a result, but was ultimately given a final warning for his off-field behaviour and fined the maximum amount of £30,000.\n\nWhen Brook reached three figures in Colombo following an astonishing, series-winning 57-ball century, he celebrated by taking off his batting gloves, striking them together and then tipping them towards his mouth.\n\nThe move was first performed by former WWE wrestler 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin, who would have two beers thrown to him on stage, before hitting them together and drinking them in the ring.\n\nBrook confirmed after the match that the celebration was a tribute to Austin, and also an acknowledgement of his attempts to win back the trust of his team-mates.\n\n\"It was just more about celebrating tonight with the boys,\" Brook explained.\n\n\"Like I said the other day in my press conference, I've got to try and gain that trust back with the lads and the way I wanted to do that was perform, play well and lead from the front.\"\n\nRoot, who was batting with Brook at the time, said he hoped Brook's celebration would be received with the humour it was intended.\n\n\"I think that's his way of doing that really,\" Root said. \"He's trying to show he wants that approval from the group, through humour.\n\n\"That's another area of why he's going to be a great leader, because he has that side to him as well.\n\n\"He's showed his calmness and his clarity under pressure, and he's also showed humour as well in doing that.\n\n\"Hopefully it's received in the right way because there's definitely no malice behind it, or anything other than trying to have a bit of a joke with his team-mates.\"",

    "description": "On a night that saw CM Punk wrestle AJ Styles (to a DQ) here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 1/26/26 episode of \"WWE Raw!\"",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s weekly review of \"WWE Raw,\" the show where we might have had a new World Heavyweight Champion if not for that meddling Irishman! Yes, Finn Balor interrupted a world title match between CM Punk and the possibly-retiring-soon AJ Styles this week, and boy do we ever have thoughts about it! In fact, fully half our column is devoted to that match and its aftermath, simply because the WINC staff had such strong feelings — but don't think we're neglecting the rest of the card! We might not be talking about Alpha Academy's big win, but we will certainly discuss the entire Vision making it into the rapidly-filling Royal Rumble match, as well as the follow-up from Natalya's heel turn and the six-woman tag team bout that served as the show's in-ring opener.\n\nIf you missed Monday's festivities in Toronto, feel free to catch up via our \"Raw\" results page. If you want to know what the WINC crew thought of the show, this is the place to be. Here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 1/26/26 episode of \"WWE Raw!\"\n\nLast week, Nattie unceremoniously turned heel when she put Becky Lynch's foot on the rope to screw Maxxine Dupri. Why Nattie, why? We found out *checks notes* in a video that aired during \"Raw.\"\n\nIn the video, Nattie says Maxxine failed her. \"You think because you rolled with a legend, you could roll like a legend?\" She says that'll never happen because she's \"a whole new me.\" The former \"Queen of Harts\" declared that when she's done with Maxxine, she's coming for everything as it cuts to a clip of Becky Lynch holding the Women's IC title. The video ends with \"because Natalya elevates, Nattie dominates.\" That's a really great line and I love that we've been getting the \"Low Key Legend\" on WWE programming, which is what makes this even more frustrating.\n\nThe heel turn was done hastily. If you want to sell people on the heel turn, why would you have the follow up be in a video? That should have been an in-ring segment, especially because they were in her home country of Canada. Imagine the heat she could've gotten from her fellow Canadians if she said all of this in the ring. She should have said it directly to Dupri and the fans could've deduced that Nattie was coming from the IC title since that was the title on the line during the match that she interfered in. This version of Nattie is the most compelling she's been in a while and it would better be served in the ring now that we've had all the vignettes of her training Dupri. At the very least, it could've been a backstage segment with Jackie Redmond questioning her actions.\n\nAt Saturday Night's Main Event this past weekend, Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY defended their women's tag titles against Liv Morgan and Roxanne Perez. It was a very good match that some might say was marred by interference from Raquel Rodriguez and Stephanie Vaquer. So naturally, on \"Raw,\" all three female members of The Judgment Day teamed up against Ripley, SKY, and Vaquer in a six-woman tag match.\n\nWhile the SNME match had the advantage of having stakes, the \"Raw\" match was overall better, essentially being run as the exact same thing but without the interference and with Vaquer (always a delight in the ring) and Rodriguez, who is thriving in her current role as TJD's heavy hitter. Sure, Perez took the fall this time instead of Morgan, but the finish was essentially the same beyond that, and it was an overwhelmingly fun match with a clean ending on a show that didn't have a ton of that. Two really good matches in three days? Not sure how much more we could reasonably ask for from these six.\n\nWell, it looks like WWE is indeed not planning on running any kind of match between Bron Breakker and \"Raw\" General Manager Adam Pearce anytime soon.\n\nGiven that things between Breakker and Pearce have become incredibly heated on multiple occasions, I expected their face-to-face tonight to be much more tense than it actually ended up being. All that really happened during this several minute segment was Adam Pearce briefly apologizing to Breakker, announcing The Vision all had spots in the 2026 Men's Royal Rumble, and setting up the subsequent match between Austin Theory and Rey Mysterio. It felt like it was a major let down when all was said and done, especially considering that it was one of the bigger segments on tonight's show amidst the few segments that was properly advertised ahead of tonight's show. I know that we're talking about WWE and I've learned to not get my hopes up after watching this company week in and week out, but I still expected more from this segment and was vastly disappointed by what came out of it.\n\nWell, this weekend is sure being built as though it's going to be AJ Styles' last hoorah in WWE. Monday's show saw him come out to address the crowd before being interrupted by World Heavyweight Champion and fellow indie darling-turned-WWE legend CM Punk.\n\nThe two then did essentially an improv skit, teasing the crowd with the idea of them having their first and potentially only ever singles match in the near future, only to then bemoan the fact that they may not be able to if Gunther wins; with a big old grin on his face Styles feigned offense at the idea he couldn't beat Gunther, saying he could beat Punk and thus after a lot of self-indulgent, \"Yeah we know this is the match you want,\" back and forth it was finally announced they would face each other in the main event.\n\nThe main event itself was unfortunately a shell of what it would have been 20 or even 10 years ago. But that's by no means intended to say it was bad. It was what you would expect from two of the greatest wrestlers in the world throughout the 2000-10s in 2026. I was born in 2000 and grew up with Styles and Punk as two of my favorite wrestlers, and while watching Styles in TNA and Punk in WWE there had always been that question over if they would ever step in the ring together.\n\nThat sentimentality helped to bridge any form of gap in terms of the match quality. This was a moment both in each man's careers but for me as a wrestling fan. Even if it was a moment that very could and maybe should, in another life, have been on the marquee for WrestleMania.\n\nPunk and Styles exchanged their greatest hits and the story was there, once again teasing the audience with the idea that Styles could win his third World title just days before a career threatening match. There was a really close near-fall on a Styles Clash, Punk had Styles almost counted out with a GTS on the floor, and everything was building to a great climax. That was until...\n\n...Finn Balor showed up after teasing a babyface turn to cause a disqualification in the main event between Styles and Punk. And that's just annoying, because nothing good can ever not come with a bait-and-switch.\n\nBalor was Punk's last challenger when \"Raw\" hit Northern Ireland, wrestling what was, for all intents and purposes, a pretty babyface performance. Go figure, since it was an Irish crowd and he is an Irish star. It's not as though we haven't seen the home hero play up to the crowd for one night only, but then during this week's show he walked up all respectful and potentially turning a new leaf as he thanked Punk for the night and the opportunity. Punk then said he should consider leaving the Judgment Day, because Punk clearly watches the product as well, and Balor looked to be genuinely considering it. Progress.\n\nAnother backstage segment rolled around, and Balor was looking to continue turning that leaf with an entry into the Royal Rumble. Adam Pearce said that the Rumble was full, which is hilariously odd considering the very nature of the Rumble. That sent Balor into perhaps the most reasonable crash out in WWE history. And then Liv Morgan hit Balor with the \"I heard what Punk said\" and then that appeared to be all she wrote. But no, Balor turned up during the main event to attack Punk while he had Styles on his shoulders. One thing. Can we not just have one stinking thing? I get that Balor should continue his world title program, and I am a massive fan of Balor's work in the ring, but it didn't have to come at the detriment of yet another main event and the only bit of progress WWE had made in Balor's arc of late.\n\nBalor could very well have done the attack on Punk after the match had concluded to close the show. To the presumed counter-argument that Styles couldn't lose before facing Gunther, there are a few prepared responses: Styles losing would add an added sense of jeopardy to the match that has his career on the line; Styles losing wouldn't exactly make a difference to the significance of this weekend; Styles losing to Punk is not a major loss even if he is planned to beat Gunther, Punk is World Champion presumably heading into WrestleMania; Styles did lose, he lost by disqualification.\n\nIt's just annoying to be given something in a way that says, \"Hey, we're throwing this dream match out on TV because we don't know if we will have another chance,\" and it wind up with, \"Sike, you'll get what you're given and what you're given is the exact same every week.\"\n\nI can't say I expected a big main event push, especially a pretty interesting one, for Finn Balor in the year 2026, but I also can't say I'm disappointed by it, as a fan of his. I didn't think any more would come of Balor and CM Punk's story in the ring after Balor lost to the World Heavyweight Champion in his home country of Ireland a few weeks ago, and I'm glad to be wrong. Balor's story tonight was kind of a rollercoaster, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nIt started off with babyface turn tease in a backstage segment with Punk, when Balor thanked him for what he did at the end of their match last week, when Punk raised his hand to celebrate in front of the Irish crowd. Punk then told Balor if he wanted to become champion, he needed to leave Judgment Day. The faction's breakup has been an ongoing story for what feels like forever now on \"Raw,\" I thought we actually might be headed toward it this time. Liv Morgan wasn't a huge fan of that, as we saw in another backstage segment, which did further the power struggle storyline between the two of them, which I thought was good no matter what Balor decided to do.\n\nBalor then went to do the right thing and ask \"Raw\" General Manager Adam Pearce if he could enter the Royal Rumble, doing the honorable thing to try and get another title match, and Pearce told him the Rumble match was full. That's when I started to think Balor wasn't actually turning face like they'd be teasing, because now, he has to whip some a**, perhaps maybe even pulling out The Demon, to get into the match. Or, he could just go out there and attack Punk during his main event match with AJ Styles, like we saw at the end of the night tonight. If \"Raw\" was going to end in yet another DQ, at least it was Balor doing something rather than The Vision.\n\nIf we're not just speed running Styles' retirement tour, I think he gets a match against Balor. WWE would never acknowledge the meeting of the former Bullet Club leaders, but fans would sure know. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, because I do think Styles retires at the Royal Rumble, but a Styles vs. Balor short storyline and number one contender's match would be really good. The Royal Rumble is certainly shaping up to be an interesting PLE for many different reasons, and I'm excited to see what happens for Balor moving forward.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "In a matter of days, 30 men and 30 women will step into the WWE Royal Rumble matches with the aim of securing themselves a title shot of their choosing at WrestleMania 42. For the past two years, Carmelo Hayes has been amongst the men receiving such an opportunity, with his 2024 Royal Rumble appearance spanning a respectable 17 minutes. During an interview with \"No Holds Barred,\" he reflected on his previous experience in the over-the-top-rope spectacle, while also looking ahead to the upcoming one.\n\n\"The opportunity to be in the Rumble is same as every year,\" he said. \"It's a huge opportunity. I mean, you can make yourself a star. You don't even got to win the Rumble half the time. You can make yourself a star in however long you get that opportunity to be in there. Mix it up with different guys. I think it's a cool opportunity to see guys mixing up with guys that you've never seen before. There's a lot of Raw guys that I've never got to really interact with. Also on top of that, all the surprises that they have, new guys coming in or old guys coming back, whatever it may be. I'm excited for the Royal Rumble.\"\n\nIn the 2025 iteration, Hayes emerged as the first elimination from the Men's Royal Rumble match, courtesy of then-Intercontinental Champion Bron Breakker. On his way to the back, however, Hayes left a lasting impression on the audience by attacking Akira Tozawa, which allowed popular streamer IShowSpeed to fill in as a surprise replacement.\n\nThe 2026 premium live event and its corresponding matches will emanate from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on January 31.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"No Holds Barred\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

Through it, TNA stars such as Frankie Kazarian have been able to appear on WWE programming, while \"WWE NXT\" talents have returned the favor with a number of outings in TNA. On a recent edition of \"Two Man Power Trip,\" Kazarian weighed in on the ongoing partnership.\n\n\"It's been beneficial, that goes without saying, for us, and I think it's been beneficial for NXT,\" he said. \"A lot of those guys that come up in that system, they learn what WWE wants to teach them, which is their way of doing television and matches and all that. Coming to TNA, they get kind of a different taste. It's a bit looser, a lot more freedom when it comes to promos and stuff. There's a little bit less micromanagement, so it's really cool for them to see that side of it.\n\n\"For me, all the stuff I've been able to do at NXT last year, I had a blast,\" he continued. \"They really treated me great. They rolled out the red carpet for me. It was cool just to be part of that crossover.\"\n\nIn Kazarian's case, he has wrestled for \"NXT\" on two occasions, the latest of which saw him and three other TNA men — Moose, Mike Santana, and Leon Slater — defeated four of \"NXT's\" top talents in a Survivor Series-style match in October. Months before that, Kazarian made his \"NXT\" debut in a battle royal to determine the number one contender to the NXT Championship.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Two Man Power Trip\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

In the case of former WWE Tag Team Champions Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins, that same uncertainty has lingered for months. Thanks to a new report, though, it can finally be put to rest.\n\nAccording to PWI Elite, the absence of Rusev and The Street Profits (Ford and Dawkins) on WWE television is the result of an internal decision to not waste them from a creative standpoint. As such, Rusev and The Street Profits are not currently involved in any storylines, reportedly as an effort to keep them \"fresh\" for when WWE officials approach them with new TV programs.\n\nRusev's last television match came on the December 6 edition of \"WWE Main Event,\" in which he defeated Alpha Academy's Otis. Prior to that, \"The Bulgarian Brute\" took on Jey Uso in the quarter finals of \"The Last Time Is Now\" tournament, but lost.\n\nThe WWE Universe last saw The Street Profits in the ring on the November 1 episode of \"Main Event,\" with the pair defeating Los Garza's Angel and Berto in tag team competition. Throughout 2025, Ford and Dawkins were a regular fixture in the \"WWE SmackDown\" tag team division, even holding the WWE Tag Team Championships from March until July.\n\nIn recent weeks, Rusev, Ford, and Dawkins have all appeared on promotional materials for the 2026 WWE Royal Rumble, which will emanate from Saudi Arabia on January 31.

After successfully turning the crowd, McIntyre made it clear Cody Rhodes won’t be getting a rematch.\n\nDespite focusing a decent amount of their recent rivalry on his ability to pick the stipulations of their match, McIntyre left out that he apparently had General Manager Nick Aldis put in place a clause that eliminated the chance of a rematch for Rhodes.\n\nDrew McIntyre says that he had Nick Aldis add a clause to the 3 Stages Of Hell Contract that states Cody Rhodes doesn't get a rematch for the WWE Championship!\n\nCody has to start at the bottom and build back up.#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/2Sq4TvMAsI\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nRandy Orton was quick to hit the ring afterward to threaten McIntyre before Jacob Fatu arrived and actually threw hands with the champ. Fatu attacked McIntyre, who ultimately jumped over the guardrail and escaped \"The Samoan Werewolf\" through the audience.\n\nThe Miz took a page out of Orton’s book and popped up behind the Viper, hitting him with a Skull Crushing Finale before the referee started the first of four qualifying matches.\n\nJacob Fatu didn't come for a chat...\n\nFATU BEATS DOWN MCINTYRE AND CHASES HIM OUT OF THE ARENA!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/yO80imGAG6\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nTHE MIZ SKULL CRUSHING FINALE'S RANDY ORTON!\n\nTheir qualifying match STARTS NOW!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/faeieVEVOv\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nAfter last week’s brief interaction, Miz briefly had the upper hand before Orton gave the fans what they wanted. Orton played the greatest hits and landed a powerslam, made his way to the outside, and tossed Miz onto the announce table, then connected on his middle rope DDT.\n\nMiz hit another Skull Crushing Finale, but it wasn’t enough to put Orton away. Instead, Orton reversed a rollup, hit an RKO and earned the first spot in the Fatal 4-Way at Saturday Night’s Main Event to become the No. 1 contender for the WWE Undisputed Championship.\n\nRKO OUT OF NO WHERE!\n\nRANDY ORTON DEFEATS THE MIZ!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/HFaiaymezX\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nBefore Alexa Bliss and Charlotte Flair hit the ring to battle Giulia and Kiana James, Bliss questioned if Flair was actually sick last week or just pretending. The duo continue to tease their ability to coexist before Bliss walked away, and Nia Jax and Lash Legend got in Flair’s head about her partner.\n\nThat made no impact on the match, and this one went about as expected. Giulia did her best to keep her team afloat, but a tag for James opened the door for Bliss to hit Sister Abigail for the pinfall. After the match, Jax and Legend hit the ring, taking out Bliss and Flair before Giulia was held back trying to get in their faces.\n\nNia Jax & Lash Legend try to give Charlotte some advice about Alexa Bliss, but Charlotte wasn't having any of it.#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/NIL1oXeAHl\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nRhodes hit the ring and questioned if things got too formulaic on his latest title run. For some reason, he was content not getting a title rematch and said he was ready to fight from the bottom back to the top.\n\nRhodes declared himself for the Royal Rumble and called out Fatu, who he said had the biggest receipt coming his way.\n\n\"I wasn't just the companies Champion, I was your Champion!\"\n\n- Cody Rhodes, and then the crowd boos 👀#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/IywMkuzAI3\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nCODY RHODES HAS DECLARED FOR THE ROYAL RUMBLE!\n\nHe plans to win it for a 3rd time!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/rxPf5b33yg\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nTrick Williams and Matt Cardona were put in tough positions. It’s clear Williams is being positioned as the cocky, fresh talent arriving after success in NXT. He’s also massively over and giving Williams some early momentum could avoid some of the pitfalls WWE encountered with Carmelo Hayes and his arrival from NXT. At the same time, Cardona felt like a big deal in his return from the indies back to the WWE.\n\nSlotting these two into a No. 1 contender’s qualifying match put WWE in a no-win situation, with one of the two having to eat a loss. Between the two, Williams was a great choice to advance into the No. 1 contender’s qualifying match, showing WWE’s faith in how far he can climb.\n\nAfter the match, Kit Wilson made his way to the ring and added insult to injury by attacking Cardona.\n\nTRICK SHOT\n\nTRICK WILLIAMS BEATS MATT CARDONA!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/6gj7ycFwcT\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nWilson was in the ring cutting a promo about toxic masculinity before Fatu popped up behind him, superkicked him out of the ring, and called out Rhodes. It seems for now, Fatu has moved on from the promotion’s champion, McIntyre, and is good with tossing hands with the former champ, Rhodes.\n\nRhodes wasted no time running to the ring before security filled the ring and kept the duo apart. I said in Uncrowned's recent breakout stars piece that Fatu needs to be elevated onto the same field as the likes of Rhodes — and here we are. He’ll get a match with Rhodes at Saturday Night’s Main Event.\n\nThe Wyatt Sicks and the MFT traded promos reflecting on their struggle over the lantern that was stolen from the Wyatt Sicks before Solo Sikoa fought Damian Priest in the No. 1 contender’s qualifying match.\n\nAs the MFT made their presence felt, setting Priest back over and again, it was the Wyatt Sicks who eventually evened the score and worked to get back the lantern. Uncle Howdy nearly wrapped his hands around it before Sikoa ran out from the ring and tossed him over the announce table.\n\nThat distraction provided the opening for Priest to hit the South of Heaven chokeslam for the pinfall victory. After the match, as Uncle Howdy was about to get the lantern, Talla Tonga set him down and snatched it.\n\nNext week will see the factions face off for the WWE Tag Team championship.\n\nUNCLE HOWDY TRIES TO TAKE THE LANTERN\n\nSOLO SIKOA STOPS HIM, BUT THE DISTRACTION COSTS HIM\n\nSOUTH OF HEAVEN FROM DAMIAN PRIEST\n\nPRIEST WINS!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/hhM7wqGsQG\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nWe got a nice glimpse into the future of WWE with U.S. Champion Carmelo Hayes and Leon Slater competing in an absolute barnburner.\n\nThe duo opened the bout with a frenetic pace, with Slater living up to be every bit the legit challenger he is. Despite Hayes appearing to tweak his knee early in the match, the two proved to be perfect dance partners in a match that never slowed.\n\nHayes and Slater wrestled with pace and precision, they traded technical submissions, and creativity in a really refreshing tilt. Slater came up just short, but as wrestling’s worst kept secret, his stock is well on the rise.\n\nIt was also another feather in the cap for Hayes, whose 2026 is off to a great start.\n\nINVERTED SPRINGBOARD SPANISH FLY 🤯#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/b5ZScadimi\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nOVER THE RING POST OUTSIDE DIVE FROM SLATER 🤯#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/cH8IiUo7c1\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nHOLY SH*T 🤯🤯🤯\n\nSUPER DUPER CUTTER OFF THE TOP FROM MELO\n\nMELO RETAINS THE US CHAMPIONSHIP!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/eHL198AcmM\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nShinsuke Nakamura was seen watching the United States Championship match backstage before Tama Tonga confronted him. Tonga warned that after the MFT win the tag-team titles, he’s coming for the U.S. belt and that Nakamura needs to stay out of his way.\n\nAxiom demanded his mask back from Johnny Gargano backstage, who said he didn’t know anything about it. Nathan Frazer was wearing another mask and hit Gargano, then said they’ll have a match next week. Frazer and Axiom laughed before walking off.\n\nChelsea Green is maybe the most underrated talent on the roster. She gets plenty of love, but is still somehow undervalued. She can put on great matches, is entertaining, and makes her opponents look like gold.\n\nGreen was the perfect opponent for Jordynne Grace, who has been elevated right into the main-event picture. Another competitive match saw Grace pin Green clean, then confront the WWE Women’s Champion, Jade Cargill, who was seated at ringside.\n\nGreen attempted to attack Grace from behind, but knocked Cargill off the apron, dropping the title into the ring. Grace posed with it before tossing the belt back to Cargill.\n\nCARTWHEEL DRIVER FROM JORDYNNE GRACE\n\nSHE BEATS CHELSEA GREEN!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/gM2ZnkkOkV\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nJordynne Grace addresses Jade Cargill after her match and calls her out into the ring!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/UjqAdAOH90\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nMcIntyre had two very different reactions to these two challengers confronting him backstage. McIntyre virtually ignored Dragunov as he was running from Fatu, but laughed off Zayn, leaning on his unbeaten record against the challenger.\n\nDragunov and Zayn then put on an absolute war from the opening bell. They stomped each other, showed technical expertise, and Dragunov got cut open early in the match with blood pouring down the side of his face.\n\nDragunov attempted the H-Bomb from the corner, but a front kick put him on his heels. Zayn later missed on a Helluva Kick, and they kept the pressure on each other. The two competitors played with the London audience’s emotions, with near-falls and a moment where Zayn narrowly escaped a count-out loss.\n\nDRAGUNOV SCOUTS THE HELLUVA KICK!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/axSkApiJsY\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nTORPEDO MOSCOW ON THE APRON!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/ayyItc5cJ8\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nZayn eventually put Dragunov away with an exploder suplex, then a Helluva Kick for the win, proving the confrontations earlier in the evening accurate as proper foreshadowing. Dragunov appears to be another breakout candidate for someone who likely belongs in the main event moving forward, while Zayn is right on the cusp of fighting for the title in Riyadh at the Royal Rumble.\n\nAs Zayn celebrated his win, Williams followed him with a Trick Shot, standing over his challenger as the show went off the air.\n\nHELLUVA KICK\n\nSAMI ZAYN WINS!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/hfM7LBqPT7\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\nTRICK WILLIAMS ATTACKS SAMI ZAYN\n\nTRICK WILLIAMS HITS THE TRICK SHOT ON SAMI\n\nTRICK WILLIAMS CLOSES THE SHOW ON TOP!#SmackDown pic.twitter.com/HhvbbMC3SJ\n\n— The Movement - Pro Wrestling (@TheMovementXx) January 16, 2026\n\n👑 After another exceptional episode of “Smackdown,” I give this show a Crown score of: 9/10. 👑",

    "fullText": "Following John Cena's final match of his career last month at Saturday Night's Main Event, and AJ Styles' being open about his own retirement to come in 2026, which he confirmed at Crown Jewel, other veteran wrestlers within the industry have been asked when they plan on hanging up their boots. World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk, who helped send Cena off alongside Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes, has said he's \"not going anywhere anytime soon,\" but recently clarified to CinemaBlend when he does plan on finishing up in the ring.\n\n\"When I was 15, if you asked me if I'd be wrestling when I was 40, I would tell you, 'No, that's crazy. 40 is so old,'\" Punk told the outlet. \"I'm 47, and I don't feel old yet. Terry Funk wrestled for a long time, Ric Flair wrestled for a long time. I mean, there's luchadors that are like in their 70s that are still doing it. Do I want to be doing that? Probably not. I would estimate probably the big 50 is when I should maybe gracefully bow out. Knock on wood, if nothing else horrible happens.\"\n\nSince his return from the injury at SummerSlam that August, Punk has remained healthy throughout feuds with Drew McIntyre and Seth Rollins, as well as for numerous big matches. He captured the then-vacant World Heavyweight title at Saturday Night's Main Event in November.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "WWE Hall of Famer \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin named two performers while discussing his greatest pro wrestling rivals.",
    "fullText": "\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin had a long list of rivals throughout his 13-year career, with The Rock, Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle being among some of the best. According to \"The Rattlesnake,\" however, one wrestler stands above the rest as his greatest in-ring adversary.\n\nSpeaking on \"Insight\" with Chris Van Vliet, Austin named Bret Hart as his best rival inside the squared circle, stating that nobody could match the chemistry he had with \"The Hitman.\" According to Austin, their contrasting personas complimented each other.\n\n\"Bret Hart's the best there is, the best there was, there ever will be,\" Austin said. \"Bret, I love working with that guy. We just had instant chemistry. He was a student of the game and a student of other promotions and he had seen what I was doing in WCW, the Stunning Steve Austin, and he knew his style and my style would work well together and it did. Just a trash talking heel that I was, and he was that steady workaholic, working babyface ... I'm very thankful to that guy because he meant a lot to my career.\"\n\nDespite Hart being his best in-ring nemesis, Austin admitted that the biggest rival of his career was undoubtedly former WWE CEO Vince McMahon.\n\n\"Vince, great chemistry,\" he claimed. \"He was the mastermind. I don't know what he's doing now, but that was a feud that transcended the wrestling business. And even if you weren't a wrestling fan, per se, you were interested in being entertained. And so you would put on to see what this motherf****r from South Texas is terrorizing his boss from New York City.\"\n\nAlthough McMahon was Austin's greatest rival, when it came to taking his iconic Stunner, the former Chairman was arguably the worst at selling the move according to the six-time WWE Champion.\n\n\"Easily Vince is the worst,\" Austin said. \"Vince had so many opportunities and they were always so awful, especially that one at WrestleMania, whichever one it was. It was the one with Kevin Owens. ... It was just terrible, and so, I had to start laughing because I mean, you got to let everybody know that, hey man, this is really bad.\"\n\nAustin admitted that Vince's wife, Linda McMahon, also ranks high on the all-time worst Stunners list. He feels bad that the move didn't go as planned, but Austin credited her for being a second mom to him during his WWE career.\n\nThe WWE star then named which of his opponents were the best at taking the Stunner, explaining that The Rock and Scott Hall are among some of his favorites, but praised Austin Theory and Pat McAfee for the way they sold the move at WrestleMania 38.\n\n\"Good kid. I thought man, the sky was the limit for him. He took a great one. McAfee took a great one ... of course when he tumbled out of the ring, he was still drinking the beer while he's laying on the mat. F*****g classic. What an entertainer.\"\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "WWE Hall of Famer Bully Ray explains why he is not too keen on how the company promotes its young and rising stars.",
    "fullText": "Real recognizes real. And in the case of Bully Ray, the idea of a younger talent looking up to a veteran in this business is admirable, but it needs to be toned down, in his opinion. In an open discussion hours before Cody Rhodes lost the Undisputed WWE Championship to Drew McIntyre this past Friday on \"WWE SmackDown,\" the idea of how \"The American Nightmare\" could potentially bounce back from this loss was on the minds of \"Busted Open\" hosts Dave LaGreca and Ray. But before they delved into where they think WWE should take this storyline, Ray had this to say about rising stars being taken under veterans' wings.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of the WWE treating a lot of their talent like children,\" the WWE Hall of Famer said. \"You see it a lot, where a lot of younger talent [is] like, 'Oh, I'm just happy to be in the ring with you. Oh, this is a dream come true,' like with Lyra [Valkyria] and Becky [Lynch]. It worked, but...it's becoming a little too much where a lot of younger talent are deer in the headlights when it comes to the veterans.\"\n\nWhat sparked this remark from Ray came from LaGreca's take that, perhaps, Randy Orton should help train Rhodes to become a three-time Undisputed Champion, similar to how Apollo Creed trained Rocky Balboa in \"Rocky III.\" With the promise that \"The Viper\" is owed a future title match. Indeed an interesting proposal, Ray thought oppositely.\n\n\"I want Cody to eventually be looked at and talked about in the same light as everybody else, and not just because he becomes the same age as them, but because he becomes them and surpasses them as an athlete and a professional and as an entertainer and as a wrestler,\" he added. \"I don't necessarily wanna see Cody have to be taken under anybody's wing. I don't want to look at Cody as a child. I wanna look at Cody as a full-blown man.\"\n\nRhodes reclaimed the Undisputed Championship from \"The Never Seen 17\" John Cena on Night Two at SummerSlam this past August. His second reign ended at 159 days.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Busted Open Radio\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "In late 2001, WWE stars \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin and Booker T took part in a brawl filmed at a supermarket, creating an unforgettable segment.",
    "fullText": "From the moment Booker T made his 2001 WWE debut, he was at odds with \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. Though their feud never resulted in the pay-per-view blow-off that it deserved, it did lead to one of the promotion's most off-the-wall segments: the \"Supermarket Brawl.\"\n\nTaking place months into their rivalry, after Booker had not only interfered in several of Austin's matches but also stole his truck, Austin decided he would attack Booker on sight wherever he could find him. As it turned out, that included the grocery store.\n\nThe segment began with WWE cameras capturing Booker's trip to a genuine supermarket in California. As Booker shops, a voice comes over the store intercom that sounds suspiciously like Austin, and Booker takes notice. After attacking a random bald man that he mistakes for Austin, Booker is ambushed from behind by Austin, alerted just seconds before by the sound of his rival cracking open a can of beer.\n\nWhat ensues is roughly six minutes of absolute chaos inside the grocery store. Highlights include Austin tossing Booker into a display of oranges as Jerry Lawler cries out in dismay on commentary, and Booker getting doused with mustard before Austin pours various baskets and bowls of nuts on top of him.\n\nThe one-sided action continues into the storage area, as Austin pelts Booker with eggs. Finally, Booker is able to counter Austin with a kick and he takes control, successfully tossing Austin into the milk cooler. Unfortunately for Booker, Austin climbs out through the milk cartons, treats himself to a half-gallon, and continues the beatdown. The segment ends with Austin leaving Booker in a heap at the cash register as police sirens signal that it's time for him to leave.\n\nMore than 20 years later, the segment is still fondly-remembered. Booker has spoken at length about the brawl, including in a 2024 interview with former WWE star Maven Huffman. Logically, Booker and Austin only had one shot at filming, and they were largely allowed to do whatever they wanted in the store. The two knew how things were going to go until Austin attacked Booker, and nearly everything from that point on was improvised.\n\n\"I give Steve Austin a lot of credit, just because he was able to go out there ... and have that innate ability to be able to work on the fly,\" Booker said. \"All that stuff was ad-libbed. We had no script at all, you know what I mean? The pizzeria song he was singing – I was like, 'Where do you get this stuff from?'\"\n\nThe wrestler confirmed that some of the grocery store shoppers who watched the brawl were locals that were allowed to watch the filming, while others were \"plants\" who were meant to fulfill a certain role. As for the fact that Austin got nearly all of the offense in the segment, Booker doesn't have a problem with it, noting that the brawl was meant to be the moment that Austin finally got his revenge after many weeks of torment.\n\n\"One thing about this business, man – I look at myself right there and I say, 'This is the position in professional wrestling that, if you don't find yourself in one time, you haven't been in professional wrestling,'\" Booker stated. \"This is the embodiment, for me, as far as professional wrestling goes, because it is to be embellished to whatever we want it to be for our fans.\"\n\nTo this day, Booker said fans come up to him to share that this is their favorite match of his, only for the WWE star to remind them that it wasn't a match at all.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Vince McMahon's wrestling business model may be monopolistic, but according to this WWE Hall of Famer, the McMahons' tactics were just good for business.",
    "fullText": "For many years, WWE was the definition of a professional wrestling monopoly, with its complete dominance of the professional wrestling market, industry-shaping practices, and strict closed-door policy to outside promotions. While the wrestling scene has since diversified, some may argue that the McMahon dynasty's ruthless business practices were a good thing — one of those advocates being WWE Hall of Famer Dory Funk Jr.\n\nFunk Jr. was interviewed on a recent episode of News4Jax's \"Going Ringside,\" and amidst questions about his decades-long career in the professional wrestling business, Funk Jr. was asked about Vince McMahon's total takeover of the professional wrestling business. Funk Jr., coming from a pre-WWE era of several, individual, fragmented promotions, praised McMahon's business tactics.\n\n\"Yeah, Vince bought everything. It was good for the business,\" Funk Jr. admitted.\n\nWhile Funk Jr. approved of McMahon's business model, he did not dismiss the importance of rival promotions to the professional wrestling ecosystem. While he did not name any specific competitors, Funk Jr. reasoned that the emergence of new companies — both those working with and against WWE — broaden the professional wrestling world, and contribute to its overall success.\n\n\"And then, other, new companies would come along, and be working with Vince, or working against him. It was good for the wrestling business,\" Funk Jr. elaborated.\n\nFunk Jr. confirmed he keeps up with professional wrestling in the present day, though to what extent the Hall of Famer follows the current product is unclear. He applauded modern wrestling as \"good business,\" and praised today's talents for their work ethic.\n\n\"Everybody works hard to give the fans what they would like to see,\" Funk Jr. concluded. \"And...I see the fans very, very eager to get behind professional wrestling.\"\n\nWhile Funk Jr. is advanced in his years, he still contributes to the professional wrestling world through limited in-ring activities and his wrestling school.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "While wrestlers go to great lengths to condition their bodies, tidy up their appearance, and maintain their brand, wrestling itself is anything but pretty. WWE Women's EVOLVE Champion Kendal Grey learned that the hard way when a sharp knee strike to the face from reigning \"NXT\" Women's Champion Jacy Jayne sent the young upstart to the dentist. Other champions might have sent flowers to Grey's resting bed, but Jayne, instead, took to social media to welcome Grey to the lifestyle.\n\n\"Welcome to the biz kid,\" Jayne wrote simply.\n\nMidday Thursday, Jayne reposted and responded to Grey's tooth-related call-out post. In Grey's original post, the WWE EVOLVE Women's Champion posted a clip of the fateful knee to the jaw that sent her to the nearest dentist's office, and tagged Jayne's social media account in her caption. While the extent of Grey's tooth injury is unclear, the \"NXT\" upstart nevertheless promised to return the favor to Jayne in the future, prompting Jayne's snarky response. As of writing, Jayne's remark has surpassed nearly 8,000 views on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWelcome to the biz kid https://t.co/0Lk6AJk0ZF\n\n— Jacy Jayne (@jacyjaynewwe) January 8, 2026\n\nFans were vocal with support under Jayne's post, with a leading comment calling Jayne \"one of the best knee strikers in the game.\" Others praised Jayne for her dominant \"NXT\" run, while several netizens called Jayne \"mother,\" a term of endearment in queer and Gen Z online spaces. Grey has yet to respond to Jayne's comments.\n\nThe strike that sent Grey to the dentist's chair office comes from her \"NXT\" Women's Championship match at Tuesday's New Years Evil event, where she unsuccessfully challenged for Jayne's title in an contest full of vicious strikes, top-rope moves, and Fatal Influence interference. If rumors are true, however, Grey may not have long to score payback on Jayne, as rumors of a main roster call-up for the Fatal Influence leader run rampant.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "At first, the story of last night's \"NXT\" seemed to be Oba Femi notching another successful defense of the NXT Championship after he defeated TNA star Leon Slater. But that changed quickly as Femi wound up leaving the NXT Championship in the middle of the ring, a sign many took to mean that Femi was vacating the championship. While that hasn't been confirmed, Femi strongly hinted towards that himself by taking to X on Wednesday morning to post a photo of the NXT Title in the ring, accompanied by only one word; FIN.\n\nFIN 🪶 pic.twitter.com/cSzASs5QAb\n\n— Oba Femi wwe (@Obaofwwe) January 7, 2026\n\nFemi's actions strongly suggest that the two-time NXT Champion and former NXT North American Champion could be the latest \"NXT\" star to find himself called up to the main roster, following Trick Williams, Jordynne Grace, and Je'Von Evans. Several reports have suggested that WWE is also considering calling up former NXT North American Women's Champion Blake Monroe, speculation that was further fueled by Monroe's match with Thea Hail suddenly being changed during last night's show.\n\nIf Femi is vacating the NXT Championship as believed, it will end his second reign at a mere 32 days, making it the fifth shortest reign in the title's history, trailing only Karrion Kross' 4 day reign, Samoa Joe's 14 and 21 day reigns, and Dolph Ziggler's 27 day reign. It would also be only the fourth time the NXT Championship has been vacated, and the first time it was vacated willingly by the champion, as previous vacancies were forced by injuries to champions Tommaso Ciampa, Karrion Kross, and Samoa Joe.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

Did he?\" Punk said. \"Everybody's an expert.

    "description": "It’s fair to say 2025 wasn’t a particularly vintage year for WWE. But will 2026 be better? Here are some ideas that might help get the ball rolling.",
    "fullText": "It’s fair to say 2025 wasn’t a particularly vintage year for WWE. But will 2026 be better?\n\nIf Triple H and TKO are on the hunt for ideas that might make the product feel a little less stale in the new year, here are a handful that might help get the ball rolling.\n\nRemove the cornerstone that is (was!) John Cena and it’s tough to escape the conclusion that most of WWE’s PLE shows were on autopilot mode in 2025, with a lot of boilerplate matches, predictable conclusions and a lack of juicy rivalries.\n\nMy pet theory is it’s an inadvertent consequence of Triple H’s more sports-like presentation. We’ve seen over and again how the current leadership has opted for a more ESPN-friendly feel, relying on big matches to do the talking. But that has also meant stripping the “entertainment” from Vinnie Mac’s famous “sports entertainment” formula.\n\nYou can see this particularly on the weekly shows. How often do promo segments on “Raw” and “SmackDown” end up as boilerplate trash-talking, where the only question is when the interruption will come? What happened to all that rich backstage drama we used to see during the Bloodline era?\n\nThose narrative scenes didn’t just bring a bit of visual variety to the program, but sometimes turned into great television in their own right. Remember the high drama of the tribal court segment with Sami Zayn, for example?\n\nMaybe actually engage a few scriptwriters every now and then, rather than just leaving the matches to tell the stories.\n\nAnother hallmark of the Triple H era has been the slimmed down match cards. The effect has been more dramatic on the PLEs, but it’s affected the weekly shows too. It’s not uncommon for “Raw” to have four matches over three hours.\n\nQuality over quantity is welcome. But it’s also led to a dearth of opportunities on the mid-card. Secondary belts are rarely defended on the PLEs, and mid-carders who are introduced to great fanfare (Rusev, Aleister Black, Giulia) end up being booked intermittently, making it harder for the live crowds to get behind them.\n\nAdding to the slimmed down mid-card activity is the fact that much of that stuff now takes place in WWE’s partnership promotions instead. Look at the way Legado del Fantasma and the LWO have essentially been seconded to AAA, for example, or the fact that Chelsea Green has been doing her best work alongside Ethan Page across both NXT and TNA.\n\nAs someone who cheered WWE’s new partnerships model, I have to hold my hands up here: I didn't figure it'd lead to some of the emerging talent essentially disappearing from the weekly shows. My bad.\n\nWe don’t always agree on everything at Uncrowned. But one conclusion was pretty unanimous across our wrestling columnists and reviewers in 2025: There were far too many DQ finishes in main events in WWE — particularly on “Raw.”\n\nTo be honest, the problem hasn’t quite gone away. The DQ ratio has dropped since our investigation, admittedly, but we still seem to have too many back-to-back finishes involving members of The Vision or their allies interfering in each other’s matches — usually leading to some kind of group melee involving CM Punk, LA Knight or The Usos.\n\nIn theory, these kinds of scenes are meant to establish The Vision as the bad guys who can throw their weight around as they please. In practice, though, they just feel like the creatives are treading water until the bigger shows come around.\n\nWWE’s success depends on its flagship monthly shows. And after a period of chop and change on that front, it now seems that Triple H has settled on his preferred schedule as to which PLEs we get and when. But has he picked the right ones?\n\nIt’s pretty clear some PLEs are working less well than others. Take WarGames, for example, which often feels contrived given the need to hastily assemble alliances that usually get dropped straight afterward. The women’s WarGames matches tend to feel like they were booked using a Harry Potter sorting hat.\n\nElimination Chamber is another one. It’s a fantastic gimmick match, but the fact that it is always used to decide the remaining WrestleMania main-eventers makes it much more predictable than it used to be. Why not go back to putting titles on the line directly in the cage (the U.S. title, for example) and give it a fresher feel?\n\nI call it the curse of the character relaunch. How many WWE wrestlers have we seen brought back with flashy vignettes and a new mystique, only to see the whole idea dropped within weeks?\n\nWhite the graveyard of failed relaunches goes back a long way (Giovanni Vinci, Giovanni Vinci, Veer Mahan…), the most notorious example of 2025 has to be the whole “Ron Killings” relaunch. Despite making a pretty big splash at the time, it has since been totally retconned from existence.\n\nI get that creatives need to run ideas up the flagpole and see what works. But how is that meant to happen when things get dropped before they’ve even had a chance to make an impact?\n\nA quick question: What exactly was the reasoning for WWE’s Women’s Champion having a non-title match against Michin on a recent “SmackDown”? Don’t get me wrong — I had no problem with the match, per se. But what was the justification for Jade Cargill not putting her title on the line?\n\nWe saw this happen a lot in WWE in 2025. Cargill’s predecessor, Tiffany Stratton, had no fewer than five non-title singles matches on “SmackDown.” It happened on the men’s side too. Standout examples include Cody Rhodes vs. Aleister Black in November, and John Cena vs. R-Truth at Saturday Night’s Main Event back in May.\n\nOn each of these occasions it was never explained exactly why they were non-title matches. Most of the time, the champion ended up winning cleanly anyway, leaving the question as to why it couldn’t have been a standard title match.\n\nIt’s time for a much stricter approach. Non-title matches should be kept for circumstances that justify the exception — champion vs. champion matches, for example — rather than used for the sake of it.\n\nThis one is a personal bugbear, and a much smaller one. But hey, if you can’t use these moments to settle a few scores, when can you do it?\n\nCan 2026 be the year that wrestling crowds finally stop with the cursing chants? We get it: People think it’s fun to chant “f*** you, Gunther” or the like. The problem is WWE’s televised shows are still a PG product and it just ends up with the production team censoring the audio in a way that makes the shows much less fun to watch.\n\nWould it really be so bothersome just to not swear in the first place? I know, I know — I’m shouting into the wind here. After all, this is the same fan base that insists on doing the “What?!” chant after every second promo.",

Even before the victory, Dupri had already come a long way in WWE, from the manager of the Maxximum Male Models, to an actual in-ring competitor who is working hard to hone her craft. Dupri recently sat down with \"The Wrestling Classic\" and spoke about her evolution from fans booing her work during a live event to the point the locker room had to rally around her, to becoming champion.\n\n\"Thank you to my haters,\" she said. \"Truthfully, that live event, specifically, that didn't affect me personally. In the moment... When you're new to this and you're wrestling, I can't hear anything. I'm trying to make sure that I just survive this match and do the best I can do.\"\n\nDupri explained she did, however, have a hard time with hate she was getting on social media. She described it as a lesson she needed to learn and said people are entitled to their opinions, and she's entitled to protecting her peace.\n\n\"I have my people that give me my criticism and I know the things that I truly do need to work on that I'm falling short in, and I will always hold myself accountable for that and put my nose down and keep grinding,\" Dupri said. \"It was very challenging for a period of time, but there's pros and cons to everything and that's just part of this job.\"\n\nFans have been witness to a variety of video vignettes on \"Raw\" following her Women's Intercontinental Championship victory, showing Dupri working out in the Dudgeon alongside Natalya's \"Low Key Legend\" character, Nattie. Dupri said that Natalya, and her husband, former WWE star-turned-producer TJ Wilson, have single handedly changed the direction of her career thanks to their training.\n\n\"I think so much of this last year and everyone saying, 'Oh, Maxxine's improved a lot and we're seeing this new side.' It's truly what we do in the Dudgeon,\" she explained. \"Nattie says [it's] finding my 'FU.' It's the way that they push me to my limits in there... Pressure makes diamonds. They have to break you to make you and that is what happens in the Dudgeon.\"\n\nDupri said that the things she's learning in the Dudgeon are applicable to what she needs to be doing to remain on top of things in her matches to be able to stay on the offensive, as well as to reverse certain moves. She credited her training for her victory in her recent match against Ivy Nile. Dupri is set to square off with Lynch for the Women's IC title once again on the first \"Raw\" of 2026.\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit \"The Wrestling Classic\" and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s coverage of the December 26 episode of \"WWE SmackDown,\" where Drew McIntyre, Joe Hendry, and WWE's best will war to end 2025!",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s coverage of the final \"WWE SmackDown\" of 2025, coming to you from the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan this December 26 evening! Heat up your Christmas leftovers, put on your new pair of cozy pajamas, and get ready for an action-packed card to play this spectacular year out.\n\nDrew McIntyre has had a less than jolly season after WWE Universal Champion Cody Rhodes invaded his home mere days before last week's December 19 episode of \"SmackDown.\" While McIntyre was absent from WWE programming following the home break-in and subsequent brawl, \"The Scottish Psychopath\" is back with a vengeance. With the lines between in-ring competition and out-of-ring animosity now blurred beyond recognition, just what will McIntyre do in order to get his revenge against Rhodes in this rivalry-turned-blood feud?\n\nSpeaking of feuds, The Miz is out to reclaim his honor after receiving a Ten-Knuckle Shuffle at \"Saturday Night's Main Event,\" courtesy of R-Truth and Joe Hendry! Grand Rapids will be chanting the name of the former TNA World Champion as he appears to take on the former WWE world titleholder in singles action. While this is looking to be a typical one-on-one affair, The Miz is notorious for bending the rules in order to come out with a win. Will the new-age Hendry be able to withstand the veteran Miz's underhanded tactics, or will Hendry's viral moments crumble under The Miz's tried-and-true tenacity?\n\nIn the vein of tried-and-true tenacity, United States Champion Ilja Dragunov is set to defend his title in yet another installation of his Open Challenge series. So far, he has defended his title against the likes of Tommaso Ciampa, J.D. McDonagh, both halves of Fraxiom, Carmelo Hayes, and others. Dragunov has mostly been able to steer clear of controversy and repeat challengers during his time as United States Champion, but recently defeated challengers Ciampa, Johnny Gargano, and Candace LeRae may not be done with him just yet. Who can Dragunov rely on to even the numbers, or will \"The Mad Dragon\" be faced with the impossible-to-win numbers game to end 2025?\n\nAll will be revealed when WWE's blue brand comes to life tonight, at 8PM Eastern, 7PM Central!\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

Despite this, Jayne is also excited to move up to WWE's main roster.\n\n\"I trust that when the timing is right, it'll happen,\" Jayne said during an interview on \"Sport's Illustrated's The Takedown.\" \"People that I want to work? I want to work everybody!\" The champion then explained that she's practically wrestled everyone in NXT already, and she's eager to broaden her horizons with more opponents. \"I would love to get in the ring with Bayley, Charlotte [Flair], you know I worked Bianca Belair in a tag match, I'd love to work her in a singles match. I think me and Liv Morgan would have a really good match; I think we have very similar styles.\" Jayne also expressed that she wants to take the main roster by storm when she gets there.\n\n\"I'd love to get to the main roster; I feel like that's not really in my hands, that's the higher-ups' decision,\" she also admitted. \"But I do believe when they think I'm ready, the time will come. Again, it's like trusting the process, it never happens when you want it to happen.\" Jayne pointed out that she wanted to be on the main roster two years ago, but realizes that she wasn't ready yet, suggesting that she's content with the decision-making above her.\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit \"Sports Illustrated\" and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

However, they have a hell of a schedule coming up. They got Green Bay and San Francisco, then finished with Detroit,\" said Rollins, \"So for one night only, I will be a Minnesota Vikings fan. Don't tell anybody from Detroit. But yeah, I'm going to be rooting for the Vikings. I'm probably going to need them to take the Lions down a peg so that the Bears can lock in and get it done.

McCarthy and what he looks like in Kevin O'Connell's offense as he goes through sort of what his rookie year is. Obviously, he missed last season with the injury, but it's kind of his first go-around,\" said Rollins, \"Which Lions are we going to get? Lions from last year that dominated and maybe made an early playoff exit, or are we going to get a Lions team that misses the playoffs this season? It's going to be very interesting to see. Looking forward to the matchup, and yeah, I will be saying 'Skol' all afternoon.\"\n\nNetflix's inaugural NFL Christmas games in 2024 smashed streaming records, with the Chiefs vs. Steelers game averaging over 24 million U.S. viewers and reaching nearly 65 million unique viewers across the doubleheader, making it the most-streamed NFL games ever on the platform.\n\nRollins will star in WWE Unreal Season 2, premiering on January 20, 2026: https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-unreal-season-2-release-date-trailer-news.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: WWE Superstar Seth Rollins discusses Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

    "fullText": "After two major wins this year, GUNTHER now has the unique distinction of retiring John Cena and Goldberg, both of whom are considered legends within WWE. Outside of their high-profile status in WWE, though, \"The Ring General\" indicates that Cena and Goldberg vastly differ. During a new interview with TMZ's \"Inside The Ring,\" he explained how.\n\n\"Very different situation I think because Goldberg was also way more limited than John was. John was just a better wrestler over all his whole career. It's not like it dig to Goldberg. He didn't get famous by putting on in-ring master classes. That was never his thing, so it was a very different situation,\" GUNTHER said when asked to contrast his encounters with Cena and Goldberg.\n\n\"Also the magnitude of it. Obviously, Goldberg is a big name, but it's not comparable to what John Cena represents or the following he has, what he carries with him, and the connection that people have to him. It was hard to compare.\"\n\nGUNTHER's faceoff with Goldberg came at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event on July 12, which ended with the latter passing out to the former's sleeper hold. At SNME on December 13, GUNTHER again emerged victorious with his sleeper hold, this time by making Cena, a conduit of perseverance, tap out.\n\nFollowing their retirement matches, Goldberg and Cena have officially hung up their wrestling boots, or sneakers in Cena's case, at the ages of 58 and 48, respectively. Cena remains a part of the WWE family through his role as an ambassador.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Inside The Ring\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

There was a moment where it could've happened, but then that moment went away because of certain circumstances. And so, it never came back.\"\n\nAdd the exclusion of Miz from Cena's last chapter as another questionable decision from WWE creative in their handling of Cena's retirement run.\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit the \"SI Media\" podcast and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Stephanie Vaquer is still Women's World Champion, but she won her \"WWE Raw\" match against Judgment Day's Raquel Rodriguez by interference when WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella came through the crowd and caused a disqualification. Rodriguez had established herself as number one contender to Vaquer's title last week, when she took out Bella as she was attempting to demand her rematch after her loss to Vaquer at Survivor Series.\n\nRodriguez tried to overpower Vaquer to start off their match, and she got a lot of offense in throughout the bout. Vaquer went to the top rope to hit a flying cross body, but her challenger caught her and slammed her to the canvas. The champion tried to get Rodriguez in an armbar around the ropes, but before the referee could even begin a five count, Rodriguez had Vaquer up and hit a power bomb.\n\nVaquer hit the Devil's Kiss in the middle of the ring, causing Rodriguez to retreat to the corner where Vaquer hit her with a meteora. She tried to get Rodriguez up for the SVB, but couldn't. On the outside of the ring, Rodriguez caught a second Vaquer cross body and looked to throw her into the ring post, but Vaquer countered and sent Rodriguez face-first into the post.\n\nIt was then that Bella came out of the crowd to attack Vaquer. She connected with the Rack Attack 2.0 in the ring and later in a backstage segment, Bella said she demanded respect as a legend in the business from the other women.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

In addition to multiple appearances on \"WWE Raw\" Nikki has competed at several Premium Live Events, but her recent run has seemingly led her sister, Brie Bella, to consider stepping back inside the squared circle as well. Last month, The Bella Twins turned 42-years-old, and while discussing their birthday wishes on their podcast, Brie shared that she's been hoping to join her sister for one last ride with WWE.\n\n\"I think there is definitely a last run in me, and I'm at the age and I'm strong and I think it's cause I'm working out so hard and I'm feeling good. But I'm like, there's for sure a last run in me,\" she explained on \"The Nikki & Brie Show.\" \"Wherever it may take me, wherever it may be, I hope it's with you. Wherever that is at, who knows, whether it's for one night or 200 nights. We'll see.\"\n\nAs for Nikki, she wished that she will become the Women's World Champion in the near future, but together both sisters hope they can have the opportunity to win the Women's Tag Team Championships before they retire. Nikki recently challenged for the world championship at Survivor Series when she went one-on-one with Stephanie Vaquer for the title, but she was defeated by the \"Dark Angel\" after 12 minutes of in-ring action.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"The Nikki & Brie Show\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Just three months into his farewell tour this year, John Cena captured his 17th world title when he defeated Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41, officially surpassing Ric Flair's long-standing record of 16 world championships. Cena originally tied Flair in 2017 when he finally scored a victory over AJ Styles, but for years fans questioned if WWE would allow the 48-year-old to become the sole holder of the milestone. However, Cena himself was unsure about beating Flair's record, as he outlined his respect for \"The Nature Boy\" during in an interview on \"Insight,\" and hopes to one day congratulate the performer that wins 18 world titles.\n\n\"I have been apprehensive for quite some time for that because I love Ric. Super mentor to me. Always been a great guy to me and I love him. I meant what I said in the press conference at Rumble ... I want to win 17 so I can shake the hand of the performer that wins 18. So what it meant to me personally was like, hey youngins, one of them is going to be you or you better get working because I don't want to be in the ground when 18 happens. I want to shake somebody's hand and something that's impossible is now possible. So that's what it means to me of hopefully by my actions, this is possible, and holy hell this guy wants to shake my hand when I pass it and I can't wait to do that.\"\n\nCena's Undisputed WWE Championship reign would last 105 days before he was dethroned by Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam this past August. Cena never received an opportunity to win back the gold, and instead set his sights on the Intercontinental Title, where he would defeat Dominik Mysterio and officially become a Grand Slam Champion.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

However, the card inside the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, will also include a few other notable matchups.\n\nWWE champion Cody Rhodes will face his NXT counterpart Oba Femi. Women’s division legend Bayley will take on star prospect Sol Ruca, and the current World Tag Team champs, AJ Styles and Dragon Lee, will face NXT’s Je’Von Evans and TNA X-Division title holder Leon Slater.\n\nBelow you can find all the night’s results and the best highlights from each match.\n\nRhodes and Femi delivered an entertaining match, and one of the biggest takeaways was how over the NXT star is that the crowd was split for this one. Unfortunately, after a good start to the show, it ended in disqualification due to interference from Drew McIntyre.

    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the iconic career of WWE legend John Cena will get a ceremonious end. His match with Gunther will conclude a year-long retirement tour where he took part in many entertaining matchups. However, during the tour and throughout his career, there were several dream matchups that wrestling fans missed out on.\n\nWith his career officially over, we look at six matches wrestling fans never got during John Cena’s incomparable career.\n\nDespite being on the roster together during both of Drew McIntyre’s two stints in WWE, he never faced Cena. He was also a popular pick to get a match with the legend during his 2025 tour. Yet, the stars never aligned, and the future Hall of Famer never got to face the current and best version of the “Scottish Psycho.”\n\nLA Knight nearly got his opportunity to face Cena, but came up just short to Gunther in the “Last Time is Now Tournament” final. It would have made sense for Knight to face Cena and win as a passing of the torch moment. The former United States champion would have also been a good opponent option during Cena’s short heel run. Alas, it never happened.\n\nCena wasn’t a star during Bill Goldberg’s first run in WWE, but he was an icon when he made his surprise return in the late 2010s. A dream match between them at WrestleMania could have been epic as the two powerhouses and wrestling greats went toe-to-toe in a match few would have expected. Yet, the company chose to have the former WCW champion focus on a long feud with Brock Lesnar instead of a matchup with John Cena.\n\nJey Uso eliminated John Cena in this year’s Royal Rumble. There were rumblings about a match between the two after that, but it never happened. A clash between the two would have been a lot of fun since they are two of the most beloved characters in WWE right now. Instead, Uso was busy in the World Heavyweight title picture for much of 2025.\n\nTo many wrestling fans, Japanese icon Kazuchika Okada is seen as NJPW’s version of Cena. That is why the two facing off is a unique dream match some fans hoped to see. However, when Okada chose to sign with AEW in March of last year, it killed any chance of that matchup ever happening.\n\nRic Flair has faced many elite stars from multiple generations. However, John Cena was not one of the. The idea of the long-time leader for most world title reigns facing the man who would eventually beat his record could have been interesting, but they never went toe-to-toe in that short period during the end of Flair’s run as an active competitor in WWE.\n\nShane McMahon, surprisingly, got to face many WWE legends during his part-time run wrestling in his father’s company. Yet, despite getting huge matchups with all-time greats like The Undertaker, Steve Austin, and The Rock, McMahon never got a one-on-one match with Cena. The bout probably would have been a lot of fun, especially the build-up to the unexpected bout.\n\nSaturday Night’s Main Event Results: Highlights From John Cena Retirement Match & Grades\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden\n\nMLB Free Agency Predictions: Projecting Landing Spots for Top 5 MLB Free Agents Right Now",

    "fullText": "As a worldwide phenomenon, professional wrestling has long attracted performers with diverse backgrounds. In the case of Becky Lynch, her roots were initially anchored in Ireland, but later expanded to countries such as Canada, Japan, and the United States. Whatever one's history may be, though, Lynch believes all wrestlers likely have at least one specific thing in common.\n\n\"I was just going [to training] so that I would be less of a delinquent,' Lynch recalled on \"First We Feast.\" \"[It was just] to organize my life and get my act together, and it did. I started doing better at school. I started training. It changed everything. It changed everything in my life, but it wasn't for the goal of becoming a professional wrestler. I found a community that I loved. I found that if I worked hard at something, I could get better at it. And I was never good at anything. There's something about wrestlers, maybe there's like a little screw loose, I don't know, but there is something that bonds us all together.\n\n\"You meet so many different people from different walks of life,\" she continued. \"We were all like co-mingling and having a great time and having the banter and having the crack and having the fun. Crack means fun; we weren't doing drugs.\"\n\nAccording to Lynch, her connection to wrestling extends back to early childhood, when she and her brother watched it together on television. After they took a break from it, the siblings returned to wrestling during WWE's Attitude Era, with Lynch especially drawn to the passionate promos of Mick Foley.

    "description": "The man behind the \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase will fight for the final time on Saturday night. But who is he, really?",
    "fullText": "The Last Time Is Now. It's the name given to the tournament in which 16 wrestling giants have been competing to be the one opponent in John Cena's final fight before retirement.\n\nAnd that final fight is now - Saturday night - in Washington DC, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career that has seen the American become one of wrestling's biggest and most bankable stars.\n\nIn the 8,570 days since his debut, Cena has clinched 17 world titles and coined the iconic \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase - but the 48-year-old's impact goes far beyond that.\n\nIf you were to pose the question \"who is John Cena?\", depending on who you ask, the answers might vary from legendary WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) superstar, to successful film actor, while some will say he's Mr Make-A-Wish (more on that later).\n\nHow to watch John Cena's last match:\n\nStart time: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event is scheduled to begin at 01:00 GMT on Sun 14 Dec\n\nWhere to watch: In the UK, you can watch for free on WWE's official YouTube channel. Internationally it can be watched on Netflix, and on Peacock in the US\n\nSince his 2002 debut, there's been an evolution in his own wrestling character - transitioning from \"ruthless aggression\" rookie, to a \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" rapper, and eventually a heroic character known for a \"Never Give Up\" attitude.\n\nDespite criticism from some fans of his in-ring ability, with occasional chants of \"you can't wrestle\" through the years, \"there's no doubt that he's an exceptional wrestling talent\", says Brandon Thurston, editor and owner of wrestling website, Wrestlenomics.\n\nHe feels something changed in 2005, after which WWE became \"increasingly scripted in a way it had not been\" before, as it entered into a more controlled, family friendly PG era. But Cena managed thrive.\n\n\"He's definitely been the biggest draw over the time which I would say stretches from 2005 to roughly 2015,\" Mr Thurston says, with Cena's merchandise also regularly topping sales for the company.\n\n\"There's little question that he was WWE's most important economic wrestler throughout that time - in terms of pay-per-view buys, which were still central in that era, TV ratings, and as a house show draw.\"\n\nOutside the ring too, he's a personality who \"people gravitate towards and want to listen to\", says Mr Thurston - and wrestling fans like Joe Clarkson and Sabrina Nicole feel just that.\n\n\"To go for such a long time in an industry, which is quite heavily taxing on the body, is absolutely fascinating,\" says Joe, 24, who was five when he first saw Cena on TV.\n\n\"I think over time, the people just gained more and more respect for him, not just as a performer, but also as an individual.\"\n\nFor Sabrina, 37, who remembers Cena's WWE debut in 2002, it's \"his charisma\".\n\n\"He has just always had something about him that makes him a star,\" she says, adding that for most of his career, he's \"always maintained a good guy persona\".\n\n\"No matter what the crowd, no matter what the fans have thought of him. He has just been the testament to if you have a really good character, you can be on top,\" she says.\n\nIt also seems to be true that, beyond his ability and persona, Cena seized an opportunity.\n\nWith The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin no longer full-time performers, WWE bosses were looking for a new star to emerge.\n\nBrandon feels WWE leadership recognised Cena \"would be a very reliable and extremely hardworking person whom they could entrust with such a spot\".\n\nIt's widely accepted within wrestling circles that the final decision to have Cena as the chosen star would ultimately have been taken by then-WWE chairman Vince McMahon.\n\nWhile he was known for following his instincts, there will also have been a judgement on Cena's ability to connect with a passionate crowd on the mic, his marketability and whether he could be in the industry long enough to be profitable.\n\nAnd when Cena started taking more time away from wrestling in 2015 and working a reduced schedule, Mr Thurston feels there was a \"decline\" in the WWE product.\n\nOther wrestling experts have suggested Cena's presence over the years helped slow the slide of WWE ratings trending downwards which, according to analysis by wrestling site PWtorch, saw average viewership for its flagship weekly Raw programme fall by a million between 2010 and 2015, to 3.7m.\n\nHaving achieved so much within wrestling, Cena could \"just come in and be a wrestler and walk out\", adds Dr Gillian Brooks, associate professor in marketing at King's Business School, but instead she says he built a personal brand that comes across as real.\n\nAmong the brands Cena has worked with is Neutrogena, becoming the face of its sunscreen campaign after revealing he had skin cancer spots - which he attributed to his own lack of sun protection use.\n\nHe also holds the Guinness World Record for the number of wishes granted through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with more than 650 fulfilled wishes for children with critical illnesses. It's a partnership he revealed had started by \"accident\", but one he's kept since 2002, describing it as \"the coolest thing\".\n\n\"If you think about it from a child's perspective, they're seeing someone that they've seen on TV watching WWE or in films, and they suddenly get to meet him,\" Dr Brooks says. \"The fact that he's doing charity work, he's written a children's book, been in films, made music… all these things illustrate that he's not a one show pony.\n\n\"It's coming across in a way that's very authentic and very sort of pure to who he is.\"\n\nBoth Cena's personal brand and his charisma are set to live on, but his time in the ring looks to have come to an end after Cena announced last year that 2025 would be his last as a competitor.\n\nExplaining his reasoning at the time, he told of the physical toll wrestling had taken on his body.\n\nHis career has seen him undergo several operations, including on his neck, pec and triceps, with Cena saying in interviews that his \"body hurts\" and is \"screaming to close the chapter\".\n\nWhile the old saying \"never say never\" is a popular one, Cena has repeatedly said he will be \"100% done\" - and has received rousing receptions around the world for his final appearances.\n\nOverall, fan Joe is happy with Cena's \"retirement run\", with matches against old rivals such as AJ Styles, Randy Orton and CM Punk, and newer stars including Dominik Mysterio and Gunther.\n\nHe does feel the \"execution\" of his final year could have been better though, with Cena's short-term \"heel turn\" (becoming a villain) at the Elimination Chamber event in March drawing criticism.\n\n\"It could have been handled better,\" Joe says. \"[But] he's had such a unique distinction of having a retirement run that no one's ever had before.\n\n\"It's very sad to see him retire now. But I think he said it himself - it's the right time.\"\n\nNot that WWE fans will never see Cena again; he has signed a five-year deal to be an ambassador for the company.\n\nHaving won The Last Time Is Now tournament, it's former world heavyweight champion Gunther who will face Cena in his final fight.\n\nWith it not being broadcast on terrestrial TV, but rather on streaming platforms, it's been reported that there is no time limit on the match - and Gunther, who has never wrestled Cena before, has been giving much tough talk.\n\nOne thing's for sure: \"You Can't See Me\" might be the taunt Cena gives Gunther, but the last fight will be seen and remembered by many.\n\nGrand Theft Auto made him a legend. His latest game was a disaster\n\nSo bad they're good - why do we love terrible films?\n\nWhy Indiana Jones, Barbie and other US films were shot in UK",

    "title": "The 3 faces of John Cena: How WWE's franchise player became bigger than wrestling",
    "description": "When looking at John Cena’s legacy, it boils down to a trio of personas that embodied the superstar who defined a generation.",
    "fullText": "How do you effectively sum up the career of a legend?\n\nHow do you take a quarter-century worth of accomplishments, championships and memories and boil them down into something easily digestible, yet appropriately meaningful at the same time?\n\nHow do you quantify a once-in-a-generation run in a realm that doesn’t track bumps taken, finishers hit or smiles delivered?\n\nIn an industry as unquantifiable as professional wrestling, you swerve everyone, and look at the numbers.\n\nThere’s the biggest one, 17, representing the record number of world championships won. There’s 26, the number of years wrestled when all is said and done. There’s 1,554, the tally of matches to this point in the career. There’s 100, the number of victories at premium live events — when the lights are brightest.\n\nAll of those are great, but they fail to encapsulate John Cena, who, on Saturday, will wrestle for the final time in a WWE ring. For Cena, the number that should exemplify his legacy is three.\n\nThere’s an intended irony in describing a retiring pro wrestler’s career with the number three, as it represents a finality in the ring, but when looking at Cena’s legacy, it boils down to a trio of personas that embodied the superstar who defined a generation.\n\nFrom an in-ring perspective, Cena’s style worked incredibly well for what it was.\n\nNever a high-flyer or traditional worker — there’s a reason it took until his final months for Cena to capture the WWE Intercontinental Championship, known as the worker’s title — the early portions of Cena’s career became defined by a power-based attack and a moveset that came to be known as the “Five Moves of Doom,” which would usually be unleashed after taking a beating from his opponent and ultimately result in a win. The rinse-and-repeat formula earned him the nickname “Super Cena” from fans who were disenfranchised with the repetitive nature of his matches.\n\nStill, there were many high points that proved these criticisms of Cena to be largely unfounded and subjective.\n\nDuring the late 2000s, Cena’s rivalries with Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton and Edge produced classics that still hold up today. His return at the 2008 Royal Rumble is among the biggest in the history of the event. Cena headlined six WrestleManias, including three consecutive from 2011 to 2013, wrestling a pair of underrated matches against Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in a proverbial passing-of-the-torch moment. His 2011 Money in the Bank championship match against CM Punk still stands out as one of the best of his career and helped cement Punk’s status as a legend in WWE.\n\nCena’s style was what fit for himself and WWE at the time. It was part of what made him such an excellent contrast with the likes of Michaels, Edge, Punk and, later in his career, AJ Styles, all of whom had higher in-ring work rates. He also had seemingly limitless strength, lifting Big Show, Mark Henry and, at times, multiple wrestlers onto his shoulders for his Attitude Adjustment finisher.\n\nThe arrival of Styles helped Cena shed any perceived slights about his in-ring ability. Cena and Styles met for the first time on a WWE PLE at Money in the Bank in 2016, but their best match of that initial run came at SummerSlam that same year. It was an instant classic, showcasing the contrasting styles of both men and seemingly unlocking something in Cena as the quality of his matches quickly began to outweigh the sheer quantity of them.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Cena also quelled misconceptions about burying talent. Alongside the “Super Cena” critiques came the notion that his star shined at the expense of younger talent. While it’s not an uncommon criticism at the top of the card in professional wrestling, in Cena's case, he played a pivotal role in introducing the Nexus and elevating the United States Championship, with his open challenge serving as the main roster introductions for the likes of Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn.\n\nThis final run as an in-ring performer has been among Cena’s best — again, quality over quantity.\n\nCena’s shown a mastery of ring psychology, an expanded moveset and the same Herculean power that made him one of the greatest of all time. Renewed rivalries with Orton and Punk have hit every note of nostalgia you would expect. His final match with Cody Rhodes provided both another five-star effort and his own passing-of-the-torch moment, 12 years after WrestleMania 29. His reunion with AJ Styles was a swan song for two icons that will not be matched any time soon. Perhaps the most telling thing about Cena's entire run is that, despite what he has said in interviews about this final year, he never appeared to slow down in the ring.\n\nIn many ways, Cena probably shouldn’t have been as successful as he has been. After bursting onto the scene in 2001 more as “The Prototype” than “John Cena,” it took the Massachusetts native some time to find his footing in WWE.\n\nUltimately, Cena’s charisma and talent as an entertainer won out, leading to his freestyle-rapping, jersey-wearing “Doctor of Thuganomics” character. What feels dated in 2025 worked immensely for Cena 20 years ago, connecting him with the crowd in a way that would only enhance and evolve at seemingly every turn for the next two decades.\n\nCena faced two major transitional hurdles in his career, particularly as he moved up the card in WWE.\n\nFirst, with Stone Cold Steve Austin retired and The Rock focused on Hollywood, there was a void as WWE moved from the beloved “Attitude Era” around 2002 into what is now looked back on as the “Ruthless Aggression Era.” Cena — and fellow OVW standouts Batista, Brock Lesnar and Orton — helped bridge the gap, even with legends like The Undertaker, Michaels and Triple H still occupying main-event slots, but none reached the heights that Cena did.\n\nThe second challenge ran parallel to the first. While violence and sex appeal helped WWE win the Monday Night Wars, the company was set to move into a more family-friendly direction by the summer of 2008: The “PG Era.”\n\nCena, after rising to fame as the “Doctor of Thuganomics,” essentially scrubbed his character, trading the throwback jerseys for brightly colored WWE-branded merch, renaming his signature move from its original moniker — the F-U — and weaving in themes of patriotism and military after starring in “The Marine.” While the trademark intensity was still there, the message and tone shifted in a way that matched the direction WWE wanted to go and cemented Cena as the purest babyface character of the past quarter century.\n\nThroughout all of it, Cena’s ability to connect with an audience and deliver meaningful promos never wavered. There was merchandise, catchphrases, a rap album — including his own now-timeless theme — movies, commercials and plenty more that all played a role in building Cena up into one of the most impactful entertainers in pro-wrestling history.\n\nAs Cena’s career progressed, particularly as he shifted from full-time WWE superstar to dipping his foot into the Hollywood pond, a new authenticity came when he picked up the microphone in the ring. Rather than sticking strictly to kayfabe, Cena consistently broke the fourth wall in a way that elevated his segments, while also serving as a wink and a nod to a professional wrestling culture that was increasingly online and connected to behind-the-scenes happenings.\n\nEven during his retirement tour, Cena showed new depth as an entertainer. Say what you will about his overall 2025 heel run, Cena strung us along in the early part of the year and the turn itself was arguably as stunning as we’ve seen since July 7, 1996. Then, when it was time to turn again, Cena flipped the switch and it was back to business.\n\nThe final pillar of Cena’s legacy is perhaps the most important. Beyond the 17 world championships or the millions of dollars in merchandise and tickets sold stands Cena’s role as an ambassador for WWE.\n\nFor 20 years, Cena served as a reliable spokesperson for WWE, capable of presenting the very best the company had to offer with a squeaky-clean image and charisma for days.\n\nWWE needed to promote an event? Send Cena to Kimmel or Conan.\n\nNickelodeon needs a host for the Kid’s Choice Awards? Call Cena.\n\nFor a billion-dollar company, Cena was the QB1 of QB1s when it came to public relations, but it stretched beyond that.\n\nCena has worked extensively with Make-A-Wish throughout his career, granting more than 650 wishes for sick children and their families as the current Guinness World Record holder for the foundation. As much as the IWC will debate star ratings or get into tribal feuds over promotions, Cena’s generosity and kind heart are an undeniable measure of his greatness not just as a performer, but as a human being.\n\nCena embraced his role as a real-life superhero for millions of kids, offering up just a few minutes of his time to brighten up the lives of those who needed it most.\n\nHaving examined the elements that made Cena who he is today, we have to ask how do you sum it all up?\n\nHave there been and will there be better wrestlers than Cena? Yes.\n\nHave there been and will there be better entertainers than Cena? Yes, but there’s so much subjectivity involved that it’s very much up for debate.\n\nHave there been or will there be better ambassadors than Cena? Almost certainly not.\n\nIn a world built on kayfabe, Cena brought an authenticity that overcame industry-wide shifts, thriving across multiple decades, showcasing longevity that lasted from flip phones to FaceTime.\n\nIn a landscape that begs for change — in character or company — Cena embodied his motto, “hustle, loyalty, respect\" better than maybe anyone ever, and when he did turn, the wrestling world collectively said “no thanks, we like it better the old way.”\n\nWith the last time finally being now, it’s all clear:\n\nWe won’t see another John Cena again.",

    "description": "AEW star Bryan Danielson explains why he wasn't bothered by his WWE WrestleMania 28 loss, which saw him get beaten by Sheamus in eighteen seconds",
    "fullText": "It's hard to believe that the moment that arguably kickstarted Bryan Danielson to WWE, and later AEW superstardom, wasn't when he won the Undisputed Championship at WrestleMania 30, but was a moment that left fans in the uproar. Indeed, Danielson's success story can be traced back to a WrestleMania 28 match with Sheamus, where the latter defeated Danielson to win the World Heavyweight Championship in 18 seconds. It was a booking decision seemingly made to get Sheamus over, only it instead rallied the fans around the heel Danielson, leading to a groundswell of support that has arguably continued to this day.\n\nAppearing on \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet,\" Danielson reminisced on the moment, even sharing a funny interaction with a co-worker backstage after the loss. He also explained why the months that followed led to him not being all that upset with how things turned out.\n\n\"When they had Sheamus beat me in 18 seconds at WrestleMania...28 maybe...the fans were just 'Yesing!' like crazy when I went out there,\" Danielson said. \"You could tell they were bummed when the match was so short. Then I walked to the back and The Great Khali of all people was like 'That was f*****g b******t!' And I was like 'Oh! Khali, I didn't know you cared. Thank you!' But then, like, the next night I was like 'Okay, well, there's a lot of people 'Yesing!'' But it just kept going. That was kind of...when after a couple of months after that, and it was still happening, I was like 'Okay. This is going to be here for a bit.'\"\n\nEven if it hadn't worked out that way, Danielson still seemed to indicate that the loss wouldn't have bothered him too much. Though he admitted that he was confused by WWE's decision at the time, he also admitted he didn't fight the decision, partially because it wasn't in his nature to begin with, and also because he feels that isn't the best course. He then pointed to an AEW star and former rival of his as an example of how to handle situations like that.\n\n\"I've never been somebody who's like 'Wait a second, why would you beat me in 18 seconds?'\" Danielson said. \"Or 'Why would you just beat me with one move?' or whatever. I was like 'Okay, that's the creative direction. I'm going to do the best I can with it.' I find that a lot of people put up stinks about a lot of things, whatever it is...You could put up a little resistance if you really don't like something.\n\n\"But then if this is what the boss wants, you're better off to do your absolute best at what the boss wants, and then try to get over from that. I think a great example in AEW is Swerve Strickland. He came in and he lost a lot of matches. But it was always 'Yes sir Tony. Whatever you need, I'll go out there and do.' And now look at him. He's main evented PPV's. He's a World Champion. He's fantastic.\"\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet\" and provide an h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Ricky Saints cost Je'Von Evans the NXT Championship in his challenge against Oba Femi in the main event of \"WWE NXT.\"\n\nEvans interrupted Saints earlier in the show as the former champion sought a rematch for the title he had lost at Deadline. And given that Evans was the Iron Survivor coming out of the same event, he made the case that he should get the next opportunity at the title and didn't want to wait for New Year's Evil. Saints originally pushed back on the idea, but Evans appeared to talk him down and he stepped aside for Evans to challenge Femi in the main event.\n\nThe challenger went on to endure everything the champion could throw at him, getting the better of things on the outside of the ring before returning and seeming to have the match under wraps. He connected with his springboard cutter and went for what looked like the winning cover, only for the referee to be yanked from the ring before the three-count could be made.\n\nEvans turned to realize that it was Saints that had cost him, with them staring one another down as Femi got back to his feet. He clattered his challenger with a lariat, delivering the finishing powerbomb for the winning pinfall.\n\nAfter the match, Femi walked off with his title, confirming that it will be him going into this weekend's Saturday Night's Main Event against WWE Champion, Cody Rhodes. He gave a disapproving look to Saints, who simply shrugged it off and continued to smile at Evans defeated in the ring as the show went off air.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.
