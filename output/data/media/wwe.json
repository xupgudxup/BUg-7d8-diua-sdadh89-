    "description": "It’s fair to say 2025 wasn’t a particularly vintage year for WWE. But will 2026 be better? Here are some ideas that might help get the ball rolling.",
    "fullText": "It’s fair to say 2025 wasn’t a particularly vintage year for WWE. But will 2026 be better?\n\nIf Triple H and TKO are on the hunt for ideas that might make the product feel a little less stale in the new year, here are a handful that might help get the ball rolling.\n\nRemove the cornerstone that is (was!) John Cena and it’s tough to escape the conclusion that most of WWE’s PLE shows were on autopilot mode in 2025, with a lot of boilerplate matches, predictable conclusions and a lack of juicy rivalries.\n\nMy pet theory is it’s an inadvertent consequence of Triple H’s more sports-like presentation. We’ve seen over and again how the current leadership has opted for a more ESPN-friendly feel, relying on big matches to do the talking. But that has also meant stripping the “entertainment” from Vinnie Mac’s famous “sports entertainment” formula.\n\nYou can see this particularly on the weekly shows. How often do promo segments on “Raw” and “SmackDown” end up as boilerplate trash-talking, where the only question is when the interruption will come? What happened to all that rich backstage drama we used to see during the Bloodline era?\n\nThose narrative scenes didn’t just bring a bit of visual variety to the program, but sometimes turned into great television in their own right. Remember the high drama of the tribal court segment with Sami Zayn, for example?\n\nMaybe actually engage a few scriptwriters every now and then, rather than just leaving the matches to tell the stories.\n\nAnother hallmark of the Triple H era has been the slimmed down match cards. The effect has been more dramatic on the PLEs, but it’s affected the weekly shows too. It’s not uncommon for “Raw” to have four matches over three hours.\n\nQuality over quantity is welcome. But it’s also led to a dearth of opportunities on the mid-card. Secondary belts are rarely defended on the PLEs, and mid-carders who are introduced to great fanfare (Rusev, Aleister Black, Giulia) end up being booked intermittently, making it harder for the live crowds to get behind them.\n\nAdding to the slimmed down mid-card activity is the fact that much of that stuff now takes place in WWE’s partnership promotions instead. Look at the way Legado del Fantasma and the LWO have essentially been seconded to AAA, for example, or the fact that Chelsea Green has been doing her best work alongside Ethan Page across both NXT and TNA.\n\nAs someone who cheered WWE’s new partnerships model, I have to hold my hands up here: I didn't figure it'd lead to some of the emerging talent essentially disappearing from the weekly shows. My bad.\n\nWe don’t always agree on everything at Uncrowned. But one conclusion was pretty unanimous across our wrestling columnists and reviewers in 2025: There were far too many DQ finishes in main events in WWE — particularly on “Raw.”\n\nTo be honest, the problem hasn’t quite gone away. The DQ ratio has dropped since our investigation, admittedly, but we still seem to have too many back-to-back finishes involving members of The Vision or their allies interfering in each other’s matches — usually leading to some kind of group melee involving CM Punk, LA Knight or The Usos.\n\nIn theory, these kinds of scenes are meant to establish The Vision as the bad guys who can throw their weight around as they please. In practice, though, they just feel like the creatives are treading water until the bigger shows come around.\n\nWWE’s success depends on its flagship monthly shows. And after a period of chop and change on that front, it now seems that Triple H has settled on his preferred schedule as to which PLEs we get and when. But has he picked the right ones?\n\nIt’s pretty clear some PLEs are working less well than others. Take WarGames, for example, which often feels contrived given the need to hastily assemble alliances that usually get dropped straight afterward. The women’s WarGames matches tend to feel like they were booked using a Harry Potter sorting hat.\n\nElimination Chamber is another one. It’s a fantastic gimmick match, but the fact that it is always used to decide the remaining WrestleMania main-eventers makes it much more predictable than it used to be. Why not go back to putting titles on the line directly in the cage (the U.S. title, for example) and give it a fresher feel?\n\nI call it the curse of the character relaunch. How many WWE wrestlers have we seen brought back with flashy vignettes and a new mystique, only to see the whole idea dropped within weeks?\n\nWhite the graveyard of failed relaunches goes back a long way (Giovanni Vinci, Giovanni Vinci, Veer Mahan…), the most notorious example of 2025 has to be the whole “Ron Killings” relaunch. Despite making a pretty big splash at the time, it has since been totally retconned from existence.\n\nI get that creatives need to run ideas up the flagpole and see what works. But how is that meant to happen when things get dropped before they’ve even had a chance to make an impact?\n\nA quick question: What exactly was the reasoning for WWE’s Women’s Champion having a non-title match against Michin on a recent “SmackDown”? Don’t get me wrong — I had no problem with the match, per se. But what was the justification for Jade Cargill not putting her title on the line?\n\nWe saw this happen a lot in WWE in 2025. Cargill’s predecessor, Tiffany Stratton, had no fewer than five non-title singles matches on “SmackDown.” It happened on the men’s side too. Standout examples include Cody Rhodes vs. Aleister Black in November, and John Cena vs. R-Truth at Saturday Night’s Main Event back in May.\n\nOn each of these occasions it was never explained exactly why they were non-title matches. Most of the time, the champion ended up winning cleanly anyway, leaving the question as to why it couldn’t have been a standard title match.\n\nIt’s time for a much stricter approach. Non-title matches should be kept for circumstances that justify the exception — champion vs. champion matches, for example — rather than used for the sake of it.\n\nThis one is a personal bugbear, and a much smaller one. But hey, if you can’t use these moments to settle a few scores, when can you do it?\n\nCan 2026 be the year that wrestling crowds finally stop with the cursing chants? We get it: People think it’s fun to chant “f*** you, Gunther” or the like. The problem is WWE’s televised shows are still a PG product and it just ends up with the production team censoring the audio in a way that makes the shows much less fun to watch.\n\nWould it really be so bothersome just to not swear in the first place? I know, I know — I’m shouting into the wind here. After all, this is the same fan base that insists on doing the “What?!” chant after every second promo.",

    "description": "Women's IC Champion Maxxine Dupri recently reflected on having a difficult time with hate she received online earlier in her career and how far she's progress.",
    "fullText": "WWE Women's Intercontinental Champion Maxxine Dupri shocked the WWE Universe when she defeated Becky Lynch on the November 17 edition of \"WWE Raw\" to take the gold from \"The Man,\" thanks to a little help from AJ Lee. Even before the victory, Dupri had already come a long way in WWE, from the manager of the Maxximum Male Models, to an actual in-ring competitor who is working hard to hone her craft. Dupri recently sat down with \"The Wrestling Classic\" and spoke about her evolution from fans booing her work during a live event to the point the locker room had to rally around her, to becoming champion.\n\n\"Thank you to my haters,\" she said. \"Truthfully, that live event, specifically, that didn't affect me personally. In the moment... When you're new to this and you're wrestling, I can't hear anything. I'm trying to make sure that I just survive this match and do the best I can do.\"\n\nDupri explained she did, however, have a hard time with hate she was getting on social media. She described it as a lesson she needed to learn and said people are entitled to their opinions, and she's entitled to protecting her peace.\n\n\"I have my people that give me my criticism and I know the things that I truly do need to work on that I'm falling short in, and I will always hold myself accountable for that and put my nose down and keep grinding,\" Dupri said. \"It was very challenging for a period of time, but there's pros and cons to everything and that's just part of this job.\"\n\nFans have been witness to a variety of video vignettes on \"Raw\" following her Women's Intercontinental Championship victory, showing Dupri working out in the Dudgeon alongside Natalya's \"Low Key Legend\" character, Nattie. Dupri said that Natalya, and her husband, former WWE star-turned-producer TJ Wilson, have single handedly changed the direction of her career thanks to their training.\n\n\"I think so much of this last year and everyone saying, 'Oh, Maxxine's improved a lot and we're seeing this new side.' It's truly what we do in the Dudgeon,\" she explained. \"Nattie says [it's] finding my 'FU.' It's the way that they push me to my limits in there... Pressure makes diamonds. They have to break you to make you and that is what happens in the Dudgeon.\"\n\nDupri said that the things she's learning in the Dudgeon are applicable to what she needs to be doing to remain on top of things in her matches to be able to stay on the offensive, as well as to reverse certain moves. She credited her training for her victory in her recent match against Ivy Nile. Dupri is set to square off with Lynch for the Women's IC title once again on the first \"Raw\" of 2026.\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit \"The Wrestling Classic\" and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s coverage of the final \"WWE SmackDown\" of 2025, coming to you from the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan this December 26 evening! Heat up your Christmas leftovers, put on your new pair of cozy pajamas, and get ready for an action-packed card to play this spectacular year out.\n\nDrew McIntyre has had a less than jolly season after WWE Universal Champion Cody Rhodes invaded his home mere days before last week's December 19 episode of \"SmackDown.\" While McIntyre was absent from WWE programming following the home break-in and subsequent brawl, \"The Scottish Psychopath\" is back with a vengeance. With the lines between in-ring competition and out-of-ring animosity now blurred beyond recognition, just what will McIntyre do in order to get his revenge against Rhodes in this rivalry-turned-blood feud?\n\nSpeaking of feuds, The Miz is out to reclaim his honor after receiving a Ten-Knuckle Shuffle at \"Saturday Night's Main Event,\" courtesy of R-Truth and Joe Hendry! Grand Rapids will be chanting the name of the former TNA World Champion as he appears to take on the former WWE world titleholder in singles action. While this is looking to be a typical one-on-one affair, The Miz is notorious for bending the rules in order to come out with a win. Will the new-age Hendry be able to withstand the veteran Miz's underhanded tactics, or will Hendry's viral moments crumble under The Miz's tried-and-true tenacity?\n\nIn the vein of tried-and-true tenacity, United States Champion Ilja Dragunov is set to defend his title in yet another installation of his Open Challenge series. So far, he has defended his title against the likes of Tommaso Ciampa, J.D. McDonagh, both halves of Fraxiom, Carmelo Hayes, and others. Dragunov has mostly been able to steer clear of controversy and repeat challengers during his time as United States Champion, but recently defeated challengers Ciampa, Johnny Gargano, and Candace LeRae may not be done with him just yet. Who can Dragunov rely on to even the numbers, or will \"The Mad Dragon\" be faced with the impossible-to-win numbers game to end 2025?\n\nAll will be revealed when WWE's blue brand comes to life tonight, at 8PM Eastern, 7PM Central!\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

McCarthy and what he looks like in Kevin O'Connell's offense as he goes through sort of what his rookie year is.

    "fullText": "After two major wins this year, GUNTHER now has the unique distinction of retiring John Cena and Goldberg, both of whom are considered legends within WWE. Outside of their high-profile status in WWE, though, \"The Ring General\" indicates that Cena and Goldberg vastly differ. During a new interview with TMZ's \"Inside The Ring,\" he explained how.\n\n\"Very different situation I think because Goldberg was also way more limited than John was. John was just a better wrestler over all his whole career. It's not like it dig to Goldberg. He didn't get famous by putting on in-ring master classes. That was never his thing, so it was a very different situation,\" GUNTHER said when asked to contrast his encounters with Cena and Goldberg.\n\n\"Also the magnitude of it. Obviously, Goldberg is a big name, but it's not comparable to what John Cena represents or the following he has, what he carries with him, and the connection that people have to him. It was hard to compare.\"\n\nGUNTHER's faceoff with Goldberg came at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event on July 12, which ended with the latter passing out to the former's sleeper hold. At SNME on December 13, GUNTHER again emerged victorious with his sleeper hold, this time by making Cena, a conduit of perseverance, tap out.\n\nFollowing their retirement matches, Goldberg and Cena have officially hung up their wrestling boots, or sneakers in Cena's case, at the ages of 58 and 48, respectively. Cena remains a part of the WWE family through his role as an ambassador.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Inside The Ring\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

Because I feel like I have one of the most profound histories with John Cena. I've been tag team champions with him, I beat him in the main event of WrestleMania, I've had multiple WrestleManias with John Cena. How many people can actually say that?\" Miz said. \"And I feel it's [relationship with Cena] gone through maybe 15 or 20 chapters.\"\n\nMiz went on to say that he campaigned for the match, but because of \"certain circumstances,\" it never came to fruition.\n\n\"I went to everyone. It's not even that it was shot down. There were instances where it could've happened, and things happen in this industry that nobody really knows about and you don't need to know about, right? There was a moment where it could've happened, but then that moment went away because of certain circumstances. And so, it never came back.\"\n\nAdd the exclusion of Miz from Cena's last chapter as another questionable decision from WWE creative in their handling of Cena's retirement run.\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit the \"SI Media\" podcast and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Stephanie Vaquer is still Women's World Champion, but she won her \"WWE Raw\" match against Judgment Day's Raquel Rodriguez by interference when WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella came through the crowd and caused a disqualification. Rodriguez had established herself as number one contender to Vaquer's title last week, when she took out Bella as she was attempting to demand her rematch after her loss to Vaquer at Survivor Series.\n\nRodriguez tried to overpower Vaquer to start off their match, and she got a lot of offense in throughout the bout. Vaquer went to the top rope to hit a flying cross body, but her challenger caught her and slammed her to the canvas. The champion tried to get Rodriguez in an armbar around the ropes, but before the referee could even begin a five count, Rodriguez had Vaquer up and hit a power bomb.\n\nVaquer hit the Devil's Kiss in the middle of the ring, causing Rodriguez to retreat to the corner where Vaquer hit her with a meteora. She tried to get Rodriguez up for the SVB, but couldn't. On the outside of the ring, Rodriguez caught a second Vaquer cross body and looked to throw her into the ring post, but Vaquer countered and sent Rodriguez face-first into the post.\n\nIt was then that Bella came out of the crowd to attack Vaquer. She connected with the Rack Attack 2.0 in the ring and later in a backstage segment, Bella said she demanded respect as a legend in the business from the other women.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

Wherever that is at, who knows, whether it's for one night or 200 nights. We'll see.\"\n\nAs for Nikki, she wished that she will become the Women's World Champion in the near future, but together both sisters hope they can have the opportunity to win the Women's Tag Team Championships before they retire.

Cena originally tied Flair in 2017 when he finally scored a victory over AJ Styles, but for years fans questioned if WWE would allow the 48-year-old to become the sole holder of the milestone. However, Cena himself was unsure about beating Flair's record, as he outlined his respect for \"The Nature Boy\" during in an interview on \"Insight,\" and hopes to one day congratulate the performer that wins 18 world titles.\n\n\"I have been apprehensive for quite some time for that because I love Ric. Super mentor to me. Always been a great guy to me and I love him. I meant what I said in the press conference at Rumble ... I want to win 17 so I can shake the hand of the performer that wins 18. So what it meant to me personally was like, hey youngins, one of them is going to be you or you better get working because I don't want to be in the ground when 18 happens. I want to shake somebody's hand and something that's impossible is now possible. So that's what it means to me of hopefully by my actions, this is possible, and holy hell this guy wants to shake my hand when I pass it and I can't wait to do that.\"\n\nCena's Undisputed WWE Championship reign would last 105 days before he was dethroned by Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam this past August. Cena never received an opportunity to win back the gold, and instead set his sights on the Intercontinental Title, where he would defeat Dominik Mysterio and officially become a Grand Slam Champion.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the iconic career of WWE legend John Cena will get a ceremonious end. His match with Gunther will conclude a year-long retirement tour where he took part in many entertaining matchups. However, during the tour and throughout his career, there were several dream matchups that wrestling fans missed out on.\n\nWith his career officially over, we look at six matches wrestling fans never got during John Cena’s incomparable career.\n\nDespite being on the roster together during both of Drew McIntyre’s two stints in WWE, he never faced Cena. He was also a popular pick to get a match with the legend during his 2025 tour. Yet, the stars never aligned, and the future Hall of Famer never got to face the current and best version of the “Scottish Psycho.”\n\nLA Knight nearly got his opportunity to face Cena, but came up just short to Gunther in the “Last Time is Now Tournament” final. It would have made sense for Knight to face Cena and win as a passing of the torch moment. The former United States champion would have also been a good opponent option during Cena’s short heel run. Alas, it never happened.\n\nCena wasn’t a star during Bill Goldberg’s first run in WWE, but he was an icon when he made his surprise return in the late 2010s. A dream match between them at WrestleMania could have been epic as the two powerhouses and wrestling greats went toe-to-toe in a match few would have expected. Yet, the company chose to have the former WCW champion focus on a long feud with Brock Lesnar instead of a matchup with John Cena.\n\nJey Uso eliminated John Cena in this year’s Royal Rumble. There were rumblings about a match between the two after that, but it never happened. A clash between the two would have been a lot of fun since they are two of the most beloved characters in WWE right now. Instead, Uso was busy in the World Heavyweight title picture for much of 2025.\n\nTo many wrestling fans, Japanese icon Kazuchika Okada is seen as NJPW’s version of Cena. That is why the two facing off is a unique dream match some fans hoped to see. However, when Okada chose to sign with AEW in March of last year, it killed any chance of that matchup ever happening.\n\nRic Flair has faced many elite stars from multiple generations. However, John Cena was not one of the. The idea of the long-time leader for most world title reigns facing the man who would eventually beat his record could have been interesting, but they never went toe-to-toe in that short period during the end of Flair’s run as an active competitor in WWE.\n\nShane McMahon, surprisingly, got to face many WWE legends during his part-time run wrestling in his father’s company. Yet, despite getting huge matchups with all-time greats like The Undertaker, Steve Austin, and The Rock, McMahon never got a one-on-one match with Cena. The bout probably would have been a lot of fun, especially the build-up to the unexpected bout.\n\nSaturday Night’s Main Event Results: Highlights From John Cena Retirement Match & Grades\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden\n\nMLB Free Agency Predictions: Projecting Landing Spots for Top 5 MLB Free Agents Right Now",

    "description": "WWE star Becky Lynch believes all pro wrestlers likely have at least one specific thing in common with each other.",
    "fullText": "As a worldwide phenomenon, professional wrestling has long attracted performers with diverse backgrounds. In the case of Becky Lynch, her roots were initially anchored in Ireland, but later expanded to countries such as Canada, Japan, and the United States. Whatever one's history may be, though, Lynch believes all wrestlers likely have at least one specific thing in common.\n\n\"I was just going [to training] so that I would be less of a delinquent,' Lynch recalled on \"First We Feast.\" \"[It was just] to organize my life and get my act together, and it did. I started doing better at school. I started training. It changed everything. It changed everything in my life, but it wasn't for the goal of becoming a professional wrestler. I found a community that I loved. I found that if I worked hard at something, I could get better at it. And I was never good at anything. There's something about wrestlers, maybe there's like a little screw loose, I don't know, but there is something that bonds us all together.\n\n\"You meet so many different people from different walks of life,\" she continued. \"We were all like co-mingling and having a great time and having the banter and having the crack and having the fun. Crack means fun; we weren't doing drugs.\"\n\nAccording to Lynch, her connection to wrestling extends back to early childhood, when she and her brother watched it together on television. After they took a break from it, the siblings returned to wrestling during WWE's Attitude Era, with Lynch especially drawn to the passionate promos of Mick Foley. Overall, she says it was the storytelling that won her over, more so than the physical action.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"First We Feast\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "The man behind the \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase will fight for the final time on Saturday night. But who is he, really?",
    "fullText": "The Last Time Is Now. It's the name given to the tournament in which 16 wrestling giants have been competing to be the one opponent in John Cena's final fight before retirement.\n\nAnd that final fight is now - Saturday night - in Washington DC, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career that has seen the American become one of wrestling's biggest and most bankable stars.\n\nIn the 8,570 days since his debut, Cena has clinched 17 world titles and coined the iconic \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase - but the 48-year-old's impact goes far beyond that.\n\nIf you were to pose the question \"who is John Cena?\", depending on who you ask, the answers might vary from legendary WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) superstar, to successful film actor, while some will say he's Mr Make-A-Wish (more on that later).\n\nHow to watch John Cena's last match:\n\nStart time: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event is scheduled to begin at 01:00 GMT on Sun 14 Dec\n\nWhere to watch: In the UK, you can watch for free on WWE's official YouTube channel. Internationally it can be watched on Netflix, and on Peacock in the US\n\nSince his 2002 debut, there's been an evolution in his own wrestling character - transitioning from \"ruthless aggression\" rookie, to a \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" rapper, and eventually a heroic character known for a \"Never Give Up\" attitude.\n\nDespite criticism from some fans of his in-ring ability, with occasional chants of \"you can't wrestle\" through the years, \"there's no doubt that he's an exceptional wrestling talent\", says Brandon Thurston, editor and owner of wrestling website, Wrestlenomics.\n\nHe feels something changed in 2005, after which WWE became \"increasingly scripted in a way it had not been\" before, as it entered into a more controlled, family friendly PG era. But Cena managed thrive.\n\n\"He's definitely been the biggest draw over the time which I would say stretches from 2005 to roughly 2015,\" Mr Thurston says, with Cena's merchandise also regularly topping sales for the company.\n\n\"There's little question that he was WWE's most important economic wrestler throughout that time - in terms of pay-per-view buys, which were still central in that era, TV ratings, and as a house show draw.\"\n\nOutside the ring too, he's a personality who \"people gravitate towards and want to listen to\", says Mr Thurston - and wrestling fans like Joe Clarkson and Sabrina Nicole feel just that.\n\n\"To go for such a long time in an industry, which is quite heavily taxing on the body, is absolutely fascinating,\" says Joe, 24, who was five when he first saw Cena on TV.\n\n\"I think over time, the people just gained more and more respect for him, not just as a performer, but also as an individual.\"\n\nFor Sabrina, 37, who remembers Cena's WWE debut in 2002, it's \"his charisma\".\n\n\"He has just always had something about him that makes him a star,\" she says, adding that for most of his career, he's \"always maintained a good guy persona\".\n\n\"No matter what the crowd, no matter what the fans have thought of him. He has just been the testament to if you have a really good character, you can be on top,\" she says.\n\nIt also seems to be true that, beyond his ability and persona, Cena seized an opportunity.\n\nWith The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin no longer full-time performers, WWE bosses were looking for a new star to emerge.\n\nBrandon feels WWE leadership recognised Cena \"would be a very reliable and extremely hardworking person whom they could entrust with such a spot\".\n\nIt's widely accepted within wrestling circles that the final decision to have Cena as the chosen star would ultimately have been taken by then-WWE chairman Vince McMahon.\n\nWhile he was known for following his instincts, there will also have been a judgement on Cena's ability to connect with a passionate crowd on the mic, his marketability and whether he could be in the industry long enough to be profitable.\n\nAnd when Cena started taking more time away from wrestling in 2015 and working a reduced schedule, Mr Thurston feels there was a \"decline\" in the WWE product.\n\nOther wrestling experts have suggested Cena's presence over the years helped slow the slide of WWE ratings trending downwards which, according to analysis by wrestling site PWtorch, saw average viewership for its flagship weekly Raw programme fall by a million between 2010 and 2015, to 3.7m.\n\nHaving achieved so much within wrestling, Cena could \"just come in and be a wrestler and walk out\", adds Dr Gillian Brooks, associate professor in marketing at King's Business School, but instead she says he built a personal brand that comes across as real.\n\nAmong the brands Cena has worked with is Neutrogena, becoming the face of its sunscreen campaign after revealing he had skin cancer spots - which he attributed to his own lack of sun protection use.\n\nHe also holds the Guinness World Record for the number of wishes granted through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with more than 650 fulfilled wishes for children with critical illnesses. It's a partnership he revealed had started by \"accident\", but one he's kept since 2002, describing it as \"the coolest thing\".\n\n\"If you think about it from a child's perspective, they're seeing someone that they've seen on TV watching WWE or in films, and they suddenly get to meet him,\" Dr Brooks says. \"The fact that he's doing charity work, he's written a children's book, been in films, made music… all these things illustrate that he's not a one show pony.\n\n\"It's coming across in a way that's very authentic and very sort of pure to who he is.\"\n\nBoth Cena's personal brand and his charisma are set to live on, but his time in the ring looks to have come to an end after Cena announced last year that 2025 would be his last as a competitor.\n\nExplaining his reasoning at the time, he told of the physical toll wrestling had taken on his body.\n\nHis career has seen him undergo several operations, including on his neck, pec and triceps, with Cena saying in interviews that his \"body hurts\" and is \"screaming to close the chapter\".\n\nWhile the old saying \"never say never\" is a popular one, Cena has repeatedly said he will be \"100% done\" - and has received rousing receptions around the world for his final appearances.\n\nOverall, fan Joe is happy with Cena's \"retirement run\", with matches against old rivals such as AJ Styles, Randy Orton and CM Punk, and newer stars including Dominik Mysterio and Gunther.\n\nHe does feel the \"execution\" of his final year could have been better though, with Cena's short-term \"heel turn\" (becoming a villain) at the Elimination Chamber event in March drawing criticism.\n\n\"It could have been handled better,\" Joe says. \"[But] he's had such a unique distinction of having a retirement run that no one's ever had before.\n\n\"It's very sad to see him retire now. But I think he said it himself - it's the right time.\"\n\nNot that WWE fans will never see Cena again; he has signed a five-year deal to be an ambassador for the company.\n\nHaving won The Last Time Is Now tournament, it's former world heavyweight champion Gunther who will face Cena in his final fight.\n\nWith it not being broadcast on terrestrial TV, but rather on streaming platforms, it's been reported that there is no time limit on the match - and Gunther, who has never wrestled Cena before, has been giving much tough talk.\n\nOne thing's for sure: \"You Can't See Me\" might be the taunt Cena gives Gunther, but the last fight will be seen and remembered by many.\n\nGrand Theft Auto made him a legend. His latest game was a disaster\n\nSo bad they're good - why do we love terrible films?\n\nWhy Indiana Jones, Barbie and other US films were shot in UK",

    "title": "The 3 faces of John Cena: How WWE's franchise player became bigger than wrestling",
    "description": "When looking at John Cena’s legacy, it boils down to a trio of personas that embodied the superstar who defined a generation.",
    "fullText": "How do you effectively sum up the career of a legend?\n\nHow do you take a quarter-century worth of accomplishments, championships and memories and boil them down into something easily digestible, yet appropriately meaningful at the same time?\n\nHow do you quantify a once-in-a-generation run in a realm that doesn’t track bumps taken, finishers hit or smiles delivered?\n\nIn an industry as unquantifiable as professional wrestling, you swerve everyone, and look at the numbers.\n\nThere’s the biggest one, 17, representing the record number of world championships won. There’s 26, the number of years wrestled when all is said and done. There’s 1,554, the tally of matches to this point in the career. There’s 100, the number of victories at premium live events — when the lights are brightest.\n\nAll of those are great, but they fail to encapsulate John Cena, who, on Saturday, will wrestle for the final time in a WWE ring. For Cena, the number that should exemplify his legacy is three.\n\nThere’s an intended irony in describing a retiring pro wrestler’s career with the number three, as it represents a finality in the ring, but when looking at Cena’s legacy, it boils down to a trio of personas that embodied the superstar who defined a generation.\n\nFrom an in-ring perspective, Cena’s style worked incredibly well for what it was.\n\nNever a high-flyer or traditional worker — there’s a reason it took until his final months for Cena to capture the WWE Intercontinental Championship, known as the worker’s title — the early portions of Cena’s career became defined by a power-based attack and a moveset that came to be known as the “Five Moves of Doom,” which would usually be unleashed after taking a beating from his opponent and ultimately result in a win. The rinse-and-repeat formula earned him the nickname “Super Cena” from fans who were disenfranchised with the repetitive nature of his matches.\n\nStill, there were many high points that proved these criticisms of Cena to be largely unfounded and subjective.\n\nDuring the late 2000s, Cena’s rivalries with Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton and Edge produced classics that still hold up today. His return at the 2008 Royal Rumble is among the biggest in the history of the event. Cena headlined six WrestleManias, including three consecutive from 2011 to 2013, wrestling a pair of underrated matches against Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in a proverbial passing-of-the-torch moment. His 2011 Money in the Bank championship match against CM Punk still stands out as one of the best of his career and helped cement Punk’s status as a legend in WWE.\n\nCena’s style was what fit for himself and WWE at the time. It was part of what made him such an excellent contrast with the likes of Michaels, Edge, Punk and, later in his career, AJ Styles, all of whom had higher in-ring work rates. He also had seemingly limitless strength, lifting Big Show, Mark Henry and, at times, multiple wrestlers onto his shoulders for his Attitude Adjustment finisher.\n\nThe arrival of Styles helped Cena shed any perceived slights about his in-ring ability. Cena and Styles met for the first time on a WWE PLE at Money in the Bank in 2016, but their best match of that initial run came at SummerSlam that same year. It was an instant classic, showcasing the contrasting styles of both men and seemingly unlocking something in Cena as the quality of his matches quickly began to outweigh the sheer quantity of them.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Cena also quelled misconceptions about burying talent. Alongside the “Super Cena” critiques came the notion that his star shined at the expense of younger talent. While it’s not an uncommon criticism at the top of the card in professional wrestling, in Cena's case, he played a pivotal role in introducing the Nexus and elevating the United States Championship, with his open challenge serving as the main roster introductions for the likes of Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn.\n\nThis final run as an in-ring performer has been among Cena’s best — again, quality over quantity.\n\nCena’s shown a mastery of ring psychology, an expanded moveset and the same Herculean power that made him one of the greatest of all time. Renewed rivalries with Orton and Punk have hit every note of nostalgia you would expect. His final match with Cody Rhodes provided both another five-star effort and his own passing-of-the-torch moment, 12 years after WrestleMania 29. His reunion with AJ Styles was a swan song for two icons that will not be matched any time soon. Perhaps the most telling thing about Cena's entire run is that, despite what he has said in interviews about this final year, he never appeared to slow down in the ring.\n\nIn many ways, Cena probably shouldn’t have been as successful as he has been. After bursting onto the scene in 2001 more as “The Prototype” than “John Cena,” it took the Massachusetts native some time to find his footing in WWE.\n\nUltimately, Cena’s charisma and talent as an entertainer won out, leading to his freestyle-rapping, jersey-wearing “Doctor of Thuganomics” character. What feels dated in 2025 worked immensely for Cena 20 years ago, connecting him with the crowd in a way that would only enhance and evolve at seemingly every turn for the next two decades.\n\nCena faced two major transitional hurdles in his career, particularly as he moved up the card in WWE.\n\nFirst, with Stone Cold Steve Austin retired and The Rock focused on Hollywood, there was a void as WWE moved from the beloved “Attitude Era” around 2002 into what is now looked back on as the “Ruthless Aggression Era.” Cena — and fellow OVW standouts Batista, Brock Lesnar and Orton — helped bridge the gap, even with legends like The Undertaker, Michaels and Triple H still occupying main-event slots, but none reached the heights that Cena did.\n\nThe second challenge ran parallel to the first. While violence and sex appeal helped WWE win the Monday Night Wars, the company was set to move into a more family-friendly direction by the summer of 2008: The “PG Era.”\n\nCena, after rising to fame as the “Doctor of Thuganomics,” essentially scrubbed his character, trading the throwback jerseys for brightly colored WWE-branded merch, renaming his signature move from its original moniker — the F-U — and weaving in themes of patriotism and military after starring in “The Marine.” While the trademark intensity was still there, the message and tone shifted in a way that matched the direction WWE wanted to go and cemented Cena as the purest babyface character of the past quarter century.\n\nThroughout all of it, Cena’s ability to connect with an audience and deliver meaningful promos never wavered. There was merchandise, catchphrases, a rap album — including his own now-timeless theme — movies, commercials and plenty more that all played a role in building Cena up into one of the most impactful entertainers in pro-wrestling history.\n\nAs Cena’s career progressed, particularly as he shifted from full-time WWE superstar to dipping his foot into the Hollywood pond, a new authenticity came when he picked up the microphone in the ring. Rather than sticking strictly to kayfabe, Cena consistently broke the fourth wall in a way that elevated his segments, while also serving as a wink and a nod to a professional wrestling culture that was increasingly online and connected to behind-the-scenes happenings.\n\nEven during his retirement tour, Cena showed new depth as an entertainer. Say what you will about his overall 2025 heel run, Cena strung us along in the early part of the year and the turn itself was arguably as stunning as we’ve seen since July 7, 1996. Then, when it was time to turn again, Cena flipped the switch and it was back to business.\n\nThe final pillar of Cena’s legacy is perhaps the most important. Beyond the 17 world championships or the millions of dollars in merchandise and tickets sold stands Cena’s role as an ambassador for WWE.\n\nFor 20 years, Cena served as a reliable spokesperson for WWE, capable of presenting the very best the company had to offer with a squeaky-clean image and charisma for days.\n\nWWE needed to promote an event? Send Cena to Kimmel or Conan.\n\nNickelodeon needs a host for the Kid’s Choice Awards? Call Cena.\n\nFor a billion-dollar company, Cena was the QB1 of QB1s when it came to public relations, but it stretched beyond that.\n\nCena has worked extensively with Make-A-Wish throughout his career, granting more than 650 wishes for sick children and their families as the current Guinness World Record holder for the foundation. As much as the IWC will debate star ratings or get into tribal feuds over promotions, Cena’s generosity and kind heart are an undeniable measure of his greatness not just as a performer, but as a human being.\n\nCena embraced his role as a real-life superhero for millions of kids, offering up just a few minutes of his time to brighten up the lives of those who needed it most.\n\nHaving examined the elements that made Cena who he is today, we have to ask how do you sum it all up?\n\nHave there been and will there be better wrestlers than Cena? Yes.\n\nHave there been and will there be better entertainers than Cena? Yes, but there’s so much subjectivity involved that it’s very much up for debate.\n\nHave there been or will there be better ambassadors than Cena? Almost certainly not.\n\nIn a world built on kayfabe, Cena brought an authenticity that overcame industry-wide shifts, thriving across multiple decades, showcasing longevity that lasted from flip phones to FaceTime.\n\nIn a landscape that begs for change — in character or company — Cena embodied his motto, “hustle, loyalty, respect\" better than maybe anyone ever, and when he did turn, the wrestling world collectively said “no thanks, we like it better the old way.”\n\nWith the last time finally being now, it’s all clear:\n\nWe won’t see another John Cena again.",

    "description": "AEW star Bryan Danielson explains why he wasn't bothered by his WWE WrestleMania 28 loss, which saw him get beaten by Sheamus in eighteen seconds",
    "fullText": "It's hard to believe that the moment that arguably kickstarted Bryan Danielson to WWE, and later AEW superstardom, wasn't when he won the Undisputed Championship at WrestleMania 30, but was a moment that left fans in the uproar. Indeed, Danielson's success story can be traced back to a WrestleMania 28 match with Sheamus, where the latter defeated Danielson to win the World Heavyweight Championship in 18 seconds. It was a booking decision seemingly made to get Sheamus over, only it instead rallied the fans around the heel Danielson, leading to a groundswell of support that has arguably continued to this day.\n\nAppearing on \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet,\" Danielson reminisced on the moment, even sharing a funny interaction with a co-worker backstage after the loss. He also explained why the months that followed led to him not being all that upset with how things turned out.\n\n\"When they had Sheamus beat me in 18 seconds at WrestleMania...28 maybe...the fans were just 'Yesing!' like crazy when I went out there,\" Danielson said. \"You could tell they were bummed when the match was so short. Then I walked to the back and The Great Khali of all people was like 'That was f*****g b******t!' And I was like 'Oh! Khali, I didn't know you cared. Thank you!' But then, like, the next night I was like 'Okay, well, there's a lot of people 'Yesing!'' But it just kept going. That was kind of...when after a couple of months after that, and it was still happening, I was like 'Okay. This is going to be here for a bit.'\"\n\nEven if it hadn't worked out that way, Danielson still seemed to indicate that the loss wouldn't have bothered him too much. Though he admitted that he was confused by WWE's decision at the time, he also admitted he didn't fight the decision, partially because it wasn't in his nature to begin with, and also because he feels that isn't the best course. He then pointed to an AEW star and former rival of his as an example of how to handle situations like that.\n\n\"I've never been somebody who's like 'Wait a second, why would you beat me in 18 seconds?'\" Danielson said. \"Or 'Why would you just beat me with one move?' or whatever. I was like 'Okay, that's the creative direction. I'm going to do the best I can with it.' I find that a lot of people put up stinks about a lot of things, whatever it is...You could put up a little resistance if you really don't like something.\n\n\"But then if this is what the boss wants, you're better off to do your absolute best at what the boss wants, and then try to get over from that. I think a great example in AEW is Swerve Strickland. He came in and he lost a lot of matches. But it was always 'Yes sir Tony. Whatever you need, I'll go out there and do.' And now look at him. He's main evented PPV's. He's a World Champion. He's fantastic.\"\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet\" and provide an h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Oba Femi defeated Je'Von Evans with a helping hand from Ricky Saints in the main event of \"WWE NXT.\"",
    "fullText": "Ricky Saints cost Je'Von Evans the NXT Championship in his challenge against Oba Femi in the main event of \"WWE NXT.\"\n\nEvans interrupted Saints earlier in the show as the former champion sought a rematch for the title he had lost at Deadline. And given that Evans was the Iron Survivor coming out of the same event, he made the case that he should get the next opportunity at the title and didn't want to wait for New Year's Evil. Saints originally pushed back on the idea, but Evans appeared to talk him down and he stepped aside for Evans to challenge Femi in the main event.\n\nThe challenger went on to endure everything the champion could throw at him, getting the better of things on the outside of the ring before returning and seeming to have the match under wraps. He connected with his springboard cutter and went for what looked like the winning cover, only for the referee to be yanked from the ring before the three-count could be made.\n\nEvans turned to realize that it was Saints that had cost him, with them staring one another down as Femi got back to his feet. He clattered his challenger with a lariat, delivering the finishing powerbomb for the winning pinfall.\n\nAfter the match, Femi walked off with his title, confirming that it will be him going into this weekend's Saturday Night's Main Event against WWE Champion, Cody Rhodes. He gave a disapproving look to Saints, who simply shrugged it off and continued to smile at Evans defeated in the ring as the show went off air.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.
