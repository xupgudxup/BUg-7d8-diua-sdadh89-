    "fullText": "Paramount-Skydance has emerged as the winner in a multi-round battle for the future of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNetflix backed out — and stands to pocket $2.8 billion in breakup fees — after the Larry and David Ellison-run company made a higher bid.\n\nHere's what smart people in business and politics are saying about the deal.\n\nThe cofounder of wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki, which manages $4 billion, joked about the economics of the deal on X. WBD owes Netflix nearly $3 billion in a breakup fee.\n\n\"Haha. They paid $110 billion. Netflix gets $2.8 billion. Zaslov laughing to the bank. Welcome to Hollywood kid,\" Gerber said of WBD CEO David Zaslav.\n\nOn Monday, Gerber posted that Paramount could \"way overpay\" for WBD, allowing Netflix to \"walk away with Billions and a huge win saddling paramount with losses forever.\"\n\nThe Wharton School assistant professor, who researches mergers and acquisitions, wrote in an X post that the deal gave Netflix a way out.\n\n\"What is surprising to me is the speed with which Netflix had pulled out, and I respect their choice not to pretend they're still in it and prolong the game,\" Nary wrote.\n\n\"If WBD had indications of Netflix losing their faith in the deal, the change in their tone towards Paramount, dialing back their expectations for the headline price - all of these make sense now,\" Nary added.\n\nThe Democratic senator opposed last year's Paramount-Skydance merger and has scrutinized the latest company deal.\n\nIn a statement, Warren raised questions about the White House's alignment with Paramount Skydance.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that he was staying out of the battle for WBD — and that both bidders had called him. He said the deal would go to the Department of Justice.\n\n\"A Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. merger is an antitrust disaster threatening higher prices and fewer choices for American families,\" Warren said.\n\nShe added, \"A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want.\"\n\nThe lawmaker said, \"It'll be up to the American people to speak up and state attorneys general to enforce the law.\"\n\nOn Thursday, California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in a statement that the transaction was \"not a done deal.\"\n\n\"The California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Update: Shortly after this story was published, Netflix announced that it would not raise its bid for WBD.\n\nParamount Skydance may finally have the upper hand on Netflix in the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe WBD board announced on Thursday afternoon that it believes Paramount's improved offer to buy the entire company for $31 per share is better than Netflix's proposal to buy its streaming and studio assets for $27.75 per share. Both offers are all cash.\n\nParamount's bid also includes a so-called \"ticking fee,\" which will pay WBD shareholders $0.25 per share, or about $650 million, for every quarter that its deal doesn't get regulatory approval, starting September 30.\n\nNetflix now has four business days to raise its bid, if it chooses. It could also decide to walk away and collect a $2.8 billion breakup fee from WBD, which Paramount has said it will cover.\n\n\"While Netflix has the opportunity to increase its bid and reclaim WBD, the bigger question is if it's in Netflix's interest to continue pursuit,\" said Ross Benes, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. \"Netflix and Paramount stocks have taken a hit since this bidding war started. Investors will not be keen on increasing bids further.\"\n\nIf Netflix doesn't improve its offer, WBD's board will formally change its recommendation and kill its Netflix deal. WBD shareholders will vote on March 20 to approve the transaction with the highest bidder.\n\nParamount and Netflix have each been on a mission to convince Hollywood, consumers, and government officials that they'd be the better buyer of Warner Bros.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount is willing to pay WBD a $7 billion breakup fee if its deal is blocked by regulators, a sign of his confidence in winning over the US Department of Justice under President Donald Trump. (Netflix has agreed to pay WBD $5.8 billion if regulators blocked its deal.) Ellison would also need regulatory approval in Europe and could face challenges at the state level in the US.\n\nParamount has warned that Netflix would become an overpowering juggernaut if it bought HBO and the Warner Bros. studio. Netflix has argued that it competes with YouTube and traditional TV, not just paid streamers.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has been on a charm offensive, telling politicians, the creative community, and the public that Netflix would create jobs if it bought Warner Bros. Sarandos visited the White House this week, Politico reported.\n\nTrump said earlier this month he'd stay out of the process, though he said in December that Netflix's market share \"could be a problem.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nTrump, however, said shortly after that Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board and would otherwise \"pay the consequences.\" Rice, who worked in the White House under Obama and Biden, was critical of Trump on a podcast and said companies that bow to him could face retribution. Sarandos downplayed Trump's comments, saying that the company's plan to buy Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"\n\nParamount has promised investors $6 billion in savings if it wins the bidding war, compared to Netflix's target of $2 billion to $3 billion. WBD's board, as recently as last week, expressed concern that could lead to an employee exodus if Paramount won control of the company.",

    "description": "Netflix said it wouldn't pay more for Warner Bros., and the deal was \"no longer financially attractive,\" two days after Paramount increased its offer.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has won the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNetflix said Thursday it won't raise its bid, paving the way for Paramount to buy WBD and become a Hollywood behemoth.\n\nThe decision comes two days after Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share for all of WBD, including its cable networks like CNN and HGTV. WBD's board said Thursday that Paramount's latest offer was better than Netflix's proposal to buy its streaming and studio assets — including Warner Bros. and HBO Max — for $27.75 per share.\n\n\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.\"\n\nNetflix will now pocket a $2.8 billion breakup fee paid by WBD, which Paramount has said it will reimburse.\n\nNetflix investors seem thrilled. The stock surged by more than 10% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Paramount shares jumped about 5%.\n\nWBD shares slipped 1.8%, a potential sign that shareholders were counting on an even bigger bidding war.\n\nA combination of Paramount and WBD could create a true rival to Hollywood leaders Netflix and Disney. However, despite its size, it would still face the daunting task of transitioning legacy media assets — including declining cable TV networks — to a new era dominated by streaming and social media.\n\n\"We are excited about the potential of a combined Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery and can't wait to get started working together telling the stories that move the world,\" WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a statement.\n\nEllison has relentlessly pursued WBD for months, making 10 official offers for the company. His pursuit of WBD has been backed by his father, Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of cloud giant Oracle.\n\nParamount already owns its iconic movie studio, Paramount+, CBS, and TV networks like MTV and Comedy Central.\n\nIf Paramount's WBD deal secures regulatory approvals, it will get the Warner Bros. studio, HBO, HBO Max, and cable networks like CNN, TNT, and HGTV, plus the Discovery+ streaming service.\n\nThough the combination would make Ellison a Hollywood heavyweight, his company would still fall behind Netflix in a few key metrics.\n\nHBO Max had 131.6 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter, while Paramount+ had 78.9 million paid subscribers as of late 2025.\n\nNetflix crossed 325 million subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nWBD's streaming services accounted for 1.4% TV share on US TVs in January, according to Nielsen, compared to 2.3% for Paramount's streamers. For comparison, Netflix was at 8.8% while Disney's streamers got 4.9%.\n\nOne side plot is that CNN may soon find itself with the same corporate parent as CBS News, which Ellison has begun to remake by installing the polarizing Bari Weiss as its editor in chief.\n\nParamount has framed itself as a better buyer for WBD than Netflix, which it said would wield unhealthy sway over competitors and consumers if it bought HBO and gained access to iconic IP like DC Comics' Batman.\n\nNetflix argued that it would be a better caretaker of Warner Bros. by laying off fewer staffers than Paramount would, while creating TV jobs in a Hollywood plagued by fewer productions. Paramount has promised investors $6 billion in cost savings from the deal.\n\nBoth Netflix and Paramount have angled for support from regulators and President Donald Trump. Paramount is willing to pay WBD a $7 billion breakup fee if its deal is blocked, a sign of Ellison's confidence in regulatory approval.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider in mid-February that Trump had \"great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference\" for Netflix or Paramount.\n\nHowever, Netflix caught Trump's ire days later, with the president saying that the streaming giant must remove board member Susan Rice \"or pay the consequences.\" Rice, a White House official during the Obama and Biden administrations, appeared on a podcast and criticized Trump and companies she believes chose to \"take a knee\" to the president.\n\nSarandos previously downplayed Trump's comments, saying the Netflix-Warner Bros. tie-up is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison gave employees a shoutout after the media company roughly met Wall Street's estimates in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"The progress we've made over the past 6+ months — from advancing our strategy to strengthening our portfolio and reorganizing our businesses to operate more efficiently and effectively — is a direct reflection of your hard work and commitment,\" Ellison wrote in an email to staffers, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nEllison, who wants to turn his 114-year-old Hollywood studio into a tech-forward company, said in his memo that Paramount is focused on supercharging its tech and data capabilities.\n\n\"We recognize that in today's highly competitive marketplace, sustainable growth depends not only on what people watch, but on the quality of the overall user experience,\" Ellison wrote. \"That's why we are prioritizing investments in advanced technology and data capabilities to strengthen and differentiate our DTC offering. We are making meaningful investments across the company in innovation and technology, and we look forward to sharing more details in the coming months.\"\n\nThat message comes weeks after Ellison made data a bigger part of Paramount by expanding the role of the company's streaming data and insights team.\n\nParamount is planning to add short-form video to Paramount+ and is exploring ways to bring interactive features and user-generated content to its streamers, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nIn the memo, Ellison also emphasized storytelling, saying that he wants Paramount to be \"the home for the industry's leading creative talent.\" While Ellison lured former Netflix original content executive Cindy Holland to run its streaming business, Paramount is losing star TV creator Taylor Sheridan to rival NBCUniversal when his contract expires.\n\nParamount's biggest initiative is its quest to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, which seems increasingly open to Ellison's advances, even though it has a signed deal with Netflix.\n\nParamount's results were roughly in line with analyst expectations in its latest quarter, the first full quarter since Ellison took the helm in early August. As expected, Paramount's full-year revenue shrank for a second straight year to $28.89 billion, just under the estimate of $28.95 billion.\n\nParamount+ now has 78.9 million paid subscribers, up from 77.9 million last quarter and 4% higher than a year ago. Paramount's product chief told employees that its flagship streamer added about 1 million customers on the first day it carried UFC rights in the US, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRead Ellison's memo to Paramount employees here:",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance just revised its bid for WBD. David Ellison's new offer could put pressure on Netflix to change its own.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison's Paramount Skydance has revised its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, putting pressure on Netflix to follow suit.\n\nParamount did not publicly share a price for its revised bid, which is its 10th. The company's previous offer was for $30 per share.\n\nWBD told shareholders last week that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that its previous bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal.\n\n\"Following engagement with PSKY during the seven-day limited waiver period, we received a revised PSKY proposal to acquire WBD, which we are reviewing in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\" WBD said in a statement on Tuesday. \"We will update our shareholders following the Board's review. The Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction. WBD shareholders are advised not to take any action at this time with respect to the amended PSKY tender offer.\"\n\nIf WBD's board determines that Paramount's latest offer is \"potentially superior or superior\" to Netflix's, then Netflix would have four days to improve its offer, a person familiar with the deal process said.\n\nWBD previously turned down Paramount's offers and decided to sell key assets, including its studio and HBO, to Netflix for $27.75 per share. The Netflix deal doesn't include WBD's cable channels, such as HGTV and TNT, unlike Paramount's bid.\n\nA higher Paramount offer should come as little surprise, despite Ellison saying his previous bid was \"superior to Netflix's.\" Paramount had sweetened its offer several times before this latest one.\n\nThe Paramount head honcho was also overheard saying in mid-December that WBD's board couldn't accept his $30-per-share bid without \"admitting breach of fiduciary duty,\" Business Insider reported. That's because it was the same offer the WBD board — which has a duty to act in the best interest of shareholders — had previously rejected.\n\nAll this suggested that an upgraded bid could be in the works.\n\nWBD had raised several issues with Paramount's previous offers, including that its equity wasn't fully backstopped by Larry Ellison and its termination fee was lower than Netflix's. Paramount addressed both points. WBD then said there would be additional costs it would incur if it accepted Paramount's bid, such as a $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix, which Paramount said it had accounted for in its ninth bid.\n\nA key part of Paramount's argument is that WBD's TV networks aren't worth much, if anything, after factoring in debt and the trading price of Versant, a similar company.\n\nNetflix, for its part, is pitching itself as a better option for shareholders and the entertainment industry, and has said that a Netflix-Warner Bros. tie-up would \"create and protect jobs.\"\n\nThe merger would have to go through an antitrust review. One wild card is President Donald Trump. Last week, a White House spokesperson told Business Insider that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nThen, on Saturday, Trump called for Netflix to remove Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\" During a podcast appearance, Rice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, had made comments critical of the Trump administration and corporations that \"take a knee.\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos downplayed the president's comments on Monday and added that their bid for Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"\n\nRegardless of who wins between Netflix and Paramount, a bidding war would benefit WBD shareholders. Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, predicted in December that the battle between Netflix and Paramount could raise the cost to buy WBD by $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nEven if WBD's board rejects Paramount for a 10th time, Ellison can continue to make bids up until WBD's shareholder vote on March 20.",

    "fullText": "Feb 23 (Reuters) - Paramount Skydance submitted a higher offer for Warner Bros Discovery, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, ratcheting up efforts to derail the HBO Max owner's deal with Netflix.\n\nThe bidding war for one of Hollywood's most coveted assets including the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Game of Thrones\" franchises has raised ‌the stakes for dominance in the streaming-led market.\n\nHow does Netflix's bid compare to Paramount's proposal?\n\nWhy is Warner Bros Discovery a coveted acquisition target?\n\nWhat regulatory challenges could block these merger deals?\n\nWhat are the key details of Paramount's revised offer?\n\nParamount's new bid — which improves its initial offer of $108.4 billion, or $30 per share, for the whole company — seeks to address Warner Bros ‌concerns about the certainty of its financing, the source said.\n\nWarner Bros' chosen suitor Netflix, which offered to buy ​the studios and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in cash, or $82.7 billion, is allowed to match the latest bid from David Ellison-led Paramount.\n\nNetflix has ample cash and could bump up its offer for HBO Max owner, while Paramount's rival bid is backed by Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison.\n\nThe CBS parent was asked to submit its \"best and final offer\" after Warner Bros rejected an enhanced bid that included paying the $2.8 billion in termination fee to Netflix and adding a 25-cent per share quarterly \"ticking fee\" from next year to compensate Warner Bros shareholders for any delay in deal closure.\n\nWarner Bros had said Paramount's February 10 offer still falls short ‌of what its board would consider a superior proposal and gave ⁠a seven-day deadline until February 23 to submit a revised offer.\n\nMoffettNathanson analysts had earlier said that an offer in the range of $34 per share from Paramount would end the bidding war and \"avoid further debate over Discovery Global's value.\"\n\nWarner Bros plans to spin off Discovery Global, which holds cable TV assets such as ⁠CNN and HGTV, could fetch between $1.33 and $6.86 a share, according to Warner Bros estimates.\n\nNetflix said its offer gives Warner Bros shareholders added upside from the Discovery Global spinoff, which WBD argues will add value by giving the new company greater strategic, operational and financial flexibility.\n\nHowever, Paramount has said the cable spinoff central to the streaming giant's offer is effectively worthless.\n\nThe David Zaslav-led Warner Bros came under pressure from Ancora Capital after the activist investor ​built ​a roughly $200 million stake in the HBO owner and accused the company of failing to adequately engage with ​Paramount.",

    "title": "David Ellison's Paramount has some breathing room in its quest to buy WBD despite a pressing deadline",
    "description": "Paramount is in a bidding war with Netflix for Warner Bros. and has until March to make its best and final offer.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance is staring down a key deadline in its pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, but it doesn't need to make a move quite yet.\n\nDavid Ellison and company have been able to negotiate directly with WBD's leadership team in recent days for the first time in months — thanks to Netflix, Paramount's rival in the bidding war.\n\nNetflix granted WBD, its deal partner, a weeklong waiver on negotiation exclusivity that expires at midnight on Monday. The company said it hoped these talks between Paramount and WBD would \"fully and finally resolve\" the monthslong saga that it said has been an \"ongoing distraction\" for both Netflix and WBD shareholders.\n\nAs of midday Monday, Paramount hasn't made its \"best and final\" bid for WBD, though it doesn't necessarily have to rush. That's because the seven-day window that Netflix granted Warner Bros. is to talk with Paramount, not the deadline for Paramount to raise its bid.\n\n\"Anyone can make an offer up to the shareholder vote,\" a person familiar with the WBD-Paramount negotiations told Business Insider.\n\nWBD's shareholder vote is on March 20. At that meeting, investors can choose to either approve or reject the Netflix deal, or they can abstain. WBD shareholders who prefer Paramount's offer can tender their shares to Ellison and company. Paramount has set a March 2 deadline for that, though it could be extended. If Paramount gets a majority of shares, it could shift WBD's course toward its own offer over Netflix's.\n\nThat means Paramount's real deadline for submitting its best offer is weeks away, though the company could raise its bid well before that. If Paramount raises its offer, Netflix will have four days to respond.\n\nWBD has said it prefers Netflix's all-cash offer of $27.75 per share for its studio and streaming assets over Paramount's proposal of $30 per share for the entire company, including its cable TV networks.\n\nWBD warned last week that if it went with Paramount, its employees could quit in droves, ahead of what could be a major round of layoffs under Ellison. Paramount has said it plans to create $6 billion in cost savings, which would include layoffs, compared to $2 billion or $3 billion from Netflix.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix is the biggest threat to Hollywood since it has the most streaming subscribers and dominates viewership share among paid streamers. Netflix's counterargument is that it also competes against YouTube and other free streamers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is another variable. Trump said in December that Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem\" due to its market share, before saying in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the regulatory process.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nThen on Saturday, Trump said Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\" On a podcast, Rice, a former senior White House official under Obama and Biden, criticized the Trump administration and companies that \"take a knee\" under pressure from the president.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos shrugged off the president's remarks on Monday, saying that the streaming titan's bid for Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "description": "Governance watchers say Susan Rice's critique of Donald Trump is complicating Netflix's bid for Warner Bros., while others call her stance principled.",
    "fullText": "A corporate board seat can bring status and stock awards — and also political heat.\n\nThe criticism that Netflix board member Susan Rice leveled at President Donald Trump last week is dividing governance watchers over how political a corporate director can afford to be.\n\nRice, who served in top roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, made several critical remarks about the commander in chief during an appearance on the podcast \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara.\" Trump responded by demanding that Netflix remove her from her seat \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nThe spat has come at a precarious time for the video-streaming company. Netflix's pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery— an $82.7 billion bid — could reshape Hollywood, but it requires approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nWhile Rice's actions didn't break any laws, governance experts who spoke with Business Insider were split over whether she crossed a line.\n\nDirectors would be wise to keep their personal views about politics and other sensitive topics out of the public eye, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Their fiduciary responsibility is to serve in the company's best interests, and Rice's remarks ran counter to that duty, he said.\n\n\"It's poor judgment. And you're elected as a director for your judgment,\" Elson said. \"She has to ask herself, 'Am I a public figure or am I a corporate director?'\"\n\nElson, himself a director, said he avoids publicly staking out political positions. \"I just don't think it's in my lane,\" he said.\n\nTrump's threat of retaliation, however, didn't align with the kind of conduct normally expected of a sitting president, either, said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\n\"It's really important to recognize that what Susan Rice was calling out is exactly the behavior that Trump responded with,\" she said. \"Trump's reaction just points out how important what she has to say is.\"\n\nRice spoke critically of Trump at length on the podcast, suggesting her remarks were intentional rather than off the cuff.\n\n\"This might have felt like the hill that she was ready to die on, metaphorically,\" added Pozner. \"It's definitely risky for her politically. It's definitely risky for the Netflix deal, but it also seems like such a principled stance that it ought to be respected by most people.\"\n\nRice, Netflix, and the White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt is possible that Rice warned Netflix's leadership about the podcast and got its blessing behind the scenes. Ted Sarandos, the company's co-CEO, referred to its bid for Warner Bros. as a \"business deal\" on the BBC's Today program on Monday. \"It's not a political deal,\" he said.\n\nStill, Rice's public and partisan tongue-lashing is unusual for a director on a major corporate board. It could make companies reconsider whether to put political figures on their boards, Elson said.\n\n\"Obviously, someone coming out of public service has a lot of experience, a lot of intelligence,\" said Elson. But, he added, \"Are you retired or not?\"\n\nThe incident could further discourage corporate leaders from speaking their minds in public, said Pozner. The president has repeatedly targeted critics, publicly calling for boycotts of companies and attacking business figures who challenge him.\n\n\"I think it will have a dampening effect on public speech,\" said Pozner.\n\nGovernance experts say the incident should serve as a case study for corporate boardrooms.\n\n\"Every company in America that has a pending regulatory approval should be watching the case,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International.\n\n\"The lesson isn't: Don't have political opinions. The lesson is: Understand when your company is at peak vulnerability and govern that accordingly. … Time really does matter.\"\n\nCompanies may be able to prevent directors from causing a similar kerfuffle, said Akubuiro, by enacting quiet periods during sensitive moments. These would be similar to how leaders are expected to clam up in the weeks leading up to companies' quarterly earnings reports.\n\n\"You just want to recognize that in a politicized moment, anything that's quasi-political can become a weapon, and folks will use that against you for maximum leverage,\" Akubuiro said.\n\nSimilarly, companies need defined communication policies that set expectations for directors, especially when regulatory stakes are high, and outline what to do if a board member goes off script, said Jennifer Schielke, CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions.\n\n\"The boardroom should be designed for robust dissent that is productive and private,\" she said.\n\nIn a fractious political environment, it's prudent for board members to get counsel and to consider the potential costs and benefits of what they say, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nYet, she added, \"That is completely different from being cowed into not saying anything.\"\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "The head of Netflix has responded publicly for the first time to President Donald Trump's calls for it to remove Susan Rice from its board.\n\n\"This is a business deal. It's not a political deal,\" Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, told the BBC's Today program on Monday, referring to the company's bid to buy Warner Bros. \"This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the US, and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.\"\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump called on Netflix to fire Rice, a former US ambassador and national security advisor in the Obama and Biden administrations, from its board of directors.\n\nTrump was responding to comments Rice made in a podcast about corporations that \"take a knee to Trump,\" warning that they could face retribution from a future Democratic administration.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC how big a deal it was for the president to weigh in on Rice, Sarandos said: \"He likes to do a lot of things on social media.\"\n\nIt comes at a delicate time for Netflix, which is battling Paramount to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. A deal would require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump had said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal. But that changed over the weekend, with the president writing that Netflix should remove Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka called Trump's demands an \"extraordinary use of power\" and said it's a reminder that the White House would be involved in the future of Warner Bros., regardless of what Trump is saying at any given moment.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Sarandos said his pitch to Trump for Netflix's Warner Bros. bid is \"growth in the economy.\"\n\nHe said that Netflix's deal is a \"vertical merger\" in which the company is buying assets it doesn't already have, and so it will be \"adding to the market.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is seeking to buy Warner Bros. streaming and studio assets, Paramount is looking to buy all of the company.\n\nThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery earlier gave Paramount a seven-day window to submit a new offer, which expires at the end of Monday.\n\nOn February 17, WBD told shareholders that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that the bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal. The company's previous bid in December was for $30 per share.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump demanded that Netflix \"immediately terminate\" Rice from its board of directors, \"or pay the consequences,\" amplifying a message from right-wing activist Laura Loomer.

    "fullText": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump is all business as the Department of Justice weighs the streaming giant's potential acquisition of Warner Bros.\n\n\"The only thing we talk about is how to keep jobs in America, how to keep the production industry healthy,\" Sarandos said of his talks with Trump during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast.\n\nTrump \"wants to know what happened in California,\" Sarandos said in the podcast episode, referencing the state's film and TV production decline.\n\nHollywood has increasingly gone outside Los Angeles to make movies and shows in recent years, lured by tax credits in places ranging from Atlanta to the United Kingdom.\n\nOn-location shooting days for movies and TV shows in the LA area fell 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to a study from FilmLA Research published in mid-January. This production drop has hurt LA's creative community.\n\nTrump previously floated the idea of imposing tariffs on movies and shows made outside the US, though it's unclear how an import tax could apply to creative services.\n\nNetflix has been on a charm campaign to convince the president and Hollywood that it would be a better buyer of Warner Bros. than rival bidder Paramount Skydance.\n\nA key part of Netflix's pitch is that it would cut fewer jobs than Paramount. Paramount has said it's planning to create $6 billion in so-called synergies, which would likely include layoffs, while Netflix has told investors it's aiming for $2 billion to $3 billion in cost cuts, in part by saving money on licensing programming.\n\nWBD's board of directors seems sympathetic to Netflix's argument. The board warned shareholders that if it accepted Paramount's offer, there could be an exodus of employees seeking to avoid layoffs.\n\nAntitrust analysis often focuses on how strong a company is relative to its competitors and how the market power it could wield over consumers. Regulators also look at how a merger or acquisition would impact the production side, which in this case would be how many studios are competing to buy new movies or shows.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix, the largest paid streaming service with over 325 million subscribers, would become too powerful if it bought the Warner Bros. studio and HBO assets. Netflix has downplayed those concerns, saying that it also competes against YouTube and traditional TV for attention.\n\nTrump said in December that Netflix had a \"very big market share\" so buying Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\" However, the president said in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" and would defer to his Department of Justice.\n\n\"We do not discuss private conversations that may or may not have happened, but President Trump has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nNetflix's co-CEO said Trump hadn't asked him for political concessions relating to the Warner Bros deal.\n\n\"We're not talking about doing anybody any favors or anything else,\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos has long donated to Democrats, and Netflix is often seen by Republicans as a left-leaning company, as evidenced by the grilling Sarandos got during his visit to Capitol Hill in early February.\n\nNotably, Paramount is run by David Ellison and is financially backed by his father, Larry Ellison, a mega-billionaire who has long supported Trump. The younger Ellison has also built rapport with Trump, as the president said last year that Paramount's CEO was \"great\" and would \"do a great job\" running the Hollywood institution.\n\nIf Trump doesn't pick a side, however, those relationships may not help the Ellisons win the battle for Warner Bros.",

    "fullText": "Larry and David Ellison are getting another shot to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe media conglomerate announced Tuesday that it will let the Ellisons make another bid for the company over the next week, with two key stipulations: Their offer has to be more than $31 for each share of WBD, and it will be the last time the Ellisons get to make a formal pitch to the WBD board.\n\nWBD's announcement reopens a deal that was theoretically closed last December, when it agreed to sell most of itself to Netflix in an $83 billion transaction.\n\nSince then, the Ellisons, who bought Paramount last year and want to merge it with WBD, have argued that their offer of $30 per share — for the entire company — was better than Netflix's offer.\n\nThey have repeatedly told WBD and its investors that they should get another shot at making their case. Their most recent pitch came a week ago, when they offered to pay billions \n\nNow, WBD says, they have one more opportunity to bid. WBD says they expect the Ellisons to increase their offer to more than $31 a share. The company is trading around $28 a share, up 170% in the last year.\n\nIn a press release, WBD officials say that last week, a \"senior representative\" for Paramount told them that if they had the chance to bid, they would offer $31 per share, but could go above that.\n\nNone of this means the existing deal Netflix has with WBD goes away. For starters, WBD continues to formally endorse its Netflix deal. More important: If Paramount does increase its bid, Netflix will have the ability to raise its offer, too.\n\nAnd no matter what bid WBD eventually agrees to, the deal will still need regulatory approval in the US and overseas. Netflix got a preview of some of the issues regulators might bring up earlier this month during a congressional hearing, when Republicans argued that the company is too woke, and Democrats worried that a combined Netflix/WBD could doom the movie industry.\n\nA Paramount/WBD combination would also get regulatory scrutiny, though the Ellisons are counting on their ties to the Trump White House to give them a leg up.",

    "description": "Netflix made streaming movies at home a big part of its pitch. Now, as it tries to buy Warner Bros. and its giant movie business, things are changing.",
    "fullText": "Netflix spent a lot of time arguing that the future of movies was watching them at home, not in theaters.\n\nNow Netflix wants to buy a movie studio that puts movies into theaters. So it's started saying that watching movies in theaters is good, sometimes.\n\nThat's the messaging Netflix has been trying to make ever since it announced plans to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in December. But that messaging hasn't been satisfying to some people who care a lot about the future of movies in theaters.\n\nWhich is why Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos appeared in The New York Times on Friday, talking about how much he likes the business of putting movies into theaters. Again, it's an idea he's been talking about since he announced the (proposed) Netflix/WBD deal on December 5.\n\nSarandos did say one thing he thinks is new and important: A commitment to keep all future Warner Bros. movies in theaters for at least 45 days:\n\nThat 45-day commitment won't mean much to most people. But Sarandos definitely thinks it matters — \"I'm giving you a hard number.\"\n\nThe very abbreviated backstory: Sarandos and Netflix have spent years fighting the idea of a theatrical \"window\" — the amount of time movies spend exclusively in theaters before they move to platforms like streaming services, rentals, and purchases. Their general argument: If people want to watch movies at home — that is, on Netflix — they should get to do that.\n\nNetflix has periodically had to soften that stance to accommodate high-profile movies and talent, which is why you could see Martin Scorcese's \"The Irishman\" in theaters for a few weeks before it came to Netfix in 2019, and why \"Barbie\" director Gretg Gerwig's \"Narnia\" will be in Imax theaters for a couple weeks this fall before it comes to Netflix. Netflix has also periodically debated its streaming-only/mostly stance internally.\n\nBut externally, Sarandos has been a huge promoter of the idea that the future of movies is at home — which happens to align with the fact that moviegoing has been in decline for years. That's not just because of Netflix, but because the internet gives people lots of other things to do besides going to theaters.\n\nNow, as he prepares to buy WBD, Sarandos has had to change his tune. The shortest version of his new one: We weren't in the business of putting movies into theaters, but if we buy WBD, we will be, so we'll do that.\n\nBut that hasn't convinced lots of people that a business built on streaming is going to become one that cares about theaters.\n\nIn part, that's because Sarandos also said things like \"our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members because that's what they're looking for,\" when announcing the deal. He's also said he hopes \"windows will evolve to be much more consumer-friendly to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker\" — which reasonable people believe means he intends for movies to spend less time in theaters.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount, the Hollywood studio that would like to buy WBD instead, has made a commitment to putting movies in theaters, and honoring \"healthy traditional windows\" as part of its talking points.\n\nSo now, Sarandos has planted a 45-day flag. Whether that mollifies Hollywood or anyone else is an open question.",

    "fullText": "David Ellison's Paramount Skydance just suffered another setback, this time in its legal fight with Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nA Delaware judge ruled against Paramount, which had sued WBD in hopes of getting a court order forcing its acquisition target to quickly release information about how the company valued its cable networks.\n\nThe value of WBD's cable TV networks is a key difference between Paramount's and Netflix's rival bids. Paramount wants to buy them while Netflix does not.\n\nParamount's effort was unsuccessful, as the Delaware Court of Chancery's Morgan Zurn ruled against Paramount's motion for a summary judgment seeking expedited discovery on Thursday morning.\n\n\"Paramount has not shown it will suffer cognizable irreparable harm if expedition is not granted,\" Zurn said in her ruling.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson said in a statement that the company \"continues to urge WBD to make these disclosures so that WBD shareholders can make an informed decision.\"\n\nWBD said in a statement that the company was pleased the court \"rejected the notion that this lawsuit needed special treatment and may have other serious flaws.\"\n\nParamount has made eight offers to buy WBD, which have been rejected by WBD's board of directors in favor of its Netflix deal. However, Paramount still thinks its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD, including its cable networks like CNN, is superior to Netflix's cash-and-stock bid of $27.75 per share for WBD's studio and HBO assets.\n\nSince Netflix does not want to buy WBD's cable TV networks, their value could determine whether WBD shareholders choose Paramount's rival, hostile bid. Paramount hoped the court would require WBD to disclose how it valued its cable channels.\n\n\"For stockholders to understand the difference between those two transactions, they need certain basic information that they don't have today,\" Quinn Emanuel lawyer Mike Barlow said on behalf of Paramount. Barlow argued WBD's shareholders \"are being harmed\" every day that they don't have WBD's valuation of its TV networks.\n\nWBD's legal team — led by Ryan McLeod from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz — said there was \"zero emergency\" to disclose WBD's valuation of its cable assets and \"no threat\" of clear, irreparable harm to Paramount that required it to immediately release that information.\n\nMcLeod, from WBD's team, argued that there wasn't a rush for WBD to disclose how it valued its cable networks, saying that Paramount's January 21 deadline for WBD shareholders to give Paramount control of their shares was an arbitrary date that could easily be moved.\n\nTo that point, Paramount's Barlow said that the company \"fully intends to extend this tender offer,\" which would give WBD shareholders more time to decide whether to tender their shares.\n\nJudge Zurn ruled in WBD's favor, reasoning that \"Paramount as a stockholder was not misled by any omissions\" from WBD, since Ellison's company wasn't deciding whether to take its own offer.",

    "fullText": "David Ellison has chosen to continue the fight for control of Warner Bros. Discovery, this time in court.\n\nThe Paramount Skydance CEO has made eight attempts to buy WBD, all of which have been rebuffed. That includes his most recent $30-per-share bid, which was spurned in favor of Netflix's offer. Paramount is attempting to acquire the entire company, including its TV networks, such as CNN, TBS, and TNT. Netflix's cash-and-stock offer is $27.75 per share for just WBD's studio and streaming assets.\n\nNow, Paramount is suing WBD \n\nIf WBD's Global Networks business — the division that houses its cable TV networks — is worth substantially less than $2.25 per share, then Paramount's $30-per-share bid could look more attractive to shareholders than Netflix's proposal. Paramount has argued that WBD's cable channels have a $0-per-share equity value, implying they're worth about as much as the estimated $15 billion in debt that WBD intends to saddle them with.\n\n\"WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its 'risk adjustment' of our $30 per share all-cash offer,\" Ellison wrote to WBD investors.\n\nParamount is also initiating a so-called proxy fight where it tries to get representatives on WBD's board of directors.\n\nFor now, Paramount isn't raising the price of its bid. Instead, it is sticking with its all-cash, $30-per-share proposal in hopes that WBD shareholders will see something the board doesn't.\n\n\"WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount,\" Ellison wrote. \"But what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer.\"\n\nParamount appears to be set on finding ways it can win control of WBD without paying more money in a renewed bidding war.\n\n\"Paramount will continue to use all avenues to wrestle WBD away from Netflix,\" said Ross Benes, an analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. \"Lawsuits, shareholder appeals, proxy battles, and so on, individually have little chance of swinging the merger. These tactics are part of a broader strategy to keep pressing until something gives and then seizing on that opportunity.\"\n\nRead Ellison's full letter to WBD shareholders:\n\nDear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder,\n\nOver the last few days, following the decision by Warner Bros. Discovery (\"WBD\") not to engage with Paramount on our $30 per share cash offer to acquire all of WBD, and our reaffirmation of our commitment to delivering our superior offer to WBD shareholders, we keep getting the same question: what happens next?\n\nParamount started this process about four months ago with a private offer at a significant premium to WBD's $12.54 share price, and our pursuit culminated in the $30 per share all-cash, fully financed proposal we made before WBD entered into the Netflix transaction. When we learned of the terms of that transaction, which are inferior both financially and from the standpoint of timing and certainty of closing, we decided to bring our offer directly to you, through our tender offer.\n\nWe are committed to seeing our tender offer through. We understand, however, that unless the WBD board of directors decides to exercise its right to engage with us under the Netflix merger agreement (the \"Netflix Agreement\"), this will likely come down to your vote at a shareholder meeting. We do not know whether that will be at WBD's upcoming annual meeting or a special meeting. The \"advance notice\" window for WBD's 2026 annual meeting opens in three weeks, and Paramount will nominate a slate of directors who, in accordance with their fiduciary duties, will exercise WBD's right under the Netflix Agreement to engage on Paramount's offer and enter into a transaction with Paramount. In addition, Paramount will propose an amendment to WBD's bylaws to require WBD shareholder approval for any separation of Global Networks. If WBD calls a special meeting ahead of its annual meeting to vote on the Netflix Agreement, Paramount will solicit proxies against such approval. These actions, coupled with our tender offer, ensure that you get the final decision on which offer is better for you.\n\nWBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer. Our $30 per share in cash is simply more than Netflix's complex multi-variable consideration comprised of (a) $23.25 in cash plus (b) a number of Netflix shares currently worth $4.11 (at Friday's close) plus (c) the to-be-issued Global Networks equity which we have analyzed as having zero equity value1. In addition to not disclosing the value of the to-be-issued Global Networks spin off, WBD has not disclosed the mechanism by which any debt transferred from Global Networks to the Streaming & Studios segment reduces the cash and stock consideration payable to you.\n\nAlong with the WBD shareholders, we have asked for the customary financial disclosure a board is supposed to provide shareholders when making an investment recommendation. But in each of its 14D-9 filings, WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its \"risk adjustment\" of our $30 per share all-cash offer. WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer — and importantly, Delaware law has consistently required that such information be provided to shareholders. Following the process prescribed under Delaware law, we filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer.\n\nWe do not undertake any of these actions lightly. Make no mistake, our goal remains to have constructive discussions with WBD's Board to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of WBD shareholders. Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders. We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our December 4th offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us. Even as we read WBD's own narrative of its process, we are struck that there were few actual board meetings in the period leading up to the decision to accept an inferior transaction with Netflix. And we are surprised by the lack of transparency on WBD's part regarding basic financial matters. It just doesn't add up — much like the math on how WBD continues to favor taking less than our $30 per share all-cash offer for its shareholders.\n\nThe best outcome for you and for us would be if WBD's Board would exercise the right it has under the Netflix Agreement to engage with Paramount. If it does so, we will be open and constructive to secure the best path forward for WBD and each of you. We have demonstrated our willingness to listen carefully to any feedback we receive from WBD's Board and to respond by offering reasonable solutions — and that remains our mindset and approach.\n\nI believe in our vision for how we can bring these great companies together and deliver for consumers, the creative community and of course, for you. Paramount is committed, my family is committed, and hopefully this helps answer the question of what comes next.\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance is still trying to stop Warner Bros. Discovery's Netflix deal. Here are the four most likely endings in the fight for WBD.",
    "fullText": "The war for Warner Bros. Discovery is getting intense.\n\nParamount Skydance isn't surrendering in its quest to buy WBD, even though its offers have been rejected eight times in favor of Netflix's bid.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison has criticized WBD for not selecting what he's called \"by far the superior offer.\"\n\nWBD has fired back, accusing Paramount of threatening lawsuits and leaking to the press. The company's board of directors said this week in a letter to shareholders that Paramount \"has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction.\"\n\nThere have been many twists and turns in Netflix and Paramount's battle for WBD, and the drama isn't over yet.\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios that could unfold.\n\nAlthough Paramount says its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD provides more value and less risk than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets, the company could up the ante.\n\nSeveral media insiders, including Disney's former top dealmaker, expect a renewed bidding war for WBD.\n\nTheir view got a boost when Paramount disclosed in a filing that Ellison had texted WBD CEO David Zaslav, saying that Paramount's $30-per-share proposal wasn't its \"best and final\" offer.\n\nWBD investors also seem to be counting on more fireworks, given that its stock is trading north of $28.50, close to $1 per share above Netflix's agreed-upon purchase price. That suggests shareholders believe either Ellison and company or Netflix will fork over more money before WBD changes hands.\n\nParamount might not need to offer another penny if a majority of WBD's shareholders tender their shares, which would put pressure on the board to reconsider its proposal.\n\nAs a public company, WBD's leadership is legally required to act in the best interests of its shareholders. Otherwise, its board could be sued. So, if WBD's investors overwhelmingly prefer Paramount's bid, the board could have no choice but to go with it.\n\nHowever, Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners, thinks Paramount won't convince a majority of WBD shareholders to tender their shares. Greenfield predicted that Paramount would then raise its offer to $32 per share, but that Netflix would respond by sweetening its offer, leading to Paramount eventually dropping its bid.\n\nUntil the Netflix deal closes, a competing proposal could come in, since WBD is a public company. Comcast drove up the eventual price of Disney's acquisition of Fox's studio by nearly $20 billion, even though its rival bid came in six months later.\n\nIf Paramount remains adamant that it has a superior proposal that wasn't chosen, it could sue WBD's board of directors, alleging negligence.\n\nWBD has acknowledged that possibility. Paramount \"has been aggressive in its engagement with WBD, has retained litigation counsel and has threatened litigation,\" WBD's board of directors wrote in a letter on Wednesday in which it rejected Paramount's latest offer.\n\nLawyer Raul Gastesi of Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella has taken note of Paramount's litigious posture and said that now that it has been turned down, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit.\"\n\nHowever, Reuben Miller, the head of antitrust at data intelligence firm Dealreporter, said that while Paramount is making waves in the court of public opinion, he believes they \"would rather come with an increased offer and avoid litigation than roll the dice in Delaware court.\"\n\nEven if Paramount decides not to sue, there's a chance WBD shareholders could take legal action against WBD's board.\n\nWhile Paramount has taken a hands-on approach to its WBD bid so far, it could let the chips fall and move on if its proposal doesn't win over enough WBD shareholders.\n\nInstead of spending more than $100 billion on WBD, Paramount could put money toward another acquisition, or simply invest in improving its technology and original content.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's leveraged buyout bid again, citing financial and litigation risk",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board raised its hackles on Wednesday while rejecting Paramount Skydance's bid for the eighth time in favor of Netflix's offer.\n\nWBD used pointed language, calling Paramount's bid the \"largest leveraged buyout in history by a wide margin\" and tying its potential failure to previous big LBOs that didn't close on the initially agreed-upon terms.\n\nIn its new filing, WBD also described Paramount's financial condition as \"not strong,\" noting that its credit was already rated \"junk\" by S&P before the \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" required by the deal. Paramount, for its part, has emphasized that $40.4 billion in equity of its new bid is fully backstopped by Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nWBD's strong language suggests that the board and leadership \"just want to move on,\" and the \"largest LBO\" angle is a new and compelling one, Wharton M&A professor Paul Nary said on X.\n\nDavid Zaslav-led WBD also ramped up its accusations that Paramount has acted litigiously and leaked to the press.\n\nIn the filing, WBD cited new press reports in the New York Post indicating Paramount was considering abandoning its offer and might pursue \"DefCon 1\" litigation against WBD's board. WBD said that Paramount didn't deny the reports, suggesting that the company was leaking to the press. WBD had previously complained that there had been \"extensive media leaks and rumors\" about Paramount's proposals.\n\nM&A experts said the stepped-up language was likely drafted in anticipation of a lawsuit against WBD, either by Paramount or WBD shareholders.\n\nNow that Paramount has lost to Netflix, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit,\" said Raul Gastesi, a partner at Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella.\n\nCorey Martin, managing partner of Granderson Des Rochers, a law firm focused on entertainment and media, said the new filing felt calibrated to deter WBD shareholders from backing Paramount's hostile bid.\n\n\"The audience is really the shareholders, because there's always the risk of shareholder lawsuits,\" Martin said. \"It is colorful stuff, but Paramount's is a hostile bid.\"\n\nMartin also saw the emphasis on legal and press tactics as part of a PR strategy to portray Paramount as a bad actor, as well as a pre-litigation tactic.\n\nLightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a note on Wednesday that Paramount could still outbid Netflix, but it would \"require an overhaul of their current bid, and a dramatic increase in the cash invested from the Ellison family and/or their friends and financing partners.\"",

That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts. If you haven't had a chance to pick up Hogwarts Legacy yet, it is available on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was one of the more important RPGs ever made due to its revolutionary open world map and quest design, two core pillars of Hogwarts Legacy. While you can still play the original, Oblivion Remastered is a better product in almost every single way. The 2006 masterpiece has been completely remastered, featuring overhauled graphics, character models, dialogue, and mechanics. The core game is still intact, though, as you start your adventure on an epic quest to uncover the mystery of why your emperor was murdered.\n\nAlong the way, you'll encounter five distinct guilds, each with its own questlines, several sprawling cities teeming with life, and an open world that features dozens of unique locations. Also, if you're a fan of the magical combat in Hogwarts Legacy, Oblivion Remastered lets you become a full-blown mage who can use a variety of different magic attacks. It doesn't officially support them, but a collection of Oblivion Remastered mods have also begun to pop up that can further improve the experience.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising is an action-adventure game in the mold of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that places a large emphasis on combat, but still has many qualities that appeal to Hogwarts Legacy fans. You'll get to explore the world right from the start of the game, and when you're not fighting enemies, you can solve a number of challenging puzzles that lead to rewards or other areas within the world. As for combat, you'll get to challenge mythological beasts such as Medusa as well as a plethora of other smaller enemies. The combat in Immortals Fenyx Rising is quite faster than in Hogwarts Legacy, but it's easy to pick up once you understand the controls.\n\nIf the lore and story were your favorite parts about Hogwarts Legacy, then why not hop over to another beloved pop culture franchise? Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an original story in the Star Wars universe that takes place between the events of the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy movies. It's a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but you don't need to play that game to understand what's happening in Survivor.\n\nThe game continues to follow protagonist Cal Kestis as he attempts to lead a rebellion against the Empire with a band of outlaws. Survivor sees you visit several planets that are somewhat open world and all have different enemies to face, puzzles to solve, and collectibles to find. As you progress, you'll unlock more attack types, including additional Force abilities and lightsaber forms. The combat in Survivor can be fairly difficult, especially against the late-game bosses, but you have plenty of tools at your disposal to take down enemies. For newer video game players, you can simply set the difficulty level to its lowest setting and take in one of the best Star Wars tales told in recent memory.\n\nLA Noire might not be the first game you think of when you think of Hogwarts Legacy. However, the two games have \n\nIf you enjoyed the outskirt areas of Hogwarts Legacy that extended beyond the castle grounds, then Ghost of Tsushima might be right up your alley. This open-world RPG is set in 13th-century Japan during the Mongol invasion and features extremely detailed and beautiful landscapes outside of the war-torn towns and fields. Ghost of Tsushima sees you play as a samurai who's trying to navigate the invasion and protect their island from the Mongols. When you're not actively doing story missions, you can explore a huge world filled with real-life locations that are still standing in Japan today. You'll come across your fair share of enemies while exploring, but the combat in Ghosts of Tsushima is beginner-friendly while still being difficult to master as you unlock more weapons and skills. A sequel, Ghost of Yotei, is on the way in 2025.\n\nThe Horizon series features perhaps the closest games to Hogwarts Legacy. The first game in the series is Horizon Zero Dawn, but you can also play its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, for an equally thrilling adventure. We recommend playing Zero Dawn first, though, as there's so much lore you need to understand before you can fully appreciate Forbidden West.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, you play as Aloy, an orphan born in the midst of a post-apocalyptic period in an alternate version of the United States in the 31st century. In this version of the US, man-made machines have taken over the planet, and tribes of hunter-gatherers and warriors try to survive without antagonizing them. Throughout Zero Dawn, you'll uncover the origins of Aloy's story, which is deeply entangled with how this future came to be and what happened to the humans before the machines took over. It's an epic adventure with a huge open world, combat centered around a bow and arrow, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe Dragon Age franchise is one that Hogwarts Legacy fans should find enjoyable. They're RPGs with an emphasis on narrative elements and exploration through a large, open world. There's also plenty of magic at play, both in combat and with basic mechanics. In The Veilguard, you play as Rook, who's tasked with stopping a pair of corrupt gods who have escaped their imprisonment. At the beginning of the game, you'll be by yourself, but over time, you can recruit a number of companions to join your party and fight alongside you for the duration of the adventure. Magic, an open world, and a mysterious story all make Dragon Age: The Veilguard an enticing option for any Hogwarts fan. You also don't have to play any of the original Dragon Age games to understand the story, so feel free to hop right in regardless of your experience.\n\nSpeaking of a franchise with some deep lore, the Marvel universe is a natural stepping stone for any Hogwarts Legacy player to dive into. While some fantastic Marvel games have been released in the past several years, Spider-Man was the game that marked Marvel's revival in the video game industry. This is an original story for the webbed hero that follows Peter Parker trying to navigate a day job while also being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The story starts off relatively slow, but develops into a thriller with all sorts of twists and turns.\n\nThe setting for Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world New York City, and swinging through its skyscrapers or Central Park is one of the best feelings you can experience in a video game. The swinging mechanics along with the Arkham-style combat are thoroughly crisp, leading you to feel like you really are Spider-Man.\n\nIf puzzles were one of your favorite parts of Hogwarts Legacy, but you still want some exploration, then look no further than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Breath of the Wild is one of the most celebrated video games of all time, combining a staggeringly massive open world with fantastic puzzles that actually require you to use different parts of your console to solve. Some puzzles can simply be solved using the joysticks on your Switch, while others use the console's gyro controls and both Joy-Cons. The puzzles can be surprisingly difficult to get through, but they might not even be the hardest part of the game.\n\nInstead, the combat and gear degradation systems in Breath of the Wild will likely have you more challenged than the puzzles. Combat can be difficult if you run into a boss or enemy that outlevels you, but even easy fights have the potential to turn difficult if your favorite sword breaks from too much use. While all of this sounds overly challenging, Breath of the Wild allows you to play at your own pace, and players of all skill levels can pick it up and immediately enjoy what it has to offer. An enhanced Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and its excellent sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, are out now and boast some very nice upgrades.\n\nNow, your first thought when you see a game like Baldur's Gate 3 might be that you're not a fan of turn-based combat. After all, if you liked Hogwarts Legacy, going from fast-paced wand fights to slow, turn-based moves in every encounter could be jarring. However, if you can get past the shift to turn-based combat and really sink your teeth into Baldur's Gate 3, you'll discover why it's considered one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is an epic tale of your character, who can either be a preset character or completely your design, trying to stop an alien force from taking over an entire continent's minds. The game isn't necessarily open world, as it features distinct zones that are a part of the different story acts, but the zones themselves are very large. Within these zones, you'll be able to pick up new party members, who you can completely control, go on winding side quests that feel like their own mini-story, and explore the beautiful and dangerous landscapes that make up each one of the maps. Baldur's Gate 3 also features cross-play and is fully co-op, so you can partake in the adventure with a friend or two.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed franchise is somewhat divisive, as many fans seem to either love or hate the different styles of games in the series. If you were to pick one to play to scratch your Hogwarts Legacy itch, though, make it Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in 400 BC Greece, Odyssey sees you take control of either a male or female protagonist who comes from humble beginnings. However, over the course of the game, you'll take part in a war between Athens and Sparta, command a ship across high seas, and explore perhaps the biggest open-world map on this list. The story in Odyssey has a few different branches that all clash by the end of the 50-hour-plus campaign, and it's one of the most memorable in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Hogwarts Legacy fans should find the combat easy to pick up, and exploration on a much larger scale than they find in the Wizarding World.\n\nFable III is one of the few games on this list that's somewhat difficult to play in 2025. However, if you're subscribed to Game Pass, then you shouldn't have any trouble on Xbox or PC. Fable III is the most recent game in the Fable series, but the next entry, currently known simply as Fable, is coming sometime in 2026. The Fable series is widely beloved in the gaming community thanks to the charm of its characters and gameplay. Fable III specifically sees you embark on a quest to take down an unruly leader and manage the kingdom for the people of your country.\n\nWhile the story in Fable III isn't especially long, it does offer you a plethora of choices to make that drastically impact how the narrative plays out. During your adventure in the main story, you'll come across a slew of combat engagements, which play out in real time and feature melee, ranged, and magic attacks. The combat can be a little clunky in Fable III, but the world and characters will keep you enthralled throughout the entire game.\n\nIf we're recommending games like Hogwarts Legacy, let's go with one of the only other Wizarding World titles on the market that's easily playable in 2025. Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 allows you to play through the first four years of the Harry Potter series as Harry himself. You'll get to explore a slimmed-down version of Hogwarts Castle and meet the cast of characters that you know and love. The game doesn't play out exactly like the movies or books, so there will be some different events that take place. Of course, you'll still get to partake in the classic Harry Potter events, such as playing Quidditch, sneaking around after dark, and even battling the Basilisk. Given the Lego nature of these games, they're meant to appeal to a more casual gaming audience, but any Harry Potter fan should find something to enjoy in Years 1-4.\n\nLife is Strange is strictly a game for Hogwarts Legacy players who value the story above anything else. Life is Strange doesn't feature any sort of combat or an open-world map to explore. Instead, the game takes place over a series of episodes that follow Max Caulfield, a high school senior who discovers that she can rewind time. Using this ability, Max tries to save her best friend, but altering the past can come with severe consequences. Your job is to find a way to navigate the pitfalls of time travel to try and get as happy an ending as possible. The story is gripping throughout every episode of Life is Strange, and there is some puzzle-solving along the way.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most well-reviewed games ever and easily a top 10 RPG of all time. If the lore and world of Hogwarts Legacy are something that appeals to you, there's arguably no better game to turn to than The Witcher 3. Don't be intimidated by the \"3\" in the title, as it helps to know the lore of the first two games, but it's not imperative whatsoever.\n\nThe Witcher 3 sees you take control of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter who possesses unnatural abilities and strengths. Geralt begins the game on the hunt for his adopted daughter, Ciri, as he's having dreams of an undead army called \"The Wild Hunt\" coming for him and Ciri. While this is the premise of the game, The Witcher 3 is so much more than its initial plotline. The game takes you across an incredibly detailed and large open world where quests and new locations are waiting around every corner. The Witcher 3 even features its own card-based minigame, Gwent, which is now a full-fledged game in its own right.\n\nThe Tomb Raider reboot in 2013 kicked off one of the best gaming trilogies of the modern era. Consisting of Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, these games are extremely well-done and provide you with a very similar experience to that of Hogwarts Legacy. You play as Lara Croft, a world explorer who comes from a wealthy family but finds herself constantly embroiled in some controversies with rival explorers. The Tomb Raider games offer fast-paced and stealthy combat, where you can use a variety of weapons, but you'll also be tasked with solving puzzles, or \"tombs,\" as you progress through the story. With a solid mix of combat, storytelling, and puzzles, you should find yourself right at home as a Hogwarts Legacy fan.\n\nIf you want to step into another established franchise with a cast of iconic characters and villains, then look no further than the Batman Arkham trilogy. Consisting of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, these games revolutionized an entire generation of action-adventure and RPG titles with their \"Arkham-style\" combat. Naturally, you play as Batman in these games, and each title offers a new story for the Caped Crusader. The stories often revolve around the villains of the game, and the second and third titles allow you to explore an open-world Gotham City. While there's crime around every corner in Gotham, there are also puzzles you can solve that are doled out by none other than The Riddler. There's a slice of gameplay for all Hogwarts Legacy fans, but the Arkham games lean more on the side of combat than puzzles.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. is in the middle of a tug-of-war between Netflix and David Ellison’s company, Paramount Skydance.",
    "fullText": "Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is raising the stakes in the battle for Hollywood’s future, personally intervening to salvage his son David Ellison’s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. On Monday, David’s company, Paramount Skydance, announced the elder Ellison had provided an “irrevocable personal guarantee” of $40.4 billion to finance the deal, directly countering claims that the company’s funding was unreliable.​\n\nIt’s the latest turn in the high-profile tug-of-war for Warner Bros. Discovery, one of the entertainment industry’s crown jewels. David Ellison, who became CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance in August, has been aggressively pursuing Warner Bros. with a $108 billion all-cash offer, which comes out to about $30 per share. However, WBD’s board rejected that proposal in favor of a rival agreement to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix for roughly $83 billion.​\n\nThe board’s rejection hinged largely on skepticism regarding the Ellison family’s financing. Last week, WBD directors dismissed Paramount’s funding as “illusory,” citing concerns that the capital was tied to a “revocable family trust” that could be altered or withdrawn before the deal closed. Larry Ellison’s Monday filing was designed to silence those doubts.\n\n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” the company said in a statement, adding that the tech tycoon has agreed “not to revoke the Ellison family trust (which has been operating for nearly 40 years as a counterparty to numerous transactions) or adversely transfer its assets during the pendency of the transaction.”​\n\nThis massive personal commitment—roughly one-sixth of Larry Ellison’s $247.3 billion estimated net worth—effectively removes the WBD board’s primary defense against the takeover. To further sweeten the pot, Paramount raised its proposed breakup fee to $5.8 billion, matching the termination fee included in the rival Netflix offer.​\n\nDavid Ellison argued that his company’s bid remains the only path that preserves Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole entity, rather than selling it off in parts. Netflix’s planned acquisition would exclude WBD’s Global Networks division, which includes CNN and other cable-native brands, and which WBD had previously announced plans to spin off.\n\n“Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on Dec. 4th, and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,” David Ellison said in a statement Monday. “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”​",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount Skydance and CEO David Ellison again. Read WBD's full letter to shareholders.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery still isn't interested in Paramount Skydance's offer.\n\nParamount's latest bid \"is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders\" compared to Netflix's bid, which \"represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders,\" said Samuel Di Piazza, the chair of WBD's board of directors, in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, WBD's board recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's all-cash bid of $30 per share in favor of Netflix's cash-and-stock offer. Paramount wants to buy all of WBD, including its cable channels, while Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share is for WBD's studio, HBO, and HBO Max. A key difference between the two bids revolves around the value of WBD's TV networks, such as CNN and TNT, which Netflix isn't interested in buying.\n\nDi Piazza said that Paramount's seventh proposal \"once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated,\" including about Paramount's financing.\n\nParamount has said its bid is fully backstopped by Larry Ellison, one of the richest people in the world and father to Paramount CEO David Ellison. The WBD board said in the letter to shareholders that it relies \"on an unknown and opaque revocable trust\" whose assets or liabilities are subject to change.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix is paying with cash and stock. Its shares have fallen recently but surged more than 600% from mid-2022 to mid-2025. Netflix has a market cap of over $400 billion.\n\nWhile Paramount has said that it would have an easier time securing regulatory approval than Netflix, the WBD board says it \"does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk\" between the two proposals.\n\nThe Ellisons are close to President Donald Trump. However, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has pitched the president on the deal and seems to have earned some respect. Trump has called Sarandos a \"great person,\" though he added that the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem\" on the regulatory front. Still, the president hasn't come out publicly in favor of one side in the deal.\n\nWBD also said its board \"repeatedly engaged\" with interested parties, including the Ellisons. Paramount had previously said that WBD went quiet late in the bidding process.\n\nNot even Paramount can be surprised by WBD's decision to stick with its Netflix deal.\n\nDavid Ellison was overheard saying last week that if WBD's leadership were to \"accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat's because Paramount said its $30-per-share hostile bid was nearly identical to its previous offer to WBD. Public companies are obligated to act in the best interests of shareholders. So if WBD's board had changed its mind, it could have opened itself up to shareholder lawsuits.\n\nWBD had said in a statement after Paramount's hostile bid that it would \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer\" in a way that was \"consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors.\"\n\nNow that WBD's board has given Paramount the cold shoulder again, it's Ellison's move.\n\nThe aspiring media mogul told CEO David Zaslav that Paramount's latest offer wasn't its \"best and final,\" which suggests that a higher bid could be coming. Just how much appetite Paramount has to escalate the bidding war is the key question.\n\nIf no higher bid comes, WBD's investors have until January 8 to back Paramount, though it could extend that deadline. WBD would owe Netflix a $2.8 billion reverse breakup fee if its shareholders chose Paramount.\n\nRead the full letter to shareholders here:\n\nAs your Board of Directors, we are committed to acting in your best interest. In this spirit, in October, we launched a public review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. This followed three separate proposals from Paramount Skydance (\"PSKY\"), as well as interest from multiple other parties.\n\nThat thorough process, overseen by the Board with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, as well as our management team, led to the company entering into a merger agreement with Netflix on December 4, with the substantial benefits to WBD shareholders described below. Having failed to submit the best proposal for you, our shareholders, PSKY launched an offer nearly identical to its most recently rejected proposal.\n\nAs a Board, we have now conducted another review and determined that PSKY's tender offer remains inferior to the Netflix merger. The Board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix merger, and that you reject the PSKY offer and not tender your shares.\n\nBelow, and in more detail in our 14D-9 filing, we highlight the many reasons for the Board's determination. None of these reasons will be a surprise to PSKY given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals.\n\nThe terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD.\n\nThe value we have secured for shareholders through the Netflix merger is extraordinary by any measure.\n\nOur agreement with Netflix gives WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, plus $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock (based on a collar range of $97.91 - $119.67 in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing), plus the additional value of the shares of Discovery Global and the opportunity to participate in future potential upside following Discovery Global's separation from WBD. The entire Board is confident in our recommendation that Netflix represents the best value-creating path for shareholders.\n\nPSKY has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a \"full backstop\" from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.\n\nPSKY's most recent proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding. Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was — and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming — the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.\n\nAnd a revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder. The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change. As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time. And the documents provided by PSKY for this conditional commitment contain gaps, loopholes and limitations that put you, our shareholders, and our company at risk.\n\nAmplifying the concerns about the credibility of the equity commitment being offered by PSKY, the revocable trust and PSKY have agreed that the trust's liability for damages, even in the case of a willful breach, would be capped at 7% of its commitment ($2.8 billion on a $108.4 billion transaction). Of course, the damage to WBD and its stockholders were the trust or PSKY to breach their obligations to close a transaction would likely be many multiples of this amount.\n\nWBD's merger agreement with Netflix is a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments. The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet. The debt financing for the PSKY bid relies on an unsecure revocable trust commitment as well as the credit worthiness of a $15 billion market cap company with a credit rating at or only a notch above \"junk\" status from the two leading rating agencies. The financial condition and creditworthiness of PSKY, which, if its proposed transaction were to close, would have a high gross leverage ratio of 6.8x 2026E debt to EBITDA with virtually no current free cash flow generation before synergies, raise substantial risks for its acquisition of WBD. Such debt levels reflect a risky capital structure that is vulnerable to even potentially small changes in the PSKY or WBD business between signing and closing.\n\nAdditionally, PSKY contemplates $9 billion in synergies from the mergers of Paramount/Skydance and their offer for WBD. These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.\n\nThe Board's review was full, transparent and comprehensive — establishing a level playing field that fostered a rigorous and fair process.\n\nThe Board repeatedly engaged with all parties, including extensive engagement with PSKY and its advisors over the course of nearly three months. We held dozens of calls and meetings with its principals and advisors including four in-person meetings and meals between David Zaslav and David and/or Larry Ellison and provided multiple opportunities for PSKY to offer a proposal that was superior to those of the other bidders, which PSKY never did.\n\nAfter each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions. Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.\n\nDespite PSKY's media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.\n\nThe Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the PSKY offer with its regulatory advisors. The Board believes that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material. The Board also notes that Netflix has agreed to a record-setting regulatory termination cash fee of $5.8 billion, significantly higher than PSKY's $5 billion break fee.\n\nThe offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion; it is not the same thing as a binding merger agreement. The first paragraph of the offer states it is \"subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time)\" and continues on the next page, \"we reserve the right to amend the Offer in any respect (including amending the Offer Price)\". In addition, the offer is not capable of being completed by its current expiration date, due to the need for, among other things, global regulatory approvals, which PSKY indicates may take 12-18 months. Nothing in this structure offers WBD shareholders any deal certainty.\n\nThe PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders.\n\nThere will be additional costs associated with PSKY's offer that could impact shareholders.\n\nWhen considering the PSKY offer at this juncture, it is important to note that its acceptance could incur significant additional costs to shareholders — all of which PSKY has ignored in their communications. WBD would have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee, which PSKY has not offered to reimburse. In addition, WBD would incur approximately $1.5 billion in financing costs if we do not complete our planned debt exchange as agreed to with certain of our debtholders, which would not be permitted by the PSKY offer. This additional $4.3 billion in potential costs represents approximately $1.66 per share to be borne by WBD shareholders if the offer does not close.\n\nWe look forward to moving ahead with our combination with Netflix and delivering the compelling and certain value it will create for shareholders. We urge you to carefully read the 14D-9 filed with the SEC this morning and available on our website, which more fully details the strategic review process and the Board's reasons for its recommendation to you.\n\nThe Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors",

Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription video streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the Warner Bros. library (stocked with fare like Harry Potter and DC Comics).\n\nNetflix, for its part, is advocating for a definition that considers total US TV viewing time. The streamer, which has expressed confidence in its regulatory case, pointed to this in a letter to its employees on Monday.\n\n\"Even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US — still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%),\" Netflix's co-CEOs wrote on Monday, citing Nielsen data. A Netflix spokesperson referred to those remarks when asked for comment.\n\nConvincing antitrust regulators of that could be an uphill battle.\n\n\"Antitrust regulators are likely to define the relevant market narrowly,\" said Anthony Palomba, a business professor at the University of Virginia. \"The FTC and DOJ have consistently treated streaming as a discrete competitive arena, separate from linear television, theatrical distribution, or social video platforms.\"\n\nThe president has said the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem.\"\n\n\"They have a very big market share, and when they have Warner Brothers, you know, that share goes up a lot,\" he said of Netflix.\n\nReuben Miller, the head of antitrust at financial data service Dealreporter, said Netflix's bid would \"be challenged and litigated unless Netflix can convince Trump to come down on their side.\"\n\nHere's how regulators could determine Netflix's competitive market and, by extension, the future of the media business.\n\nA Netflix-Warner Bros. combination would be a colossus. Netflix and HBO Max have accounted for 39% of US paid subscription streaming revenue in 2025, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAny firm with 30% to 40% market share has historically drawn scrutiny from the US government. If regulators see paid streamers as a distinct market, Netflix's Warner Bros. deal could be in trouble.\n\nConsumers may not view social media apps — even when they are watched on a TV screen — as close substitutes for Netflix, Disney+, or Hulu, Palomba said. If so, a Netflix-HBO Max combination could limit choice or lead to price hikes.\n\nThere are few recent parallels to Netflix's Warner Bros. acquisition, Dealreporter's Miller said. One could be Charter Communications, which was allowed to expand its cable operation in 2016, though streamers were in their early days then. Miller said it felt like the government was protecting the nascent streaming industry. However, consumer behavior has changed so dramatically since then that he's unsure if those market definitions would be applicable.\n\n\"The incentive is to start with the assumption that a merger is illegal,\" Miller added. \"They're going to start with as narrow a definition as possible, so they'll probably start with paid streaming. And then the onus is on Netflix to try and get them to expand that market definition.\"\n\nAlthough Netflix is easily the most viewed paid streamer in the US, it's not the top streamer on TV screens.\n\nThat would be free YouTube, whose viewership share has soared relative to Netflix in recent years. At the end of 2022, Netflix and YouTube each commanded 7.5% of viewership on US TVs. But as of October, YouTube had a 12.9% share while Netflix took second place at 8%, according to Nielsen.\n\nAlong with its paid peers, Netflix is also battling free streamers like The Roku Channel and Fox's Tubi that are popular among Gen Z.\n\nWhen adding free streamers into the marketplace, Netflix and HBO Max together accounted for just over a fifth of US streaming minutes in October, MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote on Monday. While 20% share is powerhouse status, it might not be a dealbreaker from an antitrust perspective.\n\nNetflix has argued that it's competing against all of traditional TV, not just streamers.\n\nIts viewership share ranks sixth among TV media distributors, versus its second-place spot in streaming. When measured against cable and broadcast TV, Netflix's 8% share in October was slightly behind the 8.2% share for Paramount, which includes its cable channels and CBS.\n\nAnd since Netflix isn't trying to buy WBD's cable networks like CNN, it could argue that it's only adding a fraction of the media conglomerate's viewership time.\n\nNetflix would undoubtedly love a broad definition of its competitive market that includes TikTok, Instagram, and even video podcasts and video games, which are also spaces where the streamer competes.\n\nSome media insiders see an ultra-broad competitive landscape as a bridge too far.\n\n\"My clients are not pitching shows to YouTube,\" a TV agent said.\n\nCorey Martin of LA-based law firm Granderson Des Rochers said that \"to compare Netflix to YouTube, or even TikTok, is like comparing apples and oranges.\" He said the same applied to video games.\n\nConsumers tend to think of paid streamers like Netflix or Disney+ when they want to watch movies, TV, or sports, Martin said, but \"they don't necessarily think about YouTube or TikTok.\"\n\n\"Directly, it's hard to say that a video game is competing with a movie, or a video game is competing with the TV, even though they do consume our attention,\" said Rahul Telang, a business professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nHowever, some see truth in the idea of an all-consuming battle for attention.\n\nBernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said Netflix may be a leader in long-form video, but others have better sports offerings. Yoon also wrote in a mid-December note that attention has shifted to short-form video on Instagram and TikTok, and even new micro dramas.\n\n\"Critics may claim these are apples and oranges, but we heard the same argument about linear vs. streaming only a decade ago,\" Yoon wrote.",

    "description": "Netflix laid out the rationale for acquiring Warner Bros, saying the deal is: \"pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth.\"",
    "fullText": "Netflix's co-CEOs want to assure staffers that its bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's key assets will be good for the company — and for jobs across Hollywood.\n\nIn a letter sent to staffers on Monday, a copy of which was also filed publicly with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos said a combined Netflix-Warner Bros. is \"pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth.\"\n\n\"We see this as a win for the entertainment industry, not the end of it,\" the Netflix co-CEOs wrote, addressing concerns that the combo of the streaming giant and one of the most iconic studios could bring about \"the end of Hollywood.\"\n\nNetflix this month announced its intention to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for an equity value of $72 billion, which would be the biggest acquisition in the streamer's history.\n\nRival Paramount Skydance responded days later with a hostile bid to acquire all of WBD in a deal valued at around $108 billion.\n\nPeters and Sarandos addressed the hostile bid in the letter, saying it was to be expected but that Netflix has a solid deal in place.\n\n\"It's great for our shareholders, great for consumers, and a strong way to create and protect jobs in the industry,\" they wrote.\n\nThe letter reiterated Netflix's previous arguments for why it's the best bidder for the WBD assets. Its bid faces strong opposition in parts of Hollywood, where many have long harbored suspicions toward Netflix because of its business model that has upended traditional film and TV conventions.\n\nIn particular, Netflix has favored a streaming-first distribution approach and has a practice of putting its movies in theaters for limited runs only. This has created tension with some big-name talent and movie theater owners. Sarandos previously said long, exclusive theatrical windows weren't \"consumer-friendly,\" and that he thinks, over time, theatrical windows will continue to shrink.\n\nIn terms of regulatory approval, both bidders have made the case that they have the clearest path to getting a deal through. Paramount chief David Ellison has said its combo would lead to less market concentration in streaming than Netflix's.\n\nNetflix, for its part, wants regulators to compare its market share to total TV watching time, including free platforms like YouTube. The co-CEOs emphasized this in a letter. They say Netflix plus Warner Bros. would only be 9% of the US market, behind YouTube and Disney. Paramount's argument is that the market should be defined by paid streaming, which is growing and where Netflix stands to expand its dominance.\n\nA wild card is President Donald Trump. David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, are close to Trump, whereas Sarandos has long-standing ties to prominent Democrats. Still, Trump has publicly praised both Netflix and Sarandos. Trump also said that a combo of Netflix and Warner Bros. \"could be a problem\" due to the size, however.\n\nWhen it comes to jobs, Netflix has lobbied Trump that it would be a job saver, not a job killer, since it wouldn't be combining two big studios like Paramount would. Some key numbers to look at are the planned \"synergies,\" which often translate in part to job cuts. Paramount estimated $6 billion, compared to Netflix's $2 billion to $3 billion.\n\nRead the letter from Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos to staffers in full below:\n\nBy: Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos\n\nAs news around our deal with Warner Bros. continued this week, we wanted to keep you as informed as we can. Our position hasn't changed: we strongly believe that Netflix and Warner Bros. joining forces will offer consumers more choice and value, allow the creative community to reach even more audiences with our combined distribution, and fuel our long-term growth. We made this deal because their deep portfolio of iconic franchises, expansive library, and strong studio capabilities will complement—not duplicate—our existing business.\n\nThis is going to be a complex process over the next year or so and there's a lot we won't be able to share, but we did want to give you our thoughts on some of the most pressing questions we've heard since we connected last week.\n\nHow do we feel about Paramount's hostile bid? It was entirely expected. But, we have a solid deal in place. It's great for our shareholders, great for consumers, and a strong way to create and protect jobs in the industry. We're confident we'll get it over the finish line—and we're genuinely excited about what's ahead.\n\nAre we confident regulators will approve? We believe in this deal—in the value it creates— and we're confident we'll get the approvals we need to make it happen. The fundamentals are clear: this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth. Also, if you look at it through the lens of Nielsen data, even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US—still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%). We believe the facts speak for themselves, and we're fully prepared to put ourselves in a strong position for approval.\n\nWill we preserve theatrical releases as part of WBD's distribution model? Yes—we're fully committed to releasing Warner Bros. movies in theaters, just as they do today. Theatrical is an important part of their business and legacy, and we don't want to change what makes Warner Bros. so valuable. If this deal had happened two years ago, hits like Minecraft and Superman would still have premiered on the big screen as they did—and that's how we plan to keep it. We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix. When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\n\nSome feel this is the end of Hollywood. What's our response to that? This is something that we've heard for a long time—including when we started the streaming business. Our stance then and now is the same—we see this as a win for the entertainment industry, not the end of it. This deal is about growth: Warner Bros. brings businesses and capabilities we don't have, so there's no overlap or studio closures. We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.\n\nWhat's next? We've got a small but mighty team of experts working on this so the rest of us can stay focused on the big 2026 ambitions we've established for our business. We've got huge potential still ahead of us—even before we factor in Warner Bros.—so our focus should remain on realizing that potential based on our organic growth. We know that's easier said than done with all the headlines and speculation, but continuing to deliver for our members is the best thing we can focus on.\n\nWhere is the best place to follow along? As a reminder, Take 5 is for employees only. We've launched a public site as our source of truth for external audiences—which will be updated further—and it's a resource you can share with friends and family who might have their own questions. You can also listen to our UBS webcast from earlier this week.",

But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid for WBD, for $30 per share.\n\nIn the letter, Ellison also slammed WBD's advisors for not giving equal weight to Paramount's offer, compared to Netflix's, and described the sales process as being \"opaque.\"\n\n\"To suggest that we are not 'good for the money' (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd,\" he said.\n\nHe said that WBD advisors \"never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers.\"\n\nEllison added that WBD did not grant Paramount a \"single 'real time' negotiating session,\" and had \"sprinted towards a deal with Netflix.\" He said WDB ignored texts from him and his advisors in which they said their $30-per-share offer was not their best and final one.\n\nRepresentatives for WBD did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about Ellison's accusations in the letter.\n\nAfter Paramount launched the hostile bid, Ellison pitched the deal to his own staff in an internal memo on Monday, as seen by Business Insider. He told his staff that the combination of Paramount and WBD would be a \"powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Ellison said at a Tuesday UBS event that he knew why WBD could not accept his latest offer.\n\n\"If they accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty, so I don't think they can just take that,\" Ellison said.\n\nThe bid is partially financed by the wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe media war has not escaped the notice of President Donald Trump, who said he would be involved in the deal. He said on Sunday that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"",

Although internet comedians don't have a say in where the deals land, it hasn't stopped them from weighing in with viral jokes about the dueling companies and their quest to acquire WBD.\n\nSome social media users are poking fun at the back-and-forth with memes about how far each company is willing to go to gain WBD's favor. One post compared the battle for the best offer to a scene from the HBO business drama \"Succession,\" a title Netflix would own if the deal goes through.\n\nA post shared by Karl Smith, CFA (L1 Candidate) (@wallstreetintern)\n\nThe Instagram meme account Litquidity used parody images that appeared to be AI-created of two business leaders speaking at the DealBook Summit to mock how each company is trying to prove its offer is better.\n\nNetflix and Paramount trying to show off why their Warner Bros acquisition offers are better pic.twitter.com/mjpP7sjAnA\n\nSome people seem to be using humor to cope with the idea of more consolidation in Hollywood. They are pushing back on both offers with memes about stopping the looming acquisition completely.\n\nChristopher Nolan, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg on their way to stop Netflix from buying Warner Bros: pic.twitter.com/pnCAU4kclM\n\n\"I'm putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger,\" one X user captioned a compilation video of various actors and famous filmmakers.\n\nI’m putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger: pic.twitter.com/wl26YfGCjg\n\nOthers speculated on what the movie-watching experience could be like under Warner Bros. Discovery's new ownership. One TikTok video showed a man sitting down to watch a movie, only for the intros to include a confusing mix of studios, backers such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and even a DJ, being played before the movie began.\n\nevery company is every company #business#news #netflix\n\nIn the midst of all the jokes, Netflix argues that its offer would be better for consumers and creators, while Ellison says Paramount is more likely to win regulatory approval and offers Hollywood more certainty.\n\nWhat all of this means in the long run is unclear so far. It could lead to job cuts in the entertainment industry as the giants consolidate their power. The trends of streaming services getting pricier and fewer movies hitting theaters could also continue, as companies release less content, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEither way — as with many serious big business deals — consumers and industry insiders are finding ways to laugh through it.",

    "description": "The real story of the fight for Warner Bros. Discovery is viewers shifting from studios to tech platforms, impacting how and what you watch.",
    "fullText": "The Warner Bros. Discovery-Paramount-Netflix drama has Hollywood in a tizzy this week — but it's missing one big thing: What about you?\n\nAmericans are deep in a new era of entertainment and are increasingly likely to get their fix on YouTube and TikTok rather than with WBD's popular franchises like Harry Potter and \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nThe headlines around the deal have focused on whether Netflix or Paramount's David Ellison will win in the boardroom. But the results in your living room will be due to forces that are much bigger than the companies themselves, and have changed the way we watch. Movie theater releases are down, cable TV is dying, streaming prices are likely to rise, and Hollywood's power is waning in the age of tech giants.\n\nThe reason companies like Netflix and Paramount want to buy Warner Bros. is because competition in the entertainment industry is fierce, driven by the decline of cable TV and the rising popularity of small screens and tech companies.\n\n\"If Big Tech never made a move into media, there's a very good chance we wouldn't be seeing this much consolidation as we are now,\" said Brandon Katz, an entertainment analyst at Greenlight Analytics.\n\nNow that Americans spend more time with the big players in entertainment like Google-owned YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon, mergers can help legacy players like Disney, Fox, and Comcast compete. It'll mean lost jobs. The combo that formed WBD led to multiple rounds of layoffs, including about 1,000 roles in mid-2024. Both Paramount and Netflix present themselves as the bigger job savers, but both promise billions in \"synergies\" that will likely result in cuts.\n\n\"The problem is the acquisition and pending consolidation of two media giants, not who the buyer is,\" said The Writers Guild of America, the union representing TV and film writers.\n\nAdditionally, deals offer companies the opportunity to consolidate their brands. WBD has already combined HBO's prestige shows with Discovery's mainstream fare to form HBO Max, and Disney has brought Hulu and ESPN+ into its streaming bundle.\n\nIt all trickles down to what you get to watch, where you watch it, and how much you have to pay. Streaming prices have been increasing while big theatrical movie releases have declined over time, and there's good reason to think those trends will continue, regardless of where Warner Bros. ends up. Industry trends for movie-going are clear, with the number of wide releases and box-office grosses still below their pre-COVID levels.\n\nWhoever ends up with Warner's HBO Max will likely bundle it with their existing streamer and raise the price based on the more expansive offering, Katz said.\n\n\"Within 18 months, all consumers should expect to be paying more for these subscriptions,\" he said.\n\nIt's also widely expected that the combination of two of these companies will lead to less output. That's one of the main objections of Hollywood, whose livelihood depends on stuff getting made.\n\n\"This is one less entity writing checks,\" said Josh Rosenbaum, a producer at Waypoint Entertainment, whose credits have included Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar-winning \"The Favourite.\"\n\nParamount promised that if it wins the WBD battle, it'll release 30 movies a year in theaters, while Netflix says it'll continue to put Warner Bros. movies in theaters while favoring a quick-to-streaming strategy for its own films. The Disney and Fox merger is a cautionary tale; their combined theatrical releases have declined nearly 50% since the merger was announced in 2017.\n\nThe dinosaurs may be fighting a losing battle. People (especially younger generations) are increasingly getting their entertainment from user-generated platforms. A Hub Entertainment Research survey found that people aged 13 to 24 spend an estimated 21% of their screen time watching non-professional videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, compared to just 16% spent on traditional TV shows. In contrast, people aged 35 and up spend 39% of their screen time on TV shows — more than twice as much as they spend on online videos (14%).\n\nThat's put pressure on traditional players. YouTube — not any traditional Hollywood powerhouse — is the No. 1 streaming service on TVs, according to Nielsen. Netflix's engagement per user has stagnated over the past few years, despite the company's increased spending on content, while YouTube has widened its lead on TV screens, according to Bernstein research. Netflix and other leading streamers have taken steps to bring social media-first creators and video podcasters onto their platforms, but show no signs of fundamentally changing their models.\n\n\"The real threat to the media industry in general is the new formats like short form,\" Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said. Paramount is at least talking about a technology-led overhaul of how entertainment is made, which has investors intrigued. But whatever changes it makes are likely to be incremental in the near term, he said.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",

    "description": "The fight between Netflix and Paramount over who will buy Warner Bros. is heating up. Here's what markets are thinking about the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "A bidding war has broken out over one of America's most iconic media companies, and investors in the three firms involved are mixed on the prospect of where it'll all shake out.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery have climbed on the back of a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance to acquire the film and television company, but they're still slightly below the competing bid from Netflix, which was announced as the winner of the sale process last Friday.\n\nParamount on Monday made an all-cash offer worth $30 a share to acquire Warner Bros. and its film studio and streaming services.\n\nIt's unclear which way Warner Bros. will go. The company's board of directors said on Monday that it wasn't changing its recommendation regarding its agreement with Netflix, but would review Paramount's offer over the next two weeks. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nMarkets, though, are flashing some clues about what investors think might happen next. Here's what to watch.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose to $27.70 on Tuesday, just below Netflix's offer of $27.75 a share.\n\nIf the stock were to surpass that level, that could be a sign investors expect Warner Bros. to go with Paramount's offer, or that they expect Netflix to put together a better offer, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I would say that there's a combination of both of those things probably in play right now,\" Hogan said of investors pricing in both scenarios, though he noted that trading activity in Warner Bros. Discovery shares may also be reflecting uncertainty among investors as Paramount revealed its hostile bid on Monday.\n\nThere's also the issue of regulatory approval, which could explain the slight discount in Warner Bros. Discovery stock to Netflix's offer price. Comments from Donald Trump on Monday suggested Netflix's ownership of Warner Bros. could draw scrutiny from the administration.\n\nIn a statement after it unveiled its offer, Paramount said its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery would offer shareholders around $18 billion \n\nNetflix stock is down 7% since last Thursday's close, with shares dropping through Friday's session as investors digested the news that the media giant would acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio business.\n\nInvestors rarely reward the acquirer in a large M&A deal like this, and it appears they're also not thrilled about the prospect of a fierce bidding war.\n\nNetflix stock continued to slide through Monday's session on news of Paramount's competing bid, and dipped again on Tuesday. The streaming platform has agreed to pay Warner Bros. $5.8 billion if its deal doesn't go through.\n\nShares of Paramount Skydance, meanwhile, jumped on Monday on enthusiasm for a potential deal, but the stock slipped 3% on Tuesday.\n\nBettors don't see Paramount's hostile bid going through with ease. While Paramount has edged up slightly over Netflix on some open bets on Polymarket, other wagers have its chances of acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery by mid-2026 at less than 50%.\n\nOn Polymarket, bettors see a 43% chance Paramount will be the winning bid, compared to a 39% chance priced in for Netflix.\n\nOn Kalshi, the odds that Paramount will win are about 50-50.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance and Netflix bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, highlighting streaming, Hollywood jobs, and regulatory approval in their rival pitches.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's latest high-drama battle of the titans: Paramount versus Netflix.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount made a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery after WBD rebuffed its multiple offers and accepted Netflix's offer to buy its studio and streaming business.\n\nThis means Ellison, who is backed by his billionaire father, Larry Ellison of Oracle, is making his case directly to shareholders on why he'd be the best owner for WBD.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"\n\nNetflix didn't respond to the hostile bid but has said that by combining its streaming hits with WBD's classic library and prestige HBO fare, it can supercharge its offering.\n\n\"Together, we can give audiences around the world even more value and choice, and get one step closer to being the most loved and the most valued entertainment company,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in announcing the deal Friday.\n\nHere's how the companies made their cases to various stakeholders, which include investors, employees, Hollywood talent, and regulators.\n\nFinancials: Paramount offered $30 per WBD share for all of WBD, compared to Netflix's offer of $27.75 per WBD share for its streaming and studios business, excluding its TV networks, such as CNN and TNT. While Netflix's offer was a mix of cash and stock, Ellison emphasized that Paramount's offer is all cash, and $17.6 billion more than the Netflix deal, an $82.7 billion offer that includes $72 billion in equity.\n\nApproval: Ellison repeatedly argued that he's more likely to win regulatory approval than Netflix is. He said he anticipated approval coming in as little as 12 months. President Donald Trump said he'll be \"involved\" in evaluating the deal. Larry Ellison is a longtime ally of Trump, and the firm of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is part of the Paramount offer.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Ellison argued that the Paramount deal would be good for jobs and consumers. He said Paramount is committed to growing the film and TV output of both businesses, including a theatrical slate of 30-plus releases a year. It's a pointed contrast with Netflix, whose preference for getting movies onto its streaming service quickly has created friction with the film industry. (Netflix has said it would continue to release Warner Bros. movies in theaters.) Ellison said adding WBD would make Paramount a robust competitor to Netflix, while Netflix buying WBD would extend its dominance in streaming and give it more power to raise prices to consumers.\n\nFinancials: Netflix said the deal would give it a number of financial benefits. While Netflix is the top subscription streaming service, it has a ways to go in creating culture-defining IP. A big part of Netflix's pitch is that it'll be able to build on WBD's famous franchises like DC Comics and Harry Potter, fueling a flywheel that'll expand its business. WBD would have to pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it accepts a different offer, which Netflix said limited its risk. On the other hand, Netflix would have to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee if the deal were blocked by regulators.\n\nApproval: Wall Street analysts have generally characterized Netflix as having a tougher approval path. However, the company has been making the pitch to Trump and his administration. Trump said Sunday that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos visited him last week. Trump said Sarandos was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" However, Trump added that Netflix has \"a very big market share,\" which \"could be a problem.\" Netflix expressed confidence in the approval process, saying it expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, after WBD completes its spinoff of linear channels into a new company, Discovery Global.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Netflix said the deal would provide better choice and value for consumers by bringing together the Warner Bros. film and TV show libraries with its own offerings, and help the WBD's creators reach a bigger audience. Netflix said many of its subscribers don't \n\nWith Hollywood employment stagnating, Netflix also argued that the addition of Warner Bros. would let it expand its production and increase jobs over the long term. It expects to achieve $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings from the deal, primarily coming from eliminating overlapping support staff. Sarandos contrasted this with a Paramount outcome.\n\n\"In the offer Paramount is talking about today, they're talking about $6 billion of synergies,\" he said at a UBS conference on Monday. \"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"",

    "fullText": "David Ellison is officially the CEO of Paramount Skydance. After a successful Paramount merger, next on his wish list is Warner Bros. Discovery — and he's launched a hostile takeover bid in an effort to scoop it out from Netflix's hands.\n\nThe 42-year-old founded Skydance back in 2006 with some help from his father Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder who's worth $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSince then, Skydance has enjoyed considerable success with films including \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\" and \"Baywatch,\" and a total box office haul of more than $8 billion. The merger deal valued Skydance at $4.75 billion.\n\nIts biggest hit has been \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which became the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 after making almost $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\nAfter seeing the original \"Top Gun\" as a child, David Ellison became obsessed with flying. His billionaire father bought him a plane at the age of 13 and they took flying lessons together. By 17, Ellison had begun competing in air shows performing aerial acrobatics.\n\nHe gave up flying competitively after starting a film degree at USC that he later dropped out of, Ellison told Kara Swisher in an episode of The New York Times' \"Sway\" podcast.\n\nBefore becoming an entertainment executive, though, Ellison had a brief foray as an actor.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in a Skydance film called \"Flyboys,\" about American pilots who flew for the French Air Force in World War I.\n\nThe movie cost about $65 million, but flopped after taking just $18 million or so, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSince moving behind the camera, Ellison's company has had a relationship with Paramount that dates back to 2011 when Skydance co-financed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"True Grit\" with the studio.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success, winning 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and taking about $200 million at the box office.\n\nEllison's sister, Megan, is also in the movie game. Her production company Annapurna Pictures was behind releases including \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" \"Her,\" \"American Hustle,\" and \"Phantom Thread,\" all of which received Oscar nominations.\n\nThe $8 billion tie-up of Skydance and Paramount officially closed in August. Ellison named himself chairman and CEO of the newly combined company, Paramount Skydance.\n\nSoon after taking the helm, Ellison led Paramount Skydance through layoffs, which can be common in the wake of a merger. The company laid off 1,000 employees in October and said that more cuts were coming. Six hundred employees took severance packages and quit instead of returning to the office, it said.\n\nEllison has also installed Bari Weiss at the top of CBS News. Weiss left The New York Times Opinion section in 2020 and later built the The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance acquired for about $150 million.\n\nEllison continued his spending run. He brought in Netflix veteran Cindy Holland and shelled out $7.7 billion for UFC rights.\n\n\"Everywhere you look, he's throwing money,\" LightShed Partners media analyst Rich Greenfield told Business Insider. \"That's what Hollywood gets excited about.\"\n\nNow, Ellison has his eye on another acquisition: Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount Skydance had earlier entered a competitive bid against Netflix and Comcast to acquire the company.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery ultimately accepted Netflix's bid to purchase the company's streaming and studio business for $72 billion.\n\nEllison is now fighting to stop that from happening. On December 8, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for WBD, offering to pay shareholders $30 per share for the entire company.\n\nThat morning, Ellison made his case to shareholders and WBD's board on CNBC.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to put billions into Paramount/WBD. Why?",
    "description": "Paramount's Larry and David Ellison are making a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Three of their partners are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.",
    "fullText": "The governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to invest billions of dollars into a would-be mega media conglomerate made up of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhat would they get for their money?\n\nSpoiler: I don't know. And Paramount, the company that wants to use the three oil nations to help finance its bid for WBD, won't say.\n\nBut it sure seems like a question worth asking, as Paramount launches a hostile bid for WBD after losing last week's auction to Netflix.\n\nParamount says the three petrostates will be part of the new bid — as they were in Paramount's previous offers for WBD (something Paramount had at one point denied).\n\nAs of a week ago, those three countries were going to kick in $24 billion — double the $11.8 billion the Ellison family planned to invest in WBD.\n\nNow, Paramount won't say how much the three countries' sovereign wealth funds plan to invest in their newest proposal. It says Larry and David Ellison, who currently own Paramount, along with RedBird Capital, the private equity group, will \"backstop\" the deal — meaning they promise to finance all of it if necessary.\n\nBut Paramount still anticipates those three countries will ultimately invest in a combined Paramount/WBD, along with Jared Kushner — Donald Trump's son-in-law, whose Affinity Partners group invests money on behalf of … Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, among others.\n\nThe difference this time around, Paramount says, is that those countries' sovereign wealth funds won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would operate. They wouldn't get board seats, voting rights, or any other governance over the company. Paramount declined to comment.\n\nThe reason Paramount needs to stress that, apparently, is that Warner Bros. Discovery had previously flagged that as an issue. Now that the oil states won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would be run, Paramount says the deal wouldn't need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a regulatory body that's supposed to sign off on foreign investments in some US companies.\n\nThat's all part of Paramount's pitch it is making to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders: A deal for Paramount to buy WBD will pass regulators much more easily than Netflix buying WBD.\n\nBut who knows how that will actually pan out? Up until last week, the conventional wisdom was that Paramount would be the most likely winner for WBD, in no small part because Larry Ellison was a longtime Donald Trump backer, and his son, David, had been trying to curry favor with Trump as well.\n\nNow it turns out that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was also wooing Trump. He visited Trump at the White House, and Trump seems to have been taken with him: \"He was in the Oval Office last week. I have a lot of respect for him. He is a great person,\" Trump told reporters Sunday night. \"Ted has really done a legendary job.\"\n\nSo in a world where Donald Trump is the most important decision-maker when it comes to what American companies are allowed to do, I don't know if the niceties of CFIUS rules will be the ultimate arbiter. (Here I'll note that last year the US passed a law that required China's ByteDance to divest itself of its ownership in the US. TikTok business or shut down. That hasn't happened, and TikTok is still alive and well in the U.S.)\n\nI also don't know if Trump will particularly care that three Middle Eastern oil states could conceivably own a big chunk of a conglomerate that includes CNN, CBS, HBO, and two movie studios. He has been quite eager to do deals in the Middle East, and last month he rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi crown prince at the White House.\n\nAnd perhaps that eagerness explains why Paramount didn't think it was a big deal to include petrostate investments in the past — and why it still thinks it's OK to have them now.\n\nBut again: If Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi are looking to put anything close to $24 billion into an enormously powerful media conglomerate — one with huge reach in both the US and ambitions for the rest of the world — will they be satisfied with purely financial returns? Or do they expect something else for their money?\n\nI'd love to know. Maybe you would, too.",

    "description": "Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that his winning pitch to Trump for the company to buy Warner Bros. centered on protecting and creating jobs.",
    "fullText": "Before Netflix made its winning bid for Warner Bros., its co-CEO pitched President Donald Trump directly on the merits of the deal.\n\nThe pair found common ground, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said.\n\n\"The president's interests in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said of Trump at the UBS media conference on Monday afternoon.\n\nSarandos said he'd talked to Trump \"many times since the election about the different challenges facing the entertainment industry.\"\n\n\"The president cares deeply about the entertainment industry, and he loves the entertainment industry,\" Sarandos continued.\n\nTrump praised Sarandos on Sunday, calling him a \"great person\" who he said had done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" Still, Trump said Netflix's \"big market share\" in the streaming space \"could be a problem\" as it tries to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.\n\nThe Netflix-Warner Bros. deal reached on Friday is worth $82.7 billion, including $72 billion in equity. WBD's TV networks like CNN or HGTV, aren't in the proposal.\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance responded on Monday with a hostile bid in the form of a $30-per-share, all-cash offer for all of WBD, including the declining TV networks. Netflix's offer is $27.75 per share, comprising mostly cash and some stock. There's debate among analysts about whether Netflix's or Paramount's renewed offer is more attractive, as it depends on the value of WBD's TV networks.\n\nParamount's move \"was entirely expected,\" Sarandos said.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison, who Trump has publicly praised, went on CNBC on Monday morning to tout his company's offer as \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\" Ellison said his company's offer had \"faster regulatory certainty to close\" than Netflix's. Ellison's father, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally and one of the richest people on the planet.\n\nHowever, Netflix also seems to be building rapport with Trump. That could help explain why Netflix's Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters are optimistic about their deal.\n\n\"We are very confident that regulators should, and will, approve it,\" Peters said of the WBD deal.\n\nSarandos pitched the streaming giant's proposed acquisition as a net positive for the labor market, despite the concerns of many in Hollywood. He also said the company is \"deeply committed\" to releasing movies from Warner Bros. in theaters, \"exactly the way they've released those movies today.\"\n\nThat overture could help ease Trump's concerns. Sarandos pitched Netflix as a great job saver.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos warned that Ellison would implement lots of layoffs if his bid won and said the Paramount CEO promised about $6 billion in cost savings from a WBD deal. Those so-called \"synergies,\" in analyst jargon, translate to a smaller workforce, Sarandos said.\n\n\"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,\" Sarandos said. \"We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"\n\nNetflix has promised investors $2 billion to $3 billion in its own cost savings from its Warner Bros. deal, however.",

    "description": "In seeking to buy Warner Brothers for $108 billion, Paramount is making one of the top ten largest hostile takeover bids in history.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance's bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery is a big deal — literally.\n\nThe all-cash offer of $30 per share works out to a valuation of more than $108 billion, or an equity valuation of $78.7 billion, for WBD's entire operation, putting it in the upper echelons of hostile takeover attempts in recent decades.\n\nIn fairness, the $82.7 billion deal, or $72 billion equity valuation, from streaming giant Netflix is also pretty massive. That was the one WBD's board had agreed on, and it excluded certain pieces of the business.\n\n\"We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.\" Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement.\n\nTo get a sense of the biggest hostile takeover deals of the past 30 years, Business Insider asked financial analytics provider Dealogic to pull the numbers.\n\nHere are the equity valuations of the 14 largest hostile takeover announcements since 1995, and where the Paramount deal for WBD would fit in.\n\nComcast launched an unsolicited bid for AT&T Broadband, which was then the largest cable operator in the US. After a few rounds of negotiations and pressure from shareholders, AT&T accepted the offer. The deal gave rise to Comcast's national expansion.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Tesla made an unsolicited offer to buy Twitter after building a large stake. Twitter initially resisted, but eventually accepted the deal. Musk, however, tried to back out of the deal and was met with litigation, before eventually closing the takeover he started. Musk had since then changed the platform's algorithm, its name, and content moderation rules.\n\nIn what was at the time Europe's largest hostile takeover, RBS and Bank of Scotland fought in a bidding war for NatWest, which ended with RBS's victory through a hostile offer. The deal helped RBS become a global banking giant, but at the cost of taking on excessive debt. RBS collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nRoche, which already owned a majority stake in Genentech, launched a hostile bid for full ownership. The biotech company initially resisted the attempt due to undervaluation. After raising the offer, Roche succeeded.\n\nBAT made an unsolicited offer to buy the remainder of Reynolds, after already owning a large stake in it. Reynolds negotiated a higher price but ultimately accepted the takeover. The deal created the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company at the time.\n\nBelgium's InBev made a hostile offer for Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of beer brand Budweiser. AB's management and founding family initially resisted being taken over by a foreign company, but shareholders pressured them to accept after InBev raised its bid.\n\nBayer made an unsolicited offer to Monsanto, and the chemical company held out for a higher price before accepting the deal. Unfortunately for Bayer, the German biotech company also inherited lawsuits against Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.\n\nTotalFina launched a hostile bid for Elf in a dramatic French corporate battle. After nearly a year of fighting and regulatory scrutiny, the companies merged and became one of the world's biggest oil companies. The combined entity was eventually renamed as TotalEnergies.\n\nJapanese company Takeda made a series of unsolicited bids for UK-based Shire. Shire repeatedly rejected the deal until Takeda substantially increased the offer. This is one of the largest acquisitions ever made by a Japanese company, and it gave Takeda a large rare disease drug portfolio.\n\nSanofi's unsolicited takeover was met with strong resistance from Aventis, so much so that the company sought to be acquired by a different pharmaceutical giant, Novartis. Sanofi sweetened the offer, and Aventis eventually accepted it.\n\nParamount launched its hostile takeover bid after WBD's board bypassed its offers in favor of a deal with Netflix.\n\nPfizer launched a hostile bid to break apart Warner-Lambert's agreed merger with American Home Products. Warner-Lambert fought back but ultimately conceded. This gave Pfizer full ownership of Lipitor, which holds the record for the highest lifetime sales for a single drug.\n\nImmediately before the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays tried to acquire ABN AMRO amicably, but RBS, alongside Fortis and Banco Santander, countered with a hostile, higher bid and won. The acquisition sped up RBS's collapse soon after.\n\nIn a move that consolidated much of the world's beer industry under one entity, AB InBev launched a hostile offer for SABMiller, eventually raising the bid to satisfy resistant shareholders.\n\nUK company Vodafone AirTouch launched a hostile bid for German company Mannesmann, which had rapidly become one of Europe's most valuable telecom companies. Mannesmann fiercely resisted, framing the bid as an attack on German industrial values and national pride. The record-setting battle lasted three months, ending with Vodafone winning by raising the bid.",

But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well.

    "title": "What the Netflix/Warner Bros. Merger Could Mean for Streaming",
    "description": "Is HBO Max dead, and will you be able to watch 'Game of Thrones' on Netflix?",
    "fullText": "After initial reporting from The Wrap revealed that Netflix had won the bidding war for Warner Bros., the streamer stepped in on Friday to confirm that it has a deal with the Warner Bros. board to acquire the home of HBO and HBO Max, DC Comics, and Bugs Bunny for $82.7 billion. The acquisition would put an end to merger attempts from the likes of Paramount and Comcast, but it's also far from a done deal.\n\nAccording to Netflix, its acquisition of Warner Bros. will need to wait until at least Q3 2026, to allow room for the previously announced Warner Bros. and Discovery split to go through, as Netflix does not plan to buy the Discovery part of the business (including its cable channels). Additionally, the deal will need to go through regulatory approval. Given these roadblocks, the companies expect \"to close in 12–18 months.\"\n\nThe news of the acquisition follows Warner Bros.' announcement in October that it was open to a sale, at least partially motivated by its split with Discovery.\n\nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. The Wrap reported that Netflix's deal with Warner Bros. includes a $5 billion breakup fee in case regulators block the deal, pointing to some anxiety from both companies. To that end, CNBC reported that \"a senior [Trump] administration official\" has said that the government is looking at the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" and The New York Post and the Wall Street Journal both reported that Paramount (which recently completed its own merger with Skydance Entertainment, led by Trump ally David Ellison) is currently warning the administration away from allowing the deal. To that end, the BBC reported over the weekend that Trump said the merger \"could be a problem.\"\n\nParamount is also not done bidding, it seems. The company announced a $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid this morning, bypassing the board and offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery shares from shareholders at a premium. Notably, if accepted, the deal would include the whole of Warner Bros. Discovery, despite the upcoming split, which would also give Paramount access to cable networks like CNN and TBS. In its announcement, Paramount called out the Netflix deal as facing a \"challenging regulatory approval process,\" implying that it would better be able to negotiate with the administration.\n\nHow regulators will respond to the purchase remains to be seen, but if the deal does go through, it will mark a major shift for both Hollywood and consumers. Netflix hasn't laid out complete plans for how the merger would affects its customers, but in its press release, it has offered a few hints. Should a combined Netflix and Warner Bros. come to pass, here's how you can expect it to affect you.\n\nSince Netflix's primary business is as a streaming app, the most obvious result of a Warner Bros. acquisition would probably be the shuttering of HBO Max, and the inclusion of its content into Netflix proper. However, it seems like we're more likely to get a Disney+/Hulu situation, with the company running both services simultaneously.\n\nIn its post announcing the merger, Netflix said it will \"maintain Warner Bros.' current operations,\" and that HBO and HBO Max would be viewed as a \"compelling, complementary offering\" for its customers.\n\nWhether that means Netflix subscribers will get complementary HBO subscriptions, or if they will simply be able to add HBO onto their plans as complemental \"content,\" is unclear, although I would expect the latter interpretation to be the correct one. After all, Disney charges an additional fee for users who also want to There would be little reason for Netflix to not follow suit.\n\nThis is backed up by another line further into the press release which states that, \"[b]y adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.\" That implies HBO is something you'll add to an existing subscription, rather than content that will just become part of a base Netflix subscription, with the company saying the acquisition \"also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers.\"\n\nNetflix already offers a small smattering of shows originally developed for either HBO or HBO Max, such as Sex and the City and Scavenger's Reign. This is due to pre-existing content sharing agreements, but it's possible Netflix may continue to offer some HBO content to its existing subscribers for free, even if it continues to operate HBO as a separate entity.\n\nFor instance, Netflix says in the merger announcement that \"shows and movies such as The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz and the DC Universe will join Netflix's extensive portfolio.\" While this is likely simply acknowledging acquired IP, I wouldn't be surprised to see some select shows hit Netflix from time to time, either to prop up sparse release schedules or to promote HBO subscriptions/add-ons.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Greg Peters also says in the release that, \"[w]ith our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they [Warner Bros.] create.\" He adds this would be an opportunity to attract, \"more fans to our best-in-class streaming service.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is most known to consumers as an app, its large selection of original content also means that it operates as a production studio. Netflix says that it will use the acquisition of Warner Bros. production side to \"enhance Netflix's studio capabilities, allowing the Company to significantly expand U.S. production.\"\n\nThis means that viewers might expect to see more original Netflix content in the future, specifically more American-made shows in the vein of Stranger Things, alongside localized foreign programming like Squid Game.\n\nAlongside its movie and TV businesses, Netflix will also be acquiring Warner Bros. Games, a spokesperson confirmed to Game Developer. That means the company will now be responsible for publishing both licensed works, such as the Batman Arkham series, as well as gaming originals, like the Mortal Kombat series. Little is known about how Netflix will handle suddenly being in charge of these longstanding AAA series, but given the company's recent gaming ambitions and its promise to continue Warner Bros. operations as usual, it's likely these titles will continue in some capacity.\n\nIn addition to suddenly stepping into big-budget, AAA gaming, Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. also means it's getting control of DC Comics' print business alongside its film and TV businesses, as the publisher is wholly owned by Warner Bros. That's another big step for the company, although given that DC's print business serves largely as the foundation of lucrative IP such as Superman and Batman, it's likely Netflix will do its best to keep operations there as smooth as possible. However, readers might expect some Netflix and DC synergy, similar to when Marvel started publishing new Star Wars comics shortly after Disney acquired Lucasfilm. Batman visiting the Upside-Down from Stranger Things might be more likely than you'd think.\n\nFinally, while Netflix's past movie releases have often relied on direct-to-streaming drops complemented by just enough of a theatrical presence to qualify for awards, Netflix said in its release that it plans to continue distributing Warner Bros. produced movies as usual, \"including theatrical releases for films,\" but that the exclusive theatrical window may shrink. In other words, The Batman 2 probably isn't going to get the Knives Out or KPop Demon Hunters treatment, but theater exclusivity for Warner Bros. movies might not be as long going forward.",
