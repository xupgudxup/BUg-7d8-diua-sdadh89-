    "description": "Paramount Skydance and Netflix bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, highlighting streaming, Hollywood jobs, and regulatory approval in their rival pitches.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's latest high-drama battle of the titans: Paramount versus Netflix.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount made a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery after WBD rebuffed its multiple offers and accepted Netflix's offer to buy its studio and streaming business.\n\nThis means Ellison, who is backed by his billionaire father, Larry Ellison of Oracle, is making his case directly to shareholders on why he'd be the best owner for WBD.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"\n\nNetflix didn't respond to the hostile bid but has said that by combining its streaming hits with WBD's classic library and prestige HBO fare, it can supercharge its offering.\n\n\"Together, we can give audiences around the world even more value and choice, and get one step closer to being the most loved and the most valued entertainment company,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in announcing the deal Friday.\n\nHere's how the companies made their cases to various stakeholders, which include investors, employees, Hollywood talent, and regulators.\n\nFinancials: Paramount offered $30 per WBD share for all of WBD, compared to Netflix's offer of $27.75 per WBD share for its streaming and studios business, excluding its TV networks, such as CNN and TNT. While Netflix's offer was a mix of cash and stock, Ellison emphasized that Paramount's offer is all cash, and $17.6 billion more than the Netflix deal, an $82.7 billion offer that includes $72 billion in equity.\n\nApproval: Ellison repeatedly argued that he's more likely to win regulatory approval than Netflix is. He said he anticipated approval coming in as little as 12 months. President Donald Trump said he'll be \"involved\" in evaluating the deal. Larry Ellison is a longtime ally of Trump, and the firm of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is part of the Paramount offer.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Ellison argued that the Paramount deal would be good for jobs and consumers. He said Paramount is committed to growing the film and TV output of both businesses, including a theatrical slate of 30-plus releases a year. It's a pointed contrast with Netflix, whose preference for getting movies onto its streaming service quickly has created friction with the film industry. (Netflix has said it would continue to release Warner Bros. movies in theaters.) Ellison said adding WBD would make Paramount a robust competitor to Netflix, while Netflix buying WBD would extend its dominance in streaming and give it more power to raise prices to consumers.\n\nFinancials: Netflix said the deal would give it a number of financial benefits. While Netflix is the top subscription streaming service, it has a ways to go in creating culture-defining IP. A big part of Netflix's pitch is that it'll be able to build on WBD's famous franchises like DC Comics and Harry Potter, fueling a flywheel that'll expand its business. WBD would have to pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it accepts a different offer, which Netflix said limited its risk. On the other hand, Netflix would have to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee if the deal were blocked by regulators.\n\nApproval: Wall Street analysts have generally characterized Netflix as having a tougher approval path. However, the company has been making the pitch to Trump and his administration. Trump said Sunday that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos visited him last week. Trump said Sarandos was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" However, Trump added that Netflix has \"a very big market share,\" which \"could be a problem.\" Netflix expressed confidence in the approval process, saying it expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, after WBD completes its spinoff of linear channels into a new company, Discovery Global.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Netflix said the deal would provide better choice and value for consumers by bringing together the Warner Bros. film and TV show libraries with its own offerings, and help the WBD's creators reach a bigger audience. Netflix said many of its subscribers don't \n\nWith Hollywood employment stagnating, Netflix also argued that the addition of Warner Bros. would let it expand its production and increase jobs over the long term. It expects to achieve $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings from the deal, primarily coming from eliminating overlapping support staff. Sarandos contrasted this with a Paramount outcome.\n\n\"In the offer Paramount is talking about today, they're talking about $6 billion of synergies,\" he said at a UBS conference on Monday. \"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"",

    "description": "David Ellison is officially chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance after an $8 billion tie-up. Next on his wish list: Warner Bros Discovery.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is officially the CEO of Paramount Skydance. After a successful Paramount merger, next on his wish list is Warner Bros. Discovery — and he's launched a hostile takeover bid in an effort to scoop it out from Netflix's hands.\n\nThe 42-year-old founded Skydance back in 2006 with some help from his father Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder who's worth $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSince then, Skydance has enjoyed considerable success with films including \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\" and \"Baywatch,\" and a total box office haul of more than $8 billion. The merger deal valued Skydance at $4.75 billion.\n\nIts biggest hit has been \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which became the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 after making almost $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\nAfter seeing the original \"Top Gun\" as a child, David Ellison became obsessed with flying. His billionaire father bought him a plane at the age of 13 and they took flying lessons together. By 17, Ellison had begun competing in air shows performing aerial acrobatics.\n\nHe gave up flying competitively after starting a film degree at USC that he later dropped out of, Ellison told Kara Swisher in an episode of The New York Times' \"Sway\" podcast.\n\nBefore becoming an entertainment executive, though, Ellison had a brief foray as an actor.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in a Skydance film called \"Flyboys,\" about American pilots who flew for the French Air Force in World War I.\n\nThe movie cost about $65 million, but flopped after taking just $18 million or so, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSince moving behind the camera, Ellison's company has had a relationship with Paramount that dates back to 2011 when Skydance co-financed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"True Grit\" with the studio.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success, winning 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and taking about $200 million at the box office.\n\nEllison's sister, Megan, is also in the movie game. Her production company Annapurna Pictures was behind releases including \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" \"Her,\" \"American Hustle,\" and \"Phantom Thread,\" all of which received Oscar nominations.\n\nThe $8 billion tie-up of Skydance and Paramount officially closed in August. Ellison named himself chairman and CEO of the newly combined company, Paramount Skydance.\n\nSoon after taking the helm, Ellison led Paramount Skydance through layoffs, which can be common in the wake of a merger. The company laid off 1,000 employees in October and said that more cuts were coming. Six hundred employees took severance packages and quit instead of returning to the office, it said.\n\nEllison has also installed Bari Weiss at the top of CBS News. Weiss left The New York Times Opinion section in 2020 and later built the The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance acquired for about $150 million.\n\nEllison continued his spending run. He brought in Netflix veteran Cindy Holland and shelled out $7.7 billion for UFC rights.\n\n\"Everywhere you look, he's throwing money,\" LightShed Partners media analyst Rich Greenfield told Business Insider. \"That's what Hollywood gets excited about.\"\n\nNow, Ellison has his eye on another acquisition: Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount Skydance had earlier entered a competitive bid against Netflix and Comcast to acquire the company.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery ultimately accepted Netflix's bid to purchase the company's streaming and studio business for $72 billion.\n\nEllison is now fighting to stop that from happening. On December 8, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for WBD, offering to pay shareholders $30 per share for the entire company.\n\nThat morning, Ellison made his case to shareholders and WBD's board on CNBC.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to put billions into Paramount/WBD. Why?",
    "description": "Paramount's Larry and David Ellison are making a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Three of their partners are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.",
    "fullText": "The governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to invest billions of dollars into a would-be mega media conglomerate made up of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhat would they get for their money?\n\nSpoiler: I don't know. And Paramount, the company that wants to use the three oil nations to help finance its bid for WBD, won't say.\n\nBut it sure seems like a question worth asking, as Paramount launches a hostile bid for WBD after losing last week's auction to Netflix.\n\nParamount says the three petrostates will be part of the new bid — as they were in Paramount's previous offers for WBD (something Paramount had at one point denied).\n\nAs of a week ago, those three countries were going to kick in $24 billion — double the $11.8 billion the Ellison family planned to invest in WBD.\n\nNow, Paramount won't say how much the three countries' sovereign wealth funds plan to invest in their newest proposal. It says Larry and David Ellison, who currently own Paramount, along with RedBird Capital, the private equity group, will \"backstop\" the deal — meaning they promise to finance all of it if necessary.\n\nBut Paramount still anticipates those three countries will ultimately invest in a combined Paramount/WBD, along with Jared Kushner — Donald Trump's son-in-law, whose Affinity Partners group invests money on behalf of … Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, among others.\n\nThe difference this time around, Paramount says, is that those countries' sovereign wealth funds won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would operate. They wouldn't get board seats, voting rights, or any other governance over the company. Paramount declined to comment.\n\nThe reason Paramount needs to stress that, apparently, is that Warner Bros. Discovery had previously flagged that as an issue. Now that the oil states won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would be run, Paramount says the deal wouldn't need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a regulatory body that's supposed to sign off on foreign investments in some US companies.\n\nThat's all part of Paramount's pitch it is making to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders: A deal for Paramount to buy WBD will pass regulators much more easily than Netflix buying WBD.\n\nBut who knows how that will actually pan out? Up until last week, the conventional wisdom was that Paramount would be the most likely winner for WBD, in no small part because Larry Ellison was a longtime Donald Trump backer, and his son, David, had been trying to curry favor with Trump as well.\n\nNow it turns out that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was also wooing Trump. He visited Trump at the White House, and Trump seems to have been taken with him: \"He was in the Oval Office last week. I have a lot of respect for him. He is a great person,\" Trump told reporters Sunday night. \"Ted has really done a legendary job.\"\n\nSo in a world where Donald Trump is the most important decision-maker when it comes to what American companies are allowed to do, I don't know if the niceties of CFIUS rules will be the ultimate arbiter. (Here I'll note that last year the US passed a law that required China's ByteDance to divest itself of its ownership in the US. TikTok business or shut down. That hasn't happened, and TikTok is still alive and well in the U.S.)\n\nI also don't know if Trump will particularly care that three Middle Eastern oil states could conceivably own a big chunk of a conglomerate that includes CNN, CBS, HBO, and two movie studios. He has been quite eager to do deals in the Middle East, and last month he rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi crown prince at the White House.\n\nAnd perhaps that eagerness explains why Paramount didn't think it was a big deal to include petrostate investments in the past — and why it still thinks it's OK to have them now.\n\nBut again: If Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi are looking to put anything close to $24 billion into an enormously powerful media conglomerate — one with huge reach in both the US and ambitions for the rest of the world — will they be satisfied with purely financial returns? Or do they expect something else for their money?\n\nI'd love to know. Maybe you would, too.",

    "fullText": "Before Netflix made its winning bid for Warner Bros., its co-CEO pitched President Donald Trump directly on the merits of the deal.\n\nThe pair found common ground, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said.\n\n\"The president's interests in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said of Trump at the UBS media conference on Monday afternoon.\n\nSarandos said he'd talked to Trump \"many times since the election about the different challenges facing the entertainment industry.\"\n\n\"The president cares deeply about the entertainment industry, and he loves the entertainment industry,\" Sarandos continued.\n\nTrump praised Sarandos on Sunday, calling him a \"great person\" who he said had done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" Still, Trump said Netflix's \"big market share\" in the streaming space \"could be a problem\" as it tries to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.\n\nThe Netflix-Warner Bros. deal reached on Friday is worth $82.7 billion, including $72 billion in equity. WBD's TV networks like CNN or HGTV, aren't in the proposal.\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance responded on Monday with a hostile bid in the form of a $30-per-share, all-cash offer for all of WBD, including the declining TV networks. Netflix's offer is $27.75 per share, comprising mostly cash and some stock. There's debate among analysts about whether Netflix's or Paramount's renewed offer is more attractive, as it depends on the value of WBD's TV networks.\n\nParamount's move \"was entirely expected,\" Sarandos said.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison, who Trump has publicly praised, went on CNBC on Monday morning to tout his company's offer as \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\" Ellison said his company's offer had \"faster regulatory certainty to close\" than Netflix's. Ellison's father, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally and one of the richest people on the planet.\n\nHowever, Netflix also seems to be building rapport with Trump. That could help explain why Netflix's Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters are optimistic about their deal.\n\n\"We are very confident that regulators should, and will, approve it,\" Peters said of the WBD deal.\n\nSarandos pitched the streaming giant's proposed acquisition as a net positive for the labor market, despite the concerns of many in Hollywood. He also said the company is \"deeply committed\" to releasing movies from Warner Bros. in theaters, \"exactly the way they've released those movies today.\"\n\nThat overture could help ease Trump's concerns. Sarandos pitched Netflix as a great job saver.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos warned that Ellison would implement lots of layoffs if his bid won and said the Paramount CEO promised about $6 billion in cost savings from a WBD deal. Those so-called \"synergies,\" in analyst jargon, translate to a smaller workforce, Sarandos said.\n\n\"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,\" Sarandos said. \"We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"\n\nNetflix has promised investors $2 billion to $3 billion in its own cost savings from its Warner Bros. deal, however.",

    "description": "In seeking to buy Warner Brothers for $108 billion, Paramount is making one of the top ten largest hostile takeover bids in history.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance's bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery is a big deal — literally.\n\nThe all-cash offer of $30 per share works out to a valuation of more than $108 billion, or an equity valuation of $78.7 billion, for WBD's entire operation, putting it in the upper echelons of hostile takeover attempts in recent decades.\n\nIn fairness, the $82.7 billion deal, or $72 billion equity valuation, from streaming giant Netflix is also pretty massive. That was the one WBD's board had agreed on, and it excluded certain pieces of the business.\n\n\"We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.\" Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement.\n\nTo get a sense of the biggest hostile takeover deals of the past 30 years, Business Insider asked financial analytics provider Dealogic to pull the numbers.\n\nHere are the equity valuations of the 14 largest hostile takeover announcements since 1995, and where the Paramount deal for WBD would fit in.\n\nComcast launched an unsolicited bid for AT&T Broadband, which was then the largest cable operator in the US. After a few rounds of negotiations and pressure from shareholders, AT&T accepted the offer. The deal gave rise to Comcast's national expansion.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Tesla made an unsolicited offer to buy Twitter after building a large stake. Twitter initially resisted, but eventually accepted the deal. Musk, however, tried to back out of the deal and was met with litigation, before eventually closing the takeover he started. Musk had since then changed the platform's algorithm, its name, and content moderation rules.\n\nIn what was at the time Europe's largest hostile takeover, RBS and Bank of Scotland fought in a bidding war for NatWest, which ended with RBS's victory through a hostile offer. The deal helped RBS become a global banking giant, but at the cost of taking on excessive debt. RBS collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nRoche, which already owned a majority stake in Genentech, launched a hostile bid for full ownership. The biotech company initially resisted the attempt due to undervaluation. After raising the offer, Roche succeeded.\n\nBAT made an unsolicited offer to buy the remainder of Reynolds, after already owning a large stake in it. Reynolds negotiated a higher price but ultimately accepted the takeover. The deal created the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company at the time.\n\nBelgium's InBev made a hostile offer for Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of beer brand Budweiser. AB's management and founding family initially resisted being taken over by a foreign company, but shareholders pressured them to accept after InBev raised its bid.\n\nBayer made an unsolicited offer to Monsanto, and the chemical company held out for a higher price before accepting the deal. Unfortunately for Bayer, the German biotech company also inherited lawsuits against Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.\n\nTotalFina launched a hostile bid for Elf in a dramatic French corporate battle. After nearly a year of fighting and regulatory scrutiny, the companies merged and became one of the world's biggest oil companies. The combined entity was eventually renamed as TotalEnergies.\n\nJapanese company Takeda made a series of unsolicited bids for UK-based Shire. Shire repeatedly rejected the deal until Takeda substantially increased the offer. This is one of the largest acquisitions ever made by a Japanese company, and it gave Takeda a large rare disease drug portfolio.\n\nSanofi's unsolicited takeover was met with strong resistance from Aventis, so much so that the company sought to be acquired by a different pharmaceutical giant, Novartis. Sanofi sweetened the offer, and Aventis eventually accepted it.\n\nParamount launched its hostile takeover bid after WBD's board bypassed its offers in favor of a deal with Netflix.\n\nPfizer launched a hostile bid to break apart Warner-Lambert's agreed merger with American Home Products. Warner-Lambert fought back but ultimately conceded. This gave Pfizer full ownership of Lipitor, which holds the record for the highest lifetime sales for a single drug.\n\nImmediately before the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays tried to acquire ABN AMRO amicably, but RBS, alongside Fortis and Banco Santander, countered with a hostile, higher bid and won. The acquisition sped up RBS's collapse soon after.\n\nIn a move that consolidated much of the world's beer industry under one entity, AB InBev launched a hostile offer for SABMiller, eventually raising the bid to satisfy resistant shareholders.\n\nUK company Vodafone AirTouch launched a hostile bid for German company Mannesmann, which had rapidly become one of Europe's most valuable telecom companies. Mannesmann fiercely resisted, framing the bid as an attack on German industrial values and national pride. The record-setting battle lasted three months, ending with Vodafone winning by raising the bid.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",

    "description": "Is HBO Max dead, and will you be able to watch 'Game of Thrones' on Netflix?",
    "fullText": "After initial reporting from The Wrap revealed that Netflix had won the bidding war for Warner Bros., the streamer stepped in on Friday to confirm that it has a deal with the Warner Bros. board to acquire the home of HBO and HBO Max, DC Comics, and Bugs Bunny for $82.7 billion. The acquisition would put an end to merger attempts from the likes of Paramount and Comcast, but it's also far from a done deal.\n\nAccording to Netflix, its acquisition of Warner Bros. will need to wait until at least Q3 2026, to allow room for the previously announced Warner Bros. and Discovery split to go through, as Netflix does not plan to buy the Discovery part of the business (including its cable channels). Additionally, the deal will need to go through regulatory approval. Given these roadblocks, the companies expect \"to close in 12–18 months.\"\n\nThe news of the acquisition follows Warner Bros.' announcement in October that it was open to a sale, at least partially motivated by its split with Discovery.\n\nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. The Wrap reported that Netflix's deal with Warner Bros. includes a $5 billion breakup fee in case regulators block the deal, pointing to some anxiety from both companies. To that end, CNBC reported that \"a senior [Trump] administration official\" has said that the government is looking at the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" and The New York Post and the Wall Street Journal both reported that Paramount (which recently completed its own merger with Skydance Entertainment, led by Trump ally David Ellison) is currently warning the administration away from allowing the deal. To that end, the BBC reported over the weekend that Trump said the merger \"could be a problem.\"\n\nParamount is also not done bidding, it seems. The company announced a $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid this morning, bypassing the board and offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery shares from shareholders at a premium. Notably, if accepted, the deal would include the whole of Warner Bros. Discovery, despite the upcoming split, which would also give Paramount access to cable networks like CNN and TBS. In its announcement, Paramount called out the Netflix deal as facing a \"challenging regulatory approval process,\" implying that it would better be able to negotiate with the administration.\n\nHow regulators will respond to the purchase remains to be seen, but if the deal does go through, it will mark a major shift for both Hollywood and consumers. Netflix hasn't laid out complete plans for how the merger would affects its customers, but in its press release, it has offered a few hints. Should a combined Netflix and Warner Bros. come to pass, here's how you can expect it to affect you.\n\nSince Netflix's primary business is as a streaming app, the most obvious result of a Warner Bros. acquisition would probably be the shuttering of HBO Max, and the inclusion of its content into Netflix proper. However, it seems like we're more likely to get a Disney+/Hulu situation, with the company running both services simultaneously.\n\nIn its post announcing the merger, Netflix said it will \"maintain Warner Bros.' current operations,\" and that HBO and HBO Max would be viewed as a \"compelling, complementary offering\" for its customers.\n\nWhether that means Netflix subscribers will get complementary HBO subscriptions, or if they will simply be able to add HBO onto their plans as complemental \"content,\" is unclear, although I would expect the latter interpretation to be the correct one. After all, Disney charges an additional fee for users who also want to There would be little reason for Netflix to not follow suit.\n\nThis is backed up by another line further into the press release which states that, \"[b]y adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.\" That implies HBO is something you'll add to an existing subscription, rather than content that will just become part of a base Netflix subscription, with the company saying the acquisition \"also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers.\"\n\nNetflix already offers a small smattering of shows originally developed for either HBO or HBO Max, such as Sex and the City and Scavenger's Reign. This is due to pre-existing content sharing agreements, but it's possible Netflix may continue to offer some HBO content to its existing subscribers for free, even if it continues to operate HBO as a separate entity.\n\nFor instance, Netflix says in the merger announcement that \"shows and movies such as The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz and the DC Universe will join Netflix's extensive portfolio.\" While this is likely simply acknowledging acquired IP, I wouldn't be surprised to see some select shows hit Netflix from time to time, either to prop up sparse release schedules or to promote HBO subscriptions/add-ons.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Greg Peters also says in the release that, \"[w]ith our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they [Warner Bros.] create.\" He adds this would be an opportunity to attract, \"more fans to our best-in-class streaming service.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is most known to consumers as an app, its large selection of original content also means that it operates as a production studio. Netflix says that it will use the acquisition of Warner Bros. production side to \"enhance Netflix's studio capabilities, allowing the Company to significantly expand U.S. production.\"\n\nThis means that viewers might expect to see more original Netflix content in the future, specifically more American-made shows in the vein of Stranger Things, alongside localized foreign programming like Squid Game.\n\nAlongside its movie and TV businesses, Netflix will also be acquiring Warner Bros. Games, a spokesperson confirmed to Game Developer. That means the company will now be responsible for publishing both licensed works, such as the Batman Arkham series, as well as gaming originals, like the Mortal Kombat series. Little is known about how Netflix will handle suddenly being in charge of these longstanding AAA series, but given the company's recent gaming ambitions and its promise to continue Warner Bros. operations as usual, it's likely these titles will continue in some capacity.\n\nIn addition to suddenly stepping into big-budget, AAA gaming, Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. also means it's getting control of DC Comics' print business alongside its film and TV businesses, as the publisher is wholly owned by Warner Bros. That's another big step for the company, although given that DC's print business serves largely as the foundation of lucrative IP such as Superman and Batman, it's likely Netflix will do its best to keep operations there as smooth as possible. However, readers might expect some Netflix and DC synergy, similar to when Marvel started publishing new Star Wars comics shortly after Disney acquired Lucasfilm. Batman visiting the Upside-Down from Stranger Things might be more likely than you'd think.\n\nFinally, while Netflix's past movie releases have often relied on direct-to-streaming drops complemented by just enough of a theatrical presence to qualify for awards, Netflix said in its release that it plans to continue distributing Warner Bros. produced movies as usual, \"including theatrical releases for films,\" but that the exclusive theatrical window may shrink. In other words, The Batman 2 probably isn't going to get the Knives Out or KPop Demon Hunters treatment, but theater exclusivity for Warner Bros. movies might not be as long going forward.",
