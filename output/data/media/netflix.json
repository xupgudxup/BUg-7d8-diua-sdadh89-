    "description": "David Ellison is officially chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance after an $8 billion tie-up. Next on his wish list: Warner Bros Discovery.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is officially the CEO of Paramount Skydance. After a successful Paramount merger, next on his wish list is Warner Bros. Discovery — and he's launched a hostile takeover bid in an effort to scoop it out from Netflix's hands.\n\nThe 42-year-old founded Skydance back in 2006 with some help from his father Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder who's worth $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSince then, Skydance has enjoyed considerable success with films including \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\" and \"Baywatch,\" and a total box office haul of more than $8 billion. The merger deal valued Skydance at $4.75 billion.\n\nIts biggest hit has been \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which became the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 after making almost $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\nAfter seeing the original \"Top Gun\" as a child, David Ellison became obsessed with flying. His billionaire father bought him a plane at the age of 13 and they took flying lessons together. By 17, Ellison had begun competing in air shows performing aerial acrobatics.\n\nHe gave up flying competitively after starting a film degree at USC that he later dropped out of, Ellison told Kara Swisher in an episode of The New York Times' \"Sway\" podcast.\n\nBefore becoming an entertainment executive, though, Ellison had a brief foray as an actor.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in a Skydance film called \"Flyboys,\" about American pilots who flew for the French Air Force in World War I.\n\nThe movie cost about $65 million, but flopped after taking just $18 million or so, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSince moving behind the camera, Ellison's company has had a relationship with Paramount that dates back to 2011 when Skydance co-financed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"True Grit\" with the studio.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success, winning 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and taking about $200 million at the box office.\n\nEllison's sister, Megan, is also in the movie game. Her production company Annapurna Pictures was behind releases including \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" \"Her,\" \"American Hustle,\" and \"Phantom Thread,\" all of which received Oscar nominations.\n\nThe $8 billion tie-up of Skydance and Paramount officially closed in August. Ellison named himself chairman and CEO of the newly combined company, Paramount Skydance.\n\nSoon after taking the helm, Ellison led Paramount Skydance through layoffs, which can be common in the wake of a merger. The company laid off 1,000 employees in October and said that more cuts were coming. Six hundred employees took severance packages and quit instead of returning to the office, it said.\n\nEllison has also installed Bari Weiss at the top of CBS News. Weiss left The New York Times Opinion section in 2020 and later built the The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance acquired for about $150 million.\n\nEllison continued his spending run. He brought in Netflix veteran Cindy Holland and shelled out $7.7 billion for UFC rights.\n\n\"Everywhere you look, he's throwing money,\" LightShed Partners media analyst Rich Greenfield told Business Insider. \"That's what Hollywood gets excited about.\"\n\nNow, Ellison has his eye on another acquisition: Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount Skydance had earlier entered a competitive bid against Netflix and Comcast to acquire the company.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery ultimately accepted Netflix's bid to purchase the company's streaming and studio business for $72 billion.\n\nEllison is now fighting to stop that from happening. On December 8, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for WBD, offering to pay shareholders $30 per share for the entire company.\n\nThat morning, Ellison made his case to shareholders and WBD's board on CNBC.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"",

    "description": "Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that his winning pitch to Trump for the company to buy Warner Bros. centered on protecting and creating jobs.",
    "fullText": "Before Netflix made its winning bid for Warner Bros., its co-CEO pitched President Donald Trump directly on the merits of the deal.\n\nThe pair found common ground, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said.\n\n\"The president's interests in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said of Trump at the UBS media conference on Monday afternoon.\n\nSarandos said he'd talked to Trump \"many times since the election about the different challenges facing the entertainment industry.\"\n\n\"The president cares deeply about the entertainment industry, and he loves the entertainment industry,\" Sarandos continued.\n\nTrump praised Sarandos on Sunday, calling him a \"great person\" who he said had done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" Still, Trump said Netflix's \"big market share\" in the streaming space \"could be a problem\" as it tries to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.\n\nThe Netflix-Warner Bros. deal reached on Friday is worth $82.7 billion, including $72 billion in equity. WBD's TV networks like CNN or HGTV, aren't in the proposal.\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance responded on Monday with a hostile bid in the form of a $30-per-share, all-cash offer for all of WBD, including the declining TV networks. Netflix's offer is $27.75 per share, comprising mostly cash and some stock. There's debate among analysts about whether Netflix's or Paramount's renewed offer is more attractive, as it depends on the value of WBD's TV networks.\n\nParamount's move \"was entirely expected,\" Sarandos said.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison, who Trump has publicly praised, went on CNBC on Monday morning to tout his company's offer as \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\" Ellison said his company's offer had \"faster regulatory certainty to close\" than Netflix's. Ellison's father, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally and one of the richest people on the planet.\n\nHowever, Netflix also seems to be building rapport with Trump. That could help explain why Netflix's Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters are optimistic about their deal.\n\n\"We are very confident that regulators should, and will, approve it,\" Peters said of the WBD deal.\n\nSarandos pitched the streaming giant's proposed acquisition as a net positive for the labor market, despite the concerns of many in Hollywood. He also said the company is \"deeply committed\" to releasing movies from Warner Bros. in theaters, \"exactly the way they've released those movies today.\"\n\nThat overture could help ease Trump's concerns. Sarandos pitched Netflix as a great job saver.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos warned that Ellison would implement lots of layoffs if his bid won and said the Paramount CEO promised about $6 billion in cost savings from a WBD deal. Those so-called \"synergies,\" in analyst jargon, translate to a smaller workforce, Sarandos said.\n\n\"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,\" Sarandos said. \"We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"\n\nNetflix has promised investors $2 billion to $3 billion in its own cost savings from its Warner Bros. deal, however.",

Discovery to that company's board and shareholders, as well as his own employees.\n\nEllison pitched Paramount employees about his renewed offer to buy WBD in an email sent just after 3 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison wrote in the memo to staffers, which was first obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe Paramount CEO said he believes his all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD is superior to Netflix's $27.75 offer for WBD's streaming and studio assets, including the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, and streamer HBO Max.\n\nParamount made a so-called hostile bid for WBD on Monday morning, hoping to get investors on its side.\n\nEllison is also trying to get his employees on board. He's selling them on a vision where a Paramount-WBD tie-up becomes a powerhouse capable of challenging Netflix and YouTube.\n\n\"Our motivation for pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery has been consistent from the start,\" Ellison wrote in the memo. \"We love this industry and believe deeply in its future.\"\n\nEllison also said that \"storytelling\" is \"one of America's greatest cultural and economic exports.\"\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos similarly made an America-focused pitch when he approached President Donald Trump about the deal, he said at an industry conference on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nNetflix has said its proposal would be best for consumers and the entertainment industry. Paramount has made the opposite argument.\n\nRead Ellison's full memo to Paramount employees below:",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros.

    "title": "What the Netflix/Warner Bros. Merger Could Mean for Streaming",
    "description": "Is HBO Max dead, and will you be able to watch 'Game of Thrones' on Netflix?",
    "fullText": "After initial reporting from The Wrap revealed that Netflix had won the bidding war for Warner Bros., the streamer stepped in on Friday to confirm that it has a deal with the Warner Bros. board to acquire the home of HBO and HBO Max, DC Comics, and Bugs Bunny for $82.7 billion. The acquisition would put an end to merger attempts from the likes of Paramount and Comcast, but it's also far from a done deal.\n\nAccording to Netflix, its acquisition of Warner Bros. will need to wait until at least Q3 2026, to allow room for the previously announced Warner Bros. and Discovery split to go through, as Netflix does not plan to buy the Discovery part of the business (including its cable channels). Additionally, the deal will need to go through regulatory approval. Given these roadblocks, the companies expect \"to close in 12–18 months.\"\n\nThe news of the acquisition follows Warner Bros.' announcement in October that it was open to a sale, at least partially motivated by its split with Discovery.\n\nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. The Wrap reported that Netflix's deal with Warner Bros. includes a $5 billion breakup fee in case regulators block the deal, pointing to some anxiety from both companies. To that end, CNBC reported that \"a senior [Trump] administration official\" has said that the government is looking at the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" and The New York Post and the Wall Street Journal both reported that Paramount (which recently completed its own merger with Skydance Entertainment, led by Trump ally David Ellison) is currently warning the administration away from allowing the deal. To that end, the BBC reported over the weekend that Trump said the merger \"could be a problem.\"\n\nParamount is also not done bidding, it seems. The company announced a $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid this morning, bypassing the board and offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery shares from shareholders at a premium. Notably, if accepted, the deal would include the whole of Warner Bros. Discovery, despite the upcoming split, which would also give Paramount access to cable networks like CNN and TBS. In its announcement, Paramount called out the Netflix deal as facing a \"challenging regulatory approval process,\" implying that it would better be able to negotiate with the administration.\n\nHow regulators will respond to the purchase remains to be seen, but if the deal does go through, it will mark a major shift for both Hollywood and consumers. Netflix hasn't laid out complete plans for how the merger would affects its customers, but in its press release, it has offered a few hints. Should a combined Netflix and Warner Bros. come to pass, here's how you can expect it to affect you.\n\nSince Netflix's primary business is as a streaming app, the most obvious result of a Warner Bros. acquisition would probably be the shuttering of HBO Max, and the inclusion of its content into Netflix proper. However, it seems like we're more likely to get a Disney+/Hulu situation, with the company running both services simultaneously.\n\nIn its post announcing the merger, Netflix said it will \"maintain Warner Bros.' current operations,\" and that HBO and HBO Max would be viewed as a \"compelling, complementary offering\" for its customers.\n\nWhether that means Netflix subscribers will get complementary HBO subscriptions, or if they will simply be able to add HBO onto their plans as complemental \"content,\" is unclear, although I would expect the latter interpretation to be the correct one. After all, Disney charges an additional fee for users who also want to There would be little reason for Netflix to not follow suit.\n\nThis is backed up by another line further into the press release which states that, \"[b]y adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.\" That implies HBO is something you'll add to an existing subscription, rather than content that will just become part of a base Netflix subscription, with the company saying the acquisition \"also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers.\"\n\nNetflix already offers a small smattering of shows originally developed for either HBO or HBO Max, such as Sex and the City and Scavenger's Reign. This is due to pre-existing content sharing agreements, but it's possible Netflix may continue to offer some HBO content to its existing subscribers for free, even if it continues to operate HBO as a separate entity.\n\nFor instance, Netflix says in the merger announcement that \"shows and movies such as The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz and the DC Universe will join Netflix's extensive portfolio.\" While this is likely simply acknowledging acquired IP, I wouldn't be surprised to see some select shows hit Netflix from time to time, either to prop up sparse release schedules or to promote HBO subscriptions/add-ons.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Greg Peters also says in the release that, \"[w]ith our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they [Warner Bros.] create.\" He adds this would be an opportunity to attract, \"more fans to our best-in-class streaming service.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is most known to consumers as an app, its large selection of original content also means that it operates as a production studio. Netflix says that it will use the acquisition of Warner Bros. production side to \"enhance Netflix's studio capabilities, allowing the Company to significantly expand U.S. production.\"\n\nThis means that viewers might expect to see more original Netflix content in the future, specifically more American-made shows in the vein of Stranger Things, alongside localized foreign programming like Squid Game.\n\nAlongside its movie and TV businesses, Netflix will also be acquiring Warner Bros. Games, a spokesperson confirmed to Game Developer. That means the company will now be responsible for publishing both licensed works, such as the Batman Arkham series, as well as gaming originals, like the Mortal Kombat series. Little is known about how Netflix will handle suddenly being in charge of these longstanding AAA series, but given the company's recent gaming ambitions and its promise to continue Warner Bros. operations as usual, it's likely these titles will continue in some capacity.\n\nIn addition to suddenly stepping into big-budget, AAA gaming, Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. also means it's getting control of DC Comics' print business alongside its film and TV businesses, as the publisher is wholly owned by Warner Bros. That's another big step for the company, although given that DC's print business serves largely as the foundation of lucrative IP such as Superman and Batman, it's likely Netflix will do its best to keep operations there as smooth as possible. However, readers might expect some Netflix and DC synergy, similar to when Marvel started publishing new Star Wars comics shortly after Disney acquired Lucasfilm. Batman visiting the Upside-Down from Stranger Things might be more likely than you'd think.\n\nFinally, while Netflix's past movie releases have often relied on direct-to-streaming drops complemented by just enough of a theatrical presence to qualify for awards, Netflix said in its release that it plans to continue distributing Warner Bros. produced movies as usual, \"including theatrical releases for films,\" but that the exclusive theatrical window may shrink. In other words, The Batman 2 probably isn't going to get the Knives Out or KPop Demon Hunters treatment, but theater exclusivity for Warner Bros. movies might not be as long going forward.",
