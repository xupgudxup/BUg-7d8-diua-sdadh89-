    "description": "Season eight of the docuseries will launch on Apple TV and Netflix tonight, with plans to simulcast the Grand Prix in May.",
    "fullText": "In a surprise deal, Apple and Netflix are teaming up for select Formula 1 programming.\n\nThe deal will include Netflix simulcasting the F1 Canadian Grand Prix May 22-24 (it will also be on Apple TV, of course), and with Apple TV getting streaming rights to season eight of Drive to Survive alongside Netflix.\n\nDrive to Survive will land on Apple TV at midnight tonight, the same day it debuts on Netflix.\n\nEddy Cue, Apple’s senior VP of services, announced the deal in a conference call with reporters Thursday.\n\n“Netflix, I think, has played a pivotal role in growing F1 since the launch of Drive to Survive, and we’re thrilled to make F1 content more broadly available to new and existing u.s. fans on both Netflix and Apple TV,” Cue said.\n\nThe deal delivers something for each company: Apple gets F1 shoulder programming that it can place alongside the live races, and expanded reach for its F1 programming through the Canadian Grand Prix simulcast. Netflix, meanwhile, will get live F1 racing in the U.S. in May, continuing its strategy of frequent live event event programming.\n\nIn fact, the Netflix deal is just one of many efforts that Apple is taking to expand the reach of F1 ahead of the season kickoff next month in Melbourne, Australia. As with its deals with MLB and MLS, Apple will be integrating F1 content and programming within its other apps, including in Apple news (which will offer live look-ins to races), Apple Maps, Apple Music, and its other apps.\n\nAnd the company is striking partnerships with third-parties, in addition to Netflix. As previously reported Imax will simulcast some races, and the company will also partner with Fox’s Tubi to stream some “altcasts,” though it is not entirely clear what that will entail.\n\nApple secured F1 rights last year in a deal believed to be valued at $140-$150 million annually. The racing circuit had been with ESPN with years, crediting the sports giant with growing it tremendously.\n\n“They were the one who bet on us in a moment where there was not really a good confidence that we can grow as we are doing as a sport,” F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali told The Hollywood Reporter last year. ESPN parent company Disney and F1 are still in business, with the companies working on consumer products and online comics, as announced earlier Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Update: Shortly after this story was published, Netflix announced that it would not raise its bid for WBD.\n\nParamount Skydance may finally have the upper hand on Netflix in the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe WBD board announced on Thursday afternoon that it believes Paramount's improved offer to buy the entire company for $31 per share is better than Netflix's proposal to buy its streaming and studio assets for $27.75 per share. Both offers are all cash.\n\nParamount's bid also includes a so-called \"ticking fee,\" which will pay WBD shareholders $0.25 per share, or about $650 million, for every quarter that its deal doesn't get regulatory approval, starting September 30.\n\nNetflix now has four business days to raise its bid, if it chooses. It could also decide to walk away and collect a $2.8 billion breakup fee from WBD, which Paramount has said it will cover.\n\n\"While Netflix has the opportunity to increase its bid and reclaim WBD, the bigger question is if it's in Netflix's interest to continue pursuit,\" said Ross Benes, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. \"Netflix and Paramount stocks have taken a hit since this bidding war started. Investors will not be keen on increasing bids further.\"\n\nIf Netflix doesn't improve its offer, WBD's board will formally change its recommendation and kill its Netflix deal. WBD shareholders will vote on March 20 to approve the transaction with the highest bidder.\n\nParamount and Netflix have each been on a mission to convince Hollywood, consumers, and government officials that they'd be the better buyer of Warner Bros.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount is willing to pay WBD a $7 billion breakup fee if its deal is blocked by regulators, a sign of his confidence in winning over the US Department of Justice under President Donald Trump. (Netflix has agreed to pay WBD $5.8 billion if regulators blocked its deal.) Ellison would also need regulatory approval in Europe and could face challenges at the state level in the US.\n\nParamount has warned that Netflix would become an overpowering juggernaut if it bought HBO and the Warner Bros. studio. Netflix has argued that it competes with YouTube and traditional TV, not just paid streamers.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has been on a charm offensive, telling politicians, the creative community, and the public that Netflix would create jobs if it bought Warner Bros. Sarandos visited the White House this week, Politico reported.\n\nTrump said earlier this month he'd stay out of the process, though he said in December that Netflix's market share \"could be a problem.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nTrump, however, said shortly after that Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board and would otherwise \"pay the consequences.\" Rice, who worked in the White House under Obama and Biden, was critical of Trump on a podcast and said companies that bow to him could face retribution. Sarandos downplayed Trump's comments, saying that the company's plan to buy Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"\n\nParamount has promised investors $6 billion in savings if it wins the bidding war, compared to Netflix's target of $2 billion to $3 billion. WBD's board, as recently as last week, expressed concern that could lead to an employee exodus if Paramount won control of the company.",

    "description": "Netflix said it wouldn't pay more for Warner Bros., and the deal was \"no longer financially attractive,\" two days after Paramount increased its offer.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has won the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNetflix said Thursday it won't raise its bid, paving the way for Paramount to buy WBD and become a Hollywood behemoth.\n\nThe decision comes two days after Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share for all of WBD, including its cable networks like CNN and HGTV. WBD's board said Thursday that Paramount's latest offer was better than Netflix's proposal to buy its streaming and studio assets — including Warner Bros. and HBO Max — for $27.75 per share.\n\n\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.\"\n\nNetflix will now pocket a $2.8 billion breakup fee paid by WBD, which Paramount has said it will reimburse.\n\nNetflix investors seem thrilled. The stock surged by more than 10% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Paramount shares jumped about 5%.\n\nWBD shares slipped 1.8%, a potential sign that shareholders were counting on an even bigger bidding war.\n\nA combination of Paramount and WBD could create a true rival to Hollywood leaders Netflix and Disney. However, despite its size, it would still face the daunting task of transitioning legacy media assets — including declining cable TV networks — to a new era dominated by streaming and social media.\n\n\"We are excited about the potential of a combined Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery and can't wait to get started working together telling the stories that move the world,\" WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a statement.\n\nEllison has relentlessly pursued WBD for months, making 10 official offers for the company. His pursuit of WBD has been backed by his father, Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of cloud giant Oracle.\n\nParamount already owns its iconic movie studio, Paramount+, CBS, and TV networks like MTV and Comedy Central.\n\nIf Paramount's WBD deal secures regulatory approvals, it will get the Warner Bros. studio, HBO, HBO Max, and cable networks like CNN, TNT, and HGTV, plus the Discovery+ streaming service.\n\nThough the combination would make Ellison a Hollywood heavyweight, his company would still fall behind Netflix in a few key metrics.\n\nHBO Max had 131.6 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter, while Paramount+ had 78.9 million paid subscribers as of late 2025.\n\nNetflix crossed 325 million subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nWBD's streaming services accounted for 1.4% TV share on US TVs in January, according to Nielsen, compared to 2.3% for Paramount's streamers. For comparison, Netflix was at 8.8% while Disney's streamers got 4.9%.\n\nOne side plot is that CNN may soon find itself with the same corporate parent as CBS News, which Ellison has begun to remake by installing the polarizing Bari Weiss as its editor in chief.\n\nParamount has framed itself as a better buyer for WBD than Netflix, which it said would wield unhealthy sway over competitors and consumers if it bought HBO and gained access to iconic IP like DC Comics' Batman.\n\nNetflix argued that it would be a better caretaker of Warner Bros. by laying off fewer staffers than Paramount would, while creating TV jobs in a Hollywood plagued by fewer productions. Paramount has promised investors $6 billion in cost savings from the deal.\n\nBoth Netflix and Paramount have angled for support from regulators and President Donald Trump. Paramount is willing to pay WBD a $7 billion breakup fee if its deal is blocked, a sign of Ellison's confidence in regulatory approval.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider in mid-February that Trump had \"great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference\" for Netflix or Paramount.\n\nHowever, Netflix caught Trump's ire days later, with the president saying that the streaming giant must remove board member Susan Rice \"or pay the consequences.\" Rice, a White House official during the Obama and Biden administrations, appeared on a podcast and criticized Trump and companies she believes chose to \"take a knee\" to the president.\n\nSarandos previously downplayed Trump's comments, saying the Netflix-Warner Bros. tie-up is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance just revised its bid for WBD. David Ellison's new offer could put pressure on Netflix to change its own.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison's Paramount Skydance has revised its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, putting pressure on Netflix to follow suit.\n\nParamount did not publicly share a price for its revised bid, which is its 10th. The company's previous offer was for $30 per share.\n\nWBD told shareholders last week that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that its previous bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal.\n\n\"Following engagement with PSKY during the seven-day limited waiver period, we received a revised PSKY proposal to acquire WBD, which we are reviewing in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\" WBD said in a statement on Tuesday. \"We will update our shareholders following the Board's review. The Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction. WBD shareholders are advised not to take any action at this time with respect to the amended PSKY tender offer.\"\n\nIf WBD's board determines that Paramount's latest offer is \"potentially superior or superior\" to Netflix's, then Netflix would have four days to improve its offer, a person familiar with the deal process said.\n\nWBD previously turned down Paramount's offers and decided to sell key assets, including its studio and HBO, to Netflix for $27.75 per share. The Netflix deal doesn't include WBD's cable channels, such as HGTV and TNT, unlike Paramount's bid.\n\nA higher Paramount offer should come as little surprise, despite Ellison saying his previous bid was \"superior to Netflix's.\" Paramount had sweetened its offer several times before this latest one.\n\nThe Paramount head honcho was also overheard saying in mid-December that WBD's board couldn't accept his $30-per-share bid without \"admitting breach of fiduciary duty,\" Business Insider reported. That's because it was the same offer the WBD board — which has a duty to act in the best interest of shareholders — had previously rejected.\n\nAll this suggested that an upgraded bid could be in the works.\n\nWBD had raised several issues with Paramount's previous offers, including that its equity wasn't fully backstopped by Larry Ellison and its termination fee was lower than Netflix's. Paramount addressed both points. WBD then said there would be additional costs it would incur if it accepted Paramount's bid, such as a $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix, which Paramount said it had accounted for in its ninth bid.\n\nA key part of Paramount's argument is that WBD's TV networks aren't worth much, if anything, after factoring in debt and the trading price of Versant, a similar company.\n\nNetflix, for its part, is pitching itself as a better option for shareholders and the entertainment industry, and has said that a Netflix-Warner Bros. tie-up would \"create and protect jobs.\"\n\nThe merger would have to go through an antitrust review. One wild card is President Donald Trump. Last week, a White House spokesperson told Business Insider that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nThen, on Saturday, Trump called for Netflix to remove Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\" During a podcast appearance, Rice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, had made comments critical of the Trump administration and corporations that \"take a knee.\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos downplayed the president's comments on Monday and added that their bid for Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"\n\nRegardless of who wins between Netflix and Paramount, a bidding war would benefit WBD shareholders. Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, predicted in December that the battle between Netflix and Paramount could raise the cost to buy WBD by $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nEven if WBD's board rejects Paramount for a 10th time, Ellison can continue to make bids up until WBD's shareholder vote on March 20.",

    "fullText": "Christian Horner has spoken out about his exit from Red Bull Racing during the eighth season of Netflix's Drive to Survive.\n\nThe docuseries, which will be released on 27 February, will follow the on and off track stories of the 2025 Formula 1 season. The fourth episode, titled A Bull With No Horns, will cover Horner's exit from Red Bull.\n\nAfter being with the team since it joined the grid in 2005, Horner was replaced as Red Bull Racing CEO and team principal in July 2025 by former Racing Bulls team principal Laurent Mekies. The Briton has now had the opportunity to speak about his exit, which he believes was the decision of Oliver Mintzlaff and Helmut Marko.\n\n\"I feel a real sense of loss and hurt. It was all rather sudden. I didn't really get a chance to say a proper goodbye,\" Horner said on Drive to Survive.\n\n\"I never imagined to be in this position. Of course, your immediate reaction when you get delivered a s**t sandwich like that is like, f**k them. I've had something taken away from me that wasn't my choice, that was very precious to me.\n\n\"I only ever gave my best. I did my best for my team, for the people that I represented. But performance this year hasn't been as strong as previously.\"\n\nWhen asked if he thought the Verstappens had anything to do with the decision, Horner added: \"[Max Verstappen's] father has never been my biggest fan. He's been outspoken about me. But I don't believe that the Verstappens were responsible in any way.\n\n\"I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff, with Helmut advising from the sideline. I think ultimately things changed within the business, within the group. The founder died. And after Dietrich's death, I think probably I was deemed to have maybe too much control.\"\n\nThere have been rumours about Horner returning to the championship following his exit, although a comeback is yet to be confirmed.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Feb 23 (Reuters) - Paramount Skydance submitted a higher offer for Warner Bros Discovery, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, ratcheting up efforts to derail the HBO Max owner's deal with Netflix.\n\nThe bidding war for one of Hollywood's most coveted assets including the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Game of Thrones\" franchises has raised ‌the stakes for dominance in the streaming-led market.\n\nHow does Netflix's bid compare to Paramount's proposal?\n\nWhy is Warner Bros Discovery a coveted acquisition target?\n\nWhat regulatory challenges could block these merger deals?\n\nWhat are the key details of Paramount's revised offer?\n\nParamount's new bid — which improves its initial offer of $108.4 billion, or $30 per share, for the whole company — seeks to address Warner Bros ‌concerns about the certainty of its financing, the source said.\n\nWarner Bros' chosen suitor Netflix, which offered to buy ​the studios and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in cash, or $82.7 billion, is allowed to match the latest bid from David Ellison-led Paramount.\n\nNetflix has ample cash and could bump up its offer for HBO Max owner, while Paramount's rival bid is backed by Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison.\n\nThe CBS parent was asked to submit its \"best and final offer\" after Warner Bros rejected an enhanced bid that included paying the $2.8 billion in termination fee to Netflix and adding a 25-cent per share quarterly \"ticking fee\" from next year to compensate Warner Bros shareholders for any delay in deal closure.\n\nWarner Bros had said Paramount's February 10 offer still falls short ‌of what its board would consider a superior proposal and gave ⁠a seven-day deadline until February 23 to submit a revised offer.\n\nMoffettNathanson analysts had earlier said that an offer in the range of $34 per share from Paramount would end the bidding war and \"avoid further debate over Discovery Global's value.\"\n\nWarner Bros plans to spin off Discovery Global, which holds cable TV assets such as ⁠CNN and HGTV, could fetch between $1.33 and $6.86 a share, according to Warner Bros estimates.\n\nNetflix said its offer gives Warner Bros shareholders added upside from the Discovery Global spinoff, which WBD argues will add value by giving the new company greater strategic, operational and financial flexibility.\n\nHowever, Paramount has said the cable spinoff central to the streaming giant's offer is effectively worthless.\n\nThe David Zaslav-led Warner Bros came under pressure from Ancora Capital after the activist investor ​built ​a roughly $200 million stake in the HBO owner and accused the company of failing to adequately engage with ​Paramount.",

    "description": "Paramount is in a bidding war with Netflix for Warner Bros. and has until March to make its best and final offer.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance is staring down a key deadline in its pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, but it doesn't need to make a move quite yet.\n\nDavid Ellison and company have been able to negotiate directly with WBD's leadership team in recent days for the first time in months — thanks to Netflix, Paramount's rival in the bidding war.\n\nNetflix granted WBD, its deal partner, a weeklong waiver on negotiation exclusivity that expires at midnight on Monday. The company said it hoped these talks between Paramount and WBD would \"fully and finally resolve\" the monthslong saga that it said has been an \"ongoing distraction\" for both Netflix and WBD shareholders.\n\nAs of midday Monday, Paramount hasn't made its \"best and final\" bid for WBD, though it doesn't necessarily have to rush. That's because the seven-day window that Netflix granted Warner Bros. is to talk with Paramount, not the deadline for Paramount to raise its bid.\n\n\"Anyone can make an offer up to the shareholder vote,\" a person familiar with the WBD-Paramount negotiations told Business Insider.\n\nWBD's shareholder vote is on March 20. At that meeting, investors can choose to either approve or reject the Netflix deal, or they can abstain. WBD shareholders who prefer Paramount's offer can tender their shares to Ellison and company. Paramount has set a March 2 deadline for that, though it could be extended. If Paramount gets a majority of shares, it could shift WBD's course toward its own offer over Netflix's.\n\nThat means Paramount's real deadline for submitting its best offer is weeks away, though the company could raise its bid well before that. If Paramount raises its offer, Netflix will have four days to respond.\n\nWBD has said it prefers Netflix's all-cash offer of $27.75 per share for its studio and streaming assets over Paramount's proposal of $30 per share for the entire company, including its cable TV networks.\n\nWBD warned last week that if it went with Paramount, its employees could quit in droves, ahead of what could be a major round of layoffs under Ellison. Paramount has said it plans to create $6 billion in cost savings, which would include layoffs, compared to $2 billion or $3 billion from Netflix.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix is the biggest threat to Hollywood since it has the most streaming subscribers and dominates viewership share among paid streamers. Netflix's counterargument is that it also competes against YouTube and other free streamers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is another variable. Trump said in December that Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem\" due to its market share, before saying in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the regulatory process.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nThen on Saturday, Trump said Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\" On a podcast, Rice, a former senior White House official under Obama and Biden, criticized the Trump administration and companies that \"take a knee\" under pressure from the president.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos shrugged off the president's remarks on Monday, saying that the streaming titan's bid for Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "description": "Governance watchers say Susan Rice's critique of Donald Trump is complicating Netflix's bid for Warner Bros., while others call her stance principled.",
    "fullText": "A corporate board seat can bring status and stock awards — and also political heat.\n\nThe criticism that Netflix board member Susan Rice leveled at President Donald Trump last week is dividing governance watchers over how political a corporate director can afford to be.\n\nRice, who served in top roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, made several critical remarks about the commander in chief during an appearance on the podcast \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara.\" Trump responded by demanding that Netflix remove her from her seat \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nThe spat has come at a precarious time for the video-streaming company. Netflix's pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery— an $82.7 billion bid — could reshape Hollywood, but it requires approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nWhile Rice's actions didn't break any laws, governance experts who spoke with Business Insider were split over whether she crossed a line.\n\nDirectors would be wise to keep their personal views about politics and other sensitive topics out of the public eye, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Their fiduciary responsibility is to serve in the company's best interests, and Rice's remarks ran counter to that duty, he said.\n\n\"It's poor judgment. And you're elected as a director for your judgment,\" Elson said. \"She has to ask herself, 'Am I a public figure or am I a corporate director?'\"\n\nElson, himself a director, said he avoids publicly staking out political positions. \"I just don't think it's in my lane,\" he said.\n\nTrump's threat of retaliation, however, didn't align with the kind of conduct normally expected of a sitting president, either, said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\n\"It's really important to recognize that what Susan Rice was calling out is exactly the behavior that Trump responded with,\" she said. \"Trump's reaction just points out how important what she has to say is.\"\n\nRice spoke critically of Trump at length on the podcast, suggesting her remarks were intentional rather than off the cuff.\n\n\"This might have felt like the hill that she was ready to die on, metaphorically,\" added Pozner. \"It's definitely risky for her politically. It's definitely risky for the Netflix deal, but it also seems like such a principled stance that it ought to be respected by most people.\"\n\nRice, Netflix, and the White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt is possible that Rice warned Netflix's leadership about the podcast and got its blessing behind the scenes. Ted Sarandos, the company's co-CEO, referred to its bid for Warner Bros. as a \"business deal\" on the BBC's Today program on Monday. \"It's not a political deal,\" he said.\n\nStill, Rice's public and partisan tongue-lashing is unusual for a director on a major corporate board. It could make companies reconsider whether to put political figures on their boards, Elson said.\n\n\"Obviously, someone coming out of public service has a lot of experience, a lot of intelligence,\" said Elson. But, he added, \"Are you retired or not?\"\n\nThe incident could further discourage corporate leaders from speaking their minds in public, said Pozner. The president has repeatedly targeted critics, publicly calling for boycotts of companies and attacking business figures who challenge him.\n\n\"I think it will have a dampening effect on public speech,\" said Pozner.\n\nGovernance experts say the incident should serve as a case study for corporate boardrooms.\n\n\"Every company in America that has a pending regulatory approval should be watching the case,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International.\n\n\"The lesson isn't: Don't have political opinions. The lesson is: Understand when your company is at peak vulnerability and govern that accordingly. … Time really does matter.\"\n\nCompanies may be able to prevent directors from causing a similar kerfuffle, said Akubuiro, by enacting quiet periods during sensitive moments. These would be similar to how leaders are expected to clam up in the weeks leading up to companies' quarterly earnings reports.\n\n\"You just want to recognize that in a politicized moment, anything that's quasi-political can become a weapon, and folks will use that against you for maximum leverage,\" Akubuiro said.\n\nSimilarly, companies need defined communication policies that set expectations for directors, especially when regulatory stakes are high, and outline what to do if a board member goes off script, said Jennifer Schielke, CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions.\n\n\"The boardroom should be designed for robust dissent that is productive and private,\" she said.\n\nIn a fractious political environment, it's prudent for board members to get counsel and to consider the potential costs and benefits of what they say, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nYet, she added, \"That is completely different from being cowed into not saying anything.\"\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

It's not a political deal,\" Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, told the BBC's Today program on Monday, referring to the company's bid to buy Warner Bros. \"This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the US, and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.\"\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump called on Netflix to fire Rice, a former US ambassador and national security advisor in the Obama and Biden administrations, from its board of directors.\n\nTrump was responding to comments Rice made in a podcast about corporations that \"take a knee to Trump,\" warning that they could face retribution from a future Democratic administration.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC how big a deal it was for the president to weigh in on Rice, Sarandos said: \"He likes to do a lot of things on social media.\"\n\nIt comes at a delicate time for Netflix, which is battling Paramount to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. A deal would require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump had said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal.

Discovery earlier gave Paramount a seven-day window to submit a new offer, which expires at the end of Monday.\n\nOn February 17, WBD told shareholders that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that the bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal.

    "description": "Trump shares statement from Laura Loomer calling on president to kill Netflix deal",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reposted a message calling Michelle Obama a “racist” and ranted against a former high-ranking official in Barack Obama’s administration as he prepares to face Democrats in Congress at the State of the Union address.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president reposted a message from far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer describing the former first lady as an “anti-white racist.” In his own caption, the president took aim at another Black woman in the same administration: former White House adviser Susan Rice.\n\nThreatening Netflix to fire Rice, who serves on the company’s executive board, Trump wrote: “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”\n\nLoomer’s post was must more extensive and urged the president to kill an upcoming merger between Warner Bros. and Netflix, which the far-right activist feared would expand the Obamas’ influence within both companies. The former president and his wife own a production company, Higher Ground Productions, which produces a variety of content on Neftlix’s platform.\n\nOf the Obamas, Loomer wrote: “[P]ositive messaging of the Democrats' upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama ... and his anti-White racist wife Michelle ... would likely be blasted across all streaming services as the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions continues to grow within Netflix.”\n\nThe two posts came in response to Rice warning that companies seen as guilty of cozying up to the Trump administration would face consequences of their own if Democratic lawmakers retake the House and Senate in midterm elections this fall — along with the White House in 2028.\n\nShe made the comments on a podcast hosted by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney fired by Trump during his first term.\n\n“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.\n\nTrump’s apparent support for Loomer’s description of Michelle Obama as “racist” comes as he has continues to refuse to apologize for a scandal that enveloped him this month around the posting of a bizarre AI video from his Truth Social account depicting her and her husband as apes.\n\nThe racist depiction of the nation’s first Black president was immediately condemned by politicians on both sides of the aisle, forcing the White House to offer a defense, then walk it back entirely and delete the post.\n\nRepublicans on the Hill were clearly uncomfortable with the video and called its posting a mistake. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, called it racist.\n\nThe former president responded on a podcast, stating that “it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.\n\nTrump has blamed the post on a staffer who has access his Truth Social account, Natalie Harp, whom he said did not watch the video fully before posting it to his account.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Air Force One, Trump claimed to have watched part of the video and sent it to his team for review and a possible post on his account. He denied seeing the part of the video where the former president and former first lady appeared.\n\n“I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t and they posted it. And then we deleted it,” said Trump.\n\nThis isn’t the first time he’s taken content or advice directly from Loomer, either.\n\nThe far-right activist found herself with new access to the Oval Office in 2025 as Trump returned to the White House and used it to direct a purge of figures tied to Michael Waltz, then-Trump’s national security adviser, for supposed disloyalty.\n\nLoomer has also supported a loyalty-driven purge of officials across other parts of the government, with one notable victim being the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. His daughter, Maurene, was fired from the Department of Justice in July.\n\nThrough her constant, vitriolic attacks on Democrats, Loomer has faced her own accusations of racism, including in the fall of 2025, when she was widely condemned for hurling a racist slur at Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, whom she called a “ghetto Black B****.”",

    "description": "The president now routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply.",
    "fullText": "Netflix wants President Donald Trump's stamp of approval as it maneuvers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNow, Trump has a demand for Netflix: unseat board member Susan Rice.\n\nIn normal times, we would all be marveling at the spectacle of the US president telling a company in the midst of a merger fight (Paramount also wants to buy Warner Bros. Discovery) how to structure its board. During Trump 2.0, though, this has become standard stuff. Trump routinely tells companies to fire someone he doesn't like or do something he does like.\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump always gets what he wants. The demands alone, however, are an extraordinary use of power. We should make sure we don't become inured to it.\n\nTrump's Truth Social post is a reminder that the future of Warner Bros. Discovery will run through the White House, no matter what Trump says at any given moment. (Refresher: In December, Trump said, \"I'll be involved\" in the fight between Netflix and Paramount. Earlier this month, he announced that \"I've decided I shouldn't be involved.\" Now he's telling Netflix it will \"pay the consequences\" if it doesn't fire Rice, which sure seems like he's involved again.)\n\nTrump himself doesn't have the authority to stop Warner Bros. Discovery from selling itself to Netflix or Paramount, which is controlled by David Ellison and his father, the prominent Trump supporter, Larry Ellison. He can, however, instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue to stop a deal on antitrust grounds.\n\nModern presidents have traditionally assumed an arm's-length distance from federal law enforcement. And it's entirely possible that any other president's Department of Justice would also look into an antitrust case against Netflix, given its enormous market power.\n\nTrump, however, has made it clear that he expects Bondi to act on his behalf. So if he doesn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, he can certainly make it more difficult for them.\n\nWhich makes it puzzling that Rice, who held senior roles in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations, would sound off on a podcast, announcing that \"elites\" and \"corporate interests\" who accommodated Trump would one day \"be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nThis wasn't a mere gaffe or misstatement. She went on at length. It was, regardless of how she intended it, a provocation aimed at the Trump White House — at the exact moment the company she's supposed to help govern is seeking Trump's approval.\n\nI've asked Netflix for comment on Rice's comments and Trump's response.\n\nWe should also note that Trump's most consistent trait is his inconsistency and that he frequently reverses himself. Last summer, for instance, he announced that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly CONFLICTED\" and must resign. Days later, Trump met with Tan and described him as a \"success.\" Weeks after that, the US government acquired 10% of Intel.\n\nNor does Trump always follow through. Last fall, he demanded that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, an executive who had also worked for Clinton, Obama, and Biden. Monaco still works for Microsoft.\n\nHowever, just because we don't know how serious Trump is about pushing Rice out of Netflix — or how his administration will ultimately rule on the Netflix/Paramount race — doesn't mean we should shrug this off.\n\nWe're in a place where the president routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply. If we get used to that, we shouldn't be surprised when future presidents decide they can do it, too.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "description": "David Ronca's cancer battle reshaped his career, including at Netflix. He learned to prioritize work-life balance and intentional productivity.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with David Ronca, a retired video systems engineer. He spent 12 years at Netflix and six years at Meta. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy time at a startup in the early years of my engineering career was like a really bad relationship.\n\nI joined a company that specialized in video playback around 2000. I loved working on video. I consider those seven years like going to school, and I came out with a Ph.D. in practical video systems. But it was the hardest seven years I've ever had in terms of work demands.\n\nI was told when I joined that it would be really important that you're seen around here a lot. So I would work until 7, 8, 9 — sometimes until 10 p.m. Then we started hitting delivery schedules, and I was getting to work around 10 in the morning and going home sometimes at 2:30 in the morning. We're talking 14-hours days, six to seven days a week. Eighty hours a week would've been a break.\n\nWe didn't have good direction. We'd be four or five months into solving a hard problem before leadership would stop us and say, \"Go work on this instead.\" It was madness.\n\nWe were using work hours to compensate for really bad decisions.\n\nIn January 2004, I started feeling ill. On a Sunday, I didn't feel so good, and by midweek, I got worse.\n\nOn Friday night, January 17, my wife took me to the emergency room. The doctor told me, \"This is likely colon cancer.\" After the first surgery, he said, \"There's no way you have a tumor like this and it's not cancer.\"\n\nTwo weeks earlier, I had been running and feeling great. Within a week, I was in a hospital bed on machines.\n\nIt took another week before doctors could do the full surgery. And you spend that time with no idea what they're going to find. That was a very dark week.\n\nMy mother died of breast cancer when she was 48. I was 16. Now, I'm in the hospital at 44. I remember thinking, \"History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.\"\n\nMy wife would bring the three kids. My oldest, who was seven, would sit quietly in the room with me. My youngest was two years old. He didn't really know me.\n\nI was looking at my young son, thinking he's going to grow up without a dad.\n\nAfter surgery, they told me it was stage 3 colon cancer. They removed 60% of my colon. There was lymph node metastasis. My five-year survival prognosis was about 25%.\n\nI went back to work part-time at first.\n\nI was told that I had used up all my sick leave and vacation and was put on California disability, which is around $200 a week.\n\nI told my boss, \"I'm sorry, I will not do this. I still want to work here, but if I have to leave, I will quit. Because I will not work like this.\"\n\nFrom that point on, I didn't. And that was the irony of it all.\n\nI feel like I did some of my best engineering after that. The real change was that I was no longer wasting my brainpower and my thinking on junk.\n\nYou don't do good work after 12 hours. You can't work sustained all-nighters and be productive. The quality of your work is going to suck. I don't care who you are. For most mere mortals, you try to work those hours, you're just not going to be doing good work.\n\nI also started making intentional decisions for life, not just work.\n\nI coached soccer for all three of my kids. I went to their games. My daughter did ballet, and we were there all the time. We started planning and taking family vacations — hiking in the mountains, RV road trips, and Maui.\n\nI realized you have to work to have a life, but you have to have a life to work. So you want to stand in the middle of those things.\n\nIn 2007, after several clean scans, I joined Netflix. I delayed accepting the offer until I got my scan report. I didn't want to change jobs yet because if you have positive liver metastasis, you'd be lucky to get two years.\n\nIn my interview, Patty McCord, the chief talent officer at the time, told me, \"We don't value 24/7 work. You won't be successful here working all the time.\"\n\nThat was almost foreign to me. But it also didn't mean we didn't work hard.\n\nAt Netflix, I was part of the early streaming team — maybe 12 to 16 people. We made aggressive schedules, and we didn't miss them. We launched a Netflix app on the original iPad on Day One within two months.\n\nThe culture at the company was: If you have to work 24/7 for us to be successful, you've got a problem, and we've got a problem, and we're going to fix it.\n\nEven at Meta, my favorite poster had a silhouette of a rocking horse that said, \"Don't mistake motion for progress.\"\n\nIn other words, high performance is not measured by how much work you do. It's measured by how impactful your results are.\n\nThis is not to say that it's wrong to work more than eight hours. Instead, you should understand why you're working more hours. It should be intentional. Intentional exceptions.\n\nIf I were to tell my younger self anything, it would be to make work-life balance part of your DNA. Learn to take time off.\n\nDon't wait until you have cancer or some other near-death experience to realize this.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is calling on Netflix to remove former US Ambassador and national security advisor Susan Rice from its board, sharpening his criticism of the streaming giant as it seeks to merge with Warner Bros. Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump demanded that Netflix \"immediately terminate\" Rice from its board of directors, \"or pay the consequences,\" amplifying a message from right-wing activist Laura Loomer. Loomer had urged action against Rice, criticizing her role at the company and pointing to recent remarks she made about Trump and corporate America.\n\nRice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, recently warned companies against aligning themselves too closely with Trump. Speaking on Thursday on the \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara\" podcast, she said corporations that \"take a knee\" to the president and break the law should expect consequences, predicting an \"accountability agenda\" if Democrats take back power.\n\nThe clash comes as the streaming giant pursues a high-stakes merger that will require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nTrump in December said that Netflix had a \"very big market share,\" so its potential acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\"\n\nHowever, in February, he said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal and would defer to his Department of Justice to investigate the proposed merger, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEarlier this week, during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast, Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, said that Trump hadn't asked for political concessions during discussions of the possible deal, but was focused on bringing jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.\n\nRepresentatives for Netflix and Rice did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump called on Netflix to fire one of its board members, Susan Rice, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser, following comments she made about accountability when Democrats return to power.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Saturday, “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT”\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nTrump Indicates He’s Really Not Into Netflix Buying WB, Wants To Stop The Streamer’s So-Called “Cultural Takeover”\n\n'Real Time': Bill Maher Responds To Trump's Truth Social Rant, Jokes POTUS Expected Him To \"Put Out\" After Dinner\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThis week, Rice appeared on Preet Bharara’s podcast and said that, for corporate interests, law firms and media, “it is not going to end well for them. For those that decided that they would act in their perceived, very narrow self interest, which I would underscore as very short-term self-interest, and take a knee to Trump, I think they are now starting to realize, ‘Wait a minute, this is not popular. Trump is not popular.'”\n\nShe said that “there is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down. They are going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.”\n\nShe added, “If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, ‘Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,’ I think they got another thing coming.”\n\nReferring to Democrats, she said, “We are not going to play by the old set of rules when these guys are playing by a different set of rules. We are going to play by the law. We are not going to violate the law like they did. But we are not going to be suckers.”\n\nTrump linked to a post from Laura Loomer, who has for months lashed out at Netflix along with other MAGA influencers against the streaming giant’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros., citing in part the its ties to Barack Obama. Rice served as U.S. ambassador the the United Nations in Obama’s first term and national security adviser in his second.\n\nTrump told NBC News earlier this month that he would not be involved in deciding whether his administration will give regulatory approval to a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal or a competing bid from Paramount for all of Warner Bros. Discovery. But he previously said he would be involved, despite the long-held political norm of presidents keeping at arms’ length from the Justice Department.\n\nTrump has publicly offered praise for Ted Sarandos, the Netflix co-CEO, after meeting with him multiple times, including at a White House visit in November.\n\nSarandos appeared before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee at a hearing earlier this month, where he was pressed on the competitive impact of the transaction. But several Republicans on the committee pressed Sarandos on culture war issues, including content featuring transgender individuals, even though the DOJ is reviewing the merger for antitrust issues.\n\nParamount, meanwhile, has ties to Trump that include his longtime friend and investor, Larry Ellison, and his son, Skydance founder and the merged company’s CEO, David Ellison. Paramount’s chief legal officer, Makan Delrahim, led the DOJ antitrust division during Trump’s first term.\n\nRice’s point — that Democrats will hold companies accountable if they regain power — was underscored this week when a group of senators fired off a letter to David Ellison, asking him to preserve documents after he declined to answer questions about Paramount’s dealings with Trump.\n\nNetflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.

    "description": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump has spoken about wanting to bring jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.",
    "fullText": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump is all business as the Department of Justice weighs the streaming giant's potential acquisition of Warner Bros.\n\n\"The only thing we talk about is how to keep jobs in America, how to keep the production industry healthy,\" Sarandos said of his talks with Trump during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast.\n\nTrump \"wants to know what happened in California,\" Sarandos said in the podcast episode, referencing the state's film and TV production decline.\n\nHollywood has increasingly gone outside Los Angeles to make movies and shows in recent years, lured by tax credits in places ranging from Atlanta to the United Kingdom.\n\nOn-location shooting days for movies and TV shows in the LA area fell 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to a study from FilmLA Research published in mid-January. This production drop has hurt LA's creative community.\n\nTrump previously floated the idea of imposing tariffs on movies and shows made outside the US, though it's unclear how an import tax could apply to creative services.\n\nNetflix has been on a charm campaign to convince the president and Hollywood that it would be a better buyer of Warner Bros. than rival bidder Paramount Skydance.\n\nA key part of Netflix's pitch is that it would cut fewer jobs than Paramount. Paramount has said it's planning to create $6 billion in so-called synergies, which would likely include layoffs, while Netflix has told investors it's aiming for $2 billion to $3 billion in cost cuts, in part by saving money on licensing programming.\n\nWBD's board of directors seems sympathetic to Netflix's argument. The board warned shareholders that if it accepted Paramount's offer, there could be an exodus of employees seeking to avoid layoffs.\n\nAntitrust analysis often focuses on how strong a company is relative to its competitors and how the market power it could wield over consumers. Regulators also look at how a merger or acquisition would impact the production side, which in this case would be how many studios are competing to buy new movies or shows.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix, the largest paid streaming service with over 325 million subscribers, would become too powerful if it bought the Warner Bros. studio and HBO assets. Netflix has downplayed those concerns, saying that it also competes against YouTube and traditional TV for attention.\n\nTrump said in December that Netflix had a \"very big market share\" so buying Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\" However, the president said in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" and would defer to his Department of Justice.\n\n\"We do not discuss private conversations that may or may not have happened, but President Trump has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nNetflix's co-CEO said Trump hadn't asked him for political concessions relating to the Warner Bros deal.\n\n\"We're not talking about doing anybody any favors or anything else,\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos has long donated to Democrats, and Netflix is often seen by Republicans as a left-leaning company, as evidenced by the grilling Sarandos got during his visit to Capitol Hill in early February.\n\nNotably, Paramount is run by David Ellison and is financially backed by his father, Larry Ellison, a mega-billionaire who has long supported Trump. The younger Ellison has also built rapport with Trump, as the president said last year that Paramount's CEO was \"great\" and would \"do a great job\" running the Hollywood institution.\n\nIf Trump doesn't pick a side, however, those relationships may not help the Ellisons win the battle for Warner Bros.",

    "description": "Gordon Ramsay and his wife, Tana, have six children together. The chef shares a peek at his family life in his new Netflix show \"Being Gordon Ramsay.\"",
    "fullText": "Gordon Ramsay may be famous for his foul-mouthed persona on TV, but behind the scenes, he's a proud father of six.\n\nThe Michelin-starred chef has been married to cookbook author Cayetana \"Tana\" Ramsay since 1996. Together, they have three sons and three daughters, including Holly Ramsay, who was walked down the aisle by her father at her star-studded wedding to Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty in December. Naturally, Ramsay designed the menu.\n\nRamsay shared a glimpse of his family life in his six-episode Netflix series \"Being Gordon Ramsay,\" which premiered on Wednesday.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the celebrity chef's wife and kids.\n\nCayetana \"Tana\" Elizabeth Hutcheson was in her early 20s — and engaged to someone else — when she met Gordon Ramsay at a New Year's Eve party in London, but she didn't think much of him at first, she told The Guardian in 2008. However, they shared a mutual friend and, after bumping into each other again, started dating.\n\nIn 1996, when Gordon was 29 and Tana was 21, they got married in Chelsea, London.\n\nAfter initially struggling to conceive and going through in vitro fertilization, they welcomed their first child, Megan, in 1998. By 2001, their first four children had been born.\n\nSpeaking to The Herald in 2008, Tana said they were surprised by how quickly their family grew.\n\n\"We knew we wanted a large family,\" she said, \"but for it to happen that close together is amazing. When I discovered I was expecting [our fourth child] Tilly, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God, how am I going to manage?' But you do.\"\n\nTana, who initially trained as a teacher, is also accomplished in the kitchen. She's published several cookbooks, including \"Tana's Kitchen Secrets\" and \"Tana Ramsay's Real Family Food.\"\n\nMegan Ramsay, 27, was the first in her family to graduate from college, her dad shared on Instagram at the time. She earned a degree from Oxford Brookes University in June 2019.\n\n\"So proud of this young Lady,\" he wrote alongside photos of Megan in her cap and gown, adding, \"hard work pays off!\"\n\nWhile she generally avoids the spotlight, Megan did appear on a 2021 episode of \"Hell's Kitchen\" to celebrate her 21st birthday alongside her father.\n\nAnd while she keeps a low profile, that didn't stop Ramsay from publicly disparaging her boyfriend.\n\nDuring a January 2022 appearance on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" Ramsay said Megan's ex-boyfriend, Byron, was \"a bit wet.\"\n\n\"You want a man to date your daughter, and he was just a little bit pathetic,\" he added.\n\nBut the Michelin-starred chef can be a doting dad, too. On Megan's 24th birthday in May 2022, he shared a photograph on Instagram showing the two together.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to this gorgeous lady,\" he captioned the photo. \"Words can't describe enough how proud you make me feel every day.\"\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Holly Anna Ramsay and Jack Scott Ramsay were born. They arrived seven weeks early, according to Hello! magazine.\n\nIn an Instagram post in December 2020, Tana recalled her struggles as a mother to premature twins.\n\n\"Seeing them become little chubby, healthy babies within the first year was a true blessing and I will always be grateful for the determination they showed and their feisty characters,\" she wrote.\n\nToday, the twins have a close relationship, but their professional interests differ.\n\nHolly Ramsay is a mental health advocate, podcast and documentary producer, influencer, and model. She has over 500,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nIn 2021, Holly launched the podcast \"21 & Over\" and opened up about her mental health journey, disclosing that she is a survivor of sexual assault.\n\n\"I went to university, studied fashion design, and I loved it. But by the second half of the first year I was being affected by my PTSD and I had no idea that this was happening,\" she said of the aftermath.\n\nOn December 27, 2025, Holly married Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty. She changed into her mother's 1996 wedding gown for their first dance.\n\nDuring an interview with Vogue, Holly said her father would get emotional every time she talked about the wedding.\n\n\"The other day I was asking him which car he and I would take to the church, and he welled up immediately,\" she recalled.\n\nJack is the athlete of the Ramsay family. According to People, he has played rugby and water polo, and he's studied jiu-jitsu.\n\nIn 2020, Jack joined the Royal Marines. Ramsay publicized his son's accomplishment in an Instagram post at the time.\n\n\"Can't tell you enough how proud I am of this young man Jack Ramsay you've made me feel like the proudest father today congrats on joining @royalmarines what amazing achievement,\" he wrote.\n\nA year prior, Ramsay celebrated his son finishing the famous Ironman Triathlon.\n\n\"Jack Ramsay you are an IronMan 19yrs old what took you so long! Congrats on an amazing achievement,\" the proud dad wrote on Instagram.\n\nIn 2015, Matilda, also known as Tilly, began starring in \"Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch,\" a children's cooking show on the BBC. Tilly later created a corresponding book, \"Matilda & The Ramsay Bunch: Tilly's Kitchen Takeover.\"\n\nBeyond her cooking show, Tilly has made her fair share of TV appearances, including as a contestant on \"Strictly Come Dancing\" and Australia's \"MasterChef.\" In 2024, she graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Nottingham.\n\nTilly frequently shares cooking videos on her TikTok, where she has nearly 10 million followers. She also hosted her own cooking show, \"Dish It Out,\" which premiered on Amazon in 2025.\n\nTana has spoken publicly about the pregnancy loss she experienced in 2016, and she encouraged people to discuss the often taboo topic of miscarriage.\n\n\"I found it really hard when people would talk to me and not mention it because it was like it never happened,\" she told Metro in 2020.\n\nIn an October 2021 Instagram post, Tana wrote about her family's experience.\n\n\"If all had gone as we hoped yesterday 14/10/21 would have been our little boy Rocky's 5th birthday, the day he was due not the day he was actually born when he was too little to survive,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Not a day goes by when we don't think of him,\" she continued, \"but, it wasn't meant to be.\"\n\nSpeaking on her husband's role during the hardship, Tana told Metro, \"Gordon was amazing, and he's always been one to talk about everything, and he was very good at sort of talking it out of me and never making me feel that, 'Oh, you know, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.'\"\n\nIn June 2023, she thanked her entire family in an Instagram post for their support throughout the hardship. \"I couldn't do this without my family, you are all everything to me,\" she wrote.\n\nIn 2018, when they were 18, Holly and Jack ran the London Marathon to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital and in memory of Rocky, Hello! reported.\n\nOscar James Ramsay was born in April 2019. In 2023, Tana shared photos of her son on Instagram for his 4th birthday, writing, \"4 already — wow where has that gone!! 4 years of loving you you crazy clever little boy - love you endlessly.\"\n\nHis sisters, Tilly and Holly, manage the toddler's Instagram account.\n\nA post shared by Oscar Ramsay (@oscarjramsay)\n\nRamsay once told Jimmy Fallon during a January 2021 interview that Oscar was his \"last hope\" of getting any of his children into the cooking industry.\n\nRamsay announced the birth via Instagram on November 11, 2023, by sharing a post showing his wife in the delivery room with their newborn son, Jesse James Ramsay.\n\nIn the caption, Ramsay confirmed that Jesse James would be their last child, writing: \"3 boys, 3 girls.... Done.\"\n\nRamsay had told the Daily Mail in 2021 that he and Tana were contemplating having one more child.\n\n\"I said it was a great idea. She said: 'Well, let's start planning.' So I'm like: 'Oh my god, just pause for two seconds. I'm going to be the oldest dad at school, what's going to happen on sports day?'\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"But it's something we'd still consider, because it's been such a joy spending time with Oscar,\" he added.",

    "description": "The new Netflix doc \"Being Gordon Ramsay\" offers a glimpse into the life of the iconic chef and TV personality and his most ambitious project.",
    "fullText": "The iconic chef might have been known by a completely different moniker — one that, it seems, he would have preferred.\n\n\"Scott's a lot better than fucking Gordon,\" Ramsay quips to his wife Tana.\n\nRamsay elaborated in a recent interview with BBC Radio 2, revealing he was named Gordon after his father.\n\n\"They christened me and mum said, 'We're going to name you after your father,'\" Ramsay said, noting that doctors originally believed he wasn't going to live for longer than two hours.\n\n\"Scott's a cool name,\" he added. \"I would've preferred to be called Scott.\"\n\nRamsay said his father believed that cooking wasn't a job for real men. He never ate at one of his son's restaurants before he died at the age of 53 from a heart attack.\n\n\"Deep down inside, I would love for my dad to have tasted something and even said, 'Yeah, good job,''' Ramsay said. \"I would've loved him to have understood, even though he didn't back what I was doing or believed in where it was going. You want validation from your parents.\"\n\nBoth Ramsay and Tana were in relationships when they first met while attending a mutual friend's wedding.\n\n\"I was looking at my mate thinking, 'Oh my god, your girlfriend is fucking gorgeous,'\" Ramsay recalled. \"She looked like a young Julia Roberts.\"\n\nTana, who was 18 when she met Ramsay, said it wasn't love at first sight with her future husband.\n\n\"I thought he was really arrogant, really full of himself; he used to really irritate me,\" she said. \"It took about a month, and then we were both single.\"\n\n\"I honestly thought for many months that Tana was out of my league,\" Ramsay added. \"I won her over with food.\"\n\nRamsay said he was \"transformed\" by the legendary chef, who became the first Brit to ever win three Michelin stars.\n\n\"He was like a father figure,\" Ramsay said. \"He had the gift of this Picasso; he put food on the plate like no other.\"\n\nRamsay said he was White's \"right-hand man\" at The Restaurant Marco Pierre White, working 18-hour days six days a week during his early 20s.\n\n\"I became very good very quickly,\" Ramsay added. \"He brought the natural talent out of me.\"\n\nRamsay said that The Restaurant Gordon Ramsay \"started with nothing.\" Since he couldn't buy expensive cuts of meat, he sold oxtail instead.\n\n\"But I still won two Michelin stars with oxtail,\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"When you get that third star, everyone says it's a sigh of relief, but it's not a sigh of relief,\" Ramsay said. \"It's fucking magical.\"\n\nThe Restaurant Gordon Ramsay remains open today and still has three Michelin stars to its name. During the docuseries, Ramsay hit back at critics who claim he cares more about being a \"TV chef\" than his actual restaurants.\n\n\"I didn't sacrifice the restaurants for TV, and I haven't used the TV to fake what's going on in the restaurants,\" he said. \"They go hand in glove.\"\n\nWhen Ramsay hosted a preview event for Bishopsgate, he opted to invite influencers to see the space instead of food critics.\n\n\"Ten years ago, we were depending on their pens,\" he said about critics. \"Ten years ago, we were depending on their insults. Ten years ago, we were depending on their egos, and they destroyed restaurants.\"\n\nRamsay noted how critics would often get personal throughout his career. He recalled one writer who called him a \"failed footballer that had a shotgun wedding.\"\n\n\"How does that relate to food?\" Ramsay asked. \"How do you write about a restaurant experience with that headline?\"\n\nNow, Ramsay believes that influencers are \"the most powerful critics on the planet.\"\n\n\"Being Gordon Ramsay\" also briefly follows Tilly's journey as she attends the Ballymaloe Cookery School in Ireland.\n\nTilly said she began cooking when she was very young, wanting to be \"part of everything\" that her father did.\n\n\"Cooking is definitely something that has brought us together,\" she said.\n\nDuring the docuseries, Ramsay goes with Tilly for the fitting of her first chef whites and visits her at the cooking school. Tilly hopes to someday open her own restaurant, just like her father.\n\nRamsay believes he could have \"been there a bit more\" for his four oldest children, who are now all in their 20s. So he's planning to do things a bit differently for his 6-year-old son Oscar and 2-year-old son Jesse James.\n\n\"I'll make more time for them because I never want them to say, 'You weren't there my first day at school. You missed my play. You missed my football match,'\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"But I'm shit at Nativity plays, I'm shit at Christmas carols, I'm shit at sports days because I want to compete and beat all the dads,\" he added. \"So maybe it's a good thing I didn't do all those.\"\n\n22 Bishopsgate will feature the restaurants Lucky Cat, Lucky Cat Terrace, Bread Street Kitchen, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay High, and the culinary school Gordon Ramsay Academy.\n\nLucky Cat is a 250-seat Asian-inspired restaurant, while Lucky Cat Terrace has 60 seats in a rooftop garden with a retractable roof. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay High is a 12-seat fine-dining restaurant, and Bread Street Kitchen will be an all-day brasserie.\n\nRamsay said he wants to make sure 22 Bishopsgate has \"some of the best restaurants in the world.\"\n\n\"It's sort of one of my final stakes in the ground, something I'm going to be best remembered for,\" he added.\n\nRamsay, who has a 20-year lease on the building, called it one of the \"most fraught projects I've ever done.\"\n\n\"The pressure with this project is that if it doesn't go to plan, it's my neck on the line, and I have to guarantee that every penny that we're borrowing, if it doesn't work, I have to pay that back personally,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to create something incredibly special to keep alive for 20 years, without a doubt.\"",

    "fullText": "Netflix isn't amused by ByteDance's new AI video tool.\n\nThe streaming giant sent a cease-and-desist letter to the China-based TikTok parent on Tuesday night, calling its new generative AI model Seedance 2.0 \"a high-speed piracy engine.\"\n\nSeedance turned heads last week after a user created a viral video of people resembling Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting on a rooftop about disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhile some were impressed, others panicked, with Deadpool cowriter Rhett Reese writing: \"I hate to say it. It's likely over for us.\"\n\nNetflix said in its letter to ByteDance that the company's AI video tool had also made videos mimicking characters from mega-hit Netflix shows like \"Stranger Things,\" \"Bridgerton,\" and \"Squid Game\" as well as the uber-popular movie \"KPop Demon Hunters.\"\n\n\"The use of copyrighted works to create a competing commercial product, especially one that regurgitates the original, is not protected by fair use,\" Netflix's litigation director wrote.\n\nNetflix urged ByteDance to stop generating AI videos that resemble its IP, and to identify and remove all such videos that have already been created. It also insisted that its IP be taken out of Seedance's training datasets.\n\nA ByteDance spokesperson said the company \"respects intellectual property rights\" and has \"heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.\"\n\n\"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,\" the ByteDance spokesperson said.\n\nDisney sent ByteDance a message similar to Netflix's last week. That's notable because Disney reached a deal in December to license iconic characters to OpenAI for its video-generating app Sora.\n\nSeedance is using \"a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art,\" Disney said in its cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance.\n\nNetflix echoed that sentiment, saying it would \"not stand by and watch ByteDance treat our valued IP as free, public domain clip art.\"\n\nParamount Skydance also sent a cease-and-desist letter last week to ByteDance expressing similar concerns, Variety reported.\n\nRead Netflix's letter to ByteDance below:",

    "description": "One of the world's richest men and his son get another shot at the media conglomerate, which includes Warner Bros., HBO and CNN.",
    "fullText": "Larry and David Ellison are getting another shot to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe media conglomerate announced Tuesday that it will let the Ellisons make another bid for the company over the next week, with two key stipulations: Their offer has to be more than $31 for each share of WBD, and it will be the last time the Ellisons get to make a formal pitch to the WBD board.\n\nWBD's announcement reopens a deal that was theoretically closed last December, when it agreed to sell most of itself to Netflix in an $83 billion transaction.\n\nSince then, the Ellisons, who bought Paramount last year and want to merge it with WBD, have argued that their offer of $30 per share — for the entire company — was better than Netflix's offer.\n\nThey have repeatedly told WBD and its investors that they should get another shot at making their case. Their most recent pitch came a week ago, when they offered to pay billions \n\nNow, WBD says, they have one more opportunity to bid. WBD says they expect the Ellisons to increase their offer to more than $31 a share. The company is trading around $28 a share, up 170% in the last year.\n\nIn a press release, WBD officials say that last week, a \"senior representative\" for Paramount told them that if they had the chance to bid, they would offer $31 per share, but could go above that.\n\nNone of this means the existing deal Netflix has with WBD goes away. For starters, WBD continues to formally endorse its Netflix deal. More important: If Paramount does increase its bid, Netflix will have the ability to raise its offer, too.\n\nAnd no matter what bid WBD eventually agrees to, the deal will still need regulatory approval in the US and overseas. Netflix got a preview of some of the issues regulators might bring up earlier this month during a congressional hearing, when Republicans argued that the company is too woke, and Democrats worried that a combined Netflix/WBD could doom the movie industry.\n\nA Paramount/WBD combination would also get regulatory scrutiny, though the Ellisons are counting on their ties to the Trump White House to give them a leg up.",

    "description": "Netflix docuseries \"Reality Check: Inside America's Next Top Model\" explores the  show's controversies, including that infamous race-swapping photoshoot.",
    "fullText": "In a new documentary, Tyra Banks responds to criticism of \"America's Next Top Model\" with a familiar refrain: \"Hindsight is 20/20.\" But for her former costar, Jay Manuel, one controversial moment was troubling from the start.\n\nNetflix's three-part documentary \"Reality Check: Inside America's Next Top Model\" explores the TV show's legacy, from its peak popularity in the early aughts to the divisive reactions from current viewers.\n\nPerhaps the most infamous photo shoot in \"Top Model\" history aired in 2005, when the season four contestants were told by Manuel, \"We're actually going to switch your ethnicities.\"\n\nSeveral of the models' faces and bodies were painted with dark makeup: Christina Murphy, Brittany Brower, and Noelle Staggers were assigned the roles of \"East Indian,\" \"African American,\" and \"traditionally African woman,\" respectively.\n\n\"The challenge here really is taking on the persona of that other ethnicity while in the photograph, and owning it,\" Manuel tells the models in the episode.\n\nMany viewers and critics have since condemned the photo shoot as blackface, an offensive practice that dates back to racist minstrel shows in the 1830s.\n\nIn the documentary, Manuel says he was uncomfortable with the concept from the start, especially given his family's history with racial segregation.\n\n\"The shoot that I had the most difficult time with was this race-swapping shoot. My parents are from South Africa. They grew up during apartheid. I am very aware of that history,\" he tells the camera. However, he says his objections were brushed off by Banks.\n\n\"I first asked to be excused from the photo shoot,\" Manuel continues. \"And Tyra said to me, 'I will handle this on camera with the girls at judging, just go and do your job.' I recognized that my role was starting to have limitations. That shoot was happening regardless.\"\n\nThe documentary includes clips from the episode, including several of Manuel, who was billed as the \"art director of photo shoots,\" coaching the models behind the camera.\n\n\"If you really look for it, you can see it on my face. Especially the setup for the day, where I tell the girls what we're doing. I could tell I was just, like, double swallowing,\" he recalls. \"But I just had to do my job.\"\n\nBanks, who created \"Top Model\" and hosted the reality show for 12 years, says she \"didn't think it was controversial\" at the time to paint the models' skin.\n\n\"I was in my own little bubble, in my own little head, that this was my way of showing the world that brown and Black is beautiful,\" she says in the documentary. \"But then we put it out there, and the world was like, 'Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?'\"\n\n\"Looking at the show now, through the 2020 lens, it's an issue, and I understand 100% why,\" Banks adds.\n\n\"Top Model\" became a surprise hit for UPN when it premiered in 2003. Banks worked with producer Ken Mok to develop a competition show that blended the performative elements of \"American Idol\" with the behind-the-scenes drama of \"The Real World.\"\n\nIt made for irresistible TV, and \"Top Model\" drew millions of viewers. However, Banks and Manuel both recall pressure to pump up the drama on \"Top Model\" as its audience continued to grow.\n\n\"It was a time in the world where there was a show, 'Fear Factor,' and 'Survivor,' and all of these things of, like, pushing the limits and all of that,\" Banks says. \"And so we kept pushing, and we kept creating more and more and more. You guys were demanding it.\"\n\nDawn Ostroff, then-president of UPN, says there was a constant push to raise the stakes, even as contestants were having emotional breakdowns or health emergencies on camera. Season three contestant Rebecca Epley fainted in the middle of judging, for example, and season seven winner CariDee English developed hypothermia during a photo shoot in a swimming pool.\n\n\"How do you get that, 'I can't believe they're doing that' moment again? You have to keep one-upping yourself,\" she says in the documentary. \"I never thought about, you know, 'Can we air it? Can't we air it?' Good television is good television.\"\n\nAlthough Manuel was originally cast as a creative director and occasional judge, he says the content of the challenges and photo shoots was largely out of his control, especially as the show got bigger. Eventually, his role was narrowed to \"on-camera talent.\"\n\n\"There was a time when the creative of the show started to shift. We were supposed to be showing the behind-the-scenes of what the fashion world was, helping change the industry. But the show had evolved in a way I'd never expected,\" Manuel says. \"I really struggled over some of the things that happened. And that was something that was slowly depleting me, chipping away at my soul.\"\n\nHe adds, \"Tyra would always reinforce, 'We need to keep it entertaining. We need to keep people watching.'\"\n\nIn \"Top Model\" season 13, which aired on The CW in 2009, the models were tasked with yet another race-swapping shoot. This time, Banks was the photographer.\n\nRepresentatives for Ostroff and Banks did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Netflix, Disney, and Paramount are turning to short-form video as YouTube and TikTok take viewership time. But these quick clips aren't a cure-all.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood giants are betting that snack-sized vertical videos can lure back audiences entranced by TikTok clips and YouTube Shorts.\n\nThe world has become hooked on short-form video. Reels on Instagram and Facebook are generating revenue at an annual rate of $50 billion, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in October, while Google reiterated last week that YouTube Shorts are viewed over 200 billion times per day.\n\nShort-form vertical videos are perfectly designed for phones, which most people carry 24/7, and for our increasingly short attention spans. As the streaming wars evolve, paid services see the phone as the next battleground they have to win.\n\n\"When it comes to engagement, sheer hours are no longer enough — you need frequency,\" Hernan Lopez, the founder of media research firm Owl & Co, told Business Insider. \"To get frequency, you need mobile, and to win in mobile, you need vertical.\"\n\nStreaming executives have taken note. Paramount has made short-form video a product priority and wants to add a million short-form clips to Paramount+ \"as quickly as possible,\" according to one exec, as Business Insider previously reported. Netflix and Peacock have also invested in short-form clips, while Disney has added vertical video to its revamped ESPN app and said it plans to do the same for Disney+.\n\n\"Short-form content is harder to monetize, especially from an advertiser perspective, but easier for young consumers to swallow,\" said Brandon Katz, the insights director at entertainment data firm Greenlight Analytics. \"Not even attempting to engage with it isn't an option.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Disney, Netflix, and NBCUniversal referred Business Insider to previous announcements and comments by executives about their short-form video initiatives. A Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nStreamers are scrambling for ways to narrow the gap with YouTube, whose viewership share on US TVs has more than doubled since May 2021, according to Nielsen. Higher engagement boosts advertising revenue and can help prevent cancellations.\n\nMedia analysts say vertical video can help streamers build habits and keep users engaged throughout the day, instead of just when they're lounging on their couches at night.\n\nEmily Horgan, a media consultant focused on kids shows, said that \"premium streaming is plowing into this space because of a need to own more lean-back moments in a viewer's day.\"\n\nStreaming executives are also looking for cheap content that can eat up viewing hours in a world where premium scripted shows are more expensive to produce. Video podcasts are one growth area that streamers like Netflix are gravitating toward, and short-form video is another.\n\n\"User-generated content and short-form programming is more cost-effective than trying to hit on the next 'Stranger Things' and 'Mandalorian,'\" Katz said.\n\nStreamers can also use their premium shows and movies to create short-form video. Paramount plans to dabble in short-form video by first repurposing existing content on its platform, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHowever, those internal documents also revealed that Paramount is brainstorming ways to potentially add user-generated content, which is the backbone of Instagram and TikTok.\n\nShort-form efforts among streamers have ramped up recently, but there have been false starts.\n\nNetflix was the first major streamer to try short-form when it debuted a \"Fast Laughs\" feature in 2021 that brought brief vertical clips of comedies and shows to its mobile app, and later to the TV. However, the feed never took off and was retired two years after its launch.\n\nAlthough Netflix's first foray into short-form video didn't charm audiences, it's not giving up yet. The streaming giant has been testing a vertical video feature since May to see what content and layout audiences prefer, a Netflix spokesperson said.\n\nDisney is trying to boost streaming engagement by bringing vertical video to Disney+ this year, including \"a curated slate\" of AI-generated videos made by OpenAI's Sora, executives said on an earnings call in early February.\n\nAnd Peacock has added short vertical videos from shows and the NBA games it broadcasts, a feature it first unveiled in early 2025.\n\nOne problem: It isn't yet clear that people want to binge short-form video on premium streamers instead of TikTok.\n\n\"Part of what makes YouTube and TikTok special with this format is the interactivity with comments, and the fact that the content is made by actual people,\" said Kasey Moore, who runs the What's on Netflix fan site that tracks Netflix releases.\n\nStill, there could be some value in short form.\n\n\"The goal wouldn't be to suck up time quite like TikTok to then serve ads in between,\" Moore said of Netflix. \"But rather, to leverage that specific format of video to provide tasters in the hopes of getting people to give engagement to the actual shows and movies that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.\"",

    "fullText": "For some, spooky season begins sometime in late August, when Home Depot puts out the animatronic skeletons and ghost projectors, and when every vacant retail space is possessed by a Spirit Halloween. For others, it's a no go until after Labor Day. Still other gorehounds believe there's no better time for a heart-rending scares than Valentine's Day.\n\nWhatever timing you prefer, there's a horror flick worth catching on Netflix—or 25 of them.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the earlier 28 movies, I didn't expect to care much about a legacy sequel. Danny Boyle, Alex Garland, and co. have still got it, though, grounding this visceral, sweaty, post-COVID installment in the story of Alfie Williams' Spike, a young boy coming of age amid the apocalypse alongside a distant dad and a dying mom—and then Ralph Fiennes comes along to steal the movie with his bone temple (not a euphemism).\n\nThere’s life in the found-footage genre yet, as proven by this fun and inventive horror comedy that cleverly calls back to the original Evil Dead with its blend of goofy good humor and wonderfully gross practical effects. Director/star Joseph Winter plays Shawn, a once-popular YouTube personality working on a comeback (one of the movie’s most clever conceits is in tricking you into liking a character who does not deserve your love). Popular for his outrageous stunts, he builds an all-night livestream around locking himself in a purportedly haunted house. You can certainly see where this is going, but Winter and company deftly blend solid scares, technical wizardry, and a few laughs to create a movie that’s loaded with scares and still manages to get in some good digs at our toxic social media landscape.\n\nDirector Josh Ruben is on a roll, from clever two-hander Scare Me, to the surprisingly effective video game adaptation Werewolves Within, to Heart Eyes, a clever slasher that’s also a very solid rom-com. Olivia Holt plays Ally, a pitch designer for a jewelry company who doesn’t quite understand why her “doomed couples” commercial is seen as offensive. Love, she’s pretty sure, is dumb, so the Heart Eyes Killer running around murdering lovers doesn’t quite register—she’s not dumb enough for romance. At least until consultant Jay (Scream’s Mason Gooding) shows up, their will-they-won’t-they chemistry putting them firmly in the sights of the killer.\n\nA horror comedy that serves both genres pretty darn well, Tim Story's modern slasher updates that horror trope wherein the Black character dies first. Here, everyone is Black, so who's the killer going to go for? A group of friends show up at a cabin in the woods to celebrate Juneteenth, only to discover their hosts are nowhere to be found, and that they're being targeted by a masked killer who wants them to play a Scream-esque game of Black culture trivia, with deadly stakes. Satire aside, the threats are intense and the would-be survivors (played by Grace Byers, Jermaine Fowler, Melvin Gregg, Sinqua Walls, Jay Pharoah, and Yvonne Orji) are better developed (and funnier) than in many a slasher, in tht you might actually care who lives and who dies.\n\nBefore Parasite, Yeon Sang-ho’s film was, perhaps, the biggest South Korean film to break into the American market, even if some of the subtext gets lost stateside (Busan was a haven for refugees during the Korean War). The 2016 film follows Seok-woo, a workaholic divorced dad who comes to feel that he’s running out of time to be the father he ought to be for his daughter Su-an. He has no idea how right he is. The train trip he plans for them as bonding time becomes something much more desperate when a zombie-infected woman hops aboard just before departure. What follows is one of the best action-horror movies of the past decade, but also a surprisingly moving story about a father and daughter reconnecting at the end of the world, as well as one that doesn't shy away from some pretty pointed critiques of modern capitalism. You can stream Train to Busan here.\n\nI think we're supposed to call this a gothic drama—its cast is too A-list, and it's been written and directed by perennial Oscar-fave Guillermo del Toro, so it must be more than mere horror. And yet! This unusually faithful version of Mary Shelley's classic novel finds the humanity in the monster, but there's plenty of existential horror on offer, aplus some of the gnarly, stomach-churningly grisly special effects sequences in recent memory It's up for nine Academy Awards, which doesn't mean that it isn't disturbing.\n\nThe spectre of the fascist rule of Augusto Pinochet continues to loom large in Chile, despite his having died a couple of decades ago. This is hardly unusual in the history of dictatorships—there are always those who remember the horrors, and those who made out OK and wonder if things weren't better back in the bad ol' days. This dark comedy/horror from Pablo Larraín (Spencer) turns that psychological omnipresence literal: Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) is a 250-year-old vampire who faked his own death, continuing his bloodsucking habits on a less public stage, while a determined nun seeks to exorcise him for good. There are bloody bits, and also some wild, but well-deserved swings at other dictatorial world leaders you might have heard of. With a nod to the original Nosferatu, the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography earned an Academy Award nomination.\n\nGerman widow Nadja is taking a flight to New York with her kid, Elias. She seems sick—we and her fellow passengers are meant to think that she has cancer, which makes her an easy mark for the terrorist hijackers who board the plane and shoot her out of pique. Big mistake. The vampires-on-a-plane high concept at work could have been silly, but at no point does the movie forget that we're seated for gory bloodsucking action.\n\nSo, Nightbooks is technically for kids, and therefore might not provide quite the volume of scares that a grown-up horror audience might be hoping for. That being said: There are some legit frights here, frankly a little beyond what you’d expect from a kids’ movie. It’s the old story of kids kidnapped by a witch (Krysten Ritter), with the added twist that one of the kidnapped, Alex (Winslow Fegley) writes scary stories, and has to tell one each night that he’s trapped in the witch’s apartment in order to stay alive. There’s imagery here to creep out just about anybody.\n\nTaiwan's biggest-grossing horror movie of all time inspired a TikTok challenge a couple years ago, asking viewers whether they could watch the whole thing without looking away. Possibly a little overly dramatic, but Incantation is certainly an intense found-footage horror film that draws us in by asking us, as viewers, to chant along with characters to help save a cursed child. Six years before the film's start, pregnant Ronan and her boyfriend interrupt a rural ritual while attempting to document it for their YouTube channel, and their lives have been very messed up ever since.\n\nIf you’re familiar with the wild tower action spectacle The Raid, you might have some sense of the energy that director Gareth Evans brings to Apostle’s second half, even if the styles are very different. This one’s pure folk horror, with nods to The Wicker Man: Dan Stevens (Downton Abbey, The Guest) plays Thomas Richardson, a now-faithless missionary who returns home to discover that his sister has been kidnapped by a religious cult on a remote Welsh island. What starts out feeling a bit like a sleepy period drama evolves into a truly wild gorefest before it’s done. You can stream Apostle here.\n\nAs fraught (and snooty) as the term “elevated horror” has become, it’s good to remember that a movie can have deep emotional resonance and a social conscience, all without sacrificing the haunted-house chills. Here, Bol and Rial (Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku), with their daughter Nyagak, flee war-torn Sudan to find refuge in a quiet English town, only to find that there’s evil waiting there for them.\n\nIf the neighbors refer to your house as the \"house of voices,\" I genuinely hope that you find that out before signing the papers—which obviously did not happen here. House flippers Daniel and Sara movie into a new place with their 9-year-old kid, Eric, who very quickly starts hearing voices coming from pretty much everywhere. The family hires an EVP (electronic voice phenomenon) expert to help, with very mixed results. This Spanish import works as a haunted house movie, but it's far more brutal than the usual, with a strong visual flair to top things off. You can stream Don't Listen here.\n\nGerald’s Game, from the 1992 Stephen King novel, never seemed terribly filmable. The story is set entirely in an isolated cabin in the woods, and involves a single immobilized character for much of its page count. Enter director Mike Flanagan—who, in addition to his successful miniseries projects (The Haunting of Hill House, Midnight Mass, The Midnight Club), did the impossible in crafting a killer adaptation of King’s lesser-loved Shining sequel, Doctor Sleep. Carla Gugino stars as a married woman trapped when her husband, played by Bruce Greenwood, dies after having handcuffed her to the bed. Increasingly delirious, she’s forced to face not only her past trauma, but the hungry dog that keeps sniffing around.\n\nOne of the better (maybe one of the best) found footage-style films of recent years, Creep takes place within the camera of Aaron (Patrick Brice, who also directed) and stars Mark Duplass (The Morning Show) as a dying man who hires the videographer to document his final days for his unborn son. The movie builds its tension around, initially, Aaron’s excessive friendliness—there are few better ways to create an atmosphere of unease than by offering up a character who’s a little too nice. Before long, the guy’s effusiveness curdles into an unpredictability that gets, well, creepier and creepier. You can stream Creep here.\n\nThe metaphor might seem a little heavy-handed—but modern life has begun to teach us that even the direst of dystopian sci-fi is just around the corner. The titular platform is a large tower, euphemistically referred to as the “Vertical Self-Management Center,” in which food is delivered via a shaft that stops on each floor from the top down: those near the top get to eat their fill; those at the bottom get scraps. The Spanish-language thriller is wildly violent, but inventive, and it’s not as if real-life capitalism is particularly subtle in its deprivations. You can stream The Platform here.\n\nIn Tehran during the Iran-Iraq War, a woman estranged from her husband is forced to protect her child from mysterious supernatural forces as the bombs continue to fall. Writer/director Babak Anvari’s Under the Shadow invokes the jinn (neither necessarily good nor evil, but potentially threatening) as a way to talk about the strife and turmoil of war and political conflict, as well as about the anxieties of women in oppressive societies. The atmospheric film plays simultaneously as the story of a haunting, and also as one about women and civilians in times of war; each element serves to heighten the other.\n\nI love a time-travel horror movie (a tiny but venerable genre that includes movies like Timecrimes, Triangle, and Happy Death Day). This one involves Seo-yeon (Park Shin-hye) visiting her childhood home in 2019, only to discover that an old cordless phone still works (never a good sign), and connects her to Young-sook (Jeon Jong-seo), living in the house in 1999. The two bond over shared experiences, but things soon go very wrong when Seo-Yeon tells the other young woman about the future, and influences her to make changes. Some events, it seems, are best left alone. Clever and disturbing, with a solid high concept.\n\nStrange doings are afoot on the title's Block Island, the most obvious being the vast numbers of dead fish that keep washing ashore. Almost as alarming, though, is the behavior of one of the local fishermen, Tom, who keeps waking up in strange places and generally losing time. His daughter Audry (Michaela McManus) works for the Environmental Protection Agency and is sent to investigate the mass fish deaths; she brings along her daughter and reunites with brother Tom (Chris Sheffield) along the way. Together, they discover that no ordinary environmental catastrophe is to blame (I guess it wouldn't be much of a horror movie if it were), as the film blends family drama and the eerie local events as it builds to a pretty chilling climax. You can stream Block Island Sound here.\n\nWith the always-welcome Martin Freeman in the lead, this is, OK, yet another zombie film, but one that still manages to do things a bit differently. An Australian import, this one tweaks the rules so that the infected have just about 48 hours of humanity before they turn, meaning that everyone has a bit of time to contemplate their fates, and maybe even to think about how to make the best use of their time. It’s a more melancholic take on the zombie apocalypse, full of chilling outback atmosphere and some genuine scares. Don't get confused with the 2020 sci-fi movie of the same name, also on Netflix. You can stream Cargo here.\n\nLoosely based on purportedly true events, this import from Spain is all spooky atmosphere and old-school chills. It's the story of a young woman who conjures up evil demons following some ill-conceived Ouija-play. (Seriously: Stop messing with those things). When some friends try to conjure up lost loved ones during a solar eclipse, they wind up making contact with a spirit they weren't expecting. Because of course they do. It's not the most original chiller, but the creepy fundamentals are sound, and there are plenty of solid scares. The sequel, Sister Death, is also streaming on Netflix. You can stream Verónica here.\n\nWhat do you do when one of your best friends is murdered in a botched liquor store robbery? Go to Sweden and tromp around in the woods, obviously! The four friends here do just that in this effective film that blends don’t-get-lost-in-the-woods horror with some genuinely mythological frights that play to the best traditions of folk horror.\n\nIndonesia has been a particularly fertile ground for the development of horror movies for a long time, and Netflix has hosted a few recent bangers. This one’s a pretty straight-up story of demonic possession and being very careful what you wish for, involving a man who sells his soul for wealth and success, only to release a demonic presence that brings goopy, gory harm to his loved ones. It might not be the most visually explicit in terms of its body horror, but it’s up there. The 2020 sequel, May the Devil Take You Too, is almost as good.\n\nI'm covering three movies at once here, as each film in the trilogy, adapted from the R. L. Stine books, shares a tone, quality, and director (Leigh Janiak, best known for Honeymoon prior to Fear Street). Fear Street Part One: 1994 kicks off the films by introducing the town of Shadyside, which the local kids call “Shittyside,” and has a dark history of multiple murders, most of them covered up. A group of teens upsets the grave of a witch, kicking off the revival of a murderous cult. The vibe here is a little bit Stranger Things, with some legit gore and scares (it’s YA, but definitely not kids’ stuff) as Janiak pays homage to a wide range of horror movies past. The series continues with a camp slasher homage in Fear Street Part Two: 1978, and then an origin that brings things to a conclusion in Fear Street Part Three: 1666. There's a standalone fourth film in the series, Prom Queen, which is fine...but this initial trilogy is something special.\n\nA short synopsis, involving Charlotte Willmore (Allison Williams) returning to her prestigious music academy after an absence and finding that another woman (Logan Browning) has taken her place at the head of the class, might make it seem as though we’re entering Black Swan territory, at worst—but the intentionally disjointed narrative here quickly careens into wildly claustrophobic body horror. It might not be the first film to mine dark thrills and gore out of arts education (Suspiria, anyone?) but it goes as far as any of them, and even beyond. You can stream The Perfection here.",

    "fullText": "Real-life romance is complicated and sometimes exhausting. That can be true for characters in movies, too, but their problems are generally funnier than our own and, anyway, they’re not our problems. A good rom-com is comforting either because we know everything will work out fine, or because we know we won’t have to deal with the hilarious and/or poignant consequences of interacting with other humans.\n\nSadly, the golden ago of the rom-com has passed us by—and Netflix in particular has pulled back on its selection of older (meaning anything much older than a decade) movies in favor of more recent releases, which means you might have to dust off your DVDs if you're looking for a '90s classic to get you in the Valentine's Day mood. On the other hand, that also means there are probably a lot of newer rom-coms on the service that you haven't seen before, including a handful of original films you won't find anywhere else.\n\nAdapted from Emily Henry's popular 2021 novel, People We Meet on Vacation goes the When Harry Met Sally route, following a couple of college besties who nurse confused, complicated feelings about one another over a period of years—recounted in not-entirely-linear flashbacks. Emily Bader is Poppy, a travel writer who's bored and unfulfilled with her job (her job...taking exotic vacations? OK.), while Tom Blyth is her pal Alex, with whom she spends one week a year on vacation. As the movie opens, the two haven't spoken in a couple of years, but are both headed to a Barcelona wedding that will be make-or-break for their relationship.\n\nJennifer Kaytin Robinson (Do Revenge, I Know What You Did Last Summer) makes her directorial debut with this charming rom-com that's less about the boys than it is about the power of friendship to help us deal with relationship nonsense. Gina Rodriguez is Jenny, a music journalist who lands her dream job only to have her long-term boyfriend (LaKeith Stanfield) immediately dump her. Her bestie Erin (DeWanda Wise) is struggling to admit her feelings to her girlfriend, while Blair (Brittany Snow) knows that she needs to ditch her man, but can't bring herself to do it. The solution to all their problems? One last wild night out before Jenny leaves town for her new gig.\n\nNora Ephron's followup to Sleepless in Seattle doesn't have quite the classic cachet of that earlier film, but Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are every bit as delightful as they were in the earlier movie. Inspired by 1940's The Shop Around the Corner, the story finds Hanks' Joe Fox and Ryan's Kathleen Kelly maintaining a sweet, anonymous, and increasingly intimate online relationship without realizing that they know each other IRL, and don't much care for each other (probably because he's trying to put her charming neighborhood bookstore out of business). It's very cute, and also a fun trip back to a time when email and chatrooms were novelties.\n\nAn underrated triumph from the late Rob Reiner, this one is both a sweet romantic comedy and a genuinely smart movie about American politics. Michael Douglas plays Andrew Shepherd, the widowed president in the middle of a re-election campaign who develops feelings for tough environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening). Their romance simmers in the background while real world issues play out, as the script mines genuine comedy out of the complications of a U.S. president trying to conduct a giddy, but clandestine, relationship with a \"normal\" woman while also running the country. Martin Sheen and Michael J. Fox co-star; Aaron Sorkin wrote the script, something of a dry run for TV's The West Wing a few years later.\n\nThe title of this South Korean import isn't some kind of euphemism. In fact, it's a pretty direct description of the film (think Secretary, but sweeter). Jung Ji-woo (Seohyun) is great at her job at a public relations firm, but doesn't always get the respect she deserves from her male colleagues. Because of their similar names, she accidentally opens a package for new co-worker Jung Ji-hoo (Lee Jun-young) that contains a leather collar and a leash. Horrified, he claims it was intended for his dog, but she ain't buying it. Instead, she's intrigued, and as the two gradually build toward a contractual BDSM relationship, and her dominant role helps her find confidence in the workplace, and what starts off as something like a business relationship develops into something a bit more romantic.\n\nGina Rodriguez plays sportswriter Mack, who has spent years writing hook-up plays for her friends—elaborate schemes that have led her and the crew to any number of one-night stands. The tables are turned when she falls for a war correspondent (Tom Ellis) who only sees her as a hookup. Her best friend Adam (Damon Wayans Jr.) jumps in to help her land her man, and unexpected complications arise when he realizes that his own feelings for Mack aren't entirely platonic.\n\nThis \"Netflix Original\" from director Richard Linklater (Dazed and Confused, Boyhood) was actually acquired by the streamer after it made a splash at the Sundance Film Festival, no doubt in anticipation of leading man Glen Powell finally having his moment. And certainly he's got charisma to spare in this shaggy-dog rom-com/thriller in which he plays Gary Johnson, a college professor who moonlights as a participant in sting operations for the New Orleans police department, pretending to be a hit man to rope in would-be criminals. When he feels a spark with his latest mark, a woman (Adria Arjona) desperate to escape an abusive husband, things get complicated. It's a great premise, the leads have chemistry to spare, and it's altogether a great hang.\n\nSpeaking of Glen Powell, he co-headlines this 2023 throwback (an extremely loose adaptation of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing) with Euphoria's Sydney Sweeney that became a box office hit despite a savaging by critics. The pair play an investment banker and a college student, respectively, who meet cute but suffer a classic rom-com misunderstanding that leaves them both bitter—then, two years later, they meet up at the destination wedding of her sister and his roommate's sister, perfectly positioned for a classic enemies-to-lovers turnabout.\n\nJessica Williams plays the title's New York City playwright, who finds herself at loose ends following a bad breakup and a seemingly endless string of rejections for her work. She's introduced to divorced Boone (Chris O'Dowd), with whom she bonds over life's disappointments. The real charm in this smart indie are in its performances, as well as its conviction that romance needn't be an end unto itself, but can go hand in hand with a renewed sense of artistic purpose.\n\nBumped from theaters and sold to Netflix at the beginning of the pandemic, his two-hander starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani was largely overlooked at the time, but deserves a second chance. They play a couple whose relationship is at a low point after four years together. Through bizarre circumstances, the same night they decide to break up, they are the joint witnesses to a murder and must go on the run—and nothing reignites an old flame like life-or-death stakes. The film was directed by Michael Showalter, who helped put Nanjiani on the map with 2017's The Big Sick.\n\nThe first Spike Lee joint, this enormously charming low-budget feature follows Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns), a young artist living in Brooklyn in the pre-hipster 1980s, as she muses on her romantic relationships with three different men (one of them played by Lee himself). If a little rough around the edges, it's an extremely accomplished debut, hinting at Lee's future career with creative flourishes, from a documentary shooting style to sequences in which interviews with the characters (and a handful of real people) offer commentary on the difficulties of navigating romantic relationships in the then-modern era.\n\nVietnam is the real star in this, the first movie to be shot in the country following the COVID-19 pandemic. Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That) stars as a travel executive (dealing with a recent break-up, naturally) who sneaks off to Southeast Asia to go undercover on one of the group tours her company promotes. In the process she meets tour guide Sinh (Scott Ly), who encourages her to step outside of her comfort zone. Together, they explore some of the most beautiful features of modern Vietnam. Probably they fall in love too, IDK.\n\nViolet Jones (Sanaa Lathan) spends her life in near-terror of rain, for fear that her rigorously straightened hair will be ruined. That hair is a signifier in every aspect of her life, straightening sessions even having been a way to bond with her demanding mother (Lynn Whitfield). Following a breakup with her boyfriend because of her exacting nature (particularly regarding her hair), she experiments with: different colors that her friends object to; a natural style that renders her either invisible or the subject of derision; she even shaves her head at one point, which only gets her invited to a cancer support group. Director Haifaa al-Mansour’s movie makes a great point about the fraught nature of Black hair, particularly when that hair belongs to a woman. Meeting a salon owner in the middle of a freakout, Violet begins a slow journey to learning to love herself, her hair, and maybe even the hot salon owner (Lyriq Bent).\n\nRomantic comedies are often (not always) comfort food, and so we often find familiar plots: Here, longtime friends who’d lost touch (Ali Wong and Randall Park) reconnect after a falling out years before. She’s a successful celebrity chef and engaged; he’s fixing air conditioners with his dad, which is how the two meet up. Nahnatchka Khan (creator of Fresh Off the Boat) brings a light touch here, and Wong and Park have great chemistry; they’re joined by a fun supporting cast that includes a really funny turn from Keanu Reeves playing himself.\n\nSome of the best romantic comedies involve a slightly outlandish scheme, and this reliably charming Netflix original has one of those great setups: Two overworked assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) come up with the idea that, if they can get their bosses (Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs) laid, they’ll be less interested in stressing out their employees. So the two harried assistants plan to set their bosses up, which, not unexpectedly, goes very comedically awry in pretty much every way. Naturally these things never work out as planned, and the romance in the offing is not the one that anyone had expected.\n\nThough Numa Perrier’s film hits plenty of the traditional rom-com beats, lead Gabrielle Union provides the spark that ignites the whole film (based on the Tia Williams novel). She’s never been better than she is here, playing Jenna, a woman in her 40s making a clean break of a long-term relationship and taking on a high-profile, high-stakes career in beauty journalism—only to wind up in a one-night stand with Eric (Keith Powers), 15 years younger and the son of her boss.\n\nWriter/director Alice Wu made a splash with her queer classic Saving Face way back in 2004. Her long-awaited follow-up, a comedy-drama inspired by Cyrano de Bergerac, is better. Here, friendless high schooler Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis, from “Nancy Drew”) is tasked with writing love letters to her crush, Aster (Alexxis Lemire), on behalf of a football player named Paul. There’s plenty that’s familiar here, but Wu makes everything feel fresh and fun.\n\nOne of the most iconic and memorable rom-coms of the 1990s might be new to many American viewers, who are missing out on a movie that’s both wonderfully goofy and deeply poignant in the best tradition of the genre. Shah Rukh Khan plays Rahul Khanna, best friends in college with Anjali (Kajol), but smitten with Tina (Rani Mukerji). Rahul and Tina get married and time goes by, but Tina always feels a little bit guilty, like maybe she got in the way of something. With little time left to live following complications in childbirth (did I mention there’s also drama here?), Tina writes her daughter a series of letters—the last one asking that she make sure that dad and Anjali reconnect.\n\nIndian director Ritesh Batra (The Sense of an Ending and The Lunchbox) brought together screen legends Robert Redford and Jane Fonda for this well-received romantic drama from a top-rate director. Despite the ominous title, it’s a quiet and sweet film that’s worthy of its stars. It’s not really a comedy, so I’m cheating a bit by putting it here, but it’s got such a satisfyingly light touch that it hits most of the same buttons as more straightforward rom-coms.\n\nHigh schooler Alex Truelove (Daniel Doheny) is psyching himself up to have sex with his girlfriend, Claire, for the first time—but something’s holding him back. Openly gay Elliott (Antonio Marziale) has an idea why Alex is so reluctant and, frankly, the audience ought to have a clue by that point, as well. It’s a perfectly sweet, good-natured coming-of-age story that has some fun with Alex’s awkward efforts to set expectations aside and just kinda be himself.\n\nIf you want a rom-com to clean up at the Oscars, you're gonna need to put it in drag. Maybe throw in some Shakespeare. Hell, might as well make it about Shakespeare. A lot less heavy than 2026 Oscar contender Hamnet, this one finds Joseph Fiennes as the rakish title character to Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola de Lesseps, the daughter of a wealthy merchant who loves the theater so much that she's more than willing to dress up like a man to get to appear on stage. Their eventual infatuation will have to overcome the strictures of the era and earn the approval of Judi Dench's Queen Elizabeth.\n\nAsha (Pallavi Sharda) just broke off her engagement and left her Wall Street investment firm in favor of a Jersey City startup. Her concerned mother sets her daughter up on a dating app, and Asha acquiesces to a single date with the first match: Ravi (Suraj Sharma). It doesn’t go particularly well, but they’re both under a lot of parental pressure to get married, and Asha has about a dozen weddings to go to over the course of the summer, most of them filled with busybodies who want to see her in a relationship. So, naturally (for a movie), Ahsa and Ravi decide to play at being a couple to get people off their backs—which works out fine, until it doesn’t.\n\nClass-busting romance is nothing particularly new, but this candid Saudi Arabian comedy-drama sees middle-class civil servant Barakah (Hisham Fageeh) strike up a relationship with Bibi, a boundary-pushing Insta celebrity. Just finding time and space to pursue a frowned-upon relationship in modern Saudi is challenging, but the movie explores the social and political obstacles with a light touch.\n\nImagine that everyone you’d ever had a crush on received a letter expressing your exact feelings. It’s a nightmare scenario, but a reality for shy high school junior Lara Jean (Lana Condor), who’d written the letters as a form of secret diary, only to show up at school one day to find that her little sister had mailed them all. Can you imagine? Condor is fantastic here, and the whole thing is delightful. It’s been followed by two also-very-good sequels, as well as an ongoing spin-off series (XO, Kitty).\n\nWe start out in familiar territory here: Dineo and Noni (Fulu Mugovhani and Tumi Morake, both very funny) are a couple of successful big-city women—this time in Johannesburg. Dineo is on the hunt for a long-term relationship, even after getting dumped via livestream at work, while Noni is perfectly content with one-night stands. Their romantic (and un-romantic) trials are alternately charming, horrifying, and hilarious. The heart of the movie is its two leads, and the friendship that sustains them.",

    "fullText": "Dana White’s latest venture into boxing might be about to shake up the sport in a big way, with reports suggesting Zuffa Boxing is closing in on a fight fans have wanted for years.\n\nSo far, Zuffa Boxing has only put on two shows. But given White’s long track record of promoting major events in combat sports, there’s already plenty of buzz around what he could bring to boxing. That reputation now faces a real test, as talks are swirling around what could be one of the sport’s most anticipated matchups.\n\nAccording to BoxingScene, the matchup between Nate Diaz and Paulie Malignaggi has been verbally agreed, marking one of the more unexpected turns this year. The two have a history going back several years over comments Malignaggi made about Nate and Nick Diaz.\n\nTyson Fury and Anthony Joshua have been linked to a fight for years without ever sharing the ring. The closest they came was an early sparring session during their youth, long before their professional careers took off. That may be about to change, though.\n\nIt is being reported by BoxingScene that Dana White is planning to stage the fight on Zuffa Boxing, with Netflix likely to broadcast it. Reports suggest that Netflix will also be involved in Fury’s upcoming April fight against Arslanbek Makhmudov, adding to their growing presence in live sports.\n\nA car accident last year left Joshua injured and cost him two close friends. However, he has since returned to training and recently released a video addressing the loss of his friends and his journey back.\n\nFury hasn’t fought since back-to-back defeats against Oleksandr Usyk in Saudi Arabia. Joshua’s last appearance was a knockout win over Jake Paul on another Netflix card just days before his accident.\n\nDana White didn’t hold back his excitement after Zuffa Boxing 2, hinting that the promotion is ready to make some noise in the industry. Speaking at the post-fight press conference, he suggested big news is on the way.\n\n“We have some pretty crazy announcements coming over the next few weeks,” he said, without naming any specific dates or fighters. “I’m way further in this thing than I anticipated being two shows in.”\n\nWhite added: “There’s a lot going on to rock the industry – new signings, more deals, new territories. I’m telling you guys by the end of 2026, it’s going to be impressive.”\n\nWhite has plenty of experience in boxing promotion already. He was involved with Tom Loeffler’s work for Callum Walsh, including a Dublin event in 2024 and also promoted last year’s Canelo Alvarez vs Terence Crawford bout.",

    "description": "Scott Borchetta discusses his daily schedule, balancing meetings, artist management, daily exercise, and watching Netflix with his wife.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Borchetta, the 63-year-old CEO and chairman of Big Machine Label Group, based in Nashville. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started my career in the mailroom for my dad's promotion company and worked my way up after we moved from California to Nashville. I played bass in a country band at night, where I learned about the music industry. I used that knowledge to pursue jobs at record labels.\n\nMy first job in the industry was at MTM Records. I then spent two years working as an independent promoter before moving into promotion and artist development roles at MCA Nashville Records, DreamWorks Nashville, and Universal Music Nashville.\n\nIn 2005, I left Universal Music Nashville to start Big Machine Records. The record label I founded has grown over 20 years into the Big Machine Label Group.\n\nBMLG artists have included Taylor Swift, Rascal Flatts, Reba McEntire, Florida Georgia Line, Thomas Rhett, Brantley Gilbert, Ronnie Dunn, Sugarland, and Carly Pearce, among others.\n\nHere's what a typical day in my life looks like.\n\nThe first thing I do when I wake up is work out for 90 minutes. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the workout takes place at my house with a trainer. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, it's held at a physical therapy center.\n\nAfter my workout, I become a fireman by checking my phone and seeing what's happening in the business, because there's always something burning. I respond to urgent messages so that I can focus on the day's mission. When you have 35-plus artists, there's always a meeting, new music to be made, and the next TV show to schedule.\n\nI eat light in the morning; I like to let the workout burn. I'm more of a green tea person, as that doesn't have too much caffeine.\n\nI'm in the office every business day; I'm still old school about that. I appreciate the energy of people interacting, and face-to-face interactions still yield the best results and understanding of the mission.\n\nOn Monday, I have a publicity meeting, followed by an A&R meeting. In the afternoon, we have our three different country imprint promotion calls, because Monday is our ad day, so we find out which stations added which records.\n\nTuesday's our leadership day. Wednesday and Thursday have standing meetings. I leave Friday open. Anyone who wants to schedule with me has to go through my executive assistant.\n\nEven for business lunches, it's easier to have people come and bring food. That way, we won't waste 30 to 40 minutes going back and forth.\n\nI usually have a kale salad with salmon, or a sliced filet — definitely a protein-rich midday option. I'm not a huge eater, but those are my go-to options, and I eat sushi once a week.\n\nThe indulgence I allow myself most days is one eight-ounce can of Red Bull for a surge in the afternoon.\n\nI recently met with Mackenzie Carpenter about the new album she's preparing to record. The next day, I might have a Thomas Rhett strategy meeting.\n\nI have time in the afternoon to catch up on things and ensure we're moving forward. Every day is different. I try to leave a couple of hours in the afternoon to do the actual work, rather than nonstop back-to-back meetings.\n\nThe time I leave depends on what we have going on. The artists we have playing will dictate when I leave the office. The other night, I went to see Jackson Dean at the Opry at 9 p.m.\n\nIf I have an open night, it's a great opportunity for me to catch up and spend some quality time with my wife. My wife is a very good cook. Occasionally, we'll order out, so I always say, \"Oh, I cooked. Look, honey.\"\n\nMy wife and I enjoy binge-watching shows together at night. Friday night is party night; we'll have red wine, usually a Bordeaux or Cali Cab, and there's always chocolate hidden in a cupboard.\n\nOne of my favorite series from the last year or so was The Offering, which is a series on the making of The Godfather. We've just finished Acapulco.\n\nAfter watching a show with my wife, I'll typically go to bed late, wake up, and do it all over again.\n\nAn example of a week of travel is being in Vegas from Wednesday through Sunday morning. Wednesday night, we saw Mötley Crüe. On Thursday night, we attended a crazy show called Absinthe, a Cirque du Soleil production.\n\nFriday night featured Sammy Hagar, who was part of the iHeart Festival, and Saturday night was Tim McGraw, also part of the iHeart Festival. Many of the iHeart crew are dear friends and great business partners, so it's often very late nights.\n\nI work on the weekends if something needs to be done.\n\nFor my artists, especially, I always make time for them if they need anything. It doesn't derail my day when we have to rearrange some things. Even if something goes really wrong, I'm very good at compartmentalizing.\n\nJust because something went wrong with this artist or manager doesn't mean the next executive or the next artist will inherit that overflow — I try to put the right energy where it belongs.\n\nWhen I spend a lot of time having in-person conversations during the day and come back to see that I have 168 emails, I'm like, Ugh. Email is so ineffective in many ways, but it's a necessary evil. If I could do away with it, I would much rather be in person.\n\nA lot of these artists are my friends, and they walk in, and people are like, \"Oh my God, did you see that so-and-so was in the office today?\" I'm always listening to new music from our artists and potential new signings. Non Big Machine artists on the playlist jump from Yungblud to Ella Langley to Sombr.\n\nWhether it was Taylor Swift back in the day, or Reba McIntyre, or Dolly Parton, or Riley Green right now — I love working with artists who think big.\n\nI'm proud of our NASCAR team, Big Machine Racing, and I'm proud of Borchetta Bourbon, which is off to its best year ever. There are many fun things across all our brands, and I love what I do.",

    "description": "The hit Netflix romance series \"Bridgerton\" season 4 delivered more steamy scenes for fans, and we ranked which relationships reign supreme.",
    "fullText": "Season one of \"Bridgerton\" followed Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor), the fourth Bridgerton child, on her journey to find the love of her life. Before finding her husband, Daphne had to get past Nigel Berbrooke (Jamie Beamish), who was determined to marry her for her status despite being much older than her and despite her lack of interest.\n\nThis was one of the season's most uncomfortable pairings. Suffice to say, there was zero chemistry in this relationship, and it was a relief that it did not end in marriage.\n\nIn \"Queen Charlotte,\" young Lady Agatha Danbury (Arsema Thomas), who is a respected member of society in the main \"Bridgerton\" series, was trapped in a sexually abusive relationship with Lord Herman Danbury (Cyril Nri).\n\nHerman was much older than his wife, and it is implied that they married when she was a child. While this was more common in the 18th century, when \"Queen Charlotte\" is set, their relationship was still an incredibly uncomfortable watch.\n\nThe only reason they are not last is because Agatha did seem to care for Herman and defended and supported him throughout the show … but she also kind of hated him.\n\nThe Featherington family is another major family in London's high society, led by Lord Featherington (Ben Miller) and Lady Portia Featherington (Polly Walker) in \"Bridgerton\" season one. However, Lord Featherington was a reckless gambler who squandered the family fortune.\n\nThere seemed to have been love between them at some point, but time and secrets clearly broke down whatever they had and left them bitter.\n\nAn example of this is when Portia found out that her husband had died in the season one finale. Instead of grieving the loss or asking what happened, she rushed to discover if her money was missing.\n\nIn \"Bridgerton\" season two, Lady Portia Featherington schemed to pair her daughter Prudence (Bessie Carter) with her nephew Jack Featherington (Rupert Young), the new head of the family, so that she could keep control of their family home.\n\nLady Featherington succeeded in entrapping Jack in marriage, but he had little affection for his cousin Prudence. Although they sort of got along, their relationship was very awkward.\n\nBefore Jack Featherington was paired up with his cousin, he tried to woo Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen), the popular mean girl of London high society (also called the Ton).\n\nJack's charm made it seem as if they were compatible, but it was later revealed in season two, episode four, that Jack only cared about Cressida for her family's wealth.\n\nLord Debling (Sam Phillips) caught the eye of two rivals in season three, Cressida Cowper and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan).\n\nCressida saw Lord Debling as a means of escaping her unloving family, so she initially lied about liking nature to win him over. Eventually, they had one honest moment, bonding over their difficult relationship with their families.\n\nBut before anything could develop between them, Lord Debling disappeared after episode four.\n\nCressida is as close as this show gets to a villain, so we don't feel too great about either of her relationships.\n\nLord Ledger (Keir Charles) and Lady Vivian Ledger (Katie Brayben), the parents of fan-favorite character Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell), appeared in \"Queen Charlotte.\" We only got a few scenes together, but it was very clear they were not a match.\n\nThough they stick together in the miniseries, Lord Ledger openly criticized his wife and had an affair.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" season three surprised audiences by giving a central story to Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd), a character who was mostly forgotten in the first two seasons.\n\nIn season three, she made her debut and quickly became the Queen's favorite. However, Francesca struggled with the pressures of finding love, the social season, and the Queen's obsession with her love life.\n\nIn episode three, the Queen introduced Francesca to her friend, Lord Samadani (David Mumeni). Lord Samadani and Francesca were a polite pair, but there was no real connection between them. Lord Samadani loves his big family, while Francesca wants to escape hers.\n\nThus, it was no surprise that Francesca leapt at the first man she got along with to get away from Lord Samadani.\n\nIn \"Bridgerton\" season one, Marina Thompson (Ruby Barker), a distant cousin of the Featheringtons, came to stay with Lady Featherington and her daughters so she could find a husband. Marina was secretly pregnant, so Lady Featherington tried to marry her off before the scandal was revealed.\n\nAt the end of season one, Marina did find a husband, even after her secret pregnancy was exposed. In the season finale, Philip Crane (Chris Fulton), the brother of Marina's secret lover, George Crane, showed up to tell her that George had died while fighting in Spain.\n\nHowever, Philip offered to marry Marina in George's place, and she eventually accepted.\n\nIn episode four of season two, we got a glimpse of their relationship after marriage, and they seemed quite happy together. They didn't seem to share many interests or chemistry, but Philip ensured Marina and her twins were looked after.\n\nThey seem like a much more amicable pairing than most couples on this list, but it remains to be seen if their story in the show follows what happens in the book series.\n\nWe never see how Prudence Featherington and Harry Dankworth (James Phoon) meet, but they are a married couple in season three.\n\nHowever, it seemed that for most of the season, Prudence did not like Harry. She brushed him away at every turn, hated having sex with him, and was generally annoyed by his presence and lack of wealth. Meanwhile, Harry adored Prudence and often stated that he would do anything for her.\n\nIt is unclear what changed, but by the season three finale, Prudence seemed more affectionate toward Harry, and the two even had a child together. We may see their love grow in future seasons.\n\nLady Agatha Danbury had a third chance at love in \"Queen Charlotte\" when she met Queen Charlotte's brother, Duke Adolphus (Tunji Kasim).\n\nThe pair had some sweet, affectionate moments, but it's clear Agatha was still reeling too much from the pain of both of her previous relationships to commit to this new romance.\n\nBenedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson), the second-eldest Bridgerton sibling, only pursued casual flings in the first three seasons of the show.\n\nIn the second half of \"Bridgerton\" season two, Benedict had a casual relationship with Tessa (Emily Barber), a life model and budding artist at his art academy.\n\nWe didn't see much of them, but they seemed to be a good match, even though Benedict was not looking for anything serious.\n\nThough Thompson could muster sexual tension with a door, we don't see enough of this couple to place them higher.\n\nBenedict's first relationship in \"Bridgerton\" was with Madame Delacroix (Kathryn Drysdale), the town's dressmaker. In season one, episode five, Benedict met her at a party, and within moments, they started making out.\n\nThis was a fleeting relationship, but the attraction between the two was palpable.\n\nIn \"Bridgerton\" season one, Benedict befriended artist Henry Granville (Julian Ovenden) and his wife, Lucy Granville (Sandra Teles).\n\nWhile we didn't see a lot of Lucy and Henry, they seemed like a couple who loved each other very much, even if they were not in love with each other. In episode seven, Henry explained to Benedict that their marriage is for show.\n\nIn reality, Henry was in love with Lord Wetherby (Ned Porteous), and Lucy enjoyed the privileges of being married to the artist, including having affairs herself during a party in episode five.\n\nOverall, the couple seemed happy, supportive of each other, and mutually into ethical nonmonogamy.\n\nPrince Friedrich (Freddie Stroma), the nephew of Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel), was another suitor for Daphne in \"Bridgerton\" season one.\n\nThis pairing was amicable, and it's possible to imagine that if not for the existence of the Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page), they may have had a long, happy life with lots of children. The prince was a perfect gentleman and even willing to skirt convention by inviting Daphne to the boxing match in episode four.\n\nHowever, one thing this couple lacked was passion. In most of their interactions, Daphne was either looking for Simon or thinking about him, and thus, she would never be truly happy settling for the prince.\n\nIn \"Bridgerton\" season two, Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey), the eldest Bridgerton sibling, was on the hunt for a wife. He eventually picked Edwina Sharma, a new member of the Ton who became popular after the Queen gave her the greatest honor, naming her the \"Diamond of the Season.\"\n\nThe couple didn't have the best start in terms of chemistry. From day one, it was clear that Anthony Bridgerton saw his courtship of Edwina as a chore. While Edwina was infatuated with Anthony from the start, she did not like his competitive nature.\n\nAnthony finally saw Edwina as a person (what a concept!) in episode three when they bonded over reading.\n\nAfter that, there were a few conversations when it seemed they might share some interests or have chemistry, but that moment did not last long due to Anthony's love for Edwina's older sister, Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley).\n\nIn season three, Penelope Featherington, the youngest Featherington child, finally pursued her own romance instead of watching from the sidelines. This led her to Lord Debling, another man who was a social outcast because he was a vegetarian, which, sure, OK.\n\nThough Penelope and Debling had different interests, they had similar values, and both were willing to settle for a relationship that was more practical than loving. In episode three, they had great banter, and Lord Debling also risked his own life to save Penelope from a hot-air balloon.\n\nUnfortunately, Penelope's feelings never grew deeper because she had feelings for another. Lord Debling noticed and stepped out of her way.\n\nBefore Marina Thompson met Philip Crane, she spent a lot of season one trying to make Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), the third Bridgerton sibling, fall in love with her.\n\nOn the one hand, Marina spent most of season one trying to entrap Colin into marriage before she gave birth, which meant part of the relationship was based on a major lie. On the other hand, these two did look cute together and seemed to actually like each other.\n\nHowever, when Luke met a married Marina in episode four of season two, it became clear why their relationship would have never worked. He was still an immature boy masquerading as a man, and what Marina needed was a stable husband for her children.\n\nSeason three introduced Benedict Bridgerton's third lover, a widowed woman named Lady Tilley Arnold (Hannah New). They were a perfect pair since they were both looking for aimless, casual fun.\n\nLater in the season, Tilley expanded their relationship by adding her other friend with benefits, Paul Suarez (Lucas Aurelio).\n\nThere was a lot of sexual chemistry between this trio, and fans loved the fact that \"Bridgerton\" finally confirmed Benedict's bisexuality. But there isn't much non-physical chemistry between the throuple.\n\nAlso, Benedict seemed more interested in Paul than Tilley during their sex scenes in episodes seven and eight, but the men weren't given the opportunity for romance to develop.\n\nMeanwhile, Tilley's confession that she liked Benedict more than a friend in the season finale seemingly came out of nowhere since their relationship was always shown to be more playful than serious.\n\nAnd since neither of them is given a fleeting mention in season four, it's safe to assume they didn't really mean that much to Benedict.\n\nToward the end of \"Bridgerton\" season two, Jack Featherington set his sights on Lady Portia Featherington, and honestly, these two schemers were weirdly perfect for each other.\n\nTheir relationship may have been slightly toxic, linked together only by their mutual scheming in season two, but when they worked together, it was magic, and the actors played off each other well.\n\nHowever, their relationship was doomed because Portia will always love her daughters more than anyone else, and Jack never really cared for the Featherington siblings. When the moment arrived to make that choice, after the pair's investment scam was exposed in the season two finale, Portia threw Jack under the bus.\n\nOut of Lady Agatha Danbury's three relationships in \"Queen Charlotte,\" she had the best chemistry with Lord Ledger, aka Violet's dad.\n\nFrom the first encounter during Lady Danbury's ball in episode three, the pair got on splendidly, and Lord Ledger was clearly trying to flirt with Agatha. In episode five, their connection deepened as they went on walks (\"ramblings\") together after Lord Danbury's death, and the two eventually consummated their relationship.\n\nThis couple isn't placed higher in the ranking because of how abruptly their relationship ended when Lord Ledger broke off the affair, but when it was good, it was good.\n\nThe very first scene of \"Bridgerton\" is Anthony and Siena hooking up against a tree. Physical chemistry was never the problem with these two. Instead, Anthony found himself trapped between his duty to his family and his love for Siena.\n\nIn fact, Anthony was prepared to discard his family and duty for that love, but Siena rejected him. While the second season never explicitly said this, it's likely Anthony was adamant about finding a wife and fulfilling his familial duty — but not falling in love — because of Siena's choice.\n\nAnthony's feelings for Siena were also always entangled with his desire to escape his mounting responsibilities to his siblings. It's why he tried to rekindle his relationship with Siena in episode four when he believed he had to flee the country after his duel with the Duke of Hastings.\n\nAnthony cared a lot for Siena but didn't truly see her as an equal, so their breakup was inevitable.\n\nEloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie) met Theo Sharpe, who worked in Lady Whistledown's printer shop, on her hunt for the gossipmonger's identity in season two.\n\nWhile the pair first dueled with mocking jabs, they quickly formed a friendship over their shared interest in politics. Their relationship was not as sexual as the others on the list, but the flirting mockery worked because you could tell they weren't arguing just for the sake of arguing.\n\nThey were so cute that plenty of fans were ready to throw away Eloise's love interest from the books in favor of Theo.\n\nUnfortunately, their love was cut short by the Queen and Penelope's meddling.\n\nPhillipa Featherington (Harriet Cains), the final Featherington daughter, quickly found a lover in the first season after Albion Finch (Lorn Macdonald) courted her.\n\nIn season one, episode four, the odd pair bonded over cheese, and if that doesn't spell couple goals, we don't know what does. In the following seasons, they remained one of the most loving couples on the show, even though they were mostly in the background.\n\nFrom what we've seen in the first four seasons, this pair is one of the most perfect matches in the show. However, their lack of visibility makes it hard to gauge their chemistry against other couples.\n\nThroughout \"Bridgerton,\" Will (Martins Imhangbe) and Alice Mondrich (Emma Naomi) have been couple goals.\n\nThey're nothing more than a happy couple minding their business in a town where everyone is involved in a scandal or two.\n\nThis changed in season three when they became nobility and had their first proper conflict. Alice wanted to embrace their new role in the Ton, but Will was stubborn and still wanted to run the Gentleman's Club he had built up the previous season.\n\nIn the sixth episode of season three, Will spontaneously gave in and sold his club. While Will seemed supportive of his wife for the rest of the season, he was never truly happy about selling his club.\n\nSeason four, unfortunately, doesn't really address this. Instead, their plot this season is about Alice potentially becoming a lady-in-waiting for Queen Charlotte, which doesn't give Will much to do.\n\nThough \"Bridgerton\" season three was about Colin and Penelope, Francesca and John Stirling (Victor Alli) stole the hearts of many fans.\n\nIn episode three, Francesca tried to escape the chaos of the ball and stumbled upon John, the Earl of Kilmartin, standing alone in the back garden. The pair immediately clicked in the most unusual way, connecting over their quiet, calm energy. In fact, there were a few comical scenes when they flirt by saying nothing at all.\n\nThis pairing showed that chemistry is not only about sexual tension, grand displays of affection, or even steamy sex scenes. Chemistry can also be when a pair matches each other's vibe and emboldens one another to step outside their comfort zones.\n\nThe only reason Francesca and John are not higher on the list is that the events of the season three finale (and a few scenes in season four) show that these two might not actually have the most romantic chemistry, even if it's clear they care about one another.\n\nThey may be the blueprint, but that doesn't automatically give them the No. 1 spot. Simon Basset, the Duke, and Daphne Bridgerton had their chemistry tested multiple times, and it wasn't always smooth sailing.\n\nWhat sold it for us was their dance at the end of the first episode (pictured above). The love in those looks was so clear; it's no wonder that some fans thought the two actors, Dynevor and Page, were actually dating in real life. This set an astronomically high bar for future romances on this show.\n\nHowever, there's a scene between these two in season one that many have interpreted to be, at the very worst, a form of sexual assault, and at best, somewhat problematic.\n\nSimon forgives Daphne, but we can't rank them any higher.\n\nWe finally got some progress with Penelope and Colin's relationship in season three. Previously, Penelope had been obsessed with Colin, but Colin only saw her as a friend and publicly mocked the idea of courting her.\n\nThings changed in season three when Colin realized his feelings for Penelope had always been romantic, and they finally got married.\n\nCoughlan and Newton have natural chemistry in real life, but we'd argue it didn't always translate on screen. \"Polin\" has one of the best sex scenes of the series in episode five of season three, showing the perfect mix of pure adoration and lust for each other, but the rest of their relationship wasn't beloved by everyone.\n\nMany fans have complained that their relationship was rushed last season, and they weren't able to fully connect until the season's end because they both hid their true selves for various reasons.\n\nIn season four, they're happily married with a son, and Colin is obsessed with Penelope, so we have no doubts about these crazy kids.\n\nIn \"Queen Charlotte,\" Violet Bridgerton vowed she would try to find love again after the death of her husband, Edmund Bridgerton (Rupert Evans).\n\nViolet had her shot at this in \"Bridgerton\" season three when she met Marcus Anderson (Daniel Francis), the estranged brother of her closest friend, Lady Danbury. Marcus is incredibly charming — his beauty often made Violet stutter and stare. However, he's not just a pretty face; he also related to her grief because he lost his first wife.\n\nSeason four leans into this relationship full-steam ahead. They share longing looks across crowded rooms, secret moments when Violet's kids aren't around, and a hot sex scene, proving that the youngsters aren't the only ones with a thriving love life in the Ton.\n\nIn \"Bridgerton,\" Queen Charlotte is always shadowed by her most trusty aide, Brimsley (Hugh Sachs), but we didn't learn much about him until \"Queen Charlotte.\"\n\nIn the miniseries, in which Sam Clemmett played him, we discovered that Brimsley was secretly dating King George's head servant, Reynolds (Freddie Dennis).\n\nThroughout the season, they snuck off to have sex, found opportunities to hold hands, and talked about their future together, but it certainly was not perfect.\n\nSince Reynolds had to keep King George's illness a secret, he kept Brimsley at arm's length until the end of the season, and their relationship was, as a whole, a huge secret. Yet despite their fighting, they always found themselves together again.\n\nBrimsley and Reynolds quickly became a fan-favorite couple, and we hope the \"Bridgerton\" creators eventually answer what happens to their relationship after the events of \"Queen Charlotte.\"\n\nIf \"Heated Rivalry\" proved anything, it's that audiences are just as thirsty for gay romances, too.\n\nWith the caveat that we've really only seen them kiss twice and share one steamy scene in a stairwell, these two are on track to be one of \"Bridgerton's\" best couples.\n\nOne of the fun things about Benedict and Sophie (Yerin Ha) is that Benedict doesn't know his mysterious Lady in Silver, whom he met and immediately fell in love with at a masquerade ball, is his mother's newest servant, with whom he also feels an inexplicably strong connection. Delicious.\n\nThe forbidden love vibes are also strong with Benophie — Sophie's in a different class and could never be with a Bridgerton (at least, not in the way she wants). But that doesn't stop them from yearning. So much yearning.\n\nWe reserve the right to change our minds when part two comes out, but for now, we're obsessed.\n\nAnthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma are the best couple in the main \"Bridgerton\" series.\n\nThere was a clear attraction from their first meeting. Has a man ever been so infatuated with a woman as when Anthony sniffs the air around Kate?\n\nBut it was hard to say they were truly in love until the end of the first season because they spent more time bickering than giving longing stares, and they both let Anthony's courtship with Kate's sister, Edwina, go on a little too long.\n\nNow married, Kanthony is stronger than ever, and there was no competing with their chemistry in season three. In almost every scene, Anthony and Kate sought out a moment to talk or touch each other, or Anthony was declaring his love in the most extra way possible.\n\nThey also communicated a lot better and warmly supported each other throughout season three compared with season two.\n\nThey're sorely missed from season four, even though we get a small update that they're enjoying their time in India together with their newborn.\n\nDearest reader, Queen Charlotte and King George are the winners of this \"Bridgerton\" couples ranking.\n\nTheir love story in \"Queen Charlotte\" was one of the most sophisticated and developed romances in the Bridgerton franchise. Corey Mylchreest and India Amarteifio, who play young Charlotte and George, had impeccable chemistry from their first encounter. Even when they were fighting, it was hard not to see passion and love in their eyes every time they looked at each other.\n\nThe scene in episode five when Charlotte and George finally confessed their love was one of the most poetic and beautiful confession scenes in \"Bridgerton\" (and this is a show that has a lot of them).\n\nAnd the scene in the series finale where the older Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) and King George (James Fleet) are under the bed clearly showed that their passion and chemistry continued for their entire lives. Even in season four, Queen Charlotte is despondent at the idea of living without her husband.\n\nMany relationships in this ranking are sexy, inspiring, or pleasing to watch, but Charlotte and George's love story is the only one that left audiences in tears at the end. And that's why they deserve the chemistry crown.",

    "title": "20 Hacks Every Netflix User Should Know",
    "description": "Take control of your Netflix viewing experience.",
    "fullText": "Let's face it, Netflix is no longer cheap. And if you're dedicating your valuable time and resources towards watching Netflix, you might want to see more than the same 10 shows everyone else is watching.\n\nIf your evening routine is still just opening Netflix, scrolling aimlessly for 20 minutes, and settling for the same three shows, it's time for an upgrade. Hidden beneath the surface of that simple interface are dozens of powerful settings, secret search codes, and third-party tools that can completely overhaul your viewing experience.\n\nLike every other popular streaming service, Netflix lets you download movies and TV shows for offline viewing. Ad-free plans can download up to 100 items per device, while ad-supported plans can download 15 items. And as long as you go online once every 30 days, you can keep that media on your device as long as you want.\n\nAnd if you're running low on space or your downloads are slow, you can adjust download quality to fix that. To adjust quality, open the Netflix app, go to your Profile, tap the Menu button at the top (the three horizontal lines), then go to App Settings > Downloads > Video Quality. Here, choose between Standard or Higher based on your storage space or network.\n\nNow, just tap the Download button next to an episode, season, or movie to download it. You’ll find downloaded media in the Downloads section in your Profile tab, where you can watch and delete shows.\n\nNetflix has an option that lets you log out of any connected devices from its website. That includes every device that all members of your account are using. So if you want to take away TV access from a friend, or someone who's somehow snuck into your account, this is the place to go.\n\nClick the Profile icon and go to Account. Here, switch to the Devices tab and choose Access and devices. Then, find a device you want to log out from and click Sign Out. You can also click the Sign Out of All Devices button to log out all devices together.\n\nNetflix has an obscure setting that's so weirdly worded that you'd never think it's about data collection. By default, Netflix shares your privacy-protected contact information with third parties to display ads on third-party services. That is something you should disable, and it's done on a per-profile basis.\n\nClick the Profile icon, go to Account, switch to the Profiles tab, choose your profile, and go to the Privacy and data settings option. Finally, disable Allow matched identifier communications. Repeat this for all the profiles on your account.\n\nNetflix's password sharing crack down is in full swing. If you cannot get around it, it might be time to create your own account. But that doesn't mean you need to start fresh with the algorithm. Netflix has a feature called Transfer Profiles that can help you take all your data from an old account to a new one.\n\nOpen the Netflix website and choose your profile. Then, click the Profile icon at the top and go to Transfer Profile. This will open up a wizard that'll walk you through the next steps. Click Start Profile Transfer and choose if you want to transfer to a brand-new account or to an existing one. Netflix will help you set up a new account with all your data already on it. If you're transferring to an existing account, you'll need to know the email and the password for the account. Follow the instructions to transfer your profile to a new account.\n\nWant to remove an embarrassing title from your Continue Watching list? Or perhaps a title that you’re never going to finish? Turns out you can help clear your Continue Watching List by removing a title from your Viewing Activity. As a bonus, this method also gets rid of any recommendations based on that content, as if you never watched it.\n\nTo do this, go to Netflix’s Viewing Activity page (you can also get there from Account > Profiles > Your Profile > Viewing Activity).\n\nClick the little Hide button next to the title that you want to remove. Confirm in the next step, and the title will disappear from your watch list.\n\nIf you're fine with Netflix tuning your recommendations around something you've watched, but still want to remove it from your Continue Watching list, you can do that, too. Depending on the platform, the steps are slightly different.\n\nIf you're watching in the mobile app, tap on the three-dotted menu icon below the show or movie's poster, and choose Remove from row. From the popup, tap the Remove button to confirm. On the website, simply hover over the thumbnail and click the \"X\" button to remove it from the list. If you're using the TV app, press and hold your remote's main button to go to the details page. Then, tap the Remove from Continue Watching button.\n\nIt's no secret that Netflix has a different media catalog for each country. Depending on which one you choose, you can use a VPN to bypass this. You can access all the K-dramas streaming in Korea, while sitting in your home in the U.S. You can use a free VPN, sure, but for fast streaming, a paid and secure VPN might be the best option (NordVPN is a secure and budget-friendly option). As a bonus, it will also encrypt your traffic and protect your data when you're connected to public networks.\n\nIf you watch Netflix on the way to work, or if you have a spotty internet connection, the Smart Downloads feature can be a game changer. Once enabled, this will automatically delete completed episodes and replace them with subsequent episodes when you’re back on Wi-Fi. You can also turn on \"Downloads for you,\" which automatically downloads content Netflix thinks you'll like. You can enable these features on the iOS and Android apps from Profile > Menu > App Settings > Smart Downloads.\n\nIf you like watching Netflix while you’re out and about, it can eat into your mobile data plan pretty easily. Netflix’s data saver mode can help with that. In the Netflix app, go to Profile > Menu > App Settings > Cellular Data Usage. Here, disable the Automatic feature and switch to the Save Data option. This will adjust video quality while you're off wifi to allow for about six hours of playback per GB of data.\n\nIt would be a shame to pay for the 4K Netflix plan but only watch in 720p because you didn’t adjust your settings. Go to Netflix’s playback settings page, and from the Data Usage Per Screen option, switch to the High option. Now, you’ll get the best quality for the device or screen that you’re on.\n\nNetflix loves autoplaying. Whether the app’s playing the next episode or a new movie right after you’re done watching something, or playing previews on the home screen, it can get pretty annoying.\n\nYou can disable both features on a profile-by-profile basis. After opening the Netflix website, go to the Profiles screen. Here, click the Manage Profiles button and choose the profile where you want to disable these features.\n\nNow, uncheck Autoplay next episode and Autoplay previews. Click the Save button to save your preferences.\n\nAre Netflix's default subtitles too hard to read? You can change the subtitle font, color, and size. From the Netflix website, click the Profile icon and choose Account. Here, switch to the Profiles tab and select your profile. Now, choose the Subtitle Appearance option.\n\nFrom here, you can change the subtitle font, text size, shadow, background color, and window color. Once you’re done, tap the Save button to save your settings.\n\nWhen you’re watching a foreign language film, Netflix has a habit of defaulting to English language dubbing. Sadly, there’s no setting to stop Netflix from doing that, but there’s always a way to switch to the original audio in the Netflix player. When you’re watching something, go to the Subtitles menu, and from the Audio section, switch to the Original audio.\n\nIf you share your Netflix account with your friends or family, your profile isn’t exactly private. Others can see what you’ve been watching, and they can also use your profile and mess up your recommendations.\n\nIf you want to protect your profile (especially if you share your account with your kids), click the Profiles icon and choose the Account option. Switch to the Profiles tab, choose your profile, and go to the Profile Lock section. Then, click Create a Profile lock.\n\nEnter your account password, and from the next page, enter the four-digit pin and click the Save button. The next time you open Netflix, you’ll need to enter this pin to access your profile.\n\nIf you’re sharing your Netflix account with your kids or teenagers, you might want to block adult content. To do this, go to the Profiles tab in your Account and choose your profile. Here, go to the Adjust Parental Controls section and enter your account password.\n\nFrom the top, you can change the profile's maturity rating (7+ to 18+). If you want, you can also turn the current profile into a children’s profile, which only shows content suitable for children. From the bottom, you can even choose to block a particular TV show or movie. Once you’re done, click the Save button.\n\nNetflix has finally added an option for dialogue-only subtitles, and while they're not on every show, the company plans to support them on at least every new Netflix Original going forward.\n\nThis new subtitle option removes commentary and stage directions from subtitles. So you won't see details about the background music or heavy breathing. You'll just see character dialogue.\n\nTo switch to this option, start streaming a compatible show or movie on Netflix and head to the Subtitles section. Here, choose English (or the language of your choice) in the Audio section, and English (or, again, whatever language you want) in the Subtitles section. If you want to revert to the classic subtitles style, switch to an option with \"(CC)\" in the name.\n\nNetflix's search feature is pretty great, but the way its app organizes content kind of sucks. On the home screen, you might keep seeing the same popular content repeated in different sections. If you want to discover new content in a particular genre, style, or language, there is a better way. And that's to use Netflix's secret codes.\n\nNetflix has codes for every kind of movie category and subcategory that you can imagine. There are 20 broad categories to start with, but there are 267 categories in total, each with their own unique code. You can find a list of all the secret codes at Netflix-Codes.com. Just enter the code in the Netflix search bar (or click the linked URL) to browse content tagged with it.\n\nYou can also enter these codes into a Netflix URL yourself. So, to view \"Asian action movies\", you'd navigate to https://netflix.com/browse/genre/77232.\n\nThere's nothing quite as annoying as accidentally brushing your phone or tablet screen while watching Netflix and pausing a movie, skipping ahead, or turning on subtitles. To me, this happens mostly when I'm traveling or watching in bed. Netflix has a solution for this, though, in the form of a screen lock. When you're watching something, tap the screen to bring up player controls, and then tap the Lock button. Now, no matter how much you swipe, you won't end up changing the volume randomly. How to unlock it, you ask? Tap on the screen again, tap the Screen Locked button, and tap once again to unlock the screen.\n\nTrim is a neat little Chrome extension that provides you contextual information about movies and TV shows, so you don't have to open different websites to find them. You'll see ratings and reviews from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes for any given show right on its Netflix page, saving you a click before you choose what you want to watch.\n\nLastly, you can try the Netflix Enhanced Chrome extension to add some small quality-of-life improvements to Netflix. It automatically skips intros, and plays the next episode immediately after the current one ends, saving you some clicks and valuable time. You can also use nifty keyboard shortcuts, like pressing \"N\" to go to the next episode, using the arrow key to change the volume, and more.",

    "description": "If you can't wait for all of season four of Netflix's \"Bridgerton,\" you may want to read some historical romance books that spark the same flame.",
    "fullText": "Though it's the fourth season of the Netflix series, Sophie and Benedict's story is actually the third book in Julia Quinn's \"Bridgerton\" series, and it's definitely worth reading if you haven't yet.\n\nIn the novel, the gentle reader finds Sophie at a crossroads. An illegitimate child, Sophie's biological father raised her as his ward, but after he died, her stepmother forced her to become a servant for herself and her two daughters. She finally gets the chance to be a proper lady of the ton for one night when she attends the Bridgerton masquerade ball in disguise. There, she crosses paths with Benedict Bridgerton, and they share an evening that will change both of them forever.\n\nTry as he might, Benedict can't forget the mystery woman he met at the masquerade, who disappeared without even telling him her name. He's been searching for her for years when he crosses paths with Sophie again — this time, when she is working as a maid — but he doesn't recognize her.\n\nHer familiarity nags at Benedict, but he soon finds himself drawn to the Sophie he knows now. Their relationship seems impossible because of their social standings and because of the piece of his heart that still belongs to his mysterious masquerade woman, but true love always finds a way.\n\nA \"Cinderella\" retelling full of longing and forbidden love, \"An Offer from a Gentleman\" showcases Quinn at her finest.\n\n\"Bringing Down the Duke\" is the first installment in Evie Dunmore's \"A League of Extraordinary Women\" series.\n\nIt follows Annabelle Archer, one of the first women admitted to the University of Oxford in 1879. Annabelle is a scholarship student, and her financial support depends on her commitment to recruiting influential men to join the suffragette movement.\n\nAnnabelle doesn't know how she'll convince Sebastian Devereux, the Duke of Montgomery, to help her cause. His support is crucial because he directly influences the Queen's policies, but the removed Sebastian is more interested in finding a suitable wife than in women's rights.\n\nWorst of all, neither Annabelle nor Sebastian expected the palpable attraction between them, threatening to derail everything they were both working toward. They'll have to see which is more powerful: their goals or their feelings for each other.\n\nIf you love the ensemble cast of \"Bridgerton,\" Krystal Marquis' \"The Davenports\" is the perfect addition to your to-be-read list.\n\nInspired by the true story of Charles Richard Patterson, Marquis' novel follows the family of William Davenport, a previously enslaved man who became a successful business owner with the Davenport Carriage Company. By 1910, his family is wealthy and secure, and his children — particularly his daughters Olivia and Helen — have become fixtures of high society.\n\nWhen \"The Davenports\" begins, Olivia is set on marrying a suitable match until she finds herself drawn to Washington DeWight, a civil rights activist, while Helen can't stop thinking about the man who is supposed to be courting her sister, Jacob Lawrence. Meanwhile, the girls' former close friend and current maid, Amy-Rose, and Olivia's best friend, Ruby, end up in a love triangle with John Davenport, Olivia and Helen's charming brother, until Ruby falls for someone she never anticipated.\n\nFull of heart and no shortage of romance, the first installment of \"The Davenports\" series will scratch the same itch as \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nLike \"Bridgerton,\" Diana Gabaldon's historical romance \"Outlander\" became a successful TV series, but unlike Quinn's works, her nine-book series comes with a side of magic.\n\nWhen \"Outlander\" begins, former combat nurse Claire Randall is trying to find her footing after the end of World War II in 1945. In an attempt to find a new normal, Claire and her husband Frank visit the Scottish Highlands, but a walk through a stone circle sends Claire back in time to 1743, when war was the backdrop of Scotland.\n\nClaire is desperate to return to her life, but to stay alive, she is forced to marry the surprisingly kind warrior, Jamie Fraser. As time passes, her reluctant marriage to Jamie becomes a passion Claire has never known. Will she return to her life in the future or take on an adventure in the past she never expected?\n\nKJ Charles' \"The Magpie Lord\" has all the aristocratic fun of \"Bridgerton\" with the added flair of dark magic.\n\nIt's been two decades since Lucien Vaudrey set foot in London following his exile to China. When his father and brother suddenly die, Lucien has to return to a life he never expected as the new Lord Crane.\n\nHowever, his earldom comes with the same adversaries his father had, leaving Lucien in danger of nefarious magic. He enlists the help of Stephen Day, a magician who can't stand the Crane family, to help him.\n\nStephen expects to loathe Lucien as he did his relatives, but to his surprise, Lucien is relaxed, tattooed, and clearly wants him. As Stephen's feelings for Lucien deepen, evil continues to invade the lord's home, putting them both at risk.\n\nAmanda Briars decides to take her sexuality into her own hands in \"Suddenly You\" by Lisa Kleypas.\n\nAs a 30th birthday gift to herself, author and spinster Amanda decides to seek out a male companion so she can experience intimacy. So when Jack Delvin, a publisher who wants to work with her, appears on her doorstep, she assumes he's there for a very different reason, leading to a night of passion neither anticipated.\n\nAfter their encounter, Amanda and Jack still have to work together, and neither can ignore their attraction. Will their different backgrounds keep them apart, or will love bring them together?\n\nIf you want a romance like \"Bridgerton\" with a touch of darkness, \"The Wisteria Society of Lady Scoundrels\" by India Holton will hit the spot.\n\nAlthough Cecilia Bassingwaite appears to be a demure Victorian woman, she's actually a thief. She uses her societal standing to swindle goods from England's upper class as a member of the Wisteria Society of Lady Scoundrels.\n\nAssassin for hire Ned Lightbourne is tasked with taking Cecilia out for his boss, Captain Morvath, but everything changes when Ned lays eyes on her.\n\nCecilia and Ned have no choice but to work together to save the Wisteria Society from Morvath's wrath — drawing them closer and closer together.\n\nIn \"Rebel\" by Beverly Jenkins, Valinda Lacy is building a new life for herself in Reconstruction-era New Orleans.\n\nOriginally from New York City, Valinda has big dreams of helping rebuild the city, but her hopes are dashed when ruffians make a target of her and the school she created.\n\nArchitect Captain Drake LeVeq steps in to help Valinda and is immediately smitten with her. Drake finds everything about Valinda alluring, especially her independence, so he's devastated to learn she has a responsible fiancé waiting for her in New York.\n\nThe more time Val spends in New Orleans with Drake, the less she wants to return to the life set out for her.\n\nThe first installment of Jenkins' \"Women Who Dare\" series, \"Rebel,\" is exciting and steamy.\n\nThe first installment in Tessa Dare's \"Girl Meets Duke\" series is \"The Duchess Deal,\" a perfect story for fans of the marriage-of-convenience trope.\n\nThe Duke of Ashbury rarely leaves his home after the war, hiding the burns and scars he took home with him. However, he needs to have a child, so he has to get married.\n\nWhen his fiancée abruptly pulls out of the wedding, and he spots his seamstress, Emma Gladstone, with the dress in hand, he gets Emma to agree to step in and become the duchess.\n\nThe duke plans to keep Emma at arm's length, only visiting her bed at night to produce an heir. That won't work for Emma, though, who insists they dine together every night. And the longer Emma is in the Duke of Ashbury's world, the more enamored she is.\n\nLike \"Bridgerton,\" Liana De la Rosa's \"Ana María and the Fox\" takes place during a society season in Victorian London.\n\nMexican heiress Ana María Luna Valdés ends up in London with her sisters when the French occupy her home country, giving her the chance to see what life is like when she isn't under her father's watchful eye. She can't help but notice Gideon Fox, a politician with ambitious plans to bring an end to the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nGideon is sure he doesn't have time for a romance with anyone, no matter how alluring he finds Ana. To his dismay, he has no choice but to protect her when a rival politician makes advances on her — nor does he have a choice in the feelings he develops for her.\n\nIf you like the class tension in \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" Quinn's \"A Night Like This\" might be right up your alley.\n\nThe second novel in the \"Smythe-Smith Quartet\" follows Anne Wynter, the governess for three cousins in the Smythe-Smith family (who will be familiar to fans of \"Bridgerton\"). Being a governess isn't her dream job, but it works for Anne, especially since it helps her keep her real identity private.\n\nAnne is hopeful she can maintain her low profile until Daniel Smythe-Smith, the Earl of Winstead, returns to town, and he immediately sets his sights on her. Anne has had no trouble resisting men in the past, but there's something about Daniel that stirs feelings in her she never anticipated.\n\nWhen enemies from Daniel's past threaten not only him but Anne, he'll show her just how far he's willing to go to protect her.\n\nLike \"Bridgerton,\" the \"Bedwyn Saga\" follows a rambunctious family, and the first installment, \"Slightly Married,\" focuses on the second eldest son, Aidan Bedwyn.\n\nAidan might look tough, but underneath it all, the colonel has a soft heart. That warmth leads him to visit Ringwood Manor after one of his soldiers died, determined to care for the man's sister in his stead.\n\nInstead of finding a grieving, helpless woman, he meets Eve, an enchanting and fearless woman who quickly makes clear that Aidan's help is the last thing she wants. However, when Aidan offers to marry her so she can keep her home, Eve feels she has no choice but to accept.\n\nAlthough Aidan is immediately drawn to Eve, the pair agree to a loveless marriage, but one kiss may undo everything they had planned.",

    "description": "Here's everything you need to know about the adrenaline trip that will be \"Skyscraper Live\" on Netflix",
    "fullText": "Calling all adrenaline junkies, Netflix has a broadcast specifically for you this week. Well, it’s specifically for adrenaline junkies who are probably not also stressed out by heights.\n\nOn Friday, professional climber Alex Honnold will be scaling his next mountain — except it’s not a mountain. Instead, he’ll be free-climbing a literal skyscraper, and yes, free-climbing means exactly what you think it does. He’ll have no ropes or harnesses attached, no safety nets to land in, he’s just…climbing a building.\n\nThe climb will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Netflix, on Friday, Jan. 23. It will be streamed live, so you can see the whole thing.\n\nAlex Hannold is a professional rock climber, who you might recognize from the documentary “Free Solo.” He’s a veteran at climbing.\n\nHannold will be scaling Taipei 101, one of the tallest buildings in the world. As you likely guessed from its name, the building is in Taiwan.\n\nIn total, Taipei 101 has, well, 101 stories. It’s 1,667 feet tall.\n\nIn Hannold’s own words: “Why not?” According to the climber, the building is “possible, which a lot of skyscrapers aren’t — it’s uniquely suited for climbing.”\n\nIt appears not. Hannold will truly solo climb and he admitted to Tudum himself that “My life is on the line.”\n\nAccording to Hannold himself, if something goes wrong, he’ll probably die, as he explained to CNN during a recent sit-down interview. However, as he noted, with this particular building, there are a lot of balconies spread out accross a long stretch of the climb “The geometry of the building, the shape of the building is such that you actually could fall in tons of places and not actually die,” Hannold described, “which makes it in some ways safer than a lot of rock-climbing objectives.”\n\nIn the same interview, Hannold described it as a low-risk, high-consequence activity — meaning that, most likely, he’ll incur no injury at all, but if something goes wrong, the stakes are extremely high. In contrast, he describes sports football as high-risk, lower-consequence, since athletes regularly have career-ending, but not life-ending, accidents on the field.\n\nProducers have also clarified that there will be a 10-second delay, and if the worst should happen, they will cut away.\n\nThe post ‘Skyscraper Live’: Where to Watch, Who’s Climbing and What Happens If He Falls appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "title": "How Netflix's stock lost its FANG-era mojo",
    "description": "The streaming giant is putting a lot of cash to work, and it's not growing as quickly as investors want.",
    "fullText": "The last decade in the stock market has been dominated by two distinct eras.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, \"FAANG stocks\" were all the rage. The elite crew of Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) represented the big winners of the mobile and cloud-computing explosion.\n\nIn more recent years, the Magnificent 7 — populated by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — has taken the reins. Driven by immense optimism over the future profitability of AI, the group has become a market-moving behemoth.\n\nSomewhere, during that transition, one piece of the FAANG cohort lost its elite status and did not roll over into the Mag 7: Netflix.\n\nThe exclusion makes sense. Netflix isn't known as an AI stock, so it doesn't naturally fit with the Mag 7. And based on the relative underperformance of Netflix shares over the last five years, compared to every stock in the group but Amazon, it's clear investors have accepted its spot away from the \"cool table\" in the cafeteria.\n\nSo what exactly is up with Netflix lately? Its latest earnings report from this week offers a good encapsulation of the company's recent issues:\n\nNetflix's pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery is expected to add hundreds of millions in costs in 2026. This comes alongside plans to boost TV-show and film spending by 10%.\n\nThe company is forecasting revenue growth of roughly 13% this year, down from 16% in 2025. And it's going to get more expensive to sustain that growth if Netflix continues its push into pricier new areas like live sports — a key push in its battle with YouTube over viewer eyeballs.\n\nThe $11 billion of free cash flow forecasted by Netflix missed analyst estimates.\n\nShares dropped as much as 6% before finishing 2% lower, at a one-year low. The prolonged decline can be traced back to mid-2025.\n\nNetflix's two prior earnings reports, in July and October, were among the main culprits. The company faced many of the same issues as its elite Mag 7 peers — namely sky-high expectations, sensitivity to heavy spending, and surprise tax charges.\n\nThe main difference is that Netflix doesn't have the backstop of the AI trade. It hasn't been given the same benefit of the doubt that its big spending will translate into gold-plated earnings growth.\n\nStill, on the heels of Netflix's multimonth slump, analysts are predominantly bullish. 65% of analysts have a \"buy\" on the stock at current levels, while just 4% have a \"sell.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley says the company's progress towards quickly building a $3 billion-plus advertising business is being underrated by the market. Other firms, meanwhile, simply think the stock has fallen so much that its valuation looks attractive.\n\nThe question now becomes if investors will buy in and start pushing Netflix back to the great heights it once enjoyed.",

When I finally quit doomscrolling through Instagram and TikTok and watch an actual movie or TV show, I feel like I've just spent the afternoon studying physics. Platforms like Netflix, which could once be seen as time-wasting entertainment, now seem like antidotes to endless, useless scrolling.\n\nBut Netflix doesn't seem to appreciate its new role. Instead, the company apparently sees short-form video apps—and smartphones themselves—as a direct threat to its business, and is jumping on the bandwagon. It's not only that Netflix is reportedly now making content with phone scrollers in mind, encouraging creators to craft dialogue that makes their shows and movies easy to understand even if you're not actually paying attention.\n\nNo Netflix also wants to position its mobile app as an actual competitor to TikTok and Instagram, by introducing a short-form video feed directly within the app.\n\nThe company officially introduced its plans for short-form video during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters announced the company will roll out a new app later this year that will include its take on the vertical video feed. This isn't totally new, as the company has been experimenting with vertical video feeds since May. But it's the first time we've seen a larger announcement about how Netflix plans to integrate the short-form experience directly into its app.\n\nUnlike TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, you won't hop on the Netflix app to find short-form videos from independent creators. Instead, Netflix will serve users clips from Netflix-distributed shows and movies in a scrollable TikTok-style feed. You might swipe through this feed and see clips from Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, or His & Hers. Many of us already waste our time watching clips from shows and movies on other platforms—often cropped, slowed down or sped up, in low-quality, and besieged by artifacts meant to throw off copyright claims. Netflix obviously won't need to do this, so I expect the experience will be filled with high-quality videos (depending on how you define \"quality\" of course).\n\nIt won't just be TV shows and movies on the feed. Netflix also has big plans for its video podcasts, as evidenced by recent programs like The Pete Davidson Show and recent deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia to bring existing podcasts to its platform. Expect Netflix to sprinkle clips from these video podcasts into the short-form feed to create an experience that sounds not too far off from scrolling through other apps. How many clips you do see from video podcasts, TV shows, and movies on TikTok?\n\nAs Netflix inches closer to acquiring Warner Bros., you might soon be seeing a lot of official short-form content in the Netflix app. If and when the acquisition closes, I wouldn't be surprised to see clips from HBO shows like A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, The White Lotus, and Euphoria.\n\nI get the move from a business perspective: Netflix is likely losing subscribers' attention due to the addictive nature of vertical video apps. But do any of us really need another app to scroll through, especially when we're already paying for access to the full content to begin with? Maybe could be a helpful avenue to find new shows and movies to watch, but in all likelihood, it will just be be another addictive time-waster. I have too many of those in my life as it is.",

    "description": "Welcome back, \"Star Search.\"",
    "fullText": "When Netflix isn't spending its time trying to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, it seems the company is actually adding new features to its subscription service. Netflix is always adding new shows and movies, which is what most users are looking for in the platform, but that's not all you can expect from your account. In fact, Netflix is now rolling out an interactive experience for its live competition shows, allowing subscribers to cast votes in real-time.\n\nNetflix announced the change in a press release on Tuesday, and also revealed the first show to officially run with real-time voting: Star Search. Netflix is bringing back the American Idol precursor tonight at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT), and will allow viewers to choose which contestant they like best alongside \"millions of others.\"\n\nNetflix says it first tested the feature with the show Dinner Time Live with David Chang, and \"learned firsthand how members appreciated the seamless and integrated ways they could participate in the series.\" I don't think you need a focus group to know that people like sharing their opinions on things, but then, I'm not a Netflix exec.\n\nThe company clarified in its press release that only live events will work with real-time voting. If you watch a show after it airs, you won't be able to cast your vote—which, obviously, makes sense. The show doesn't really need to know who you'd pick as a winner after the winner has already been chosen—though Netflix could always use the extra user data, I'm sure.\n\nStar Search is the only show at this time that supports this feature, but Netflix says more real-time voting shows are on the way.\n\nNetflix says that when you watch a live event, you'll be able to vote when watching on TV or a streaming device. You won't be able to vote if you're watching in a web browser, nor will you be able to vote if you rewind, pause, or tune-in late.\n\nWhen you join a live program, make sure you do so on a smart TV, supported streaming device (such as Apple TV, Fire TV, or Roku), or the Netflix mobile app. If you want to watch in a web browser, you can still vote on your phone at the same time.\n\nNetflix will prompt you when it's time to vote. You'll see a 1–5 star rating appear on the screen. Click on tap on the star level you want for each performer. Note that each profile only has one chance to vote per performance, so you can't issue another vote after you cast one—you'll just need to wait until the next performance.",

    "description": "Actor Matt Damon said Netflix wants action movies to reiterate plot lines multiple times because people are on their phones while watching a movie.",
    "fullText": "Netflix wants to change the way action movies are made amid the never-ending battle for our sustained attention, according to \"Bourne\" actor Matt Damon.\n\nIn an interview on the \"Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, Damon and longtime collaborator and friend Ben Affleck spoke about their latest experience costarring in and coproducing their first Netflix-exclusive heist film, \"The Rip,\" which was released Friday. The two actors talked about how streaming and short-form video platforms have upended the way movies are consumed, made, and sold to audiences.\n\nDamon said Netflix is now asking for action films to have bigger sequences occur within the first five minutes of the movie and suggesting that actors reiterate the plot line to cater to viewers who are on their phones.\n\nThe actor said the \"standard way\" he learned to make an action film was to have the finale — \"the big one with all the explosions\" that a production spends most of its money on — occur in the third act.\n\n\"Now, they're like, 'Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay tuned in. And you know it wouldn't be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they're watching,'\" he said. \"And so then it's going to really start to infringe on how we're telling a story.\"\n\nDamon didn't specify if Netflix gave the instruction to the actor and producer for his latest heist movie.\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment sent during the weekend.\n\nAffleck added that the suggestions aren't reflected in every new action film or series coming out on Netflix. The actor pointed to \"Adolescence,\" a crime miniseries that has episodes shot in one continuous take. The show was released in March.\n\nDamon said he felt the show was an exception.\n\n\"My feeling is just that it demonstrates that you don't need to do any of that\" stuff, Affleck said.\n\nHe later added, \"It's like supply and demand. People want to look at their phones, they look at TikTok, they're going to do that. I think what you can do is make shit the best you can. Make it really good.\"",

    "description": "Smart and her family open up about her shocking 2002 abduction in the middle of the night in a new Netflix documentary out Jan. 21",
    "fullText": "Elizabeth Smart opens up about the horrors she endured for nine months in the new Netflix documentary, Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart\n\nStreaming Jan. 21, the documentary has Smart giving brutal details about being raped by Brian David Mitchell up to four times a day, being walked like a dog with a cable around her neck and tethered to a tree for long stretches\n\nShe is joined in the documentary by her family, witnesses and law enforcement, who provide their perspectives to Smart's harrowing story\n\nStanding in a weather-worn tent in the foothills of Utah just after being kidnapped from her bedroom in the middle of the night, Elizabeth Smart wasn’t sure what was going to happen next.\n\nSometime after 1 a.m., on June 5, 2002, Smart, then 14, awoke to a scary-looking man with a full beard standing over her bed and ordering her to come with him.\n\nHolding a knife to her neck, the man, Brian David Mitchell, then 48, a self-styled prophet who went by the name Immanuel, marched the terrified teenager out of the backdoor of her family’s Salt Lake City home, into the backyard and up into the rugged foothills to a desolate campsite.\n\nInside the tent at the campsite, Mitchell’s wife, Wanda Barzee, then 56, who went by the name Hephzibah, told Smart to take off her pajamas and put on a loose-fitting robe.\n\nOtherwise, the older woman explained, she was going to have Mitchell come in there and “rip the clothes off of you,” Smart says in the new Netflix documentary, Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart, debuting Jan. 21.\n\nA happily married mother of three, Smart, 38, has spoken out about her nightmarish ordeal before. She’s authored several bestselling books about her experience, started the Elizabeth Smart Foundation to help end sexual violence and used her platform as one of the most well-known survivors of all time to advocate for others.\n\nWhat’s different this time is that she is telling her story alongside her father, Ed Smart, 70, her sister, Mary Katherine Smart, 33, witnesses who saw Smart wearing a veil with her head covered but didn’t realize she was the missing girl authorities had been searching for and members of law enforcement who worked the case.\n\nHaving so many voices in the documentary “gives the story so much more perspective,” Smart tells PEOPLE.\n\nShe hopes being so honest about the brutal treatment she endured, including being raped up to four times a day, being kept in a dark hole, and being chained up for hours, will help others better understand the realities victims face during and well after they are violated.\n\n“I want other survivors to know they're not alone, that actually there's so many of us,\" she says.\n\nThat surreal night, Smart waited for Mitchell to come into the tent. As a self-professed “late bloomer,” the thought of what might come next was unthinkable, and still shrouded a bit in mystery.\n\nShortly before the abduction, she remembers, “My friend told me kind of what sex really was and I was like, ‘What? My parents have done that six times? That is terrible!’ And that was all I knew about sex.”\n\nWhat she knew from church is that sex before marriage was strictly taboo. “Otherwise, you’re dirty, you’re ruined,” she says. “They used all sorts of analogies like when you have sex before marriage, it’s like someone chewed a piece of gum -- and nobody wants a chewed-up piece of gum.”\n\nMoments later, Mitchell strode into the tent and declared that he was going to make Smart his wife, right there and then. She screamed, “No!” she recalls, prompting him to levy the first of many threats. \"If you ever scream out like that again, I will kill you,” he told her.\n\nThen it came time for them to “consummate our marriage,” she recalls him telling her. She tried to stop him, but could not.\n\n“I was sobbing,” she says. “I begged him to stop. I remember it just being so painful.”\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nThe assault caused her so much pain that when he left the tent she remembers blood running down her thighs before passing out.\n\nThen came a different type of pain. When she awoke, all she could think about was “being that chewed up piece of gum, being ruined beyond repair, feeling like I'd lost all my worth.”\n\nThat common misconception, she notes, “took years to get over. It took years to be like, any guy who wouldn't want to be with me because of what's happened is not worthy of me.”\n\nConvicted in 2010 of kidnapping Smart, Mitchell was sentenced to life in prison. Convicted of her role in the crimes, Barzee was released from prison in 2018. She was arrested in May 2025 after allegedly visiting two Utah parks, which violated her status as a registered sex offender.\n\nFor more about Elizabeth Smart and her new Netflix documentary,",

    "title": "Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos tries to solve his movie problem",
    "description": "Netflix made streaming movies at home a big part of its pitch. Now, as it tries to buy Warner Bros. and its giant movie business, things are changing.",
    "fullText": "Netflix spent a lot of time arguing that the future of movies was watching them at home, not in theaters.\n\nNow Netflix wants to buy a movie studio that puts movies into theaters. So it's started saying that watching movies in theaters is good, sometimes.\n\nThat's the messaging Netflix has been trying to make ever since it announced plans to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in December. But that messaging hasn't been satisfying to some people who care a lot about the future of movies in theaters.\n\nWhich is why Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos appeared in The New York Times on Friday, talking about how much he likes the business of putting movies into theaters. Again, it's an idea he's been talking about since he announced the (proposed) Netflix/WBD deal on December 5.\n\nSarandos did say one thing he thinks is new and important: A commitment to keep all future Warner Bros. movies in theaters for at least 45 days:\n\nThat 45-day commitment won't mean much to most people. But Sarandos definitely thinks it matters — \"I'm giving you a hard number.\"\n\nThe very abbreviated backstory: Sarandos and Netflix have spent years fighting the idea of a theatrical \"window\" — the amount of time movies spend exclusively in theaters before they move to platforms like streaming services, rentals, and purchases. Their general argument: If people want to watch movies at home — that is, on Netflix — they should get to do that.\n\nNetflix has periodically had to soften that stance to accommodate high-profile movies and talent, which is why you could see Martin Scorcese's \"The Irishman\" in theaters for a few weeks before it came to Netfix in 2019, and why \"Barbie\" director Gretg Gerwig's \"Narnia\" will be in Imax theaters for a couple weeks this fall before it comes to Netflix. Netflix has also periodically debated its streaming-only/mostly stance internally.\n\nBut externally, Sarandos has been a huge promoter of the idea that the future of movies is at home — which happens to align with the fact that moviegoing has been in decline for years. That's not just because of Netflix, but because the internet gives people lots of other things to do besides going to theaters.\n\nNow, as he prepares to buy WBD, Sarandos has had to change his tune. The shortest version of his new one: We weren't in the business of putting movies into theaters, but if we buy WBD, we will be, so we'll do that.\n\nBut that hasn't convinced lots of people that a business built on streaming is going to become one that cares about theaters.\n\nIn part, that's because Sarandos also said things like \"our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members because that's what they're looking for,\" when announcing the deal. He's also said he hopes \"windows will evolve to be much more consumer-friendly to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker\" — which reasonable people believe means he intends for movies to spend less time in theaters.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount, the Hollywood studio that would like to buy WBD instead, has made a commitment to putting movies in theaters, and honoring \"healthy traditional windows\" as part of its talking points.\n\nSo now, Sarandos has planted a 45-day flag. Whether that mollifies Hollywood or anyone else is an open question.",

    "title": "David Ellison's Paramount is now suing Warner Bros. Discovery. Here's why.",
    "description": "Paramount Skydance is convinced its offer for Warner Bros. is better than Netflix's offer. Read CEO David Ellison's new letter to WBD shareholders.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison has chosen to continue the fight for control of Warner Bros. Discovery, this time in court.\n\nThe Paramount Skydance CEO has made eight attempts to buy WBD, all of which have been rebuffed. That includes his most recent $30-per-share bid, which was spurned in favor of Netflix's offer. Paramount is attempting to acquire the entire company, including its TV networks, such as CNN, TBS, and TNT. Netflix's cash-and-stock offer is $27.75 per share for just WBD's studio and streaming assets.\n\nNow, Paramount is suing WBD \n\nIf WBD's Global Networks business — the division that houses its cable TV networks — is worth substantially less than $2.25 per share, then Paramount's $30-per-share bid could look more attractive to shareholders than Netflix's proposal. Paramount has argued that WBD's cable channels have a $0-per-share equity value, implying they're worth about as much as the estimated $15 billion in debt that WBD intends to saddle them with.\n\n\"WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its 'risk adjustment' of our $30 per share all-cash offer,\" Ellison wrote to WBD investors.\n\nParamount is also initiating a so-called proxy fight where it tries to get representatives on WBD's board of directors.\n\nFor now, Paramount isn't raising the price of its bid. Instead, it is sticking with its all-cash, $30-per-share proposal in hopes that WBD shareholders will see something the board doesn't.\n\n\"WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount,\" Ellison wrote. \"But what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer.\"\n\nParamount appears to be set on finding ways it can win control of WBD without paying more money in a renewed bidding war.\n\n\"Paramount will continue to use all avenues to wrestle WBD away from Netflix,\" said Ross Benes, an analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. \"Lawsuits, shareholder appeals, proxy battles, and so on, individually have little chance of swinging the merger. These tactics are part of a broader strategy to keep pressing until something gives and then seizing on that opportunity.\"\n\nRead Ellison's full letter to WBD shareholders:\n\nDear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder,\n\nOver the last few days, following the decision by Warner Bros. Discovery (\"WBD\") not to engage with Paramount on our $30 per share cash offer to acquire all of WBD, and our reaffirmation of our commitment to delivering our superior offer to WBD shareholders, we keep getting the same question: what happens next?\n\nParamount started this process about four months ago with a private offer at a significant premium to WBD's $12.54 share price, and our pursuit culminated in the $30 per share all-cash, fully financed proposal we made before WBD entered into the Netflix transaction. When we learned of the terms of that transaction, which are inferior both financially and from the standpoint of timing and certainty of closing, we decided to bring our offer directly to you, through our tender offer.\n\nWe are committed to seeing our tender offer through. We understand, however, that unless the WBD board of directors decides to exercise its right to engage with us under the Netflix merger agreement (the \"Netflix Agreement\"), this will likely come down to your vote at a shareholder meeting. We do not know whether that will be at WBD's upcoming annual meeting or a special meeting. The \"advance notice\" window for WBD's 2026 annual meeting opens in three weeks, and Paramount will nominate a slate of directors who, in accordance with their fiduciary duties, will exercise WBD's right under the Netflix Agreement to engage on Paramount's offer and enter into a transaction with Paramount. In addition, Paramount will propose an amendment to WBD's bylaws to require WBD shareholder approval for any separation of Global Networks. If WBD calls a special meeting ahead of its annual meeting to vote on the Netflix Agreement, Paramount will solicit proxies against such approval. These actions, coupled with our tender offer, ensure that you get the final decision on which offer is better for you.\n\nWBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer. Our $30 per share in cash is simply more than Netflix's complex multi-variable consideration comprised of (a) $23.25 in cash plus (b) a number of Netflix shares currently worth $4.11 (at Friday's close) plus (c) the to-be-issued Global Networks equity which we have analyzed as having zero equity value1. In addition to not disclosing the value of the to-be-issued Global Networks spin off, WBD has not disclosed the mechanism by which any debt transferred from Global Networks to the Streaming & Studios segment reduces the cash and stock consideration payable to you.\n\nAlong with the WBD shareholders, we have asked for the customary financial disclosure a board is supposed to provide shareholders when making an investment recommendation. But in each of its 14D-9 filings, WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its \"risk adjustment\" of our $30 per share all-cash offer. WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer — and importantly, Delaware law has consistently required that such information be provided to shareholders. Following the process prescribed under Delaware law, we filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer.\n\nWe do not undertake any of these actions lightly. Make no mistake, our goal remains to have constructive discussions with WBD's Board to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of WBD shareholders. Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders. We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our December 4th offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us. Even as we read WBD's own narrative of its process, we are struck that there were few actual board meetings in the period leading up to the decision to accept an inferior transaction with Netflix. And we are surprised by the lack of transparency on WBD's part regarding basic financial matters. It just doesn't add up — much like the math on how WBD continues to favor taking less than our $30 per share all-cash offer for its shareholders.\n\nThe best outcome for you and for us would be if WBD's Board would exercise the right it has under the Netflix Agreement to engage with Paramount. If it does so, we will be open and constructive to secure the best path forward for WBD and each of you. We have demonstrated our willingness to listen carefully to any feedback we receive from WBD's Board and to respond by offering reasonable solutions — and that remains our mindset and approach.\n\nI believe in our vision for how we can bring these great companies together and deliver for consumers, the creative community and of course, for you. Paramount is committed, my family is committed, and hopefully this helps answer the question of what comes next.\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer",

    "title": "What will happen next in the war for Warner Bros. Discovery? Here are Paramount's options.",
    "description": "Paramount Skydance is still trying to stop Warner Bros. Discovery's Netflix deal. Here are the four most likely endings in the fight for WBD.",
    "fullText": "The war for Warner Bros. Discovery is getting intense.\n\nParamount Skydance isn't surrendering in its quest to buy WBD, even though its offers have been rejected eight times in favor of Netflix's bid.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison has criticized WBD for not selecting what he's called \"by far the superior offer.\"\n\nWBD has fired back, accusing Paramount of threatening lawsuits and leaking to the press. The company's board of directors said this week in a letter to shareholders that Paramount \"has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction.\"\n\nThere have been many twists and turns in Netflix and Paramount's battle for WBD, and the drama isn't over yet.\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios that could unfold.\n\nAlthough Paramount says its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD provides more value and less risk than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets, the company could up the ante.\n\nSeveral media insiders, including Disney's former top dealmaker, expect a renewed bidding war for WBD.\n\nTheir view got a boost when Paramount disclosed in a filing that Ellison had texted WBD CEO David Zaslav, saying that Paramount's $30-per-share proposal wasn't its \"best and final\" offer.\n\nWBD investors also seem to be counting on more fireworks, given that its stock is trading north of $28.50, close to $1 per share above Netflix's agreed-upon purchase price. That suggests shareholders believe either Ellison and company or Netflix will fork over more money before WBD changes hands.\n\nParamount might not need to offer another penny if a majority of WBD's shareholders tender their shares, which would put pressure on the board to reconsider its proposal.\n\nAs a public company, WBD's leadership is legally required to act in the best interests of its shareholders. Otherwise, its board could be sued. So, if WBD's investors overwhelmingly prefer Paramount's bid, the board could have no choice but to go with it.\n\nHowever, Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners, thinks Paramount won't convince a majority of WBD shareholders to tender their shares. Greenfield predicted that Paramount would then raise its offer to $32 per share, but that Netflix would respond by sweetening its offer, leading to Paramount eventually dropping its bid.\n\nUntil the Netflix deal closes, a competing proposal could come in, since WBD is a public company. Comcast drove up the eventual price of Disney's acquisition of Fox's studio by nearly $20 billion, even though its rival bid came in six months later.\n\nIf Paramount remains adamant that it has a superior proposal that wasn't chosen, it could sue WBD's board of directors, alleging negligence.\n\nWBD has acknowledged that possibility. Paramount \"has been aggressive in its engagement with WBD, has retained litigation counsel and has threatened litigation,\" WBD's board of directors wrote in a letter on Wednesday in which it rejected Paramount's latest offer.\n\nLawyer Raul Gastesi of Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella has taken note of Paramount's litigious posture and said that now that it has been turned down, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit.\"\n\nHowever, Reuben Miller, the head of antitrust at data intelligence firm Dealreporter, said that while Paramount is making waves in the court of public opinion, he believes they \"would rather come with an increased offer and avoid litigation than roll the dice in Delaware court.\"\n\nEven if Paramount decides not to sue, there's a chance WBD shareholders could take legal action against WBD's board.\n\nWhile Paramount has taken a hands-on approach to its WBD bid so far, it could let the chips fall and move on if its proposal doesn't win over enough WBD shareholders.\n\nInstead of spending more than $100 billion on WBD, Paramount could put money toward another acquisition, or simply invest in improving its technology and original content.",

    "description": "Netflix is releasing a film adaptation of Emily Henry's \"People We Meet on Vacation\" on January 9. Here's what to read after you watch.",
    "fullText": "One of the most highly anticipated book-to-screen adaptations of 2026 is undoubtedly \"People We Meet on Vacation\" by Emily Henry.\n\nHenry smashed onto the romance scene in 2020 with \"Beach Read\" and has written five more books since then, each of which has skyrocketed to The New York Times bestseller list.\n\nHenry's summer romance books often approach love with a sense of honesty and fun that the genre needs to thrive. Her characters may be enemies who find themselves living next door to each other or best friends who are scared to risk it all for something more, as is the case in \"People We Meet on Vacation,\" which has been turned into a film set to debut on Netflix on January 9.\n\nWhether you're already a fan of Henry or are just getting to know her work through the movie, \"People We Meet on Vacation\" will likely leave you wanting more. Here are other romance books that might help you fill the void.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is Henry's third summer romance book, and it's both an epic love story and an ode to books themselves.\n\nNora Stephens doesn't think anything is missing in her life. She loves her job as a literary agent, her apartment in New York, and living near her sister, Libby, and her nieces.\n\nWhen Libby asks Nora to escape to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina, for a month, Nora can't say no, especially since Libby is several months pregnant at the time. Libby has big dreams of small-town romance for Nora during their getaway, but instead of finding a local man to have a fling with, Nora keeps running into Charlie Lastra, a grumpy New York editor she's never gotten along with.\n\nDespite their less-than-romantic history, Charlie and Nora keep crossing paths in Sunshine Falls, making the ever-growing list of things they have in common harder to ignore. And when Nora discovers her life as she knows it is about to change, Charlie might be the exact thing she needs.\n\nHenry is at her best in \"Happy Place,\" a novel that ruminates on what it means to fight for love.\n\nHarriet has spent her entire adult life loving Wyn. Their relationship consumes her, and the fact that she met him through her best friends, Sabrina and Cleo, only makes her love him more. Between Wyn and her friends, Harriet found the family she had always wanted in college, and she plans to spend her entire life with them.\n\nWhen Wyn abruptly breaks up with her after she starts her medical school residency, Harriet is heartbroken and terrified she's going to lose everyone she loves. She manages to avoid telling Sabrina and Cleo what happened for five months, planning to burst their bubble on their annual group trip to Maine.\n\nThen, Harriet is shocked to see Wyn when she arrives, and he informs her that they'll have to pretend to be a couple for the duration of the trip, as it's the last vacation the group will ever spend in the house they've loved for years. Harriet doesn't want to cause her friends pain, so she's willing to torture herself for a week.\n\nAll she has to do is stop herself from asking Wyn what went wrong for seven days, but as his displays of fake affection start to feel more and more real, Harriet might have to face her fear of rocking the boat if she wants a true chance at happiness.\n\nHenry's latest book, \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" takes place in the summer and features a love story, but it marks a departure from her typical romances.\n\nJournalist Alice Scott is ready for the biggest challenge of her career to date: convincing the elusive heiress Margaret Ives to let her write her biography.\n\nSunny-dispositioned and thoughtful Alice is sure she can make Margaret comfortable enough to share the story of why she disappeared from public life years ago. However, when she arrives in Little Crescent Island, Georgia, to meet Margaret, she finds she'll be competing against Hayden Anderson, a grumpy and inconveniently handsome writer who happened to win a Pulitzer Prize for his last biography, to tell Margaret's story.\n\nBeating out Hayden for the role might be an uphill battle, but Alice isn't going down without a fight, even after she realizes Margaret is picking and choosing what she tells each of them after getting them to sign strict NDAs. And as they try to unweave Margaret's history, it will become more and more difficult for Alice and Hayden to ignore the heat between them.\n\nBolu Babalola's \"Honey & Spice\" doesn't feel like a debut novel, as she writes romantic chemistry with a deftness Henry herself may envy.\n\nKiki Banjo has made a name for herself at Whitewell University with her radio show \"Brown Sugar.\" She's staked her reputation on her ability to suss out players, warning her peers in the African-Caribbean Society against dating men who aren't worth their time.\n\nThen she risks it all by kissing Malakai Korede in front of everyone after writing him off as \"The Wastemen of Whitewell\" on her show. Kiki is terrified her show is going to slip through her grasp, so she makes a deal with Malakai to pretend to be a couple in the hopes that Kiki can save her show and Malakai can change his reputation on campus.\n\nKiki expects the duration of their fake romance to be torture, but as she and Malakai eat, study, and spend time together, she's unsettled to discover there seems to be more to him than meets the eye. Will Kiki be willing to let go of her preconceived notions for a chance at something real?\n\nLike Henry, Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master at writing about yearning and epic love, as is obvious in \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nMonique Grant's career as a magazine writer is at a standstill when famous — and famously private — film star Evelyn Hugo says she wants to do a tell-all interview with Monique, and only Monique.\n\nMonique doesn't understand why Evelyn would want to work with her of all people, but she can't say no, especially when Evelyn starts opening up to her about her path to fame and the forbidden love that changed the course of her life. Monique feels like Evelyn has handed her the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nWhen she finds out why Evelyn chose her for the tell-all, Monique will have to face truths about their shared history she never expected.\n\nIf you've already read Henry's \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" you'll swoon for \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nLydia Bird's life is turned upside down when the love of her life, Freddie, dies in a car accident. After months of mourning and wanting to go back in time, Lydia begins to move on with the help of her sister and Freddie's best friend.\n\nThen she's given a way to return to her old life with Freddie, a life where the tragedy never occurred. Her heart is pulled in two directions as she struggles to choose between going back to the familiar and embracing the unknown, where someone new wants to love her.\n\nPoignant and fresh, Josie Silver's \"The Two Lives of Lydia Bird\" is a story of love and hope that strikes a similar tone to Henry's works.\n\nOn the night before Drew Nichols is set to be a groomsman in his ex-girlfriend's wedding, he gets stuck in an elevator with the pretty and funny Alexa Monroe, the first bright spot in what he believes will be an unbearable weekend.\n\nImpulse leads him to ask her to be his date to the wedding, and the duo surprises themselves by having more fun together than they bargained for. They plan to part ways after the wedding, neither interested in a long-distance relationship, but fate might have other plans for them.\n\nJasmine Guillory writes about romance with reverence and joy, making \"The Wedding Date\" an ideal read for Henry lovers.\n\nDannie Kohan's plan is on track. In one day, she performs well at the job interview of a lifetime and agrees to marry her long-term boyfriend. Then, when she goes to sleep that night, she wakes up five years in the future, with a different man beside her and his ring on her finger.\n\nDannie only has one hour in the future before she's yanked back to the present, and she tries to push aside the experience as a vivid dream. Then, she meets the man from her dream four and a half years later and discovers he's dating her best friend. Dannie will have to confront what she really wants and find out if she's willing to change her plans to find true happiness.\n\nRebecca Serle's \"In Five Years\" explores time, grief, and all-consuming love, both romantic and platonic, in the same way Henry's books do, challenging the reader to ask themselves how far they would go for true happiness.\n\nAlthough Sally Rooney's beloved \"Normal People\" has a darker tone than Henry's books, the protagonists, Connell and Marianne, have a chemistry and a years-long history that Henry fans will love.\n\nConnell and Marianne meet in high school, when Connell is a popular jock, and Marianne is, well, the opposite. The two bond despite their differences, setting them on a course that will shape their lives, drawing them back to one another over and over again.\n\nRooney's novel shows the inevitability of love, finding words for the often inexplicable reasons people need each other. You can also stream the Hulu series once you finish the book.\n\nLike Henry, Carley Fortune captures the angst and ecstasy of summer love in \"One Golden Summer.\"\n\nAlice can trace back her successful photography career to one photo: a candid shot of three teenagers on a bright yellow speedboat. She captured the shot during the one summer she spent at Barry's Bay with her Nan when she was 17, and it shifted the trajectory of her life.\n\nFifteen years later, Alice should be living her dream as a professional photographer, but six months after a breakup, she feels stuck and uninspired. When Nan breaks her hip, Alice thinks spending another summer at Barry's Bay might be good for them both.\n\nHer vision of a tranquil summer with her grandmother gets upended by Charlie Florek, one of the teens from Alice's famous photo. The glimpse of Charlie that she got across the lake all those years ago was intriguing, but adult Charlie is so devastatingly handsome and thoughtful that he almost scares Alice.\n\nAs they spend the summer together, Charlie heals wounds in Alice that she didn't know were there. If he lets her in, Alice might just do the same for Charlie.\n\nIlya Rozanov and Shane Hollander are supposed to hate each other. Not only have they been competing against each other in hockey since they were 18, but they're also total opposites. Canadian Shane is cautious and focused, while Russian wildcard Ilya isn't afraid to embrace his bad boy reputation on the ice.\n\nThey have one big thing in common, though: the secret hookups they can't seem to resist every time they see each other. If the world found out about their relationship, both Ilya and Shane's careers could be in jeopardy, but they may decide it's worth the risk for a chance at something real with each other.\n\nLike Henry's \"PWMOV,\" Rachel Reid's \"Heated Rivalry\" got adapted, though into a hit TV show instead of a movie, so you can stream the series if you want more from the characters when you finish the book.\n\nChristina Lauren has written dozens of books, but their 2018 novel \"Love & Other Words\" is perfect for fans of \"People We Meet on Vacation\" because of its dual timeline.\n\nMacy Sorensen has been white-knuckling her way through life for nearly a decade, but she's content with the safe world she's constructed for herself. A pediatric resident and newly engaged to a kind man who makes her feel mostly nothing, Macy thinks her heart is safe from the turmoil she experienced in her adolescence — until Elliot Petropoulos literally walks back into her life.\n\nMacy met Elliot as a teen shortly after her mother died, and he quickly became her center of gravity as she visited the small town he called home on weekends. Christina Lauren tells their story from the past and present, showing readers how they became fast friends over books and adolescent secrets, how they fell into life-changing love, and the wreckage they were both left with when it all fell apart.\n\nAfter 10 years of no contact, Macy may finally be ready to tell Elliot why she went radio silent on him after one fateful night. They'll both have to decide if they can move on from the pain of the past for a chance at a joy-filled future, together.\n\nAchingly romantic and surprisingly funny, \"The Seven Year Slip\" by Ashley Poston is about meeting the right person at the wrong time, literally.\n\nClementine West has been adrift since her beloved aunt died. She thought living in the Upper East Side apartment she inherited from her would make her feel closer to her, as the apartment's magic had always drawn her in. Instead, she feels like she's just waiting for her aunt to walk through the door.\n\nThen, Clementine comes home one day to a man she doesn't know standing in her kitchen. Except, he thinks the apartment is his, for the summer anyway. He exists seven years in the past, staying in the apartment over the summer while Clementine and her aunt were in Europe.\n\nClementine isn't ready to be hurt by love again, but she might not be able to keep up her defenses against the sweet chef staying the summer. And if she does let herself fall, will they work together if she finds him again in the now?\n\nJustin and Emma are having the same dating problem. Everyone they date meets their soulmate immediately after they break up with them.\n\nWhen Emma sees Justin's viral Reddit post about his problem, she reaches out, and they decide to go on a date with each other in the hopes of breaking their curse.\n\nEmma, a traveling nurse, plans to stay in Minnesota for the summer and enjoy a fling with Justin during her short stay. The last thing either expects is to get immediately attached, especially when they both have family members counting on them come fall.\n\nDespite their best-laid plans, Emma and Justin's curse might have been leading them to each other all along in \"Just for the Summer\" by Abby Jimenez.\n\nTo the world, romance novelist Eva Mercy and acclaimed literary author Shane Hall have nothing to do with each other. That's because the only two people who know their books are inspired by each other are Eva and Shane.\n\nFor their entire careers, Shane and Eva have been writing secret love letters to each other, as the week they spent as teens glued to each other's sides in a rush of love still haunts them both years later.\n\nThey finally come face-to-face again when they both speak on a Brooklyn literary panel, and despite the years since they've seen each other, their chemistry is undeniable. Eva doesn't trust Shane after the way things went down between them, though, and as a single mom, she can't risk getting hurt again.\n\nStill, Eva has always been curious to know why Shane disappeared, and reuniting with him might be the key to breaking her writer's block.\n\nThe second-chance romance in Tia Williams' \"Seven Days in June\" will hit the spot for Henry's fans.\n\nOf Ali Hazelwood's nine romance novels, the coming-of-age story and yearning in \"Deep End\" are most similar to the themes of \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"\n\nNearly every moment of Scarlett Vandermeer's life at Stanford is accounted for. She spends her days in the pool as a member of the diving team or studying, laser-focused on achieving her goal of getting into medical school.\n\nA relationship or even a fling is the last thing on Scarlett's mind. Then, she finds out Lukas Blomqvist, Stanford's world champion swim captain who thrives on control, has similar interests to her when it comes to intimacy, and she thinks she might be able to make time in her busy schedule for something casual.\n\nLukas and Scarlett agree to explore their attraction together, deciding not to tell almost anyone about their arrangement. Scarlett doesn't think keeping her relationship with Lukas to herself will be a problem until she realizes the last thing she feels about him is casual.\n\n\"Same Time Next Summer\" by Annabel Monaghan offers another take on second-chance romance.\n\nSam's family's beach house on Long Island was her happy place in her childhood. She spent every summer there, and she was never happier than she was with her toes in the sand. Then, at 17, Wyatt broke her heart, and Sam couldn't face a summer there without him. She hasn't been back for more than a long weekend since.\n\nAt 30, Sam is making the trek from the city back to the beach, and she isn't the girl she was at 17. She's determined to succeed at her high-powered job and plan the perfect wedding with her fiancé, Jack, whose tendency to over-schedule their lives has become a comfort.\n\nOnly when she arrives, Sam discovers that Wyatt has returned to the house next door, and the entire adult life she created for herself begins to crumble. As old feelings come rushing back, Sam will have to take stock of who she is, who she wants to be, and who she really wants to live her life with.\n\nWhen Phoebe Stone arrives at the Cornwall Inn in Rhode Island, she's dressed to the nines and doesn't intend to ever check out. Her plans immediately go awry, though, when she discovers the entire hotel has been rented out for a wedding, and the attendees immediately assume she's one of the wedding people.\n\nSoon, Phoebe has no choice but to participate in the wedding festivities, especially because she and the bride keep telling each other their darkest secrets.\n\nAfter months of depression, the fanfare and plot twist of a stranger's wedding might just show Phoebe her own path forward.\n\nSlightly more melancholy in tone than Henry's works but still beautifully romantic, \"The Wedding People\" by Alison Espach is about the surprises life can bring when you least expect it.",

    "fullText": "Thanks to AI, everyone will be able to code. But a staff engineer at Netflix said that he tells recent grads that doesn't mean their job prospects are hopeless.\n\n\"We're going to see some amazing things, but our hunger for more functionality, more apps, more ecosystems is just gonna get higher, and higher, and higher,\" Anthony Goto said in a recent TikTok video. \"So, in the end, I think this is gonna be another, essentially, level of programming language, a high-level programming language.\"\n\nNew grads ask me all the time if AI means software engineers are done. Especially those preparing for Netflix interviews. This fear has happened before. AI is another layer of abstraction, not the end of engineering. #Netflix #NetflixInterview #SoftwareEngineer #TechCareers #AI\n\nGoto, who has 15 years of experience his time at Netflix and Uber alone, said that AI-related worries are among the top concerns he hears when he talks with recent graduates or employees he's mentoring.\n\nAnd to be fair, there is no shortage of takes about the future value of computer science degrees and the overall worth of coding knowledge, given the rapid advancements of agentic AI tools like Anthropic's Claude, which has led to \"vibe coding.\"\n\nOne way to stay competitive, Goto said, is for newer engineers to make sure they learn System Design.\n\n\"System Design is exactly what I am trying to ensure newer engineers get a handle on,\" he said. \"In the future, we may likely end up wielding system design like a tool.\"\n\nGoto points to the video game industry as an example of what's to come. Rapid advancements since the introduction of Doom in 1993 have spawned an industry that rakes in over $100 billion and regularly draws on Hollywood talent for its biggest releases.\n\n\"Picture someone from the year 2000, 2010, they go back in time, they go to John Carmack, and they say, 'Guess what? In the future, we're gonna have these things called video game engines,\" Goto said.\n\nLast year, Carmack, a video game legend who was the lead programmer of Doom, said that software progress has made some of the early grunt work he did \"as irrelevant as chariot wheel maintenance.\"\n\n\"Game engines have radically expanded the range of people involved in game dev, even as they deemphasized the importance of much of my beloved system engineering,\" Carmack wrote on X in April 2025.\n\nGame engines are now so powerful that they are used to create immersive digital sets and environments, such as those featured in Disney's hit series \"The Mandalorian.\"\n\nGoto admits that his prediction could very well be inaccurate, but based on the trajectory of past technological advancements, he sees a clear need for engineers.\n\n\"We've seen this many times before, where we abstract things away in a really powerful way,\" he said. \"And what it really does is democratizes the process.\"",

    "title": "Podcasts face a major test in 2026: Can they make it big on TV screens?",
    "description": "YouTube leads in podcast streaming while Netflix plans to launch 33-plus podcasts in 2026. Can video pods become the new TV?",
    "fullText": "Podcasts are increasingly making the leap to TV — and 2026 will be a significant test of the format's potential in the living room.\n\nYouTube, already the top streaming TV service, has solidified its position as the No. 1 destination for podcasts, too. Forty percent of monthly listeners called it their most-used service, trouncing Spotify (18%) and Apple (11%), according to a June 2025 survey by Sounds Profitable and Signal Hill Insights.\n\nNetflix is now looking to challenge YouTube with a slate of video podcasts set to roll out early this year. The streamer has at least 33 shows already in hand and has struck deals for the likes of Bill Simmons, Charlamagne Tha God's \"The Breakfast Club,\" and several Barstool Sports offerings. Netflix has told potential partners it wants to have 50 to 75 shows at launch.\n\nFox also made a significant investment in 2025 in podcasts. It acquired Red Seat Ventures, which handles production and ad sales for conservative hosts including Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Bill O'Reilly. It also signed a deal that brings \"Crime Junkie\" parent Audiochuck's shows to its free streamer, Tubi.\n\nAll this is encouraging to podcast insiders who love the prospect of seeing some competition for YouTube and more money flowing into the space. YouTube's ascent spurred many audio hosts to create video versions of their shows and also drew more influencers to the format.\n\n\"We're essentially an influencer medium,\" Greg Glenday, the CEO of leading podcast company Acast, told Business Insider. Acast has been looking to position its hosts as creators to broaden their appeal to advertisers.\n\nResearch shows that the definition of a podcast has expanded. A quarter of people polled by the Sounds Profitable survey said they thought of podcasts as either audio or video, up from 21% in 2024.\n\n\"What began as an audio-only medium has become a visual-first content format, essentially the modern-day counterpart to certain types of television programming that can also live in audio,\" Michael Calvin Jones, SVP of Wasserman Creators, recently told Business Insider.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how successfully podcasts can make the transition to TV. Will they truly become the next generation's version of a TV talk show? Some industry insiders think the potential for podcasts, which often consist of one or two people talking in a studio, to become a premium visual offering could be overstated.\n\nEven YouTube's rise could be, in some respects, misleading. Sounds Profitable's survey found that a lot of people still use YouTube to listen to podcasts as well as watch them.\n\n\"The numbers are saying more and more are watching podcasts on YouTube, but it doesn't mean they're actually watching them,\" said Adam McNeil, a podcast ad buyer at Adopter Media. \"YouTube is important for discoverability, but is it still very much an audio-based medium? I would say it is.\"\n\nWhether video podcasts can grow the podcast listening pie, or, in the case of Netflix, juice engagement or subscribers, is also still TBD. In the case of Bill Simmons, Netflix is presenting his sports talk show live on Sundays starting January 11, giving it a shot at being appointment viewing.\n\n\"They're not an acquisition lever like tentpole originals, breakout viral hits, or live sports,\" said Nick Cicero, founder of measurement company Mondo Metrics. Video podcasts could get people to increase their time and frequency on the service, help retain them as subscribers, and serve niche audiences, he said.\n\nNetflix's approach is also a gamble for the hosts. The streamer is getting hosts to pull their video shows off YouTube in its quest for exclusivity. But top independent creators often want to distribute their shows as widely as possible and value the real-time performance data and fan interactivity they get on YouTube.\n\nPodcasts have largely been a free, widely distributed medium, and being paywalled and exclusive to one platform has been the exception rather than the rule. Spotify tried to sew up top podcaster Joe Rogan and others, but moved away from exclusives after four years to maximize their distribution and ad sales.\n\nBeing on Netflix could expose hosts to a whole new set of viewers, but some industry insiders wonder if taking the shows off YouTube could mean losing fans who aren't motivated enough to seek them out on a new platform.\n\n\"I think it's a huge risk,\" McNeil said.",

    "fullText": "From Stanley Tucci’s imperious tech titan to Lex Luthor’s distractingly hot CEO and Elon Musk-esque blowhards, films this year took us inside the billionaire mindset\n\nBetween the slash-and-burn US government reboot led by a dank meme fan and the relentless pushing of AI by venture capital-backed blowhards, 2025 has felt like peak obnoxious tech bro. Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.\n\nWith such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto on The Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”\n\nThere was more baldness in Superman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage about perceived wokeness added a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.\n\nIs it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thriller M3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.\n\nIf Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr in The Naked Gun reboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.\n\nIn the goopy, grungy world of The Toxic Avenger reboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such as Bryan Johnson.\n\nIn 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulish Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby in Tron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully from the original 1982 Tron – seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.\n\nBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satire Mountainhead took the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.\n\nAs Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible.

    "description": "Free streamers like YouTube have gained viewers, while growth at paid services like Disney+ and Netflix has slowed.",
    "fullText": "Free streaming services are having success, and it may be coming at the expense of their paid peers.\n\nYouTube and other free ad-supported services, such as The Roku Channel and Fox-owned Tubi, have become increasingly popular over the last two years, according to Nielsen's viewership data.\n\n\"For consumers, cost sensitivity is often a more important deciding factor than user experience,\" said Brandon Katz, a media analyst at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. \"Saving money outweighs the annoyance of terrible insurance commercials.\"\n\nAs these free streamers eat up a larger chunk of viewership time on US smart TVs, they may be holding back the growth of services like Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max.\n\nFree-to-access services YouTube, Tubi, and The Roku Channel have grown their viewership by 53% from December 2023 through November, according to a Business Insider analysis of Nielsen data. Those three free streamers make up nearly 18% of all watch time on US TVs, and that doesn't include Paramount's Pluto TV, which Nielsen broke out individually until March.\n\nIn that span, major paid streamers' collective watch time is only up 5%. That includes Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, and HBO Max, formerly known as Max. (Paramount+ was included until March, when Nielsen stopped reporting its individual share. And HBO Max's viewership includes sister streamer Discovery+.)\n\nThat means free streamers are growing more than 10 times faster than their paid counterparts, though the bulk of that growth is driven by YouTube, which has become a force in Hollywood.\n\nSlower engagement growth is a troubling sign for paid streamers. Viewership is positively tied to pricing power and inversely correlated with cancellations, meaning that people who watch a streamer more often are less likely to cancel.\n\n\"Engagement drives churn down,\" said Hernan Lopez, founder of media consulting firm Owl & Co.\n\n\"It's not just about hours spent,\" he added, but also the frequency that viewers return to an app and the breadth of content that they watch.\n\nEngaged streaming subscribers are also usually more receptive to price hikes, Katz said, since they likely place a higher value on the service than inactive users.\n\n\"The goal is to offer customers enough attractive content that opening the app becomes a regular occurrence,\" Katz said. \"At that habitual usage point, streamers are able to reasonably raise prices without fear of a mass exodus of customers.\"\n\nFor customers on ad-supported plans, higher engagement also translates to more ad revenue.\n\nIt's not all bad news for paid streamers. Streaming is an increasingly profitable business, thanks in large part to price hikes, which every major service (except for Prime Video) has implemented or announced in the past 12 months.\n\nDisney+, Hulu, and HBO Max have also continued to add customers this year. However, Peacock hasn't grown its subscriber base since the first quarter of 2025, and Netflix no longer reports its subscriber count on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe large gap between free and paid streamer viewership growth rates suggests that so-called stream-flation could be taking a toll. Media giants must walk a tightrope between pleasing Wall Street and pushing consumers toward free streamers, or apps like Instagram and TikTok.\n\nStreaming giants Netflix and Disney each have creative ideas for driving engagement in 2026.\n\nNetflix is turning to video podcasts in hopes of adding lean-back content that keeps subscribers engaged throughout the day. It's also been trying to use games as a way to create daily habits among its users.\n\nDisney is taking a different tack by betting on AI-generated video through a new partnership with OpenAI. This AI initiative will enable fans to create short clips of Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse or Darth Vader, eventually within the Disney+ app.",

    "description": "Remote work policies are changing at many large companies, including NBCUniversal and Paramount. Here's which media giants still allow remote work.",
    "fullText": "It was a year of RTO mandates in the media industry.\n\nThose issuing new guidance included media giants like NBCUniversal and Paramount Skydance, which this fall told thousands of employees to prepare to work in person four or five days a week in early 2026.\n\nWork-from-home policies haven't gone extinct at Netflix or its acquisition target, Warner Bros. Discovery, however. YouTube also has a flexible approach to remote work.\n\nHere's the latest on work-from-home and return-to-office policies at six major media and tech companies heading into 2026.\n\nParamount announced this year that it would be calling thousands of employees back to its New York and Los Angeles offices to work in-person five days a week starting January 5, 2026. The decision came in early September, less than a month after CEO David Ellison took charge after the Paramount-Skydance merger.\n\nStaffers who weren't up for in-person work were offered a severance package, which about 600 employees took, Paramount said in its third-quarter shareholder letter in mid-November.\n\nSome Paramount staff members can continue to work from home for now, including those based outside the US and those who were hired for fully remote roles. These employees who aren't assigned to the NY or LA offices will hear about \"Phase Two\" of Paramount's return-to-office plan in 2026, Ellison told employees in his September memo.\n\nParamount has been preparing its offices in NY and LA for an influx of remote workers by having employees in those areas work from home throughout December.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal followed in Paramount's footsteps, telling employees to report to its office four days per week starting January 5, 2026. NBCU staffers can still work from home on Fridays.\n\n\"In-person work and collaboration spark innovation, promote creativity, and build stronger connections,\" NBCU operating chief Adam Miller said in a memo to staffers about the change.\n\nNBCU also gave a severance offer to employees who weren't willing to return to the office. Notably, this exit package was one-size-fits-all, meaning that it wasn't dependent on how long staffers had worked for the parent of Peacock and Universal Studios.\n\nDisney's return-to-office edict came nearly three years ago in early 2023, when CEO Bob Iger called most Mouse House staffers back to the office four days a week.\n\n\"It is my belief that working together more in-person will benefit the company's creativity, culture, and our employees' careers,\" Iger told employees at the time.\n\nHowever, Disney's remote work policy isn't always enforced equally. Some staffers have told Business Insider that their managers strictly enforce the four-day rule, while others have said that their bosses are more lax about badge swipes.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery requires most of its employees to work in person three days a week, with a work-from-home option on the other two days.\n\nHowever, that policy could change if the company behind HBO and Warner Bros. Studios were bought by either Netflix or Paramount Skydance.\n\nYouTube-parent Google's remote work policy may be confusing, but it offers a certain level of flexibility.\n\nThe tech giant's remote work policy lets employees work from home two days a week. It also offers a \"Work From Anywhere\" program, allowing staff members to telecommute for four weeks a year.\n\nGoogle revised that \"Work From Anywhere\" policy this fall, CNBC reported, citing an internal memo telling employees that using one so-called \"WFA\" day in a week would count as using an entire week. That's because these \"WFA\" weeks are intended for use when employees work away from their homes or worksites, and not as a substitute for a work-from-home or paid-time-off day.\n\n\"The policy was always intended to be taken in increments of a week and not be used as a substitute for working from home in a regular hybrid workweek,\" John Casey, Google's VP of performance and rewards, said of the change in a call with employees, CNBC reported.\n\nNetflix hasn't set a companywide work-site policy, meaning that employees can be fully remote, work in the office every day, or anywhere in between.\n\nEmployees' working locations can vary by team and position, which a Netflix spokesperson said gives teams \"the information and freedom to make decisions that best suit their type of work.\"\n\nThat relaxed remote work policy has long been common among tech companies, though that's starting to shift — even at video-conference giant Zoom.",

Obviously, many people will be watching on Netflix. Every single time you see one of those guys run on the field with the orange gloves and say, TV timeout, or the players get a breather, they'll throw it back to the studio,\" said Long, \"Scott and I will be covering all the happenings from that drive, looking ahead, all the storylines you could think of. Obviously, as people watch, they will try to interact. We'll have multiple opportunities to engage in back-and-forth with people around the world.

I believe this aligns with the 'MO' (Main Objective) in Detroit. We've got to earn it. We've got to scratch and claw.\"\n\nKansas City notably defeated Detroit earlier this season in Week 6 at Arrowhead Stadium, while the Vikings will play spoiler as hosts of the second game of the doubleheader.\n\n\"The Minnesota Vikings. I mean, I don't know if you're on social media, but there's been a lot of memes about the Minnesota Vikings, particularly their young quarterback, and what I've seen is that the defense has rallied around this guy. \"The protectors on the offensive side rally around this guy,\" said Long. \"You take a look around the NFC North, and the Bears and the Packers are the two teams most likely to make the playoffs. These two teams are fighting for respect, and they know that next year starts now, especially for a guy like J.J. McCarthy. We know how good their coach is. We know about their defense, but the one big question mark is that quarterback.

    "description": "Amazon, YouTube TV, and Netflix dominate US sports streaming, accounting for 65% of the $6.5 billion spent by streamers on sports rights.",
    "fullText": "The NFL is giving sports fans a triple header for Christmas this year, starting with the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, plus a Snoop Dogg halftime performance. But you have to \n\nThe tech giants have eaten the entertainment world, and now they're coming for sports.\n\nTogether, Amazon and YouTube TV account for 65% of the $6.5 billion that streamers will spend on sports rights for US audiences in 2025 (34.4% and 30.6%, respectively), according to Ampere Analysis. The third biggest share went to Netflix, with 11.3%. Disney's ESPN+ and Comcast's Peacock held a distant fourth and fifth place.\n\nAmazon and YouTube have actively pursued significant deals for sports rights in recent years, with Amazon paying $11 billion for the NFL's Thursday Night Football and $19.8 billion for NBA rights, and YouTube paying $14 billion to secure NFL \"Sunday Ticket\" rights.\n\nNetflix has also been active, scooping up NFL Christmas Day games and the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, although it prefers to treat sports as part of a broader live events strategy that includes comedy specials and awards shows rather than \"renting\" full seasons of sports rights. A person familiar with Netflix's spending said they pegged it at about $600 million versus Ampere's calculation of $738 million.\n\nAmpere's data comes with a few caveats. Its measurements of eight platforms exclude spending for rights distributed internationally — such as Amazon's spending on NFL rights outside the US, or on the UEFA Men's Champions League within the UK — and for DAZN's acquisition of the global FIFA Club World Cup 2025 rights for $1 billion.\n\nBroadcasters remain the largest buyers of sports rights in the US, although streamers are making inroads.\n\nNearly half (47%) of US broadcasters' content spending — $24 billion — went to sports rights in 2025, per Ampere. Most of US streamers' content budgets still go to TV shows and films. This year, 10% of their content budgets overall went to sports in 2025, up from 6% in 2024. Even for Amazon, sports were about 19% of its spending on content, approaching the amount it spends on movies.\n\nSports can help streamers grow engagement and keep audiences subscribed. However, the rising cost of sports means less money for an already stagnating entertainment TV ecosystem that has been producing fewer shows since the end of Peak TV in 2022.\n\nDisney said in its fourth quarter earnings call that it would spend $24 billion in the next fiscal year, driven in large part by sports rights. CFO Hugh Johnston justified paying a more than 73% step up for NBA rights in its 2024 deal by pointing to their value to audiences and advertisers, despite the cost creating \"a little bit of bumpiness during the course of the year.\"\n\nNetflix compared its recent NFL deal to the cost of its movies, which it's been making fewer of. Asked about the cost of the deal at an investor conference last year, Netflix exec Spencer Wang said he would characterize each game as \"roughly the size of one of our medium-sized original films.\"\n\nThe shift of sports to streaming platforms looks likely to continue.\n\nAmpere forecasts global spending on sports rights to increase by 20% to $78 billion worldwide by 2030. Spending will be driven by the US, where new NBA and MLB rights will be up for grabs in the coming years. Talks for the next round of NFL negotiations could start as early as 2026, as the league seeks to maximize the value of its media rights.\n\nYouTube TV is also expanding its play for sports fans, announcing a new sports bundle along with other niche packages that cost less than its regular $83-per-month service.",

    "title": "Billionaire Larry Ellison comes to his son’s rescue, agreeing to personally guarantee over $40 billion to finance Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros.",
    "description": "Warner Bros. is in the middle of a tug-of-war between Netflix and David Ellison’s company, Paramount Skydance.",
    "fullText": "Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is raising the stakes in the battle for Hollywood’s future, personally intervening to salvage his son David Ellison’s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. On Monday, David’s company, Paramount Skydance, announced the elder Ellison had provided an “irrevocable personal guarantee” of $40.4 billion to finance the deal, directly countering claims that the company’s funding was unreliable.​\n\nIt’s the latest turn in the high-profile tug-of-war for Warner Bros. Discovery, one of the entertainment industry’s crown jewels. David Ellison, who became CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance in August, has been aggressively pursuing Warner Bros. with a $108 billion all-cash offer, which comes out to about $30 per share. However, WBD’s board rejected that proposal in favor of a rival agreement to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix for roughly $83 billion.​\n\nThe board’s rejection hinged largely on skepticism regarding the Ellison family’s financing. Last week, WBD directors dismissed Paramount’s funding as “illusory,” citing concerns that the capital was tied to a “revocable family trust” that could be altered or withdrawn before the deal closed. Larry Ellison’s Monday filing was designed to silence those doubts.\n\n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” the company said in a statement, adding that the tech tycoon has agreed “not to revoke the Ellison family trust (which has been operating for nearly 40 years as a counterparty to numerous transactions) or adversely transfer its assets during the pendency of the transaction.”​\n\nThis massive personal commitment—roughly one-sixth of Larry Ellison’s $247.3 billion estimated net worth—effectively removes the WBD board’s primary defense against the takeover. To further sweeten the pot, Paramount raised its proposed breakup fee to $5.8 billion, matching the termination fee included in the rival Netflix offer.​\n\nDavid Ellison argued that his company’s bid remains the only path that preserves Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole entity, rather than selling it off in parts. Netflix’s planned acquisition would exclude WBD’s Global Networks division, which includes CNN and other cable-native brands, and which WBD had previously announced plans to spin off.\n\n“Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on Dec. 4th, and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,” David Ellison said in a statement Monday. “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”​",

He will be in attendance for the Detroit Lions at the Minnesota Vikings, providing insight on the NFC North rivals.\n\n\"Well, my hope at that point is that the Bears have locked up a spot in the playoffs, and I don't have to stress. However, they have a hell of a schedule coming up. They got Green Bay and San Francisco, then finished with Detroit,\" said Rollins, \"So for one night only, I will be a Minnesota Vikings fan. Don't tell anybody from Detroit. But yeah, I'm going to be rooting for the Vikings. I'm probably going to need them to take the Lions down a peg so that the Bears can lock in and get it done. But yeah, it should be a fun game.\"\n\nThe streaming service returns on Christmas Day with another NFL global doubleheader, following the Kansas City Chiefs' victory in last year's first-ever broadcast over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nGet ready for some action-packed Christmas magic 🎄 \n\nDallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders at 1 PM ET \nDetroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings at 4:30 PM ET \n\nLIVE on Netflix December 25 pic.twitter.com/pVUKmqtrCM\n\n— Netflix Sports (@netflixsports) December 3, 2025\n\nThe Vikings will rely on 2024 first-round draft pick J.J. McCarthy, who has been inconsistent due to injuries, while the Lions try to regain the dominant form that propelled them last season.\n\n\"Curious to see the progression of J.J. McCarthy and what he looks like in Kevin O'Connell's offense as he goes through sort of what his rookie year is. Obviously, he missed last season with the injury, but it's kind of his first go-around,\" said Rollins, \"Which Lions are we going to get? Lions from last year that dominated and maybe made an early playoff exit, or are we going to get a Lions team that misses the playoffs this season? It's going to be very interesting to see. Looking forward to the matchup, and yeah, I will be saying 'Skol' all afternoon.\"\n\nNetflix's inaugural NFL Christmas games in 2024 smashed streaming records, with the Chiefs vs. Steelers game averaging over 24 million U.S. viewers and reaching nearly 65 million unique viewers across the doubleheader, making it the most-streamed NFL games ever on the platform.\n\nRollins will star in WWE Unreal Season 2, premiering on January 20, 2026: https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-unreal-season-2-release-date-trailer-news.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: WWE Superstar Seth Rollins discusses Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

    "fullText": "Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua script, explained: Why boxing fans think 2025 Netflix fight was staged originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAnthony Joshua and Jake Paul duked it out on Netflix on Friday night.\n\nJoshua filled in for Gervonta Davis, who was initially booked to take on Paul. The fight was easy to market, with Joshua having legitimate boxing experience while Paul is better known for his social media presence.\n\nJoshua weighed in about 30 pounds heavier than Paul, and the two would usually be in different weight classes. The fact that they were even boxing was already suspect, and many, including every single person on the pre-fight panel, thought the fight would be over before the end of the third round.\n\nPaul danced around the ring for a couple of rounds and continually went to his knees, almost like he was going to go for a UFC-style takedown. The fight went into the sixth round, and many lost interest in how long it was taking Joshua to win and the product being shown.\n\nJoshua finally put Paul away in the sixth round, but that didn't stop fans from calling into question the legitimacy of the fight.\n\nHere is more on how the highly anticipated boxing match between Joshua and Paul ended.\n\nMORE: How did Sporting News score the Jake Paul-Anthony Joshua fight?\n\nThe public will likely never know for certain whether the fight between Joshua and Paul was staged. The recent trend in boxing has seen many social media stars and former boxers putting on outrageous fights, and the outcomes of some of them certainly make it look like foul play is involved.\n\nPaul planned to run away from Joshua and hoped to land a knockout blow. As he ran away from Joshua and repeatedly fell to his knees, many on social media not only called into question the legitimacy of the fight, but also quickly called it one of the worst in recent memory.\n\nJoshua said he knew he needed to take some time to wear down Paul, but once he didn't knock out his opponent in the first or second round, the internet determined the fight must be scripted.\n\nMORE: Which celebrities attended the Jake Paul-Anthony Joshua fight?\n\nThe exact number hasn't been confirmed. Reports ahead of the fight suggested that Joshua and Paul would get paid $184 million, making $92 million apiece.\n\nPaul took to his Twitter account and wrote, \"Stop asking me. $267 million.\" While he never expanded on the message, many assumed that this would mean that the total purse was actually $267 million, with each fighter presumably taking home $133 million each.\n\nJake Paul for no reason #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/OkUwtE1CBG\n\n— Ron (@Ronhotspur) December 20, 2025\n\n“THE FANS DIDN’T PAY TO SEE THIS CRAP.”\n\nSays the official of the match. #Jakejoshua\n\npic.twitter.com/ceypDh9djg\n\n— Lavish Sports (@LAVISHSPORTSORG) December 20, 2025\n\nMe after betting Joshua to win by KO in round 1 (he threw 1 punch total) pic.twitter.com/w9RzVvqRtT\n\n— br_betting (@br_betting) December 20, 2025\n\nJake Paul took Anthony Joshua down 😂pic.twitter.com/dgZlAD4dKg\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) December 20, 2025\n\nJake Paul doing something *slightly* decent, followed by one of these#JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/aRKxZWafnL\n\n— Alex Wallace (@AlexWTalks) December 20, 2025\n\nAnthony Joshua not knocking out Jake Paul in the first round gave it away that this was scripted #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/j5C5DBai8B\n\n— SWB 🌟 (@29xSWB) December 20, 2025\n\nJake Paul keeps rolling around on the ground like that australian breakdancer #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/ptAPOMbylu\n\n— ♡ｌａｕｒｅｎ ♡ (@laurennfarmerr) December 20, 2025\n\nSo Jake Paul sticking his tongue out was the sign for Anthony Joshua to end the fight?

As you'd expect, some of these are proving to be quite popular ahead of Season Five's conclusion. We've seen several of the games and puzzles linked below go in and out of stock--so if one of your favorites is gone, be sure to check back for restocks. Stranger Things Season Five's second batch of episodes hit Netflix on December 25, followed by the series finale on December 31.\n\nUp to six players can enjoy this cooperative game, as they comb through dozens of documents and investigate the bizarre happenings around the town of Hawkins. You'll need internet access for some of its puzzles--allowing you to access various files and even an old Walkman--though even folks unfamiliar with the series can help unravel this strange mystery.\n\nYour standard deck of cards gets a Stranger Things makeover with this fun set. The officially licensed set also comes with a collectible store tin, giving you a cool place to stash your cards when they're not in use.\n\nAnother set of playing cards, this time with a higher quality finish and more premium materials. Featuring holographic red and silver foils, these high-end cards are a nice alternative to the gift set above.\n\nTop Trumps is a simple card game that has you battling to collect all the cards in the deck. This rendition gets you cards featuring iconic characters from the show, including Eleven, Hopper, Mike, and even the Mind Flayer.\n\nThink you're a Stranger Things expert? Test yourself with this quiz, featuring 500 questions and a nifty storage container.\n\nPick up some Top Trumps cards along with a unique collector's tin. The tin is the big selling point here--featuring a Hawkins High School design, it's a cool bit of memorabilia for your home theater.\n\nSave Hawkins from a series of supernatural threats in this cooperative board game. It features events from the first two seasons, comes with 11 miniatures (including the Demogorgon and Eleven), and each match runs for about an hour.\n\nThe Mind Flayer is taking over Hawkins, and it's unclear who is under its control. This bluffing game sees \"Sane\" characters battling against \"Possessed\" characters, but the other players don't know which team you belong to. That means you'll have to bluff your way to success, while trying to determine who you can trust along the way.\n\nPlay through the last campaign of Eddie Munson. You'll get to go on four adventures that have you fighting Demogorgons and Demodogs, and the set includes everything you need to get started--such as retro cards, character sheets, dice, and a DM's screen.\n\nPut together a stylized image of a Demogorgon tangled in festive holiday lights. The finished puzzle is 21.25 x 15 inches, and you'll get a full-color poster as a bonus.\n\nLooking for a big project to work on? Check out this colorful 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, which features Eleven as part of the Nina Project. The completed puzzle is 26.75 x 19.75 inches, and you'll get a reference poster to help you along the way.\n\nPut together an iconic scene of the Stranger Things kids as they bike through the eerie streets of Hawkins. It's a big undertaking at 1,000 pieces, though no doubt it's one of the coolest designs up for grabs. Includes a reference poster and the finished project clocks in at 26.75 x 19.75 inches.\n\nPut together a cool panorama of various Stranger Things scenes. The main cast is shown off across the seasons here, making it a fun way to commemorate the finale on New Year's Eve.\n\nFeaturing a unique black, white, and red design, this 1,000-piece puzzle looks much different than the ones above. It adapts the artwork from the premium playing cards into a puzzle, though it keeps some of the holographic elements for a truly eye-catching design.\n\nWe're not sure if it'll allow you to communicate with the Upside Down, but you can definitely use it to build some cool, colorful designs. This version includes templates inspired by the show, such as the Hellfire Club Demon, Demodog, and Eddie's Guitar.",

He is returning to the ring after a knockout loss to Daniel Dubois last year and subsequent elbow surgery. Despite the layoff, Joshua enters the fight as the significant betting favorite, looking to quickly dispatch the controversial star and prove he is still an elite contender.\n\nPaul (12-1, 7 KOs) is taking the most significant risk of his boxing career, moving up to heavyweight to face his first legitimate, active, and credentialed professional boxer.

    "fullText": "Netflix has signed ESPN’s Elle Duncan as its first sports anchor. As part of her multiyear deal, she will lead on-air coverage for Netflix Sports across the streamer’s diverse portfolio of growing sports coverage.\n\nHer first on-air hosting gig will be in early 2026 with “Skyscraper Live,” where free solo climber Alex Honnold will attempt to scale Taipei 101, the tallest building in Taiwan.\n\n“Joining Netflix feels like being invited to an already legendary party and somehow getting handed the aux cord!” Duncan said. “For a lifelong utility player, a multisport assignment is a full-circle moment, and being trusted with something this one-of-a-kind feels incredibly special and surreal. I’m bringing boundless energy, storytelling and bad puns no one asked for but will be subjected to anyway.”\n\n“Also, I was told this fast-tracks my kids to meeting the KPop Demon Hunters, so … win-win,” she added.\n\nDuncan comes from ESPN, known for her work on “SportsCenter,” “College GameDay” and “WNBA Countdown.” She specifically covered college and professional basketball, hosting “College GameDay” for women’s basketball across the country.\n\nNetflix has expanded its sports portfolio signing deals with the NFL, MLB, the Women’s World Cup, WWE, FIFA and more, so Duncan’s coverage slate will be diverse.\n\n“Elle Duncan’s proven ability to seamlessly move between hard-hitting sports analysis and warm, personality-driven cultural hosting makes her a perfect fit at Netflix,” Gabe Spitzer, vice president of sports at Netflix, said. “She immediately adds credibility and familiar star power to our global programming slate.”\n\nThe television host started her career in Atlanta, as an anchor for NESN and spending six years as an Atlanta Hawks sideline reporter. She joined ESPN in 2016, where she hosted the 6 p.m. ET edition of “SportsCenter” and held key roles across college and professional basketball. Her final “SportsCenter” appearance was Tuesday.\n\nThe post Netflix Taps ESPN’s Elle Duncan as First Sports Anchor in Multiyear Deal appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI (AP) — Jake Paul proudly boasts he has become the face of boxing during the past decade. Now the YouTuber-turned-fighter is ready to embark on his riskiest ring venture yet after 13 professional fights featuring a cross section of opponents that lack the active status and talent of his next rival.\n\nPaul will fight two-time heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua on Friday night at the Kaseya Center, home of the NBA’s Miami Heat. The scheduled eight-round bout will be streamed on Netflix without the pay-per-view designation.\n\nAlthough the 36-year-old Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) has not fought since September 2024, when he was knocked out by Daniel Dubois in five rounds, he is the prohibitive favorite to derail Paul’s ambitious fight plans.\n\n“The odds are stacked against me,” Paul said Wednesday in the fighters’ final media appearance before the bout. “There are no sporting teams in history that have gone together where it’s this big of a difference in terms of skills, experience, resume, height, weight. This is going to be the biggest upset in the history of sport and you guys get to witness it.”\n\nIn their photo standoff that closed Wednesday’s event, the 6-foot-6 Joshua towered over the 6-1 Paul. Joshua also has a six-inch reach advantage, 82-76. In addition, 12 of Paul’s bouts have been at the 200-pound cruiserweight limit.\n\nThe 28-year-old Paul (12-1, 7 KOs) has built his professional record through unconventional methods. He has victories over retired UFC champions Anderson Silva and Nate Díaz and also won a convincing decision against former middleweight titleholder Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.\n\nPaul’s ability to entice 58-year-old Mike Tyson to fight him last year further enhanced the circus-like atmosphere that often define his bouts. Yet, the bout against legendary heavyweight champion, which Paul won by unanimous decision, attracted 72,300 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight also generated a reported 108 million global views.\n\nFor all the followers Paul has won through his social media platforms, he acknowledges there are detractors who view him as an insult to the sport and the fighters who have traveled the arduous trek toward contention and championship opportunities.\n\n“No one has done more for the sport of boxing in the past decade than myself,” said Paul, who also has formed his promotional company that will oversee Friday’s nine-bout card. “I think if people really cared about boxing they’d want me to win.\n\n“I see the angle that they’re coming from – that (Joshua’s) the traditional boxer, that he’s been doing it for his whole life. But I think I’m more important for the sport of boxing. If they actually cared about the sport, they’d want me to win.”\n\nJoshua, who also won an Olympic gold medal representing his native England in the 2012 Summer Games, understands his perceived role as a boxing savior against Paul.\n\n“It just seems I’ve been called in to save the purest of boxing,” Joshua said. “People don’t like the fact that I’m fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question. If we look at the people that don’t want me to be here, they want me to put an end to the Jake Paul show. That’s why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.”\n\nJoshua’s bout against Paul will be his second in the United States. And Joshua wants to leave the ring Friday with a better outcome than in his debut, when Andy Ruiz Jr. knocked him out in seven rounds to end his first heavyweight reign six years ago at Madison Square Garden.\n\n“It was a tragedy. It was a loss,” Joshua said of his first professional defeat. “But if you’re in sports, it may happen. You may take some losses but the goal is to bounce back. Through tragedy there can always be a great story. This is just part of what my life is.”\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",

    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua will outweigh Jake Paul by at least 27 pounds Friday in their controversial Netflix boxing match. The two fighters tipped the scales Thursday at the event’s official weigh-ins in Miami.\n\nJoshua, an Olympic super heavyweight champion and two-time unified heavyweight world champion, weighed in at 243.4 pounds for Friday’s heavyweight collision.\n\nPaul, who was previously preparing for a fight against 135-pound boxing world champion Gervonta Davis before Joshua stepped in on short notice, weighed in at a much lighter 216.4 pounds.\n\nThe vast size difference between the two fighters has been one of many divisive points ahead of this weekend’s matchup. Joshua is one of the most accomplished heavyweights of this era. Standing 6-foot-6 with a gargantuan 82-inch reach, he remains one of the top-ranked boxers in the world. He challenged for the IBF world title in his last fight — a September 2024 loss to Daniel Dubois at London's Wembley Stadium.\n\nBecause of the immense size and skill gap between the two fighters, Joshua was contractually not permitted to weigh-in heavier than 245 pounds.\n\nPaul vs. Joshua will be contested with 10-ounce gloves across eight three-minute rounds at Miami's Kaseya Center. Prelims begin at 4:45 p.m. ET and stream on Netflix's Tudum platform, while the main card begins at 8 p.m. ET and airs live on Netflix, free for all subscribers. Main event rings walks are expected around 10:30 p.m. ET.\n\nUncrowned will have full live coverage and round-by-round results of the action.",

Since then, FIFA has been absent from the video game scene, but today Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive have announced that they will be bringing officially branded FIFA soccer back in a new game slated to launch in 2026.\nThe unnamed FIFA soccer game will be available via the Netflix app on both iOS and Android devices, and it is planned to launch \"this summer,\" just in time for the FIFA World Cup 2026. The official announcement calls the new game a \"newly reimagined FIFA football simulation game,\" but no other details were provided.\nFIFA and Netflix Games\n\"This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA’s commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games,\" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in the offical announcement.",

    "description": "You might think the notion of Saudi money owning part of an American media giant would kill a deal. That's not why it's failed so far.",
    "fullText": "Larry and David Ellison, who own Paramount, want to use $24 billion in Middle Eastern money to finance their bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Is that a problem for WBD?\n\nYou might think so — especially since $10 billion of that came from the Saudi government. That's the same government that US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018. The kind of partner you might think a major American media conglomerate would want to keep at arm's length.\n\nBut that's not a problem WBD raises in its newest communication to shareholders, where it urges them to take the deal offered by Netflix instead.\n\nWhat actually worries WBD about the Ellisons' bid isn't the Ellisons' particular partners. It's that the Ellisons had partners.\n\nIn a regulatory filing that tells the backstory of the proposed WBD sale, WBD execs and their reps repeatedly told the Ellisons they wanted a firm commitment that Larry Ellison — currently the world's 5th-richest man, with an estimated net worth of $243 billion — would guarantee the deal himself.\n\nInstead, WBD argues, the Ellisons never gave them the assurances they wanted.\n\nThe filing does bring up the fact that money from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would likely complicate regulatory issues for a proposed Ellison/Paramount deal. (Ditto for a proposed $1 billion investment from China's Tencent, which the Ellisons later took out of their proposal.) But those are presented as technical hurdles. Not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\n\nAnd they're just part of a laundry list of complaints WBD makes about the Ellisons. Among them: A December 2 tweet from New York Post reporter Charlie Gasparino, which WBD said violated a confidentiality agreement Paramount had signed.\n\nAnd when it comes to the main pitch WBD is making to investors, all of that stuff disappears. It just boils down to \"we did our homework, and the Netflix deal is better.\"\n\nThat's not shocking: If you're a WBD investor, you are (supposedly) only interested in getting the maximum value for shares. And WBD's filing argues that Netflix is the one that can pay the most.\n\nNow we're waiting to see what the Ellisons do next: Many observers believe they'll return with yet another, higher bid. Will this one have Gulf money, too?",

    "fullText": "Netflix will exclusively carry three Barstool Sports video podcasts, marking the streamer's third major podcast deal. Netflix has been readying a slate of shows for early 2026 as it looks to enter the space dominated by YouTube.\n\nNone of the podcasts prominently features Barstool's famous founder, Dave Portnoy, who hosts \"The Unnamed Show.\" The deal also doesn't include Barstool's popular \"Million Dollaz Worth of Game,\" which ranked 33rd in US audience reach in the third quarter, as measured by Edison.\n\nPortnoy said in a statement that he hoped the deal would drive new audiences for the shows. Netflix pointed to the shows' \"unfiltered commentary, sharp takes, and undeniable humor\" as a reason behind the deal.\n\nNetflix has made similar deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia. As with those deals, the video versions of the Barstool shows will be pulled off YouTube and run exclusively on Netflix. The audio versions will remain available elsewhere. The deal includes new episodes and certain library episodes of each show.\n\nNetflix's move into video podcasts is part of a broader effort to expand its content offerings beyond its core of TV series and movies. The streamer has added content from YouTubers like Mark Rober, event-focused sports fare, and games as it looks to boost engagement time. Netflix is also aiming to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business.\n\nThe Barstool deal brings the total number of shows involved in Netflix deals to at least 33.

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount Skydance and CEO David Ellison again. Read WBD's full letter to shareholders.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery still isn't interested in Paramount Skydance's offer.\n\nParamount's latest bid \"is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders\" compared to Netflix's bid, which \"represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders,\" said Samuel Di Piazza, the chair of WBD's board of directors, in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, WBD's board recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's all-cash bid of $30 per share in favor of Netflix's cash-and-stock offer. Paramount wants to buy all of WBD, including its cable channels, while Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share is for WBD's studio, HBO, and HBO Max. A key difference between the two bids revolves around the value of WBD's TV networks, such as CNN and TNT, which Netflix isn't interested in buying.\n\nDi Piazza said that Paramount's seventh proposal \"once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated,\" including about Paramount's financing.\n\nParamount has said its bid is fully backstopped by Larry Ellison, one of the richest people in the world and father to Paramount CEO David Ellison. The WBD board said in the letter to shareholders that it relies \"on an unknown and opaque revocable trust\" whose assets or liabilities are subject to change.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix is paying with cash and stock. Its shares have fallen recently but surged more than 600% from mid-2022 to mid-2025. Netflix has a market cap of over $400 billion.\n\nWhile Paramount has said that it would have an easier time securing regulatory approval than Netflix, the WBD board says it \"does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk\" between the two proposals.\n\nThe Ellisons are close to President Donald Trump. However, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has pitched the president on the deal and seems to have earned some respect. Trump has called Sarandos a \"great person,\" though he added that the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem\" on the regulatory front. Still, the president hasn't come out publicly in favor of one side in the deal.\n\nWBD also said its board \"repeatedly engaged\" with interested parties, including the Ellisons. Paramount had previously said that WBD went quiet late in the bidding process.\n\nNot even Paramount can be surprised by WBD's decision to stick with its Netflix deal.\n\nDavid Ellison was overheard saying last week that if WBD's leadership were to \"accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat's because Paramount said its $30-per-share hostile bid was nearly identical to its previous offer to WBD. Public companies are obligated to act in the best interests of shareholders. So if WBD's board had changed its mind, it could have opened itself up to shareholder lawsuits.\n\nWBD had said in a statement after Paramount's hostile bid that it would \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer\" in a way that was \"consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors.\"\n\nNow that WBD's board has given Paramount the cold shoulder again, it's Ellison's move.\n\nThe aspiring media mogul told CEO David Zaslav that Paramount's latest offer wasn't its \"best and final,\" which suggests that a higher bid could be coming. Just how much appetite Paramount has to escalate the bidding war is the key question.\n\nIf no higher bid comes, WBD's investors have until January 8 to back Paramount, though it could extend that deadline. WBD would owe Netflix a $2.8 billion reverse breakup fee if its shareholders chose Paramount.\n\nRead the full letter to shareholders here:\n\nAs your Board of Directors, we are committed to acting in your best interest. In this spirit, in October, we launched a public review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. This followed three separate proposals from Paramount Skydance (\"PSKY\"), as well as interest from multiple other parties.\n\nThat thorough process, overseen by the Board with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, as well as our management team, led to the company entering into a merger agreement with Netflix on December 4, with the substantial benefits to WBD shareholders described below. Having failed to submit the best proposal for you, our shareholders, PSKY launched an offer nearly identical to its most recently rejected proposal.\n\nAs a Board, we have now conducted another review and determined that PSKY's tender offer remains inferior to the Netflix merger. The Board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix merger, and that you reject the PSKY offer and not tender your shares.\n\nBelow, and in more detail in our 14D-9 filing, we highlight the many reasons for the Board's determination. None of these reasons will be a surprise to PSKY given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals.\n\nThe terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD.\n\nThe value we have secured for shareholders through the Netflix merger is extraordinary by any measure.\n\nOur agreement with Netflix gives WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, plus $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock (based on a collar range of $97.91 - $119.67 in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing), plus the additional value of the shares of Discovery Global and the opportunity to participate in future potential upside following Discovery Global's separation from WBD. The entire Board is confident in our recommendation that Netflix represents the best value-creating path for shareholders.\n\nPSKY has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a \"full backstop\" from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.\n\nPSKY's most recent proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding. Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was — and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming — the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.\n\nAnd a revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder. The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change. As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time. And the documents provided by PSKY for this conditional commitment contain gaps, loopholes and limitations that put you, our shareholders, and our company at risk.\n\nAmplifying the concerns about the credibility of the equity commitment being offered by PSKY, the revocable trust and PSKY have agreed that the trust's liability for damages, even in the case of a willful breach, would be capped at 7% of its commitment ($2.8 billion on a $108.4 billion transaction). Of course, the damage to WBD and its stockholders were the trust or PSKY to breach their obligations to close a transaction would likely be many multiples of this amount.\n\nWBD's merger agreement with Netflix is a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments. The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet. The debt financing for the PSKY bid relies on an unsecure revocable trust commitment as well as the credit worthiness of a $15 billion market cap company with a credit rating at or only a notch above \"junk\" status from the two leading rating agencies. The financial condition and creditworthiness of PSKY, which, if its proposed transaction were to close, would have a high gross leverage ratio of 6.8x 2026E debt to EBITDA with virtually no current free cash flow generation before synergies, raise substantial risks for its acquisition of WBD. Such debt levels reflect a risky capital structure that is vulnerable to even potentially small changes in the PSKY or WBD business between signing and closing.\n\nAdditionally, PSKY contemplates $9 billion in synergies from the mergers of Paramount/Skydance and their offer for WBD. These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.\n\nThe Board's review was full, transparent and comprehensive — establishing a level playing field that fostered a rigorous and fair process.\n\nThe Board repeatedly engaged with all parties, including extensive engagement with PSKY and its advisors over the course of nearly three months. We held dozens of calls and meetings with its principals and advisors including four in-person meetings and meals between David Zaslav and David and/or Larry Ellison and provided multiple opportunities for PSKY to offer a proposal that was superior to those of the other bidders, which PSKY never did.\n\nAfter each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions. Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.\n\nDespite PSKY's media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.\n\nThe Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the PSKY offer with its regulatory advisors. The Board believes that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material. The Board also notes that Netflix has agreed to a record-setting regulatory termination cash fee of $5.8 billion, significantly higher than PSKY's $5 billion break fee.\n\nThe offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion; it is not the same thing as a binding merger agreement. The first paragraph of the offer states it is \"subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time)\" and continues on the next page, \"we reserve the right to amend the Offer in any respect (including amending the Offer Price)\". In addition, the offer is not capable of being completed by its current expiration date, due to the need for, among other things, global regulatory approvals, which PSKY indicates may take 12-18 months. Nothing in this structure offers WBD shareholders any deal certainty.\n\nThe PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders.\n\nThere will be additional costs associated with PSKY's offer that could impact shareholders.\n\nWhen considering the PSKY offer at this juncture, it is important to note that its acceptance could incur significant additional costs to shareholders — all of which PSKY has ignored in their communications. WBD would have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee, which PSKY has not offered to reimburse. In addition, WBD would incur approximately $1.5 billion in financing costs if we do not complete our planned debt exchange as agreed to with certain of our debtholders, which would not be permitted by the PSKY offer. This additional $4.3 billion in potential costs represents approximately $1.66 per share to be borne by WBD shareholders if the offer does not close.\n\nWe look forward to moving ahead with our combination with Netflix and delivering the compelling and certain value it will create for shareholders. We urge you to carefully read the 14D-9 filed with the SEC this morning and available on our website, which more fully details the strategic review process and the Board's reasons for its recommendation to you.\n\nThe Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors",

    "fullText": "if you thought Drake’s bets were reckless, meet Hollywood producer Jon Peters.\n\nThe former head of Sony Pictures bet $5 million on Jake Paul’s Netflix fight against Anthony Joshua, and is so convinced that “El Gallo” will pull off the upset, Peters even convinced his children to wager separate bets, with a total combined payoff in the neighborhood of $50 million.\n\nPerhaps I was wrong about bettors “going broke.”\n\n“This is my first time I’ve ever bet on anybody in my life, other than myself, because I’ve been watching his career, and he’s like me,” Peters told TMZ Sports. “He’s like a weed that grew into an oak tree. When I talked to Jake on the telephone, and he [said] he would rather die than lose, I wanted to hear that. The other guy, is this just another win? He’s a champion. He’s also seven years, eight years older. I think Jake may knock him out in the first round. I’ve been a fighter my whole life. I know about fighting. I just believe it. And I have my kids betting on it, too. With everybody betting, we could make $50 million.”\n\nDon’t worry, his kids are “all millionaires.”\n\n“I already told [Jake] that I have options on a movie called Bullitt, Steve McQueen movie,” Peters added. “And I’ve been wanting to do it with Brad Pitt, but he’s a little old — and Paul is a movie star. Girls like him, kids like him, people like him. He’s a modern day phenom. But once he wins this, I think he will want to go fight that big, tall guy in England. The shorter guy can punch up easier than a big guy can punch down. When you punch down, you lose your power. When you punch up, you twist your legs, and you snap that punch into the ribs, and you snap that punch into the head, and bang, there you go.”\n\nHard to imagine this iconic car chase with “El Gallo” behind the wheel.\n\nI don’t know if this qualifies as “suspicious betting activity” but it’s certainly raising a few eyebrows when you consider all the sports-related betting scandals over the last several weeks. With this kind of money in play, it will be hard to dodge allegations of fight fixing if Paul, who was outboxed by Tommy Fury, somehow beats the 28-4 Joshua, a former heavyweight champion with scary knockout power and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nOne more reason to tune into Netflix on Friday night, I suppose.",

    "description": "Netflix's podcast deal with iHeartMedia brings exclusive video podcasts like \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"My Favorite Murder\" to the streamer in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Netflix just made its second big podcast move, announcing a deal with iHeartMedia to exclusively host the video versions of more than a dozen of its shows.\n\nThose shows include \"The Breakfast Club,\" cohosted by popular radio personality Charlamagne tha God; true crime show \"My Favorite Murder\"; and \"Dear Chelsea\" with Chelsea Handler.\n\nNetflix said the shows will launch on its platform in early 2026 in the US, with other markets to follow.\n\nNetflix stressed the variety of the shows available through the deal. Bob Pittman, iHeartMedia's CEO, said it let his company complement its audio foundation with a leading video-first service. The video versions of the shows will only be available on Netflix — and crucially won't be on YouTube — while iHeartMedia retains the audio-only rights and distribution.\n\nThe deal is Netflix's second big foray into video podcasts after announcing a similar deal with Spotify in October for shows including \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" \"The Rewatchables,\" and \"Conspiracy Theories.\"\n\nNetflix's move into video podcasts is part of a broader effort to expand its content offerings beyond its core of TV series and movies. The streamer has added content from YouTubers like Ms. Rachel, sports programming, and even games as its engagement time has flattened. Netflix is also seeking to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business.\n\nBesides its Spotify and iHeartMedia deals, Netflix has explored potential pacts with individual podcasters, including Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame, two people familiar with the talks previously told Business Insider. Netflix has also been looking to hire a video podcast executive.\n\nThe streamer told potential partners it wants to have 50 to 75 shows when its video podcasts launch in early 2026, two dealmakers previously told Business Insider, with one hearing the platform was looking to build that number to as many as 200 over time.\n\nThe iHeartMedia deal checks a few boxes for Netflix, which, in keeping with its stated goal of serving everyone, has been seeking shows across various genres, including pop culture, true crime, sports, and comedy. \"The Breakfast Club\" is the 15th most listened to podcast, according to Edison Research, and its daily format could help Netflix establish itself as a routine destination. The deal notably doesn't include iHeartMedia's other podcasts in the top 50, including the flagship \"Stuff You Should Know,\" \"Club Shay Shay,\" and \"On Purpose with Jay Shetty.\"\n\nNetflix's podcast negotiations have, in general, been complicated by the fact that video distribution rights are often controlled by a mix of the host and the network.\n\nFor some podcasters, being on Netflix offers a potential new audience and the prestige of being part of a curated offering. However, for others, Netflix's demand for video exclusivity would mean giving up the important ad revenue and reach they gain on YouTube, and potentially alienating their fans who find them there.\n\nThere are also questions about how much Netflix will promote the shows and what viewer data it'll share with hosts, who are accustomed to receiving robust data on their shows from YouTube.\n\nPodcasts are mostly an audio experience, but people are increasingly watching them in video form. An Edison Research report in July found that over half (51%) of people in the US 12 and up said they had watched a video podcast, with 37% having watched one in the previous month.\n\nHere are all the shows initially coming to Netflix as part of the iHeart deal:",
