    "description": "If you can't wait for all of season four of Netflix's \"Bridgerton,\" you may want to read some historical romance books that spark the same flame.",
    "fullText": "Though it's the fourth season of the Netflix series, Sophie and Benedict's story is actually the third book in Julia Quinn's \"Bridgerton\" series, and it's definitely worth reading if you haven't yet.\n\nIn the novel, the gentle reader finds Sophie at a crossroads. An illegitimate child, Sophie's biological father raised her as his ward, but after he died, her stepmother forced her to become a servant for herself and her two daughters. She finally gets the chance to be a proper lady of the ton for one night when she attends the Bridgerton masquerade ball in disguise. There, she crosses paths with Benedict Bridgerton, and they share an evening that will change both of them forever.\n\nTry as he might, Benedict can't forget the mystery woman he met at the masquerade, who disappeared without even telling him her name. He's been searching for her for years when he crosses paths with Sophie again — this time, when she is working as a maid — but he doesn't recognize her.\n\nHer familiarity nags at Benedict, but he soon finds himself drawn to the Sophie he knows now. Their relationship seems impossible because of their social standings and because of the piece of his heart that still belongs to his mysterious masquerade woman, but true love always finds a way.\n\nA \"Cinderella\" retelling full of longing and forbidden love, \"An Offer from a Gentleman\" showcases Quinn at her finest.\n\n\"Bringing Down the Duke\" is the first installment in Evie Dunmore's \"A League of Extraordinary Women\" series.\n\nIt follows Annabelle Archer, one of the first women admitted to the University of Oxford in 1879. Annabelle is a scholarship student, and her financial support depends on her commitment to recruiting influential men to join the suffragette movement.\n\nAnnabelle doesn't know how she'll convince Sebastian Devereux, the Duke of Montgomery, to help her cause. His support is crucial because he directly influences the Queen's policies, but the removed Sebastian is more interested in finding a suitable wife than in women's rights.\n\nWorst of all, neither Annabelle nor Sebastian expected the palpable attraction between them, threatening to derail everything they were both working toward. They'll have to see which is more powerful: their goals or their feelings for each other.\n\nIf you love the ensemble cast of \"Bridgerton,\" Krystal Marquis' \"The Davenports\" is the perfect addition to your to-be-read list.\n\nInspired by the true story of Charles Richard Patterson, Marquis' novel follows the family of William Davenport, a previously enslaved man who became a successful business owner with the Davenport Carriage Company. By 1910, his family is wealthy and secure, and his children — particularly his daughters Olivia and Helen — have become fixtures of high society.\n\nWhen \"The Davenports\" begins, Olivia is set on marrying a suitable match until she finds herself drawn to Washington DeWight, a civil rights activist, while Helen can't stop thinking about the man who is supposed to be courting her sister, Jacob Lawrence. Meanwhile, the girls' former close friend and current maid, Amy-Rose, and Olivia's best friend, Ruby, end up in a love triangle with John Davenport, Olivia and Helen's charming brother, until Ruby falls for someone she never anticipated.\n\nFull of heart and no shortage of romance, the first installment of \"The Davenports\" series will scratch the same itch as \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nLike \"Bridgerton,\" Diana Gabaldon's historical romance \"Outlander\" became a successful TV series, but unlike Quinn's works, her nine-book series comes with a side of magic.\n\nWhen \"Outlander\" begins, former combat nurse Claire Randall is trying to find her footing after the end of World War II in 1945. In an attempt to find a new normal, Claire and her husband Frank visit the Scottish Highlands, but a walk through a stone circle sends Claire back in time to 1743, when war was the backdrop of Scotland.\n\nClaire is desperate to return to her life, but to stay alive, she is forced to marry the surprisingly kind warrior, Jamie Fraser. As time passes, her reluctant marriage to Jamie becomes a passion Claire has never known. Will she return to her life in the future or take on an adventure in the past she never expected?\n\nKJ Charles' \"The Magpie Lord\" has all the aristocratic fun of \"Bridgerton\" with the added flair of dark magic.\n\nIt's been two decades since Lucien Vaudrey set foot in London following his exile to China. When his father and brother suddenly die, Lucien has to return to a life he never expected as the new Lord Crane.\n\nHowever, his earldom comes with the same adversaries his father had, leaving Lucien in danger of nefarious magic. He enlists the help of Stephen Day, a magician who can't stand the Crane family, to help him.\n\nStephen expects to loathe Lucien as he did his relatives, but to his surprise, Lucien is relaxed, tattooed, and clearly wants him. As Stephen's feelings for Lucien deepen, evil continues to invade the lord's home, putting them both at risk.\n\nAmanda Briars decides to take her sexuality into her own hands in \"Suddenly You\" by Lisa Kleypas.\n\nAs a 30th birthday gift to herself, author and spinster Amanda decides to seek out a male companion so she can experience intimacy. So when Jack Delvin, a publisher who wants to work with her, appears on her doorstep, she assumes he's there for a very different reason, leading to a night of passion neither anticipated.\n\nAfter their encounter, Amanda and Jack still have to work together, and neither can ignore their attraction. Will their different backgrounds keep them apart, or will love bring them together?\n\nIf you want a romance like \"Bridgerton\" with a touch of darkness, \"The Wisteria Society of Lady Scoundrels\" by India Holton will hit the spot.\n\nAlthough Cecilia Bassingwaite appears to be a demure Victorian woman, she's actually a thief. She uses her societal standing to swindle goods from England's upper class as a member of the Wisteria Society of Lady Scoundrels.\n\nAssassin for hire Ned Lightbourne is tasked with taking Cecilia out for his boss, Captain Morvath, but everything changes when Ned lays eyes on her.\n\nCecilia and Ned have no choice but to work together to save the Wisteria Society from Morvath's wrath — drawing them closer and closer together.\n\nIn \"Rebel\" by Beverly Jenkins, Valinda Lacy is building a new life for herself in Reconstruction-era New Orleans.\n\nOriginally from New York City, Valinda has big dreams of helping rebuild the city, but her hopes are dashed when ruffians make a target of her and the school she created.\n\nArchitect Captain Drake LeVeq steps in to help Valinda and is immediately smitten with her. Drake finds everything about Valinda alluring, especially her independence, so he's devastated to learn she has a responsible fiancé waiting for her in New York.\n\nThe more time Val spends in New Orleans with Drake, the less she wants to return to the life set out for her.\n\nThe first installment of Jenkins' \"Women Who Dare\" series, \"Rebel,\" is exciting and steamy.\n\nThe first installment in Tessa Dare's \"Girl Meets Duke\" series is \"The Duchess Deal,\" a perfect story for fans of the marriage-of-convenience trope.\n\nThe Duke of Ashbury rarely leaves his home after the war, hiding the burns and scars he took home with him. However, he needs to have a child, so he has to get married.\n\nWhen his fiancée abruptly pulls out of the wedding, and he spots his seamstress, Emma Gladstone, with the dress in hand, he gets Emma to agree to step in and become the duchess.\n\nThe duke plans to keep Emma at arm's length, only visiting her bed at night to produce an heir. That won't work for Emma, though, who insists they dine together every night. And the longer Emma is in the Duke of Ashbury's world, the more enamored she is.\n\nLike \"Bridgerton,\" Liana De la Rosa's \"Ana María and the Fox\" takes place during a society season in Victorian London.\n\nMexican heiress Ana María Luna Valdés ends up in London with her sisters when the French occupy her home country, giving her the chance to see what life is like when she isn't under her father's watchful eye. She can't help but notice Gideon Fox, a politician with ambitious plans to bring an end to the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nGideon is sure he doesn't have time for a romance with anyone, no matter how alluring he finds Ana. To his dismay, he has no choice but to protect her when a rival politician makes advances on her — nor does he have a choice in the feelings he develops for her.\n\nIf you like the class tension in \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" Quinn's \"A Night Like This\" might be right up your alley.\n\nThe second novel in the \"Smythe-Smith Quartet\" follows Anne Wynter, the governess for three cousins in the Smythe-Smith family (who will be familiar to fans of \"Bridgerton\"). Being a governess isn't her dream job, but it works for Anne, especially since it helps her keep her real identity private.\n\nAnne is hopeful she can maintain her low profile until Daniel Smythe-Smith, the Earl of Winstead, returns to town, and he immediately sets his sights on her. Anne has had no trouble resisting men in the past, but there's something about Daniel that stirs feelings in her she never anticipated.\n\nWhen enemies from Daniel's past threaten not only him but Anne, he'll show her just how far he's willing to go to protect her.\n\nLike \"Bridgerton,\" the \"Bedwyn Saga\" follows a rambunctious family, and the first installment, \"Slightly Married,\" focuses on the second eldest son, Aidan Bedwyn.\n\nAidan might look tough, but underneath it all, the colonel has a soft heart. That warmth leads him to visit Ringwood Manor after one of his soldiers died, determined to care for the man's sister in his stead.\n\nInstead of finding a grieving, helpless woman, he meets Eve, an enchanting and fearless woman who quickly makes clear that Aidan's help is the last thing she wants. However, when Aidan offers to marry her so she can keep her home, Eve feels she has no choice but to accept.\n\nAlthough Aidan is immediately drawn to Eve, the pair agree to a loveless marriage, but one kiss may undo everything they had planned.",

    "description": "Here's everything you need to know about the adrenaline trip that will be \"Skyscraper Live\" on Netflix",
    "fullText": "Calling all adrenaline junkies, Netflix has a broadcast specifically for you this week. Well, it’s specifically for adrenaline junkies who are probably not also stressed out by heights.\n\nOn Friday, professional climber Alex Honnold will be scaling his next mountain — except it’s not a mountain. Instead, he’ll be free-climbing a literal skyscraper, and yes, free-climbing means exactly what you think it does. He’ll have no ropes or harnesses attached, no safety nets to land in, he’s just…climbing a building.\n\nThe climb will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Netflix, on Friday, Jan. 23. It will be streamed live, so you can see the whole thing.\n\nAlex Hannold is a professional rock climber, who you might recognize from the documentary “Free Solo.” He’s a veteran at climbing.\n\nHannold will be scaling Taipei 101, one of the tallest buildings in the world. As you likely guessed from its name, the building is in Taiwan.\n\nIn total, Taipei 101 has, well, 101 stories. It’s 1,667 feet tall.\n\nIn Hannold’s own words: “Why not?” According to the climber, the building is “possible, which a lot of skyscrapers aren’t — it’s uniquely suited for climbing.”\n\nIt appears not. Hannold will truly solo climb and he admitted to Tudum himself that “My life is on the line.”\n\nAccording to Hannold himself, if something goes wrong, he’ll probably die, as he explained to CNN during a recent sit-down interview. However, as he noted, with this particular building, there are a lot of balconies spread out accross a long stretch of the climb “The geometry of the building, the shape of the building is such that you actually could fall in tons of places and not actually die,” Hannold described, “which makes it in some ways safer than a lot of rock-climbing objectives.”\n\nIn the same interview, Hannold described it as a low-risk, high-consequence activity — meaning that, most likely, he’ll incur no injury at all, but if something goes wrong, the stakes are extremely high. In contrast, he describes sports football as high-risk, lower-consequence, since athletes regularly have career-ending, but not life-ending, accidents on the field.\n\nProducers have also clarified that there will be a 10-second delay, and if the worst should happen, they will cut away.\n\nThe post ‘Skyscraper Live’: Where to Watch, Who’s Climbing and What Happens If He Falls appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "title": "How Netflix's stock lost its FANG-era mojo",
    "description": "The streaming giant is putting a lot of cash to work, and it's not growing as quickly as investors want.",
    "fullText": "The last decade in the stock market has been dominated by two distinct eras.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, \"FAANG stocks\" were all the rage. The elite crew of Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) represented the big winners of the mobile and cloud-computing explosion.\n\nIn more recent years, the Magnificent 7 — populated by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — has taken the reins. Driven by immense optimism over the future profitability of AI, the group has become a market-moving behemoth.\n\nSomewhere, during that transition, one piece of the FAANG cohort lost its elite status and did not roll over into the Mag 7: Netflix.\n\nThe exclusion makes sense. Netflix isn't known as an AI stock, so it doesn't naturally fit with the Mag 7. And based on the relative underperformance of Netflix shares over the last five years, compared to every stock in the group but Amazon, it's clear investors have accepted its spot away from the \"cool table\" in the cafeteria.\n\nSo what exactly is up with Netflix lately? Its latest earnings report from this week offers a good encapsulation of the company's recent issues:\n\nNetflix's pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery is expected to add hundreds of millions in costs in 2026. This comes alongside plans to boost TV-show and film spending by 10%.\n\nThe company is forecasting revenue growth of roughly 13% this year, down from 16% in 2025. And it's going to get more expensive to sustain that growth if Netflix continues its push into pricier new areas like live sports — a key push in its battle with YouTube over viewer eyeballs.\n\nThe $11 billion of free cash flow forecasted by Netflix missed analyst estimates.\n\nShares dropped as much as 6% before finishing 2% lower, at a one-year low. The prolonged decline can be traced back to mid-2025.\n\nNetflix's two prior earnings reports, in July and October, were among the main culprits. The company faced many of the same issues as its elite Mag 7 peers — namely sky-high expectations, sensitivity to heavy spending, and surprise tax charges.\n\nThe main difference is that Netflix doesn't have the backstop of the AI trade. It hasn't been given the same benefit of the doubt that its big spending will translate into gold-plated earnings growth.\n\nStill, on the heels of Netflix's multimonth slump, analysts are predominantly bullish. 65% of analysts have a \"buy\" on the stock at current levels, while just 4% have a \"sell.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley says the company's progress towards quickly building a $3 billion-plus advertising business is being underrated by the market. Other firms, meanwhile, simply think the stock has fallen so much that its valuation looks attractive.\n\nThe question now becomes if investors will buy in and start pushing Netflix back to the great heights it once enjoyed.",

    "title": "Here's How Netflix Plans to Add TikTok-Style Videos to Its Mobile App",
    "description": "Expect to see clips from \"Stranger Things\" and Pete Davidson's podcast sometime this year.",
    "fullText": "The funny thing about smartphone addiction is that it makes low-effort tasks feel totally productive. When I finally quit doomscrolling through Instagram and TikTok and watch an actual movie or TV show, I feel like I've just spent the afternoon studying physics. Platforms like Netflix, which could once be seen as time-wasting entertainment, now seem like antidotes to endless, useless scrolling.\n\nBut Netflix doesn't seem to appreciate its new role. Instead, the company apparently sees short-form video apps—and smartphones themselves—as a direct threat to its business, and is jumping on the bandwagon. It's not only that Netflix is reportedly now making content with phone scrollers in mind, encouraging creators to craft dialogue that makes their shows and movies easy to understand even if you're not actually paying attention.\n\nNo Netflix also wants to position its mobile app as an actual competitor to TikTok and Instagram, by introducing a short-form video feed directly within the app.\n\nThe company officially introduced its plans for short-form video during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters announced the company will roll out a new app later this year that will include its take on the vertical video feed. This isn't totally new, as the company has been experimenting with vertical video feeds since May. But it's the first time we've seen a larger announcement about how Netflix plans to integrate the short-form experience directly into its app.\n\nUnlike TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, you won't hop on the Netflix app to find short-form videos from independent creators. Instead, Netflix will serve users clips from Netflix-distributed shows and movies in a scrollable TikTok-style feed. You might swipe through this feed and see clips from Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, or His & Hers. Many of us already waste our time watching clips from shows and movies on other platforms—often cropped, slowed down or sped up, in low-quality, and besieged by artifacts meant to throw off copyright claims. Netflix obviously won't need to do this, so I expect the experience will be filled with high-quality videos (depending on how you define \"quality\" of course).\n\nIt won't just be TV shows and movies on the feed. Netflix also has big plans for its video podcasts, as evidenced by recent programs like The Pete Davidson Show and recent deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia to bring existing podcasts to its platform. Expect Netflix to sprinkle clips from these video podcasts into the short-form feed to create an experience that sounds not too far off from scrolling through other apps. How many clips you do see from video podcasts, TV shows, and movies on TikTok?\n\nAs Netflix inches closer to acquiring Warner Bros., you might soon be seeing a lot of official short-form content in the Netflix app. If and when the acquisition closes, I wouldn't be surprised to see clips from HBO shows like A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, The White Lotus, and Euphoria.\n\nI get the move from a business perspective: Netflix is likely losing subscribers' attention due to the addictive nature of vertical video apps. But do any of us really need another app to scroll through, especially when we're already paying for access to the full content to begin with? Maybe could be a helpful avenue to find new shows and movies to watch, but in all likelihood, it will just be be another addictive time-waster. I have too many of those in my life as it is.",

    "description": "Welcome back, \"Star Search.\"",
    "fullText": "When Netflix isn't spending its time trying to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, it seems the company is actually adding new features to its subscription service. Netflix is always adding new shows and movies, which is what most users are looking for in the platform, but that's not all you can expect from your account. In fact, Netflix is now rolling out an interactive experience for its live competition shows, allowing subscribers to cast votes in real-time.\n\nNetflix announced the change in a press release on Tuesday, and also revealed the first show to officially run with real-time voting: Star Search. Netflix is bringing back the American Idol precursor tonight at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT), and will allow viewers to choose which contestant they like best alongside \"millions of others.\"\n\nNetflix says it first tested the feature with the show Dinner Time Live with David Chang, and \"learned firsthand how members appreciated the seamless and integrated ways they could participate in the series.\" I don't think you need a focus group to know that people like sharing their opinions on things, but then, I'm not a Netflix exec.\n\nThe company clarified in its press release that only live events will work with real-time voting. If you watch a show after it airs, you won't be able to cast your vote—which, obviously, makes sense. The show doesn't really need to know who you'd pick as a winner after the winner has already been chosen—though Netflix could always use the extra user data, I'm sure.\n\nStar Search is the only show at this time that supports this feature, but Netflix says more real-time voting shows are on the way.\n\nNetflix says that when you watch a live event, you'll be able to vote when watching on TV or a streaming device. You won't be able to vote if you're watching in a web browser, nor will you be able to vote if you rewind, pause, or tune-in late.\n\nWhen you join a live program, make sure you do so on a smart TV, supported streaming device (such as Apple TV, Fire TV, or Roku), or the Netflix mobile app. If you want to watch in a web browser, you can still vote on your phone at the same time.\n\nNetflix will prompt you when it's time to vote. You'll see a 1–5 star rating appear on the screen. Click on tap on the star level you want for each performer. Note that each profile only has one chance to vote per performance, so you can't issue another vote after you cast one—you'll just need to wait until the next performance.",

    "description": "Actor Matt Damon said Netflix wants action movies to reiterate plot lines multiple times because people are on their phones while watching a movie.",
    "fullText": "Netflix wants to change the way action movies are made amid the never-ending battle for our sustained attention, according to \"Bourne\" actor Matt Damon.\n\nIn an interview on the \"Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, Damon and longtime collaborator and friend Ben Affleck spoke about their latest experience costarring in and coproducing their first Netflix-exclusive heist film, \"The Rip,\" which was released Friday. The two actors talked about how streaming and short-form video platforms have upended the way movies are consumed, made, and sold to audiences.\n\nDamon said Netflix is now asking for action films to have bigger sequences occur within the first five minutes of the movie and suggesting that actors reiterate the plot line to cater to viewers who are on their phones.\n\nThe actor said the \"standard way\" he learned to make an action film was to have the finale — \"the big one with all the explosions\" that a production spends most of its money on — occur in the third act.\n\n\"Now, they're like, 'Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay tuned in. And you know it wouldn't be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they're watching,'\" he said. \"And so then it's going to really start to infringe on how we're telling a story.\"\n\nDamon didn't specify if Netflix gave the instruction to the actor and producer for his latest heist movie.\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment sent during the weekend.\n\nAffleck added that the suggestions aren't reflected in every new action film or series coming out on Netflix. The actor pointed to \"Adolescence,\" a crime miniseries that has episodes shot in one continuous take. The show was released in March.\n\nDamon said he felt the show was an exception.\n\n\"My feeling is just that it demonstrates that you don't need to do any of that\" stuff, Affleck said.\n\nHe later added, \"It's like supply and demand. People want to look at their phones, they look at TikTok, they're going to do that. I think what you can do is make shit the best you can. Make it really good.\"",

    "description": "Smart and her family open up about her shocking 2002 abduction in the middle of the night in a new Netflix documentary out Jan. 21",
    "fullText": "Elizabeth Smart opens up about the horrors she endured for nine months in the new Netflix documentary, Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart\n\nStreaming Jan. 21, the documentary has Smart giving brutal details about being raped by Brian David Mitchell up to four times a day, being walked like a dog with a cable around her neck and tethered to a tree for long stretches\n\nShe is joined in the documentary by her family, witnesses and law enforcement, who provide their perspectives to Smart's harrowing story\n\nStanding in a weather-worn tent in the foothills of Utah just after being kidnapped from her bedroom in the middle of the night, Elizabeth Smart wasn’t sure what was going to happen next.\n\nSometime after 1 a.m., on June 5, 2002, Smart, then 14, awoke to a scary-looking man with a full beard standing over her bed and ordering her to come with him.\n\nHolding a knife to her neck, the man, Brian David Mitchell, then 48, a self-styled prophet who went by the name Immanuel, marched the terrified teenager out of the backdoor of her family’s Salt Lake City home, into the backyard and up into the rugged foothills to a desolate campsite.\n\nInside the tent at the campsite, Mitchell’s wife, Wanda Barzee, then 56, who went by the name Hephzibah, told Smart to take off her pajamas and put on a loose-fitting robe.\n\nOtherwise, the older woman explained, she was going to have Mitchell come in there and “rip the clothes off of you,” Smart says in the new Netflix documentary, Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart, debuting Jan. 21.\n\nA happily married mother of three, Smart, 38, has spoken out about her nightmarish ordeal before. She’s authored several bestselling books about her experience, started the Elizabeth Smart Foundation to help end sexual violence and used her platform as one of the most well-known survivors of all time to advocate for others.\n\nWhat’s different this time is that she is telling her story alongside her father, Ed Smart, 70, her sister, Mary Katherine Smart, 33, witnesses who saw Smart wearing a veil with her head covered but didn’t realize she was the missing girl authorities had been searching for and members of law enforcement who worked the case.\n\nHaving so many voices in the documentary “gives the story so much more perspective,” Smart tells PEOPLE.\n\nShe hopes being so honest about the brutal treatment she endured, including being raped up to four times a day, being kept in a dark hole, and being chained up for hours, will help others better understand the realities victims face during and well after they are violated.\n\n“I want other survivors to know they're not alone, that actually there's so many of us,\" she says.\n\nThat surreal night, Smart waited for Mitchell to come into the tent. As a self-professed “late bloomer,” the thought of what might come next was unthinkable, and still shrouded a bit in mystery.\n\nShortly before the abduction, she remembers, “My friend told me kind of what sex really was and I was like, ‘What? My parents have done that six times? That is terrible!’ And that was all I knew about sex.”\n\nWhat she knew from church is that sex before marriage was strictly taboo. “Otherwise, you’re dirty, you’re ruined,” she says. “They used all sorts of analogies like when you have sex before marriage, it’s like someone chewed a piece of gum -- and nobody wants a chewed-up piece of gum.”\n\nMoments later, Mitchell strode into the tent and declared that he was going to make Smart his wife, right there and then. She screamed, “No!” she recalls, prompting him to levy the first of many threats. \"If you ever scream out like that again, I will kill you,” he told her.\n\nThen it came time for them to “consummate our marriage,” she recalls him telling her. She tried to stop him, but could not.\n\n“I was sobbing,” she says. “I begged him to stop. I remember it just being so painful.”\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nThe assault caused her so much pain that when he left the tent she remembers blood running down her thighs before passing out.\n\nThen came a different type of pain. When she awoke, all she could think about was “being that chewed up piece of gum, being ruined beyond repair, feeling like I'd lost all my worth.”\n\nThat common misconception, she notes, “took years to get over. It took years to be like, any guy who wouldn't want to be with me because of what's happened is not worthy of me.”\n\nConvicted in 2010 of kidnapping Smart, Mitchell was sentenced to life in prison. Convicted of her role in the crimes, Barzee was released from prison in 2018. She was arrested in May 2025 after allegedly visiting two Utah parks, which violated her status as a registered sex offender.\n\nFor more about Elizabeth Smart and her new Netflix documentary,",

    "title": "Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos tries to solve his movie problem",
    "description": "Netflix made streaming movies at home a big part of its pitch. Now, as it tries to buy Warner Bros. and its giant movie business, things are changing.",
    "fullText": "Netflix spent a lot of time arguing that the future of movies was watching them at home, not in theaters.\n\nNow Netflix wants to buy a movie studio that puts movies into theaters. So it's started saying that watching movies in theaters is good, sometimes.\n\nThat's the messaging Netflix has been trying to make ever since it announced plans to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in December. But that messaging hasn't been satisfying to some people who care a lot about the future of movies in theaters.\n\nWhich is why Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos appeared in The New York Times on Friday, talking about how much he likes the business of putting movies into theaters. Again, it's an idea he's been talking about since he announced the (proposed) Netflix/WBD deal on December 5.\n\nSarandos did say one thing he thinks is new and important: A commitment to keep all future Warner Bros. movies in theaters for at least 45 days:\n\nThat 45-day commitment won't mean much to most people. But Sarandos definitely thinks it matters — \"I'm giving you a hard number.\"\n\nThe very abbreviated backstory: Sarandos and Netflix have spent years fighting the idea of a theatrical \"window\" — the amount of time movies spend exclusively in theaters before they move to platforms like streaming services, rentals, and purchases. Their general argument: If people want to watch movies at home — that is, on Netflix — they should get to do that.\n\nNetflix has periodically had to soften that stance to accommodate high-profile movies and talent, which is why you could see Martin Scorcese's \"The Irishman\" in theaters for a few weeks before it came to Netfix in 2019, and why \"Barbie\" director Gretg Gerwig's \"Narnia\" will be in Imax theaters for a couple weeks this fall before it comes to Netflix. Netflix has also periodically debated its streaming-only/mostly stance internally.\n\nBut externally, Sarandos has been a huge promoter of the idea that the future of movies is at home — which happens to align with the fact that moviegoing has been in decline for years. That's not just because of Netflix, but because the internet gives people lots of other things to do besides going to theaters.\n\nNow, as he prepares to buy WBD, Sarandos has had to change his tune. The shortest version of his new one: We weren't in the business of putting movies into theaters, but if we buy WBD, we will be, so we'll do that.\n\nBut that hasn't convinced lots of people that a business built on streaming is going to become one that cares about theaters.\n\nIn part, that's because Sarandos also said things like \"our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members because that's what they're looking for,\" when announcing the deal. He's also said he hopes \"windows will evolve to be much more consumer-friendly to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker\" — which reasonable people believe means he intends for movies to spend less time in theaters.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount, the Hollywood studio that would like to buy WBD instead, has made a commitment to putting movies in theaters, and honoring \"healthy traditional windows\" as part of its talking points.\n\nSo now, Sarandos has planted a 45-day flag. Whether that mollifies Hollywood or anyone else is an open question.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance is convinced its offer for Warner Bros. is better than Netflix's offer. Read CEO David Ellison's new letter to WBD shareholders.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison has chosen to continue the fight for control of Warner Bros. Discovery, this time in court.\n\nThe Paramount Skydance CEO has made eight attempts to buy WBD, all of which have been rebuffed. That includes his most recent $30-per-share bid, which was spurned in favor of Netflix's offer. Paramount is attempting to acquire the entire company, including its TV networks, such as CNN, TBS, and TNT. Netflix's cash-and-stock offer is $27.75 per share for just WBD's studio and streaming assets.\n\nNow, Paramount is suing WBD \n\nIf WBD's Global Networks business — the division that houses its cable TV networks — is worth substantially less than $2.25 per share, then Paramount's $30-per-share bid could look more attractive to shareholders than Netflix's proposal. Paramount has argued that WBD's cable channels have a $0-per-share equity value, implying they're worth about as much as the estimated $15 billion in debt that WBD intends to saddle them with.\n\n\"WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its 'risk adjustment' of our $30 per share all-cash offer,\" Ellison wrote to WBD investors.\n\nParamount is also initiating a so-called proxy fight where it tries to get representatives on WBD's board of directors.\n\nFor now, Paramount isn't raising the price of its bid. Instead, it is sticking with its all-cash, $30-per-share proposal in hopes that WBD shareholders will see something the board doesn't.\n\n\"WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount,\" Ellison wrote. \"But what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer.\"\n\nParamount appears to be set on finding ways it can win control of WBD without paying more money in a renewed bidding war.\n\n\"Paramount will continue to use all avenues to wrestle WBD away from Netflix,\" said Ross Benes, an analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. \"Lawsuits, shareholder appeals, proxy battles, and so on, individually have little chance of swinging the merger. These tactics are part of a broader strategy to keep pressing until something gives and then seizing on that opportunity.\"\n\nRead Ellison's full letter to WBD shareholders:\n\nDear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder,\n\nOver the last few days, following the decision by Warner Bros. Discovery (\"WBD\") not to engage with Paramount on our $30 per share cash offer to acquire all of WBD, and our reaffirmation of our commitment to delivering our superior offer to WBD shareholders, we keep getting the same question: what happens next?\n\nParamount started this process about four months ago with a private offer at a significant premium to WBD's $12.54 share price, and our pursuit culminated in the $30 per share all-cash, fully financed proposal we made before WBD entered into the Netflix transaction. When we learned of the terms of that transaction, which are inferior both financially and from the standpoint of timing and certainty of closing, we decided to bring our offer directly to you, through our tender offer.\n\nWe are committed to seeing our tender offer through. We understand, however, that unless the WBD board of directors decides to exercise its right to engage with us under the Netflix merger agreement (the \"Netflix Agreement\"), this will likely come down to your vote at a shareholder meeting. We do not know whether that will be at WBD's upcoming annual meeting or a special meeting. The \"advance notice\" window for WBD's 2026 annual meeting opens in three weeks, and Paramount will nominate a slate of directors who, in accordance with their fiduciary duties, will exercise WBD's right under the Netflix Agreement to engage on Paramount's offer and enter into a transaction with Paramount. In addition, Paramount will propose an amendment to WBD's bylaws to require WBD shareholder approval for any separation of Global Networks. If WBD calls a special meeting ahead of its annual meeting to vote on the Netflix Agreement, Paramount will solicit proxies against such approval. These actions, coupled with our tender offer, ensure that you get the final decision on which offer is better for you.\n\nWBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer. Our $30 per share in cash is simply more than Netflix's complex multi-variable consideration comprised of (a) $23.25 in cash plus (b) a number of Netflix shares currently worth $4.11 (at Friday's close) plus (c) the to-be-issued Global Networks equity which we have analyzed as having zero equity value1. In addition to not disclosing the value of the to-be-issued Global Networks spin off, WBD has not disclosed the mechanism by which any debt transferred from Global Networks to the Streaming & Studios segment reduces the cash and stock consideration payable to you.\n\nAlong with the WBD shareholders, we have asked for the customary financial disclosure a board is supposed to provide shareholders when making an investment recommendation. But in each of its 14D-9 filings, WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its \"risk adjustment\" of our $30 per share all-cash offer. WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer — and importantly, Delaware law has consistently required that such information be provided to shareholders. Following the process prescribed under Delaware law, we filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer.\n\nWe do not undertake any of these actions lightly. Make no mistake, our goal remains to have constructive discussions with WBD's Board to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of WBD shareholders. Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders. We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our December 4th offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us. Even as we read WBD's own narrative of its process, we are struck that there were few actual board meetings in the period leading up to the decision to accept an inferior transaction with Netflix. And we are surprised by the lack of transparency on WBD's part regarding basic financial matters. It just doesn't add up — much like the math on how WBD continues to favor taking less than our $30 per share all-cash offer for its shareholders.\n\nThe best outcome for you and for us would be if WBD's Board would exercise the right it has under the Netflix Agreement to engage with Paramount. If it does so, we will be open and constructive to secure the best path forward for WBD and each of you. We have demonstrated our willingness to listen carefully to any feedback we receive from WBD's Board and to respond by offering reasonable solutions — and that remains our mindset and approach.\n\nI believe in our vision for how we can bring these great companies together and deliver for consumers, the creative community and of course, for you. Paramount is committed, my family is committed, and hopefully this helps answer the question of what comes next.\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance is still trying to stop Warner Bros. Discovery's Netflix deal. Here are the four most likely endings in the fight for WBD.",
    "fullText": "The war for Warner Bros. Discovery is getting intense.\n\nParamount Skydance isn't surrendering in its quest to buy WBD, even though its offers have been rejected eight times in favor of Netflix's bid.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison has criticized WBD for not selecting what he's called \"by far the superior offer.\"\n\nWBD has fired back, accusing Paramount of threatening lawsuits and leaking to the press. The company's board of directors said this week in a letter to shareholders that Paramount \"has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction.\"\n\nThere have been many twists and turns in Netflix and Paramount's battle for WBD, and the drama isn't over yet.\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios that could unfold.\n\nAlthough Paramount says its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD provides more value and less risk than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets, the company could up the ante.\n\nSeveral media insiders, including Disney's former top dealmaker, expect a renewed bidding war for WBD.\n\nTheir view got a boost when Paramount disclosed in a filing that Ellison had texted WBD CEO David Zaslav, saying that Paramount's $30-per-share proposal wasn't its \"best and final\" offer.\n\nWBD investors also seem to be counting on more fireworks, given that its stock is trading north of $28.50, close to $1 per share above Netflix's agreed-upon purchase price. That suggests shareholders believe either Ellison and company or Netflix will fork over more money before WBD changes hands.\n\nParamount might not need to offer another penny if a majority of WBD's shareholders tender their shares, which would put pressure on the board to reconsider its proposal.\n\nAs a public company, WBD's leadership is legally required to act in the best interests of its shareholders. Otherwise, its board could be sued. So, if WBD's investors overwhelmingly prefer Paramount's bid, the board could have no choice but to go with it.\n\nHowever, Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners, thinks Paramount won't convince a majority of WBD shareholders to tender their shares. Greenfield predicted that Paramount would then raise its offer to $32 per share, but that Netflix would respond by sweetening its offer, leading to Paramount eventually dropping its bid.\n\nUntil the Netflix deal closes, a competing proposal could come in, since WBD is a public company. Comcast drove up the eventual price of Disney's acquisition of Fox's studio by nearly $20 billion, even though its rival bid came in six months later.\n\nIf Paramount remains adamant that it has a superior proposal that wasn't chosen, it could sue WBD's board of directors, alleging negligence.\n\nWBD has acknowledged that possibility. Paramount \"has been aggressive in its engagement with WBD, has retained litigation counsel and has threatened litigation,\" WBD's board of directors wrote in a letter on Wednesday in which it rejected Paramount's latest offer.\n\nLawyer Raul Gastesi of Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella has taken note of Paramount's litigious posture and said that now that it has been turned down, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit.\"\n\nHowever, Reuben Miller, the head of antitrust at data intelligence firm Dealreporter, said that while Paramount is making waves in the court of public opinion, he believes they \"would rather come with an increased offer and avoid litigation than roll the dice in Delaware court.\"\n\nEven if Paramount decides not to sue, there's a chance WBD shareholders could take legal action against WBD's board.\n\nWhile Paramount has taken a hands-on approach to its WBD bid so far, it could let the chips fall and move on if its proposal doesn't win over enough WBD shareholders.\n\nInstead of spending more than $100 billion on WBD, Paramount could put money toward another acquisition, or simply invest in improving its technology and original content.",

    "description": "Netflix is releasing a film adaptation of Emily Henry's \"People We Meet on Vacation\" on January 9. Here's what to read after you watch.",
    "fullText": "One of the most highly anticipated book-to-screen adaptations of 2026 is undoubtedly \"People We Meet on Vacation\" by Emily Henry.\n\nHenry smashed onto the romance scene in 2020 with \"Beach Read\" and has written five more books since then, each of which has skyrocketed to The New York Times bestseller list.\n\nHenry's summer romance books often approach love with a sense of honesty and fun that the genre needs to thrive. Her characters may be enemies who find themselves living next door to each other or best friends who are scared to risk it all for something more, as is the case in \"People We Meet on Vacation,\" which has been turned into a film set to debut on Netflix on January 9.\n\nWhether you're already a fan of Henry or are just getting to know her work through the movie, \"People We Meet on Vacation\" will likely leave you wanting more. Here are other romance books that might help you fill the void.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is Henry's third summer romance book, and it's both an epic love story and an ode to books themselves.\n\nNora Stephens doesn't think anything is missing in her life. She loves her job as a literary agent, her apartment in New York, and living near her sister, Libby, and her nieces.\n\nWhen Libby asks Nora to escape to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina, for a month, Nora can't say no, especially since Libby is several months pregnant at the time. Libby has big dreams of small-town romance for Nora during their getaway, but instead of finding a local man to have a fling with, Nora keeps running into Charlie Lastra, a grumpy New York editor she's never gotten along with.\n\nDespite their less-than-romantic history, Charlie and Nora keep crossing paths in Sunshine Falls, making the ever-growing list of things they have in common harder to ignore. And when Nora discovers her life as she knows it is about to change, Charlie might be the exact thing she needs.\n\nHenry is at her best in \"Happy Place,\" a novel that ruminates on what it means to fight for love.\n\nHarriet has spent her entire adult life loving Wyn. Their relationship consumes her, and the fact that she met him through her best friends, Sabrina and Cleo, only makes her love him more. Between Wyn and her friends, Harriet found the family she had always wanted in college, and she plans to spend her entire life with them.\n\nWhen Wyn abruptly breaks up with her after she starts her medical school residency, Harriet is heartbroken and terrified she's going to lose everyone she loves. She manages to avoid telling Sabrina and Cleo what happened for five months, planning to burst their bubble on their annual group trip to Maine.\n\nThen, Harriet is shocked to see Wyn when she arrives, and he informs her that they'll have to pretend to be a couple for the duration of the trip, as it's the last vacation the group will ever spend in the house they've loved for years. Harriet doesn't want to cause her friends pain, so she's willing to torture herself for a week.\n\nAll she has to do is stop herself from asking Wyn what went wrong for seven days, but as his displays of fake affection start to feel more and more real, Harriet might have to face her fear of rocking the boat if she wants a true chance at happiness.\n\nHenry's latest book, \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" takes place in the summer and features a love story, but it marks a departure from her typical romances.\n\nJournalist Alice Scott is ready for the biggest challenge of her career to date: convincing the elusive heiress Margaret Ives to let her write her biography.\n\nSunny-dispositioned and thoughtful Alice is sure she can make Margaret comfortable enough to share the story of why she disappeared from public life years ago. However, when she arrives in Little Crescent Island, Georgia, to meet Margaret, she finds she'll be competing against Hayden Anderson, a grumpy and inconveniently handsome writer who happened to win a Pulitzer Prize for his last biography, to tell Margaret's story.\n\nBeating out Hayden for the role might be an uphill battle, but Alice isn't going down without a fight, even after she realizes Margaret is picking and choosing what she tells each of them after getting them to sign strict NDAs. And as they try to unweave Margaret's history, it will become more and more difficult for Alice and Hayden to ignore the heat between them.\n\nBolu Babalola's \"Honey & Spice\" doesn't feel like a debut novel, as she writes romantic chemistry with a deftness Henry herself may envy.\n\nKiki Banjo has made a name for herself at Whitewell University with her radio show \"Brown Sugar.\" She's staked her reputation on her ability to suss out players, warning her peers in the African-Caribbean Society against dating men who aren't worth their time.\n\nThen she risks it all by kissing Malakai Korede in front of everyone after writing him off as \"The Wastemen of Whitewell\" on her show. Kiki is terrified her show is going to slip through her grasp, so she makes a deal with Malakai to pretend to be a couple in the hopes that Kiki can save her show and Malakai can change his reputation on campus.\n\nKiki expects the duration of their fake romance to be torture, but as she and Malakai eat, study, and spend time together, she's unsettled to discover there seems to be more to him than meets the eye. Will Kiki be willing to let go of her preconceived notions for a chance at something real?\n\nLike Henry, Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master at writing about yearning and epic love, as is obvious in \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nMonique Grant's career as a magazine writer is at a standstill when famous — and famously private — film star Evelyn Hugo says she wants to do a tell-all interview with Monique, and only Monique.\n\nMonique doesn't understand why Evelyn would want to work with her of all people, but she can't say no, especially when Evelyn starts opening up to her about her path to fame and the forbidden love that changed the course of her life. Monique feels like Evelyn has handed her the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nWhen she finds out why Evelyn chose her for the tell-all, Monique will have to face truths about their shared history she never expected.\n\nIf you've already read Henry's \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" you'll swoon for \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nLydia Bird's life is turned upside down when the love of her life, Freddie, dies in a car accident. After months of mourning and wanting to go back in time, Lydia begins to move on with the help of her sister and Freddie's best friend.\n\nThen she's given a way to return to her old life with Freddie, a life where the tragedy never occurred. Her heart is pulled in two directions as she struggles to choose between going back to the familiar and embracing the unknown, where someone new wants to love her.\n\nPoignant and fresh, Josie Silver's \"The Two Lives of Lydia Bird\" is a story of love and hope that strikes a similar tone to Henry's works.\n\nOn the night before Drew Nichols is set to be a groomsman in his ex-girlfriend's wedding, he gets stuck in an elevator with the pretty and funny Alexa Monroe, the first bright spot in what he believes will be an unbearable weekend.\n\nImpulse leads him to ask her to be his date to the wedding, and the duo surprises themselves by having more fun together than they bargained for. They plan to part ways after the wedding, neither interested in a long-distance relationship, but fate might have other plans for them.\n\nJasmine Guillory writes about romance with reverence and joy, making \"The Wedding Date\" an ideal read for Henry lovers.\n\nDannie Kohan's plan is on track. In one day, she performs well at the job interview of a lifetime and agrees to marry her long-term boyfriend. Then, when she goes to sleep that night, she wakes up five years in the future, with a different man beside her and his ring on her finger.\n\nDannie only has one hour in the future before she's yanked back to the present, and she tries to push aside the experience as a vivid dream. Then, she meets the man from her dream four and a half years later and discovers he's dating her best friend. Dannie will have to confront what she really wants and find out if she's willing to change her plans to find true happiness.\n\nRebecca Serle's \"In Five Years\" explores time, grief, and all-consuming love, both romantic and platonic, in the same way Henry's books do, challenging the reader to ask themselves how far they would go for true happiness.\n\nAlthough Sally Rooney's beloved \"Normal People\" has a darker tone than Henry's books, the protagonists, Connell and Marianne, have a chemistry and a years-long history that Henry fans will love.\n\nConnell and Marianne meet in high school, when Connell is a popular jock, and Marianne is, well, the opposite. The two bond despite their differences, setting them on a course that will shape their lives, drawing them back to one another over and over again.\n\nRooney's novel shows the inevitability of love, finding words for the often inexplicable reasons people need each other. You can also stream the Hulu series once you finish the book.\n\nLike Henry, Carley Fortune captures the angst and ecstasy of summer love in \"One Golden Summer.\"\n\nAlice can trace back her successful photography career to one photo: a candid shot of three teenagers on a bright yellow speedboat. She captured the shot during the one summer she spent at Barry's Bay with her Nan when she was 17, and it shifted the trajectory of her life.\n\nFifteen years later, Alice should be living her dream as a professional photographer, but six months after a breakup, she feels stuck and uninspired. When Nan breaks her hip, Alice thinks spending another summer at Barry's Bay might be good for them both.\n\nHer vision of a tranquil summer with her grandmother gets upended by Charlie Florek, one of the teens from Alice's famous photo. The glimpse of Charlie that she got across the lake all those years ago was intriguing, but adult Charlie is so devastatingly handsome and thoughtful that he almost scares Alice.\n\nAs they spend the summer together, Charlie heals wounds in Alice that she didn't know were there. If he lets her in, Alice might just do the same for Charlie.\n\nIlya Rozanov and Shane Hollander are supposed to hate each other. Not only have they been competing against each other in hockey since they were 18, but they're also total opposites. Canadian Shane is cautious and focused, while Russian wildcard Ilya isn't afraid to embrace his bad boy reputation on the ice.\n\nThey have one big thing in common, though: the secret hookups they can't seem to resist every time they see each other. If the world found out about their relationship, both Ilya and Shane's careers could be in jeopardy, but they may decide it's worth the risk for a chance at something real with each other.\n\nLike Henry's \"PWMOV,\" Rachel Reid's \"Heated Rivalry\" got adapted, though into a hit TV show instead of a movie, so you can stream the series if you want more from the characters when you finish the book.\n\nChristina Lauren has written dozens of books, but their 2018 novel \"Love & Other Words\" is perfect for fans of \"People We Meet on Vacation\" because of its dual timeline.\n\nMacy Sorensen has been white-knuckling her way through life for nearly a decade, but she's content with the safe world she's constructed for herself. A pediatric resident and newly engaged to a kind man who makes her feel mostly nothing, Macy thinks her heart is safe from the turmoil she experienced in her adolescence — until Elliot Petropoulos literally walks back into her life.\n\nMacy met Elliot as a teen shortly after her mother died, and he quickly became her center of gravity as she visited the small town he called home on weekends. Christina Lauren tells their story from the past and present, showing readers how they became fast friends over books and adolescent secrets, how they fell into life-changing love, and the wreckage they were both left with when it all fell apart.\n\nAfter 10 years of no contact, Macy may finally be ready to tell Elliot why she went radio silent on him after one fateful night. They'll both have to decide if they can move on from the pain of the past for a chance at a joy-filled future, together.\n\nAchingly romantic and surprisingly funny, \"The Seven Year Slip\" by Ashley Poston is about meeting the right person at the wrong time, literally.\n\nClementine West has been adrift since her beloved aunt died. She thought living in the Upper East Side apartment she inherited from her would make her feel closer to her, as the apartment's magic had always drawn her in. Instead, she feels like she's just waiting for her aunt to walk through the door.\n\nThen, Clementine comes home one day to a man she doesn't know standing in her kitchen. Except, he thinks the apartment is his, for the summer anyway. He exists seven years in the past, staying in the apartment over the summer while Clementine and her aunt were in Europe.\n\nClementine isn't ready to be hurt by love again, but she might not be able to keep up her defenses against the sweet chef staying the summer. And if she does let herself fall, will they work together if she finds him again in the now?\n\nJustin and Emma are having the same dating problem. Everyone they date meets their soulmate immediately after they break up with them.\n\nWhen Emma sees Justin's viral Reddit post about his problem, she reaches out, and they decide to go on a date with each other in the hopes of breaking their curse.\n\nEmma, a traveling nurse, plans to stay in Minnesota for the summer and enjoy a fling with Justin during her short stay. The last thing either expects is to get immediately attached, especially when they both have family members counting on them come fall.\n\nDespite their best-laid plans, Emma and Justin's curse might have been leading them to each other all along in \"Just for the Summer\" by Abby Jimenez.\n\nTo the world, romance novelist Eva Mercy and acclaimed literary author Shane Hall have nothing to do with each other. That's because the only two people who know their books are inspired by each other are Eva and Shane.\n\nFor their entire careers, Shane and Eva have been writing secret love letters to each other, as the week they spent as teens glued to each other's sides in a rush of love still haunts them both years later.\n\nThey finally come face-to-face again when they both speak on a Brooklyn literary panel, and despite the years since they've seen each other, their chemistry is undeniable. Eva doesn't trust Shane after the way things went down between them, though, and as a single mom, she can't risk getting hurt again.\n\nStill, Eva has always been curious to know why Shane disappeared, and reuniting with him might be the key to breaking her writer's block.\n\nThe second-chance romance in Tia Williams' \"Seven Days in June\" will hit the spot for Henry's fans.\n\nOf Ali Hazelwood's nine romance novels, the coming-of-age story and yearning in \"Deep End\" are most similar to the themes of \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"\n\nNearly every moment of Scarlett Vandermeer's life at Stanford is accounted for. She spends her days in the pool as a member of the diving team or studying, laser-focused on achieving her goal of getting into medical school.\n\nA relationship or even a fling is the last thing on Scarlett's mind. Then, she finds out Lukas Blomqvist, Stanford's world champion swim captain who thrives on control, has similar interests to her when it comes to intimacy, and she thinks she might be able to make time in her busy schedule for something casual.\n\nLukas and Scarlett agree to explore their attraction together, deciding not to tell almost anyone about their arrangement. Scarlett doesn't think keeping her relationship with Lukas to herself will be a problem until she realizes the last thing she feels about him is casual.\n\n\"Same Time Next Summer\" by Annabel Monaghan offers another take on second-chance romance.\n\nSam's family's beach house on Long Island was her happy place in her childhood. She spent every summer there, and she was never happier than she was with her toes in the sand. Then, at 17, Wyatt broke her heart, and Sam couldn't face a summer there without him. She hasn't been back for more than a long weekend since.\n\nAt 30, Sam is making the trek from the city back to the beach, and she isn't the girl she was at 17. She's determined to succeed at her high-powered job and plan the perfect wedding with her fiancé, Jack, whose tendency to over-schedule their lives has become a comfort.\n\nOnly when she arrives, Sam discovers that Wyatt has returned to the house next door, and the entire adult life she created for herself begins to crumble. As old feelings come rushing back, Sam will have to take stock of who she is, who she wants to be, and who she really wants to live her life with.\n\nWhen Phoebe Stone arrives at the Cornwall Inn in Rhode Island, she's dressed to the nines and doesn't intend to ever check out. Her plans immediately go awry, though, when she discovers the entire hotel has been rented out for a wedding, and the attendees immediately assume she's one of the wedding people.\n\nSoon, Phoebe has no choice but to participate in the wedding festivities, especially because she and the bride keep telling each other their darkest secrets.\n\nAfter months of depression, the fanfare and plot twist of a stranger's wedding might just show Phoebe her own path forward.\n\nSlightly more melancholy in tone than Henry's works but still beautifully romantic, \"The Wedding People\" by Alison Espach is about the surprises life can bring when you least expect it.",

    "description": "Netflix staff engineer Anthony Goto said he's constantly asked by recent graduates how AI will change the industry.",
    "fullText": "Thanks to AI, everyone will be able to code. But a staff engineer at Netflix said that he tells recent grads that doesn't mean their job prospects are hopeless.\n\n\"We're going to see some amazing things, but our hunger for more functionality, more apps, more ecosystems is just gonna get higher, and higher, and higher,\" Anthony Goto said in a recent TikTok video. \"So, in the end, I think this is gonna be another, essentially, level of programming language, a high-level programming language.\"\n\nNew grads ask me all the time if AI means software engineers are done. Especially those preparing for Netflix interviews. This fear has happened before. AI is another layer of abstraction, not the end of engineering. #Netflix #NetflixInterview #SoftwareEngineer #TechCareers #AI\n\nGoto, who has 15 years of experience his time at Netflix and Uber alone, said that AI-related worries are among the top concerns he hears when he talks with recent graduates or employees he's mentoring.\n\nAnd to be fair, there is no shortage of takes about the future value of computer science degrees and the overall worth of coding knowledge, given the rapid advancements of agentic AI tools like Anthropic's Claude, which has led to \"vibe coding.\"\n\nOne way to stay competitive, Goto said, is for newer engineers to make sure they learn System Design.\n\n\"System Design is exactly what I am trying to ensure newer engineers get a handle on,\" he said. \"In the future, we may likely end up wielding system design like a tool.\"\n\nGoto points to the video game industry as an example of what's to come. Rapid advancements since the introduction of Doom in 1993 have spawned an industry that rakes in over $100 billion and regularly draws on Hollywood talent for its biggest releases.\n\n\"Picture someone from the year 2000, 2010, they go back in time, they go to John Carmack, and they say, 'Guess what? In the future, we're gonna have these things called video game engines,\" Goto said.\n\nLast year, Carmack, a video game legend who was the lead programmer of Doom, said that software progress has made some of the early grunt work he did \"as irrelevant as chariot wheel maintenance.\"\n\n\"Game engines have radically expanded the range of people involved in game dev, even as they deemphasized the importance of much of my beloved system engineering,\" Carmack wrote on X in April 2025.\n\nGame engines are now so powerful that they are used to create immersive digital sets and environments, such as those featured in Disney's hit series \"The Mandalorian.\"\n\nGoto admits that his prediction could very well be inaccurate, but based on the trajectory of past technological advancements, he sees a clear need for engineers.\n\n\"We've seen this many times before, where we abstract things away in a really powerful way,\" he said. \"And what it really does is democratizes the process.\"",

    "title": "Podcasts face a major test in 2026: Can they make it big on TV screens?",
    "description": "YouTube leads in podcast streaming while Netflix plans to launch 33-plus podcasts in 2026. Can video pods become the new TV?",
    "fullText": "Podcasts are increasingly making the leap to TV — and 2026 will be a significant test of the format's potential in the living room.\n\nYouTube, already the top streaming TV service, has solidified its position as the No. 1 destination for podcasts, too. Forty percent of monthly listeners called it their most-used service, trouncing Spotify (18%) and Apple (11%), according to a June 2025 survey by Sounds Profitable and Signal Hill Insights.\n\nNetflix is now looking to challenge YouTube with a slate of video podcasts set to roll out early this year. The streamer has at least 33 shows already in hand and has struck deals for the likes of Bill Simmons, Charlamagne Tha God's \"The Breakfast Club,\" and several Barstool Sports offerings. Netflix has told potential partners it wants to have 50 to 75 shows at launch.\n\nFox also made a significant investment in 2025 in podcasts. It acquired Red Seat Ventures, which handles production and ad sales for conservative hosts including Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Bill O'Reilly. It also signed a deal that brings \"Crime Junkie\" parent Audiochuck's shows to its free streamer, Tubi.\n\nAll this is encouraging to podcast insiders who love the prospect of seeing some competition for YouTube and more money flowing into the space. YouTube's ascent spurred many audio hosts to create video versions of their shows and also drew more influencers to the format.\n\n\"We're essentially an influencer medium,\" Greg Glenday, the CEO of leading podcast company Acast, told Business Insider. Acast has been looking to position its hosts as creators to broaden their appeal to advertisers.\n\nResearch shows that the definition of a podcast has expanded. A quarter of people polled by the Sounds Profitable survey said they thought of podcasts as either audio or video, up from 21% in 2024.\n\n\"What began as an audio-only medium has become a visual-first content format, essentially the modern-day counterpart to certain types of television programming that can also live in audio,\" Michael Calvin Jones, SVP of Wasserman Creators, recently told Business Insider.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how successfully podcasts can make the transition to TV. Will they truly become the next generation's version of a TV talk show? Some industry insiders think the potential for podcasts, which often consist of one or two people talking in a studio, to become a premium visual offering could be overstated.\n\nEven YouTube's rise could be, in some respects, misleading. Sounds Profitable's survey found that a lot of people still use YouTube to listen to podcasts as well as watch them.\n\n\"The numbers are saying more and more are watching podcasts on YouTube, but it doesn't mean they're actually watching them,\" said Adam McNeil, a podcast ad buyer at Adopter Media. \"YouTube is important for discoverability, but is it still very much an audio-based medium? I would say it is.\"\n\nWhether video podcasts can grow the podcast listening pie, or, in the case of Netflix, juice engagement or subscribers, is also still TBD. In the case of Bill Simmons, Netflix is presenting his sports talk show live on Sundays starting January 11, giving it a shot at being appointment viewing.\n\n\"They're not an acquisition lever like tentpole originals, breakout viral hits, or live sports,\" said Nick Cicero, founder of measurement company Mondo Metrics. Video podcasts could get people to increase their time and frequency on the service, help retain them as subscribers, and serve niche audiences, he said.\n\nNetflix's approach is also a gamble for the hosts. The streamer is getting hosts to pull their video shows off YouTube in its quest for exclusivity. But top independent creators often want to distribute their shows as widely as possible and value the real-time performance data and fan interactivity they get on YouTube.\n\nPodcasts have largely been a free, widely distributed medium, and being paywalled and exclusive to one platform has been the exception rather than the rule. Spotify tried to sew up top podcaster Joe Rogan and others, but moved away from exclusives after four years to maximize their distribution and ad sales.\n\nBeing on Netflix could expose hosts to a whole new set of viewers, but some industry insiders wonder if taking the shows off YouTube could mean losing fans who aren't motivated enough to seek them out on a new platform.\n\n\"I think it's a huge risk,\" McNeil said.",

    "fullText": "From Stanley Tucci’s imperious tech titan to Lex Luthor’s distractingly hot CEO and Elon Musk-esque blowhards, films this year took us inside the billionaire mindset\n\nBetween the slash-and-burn US government reboot led by a dank meme fan and the relentless pushing of AI by venture capital-backed blowhards, 2025 has felt like peak obnoxious tech bro. Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.\n\nWith such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto on The Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”\n\nThere was more baldness in Superman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage about perceived wokeness added a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.\n\nIs it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thriller M3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.\n\nIf Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr in The Naked Gun reboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.\n\nIn the goopy, grungy world of The Toxic Avenger reboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such as Bryan Johnson.\n\nIn 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulish Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby in Tron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully from the original 1982 Tron – seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.\n\nBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satire Mountainhead took the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.\n\nAs Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible. We have all been forced to absorb the pathologies of our tech overlords due to their disproportionate influence in the real world. As a new cinema year looms, is it too much to ask that we don’t have to keep doing it at the movies too?",

    "description": "Free streamers like YouTube have gained viewers, while growth at paid services like Disney+ and Netflix has slowed.",
    "fullText": "Free streaming services are having success, and it may be coming at the expense of their paid peers.\n\nYouTube and other free ad-supported services, such as The Roku Channel and Fox-owned Tubi, have become increasingly popular over the last two years, according to Nielsen's viewership data.\n\n\"For consumers, cost sensitivity is often a more important deciding factor than user experience,\" said Brandon Katz, a media analyst at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. \"Saving money outweighs the annoyance of terrible insurance commercials.\"\n\nAs these free streamers eat up a larger chunk of viewership time on US smart TVs, they may be holding back the growth of services like Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max.\n\nFree-to-access services YouTube, Tubi, and The Roku Channel have grown their viewership by 53% from December 2023 through November, according to a Business Insider analysis of Nielsen data. Those three free streamers make up nearly 18% of all watch time on US TVs, and that doesn't include Paramount's Pluto TV, which Nielsen broke out individually until March.\n\nIn that span, major paid streamers' collective watch time is only up 5%. That includes Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, and HBO Max, formerly known as Max. (Paramount+ was included until March, when Nielsen stopped reporting its individual share. And HBO Max's viewership includes sister streamer Discovery+.)\n\nThat means free streamers are growing more than 10 times faster than their paid counterparts, though the bulk of that growth is driven by YouTube, which has become a force in Hollywood.\n\nSlower engagement growth is a troubling sign for paid streamers. Viewership is positively tied to pricing power and inversely correlated with cancellations, meaning that people who watch a streamer more often are less likely to cancel.\n\n\"Engagement drives churn down,\" said Hernan Lopez, founder of media consulting firm Owl & Co.\n\n\"It's not just about hours spent,\" he added, but also the frequency that viewers return to an app and the breadth of content that they watch.\n\nEngaged streaming subscribers are also usually more receptive to price hikes, Katz said, since they likely place a higher value on the service than inactive users.\n\n\"The goal is to offer customers enough attractive content that opening the app becomes a regular occurrence,\" Katz said. \"At that habitual usage point, streamers are able to reasonably raise prices without fear of a mass exodus of customers.\"\n\nFor customers on ad-supported plans, higher engagement also translates to more ad revenue.\n\nIt's not all bad news for paid streamers. Streaming is an increasingly profitable business, thanks in large part to price hikes, which every major service (except for Prime Video) has implemented or announced in the past 12 months.\n\nDisney+, Hulu, and HBO Max have also continued to add customers this year. However, Peacock hasn't grown its subscriber base since the first quarter of 2025, and Netflix no longer reports its subscriber count on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe large gap between free and paid streamer viewership growth rates suggests that so-called stream-flation could be taking a toll. Media giants must walk a tightrope between pleasing Wall Street and pushing consumers toward free streamers, or apps like Instagram and TikTok.\n\nStreaming giants Netflix and Disney each have creative ideas for driving engagement in 2026.\n\nNetflix is turning to video podcasts in hopes of adding lean-back content that keeps subscribers engaged throughout the day. It's also been trying to use games as a way to create daily habits among its users.\n\nDisney is taking a different tack by betting on AI-generated video through a new partnership with OpenAI. This AI initiative will enable fans to create short clips of Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse or Darth Vader, eventually within the Disney+ app.",

    "description": "Remote work policies are changing at many large companies, including NBCUniversal and Paramount. Here's which media giants still allow remote work.",
    "fullText": "It was a year of RTO mandates in the media industry.\n\nThose issuing new guidance included media giants like NBCUniversal and Paramount Skydance, which this fall told thousands of employees to prepare to work in person four or five days a week in early 2026.\n\nWork-from-home policies haven't gone extinct at Netflix or its acquisition target, Warner Bros. Discovery, however. YouTube also has a flexible approach to remote work.\n\nHere's the latest on work-from-home and return-to-office policies at six major media and tech companies heading into 2026.\n\nParamount announced this year that it would be calling thousands of employees back to its New York and Los Angeles offices to work in-person five days a week starting January 5, 2026. The decision came in early September, less than a month after CEO David Ellison took charge after the Paramount-Skydance merger.\n\nStaffers who weren't up for in-person work were offered a severance package, which about 600 employees took, Paramount said in its third-quarter shareholder letter in mid-November.\n\nSome Paramount staff members can continue to work from home for now, including those based outside the US and those who were hired for fully remote roles. These employees who aren't assigned to the NY or LA offices will hear about \"Phase Two\" of Paramount's return-to-office plan in 2026, Ellison told employees in his September memo.\n\nParamount has been preparing its offices in NY and LA for an influx of remote workers by having employees in those areas work from home throughout December.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal followed in Paramount's footsteps, telling employees to report to its office four days per week starting January 5, 2026. NBCU staffers can still work from home on Fridays.\n\n\"In-person work and collaboration spark innovation, promote creativity, and build stronger connections,\" NBCU operating chief Adam Miller said in a memo to staffers about the change.\n\nNBCU also gave a severance offer to employees who weren't willing to return to the office. Notably, this exit package was one-size-fits-all, meaning that it wasn't dependent on how long staffers had worked for the parent of Peacock and Universal Studios.\n\nDisney's return-to-office edict came nearly three years ago in early 2023, when CEO Bob Iger called most Mouse House staffers back to the office four days a week.\n\n\"It is my belief that working together more in-person will benefit the company's creativity, culture, and our employees' careers,\" Iger told employees at the time.\n\nHowever, Disney's remote work policy isn't always enforced equally. Some staffers have told Business Insider that their managers strictly enforce the four-day rule, while others have said that their bosses are more lax about badge swipes.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery requires most of its employees to work in person three days a week, with a work-from-home option on the other two days.\n\nHowever, that policy could change if the company behind HBO and Warner Bros. Studios were bought by either Netflix or Paramount Skydance.\n\nYouTube-parent Google's remote work policy may be confusing, but it offers a certain level of flexibility.\n\nThe tech giant's remote work policy lets employees work from home two days a week. It also offers a \"Work From Anywhere\" program, allowing staff members to telecommute for four weeks a year.\n\nGoogle revised that \"Work From Anywhere\" policy this fall, CNBC reported, citing an internal memo telling employees that using one so-called \"WFA\" day in a week would count as using an entire week. That's because these \"WFA\" weeks are intended for use when employees work away from their homes or worksites, and not as a substitute for a work-from-home or paid-time-off day.\n\n\"The policy was always intended to be taken in increments of a week and not be used as a substitute for working from home in a regular hybrid workweek,\" John Casey, Google's VP of performance and rewards, said of the change in a call with employees, CNBC reported.\n\nNetflix hasn't set a companywide work-site policy, meaning that employees can be fully remote, work in the office every day, or anywhere in between.\n\nEmployees' working locations can vary by team and position, which a Netflix spokesperson said gives teams \"the information and freedom to make decisions that best suit their type of work.\"\n\nThat relaxed remote work policy has long been common among tech companies, though that's starting to shift — even at video-conference giant Zoom.",

Obviously, many people will be watching on Netflix. Every single time you see one of those guys run on the field with the orange gloves and say, TV timeout, or the players get a breather, they'll throw it back to the studio,\" said Long, \"Scott and I will be covering all the happenings from that drive, looking ahead, all the storylines you could think of. Obviously, as people watch, they will try to interact. We'll have multiple opportunities to engage in back-and-forth with people around the world.

I mean, I don't know if you're on social media, but there's been a lot of memes about the Minnesota Vikings, particularly their young quarterback, and what I've seen is that the defense has rallied around this guy. \"The protectors on the offensive side rally around this guy,\" said Long. \"You take a look around the NFC North, and the Bears and the Packers are the two teams most likely to make the playoffs. These two teams are fighting for respect, and they know that next year starts now, especially for a guy like J.J. McCarthy. We know how good their coach is.

    "description": "Amazon, YouTube TV, and Netflix dominate US sports streaming, accounting for 65% of the $6.5 billion spent by streamers on sports rights.",
    "fullText": "The NFL is giving sports fans a triple header for Christmas this year, starting with the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, plus a Snoop Dogg halftime performance. But you have to \n\nThe tech giants have eaten the entertainment world, and now they're coming for sports.\n\nTogether, Amazon and YouTube TV account for 65% of the $6.5 billion that streamers will spend on sports rights for US audiences in 2025 (34.4% and 30.6%, respectively), according to Ampere Analysis. The third biggest share went to Netflix, with 11.3%. Disney's ESPN+ and Comcast's Peacock held a distant fourth and fifth place.\n\nAmazon and YouTube have actively pursued significant deals for sports rights in recent years, with Amazon paying $11 billion for the NFL's Thursday Night Football and $19.8 billion for NBA rights, and YouTube paying $14 billion to secure NFL \"Sunday Ticket\" rights.\n\nNetflix has also been active, scooping up NFL Christmas Day games and the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, although it prefers to treat sports as part of a broader live events strategy that includes comedy specials and awards shows rather than \"renting\" full seasons of sports rights. A person familiar with Netflix's spending said they pegged it at about $600 million versus Ampere's calculation of $738 million.\n\nAmpere's data comes with a few caveats. Its measurements of eight platforms exclude spending for rights distributed internationally — such as Amazon's spending on NFL rights outside the US, or on the UEFA Men's Champions League within the UK — and for DAZN's acquisition of the global FIFA Club World Cup 2025 rights for $1 billion.\n\nBroadcasters remain the largest buyers of sports rights in the US, although streamers are making inroads.\n\nNearly half (47%) of US broadcasters' content spending — $24 billion — went to sports rights in 2025, per Ampere. Most of US streamers' content budgets still go to TV shows and films. This year, 10% of their content budgets overall went to sports in 2025, up from 6% in 2024. Even for Amazon, sports were about 19% of its spending on content, approaching the amount it spends on movies.\n\nSports can help streamers grow engagement and keep audiences subscribed. However, the rising cost of sports means less money for an already stagnating entertainment TV ecosystem that has been producing fewer shows since the end of Peak TV in 2022.\n\nDisney said in its fourth quarter earnings call that it would spend $24 billion in the next fiscal year, driven in large part by sports rights. CFO Hugh Johnston justified paying a more than 73% step up for NBA rights in its 2024 deal by pointing to their value to audiences and advertisers, despite the cost creating \"a little bit of bumpiness during the course of the year.\"\n\nNetflix compared its recent NFL deal to the cost of its movies, which it's been making fewer of. Asked about the cost of the deal at an investor conference last year, Netflix exec Spencer Wang said he would characterize each game as \"roughly the size of one of our medium-sized original films.\"\n\nThe shift of sports to streaming platforms looks likely to continue.\n\nAmpere forecasts global spending on sports rights to increase by 20% to $78 billion worldwide by 2030. Spending will be driven by the US, where new NBA and MLB rights will be up for grabs in the coming years. Talks for the next round of NFL negotiations could start as early as 2026, as the league seeks to maximize the value of its media rights.\n\nYouTube TV is also expanding its play for sports fans, announcing a new sports bundle along with other niche packages that cost less than its regular $83-per-month service.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. is in the middle of a tug-of-war between Netflix and David Ellison’s company, Paramount Skydance.",
    "fullText": "Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is raising the stakes in the battle for Hollywood’s future, personally intervening to salvage his son David Ellison’s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. On Monday, David’s company, Paramount Skydance, announced the elder Ellison had provided an “irrevocable personal guarantee” of $40.4 billion to finance the deal, directly countering claims that the company’s funding was unreliable.​\n\nIt’s the latest turn in the high-profile tug-of-war for Warner Bros. Discovery, one of the entertainment industry’s crown jewels. David Ellison, who became CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance in August, has been aggressively pursuing Warner Bros. with a $108 billion all-cash offer, which comes out to about $30 per share. However, WBD’s board rejected that proposal in favor of a rival agreement to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix for roughly $83 billion.​\n\nThe board’s rejection hinged largely on skepticism regarding the Ellison family’s financing. Last week, WBD directors dismissed Paramount’s funding as “illusory,” citing concerns that the capital was tied to a “revocable family trust” that could be altered or withdrawn before the deal closed. Larry Ellison’s Monday filing was designed to silence those doubts.\n\n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” the company said in a statement, adding that the tech tycoon has agreed “not to revoke the Ellison family trust (which has been operating for nearly 40 years as a counterparty to numerous transactions) or adversely transfer its assets during the pendency of the transaction.”​\n\nThis massive personal commitment—roughly one-sixth of Larry Ellison’s $247.3 billion estimated net worth—effectively removes the WBD board’s primary defense against the takeover. To further sweeten the pot, Paramount raised its proposed breakup fee to $5.8 billion, matching the termination fee included in the rival Netflix offer.​\n\nDavid Ellison argued that his company’s bid remains the only path that preserves Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole entity, rather than selling it off in parts. Netflix’s planned acquisition would exclude WBD’s Global Networks division, which includes CNN and other cable-native brands, and which WBD had previously announced plans to spin off.\n\n“Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on Dec. 4th, and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,” David Ellison said in a statement Monday. “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”​",

    "fullText": "This week, Chiefs Wire's Ed Easton Jr. spoke with WWE Superstar and long-time Chicago Bears fan Seth Rollins.\n\nIn his interview with Easton Jr., Rollins discussed his role as a special guest for NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix on Thursday, December 25th. He will be in attendance for the Detroit Lions at the Minnesota Vikings, providing insight on the NFC North rivals.\n\n\"Well, my hope at that point is that the Bears have locked up a spot in the playoffs, and I don't have to stress. However, they have a hell of a schedule coming up. They got Green Bay and San Francisco, then finished with Detroit,\" said Rollins, \"So for one night only, I will be a Minnesota Vikings fan. Don't tell anybody from Detroit. But yeah, I'm going to be rooting for the Vikings. I'm probably going to need them to take the Lions down a peg so that the Bears can lock in and get it done. But yeah, it should be a fun game.\"\n\nThe streaming service returns on Christmas Day with another NFL global doubleheader, following the Kansas City Chiefs' victory in last year's first-ever broadcast over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nGet ready for some action-packed Christmas magic 🎄 \n\nDallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders at 1 PM ET \nDetroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings at 4:30 PM ET \n\nLIVE on Netflix December 25 pic.twitter.com/pVUKmqtrCM\n\n— Netflix Sports (@netflixsports) December 3, 2025\n\nThe Vikings will rely on 2024 first-round draft pick J.J. McCarthy, who has been inconsistent due to injuries, while the Lions try to regain the dominant form that propelled them last season.\n\n\"Curious to see the progression of J.J. McCarthy and what he looks like in Kevin O'Connell's offense as he goes through sort of what his rookie year is. Obviously, he missed last season with the injury, but it's kind of his first go-around,\" said Rollins, \"Which Lions are we going to get? Lions from last year that dominated and maybe made an early playoff exit, or are we going to get a Lions team that misses the playoffs this season? It's going to be very interesting to see. Looking forward to the matchup, and yeah, I will be saying 'Skol' all afternoon.\"\n\nNetflix's inaugural NFL Christmas games in 2024 smashed streaming records, with the Chiefs vs. Steelers game averaging over 24 million U.S. viewers and reaching nearly 65 million unique viewers across the doubleheader, making it the most-streamed NFL games ever on the platform.\n\nRollins will star in WWE Unreal Season 2, premiering on January 20, 2026: https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-unreal-season-2-release-date-trailer-news.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: WWE Superstar Seth Rollins discusses Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

    "fullText": "Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua script, explained: Why boxing fans think 2025 Netflix fight was staged originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAnthony Joshua and Jake Paul duked it out on Netflix on Friday night.\n\nJoshua filled in for Gervonta Davis, who was initially booked to take on Paul. The fight was easy to market, with Joshua having legitimate boxing experience while Paul is better known for his social media presence.\n\nJoshua weighed in about 30 pounds heavier than Paul, and the two would usually be in different weight classes. The fact that they were even boxing was already suspect, and many, including every single person on the pre-fight panel, thought the fight would be over before the end of the third round.\n\nPaul danced around the ring for a couple of rounds and continually went to his knees, almost like he was going to go for a UFC-style takedown. The fight went into the sixth round, and many lost interest in how long it was taking Joshua to win and the product being shown.\n\nJoshua finally put Paul away in the sixth round, but that didn't stop fans from calling into question the legitimacy of the fight.\n\nHere is more on how the highly anticipated boxing match between Joshua and Paul ended.\n\nMORE: How did Sporting News score the Jake Paul-Anthony Joshua fight?\n\nThe public will likely never know for certain whether the fight between Joshua and Paul was staged. The recent trend in boxing has seen many social media stars and former boxers putting on outrageous fights, and the outcomes of some of them certainly make it look like foul play is involved.\n\nPaul planned to run away from Joshua and hoped to land a knockout blow. As he ran away from Joshua and repeatedly fell to his knees, many on social media not only called into question the legitimacy of the fight, but also quickly called it one of the worst in recent memory.\n\nJoshua said he knew he needed to take some time to wear down Paul, but once he didn't knock out his opponent in the first or second round, the internet determined the fight must be scripted.\n\nMORE: Which celebrities attended the Jake Paul-Anthony Joshua fight?\n\nThe exact number hasn't been confirmed. Reports ahead of the fight suggested that Joshua and Paul would get paid $184 million, making $92 million apiece.\n\nPaul took to his Twitter account and wrote, \"Stop asking me. $267 million.\" While he never expanded on the message, many assumed that this would mean that the total purse was actually $267 million, with each fighter presumably taking home $133 million each.\n\nJake Paul for no reason #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/OkUwtE1CBG\n\n— Ron (@Ronhotspur) December 20, 2025\n\n“THE FANS DIDN’T PAY TO SEE THIS CRAP.”\n\nSays the official of the match. #Jakejoshua\n\npic.twitter.com/ceypDh9djg\n\n— Lavish Sports (@LAVISHSPORTSORG) December 20, 2025\n\nMe after betting Joshua to win by KO in round 1 (he threw 1 punch total) pic.twitter.com/w9RzVvqRtT\n\n— br_betting (@br_betting) December 20, 2025\n\nJake Paul took Anthony Joshua down 😂pic.twitter.com/dgZlAD4dKg\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) December 20, 2025\n\nJake Paul doing something *slightly* decent, followed by one of these#JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/aRKxZWafnL\n\n— Alex Wallace (@AlexWTalks) December 20, 2025\n\nAnthony Joshua not knocking out Jake Paul in the first round gave it away that this was scripted #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/j5C5DBai8B\n\n— SWB 🌟 (@29xSWB) December 20, 2025\n\nJake Paul keeps rolling around on the ground like that australian breakdancer #JakeJoshuapic.twitter.com/ptAPOMbylu\n\n— ♡ｌａｕｒｅｎ ♡ (@laurennfarmerr) December 20, 2025\n\nSo Jake Paul sticking his tongue out was the sign for Anthony Joshua to end the fight?

There are quite a few options out there, so to make it easier to find them all, we've compiled all the Stranger Things board games, card games, and puzzles into the gallery below. As you'd expect, some of these are proving to be quite popular ahead of Season Five's conclusion. We've seen several of the games and puzzles linked below go in and out of stock--so if one of your favorites is gone, be sure to check back for restocks. Stranger Things Season Five's second batch of episodes hit Netflix on December 25, followed by the series finale on December 31.\n\nUp to six players can enjoy this cooperative game, as they comb through dozens of documents and investigate the bizarre happenings around the town of Hawkins. You'll need internet access for some of its puzzles--allowing you to access various files and even an old Walkman--though even folks unfamiliar with the series can help unravel this strange mystery.\n\nYour standard deck of cards gets a Stranger Things makeover with this fun set. The officially licensed set also comes with a collectible store tin, giving you a cool place to stash your cards when they're not in use.\n\nAnother set of playing cards, this time with a higher quality finish and more premium materials. Featuring holographic red and silver foils, these high-end cards are a nice alternative to the gift set above.\n\nTop Trumps is a simple card game that has you battling to collect all the cards in the deck. This rendition gets you cards featuring iconic characters from the show, including Eleven, Hopper, Mike, and even the Mind Flayer.\n\nThink you're a Stranger Things expert? Test yourself with this quiz, featuring 500 questions and a nifty storage container.\n\nPick up some Top Trumps cards along with a unique collector's tin. The tin is the big selling point here--featuring a Hawkins High School design, it's a cool bit of memorabilia for your home theater.\n\nSave Hawkins from a series of supernatural threats in this cooperative board game. It features events from the first two seasons, comes with 11 miniatures (including the Demogorgon and Eleven), and each match runs for about an hour.\n\nThe Mind Flayer is taking over Hawkins, and it's unclear who is under its control. This bluffing game sees \"Sane\" characters battling against \"Possessed\" characters, but the other players don't know which team you belong to. That means you'll have to bluff your way to success, while trying to determine who you can trust along the way.\n\nPlay through the last campaign of Eddie Munson. You'll get to go on four adventures that have you fighting Demogorgons and Demodogs, and the set includes everything you need to get started--such as retro cards, character sheets, dice, and a DM's screen.\n\nPut together a stylized image of a Demogorgon tangled in festive holiday lights. The finished puzzle is 21.25 x 15 inches, and you'll get a full-color poster as a bonus.\n\nLooking for a big project to work on? Check out this colorful 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, which features Eleven as part of the Nina Project. The completed puzzle is 26.75 x 19.75 inches, and you'll get a reference poster to help you along the way.\n\nPut together an iconic scene of the Stranger Things kids as they bike through the eerie streets of Hawkins. It's a big undertaking at 1,000 pieces, though no doubt it's one of the coolest designs up for grabs. Includes a reference poster and the finished project clocks in at 26.75 x 19.75 inches.\n\nPut together a cool panorama of various Stranger Things scenes. The main cast is shown off across the seasons here, making it a fun way to commemorate the finale on New Year's Eve.\n\nFeaturing a unique black, white, and red design, this 1,000-piece puzzle looks much different than the ones above. It adapts the artwork from the premium playing cards into a puzzle, though it keeps some of the holographic elements for a truly eye-catching design.\n\nWe're not sure if it'll allow you to communicate with the Upside Down, but you can definitely use it to build some cool, colorful designs. This version includes templates inspired by the show, such as the Hellfire Club Demon, Demodog, and Eddie's Guitar.",

    "fullText": "Netflix has signed ESPN’s Elle Duncan as its first sports anchor. As part of her multiyear deal, she will lead on-air coverage for Netflix Sports across the streamer’s diverse portfolio of growing sports coverage.\n\nHer first on-air hosting gig will be in early 2026 with “Skyscraper Live,” where free solo climber Alex Honnold will attempt to scale Taipei 101, the tallest building in Taiwan.\n\n“Joining Netflix feels like being invited to an already legendary party and somehow getting handed the aux cord!” Duncan said. “For a lifelong utility player, a multisport assignment is a full-circle moment, and being trusted with something this one-of-a-kind feels incredibly special and surreal. I’m bringing boundless energy, storytelling and bad puns no one asked for but will be subjected to anyway.”\n\n“Also, I was told this fast-tracks my kids to meeting the KPop Demon Hunters, so … win-win,” she added.\n\nDuncan comes from ESPN, known for her work on “SportsCenter,” “College GameDay” and “WNBA Countdown.” She specifically covered college and professional basketball, hosting “College GameDay” for women’s basketball across the country.\n\nNetflix has expanded its sports portfolio signing deals with the NFL, MLB, the Women’s World Cup, WWE, FIFA and more, so Duncan’s coverage slate will be diverse.\n\n“Elle Duncan’s proven ability to seamlessly move between hard-hitting sports analysis and warm, personality-driven cultural hosting makes her a perfect fit at Netflix,” Gabe Spitzer, vice president of sports at Netflix, said. “She immediately adds credibility and familiar star power to our global programming slate.”\n\nThe television host started her career in Atlanta, as an anchor for NESN and spending six years as an Atlanta Hawks sideline reporter. She joined ESPN in 2016, where she hosted the 6 p.m. ET edition of “SportsCenter” and held key roles across college and professional basketball. Her final “SportsCenter” appearance was Tuesday.\n\nThe post Netflix Taps ESPN’s Elle Duncan as First Sports Anchor in Multiyear Deal appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI (AP) — Jake Paul proudly boasts he has become the face of boxing during the past decade. Now the YouTuber-turned-fighter is ready to embark on his riskiest ring venture yet after 13 professional fights featuring a cross section of opponents that lack the active status and talent of his next rival.\n\nPaul will fight two-time heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua on Friday night at the Kaseya Center, home of the NBA’s Miami Heat. The scheduled eight-round bout will be streamed on Netflix without the pay-per-view designation.\n\nAlthough the 36-year-old Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) has not fought since September 2024, when he was knocked out by Daniel Dubois in five rounds, he is the prohibitive favorite to derail Paul’s ambitious fight plans.\n\n“The odds are stacked against me,” Paul said Wednesday in the fighters’ final media appearance before the bout. “There are no sporting teams in history that have gone together where it’s this big of a difference in terms of skills, experience, resume, height, weight. This is going to be the biggest upset in the history of sport and you guys get to witness it.”\n\nIn their photo standoff that closed Wednesday’s event, the 6-foot-6 Joshua towered over the 6-1 Paul. Joshua also has a six-inch reach advantage, 82-76. In addition, 12 of Paul’s bouts have been at the 200-pound cruiserweight limit.\n\nThe 28-year-old Paul (12-1, 7 KOs) has built his professional record through unconventional methods. He has victories over retired UFC champions Anderson Silva and Nate Díaz and also won a convincing decision against former middleweight titleholder Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.\n\nPaul’s ability to entice 58-year-old Mike Tyson to fight him last year further enhanced the circus-like atmosphere that often define his bouts. Yet, the bout against legendary heavyweight champion, which Paul won by unanimous decision, attracted 72,300 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight also generated a reported 108 million global views.\n\nFor all the followers Paul has won through his social media platforms, he acknowledges there are detractors who view him as an insult to the sport and the fighters who have traveled the arduous trek toward contention and championship opportunities.\n\n“No one has done more for the sport of boxing in the past decade than myself,” said Paul, who also has formed his promotional company that will oversee Friday’s nine-bout card. “I think if people really cared about boxing they’d want me to win.\n\n“I see the angle that they’re coming from – that (Joshua’s) the traditional boxer, that he’s been doing it for his whole life. But I think I’m more important for the sport of boxing. If they actually cared about the sport, they’d want me to win.”\n\nJoshua, who also won an Olympic gold medal representing his native England in the 2012 Summer Games, understands his perceived role as a boxing savior against Paul.\n\n“It just seems I’ve been called in to save the purest of boxing,” Joshua said. “People don’t like the fact that I’m fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question. If we look at the people that don’t want me to be here, they want me to put an end to the Jake Paul show. That’s why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.”\n\nJoshua’s bout against Paul will be his second in the United States. And Joshua wants to leave the ring Friday with a better outcome than in his debut, when Andy Ruiz Jr. knocked him out in seven rounds to end his first heavyweight reign six years ago at Madison Square Garden.\n\n“It was a tragedy. It was a loss,” Joshua said of his first professional defeat. “But if you’re in sports, it may happen. You may take some losses but the goal is to bounce back. Through tragedy there can always be a great story. This is just part of what my life is.”\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",

    "description": "The two-time unified heavyweight world champion will be significantly heavier than Jake Paul when the pair collide Friday on Netflix.",
    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua will outweigh Jake Paul by at least 27 pounds Friday in their controversial Netflix boxing match. The two fighters tipped the scales Thursday at the event’s official weigh-ins in Miami.\n\nJoshua, an Olympic super heavyweight champion and two-time unified heavyweight world champion, weighed in at 243.4 pounds for Friday’s heavyweight collision.\n\nPaul, who was previously preparing for a fight against 135-pound boxing world champion Gervonta Davis before Joshua stepped in on short notice, weighed in at a much lighter 216.4 pounds.\n\nThe vast size difference between the two fighters has been one of many divisive points ahead of this weekend’s matchup. Joshua is one of the most accomplished heavyweights of this era. Standing 6-foot-6 with a gargantuan 82-inch reach, he remains one of the top-ranked boxers in the world. He challenged for the IBF world title in his last fight — a September 2024 loss to Daniel Dubois at London's Wembley Stadium.\n\nBecause of the immense size and skill gap between the two fighters, Joshua was contractually not permitted to weigh-in heavier than 245 pounds.\n\nPaul vs. Joshua will be contested with 10-ounce gloves across eight three-minute rounds at Miami's Kaseya Center. Prelims begin at 4:45 p.m. ET and stream on Netflix's Tudum platform, while the main card begins at 8 p.m. ET and airs live on Netflix, free for all subscribers. Main event rings walks are expected around 10:30 p.m. ET.\n\nUncrowned will have full live coverage and round-by-round results of the action.",

    "description": "You might think the notion of Saudi money owning part of an American media giant would kill a deal. That's not why it's failed so far.",
    "fullText": "Larry and David Ellison, who own Paramount, want to use $24 billion in Middle Eastern money to finance their bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Is that a problem for WBD?\n\nYou might think so — especially since $10 billion of that came from the Saudi government. That's the same government that US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018. The kind of partner you might think a major American media conglomerate would want to keep at arm's length.\n\nBut that's not a problem WBD raises in its newest communication to shareholders, where it urges them to take the deal offered by Netflix instead.\n\nWhat actually worries WBD about the Ellisons' bid isn't the Ellisons' particular partners. It's that the Ellisons had partners.\n\nIn a regulatory filing that tells the backstory of the proposed WBD sale, WBD execs and their reps repeatedly told the Ellisons they wanted a firm commitment that Larry Ellison — currently the world's 5th-richest man, with an estimated net worth of $243 billion — would guarantee the deal himself.\n\nInstead, WBD argues, the Ellisons never gave them the assurances they wanted.\n\nThe filing does bring up the fact that money from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would likely complicate regulatory issues for a proposed Ellison/Paramount deal. (Ditto for a proposed $1 billion investment from China's Tencent, which the Ellisons later took out of their proposal.) But those are presented as technical hurdles. Not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\n\nAnd they're just part of a laundry list of complaints WBD makes about the Ellisons. Among them: A December 2 tweet from New York Post reporter Charlie Gasparino, which WBD said violated a confidentiality agreement Paramount had signed.\n\nAnd when it comes to the main pitch WBD is making to investors, all of that stuff disappears. It just boils down to \"we did our homework, and the Netflix deal is better.\"\n\nThat's not shocking: If you're a WBD investor, you are (supposedly) only interested in getting the maximum value for shares. And WBD's filing argues that Netflix is the one that can pay the most.\n\nNow we're waiting to see what the Ellisons do next: Many observers believe they'll return with yet another, higher bid. Will this one have Gulf money, too?",

    "fullText": "Netflix will exclusively carry three Barstool Sports video podcasts, marking the streamer's third major podcast deal. Netflix has been readying a slate of shows for early 2026 as it looks to enter the space dominated by YouTube.\n\nNone of the podcasts prominently features Barstool's famous founder, Dave Portnoy, who hosts \"The Unnamed Show.\" The deal also doesn't include Barstool's popular \"Million Dollaz Worth of Game,\" which ranked 33rd in US audience reach in the third quarter, as measured by Edison.\n\nPortnoy said in a statement that he hoped the deal would drive new audiences for the shows. Netflix pointed to the shows' \"unfiltered commentary, sharp takes, and undeniable humor\" as a reason behind the deal.\n\nNetflix has made similar deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia. As with those deals, the video versions of the Barstool shows will be pulled off YouTube and run exclusively on Netflix. The audio versions will remain available elsewhere. The deal includes new episodes and certain library episodes of each show.\n\nNetflix's move into video podcasts is part of a broader effort to expand its content offerings beyond its core of TV series and movies. The streamer has added content from YouTubers like Mark Rober, event-focused sports fare, and games as it looks to boost engagement time. Netflix is also aiming to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business.\n\nThe Barstool deal brings the total number of shows involved in Netflix deals to at least 33. Netflix has told some Hollywood agents that it wants to have 50 to 75 titles ready to go early next year.",

    "title": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount's bid and says shareholders should go with Netflix",
    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount Skydance and CEO David Ellison again. Read WBD's full letter to shareholders.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery still isn't interested in Paramount Skydance's offer.\n\nParamount's latest bid \"is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders\" compared to Netflix's bid, which \"represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders,\" said Samuel Di Piazza, the chair of WBD's board of directors, in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, WBD's board recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's all-cash bid of $30 per share in favor of Netflix's cash-and-stock offer. Paramount wants to buy all of WBD, including its cable channels, while Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share is for WBD's studio, HBO, and HBO Max. A key difference between the two bids revolves around the value of WBD's TV networks, such as CNN and TNT, which Netflix isn't interested in buying.\n\nDi Piazza said that Paramount's seventh proposal \"once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated,\" including about Paramount's financing.\n\nParamount has said its bid is fully backstopped by Larry Ellison, one of the richest people in the world and father to Paramount CEO David Ellison. The WBD board said in the letter to shareholders that it relies \"on an unknown and opaque revocable trust\" whose assets or liabilities are subject to change.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix is paying with cash and stock. Its shares have fallen recently but surged more than 600% from mid-2022 to mid-2025. Netflix has a market cap of over $400 billion.\n\nWhile Paramount has said that it would have an easier time securing regulatory approval than Netflix, the WBD board says it \"does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk\" between the two proposals.\n\nThe Ellisons are close to President Donald Trump. However, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has pitched the president on the deal and seems to have earned some respect. Trump has called Sarandos a \"great person,\" though he added that the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem\" on the regulatory front. Still, the president hasn't come out publicly in favor of one side in the deal.\n\nWBD also said its board \"repeatedly engaged\" with interested parties, including the Ellisons. Paramount had previously said that WBD went quiet late in the bidding process.\n\nNot even Paramount can be surprised by WBD's decision to stick with its Netflix deal.\n\nDavid Ellison was overheard saying last week that if WBD's leadership were to \"accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat's because Paramount said its $30-per-share hostile bid was nearly identical to its previous offer to WBD. Public companies are obligated to act in the best interests of shareholders. So if WBD's board had changed its mind, it could have opened itself up to shareholder lawsuits.\n\nWBD had said in a statement after Paramount's hostile bid that it would \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer\" in a way that was \"consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors.\"\n\nNow that WBD's board has given Paramount the cold shoulder again, it's Ellison's move.\n\nThe aspiring media mogul told CEO David Zaslav that Paramount's latest offer wasn't its \"best and final,\" which suggests that a higher bid could be coming. Just how much appetite Paramount has to escalate the bidding war is the key question.\n\nIf no higher bid comes, WBD's investors have until January 8 to back Paramount, though it could extend that deadline. WBD would owe Netflix a $2.8 billion reverse breakup fee if its shareholders chose Paramount.\n\nRead the full letter to shareholders here:\n\nAs your Board of Directors, we are committed to acting in your best interest. In this spirit, in October, we launched a public review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. This followed three separate proposals from Paramount Skydance (\"PSKY\"), as well as interest from multiple other parties.\n\nThat thorough process, overseen by the Board with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, as well as our management team, led to the company entering into a merger agreement with Netflix on December 4, with the substantial benefits to WBD shareholders described below. Having failed to submit the best proposal for you, our shareholders, PSKY launched an offer nearly identical to its most recently rejected proposal.\n\nAs a Board, we have now conducted another review and determined that PSKY's tender offer remains inferior to the Netflix merger. The Board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix merger, and that you reject the PSKY offer and not tender your shares.\n\nBelow, and in more detail in our 14D-9 filing, we highlight the many reasons for the Board's determination. None of these reasons will be a surprise to PSKY given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals.\n\nThe terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD.\n\nThe value we have secured for shareholders through the Netflix merger is extraordinary by any measure.\n\nOur agreement with Netflix gives WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, plus $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock (based on a collar range of $97.91 - $119.67 in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing), plus the additional value of the shares of Discovery Global and the opportunity to participate in future potential upside following Discovery Global's separation from WBD. The entire Board is confident in our recommendation that Netflix represents the best value-creating path for shareholders.\n\nPSKY has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a \"full backstop\" from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.\n\nPSKY's most recent proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding. Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was — and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming — the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.\n\nAnd a revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder. The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change. As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time. And the documents provided by PSKY for this conditional commitment contain gaps, loopholes and limitations that put you, our shareholders, and our company at risk.\n\nAmplifying the concerns about the credibility of the equity commitment being offered by PSKY, the revocable trust and PSKY have agreed that the trust's liability for damages, even in the case of a willful breach, would be capped at 7% of its commitment ($2.8 billion on a $108.4 billion transaction). Of course, the damage to WBD and its stockholders were the trust or PSKY to breach their obligations to close a transaction would likely be many multiples of this amount.\n\nWBD's merger agreement with Netflix is a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments. The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet. The debt financing for the PSKY bid relies on an unsecure revocable trust commitment as well as the credit worthiness of a $15 billion market cap company with a credit rating at or only a notch above \"junk\" status from the two leading rating agencies. The financial condition and creditworthiness of PSKY, which, if its proposed transaction were to close, would have a high gross leverage ratio of 6.8x 2026E debt to EBITDA with virtually no current free cash flow generation before synergies, raise substantial risks for its acquisition of WBD. Such debt levels reflect a risky capital structure that is vulnerable to even potentially small changes in the PSKY or WBD business between signing and closing.\n\nAdditionally, PSKY contemplates $9 billion in synergies from the mergers of Paramount/Skydance and their offer for WBD. These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.\n\nThe Board's review was full, transparent and comprehensive — establishing a level playing field that fostered a rigorous and fair process.\n\nThe Board repeatedly engaged with all parties, including extensive engagement with PSKY and its advisors over the course of nearly three months. We held dozens of calls and meetings with its principals and advisors including four in-person meetings and meals between David Zaslav and David and/or Larry Ellison and provided multiple opportunities for PSKY to offer a proposal that was superior to those of the other bidders, which PSKY never did.\n\nAfter each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions. Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.\n\nDespite PSKY's media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.\n\nThe Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the PSKY offer with its regulatory advisors. The Board believes that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material. The Board also notes that Netflix has agreed to a record-setting regulatory termination cash fee of $5.8 billion, significantly higher than PSKY's $5 billion break fee.\n\nThe offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion; it is not the same thing as a binding merger agreement. The first paragraph of the offer states it is \"subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time)\" and continues on the next page, \"we reserve the right to amend the Offer in any respect (including amending the Offer Price)\". In addition, the offer is not capable of being completed by its current expiration date, due to the need for, among other things, global regulatory approvals, which PSKY indicates may take 12-18 months. Nothing in this structure offers WBD shareholders any deal certainty.\n\nThe PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders.\n\nThere will be additional costs associated with PSKY's offer that could impact shareholders.\n\nWhen considering the PSKY offer at this juncture, it is important to note that its acceptance could incur significant additional costs to shareholders — all of which PSKY has ignored in their communications. WBD would have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee, which PSKY has not offered to reimburse. In addition, WBD would incur approximately $1.5 billion in financing costs if we do not complete our planned debt exchange as agreed to with certain of our debtholders, which would not be permitted by the PSKY offer. This additional $4.3 billion in potential costs represents approximately $1.66 per share to be borne by WBD shareholders if the offer does not close.\n\nWe look forward to moving ahead with our combination with Netflix and delivering the compelling and certain value it will create for shareholders. We urge you to carefully read the 14D-9 filed with the SEC this morning and available on our website, which more fully details the strategic review process and the Board's reasons for its recommendation to you.\n\nThe Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors",

    "fullText": "if you thought Drake’s bets were reckless, meet Hollywood producer Jon Peters.\n\nThe former head of Sony Pictures bet $5 million on Jake Paul’s Netflix fight against Anthony Joshua, and is so convinced that “El Gallo” will pull off the upset, Peters even convinced his children to wager separate bets, with a total combined payoff in the neighborhood of $50 million.\n\nPerhaps I was wrong about bettors “going broke.”\n\n“This is my first time I’ve ever bet on anybody in my life, other than myself, because I’ve been watching his career, and he’s like me,” Peters told TMZ Sports. “He’s like a weed that grew into an oak tree. When I talked to Jake on the telephone, and he [said] he would rather die than lose, I wanted to hear that. The other guy, is this just another win? He’s a champion. He’s also seven years, eight years older. I think Jake may knock him out in the first round. I’ve been a fighter my whole life. I know about fighting. I just believe it. And I have my kids betting on it, too. With everybody betting, we could make $50 million.”\n\nDon’t worry, his kids are “all millionaires.”\n\n“I already told [Jake] that I have options on a movie called Bullitt, Steve McQueen movie,” Peters added. “And I’ve been wanting to do it with Brad Pitt, but he’s a little old — and Paul is a movie star. Girls like him, kids like him, people like him. He’s a modern day phenom. But once he wins this, I think he will want to go fight that big, tall guy in England. The shorter guy can punch up easier than a big guy can punch down. When you punch down, you lose your power. When you punch up, you twist your legs, and you snap that punch into the ribs, and you snap that punch into the head, and bang, there you go.”\n\nHard to imagine this iconic car chase with “El Gallo” behind the wheel.\n\nI don’t know if this qualifies as “suspicious betting activity” but it’s certainly raising a few eyebrows when you consider all the sports-related betting scandals over the last several weeks. With this kind of money in play, it will be hard to dodge allegations of fight fixing if Paul, who was outboxed by Tommy Fury, somehow beats the 28-4 Joshua, a former heavyweight champion with scary knockout power and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nOne more reason to tune into Netflix on Friday night, I suppose.",

    "description": "Netflix's podcast deal with iHeartMedia brings exclusive video podcasts like \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"My Favorite Murder\" to the streamer in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Netflix just made its second big podcast move, announcing a deal with iHeartMedia to exclusively host the video versions of more than a dozen of its shows.\n\nThose shows include \"The Breakfast Club,\" cohosted by popular radio personality Charlamagne tha God; true crime show \"My Favorite Murder\"; and \"Dear Chelsea\" with Chelsea Handler.\n\nNetflix said the shows will launch on its platform in early 2026 in the US, with other markets to follow.\n\nNetflix stressed the variety of the shows available through the deal. Bob Pittman, iHeartMedia's CEO, said it let his company complement its audio foundation with a leading video-first service. The video versions of the shows will only be available on Netflix — and crucially won't be on YouTube — while iHeartMedia retains the audio-only rights and distribution.\n\nThe deal is Netflix's second big foray into video podcasts after announcing a similar deal with Spotify in October for shows including \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" \"The Rewatchables,\" and \"Conspiracy Theories.\"\n\nNetflix's move into video podcasts is part of a broader effort to expand its content offerings beyond its core of TV series and movies. The streamer has added content from YouTubers like Ms. Rachel, sports programming, and even games as its engagement time has flattened. Netflix is also seeking to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business.\n\nBesides its Spotify and iHeartMedia deals, Netflix has explored potential pacts with individual podcasters, including Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame, two people familiar with the talks previously told Business Insider. Netflix has also been looking to hire a video podcast executive.\n\nThe streamer told potential partners it wants to have 50 to 75 shows when its video podcasts launch in early 2026, two dealmakers previously told Business Insider, with one hearing the platform was looking to build that number to as many as 200 over time.\n\nThe iHeartMedia deal checks a few boxes for Netflix, which, in keeping with its stated goal of serving everyone, has been seeking shows across various genres, including pop culture, true crime, sports, and comedy. \"The Breakfast Club\" is the 15th most listened to podcast, according to Edison Research, and its daily format could help Netflix establish itself as a routine destination. The deal notably doesn't include iHeartMedia's other podcasts in the top 50, including the flagship \"Stuff You Should Know,\" \"Club Shay Shay,\" and \"On Purpose with Jay Shetty.\"\n\nNetflix's podcast negotiations have, in general, been complicated by the fact that video distribution rights are often controlled by a mix of the host and the network.\n\nFor some podcasters, being on Netflix offers a potential new audience and the prestige of being part of a curated offering. However, for others, Netflix's demand for video exclusivity would mean giving up the important ad revenue and reach they gain on YouTube, and potentially alienating their fans who find them there.\n\nThere are also questions about how much Netflix will promote the shows and what viewer data it'll share with hosts, who are accustomed to receiving robust data on their shows from YouTube.\n\nPodcasts are mostly an audio experience, but people are increasingly watching them in video form. An Edison Research report in July found that over half (51%) of people in the US 12 and up said they had watched a video podcast, with 37% having watched one in the previous month.\n\nHere are all the shows initially coming to Netflix as part of the iHeart deal:",

    "description": "Netflix and Warner Bros. have a deal, but regulators must approve the move. The question of how to define Netflix's market is a major consideration.",
    "fullText": "Would buying Warner Bros. give Netflix too much power?\n\nThe streaming giant is telling regulators it won't, and antitrust experts say the answer ultimately depends on how you define who Netflix competes with.\n\nDoes Netflix compete with only paid streaming services, a market where it dominates? What about the TV dinosaurs it disrupted, or the social video services nipping at its heels? Could sleep even be a competitor, as its cofounder Reed Hastings famously suggested?\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance has slammed the Netflix-Warner Bros. mega-deal as anticompetitive, arguing that it would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription video streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the Warner Bros. library (stocked with fare like Harry Potter and DC Comics).\n\nNetflix, for its part, is advocating for a definition that considers total US TV viewing time. The streamer, which has expressed confidence in its regulatory case, pointed to this in a letter to its employees on Monday.\n\n\"Even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US — still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%),\" Netflix's co-CEOs wrote on Monday, citing Nielsen data. A Netflix spokesperson referred to those remarks when asked for comment.\n\nConvincing antitrust regulators of that could be an uphill battle.\n\n\"Antitrust regulators are likely to define the relevant market narrowly,\" said Anthony Palomba, a business professor at the University of Virginia. \"The FTC and DOJ have consistently treated streaming as a discrete competitive arena, separate from linear television, theatrical distribution, or social video platforms.\"\n\nThe president has said the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem.\"\n\n\"They have a very big market share, and when they have Warner Brothers, you know, that share goes up a lot,\" he said of Netflix.\n\nReuben Miller, the head of antitrust at financial data service Dealreporter, said Netflix's bid would \"be challenged and litigated unless Netflix can convince Trump to come down on their side.\"\n\nHere's how regulators could determine Netflix's competitive market and, by extension, the future of the media business.\n\nA Netflix-Warner Bros. combination would be a colossus. Netflix and HBO Max have accounted for 39% of US paid subscription streaming revenue in 2025, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAny firm with 30% to 40% market share has historically drawn scrutiny from the US government. If regulators see paid streamers as a distinct market, Netflix's Warner Bros. deal could be in trouble.\n\nConsumers may not view social media apps — even when they are watched on a TV screen — as close substitutes for Netflix, Disney+, or Hulu, Palomba said. If so, a Netflix-HBO Max combination could limit choice or lead to price hikes.\n\nThere are few recent parallels to Netflix's Warner Bros. acquisition, Dealreporter's Miller said. One could be Charter Communications, which was allowed to expand its cable operation in 2016, though streamers were in their early days then. Miller said it felt like the government was protecting the nascent streaming industry. However, consumer behavior has changed so dramatically since then that he's unsure if those market definitions would be applicable.\n\n\"The incentive is to start with the assumption that a merger is illegal,\" Miller added. \"They're going to start with as narrow a definition as possible, so they'll probably start with paid streaming. And then the onus is on Netflix to try and get them to expand that market definition.\"\n\nAlthough Netflix is easily the most viewed paid streamer in the US, it's not the top streamer on TV screens.\n\nThat would be free YouTube, whose viewership share has soared relative to Netflix in recent years. At the end of 2022, Netflix and YouTube each commanded 7.5% of viewership on US TVs. But as of October, YouTube had a 12.9% share while Netflix took second place at 8%, according to Nielsen.\n\nAlong with its paid peers, Netflix is also battling free streamers like The Roku Channel and Fox's Tubi that are popular among Gen Z.\n\nWhen adding free streamers into the marketplace, Netflix and HBO Max together accounted for just over a fifth of US streaming minutes in October, MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote on Monday. While 20% share is powerhouse status, it might not be a dealbreaker from an antitrust perspective.\n\nNetflix has argued that it's competing against all of traditional TV, not just streamers.\n\nIts viewership share ranks sixth among TV media distributors, versus its second-place spot in streaming. When measured against cable and broadcast TV, Netflix's 8% share in October was slightly behind the 8.2% share for Paramount, which includes its cable channels and CBS.\n\nAnd since Netflix isn't trying to buy WBD's cable networks like CNN, it could argue that it's only adding a fraction of the media conglomerate's viewership time.\n\nNetflix would undoubtedly love a broad definition of its competitive market that includes TikTok, Instagram, and even video podcasts and video games, which are also spaces where the streamer competes.\n\nSome media insiders see an ultra-broad competitive landscape as a bridge too far.\n\n\"My clients are not pitching shows to YouTube,\" a TV agent said.\n\nCorey Martin of LA-based law firm Granderson Des Rochers said that \"to compare Netflix to YouTube, or even TikTok, is like comparing apples and oranges.\" He said the same applied to video games.\n\nConsumers tend to think of paid streamers like Netflix or Disney+ when they want to watch movies, TV, or sports, Martin said, but \"they don't necessarily think about YouTube or TikTok.\"\n\n\"Directly, it's hard to say that a video game is competing with a movie, or a video game is competing with the TV, even though they do consume our attention,\" said Rahul Telang, a business professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nHowever, some see truth in the idea of an all-consuming battle for attention.\n\nBernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said Netflix may be a leader in long-form video, but others have better sports offerings. Yoon also wrote in a mid-December note that attention has shifted to short-form video on Instagram and TikTok, and even new micro dramas.\n\n\"Critics may claim these are apples and oranges, but we heard the same argument about linear vs. streaming only a decade ago,\" Yoon wrote.",

    "title": "Read the letter Netflix's co-CEOs sent to reassure staffers about its bid to buy Warner Bros.",
    "description": "Netflix laid out the rationale for acquiring Warner Bros, saying the deal is: \"pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth.\"",
    "fullText": "Netflix's co-CEOs want to assure staffers that its bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's key assets will be good for the company — and for jobs across Hollywood.\n\nIn a letter sent to staffers on Monday, a copy of which was also filed publicly with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos said a combined Netflix-Warner Bros. is \"pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth.\"\n\n\"We see this as a win for the entertainment industry, not the end of it,\" the Netflix co-CEOs wrote, addressing concerns that the combo of the streaming giant and one of the most iconic studios could bring about \"the end of Hollywood.\"\n\nNetflix this month announced its intention to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for an equity value of $72 billion, which would be the biggest acquisition in the streamer's history.\n\nRival Paramount Skydance responded days later with a hostile bid to acquire all of WBD in a deal valued at around $108 billion.\n\nPeters and Sarandos addressed the hostile bid in the letter, saying it was to be expected but that Netflix has a solid deal in place.\n\n\"It's great for our shareholders, great for consumers, and a strong way to create and protect jobs in the industry,\" they wrote.\n\nThe letter reiterated Netflix's previous arguments for why it's the best bidder for the WBD assets. Its bid faces strong opposition in parts of Hollywood, where many have long harbored suspicions toward Netflix because of its business model that has upended traditional film and TV conventions.\n\nIn particular, Netflix has favored a streaming-first distribution approach and has a practice of putting its movies in theaters for limited runs only. This has created tension with some big-name talent and movie theater owners. Sarandos previously said long, exclusive theatrical windows weren't \"consumer-friendly,\" and that he thinks, over time, theatrical windows will continue to shrink.\n\nIn terms of regulatory approval, both bidders have made the case that they have the clearest path to getting a deal through. Paramount chief David Ellison has said its combo would lead to less market concentration in streaming than Netflix's.\n\nNetflix, for its part, wants regulators to compare its market share to total TV watching time, including free platforms like YouTube. The co-CEOs emphasized this in a letter. They say Netflix plus Warner Bros. would only be 9% of the US market, behind YouTube and Disney. Paramount's argument is that the market should be defined by paid streaming, which is growing and where Netflix stands to expand its dominance.\n\nA wild card is President Donald Trump. David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, are close to Trump, whereas Sarandos has long-standing ties to prominent Democrats. Still, Trump has publicly praised both Netflix and Sarandos. Trump also said that a combo of Netflix and Warner Bros. \"could be a problem\" due to the size, however.\n\nWhen it comes to jobs, Netflix has lobbied Trump that it would be a job saver, not a job killer, since it wouldn't be combining two big studios like Paramount would. Some key numbers to look at are the planned \"synergies,\" which often translate in part to job cuts. Paramount estimated $6 billion, compared to Netflix's $2 billion to $3 billion.\n\nRead the letter from Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos to staffers in full below:\n\nBy: Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos\n\nAs news around our deal with Warner Bros. continued this week, we wanted to keep you as informed as we can. Our position hasn't changed: we strongly believe that Netflix and Warner Bros. joining forces will offer consumers more choice and value, allow the creative community to reach even more audiences with our combined distribution, and fuel our long-term growth. We made this deal because their deep portfolio of iconic franchises, expansive library, and strong studio capabilities will complement—not duplicate—our existing business.\n\nThis is going to be a complex process over the next year or so and there's a lot we won't be able to share, but we did want to give you our thoughts on some of the most pressing questions we've heard since we connected last week.\n\nHow do we feel about Paramount's hostile bid? It was entirely expected. But, we have a solid deal in place. It's great for our shareholders, great for consumers, and a strong way to create and protect jobs in the industry. We're confident we'll get it over the finish line—and we're genuinely excited about what's ahead.\n\nAre we confident regulators will approve? We believe in this deal—in the value it creates— and we're confident we'll get the approvals we need to make it happen. The fundamentals are clear: this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth. Also, if you look at it through the lens of Nielsen data, even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US—still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%). We believe the facts speak for themselves, and we're fully prepared to put ourselves in a strong position for approval.\n\nWill we preserve theatrical releases as part of WBD's distribution model? Yes—we're fully committed to releasing Warner Bros. movies in theaters, just as they do today. Theatrical is an important part of their business and legacy, and we don't want to change what makes Warner Bros. so valuable. If this deal had happened two years ago, hits like Minecraft and Superman would still have premiered on the big screen as they did—and that's how we plan to keep it. We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix. When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\n\nSome feel this is the end of Hollywood. What's our response to that? This is something that we've heard for a long time—including when we started the streaming business. Our stance then and now is the same—we see this as a win for the entertainment industry, not the end of it. This deal is about growth: Warner Bros. brings businesses and capabilities we don't have, so there's no overlap or studio closures. We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.\n\nWhat's next? We've got a small but mighty team of experts working on this so the rest of us can stay focused on the big 2026 ambitions we've established for our business. We've got huge potential still ahead of us—even before we factor in Warner Bros.—so our focus should remain on realizing that potential based on our organic growth. We know that's easier said than done with all the headlines and speculation, but continuing to deliver for our members is the best thing we can focus on.\n\nWhere is the best place to follow along? As a reminder, Take 5 is for employees only. We've launched a public site as our source of truth for external audiences—which will be updated further—and it's a resource you can share with friends and family who might have their own questions. You can also listen to our UBS webcast from earlier this week.",

    "description": "Carl Rinsch was found guilty of defrauding Netflix when he went on a spending spree instead of finishing \"White Horse.\" We got some of the footage.",
    "fullText": "When Netflix executives first saw a glimpse of \"White Horse\" in 2018, they were blown away.\n\nCindy Holland, who at the time oversaw the streaming service's original content, read the script sitting in Keanu Reeves' home, she said in court testimony earlier this month. \"White Horse\" was the brainchild of Carl Rinsch, who had previously directed Reeves in the big-budget \"47 Ronin.\"\n\nAt the time, Rinsch had already created a trailer and six preliminary episodes of \"White Horse,\" funded in part with his own money. Holland testified she found the footage \"stunning\" and the script \"really impressive.\"\n\n\"I believed we should pursue the project,\" testified Holland, who is now an executive at Paramount.\n\nNetflix agreed to pay tens of millions of dollars on the project, but \"White Horse\" was never finished. Instead of premiering on the nation's biggest streaming platform, \"White Horse\" has become the subject of legal disputes, news articles, and, finally, a criminal trial against Rinsch in Manhattan federal court.\n\nIt culminated in a guilty verdict on Thursday, where a jury found Rinsch guilty of defrauding Netflix by using the $11 million on a personal spending spree.\n\nOver the years, the public has seen very little of the sci-fi passion project that wowed Netflix executives into shelling out $55 million for the project — until now.\n\nWhite Horse\" depicts a world with artificially created \"Organic Intelligence\" beings, which resemble humans. When the world discovers they're not flesh-and-blood humans, the artificial beings create their own private cities, walled off from the rest of the world, and form their own society.\n\nIn 2018, Netflix agreed to pay $44 million for Rinsch to deliver about 13 episodes, ranging from about four to 14 minutes and totaling about 120 minutes. It gave Rinsch an additional $11 million in March 2020 to finish \"White Horse\" — money the jury found he spent on luxury goods instead of finishing the show.\n\nThe lack of public images has made it difficult to understand why a major entertainment company would agree to spend $55 million on \"White Horse\" and why Netflix continued to infuse cash into the project after Rinsch exceeded his initial budget.\n\nNetflix even gave Rinsch coveted \"final cut\" privilege, effectively giving him ultimate creative control over what \"White Horse\" would look like, despite \"47 Ronin\" flopping at the box office.\n\nSome of the work that went into the production made it into the evidentiary material for Rinsch's trial, including six episodes that Rinsch created with his own money, before Netflix agreed to invest in the project.\n\nProsecutors played the trailer for jurors, then asked former Netflix executives about their high hopes for \"White Horse\" — and the disappointment and anxiety that followed as the production fell apart.\n\nPeter Friedlander, another Netflix executive, testified early in the trial that he was \"blown away\" by Rinsch's \"visionary\" footage.\n\n\"The visuals were something that I had never seen before,\" Friedlander said.\n\nRinsch's defense lawyers showed jurors concept art that Rinsch and his production team created to illustrate the elaborate sci-fi world the director had built. Rinsch — a protégé of \"Alien\" and \"Gladiator\" director Ridley Scott — described \"White Horse\" as a potential franchise on par with \"Star Wars\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nAfter Netflix agreed to pay Rinsch for the project, the writer-director-producer spent months filming hundreds of hours of footage in Brazil, Uruguay, and Hungary, using the production codename \"Conquest.\"\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, Rinsch \"abandoned\" \"White Horse\" after running out of money in the fall of 2019. He swindled Netflix out of the additional $11 million the streaming service agreed to pay him the following March, prosecutors said.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Rinsch's attorney Daniel McGuinness urged the jurors to watch the six episodes — which totaled about 40 minutes — while they deliberated the verdict.\n\nIt was absurd, McGuinness said, to think that Rinsch planned to scam Netflix through the production of the project when he had put so much creative energy into making it a reality.\n\nAccording to Rinsch's defense attorneys, the director believed that the bulk of the $11 million March 2020 payment was meant to reimburse him for cost overruns he had paid out of his own pocket.\n\nRinsch continued to work on \"White Horse\" throughout 2020 and in 2021, his lawyers said.\n\nTo demonstrate this, the attorneys pointed to additional concept art that he had commissioned and created himself.\n\nThe artwork featured architectural and costume designs, which Rinsch said would go toward a potential second season.\n\nMuch of the concept art depicted scenes in a castle. Trial records showed that Rinsch booked Palais Liechtenstein, a castle in Vienna. Rinsch testified he wanted to film additional scenes there, but he believed Netflix decided to scrap \"White Horse\" altogether before that could happen.\n\nAccording to one draft of Rinsch's screenplay, two twin-like \"Organic Intelligence\" beings would rule over their society and then betray each other in a Shakespearean fashion, legal records show.\n\nThe concept images for the unfinished scenes, entered into evidence in Rinsch's criminal trial, depict an apparent murder, with one of the beings lying on the floor in a pool of golden blood. The scene is not included in Rinsch's preliminary episodes.\n\nProsecutors said Rinsch's concept art was a fig leaf. Pointing to an agreement between him and Netflix, they said Rinsch was supposed to spend the entire $11 million infusion on finishing the first season — not just a small fraction of the sum for concept art. One prosecutor described the funds Rinsch paid to book the castle as \"a $30,000 down payment on an $11 million fraud.\"\n\nOne of the prosecution's arguments centered on Rinsch's purchase of multiple Rolls-Royces.\n\nRinsch testified that the cars would be used for what he called the \"Calvacade\" — a procession of cars that shuttled diplomats through the \"no man's land\" between the \"Organic Intelligence\" beings' independent cities and the human world.\n\nIn closing arguments, Assistant US Attorney David Markewitz turned the concept art against Rinsch.\n\nHe pointed the jury to planning documents that showed he had planned to shoot the \"Calvacade\" scenes in Brazil in 2019 — two years before he purchased the Rolls-Royces under his own name. On insurance records, Rinsch had said the cars were for himself, not for a Netflix production.\n\n\"At an even more basic level, you know it would make no sense to actually buy five Rolls-Royces just to shoot a few scenes with them,\" Markewitz told the jury.\"\n\nShortly before a sober-faced jury walked out of the deliberation room and announced they found him guilty of all counts, Rinsch said he was happy a journalist at Business Insider had watched the six preliminary episodes and understood his vision.\n\n\"I'm glad you watched it,\" he told Business Insider. \"It means a lot to me.\"",

    "description": "Prosecutors accused Carl Rinsch, who directed the Keanu Reeves-starring \"47 Ronin,\" of fraud after an ambitious sci-fi Netflix project collapsed.",
    "fullText": "Carl Rinsch spent years in director jail. Now he's facing real jail.\n\nA Manhattan federal jury on Thursday found Rinsch guilty on charges that he scammed Netflix out of $11 million in a lavish spending spree.\n\nAfter less than five hours of deliberation, the jury said it found Rinsch guilty on all seven counts, including fraud, money laundering, and illegal money transmission. He faces up to 90 years in prison, but is expected to receive a far less severe sentence.\n\nMost of the 12 jurors walked into the jury box with somber expressions on their faces. Rinsch, wearing a purple-plaid tie and matching pocket square, looked straight at the judge with a neutral expression as the foreman read the verdict.\n\nRinsch and his attorneys declined to comment to Business Insider while leaving the courtroom.\n\nThe case centered on the millions of dollars Netflix paid Rinsch to film \"White Horse,\" a sci-fi epic about a world where clone-like beings, after a schism with humankind, create their own society walled off from the rest of the world. Rinsch testified in his own defense earlier this week.\n\nRinsch — a Ridley Scott protégé who previously directed the Keanu Reeves-starring \"47 Ronin\" — shot footage for \"White Horse\" on two continents. But by the fall of 2019, he exceeded the $44 million Netflix budgeted for the project and asked for more money.\n\nIn March of 2020, after months of negotiations, the streaming service agreed to give Rinsch's production company another $11 million.\n\nOn the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Rinsch said he believed the bulk of the $11 million was meant to reimburse him for keeping the production of \"White Horse\" afloat the previous fall, when it had gone over-budget. He testified that Netflix expected him to conduct only \"soft pre-production\" on a potential second season.\n\nRinsch had grand ambitions. He said he envisioned a franchise like \"Star Wars\" and \"Game of Thrones,\" complete with an elaborate fantasy world, that could become part of Netflix's catalogue.\n\nFormer Netflix executives testified in the trial that they had previously agreed on one season, and the $11 million was meant to go toward finishing episodes that Rinsch never delivered. According to prosecutors, the entire negotiation for the $11 million was a sham, and Rinsch meant to defraud the company all along.\n\nAt closing arguments on Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney David Markewitz presented the jury with a Buzzfeed-style list of \"10 Ways You Know Carl Rinsch is Guilty.\" He argued it was absurd to think Rinsch's risky stock and cryptocurrency trades, as well as his lavish purchases — such as a $439,000 handmade Hastens mattress — could have been intended for the production of \"White Horse.\" He also pointed out that Rinch's 2021 purchases of Rolls-Royces were insured in his own name, rather than insured by Netflix.\n\n\"In a TV show, a mattress is going to be covered by sheets and a blanket,\" Markewitz told the jury. \"No one watching 'White Horse' from home is going to have any idea what is under those linens.\"\n\nDaniel McGuinness, an attorney representing Rinsch, told the jury that Rinsch never had the \"intent\" required to find him guilty.\n\nRinsch always believed Netflix owed him about $11 million in reimbursement, McGuinness said, pointing to emails and text messages leading up to the March 2020 agreement, and never said he would spend all the money on additional production for \"White Horse.\"\n\nIn reality, according to McGuinness, the situation was a \"contract dispute\" based on misunderstandings between Rinsch and Netflix.\n\n\"They were talking past each other, and the government has turned it into a nefarious fraud conspiracy,\" McGuinness said.\n\nJurors sent multiple notes to the judge on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning. They asked for transcripts of key witness testimony and an additional laptop to review the trial exhibits.\n\nBut shortly after noon on Thursday, they had come to a unanimous conclusion: Rinsch was guilty.",

    "fullText": "The media war between Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, and Paramount is raging on.\n\nParamount Skydance's CEO, David Ellison, sent a letter to WBD shareholders on Wednesday, urging them to tender their shares in support of Paramount's bid for WBD.\n\n\"It is not too late to realize the benefits of Paramount's proposal if you choose to act now and tender your shares,\" Ellison said in the letter.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix announced that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion, after WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid for WBD, for $30 per share.\n\nIn the letter, Ellison also slammed WBD's advisors for not giving equal weight to Paramount's offer, compared to Netflix's, and described the sales process as being \"opaque.\"\n\n\"To suggest that we are not 'good for the money' (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd,\" he said.\n\nHe said that WBD advisors \"never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers.\"\n\nEllison added that WBD did not grant Paramount a \"single 'real time' negotiating session,\" and had \"sprinted towards a deal with Netflix.\" He said WDB ignored texts from him and his advisors in which they said their $30-per-share offer was not their best and final one.\n\nRepresentatives for WBD did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about Ellison's accusations in the letter.\n\nAfter Paramount launched the hostile bid, Ellison pitched the deal to his own staff in an internal memo on Monday, as seen by Business Insider. He told his staff that the combination of Paramount and WBD would be a \"powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Ellison said at a Tuesday UBS event that he knew why WBD could not accept his latest offer.\n\n\"If they accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty, so I don't think they can just take that,\" Ellison said.\n\nThe bid is partially financed by the wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe media war has not escaped the notice of President Donald Trump, who said he would be involved in the deal. He said on Sunday that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"",

    "fullText": "The Hollywood bidding war between Paramount Skydance and Netflix has created a meme frenzy.\n\nThe two media giants are in an all-out battle for Warner Bros. Discovery after it accepted Netflix's offer to acquire its studio and streaming businesses for an equity value of $72 billion. David Ellison's Paramount launched a hostile $30-per-share bid for all of WBD on Monday.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery owns the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, the HBO Max streaming service, and TV networks such as CNN, TNT, and TruTV. It confirmed receipt of Paramount's unsolicited offer on Monday.\n\nBoth entities have made their cases on why they'd be the best owner for WBD. Although internet comedians don't have a say in where the deals land, it hasn't stopped them from weighing in with viral jokes about the dueling companies and their quest to acquire WBD.\n\nSome social media users are poking fun at the back-and-forth with memes about how far each company is willing to go to gain WBD's favor. One post compared the battle for the best offer to a scene from the HBO business drama \"Succession,\" a title Netflix would own if the deal goes through.\n\nA post shared by Karl Smith, CFA (L1 Candidate) (@wallstreetintern)\n\nThe Instagram meme account Litquidity used parody images that appeared to be AI-created of two business leaders speaking at the DealBook Summit to mock how each company is trying to prove its offer is better.\n\nNetflix and Paramount trying to show off why their Warner Bros acquisition offers are better pic.twitter.com/mjpP7sjAnA\n\nSome people seem to be using humor to cope with the idea of more consolidation in Hollywood. They are pushing back on both offers with memes about stopping the looming acquisition completely.\n\nChristopher Nolan, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg on their way to stop Netflix from buying Warner Bros: pic.twitter.com/pnCAU4kclM\n\n\"I'm putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger,\" one X user captioned a compilation video of various actors and famous filmmakers.\n\nI’m putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger: pic.twitter.com/wl26YfGCjg\n\nOthers speculated on what the movie-watching experience could be like under Warner Bros. Discovery's new ownership. One TikTok video showed a man sitting down to watch a movie, only for the intros to include a confusing mix of studios, backers such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and even a DJ, being played before the movie began.\n\nevery company is every company #business#news #netflix\n\nIn the midst of all the jokes, Netflix argues that its offer would be better for consumers and creators, while Ellison says Paramount is more likely to win regulatory approval and offers Hollywood more certainty.\n\nWhat all of this means in the long run is unclear so far. It could lead to job cuts in the entertainment industry as the giants consolidate their power. The trends of streaming services getting pricier and fewer movies hitting theaters could also continue, as companies release less content, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEither way — as with many serious big business deals — consumers and industry insiders are finding ways to laugh through it.",

    "description": "Paramount's David Ellison wants to buy all of Warner, including its cable networks. How much they're worth is a big part of his fight vs. Netflix.",
    "fullText": "The fight between Paramount and Netflix over Warner Bros. Discovery is ultimately about who gets to control HBO and the Warner movie studio.\n\nBut the way that fight gets settled is going to involve an unusual side quest: CNN, TNT, the Food Network, and a bunch of other cable networks WBD wants to get rid of. Specifically: What are all of those shrinking cable networks worth?\n\nWhich leads us to a pretty weird place: Paramount CEO David Ellison, who wants to buy all of WBD — including its cable networks — is arguing that those cable networks aren't worth very much at all. And Netflix, which doesn't want to buy those cable networks, is implicitly arguing that they're worth much more.\n\nThat's because in the Netflix scenario, current WBD shareholders would go through two transactions: First, WBD would spin out its cable networks into a new company, and WBD investors would be given shares in that new company. Then Netflix would buy the remainder of WBD — HBO and the studio — for cash and stock.\n\nWhich means Netflix, and WBD executives who have blessed the Netflix offer, will want investors to think the cable networks are valuable. Ellison wants them to think the opposite.\n\n\"The lower you value the cable assets, the greater advantage Paramount's bid has. If shareholders believe the cable operations are more highly valued, then Netflix's bid, which assumes they will be spun off, means investors get an overall bigger sum of money.\"\n\nAnd here's the actual gap: Ellison says the spin-off is worth about $1 per WBD share — or roughly $2.5 billion, based on WBD's current valuation. Independent analysts think it might be closer to $4 per share — or roughly $10 billion. Paramount and Netflix reps declined to comment; WBD hasn't responded to my request.\n\nSo one side is describing a rounding error, especially when it's part of a deal that could be worth $108 billion. The other is describing, more or less, a midsize media company.\n\nAnd yes, this is equity value, not enterprise value — this already assumes the spin-off gets saddled with billions of WBD's debt under the Netflix plan. But we're going to focus this conversation on the shares that ultimately end up in a WBD investor's brokerage account.\n\nAnd if you believe David Ellison and Co., those investors aren't getting much. Because CNN, Turner, and all of the networks formerly owned by Discovery aren't worth much at all.\n\nAnd yes, the cable network industry is a falling knife, which is why many big media companies that own cable networks are trying to ditch them. But are things really that bad?\n\nMaybe. Maybe, using Ellison's math, all of CNN plus a pile of other cable networks — which still generate cash, mind you — are worth about 16 Bari Weisses, based on the reported $150 million he paid for her Free Press site.\n\nOr maybe all of that is worth $10 billion — which means it's still less than 1% of Google. Which feels like a metaphor for the entire media industry in 2025: Even a roomful of famous brands barely registers in a world run by giant software companies.\n\nSomewhere in that $2.5 billion to $10 billion range is the real answer. But the headline is clear: The networks that once held the entire cable bundle together are now garage sale leftovers. Worth something to someone — but a whole lot less than they used to be.",

    "fullText": "Jake Paul is set to face Anthony Joshua on Netflix next Friday December 19th, and everyone is very excited to see ‘“The Problem Child”’ encounter a problem he probably can’t solve. For years he’s prayed on older, over the hill MMA fighters like Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva. Now he faces a legitimate two-time heavyweight and Olympic boxing champion.\n\nWith that at the top of the card, it’s unsurprising that people have largely forgotten about much of the undercard. But there’s some interesting stuff there, including the aforementioned Woodley and Silva fighting each other in a boxing match.\n\nWoodley has come closer than anyone else to knocking out Paul, nearly derailing the YouTuber-turned-boxer’s hype train in their first 2021 fight. He hopes to prove he’s still got it against “The Spider,” and he’s had some surprising help preparing for the fight.\n\nTyron Woodley may have biggest balls in MMA. Respect to both OGs pic.twitter.com/dnaFINl9ld\n\n— Jake Paul (@jakepaul) November 21, 2025\n\n“I’m doing [Road House 2] right now, so a lot of us are training and getting ready for fight scenes,” Woodley told BettingLouge. “There are a lot of martial artists around, and specifically Michael ‘Venom’ Page, who is a perfect replica to train with to get ready for Anderson.”\n\n“More than just a fighter, he’s got a phenomenal mind for the sport,” Woodley said of “MVP.” “He’s almost stepped into a coaching role for me, especially with accountability. I feel comfortable with him saying, ‘You need to do this more, don’t do that,’ because he fights a similar style to Silva: flashy, elusive, open-space striker, very quick, hard to hit, hard to grab.”\n\n“Pinning him in a corner of the ring, landing shots on him, dealing with his unpredictability gives you the same type of anxiety someone would feel preparing for Anderson.”\n\nI’ll never forget that time when Tyron Woodley rocked Jake Paul and had the chance to end him but didn’t pull the trigger 🤔 pic.twitter.com/jKOUqZycQy\n\n— Moslee (@thefan763922) November 24, 2025\n\nWoodley promised that his fight with Silva will ‘steal the show,’ and he needs a big performance to prove he’s still capable of victory. His last win came in 2018 against Darren Till. Following that he lost four in a row to close out his UFC career and then dropped two boxing matches to Jake Paul.\n\n“I get a chance to beat somebody that I feel like is a legend,” Woodley said. “And I want to be left as a legend. Like, some people may say, ‘Okay, you’re already a legend.’ But I don’t feel that way yet. And I feel like beating somebody like Anderson Silva gives me a fight and a victory that I’m proud of.”\n\n“My kids will benefit from it, because they’ll see their dad succeed, and bounce back, and they’ll see the comeback season, but this is for me. It’s not personal against him, but it’s personal for me going out there and not holding back, and letting go, and freeing my hands up, it’s been a chain that I’ve always wanted to break.”\n\nWoodley has always had a piston of a right hand but got strangely tentative using it in the latter part of his career. When he hit Paul with it in their first fight, he didn’t jump on the Disney kid. He held back and it cost him the fight. Is “T-Wood” finally in a place where he’s ready to go out there and fire at will? Against a dangerous counter-striker like Silva, it could be dangerous.\n\nNo guts, no glory, and Woodley sounds like he really wants that glory.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",

    "description": "The fight between Netflix and Paramount over who will buy Warner Bros. is heating up. Here's what markets are thinking about the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "A bidding war has broken out over one of America's most iconic media companies, and investors in the three firms involved are mixed on the prospect of where it'll all shake out.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery have climbed on the back of a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance to acquire the film and television company, but they're still slightly below the competing bid from Netflix, which was announced as the winner of the sale process last Friday.\n\nParamount on Monday made an all-cash offer worth $30 a share to acquire Warner Bros. and its film studio and streaming services.\n\nIt's unclear which way Warner Bros. will go. The company's board of directors said on Monday that it wasn't changing its recommendation regarding its agreement with Netflix, but would review Paramount's offer over the next two weeks. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nMarkets, though, are flashing some clues about what investors think might happen next. Here's what to watch.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose to $27.70 on Tuesday, just below Netflix's offer of $27.75 a share.\n\nIf the stock were to surpass that level, that could be a sign investors expect Warner Bros. to go with Paramount's offer, or that they expect Netflix to put together a better offer, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I would say that there's a combination of both of those things probably in play right now,\" Hogan said of investors pricing in both scenarios, though he noted that trading activity in Warner Bros. Discovery shares may also be reflecting uncertainty among investors as Paramount revealed its hostile bid on Monday.\n\nThere's also the issue of regulatory approval, which could explain the slight discount in Warner Bros. Discovery stock to Netflix's offer price. Comments from Donald Trump on Monday suggested Netflix's ownership of Warner Bros. could draw scrutiny from the administration.\n\nIn a statement after it unveiled its offer, Paramount said its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery would offer shareholders around $18 billion \n\nNetflix stock is down 7% since last Thursday's close, with shares dropping through Friday's session as investors digested the news that the media giant would acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio business.\n\nInvestors rarely reward the acquirer in a large M&A deal like this, and it appears they're also not thrilled about the prospect of a fierce bidding war.\n\nNetflix stock continued to slide through Monday's session on news of Paramount's competing bid, and dipped again on Tuesday. The streaming platform has agreed to pay Warner Bros. $5.8 billion if its deal doesn't go through.\n\nShares of Paramount Skydance, meanwhile, jumped on Monday on enthusiasm for a potential deal, but the stock slipped 3% on Tuesday.\n\nBettors don't see Paramount's hostile bid going through with ease. While Paramount has edged up slightly over Netflix on some open bets on Polymarket, other wagers have its chances of acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery by mid-2026 at less than 50%.\n\nOn Polymarket, bettors see a 43% chance Paramount will be the winning bid, compared to a 39% chance priced in for Netflix.\n\nOn Kalshi, the odds that Paramount will win are about 50-50.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance and Netflix bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, highlighting streaming, Hollywood jobs, and regulatory approval in their rival pitches.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's latest high-drama battle of the titans: Paramount versus Netflix.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount made a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery after WBD rebuffed its multiple offers and accepted Netflix's offer to buy its studio and streaming business.\n\nThis means Ellison, who is backed by his billionaire father, Larry Ellison of Oracle, is making his case directly to shareholders on why he'd be the best owner for WBD.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"\n\nNetflix didn't respond to the hostile bid but has said that by combining its streaming hits with WBD's classic library and prestige HBO fare, it can supercharge its offering.\n\n\"Together, we can give audiences around the world even more value and choice, and get one step closer to being the most loved and the most valued entertainment company,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in announcing the deal Friday.\n\nHere's how the companies made their cases to various stakeholders, which include investors, employees, Hollywood talent, and regulators.\n\nFinancials: Paramount offered $30 per WBD share for all of WBD, compared to Netflix's offer of $27.75 per WBD share for its streaming and studios business, excluding its TV networks, such as CNN and TNT. While Netflix's offer was a mix of cash and stock, Ellison emphasized that Paramount's offer is all cash, and $17.6 billion more than the Netflix deal, an $82.7 billion offer that includes $72 billion in equity.\n\nApproval: Ellison repeatedly argued that he's more likely to win regulatory approval than Netflix is. He said he anticipated approval coming in as little as 12 months. President Donald Trump said he'll be \"involved\" in evaluating the deal. Larry Ellison is a longtime ally of Trump, and the firm of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is part of the Paramount offer.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Ellison argued that the Paramount deal would be good for jobs and consumers. He said Paramount is committed to growing the film and TV output of both businesses, including a theatrical slate of 30-plus releases a year. It's a pointed contrast with Netflix, whose preference for getting movies onto its streaming service quickly has created friction with the film industry. (Netflix has said it would continue to release Warner Bros. movies in theaters.) Ellison said adding WBD would make Paramount a robust competitor to Netflix, while Netflix buying WBD would extend its dominance in streaming and give it more power to raise prices to consumers.\n\nFinancials: Netflix said the deal would give it a number of financial benefits. While Netflix is the top subscription streaming service, it has a ways to go in creating culture-defining IP. A big part of Netflix's pitch is that it'll be able to build on WBD's famous franchises like DC Comics and Harry Potter, fueling a flywheel that'll expand its business. WBD would have to pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it accepts a different offer, which Netflix said limited its risk. On the other hand, Netflix would have to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee if the deal were blocked by regulators.\n\nApproval: Wall Street analysts have generally characterized Netflix as having a tougher approval path. However, the company has been making the pitch to Trump and his administration. Trump said Sunday that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos visited him last week. Trump said Sarandos was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" However, Trump added that Netflix has \"a very big market share,\" which \"could be a problem.\" Netflix expressed confidence in the approval process, saying it expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, after WBD completes its spinoff of linear channels into a new company, Discovery Global.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Netflix said the deal would provide better choice and value for consumers by bringing together the Warner Bros. film and TV show libraries with its own offerings, and help the WBD's creators reach a bigger audience. Netflix said many of its subscribers don't \n\nWith Hollywood employment stagnating, Netflix also argued that the addition of Warner Bros. would let it expand its production and increase jobs over the long term. It expects to achieve $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings from the deal, primarily coming from eliminating overlapping support staff. Sarandos contrasted this with a Paramount outcome.\n\n\"In the offer Paramount is talking about today, they're talking about $6 billion of synergies,\" he said at a UBS conference on Monday. \"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"",

    "description": "David Ellison is officially chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance after an $8 billion tie-up. Next on his wish list: Warner Bros Discovery.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is officially the CEO of Paramount Skydance. After a successful Paramount merger, next on his wish list is Warner Bros. Discovery — and he's launched a hostile takeover bid in an effort to scoop it out from Netflix's hands.\n\nThe 42-year-old founded Skydance back in 2006 with some help from his father Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder who's worth $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSince then, Skydance has enjoyed considerable success with films including \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\" and \"Baywatch,\" and a total box office haul of more than $8 billion. The merger deal valued Skydance at $4.75 billion.\n\nIts biggest hit has been \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which became the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 after making almost $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\nAfter seeing the original \"Top Gun\" as a child, David Ellison became obsessed with flying. His billionaire father bought him a plane at the age of 13 and they took flying lessons together. By 17, Ellison had begun competing in air shows performing aerial acrobatics.\n\nHe gave up flying competitively after starting a film degree at USC that he later dropped out of, Ellison told Kara Swisher in an episode of The New York Times' \"Sway\" podcast.\n\nBefore becoming an entertainment executive, though, Ellison had a brief foray as an actor.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in a Skydance film called \"Flyboys,\" about American pilots who flew for the French Air Force in World War I.\n\nThe movie cost about $65 million, but flopped after taking just $18 million or so, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSince moving behind the camera, Ellison's company has had a relationship with Paramount that dates back to 2011 when Skydance co-financed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"True Grit\" with the studio.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success, winning 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and taking about $200 million at the box office.\n\nEllison's sister, Megan, is also in the movie game. Her production company Annapurna Pictures was behind releases including \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" \"Her,\" \"American Hustle,\" and \"Phantom Thread,\" all of which received Oscar nominations.\n\nThe $8 billion tie-up of Skydance and Paramount officially closed in August. Ellison named himself chairman and CEO of the newly combined company, Paramount Skydance.\n\nSoon after taking the helm, Ellison led Paramount Skydance through layoffs, which can be common in the wake of a merger. The company laid off 1,000 employees in October and said that more cuts were coming. Six hundred employees took severance packages and quit instead of returning to the office, it said.\n\nEllison has also installed Bari Weiss at the top of CBS News. Weiss left The New York Times Opinion section in 2020 and later built the The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance acquired for about $150 million.\n\nEllison continued his spending run. He brought in Netflix veteran Cindy Holland and shelled out $7.7 billion for UFC rights.\n\n\"Everywhere you look, he's throwing money,\" LightShed Partners media analyst Rich Greenfield told Business Insider. \"That's what Hollywood gets excited about.\"\n\nNow, Ellison has his eye on another acquisition: Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount Skydance had earlier entered a competitive bid against Netflix and Comcast to acquire the company.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery ultimately accepted Netflix's bid to purchase the company's streaming and studio business for $72 billion.\n\nEllison is now fighting to stop that from happening. On December 8, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for WBD, offering to pay shareholders $30 per share for the entire company.\n\nThat morning, Ellison made his case to shareholders and WBD's board on CNBC.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"",

    "fullText": "Before Netflix made its winning bid for Warner Bros., its co-CEO pitched President Donald Trump directly on the merits of the deal.\n\nThe pair found common ground, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said.\n\n\"The president's interests in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said of Trump at the UBS media conference on Monday afternoon.\n\nSarandos said he'd talked to Trump \"many times since the election about the different challenges facing the entertainment industry.\"\n\n\"The president cares deeply about the entertainment industry, and he loves the entertainment industry,\" Sarandos continued.\n\nTrump praised Sarandos on Sunday, calling him a \"great person\" who he said had done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" Still, Trump said Netflix's \"big market share\" in the streaming space \"could be a problem\" as it tries to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.\n\nThe Netflix-Warner Bros. deal reached on Friday is worth $82.7 billion, including $72 billion in equity. WBD's TV networks like CNN or HGTV, aren't in the proposal.\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance responded on Monday with a hostile bid in the form of a $30-per-share, all-cash offer for all of WBD, including the declining TV networks. Netflix's offer is $27.75 per share, comprising mostly cash and some stock. There's debate among analysts about whether Netflix's or Paramount's renewed offer is more attractive, as it depends on the value of WBD's TV networks.\n\nParamount's move \"was entirely expected,\" Sarandos said.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison, who Trump has publicly praised, went on CNBC on Monday morning to tout his company's offer as \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\" Ellison said his company's offer had \"faster regulatory certainty to close\" than Netflix's. Ellison's father, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally and one of the richest people on the planet.\n\nHowever, Netflix also seems to be building rapport with Trump. That could help explain why Netflix's Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters are optimistic about their deal.\n\n\"We are very confident that regulators should, and will, approve it,\" Peters said of the WBD deal.\n\nSarandos pitched the streaming giant's proposed acquisition as a net positive for the labor market, despite the concerns of many in Hollywood. He also said the company is \"deeply committed\" to releasing movies from Warner Bros. in theaters, \"exactly the way they've released those movies today.\"\n\nThat overture could help ease Trump's concerns. Sarandos pitched Netflix as a great job saver.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos warned that Ellison would implement lots of layoffs if his bid won and said the Paramount CEO promised about $6 billion in cost savings from a WBD deal. Those so-called \"synergies,\" in analyst jargon, translate to a smaller workforce, Sarandos said.\n\n\"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,\" Sarandos said. \"We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"\n\nNetflix has promised investors $2 billion to $3 billion in its own cost savings from its Warner Bros. deal, however.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",

    "description": "Is HBO Max dead, and will you be able to watch 'Game of Thrones' on Netflix?",
    "fullText": "After initial reporting from The Wrap revealed that Netflix had won the bidding war for Warner Bros., the streamer stepped in on Friday to confirm that it has a deal with the Warner Bros. board to acquire the home of HBO and HBO Max, DC Comics, and Bugs Bunny for $82.7 billion. The acquisition would put an end to merger attempts from the likes of Paramount and Comcast, but it's also far from a done deal.\n\nAccording to Netflix, its acquisition of Warner Bros. will need to wait until at least Q3 2026, to allow room for the previously announced Warner Bros. and Discovery split to go through, as Netflix does not plan to buy the Discovery part of the business (including its cable channels). Additionally, the deal will need to go through regulatory approval. Given these roadblocks, the companies expect \"to close in 12–18 months.\"\n\nThe news of the acquisition follows Warner Bros.' announcement in October that it was open to a sale, at least partially motivated by its split with Discovery.\n\nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. The Wrap reported that Netflix's deal with Warner Bros. includes a $5 billion breakup fee in case regulators block the deal, pointing to some anxiety from both companies. To that end, CNBC reported that \"a senior [Trump] administration official\" has said that the government is looking at the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" and The New York Post and the Wall Street Journal both reported that Paramount (which recently completed its own merger with Skydance Entertainment, led by Trump ally David Ellison) is currently warning the administration away from allowing the deal. To that end, the BBC reported over the weekend that Trump said the merger \"could be a problem.\"\n\nParamount is also not done bidding, it seems. The company announced a $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid this morning, bypassing the board and offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery shares from shareholders at a premium. Notably, if accepted, the deal would include the whole of Warner Bros. Discovery, despite the upcoming split, which would also give Paramount access to cable networks like CNN and TBS. In its announcement, Paramount called out the Netflix deal as facing a \"challenging regulatory approval process,\" implying that it would better be able to negotiate with the administration.\n\nHow regulators will respond to the purchase remains to be seen, but if the deal does go through, it will mark a major shift for both Hollywood and consumers. Netflix hasn't laid out complete plans for how the merger would affects its customers, but in its press release, it has offered a few hints. Should a combined Netflix and Warner Bros. come to pass, here's how you can expect it to affect you.\n\nSince Netflix's primary business is as a streaming app, the most obvious result of a Warner Bros. acquisition would probably be the shuttering of HBO Max, and the inclusion of its content into Netflix proper. However, it seems like we're more likely to get a Disney+/Hulu situation, with the company running both services simultaneously.\n\nIn its post announcing the merger, Netflix said it will \"maintain Warner Bros.' current operations,\" and that HBO and HBO Max would be viewed as a \"compelling, complementary offering\" for its customers.\n\nWhether that means Netflix subscribers will get complementary HBO subscriptions, or if they will simply be able to add HBO onto their plans as complemental \"content,\" is unclear, although I would expect the latter interpretation to be the correct one. After all, Disney charges an additional fee for users who also want to There would be little reason for Netflix to not follow suit.\n\nThis is backed up by another line further into the press release which states that, \"[b]y adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.\" That implies HBO is something you'll add to an existing subscription, rather than content that will just become part of a base Netflix subscription, with the company saying the acquisition \"also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers.\"\n\nNetflix already offers a small smattering of shows originally developed for either HBO or HBO Max, such as Sex and the City and Scavenger's Reign. This is due to pre-existing content sharing agreements, but it's possible Netflix may continue to offer some HBO content to its existing subscribers for free, even if it continues to operate HBO as a separate entity.\n\nFor instance, Netflix says in the merger announcement that \"shows and movies such as The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz and the DC Universe will join Netflix's extensive portfolio.\" While this is likely simply acknowledging acquired IP, I wouldn't be surprised to see some select shows hit Netflix from time to time, either to prop up sparse release schedules or to promote HBO subscriptions/add-ons.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Greg Peters also says in the release that, \"[w]ith our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they [Warner Bros.] create.\" He adds this would be an opportunity to attract, \"more fans to our best-in-class streaming service.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is most known to consumers as an app, its large selection of original content also means that it operates as a production studio. Netflix says that it will use the acquisition of Warner Bros. production side to \"enhance Netflix's studio capabilities, allowing the Company to significantly expand U.S. production.\"\n\nThis means that viewers might expect to see more original Netflix content in the future, specifically more American-made shows in the vein of Stranger Things, alongside localized foreign programming like Squid Game.\n\nAlongside its movie and TV businesses, Netflix will also be acquiring Warner Bros. Games, a spokesperson confirmed to Game Developer. That means the company will now be responsible for publishing both licensed works, such as the Batman Arkham series, as well as gaming originals, like the Mortal Kombat series. Little is known about how Netflix will handle suddenly being in charge of these longstanding AAA series, but given the company's recent gaming ambitions and its promise to continue Warner Bros. operations as usual, it's likely these titles will continue in some capacity.\n\nIn addition to suddenly stepping into big-budget, AAA gaming, Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. also means it's getting control of DC Comics' print business alongside its film and TV businesses, as the publisher is wholly owned by Warner Bros. That's another big step for the company, although given that DC's print business serves largely as the foundation of lucrative IP such as Superman and Batman, it's likely Netflix will do its best to keep operations there as smooth as possible. However, readers might expect some Netflix and DC synergy, similar to when Marvel started publishing new Star Wars comics shortly after Disney acquired Lucasfilm. Batman visiting the Upside-Down from Stranger Things might be more likely than you'd think.\n\nFinally, while Netflix's past movie releases have often relied on direct-to-streaming drops complemented by just enough of a theatrical presence to qualify for awards, Netflix said in its release that it plans to continue distributing Warner Bros. produced movies as usual, \"including theatrical releases for films,\" but that the exclusive theatrical window may shrink. In other words, The Batman 2 probably isn't going to get the Knives Out or KPop Demon Hunters treatment, but theater exclusivity for Warner Bros. movies might not be as long going forward.",
