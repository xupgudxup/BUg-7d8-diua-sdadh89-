The new island features four named locations based on the town of Hawkins, Indiana, as well as a border right down the middle separating the normal world from locations that have been corrupted by the Upside Down--essentially giving the map a pair of distinct biomes, something that Blitz hasn't done before since its map is already so little.\nThe map and the new item shop skins based on Vecna and the original four boys are the entirety of this takeover--there aren't any new Stranger Things weapons added to the loot pool or anything like that. That's fine, because between the ongoing Simpsons season and the imminent launch of Chapter 7, we've already got plenty of new mechanics to worry about.",
